    "dwarf novae are a subset of cataclysmic variables consisting of a white dwarf accreting matter from a roche lobe - filling , low - mass secondary star .",
    "they undergo outbursts ( brightness increases of 3 - 7 magnitudes ) lasting for days to weeks separated by intervals of quiescence lasting weeks to years .",
    "the outbursts are thought to be caused by the release of gravitational potential energy when matter in the disk periodically accretes onto the white dwarf .",
    "the trigger for the accretion episode is widely held to be the disk instability mechanism ( e.g. , cannizzo 1998 and references therein ) . during outburst ,",
    "these systems are dominated by a luminous accretion disk , a high rate of accretion , and wind outflow .",
    "the spectra during quiescence are more difficult to interpret and generally exhibit a mix of absorption and emission features with a continuum energy distribution which may or may not be consistent with an accretion disk .    in this paper",
    ", we utilize composite white dwarf photosphere plus accretion disk synthetic spectra to model the poorly understood far uv spectra of dwarf novae in quiescence .",
    "our approach is described in winter & sion ( 2003 ) and was also applied to the hst spectra of rx and ( sion et al . 2001 ; sepinsky et al .",
    "our approach is most useful for dwarf novae in which we can not easily identify the dominant light source during quiescence in the far uv . for the vast majority of dwarf novae",
    ", we do not know the accretion rate during quiescence , nor is the spectrum of the underlying white dwarf easily identifiable .",
    "among the key questions we seek to answer are : what is the accretion rate during quiescence ?",
    "is this rate of accretion consistent with the disk instability model ?",
    "how much flux does the white dwarf contribute to the fuv ?",
    "how much flux does the accretion disk contribute to the fuv ?",
    "how hot is the white dwarf ?    with these goals in mind , we expand our investigation of systems in quiescence , with the selection of the u gem - type dwarf novae , ey cygni .",
    "it exhibits a composition puzzle shared by only a few other non - magnetic and magnetic cvs .",
    "it is well - known that the most prominent and common emission line in the far uv spectra of dwarf novae is almost always civ ( 1548  , 1550  ) .",
    "ey cyg appears to be an exception to this rule because it has very strong nv emission and weak or absent civ , as first reported by winter & sion ( 2001 ) .",
    "further evidence of this was seen in a recent study conducted by gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , where examinations of hst / stis spectroscopic snapshots of both bz uma and ey cyg revealed both systems to have among the largest nv / civ ratios observed in cv systems .",
    "could the depleted carbon be pointing to a different thermonuclear history for these dwarf novae , related either to donor star contamination by nova ejecta from the accreting white dwarf ( see for example sion et al .",
    "1998 ) , or nucleosynthetic processing in a donor secondary originally more massive than the accreting white dwarf that underwent a short phase of thermal timescale mass transfer ( schenker et al.2002 ) ?",
    "is there any property of these two systems which points to the reason for the peculiar nv / civ emission line flux ratio ?",
    "the orbital period and recurrence time between outbursts of ey cygni has recently been re - determined ( echeverria et al . 2002 ; costero et al .",
    "the new orbital period is 0.45932 days ( compared with the previous value 0.2185 days reported by sarna et al .",
    "the recurrence time of its outbursts , based upon long term aavso archival light curve data , is 2000 days .",
    "its light curve is highly variable and very unusual in that it appears to be shifted by 0.5 phase relative to usual dwarf nova light curves with similar parameters .",
    "all of this prompted tovmassian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to obtain direct images of ey cyg in h@xmath6 to search for a nebulosity or common envelope . from the radial velocity study ( echeverria et al . 2002 ) and the light curve estimate ( tovmassian et al .",

    "they constrain @xmath7 to be in the range of 13 to 17 degrees .",
    "an integral part of our synthetic spectral analysis is to derive a distance fom the model fitting and compare it to estimated or derived distances to these systems as a consistency constraint on the goodness of fit .",
    "distances can be derived from the absolute magnitude at outburst ( m@xmath8 ) versus orbital period relation of warner ( 1995 ) .",
    "this yields 505 pc for ey cyg .",

    ", m@xmath8 = 5.92 - 0.383 @xmath9 ( hrs ) . however , for ey cyg , this relation yields 871 pc , which may be spurious due to ey cyg s period being far above the upper boundary of the period gap . a reasonable upper limit ( 700 pc ) to the distance of ey cyg is imposed by the fact that it is not embedded in the cygnus superbubble ( see below ) while a reasonable lower limit ( 250 - 300 pc ) is imposed from the spectral type of the secondary star . for ey cyg , tovmassian et al .",

    "this panel also shows the immediate surroundings of ey cyg after continuum substraction .",
    "the star is situated at the rim of a very circular ring of h@xmath6 emission .",
    "we checked the possibility of ey cyg having a proper motion that could move it to the center of that ring in a reasonable time stretch , but the position of the star does not change within the limits of the measurements in the past 50 years .",
    "it is very unlikely then that this ring is associated with our object .",
    "the other suspicious structure detected is in the form of a faint arc in the immediate surroundings of ey cyg , shown in fig 1b .",
    "it is not homogeneous .",
    "the size is about 25 arcsec .",
    "the lower limit of the distance to ey cyg from the secondary spectral class is at least 250 pc .",
    "the upper limit is probably 700 pc , otherwise the object would be embedded in the background cygnus superbubble and could hardly sustain its x - ray luminosity ( bochkarev & sitnik 1985 ) .",
    "therefore , a reasonable distance estimate to ey cyg would be around 400 - 500 pc ; this is also supported by the spectral class of the secondary . in this case , the arc would be comparable in size to the known nova shells of dq her and/or gk per .",
    "the morphology of this formation is a bit different from larger scale strips crossing the region .",
    "moreover , ey cyg is situated in the center of the arc , suggesting that it may be associated with the object .",
    "the images in sii show similar but much fainter structure around the star .",
    "we were not able to detect any emission in oiii from ey cyg or from the larger area .",
    "the arc in sii is only marginally seen , but its form coincides with that of the arc in h@xmath6 , which confirms its reality and suggests a possible association with ey cyg",
    ". however , we can not as yet definitively prove the association of the arc with the star .",
    "model spectra with solar abundances were created for high gravity stellar atmospheres using tlusty ( hubeny 1988 ) and synspec ( hubeny & lanz 1995 ) .",
    "we adopted model accretion disks from the optically thick disk model grid of wade & hubeny ( 1998 ) .",
    "using iuefit , a @xmath12 minimization routine , both @xmath12 values and a scale factor s were computed for each model .",
    "the scale factor , normalized to a kiloparsec , can be related to the white dwarf radius through : @xmath13 , where d is the distance to the source , h is the eddington ( surface ) flux and @xmath14 . for each system ,",
    "the best - fitting accretion disk model was combined with the best - fitting photosphere model to determine the contribution of both the accretion disk and the white dwarf .",
    "for this combined white dwarf plus disk model fitting , we took the best - fitting white dwarf model and combined it with the best - fitting disk model , but , in effect , modulated the accretion rate of the best - fitting disk model by multiplying the disk fluxes by a small numerical factor in the range 0.1 to 10.0 . in this relatively narrow range ,",
    "the scaling of the disk fluxes is roughly linear so the scaling approximates varying the accretion rate by a small increment and examining how it affects the @xmath12 value .",
    "we then found the best - fitting composite white dwarf plus disk model based upon the minimum @xmath12 value achieved and consistency of the scale factor - derived distance with the adopted distance for ey cyg .",
    "the overlap in wavelength between the fuse and stis spectrum is 1150a to 1182a .",
    "the flux levels between the two spectra are mismatched by a factor of 1.85 with the fuse spectrum having a higher flux level than the stis spectrum . in order to get the best match of the spectra in the overlap region",
    ", we raised the entire stis spectrum by a factor of 1.85 , but eliminated the overlap region in the stis spectrum and instead used the fuse overlap fluxes in that range since they are more reliable there .",
    "while we can not rule out that the mismatch is due to a stis calibration problem , we believe it is more likely that ey cyg was in a lower accretion state when the stis spectrum was taken .",
    "unfortunately , we have no optical observations which document brightness differences between the times of the stis and fuse spectra .",
    "if we had divided the fuse fluxes by 1.85 to match the lower stis fluxes , then a lower temperature from the overall fit would have resulted .",
    "hence , the temperature we have derived from raising all of the stis fluxes to match the fuse fluxes in the overlap range can be regarded as an upper limit .    for ey cygni",
    ", we constructed a grid of white dwarf models with fixed surface gravity log @xmath3 , t@xmath15 , si and c abundance 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 5.0 and v@xmath16 .",
    "for the all of the accretion disk fitting , we adopted m@xmath17 and @xmath18 degrees in order to be consistent with the published values and with the white dwarf gravity in the photosphere fits .",
    "for the accretion belt fitting , taking @xmath19 km / s .",
    "this high velocity region is rotating near the keplerian velocity , much faster than the white dwarf rotation velocity of 400 km / s .",
    "however , the high velocity region covers a relatively smaller fraction of the white dwarf surface area and may , in reality , lie above the surface ( e.g. a hot rotating ring ) rather than being right at the photosphere . for the belt",
    ", we took log @xmath20 and solar abundances for all elements .",
    "we tried a range of accretion belt temperatures t@xmath21 in steps of 1 .",
    "the results of our fitting of a single temperature white dwarf to ey cyg are somwhat encouraging in that the best - fitting model ( i.e. , least @xmath22 ) yielded a lower distance ( 301 pc ) than our adopted distance of 450 pc but not unreasonably lower .",
    "we find that the if the fuse + stis spectrum is due to the white dwarf alone , then t@xmath23k , log @xmath1 , v sin i = 600 km / s with si abundance = 0.1 x solar and c = 0.2 x solar .",
    "even though the fitting yielded a rotational velocity , this value must be viewed with caution due to the lack of well - defined line profiles in the spectra . since",
    "the fuse and stis spectra were mismatched by a factor of 1.85 in the overlap region , the temperature we have derived should be considered an upper limit ( see above ) .",

    "however , the scale factor of the disk fit yielded a distance = 1.8 kpc !",
    "the disk model plus white dwarf giving the minimum @xmath12 value was exactly the accretion rate derived from the lone accretion disk fit . in the combined fit ,",
    "the accretion disk accounted for 96% of the fuv flux while the white dwarf accounted for 8% of the fuv flux .",
    "however , the distance derived from the scale factor of the combined fit was 1,060 pc , substantially larger than than our adopted most probable distance of 450 pc .    finally , we attempted fits involving two - temperature white dwarfs , in which a hotter , rapidly spinning region of small surface area ( e.g. , an accretion belt ) is combined with a white dwarf rotating more slowly with a lower temperature .",
    "we also constructed accretion belt models with log @xmath29 , v@xmath30 km / s , t@xmath31 . the best - fitting white dwarf plus belt model yielded the lowest @xmath12 value ( 2.03 ) of all of the above single and two - component fitting experiments and a distance = 351 pc , within a 100 pc of the adopted distance of 450 pc .",

    "based upon the fitting experiments described in the preceding section , it seems clear that the fuse plus stis spectrum of ey cygni in quiescence is best - represented by either a single temperature white dwarf with t@xmath37k or by a white dwarf with t@xmath2k and an accretion belt having t@xmath4k and v@xmath32 sin @xmath33 km / s .",
    "since the latter fit has a lower @xmath12 and yields a distance closer to 450pc , it is favored over the single temperature white dwarf fit .",
    "the accretion belt is the dominant source of fuv flux from the fuse range through the stis range with the cooler white dwarf latitudes contributing less than 40% of the fuv flux .    in ey cygni , which lies above the period gap",
    ", the @xmath38 value appears to be lower than the typical 29,000 to 35,000k of other u gem and z cam systems above the gap .",
    "could there be any connection between the high mass white dwarf , lower t@xmath24 of ey cygni and the abundance anomaly seen in the far - uv spectra ? with a higher white dwarf mass and lower @xmath38 value ,",
    "it is possible that the abundance anomaly ( excess n , depleted c ) may be associated with a greater system age ( longer cooling time of the white dwarf ) than other dwarf novae . if indeed the white dwarf core has cooled for a longer timescale , then the equilibrium @xmath38 value in response to accretion is expected to be lower .",
    "this might suggest that an older system age and massive white dwarf allows for more classical novae episodes , hence more cno nucleosynthetic processing , consequently more contamination of the secondary s atmosphere during the brief common envelope stage of each nova .",
    "such systems may be more likely to exhibit the apparent excess n and depleted c associated with cno processing .",
    "our direct images with a narrow h@xmath6 filter of ey cyg and its surroundings show the nova - like appearing envelope around it , but were inconclusive as to whether the nebular emission around the object is associated with it .",
    "an alternative , more promising picture has emerged however .",
    "recent work by gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that the n / c anomaly seen in the dwarf novae bz uma , ey cyg , 1rxs j232953.9 + 062814 , and now ch uma ( see dulude & sion 2002 ) , may have its origin in a cv with an originally more massive donor star ( @xmath39 ) which survived thermal time scale mass transfer ( schenker et al .",
