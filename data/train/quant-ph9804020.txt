    "recently , the properties of open quantum systems have been studied with a renewed interest in the framework of different approaches .",
    "mostly discussed is the restructuring of the systems taking place at high level density under critical conditions and the resulting formation of different time scales in terms of lifetimes of resonance states .",
    "the reorganization occurs if the degree @xmath9 of overlapping reaches a critical value ( @xmath10 is the average width obtained by averaging over _ all _ @xmath11 resonance states in a certain energy region and @xmath12 is the mean level distance ) .",
    "it is investigated for resonance phenomena in nuclei @xcite , atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite . in the meantime",
    "it has been considered also in other systems such as e.g. quantum dots @xcite and microwave billards @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath11 of resonance states is usually much larger than the number @xmath13 of open decay channels . +",
    "a powerful method in describing the properties of an open quantum system is the projection operator technique .",
    "it allows us to investigate , in a direct manner , the corrections to the many - particle states in a subspace of the full hilbert space which arise from the coupling to the orthogonal subspace .",
    "originally the idea of using the projection operator technique arose in nuclear physics .",
    "the influence of discrete states as well as closed decay channels ( @xmath14 subspace ) onto the wavefunctions of the open decay channels ( @xmath15 subspace ) is considered in the feshbach unified theory of nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological model describes well the properties of nuclei at an excitation energy of about 10 mev by employing statistical assumptions on the states of the @xmath16 subspace .",
    "in contrast to this , the ground and low - lying states of nuclei are described well by the wavefunctions of the discrete states ( @xmath16 subspace ) , considering the influence of the decay channels ( @xmath17 subspace ) in an approximated manner .",
    "+ the properties of an _ open _ quantum system are described well by using the latter division of the whole function space : the @xmath16 subspace contains the discrete states of the system while the @xmath17 subspace consists of open as well as closed decay channels @xcite . in studying the restructuring ,",
    "we are interested in the properties of the states of the @xmath16 subspace modified by their coupling to the @xmath17 subspace playing the role of an environment .",
    "this method can be used for a wide class of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "+ the question whether this restructuring may be considered as a phase transition of second order is put in @xcite but not considered in detail up to now . a possible analogy to the formation of laser light is investigated numerically in @xcite . as in the case of the laser , a control parameter @xmath0 can be defined which is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "the information entropy changes rapidly in a relatively small region of the control parameter in both the laser @xcite and the open quantum system @xcite .",
    "+ in other investigations @xcite it was realized that the avoided crossing of two neighbouring resonance states which are coupled to one common channel is the basic process of the restructuring observed globally in the system .",
    "as soon as two resonances start to overlap each other , their interaction via the continuum can no longer be neglected . as a function of the coupling to a certain decay channel",
    "the two resonances approach each other in energy up to a certain minimum distance in the complex energy plane at @xmath19 . the avoided crossing is reflected in the wavefunctions of the two resonance states .",
    "the biorthogonality reaches its maximum if @xmath20 , and vanishes if @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite . as a function of further increasing @xmath23 ,",
    "the width of one of the two resonance states decreases ( resonance trapping ) while the width of the other one increases further .",
    "+ the local resonance trapping can explain , indeed , the global restructuring of the quantum system under critical conditions .",
    "it determines also , as will be shown in this paper , whether the restructuring of the system takes place collectively with the simultaneous participation of _ all _ basis states or successively by individual trapping of resonance states .",
    "+ in the following , we will investigate this question in detail . in sect .  2",
    ", we write down the basic equations used in the paper .",
    "the model is formulated and the characteristic polynomial is given .",
    "the hamiltonian is non - hermitian and its eigenfunctions are , generally , bi - orthogonal . in section 3 , the properties of a system with picket - fence distributed levels coupled with the same strength to one decay channel",
    "is investigated in detail .",
    "the study is performed analytically for the limiting case of an infinite number of states as well as for a finite number .",
    "the results are illustrated by numerical calculations .",
    "finally , the results obtained are discussed and identified with characteristic features of a second - order phase transition .",
    "the process of formation of a collective state aligned with the decay channel is discussed in detail .",
    "its wavefunction is coherently mixed in the wavefunctions of all basis states including those states which are _ not _ overlapped by it . + the results obtained in section 3 are underpinned in section 4 by considering some other level and coupling - strength distributions being more realistic than those in section 3 .",
    "the study is performed both analytically and numerically .",
    "general conditions for the appearance of a second - order phase transition are formulated analytically and illustrated by the results of numerical calculations .",
    "as a special case , the sharpness of a phase transition is shown to be distorted by an imaginary part in the coupling term .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in the last section .",
    "let us consider the hamilton operator @xmath24 of a many - particle system where @xmath25 describes the mean - field , i.e. the motion of the particles in a finite depth potential and @xmath26 is the operator of the two - particle residual interaction .",
    "a convenient method to solve the schrdinger equation @xmath27 in the full hilbert space of discrete and continuous states is to use the projection operator technique introduced by feshbach @xcite . here",
    "the whole function space is divided into two subspaces by using the projection operators @xmath28 with @xmath29 , where @xmath16 contains the many - particle discrete states @xmath30 being solutions of @xmath31 , and @xmath17 the many - particle scattering states @xmath32 being solutions of @xmath33 .",
    "the total hamiltonian acting on the full hilbertspace is split into four terms : @xmath34 .",
    "+ we are interested in the properties of the hamiltonian of the open quantum system , which acts on the @xmath16 subspace _ and _ carries the influence of the @xmath17 space . the derivation of this hamilton operator can be found in @xcite , @xmath35 it consists of two terms .",
    "the first one ( @xmath36 ) describes the behaviour of the closed system of discrete states which includes the configurational mixing due to the two body residual interaction , but does not take into account the coupling to the decay channels .",
    "the second term gives the correction due to the coupling of the two subspaces and contains the propagator in the @xmath17-subspace @xmath37^{-1}\\hat p$ ] .",
    "+ due to this propagator the effective hamiltonian is energy dependent and non - hermitian .",
    "its complex eigenvalues @xmath38 give the poles of the resonance part of the scattering matrix @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the transition matrix element between a bound and a scattering state .",
    "thereby , the complex eigenvalues @xmath41 get a concrete physical interpretation as the energy positions @xmath42 and total decay widths @xmath43 of a resonance state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44 differ usually from the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath45 of @xmath46 , i.e. from the energies of the states of the unperturbed system .",
    "so the external coupling to the decay channels causes not only the finite lifetime of the states but generally also an energy shift .",
    "+ in the following , we will restrict ourselves to an energy region in which the energy dependence of the hamiltonian is small in spite of a large number @xmath11 of states lying in it .",
    "further , we consider a small number @xmath13 of decay channels which are all open and not coupled among themselves .",
    "then , the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath47 ) in the @xmath16 subspace is , to a good approximation , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a hermitian operator if we consider time reversal invariance . as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham0 ] ) the first term @xmath50 describes the internal structure of the unperturbed system in the @xmath16 subspace .",
    "the second term @xmath51 follows from @xmath52 and describes the coupling between the two subspaces .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 , assumed mostly to be real , characterizes the mean coupling strength between discrete and continuous states .",
    "+ the hamiltonian ( @xmath53 ) is used successfully for the description of resonance states in nuclei @xcite and molecules @xcite .",
    "nowadays , it is applied also to the description of resonance phenomena in other systems such as e.g. quantum dots @xcite and microwave billards @xcite .",
    "+ the rank of @xmath50 is equal to the number @xmath11 of states considered .",
    "its non - diagonal matrix elements describe the configurational mixing of the discrete states .",
    "the coupling matrix @xmath54 is a @xmath55 matrix if the number of open decay channels is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "the element @xmath56 of @xmath54 describes the coupling of the discrete state @xmath57 to the channel @xmath58 ; @xmath59 . thus",
    ", the rank of @xmath60 is @xmath13 . +",
    "as long as @xmath0 is small , the second term of the hamiltonian @xmath61 can be considered as a small perturbation of @xmath50 .",
    "this condition is always fulfilled if the average width @xmath62 is much smaller than the average distance @xmath12 between neighbouring resonance states . in this case ,",
    "the non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath61 are small , the individual resonances are isolated .",
    "their positions and widths obtained from the eigenvalues @xmath63 of @xmath61 differ only slightly from the real and imaginary parts , respectively , of the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath61 .",
    "+ in the opposite case of large @xmath0 , the matrix @xmath60 determines the behaviour of the system .",
    "then , the rank of @xmath61 is given by @xmath13 .",
    "that means , @xmath64 states are almost decoupled from the continuum of decay channels and become long lived ( trapped ) while @xmath13 states take almost the whole coupling strength : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , two different time scales arise at large @xmath0 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "+ thus , a reorganization in the open quantum system takes place in the transition from small coupling parameters @xmath0 to large ones when @xmath67 . in the following",
    ", we will investigate the question whether and under which conditions the reorganisation of the open quantum system can be understood as a phase transition in the limit @xmath68 .",

    "this means , the singularity in the widths of the resonances , obtained for @xmath421 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cpri ] ) vanishes when @xmath420 .",
    "+ this result can be understood as follows . in @xcite the distribution of exceptional points",
    "is investigated for systems described by a hamiltonian of the type @xmath426 .",
    "the exceptional points of such a system are those points in the parameter space of @xmath427 at which two ( or more ) eigenvalues coincide ( for a more detailed discussion see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath427 can be a real , imaginary or , more generally , a complex number .",
    "the distribution of the exceptional points is determined by the matrices @xmath428 and @xmath429 .",
    "it is independent of the value of @xmath427 which determines , for its part , the positions of the ( in general complex ) eigenvalues of @xmath430 . in the one - channel case ( in which @xmath429 has rank one ) ,",
    "there exist @xmath431 exceptional points corresponding to the crossing of the collective state with each of the other @xmath431 states .",
    "+ for systems which show a phase transition , _ all _ @xmath431 exceptional points converge to the finite _ purely real _ value of @xmath432 in the limit @xmath294 . for finite systems ,",
    "almost all exceptional points are near to this accumulation point .",
    "this result holds not only for the ideal picket fence , but for _ all _ systems , which suffer a phase transition @xcite .",
    "+ for the systems investigated in the present paper it follows .",
    "the accumulation point being determined by the matrices @xmath428 and @xmath433 , is _ independent _ of the coupling parameter @xmath0 . when the system with a purely imaginary coupling ( i.e. @xmath434 ) shows a phase transition , _ all _ @xmath435 exceptional points are met if @xmath0 approaches the critical value .",
    "the collective mode repels with all the other ones simultaniously , i.e.  all states run through their exceptional point at @xmath235 .",
    "this means all @xmath431 exceptional points are accumulated at @xmath178 . in that case",
    ", @xmath436 diverges for all @xmath57 simultaneously in the limes @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the dimension of the eigenspace collapses from @xmath197 to 1 @xmath437 if @xmath0 hits the accumulation point . therefore , also @xmath337 diverges at @xmath178 .",
    "if the coupling parameter is complex ( @xmath438 ) , however , the system passes the accumulation point in a certain distance in the complex @xmath439-plane . as a result",
    ", the singularity at @xmath178 will be avoided . for @xmath440 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath337 does not diverge if @xmath68 but reaches a certain maximum value . refering to this result ,",
    "we claim that , according to a rigorous mathematical definition , the phase transition will be destroyed by any given nonvanishing real part @xmath441 in the coupling parameter ( a detailed discussion of this aspect is given in @xcite ) .",
    "+ let us illustrate this result by means of a numerical study .",
    "to that purpose , we replace @xmath0 by @xmath442 .",
    "we choose @xmath443 , as usually , and perform the calculations for @xmath444 by varying @xmath0 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath50 ( for @xmath421 ) and the coupling matrix elements are chosen to be @xmath180 and @xmath445 , respectively . in fig .  8.a .",
    "we have drawn the number of principal components of the collective resonance state as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "+ the numerical results show a clear difference between the cases with small and large angle @xmath446 .",
    "the larger @xmath446 , the less is the number of basis states contributing to the collective state at a given @xmath23 .",
    "further , the curves rise up more smoothly when @xmath446 is larger . for large angles the maximum value @xmath390",
    "is not reached at the maximum value @xmath447 shown in the figure .",
    "thus , in the case of the finite spectrum studied numerically , the reorganisation process is getting smoother the larger @xmath446 .",
    "in other words , the reorganisation process is washed out , if the system can not hit the accumulation point of the exceptional points , but has to pass it in a certain distance in the complex parameter space . + this conclusion is underlined by the results given in fig  8.b .",
    "here we have fixed the angle @xmath446 to @xmath448 and varied the number of states included in the spectrum ( @xmath285 and @xmath388 states ) .",
    "as one can see , the characteristic features of the curves are not changed by changing the number of basis states .",
    "the transition remains smooth also for @xmath449 states over the whole range of @xmath0 .",
    "so , these systems can not be characterized by a critical point .",
    "we see a critical region of @xmath0 , which will be the larger , the larger the nearest distance between the accumulation point and the eigenvalues in the complex plane is .",
    "the analytical and numerical investigations represented in the foregoing sections point to similarities and differences in the behaviour of the different systems under the influence of varying strength of the coupling to the continuum ( decay channel ) . in any case , a restructuring in the system takes place ( or starts to take place ) when the coupling parameter @xmath0 is large enough . a collective state",
    "which is aligned with the decay channel is formed in the centre of the spectrum .",
    "its wavefunction is coherently mixed in the set of basis wavefunctions of the corresponding closed system .",
    "the trapped states have incoherently mixed wavefunctions . beyond a certain value of the control parameter @xmath0 ,",
    "two different time scales exist ( _ bifurcation of the widths _ ) .",
    "+ in some cases , the restructuring in the system can be identified as a second - order phase transition .",
    "the separation of different time scales occurs suddenly at a critical value @xmath178 and is a collective effect of the _ whole _ spectrum .",
    "the order parameter @xmath450 increases linearily as a function of the control parameter @xmath0 with a universal slope one , as soon as the control parameter is larger than its critical value .",
    "in other cases , the separation of time scales occurs successively by individual trapping of neighbouring resonance states . in that case",
    ", the collectivity is restricted by the extension of the energy region , overlapped by the fast decaying resonance state .",
    "the process of reorganisation continues up to @xmath22 .",
    "+ the differences in the behaviour of systems which show a phase transition to those which do not , can be seen nicely in the example of the ideal picket fence . in the case with equally distributed levels coupled with the same strength to one common channel ,",
    "all states are equivalent .",
    "consequently , the direction of the energy shift accompanying the local resonance trapping is undefined and the local resonance trapping is hindered .",
    "the redistribution of the system under the influence of the decay channel can take place only collectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath335 rises linearly in @xmath23 with slope 1 . + more realistic systems show a phase transition when the energy dependence of the level density is compensated by an energy dependence of the coupling strength . for example",
    ", a dilution of the level density can be compensated by a corresponding enhancement of the coupling strength .",
    "the critical value @xmath178 is well determined .",
    "further when the system is bounded from below , a phase transition occurs under the same conditions as for non - bounded systems .",
    "it occurs at the same critical value @xmath451 .",
    "+ moreover we could show , that the conditions for a phase transition do not have to be fulfilled strictly , but only on the average .",
    "small irregularities in the energy dependence of the levels or in the distribution of the coupling vectors are washed out , if the number of states in the spectrum is sufficiently high . also",
    "the generic case of goe - distributed states shows the features of a phase transition even for a comparably small number of states .",
    "the fast decaying state is created by _ all _ states of the spectrum , independently of whether they are overlapped by it or not .",
    "+ another characteristic feature of the phase transition is the mixing of the wavefunctions . in the case of the ideal picket fence ,",
    "it changes suddenly at @xmath178 from its minimum value @xmath452 to the maximum value @xmath390 for the state @xmath453 .",
    "the width of the collective resonance state at @xmath235 is of the order of @xmath254 whereas the extension of the spectrum is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "also in the more general case , where the energy dependence of the level density is compensated by the coupling strength of the resonance states , we could prove , that the width of the collective state is much smaller than the extension of the spectrum for couplings close to the critical point .",
    "nevertheless , the collective state carries contributions of ( almost ) _ all _ basis states even if they are , in the case of a finite spectrum , close to the borders . when @xmath454 , the value of @xmath251 is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this holds also if the system is disturbed by random pertubations , where the compensation conditions are fulfiled only on the average .",
    "+ the situation is different if the energy dependence of the level density is not compensated by the energy dependence of the coupling vector .",
    "in such a case , the local resonance trapping between neighbouring states is not hindered but occurs successively starting in the region with the largest level density or coupling strength .",
    "if the level density is larger in the centre of the spectrum than at other energies and the coupling strength to the channel is the same for all levels , the collective mode is created only locally for any finite value of @xmath0 .",
    "this local collective state traps successively more and more resonance states in direction to the border of the spectrum . this process of local resonance trapping with increasing width of one state in the centre continues endlessly up to @xmath22 ( in the limit @xmath68 ) .",
    "although the short - lived state has collective properties it is not created by all basis states of the spectrum but only by those which are overlapped by it .",
    "there is no phase transition at all .",
    "+ the resonance structure of the system is , in the cases considered , symmetrical in relation to the critical value @xmath178 of the control parameter although the number of long - lived resonance states for @xmath336 and for @xmath23 differs by 1 . as an example",
    ", the picket - fence distribution with level distance @xmath455 and equal coupling strength to the continuum remains a picket - fence distribution also at @xmath23 but is shifted in energy by 1/2 of the level distance .",
    "+ for finite @xmath11 , collective states may be caused also by an additional real part to the hamiltonian , e.g. @xmath456 , leaving @xmath457 hermitian .",
    "it is called internal collectivity in contrast to the external collectivity discussed above . in such a case ,",
    "the process of reorganization in the system occurs smoothly .",
    "a phase transition does not take place .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath457 are orthogonal in the usual manner : @xmath458 for all @xmath57 and @xmath0 .",
    "+ also the non - hermiticity of the hamiltonian @xmath61 is , however , not sufficient for the appearance of a phase transition , as the results presented in the foregoing sections show . in any case ,",
    "the value @xmath337 characterizing the bi - orthogonality of the set of eigenfunctions of @xmath61 plays a decisive role . only when it becomes essentially , i.e. when @xmath459 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonher4 ] ) ) at a certain well - defined value of @xmath0 , a phase transition takes place .",
    "when , however , the reordering of the system takes place successively in a limited region of the spectrum with @xmath460 states , then @xmath461 but @xmath337 is close to 1 . in this case , the reorganisation in the system does not occur collectively but smoothly as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "+ as a result , in the case of a phase transition the bi - orthogonality of _ all _ the eigenfunctions of @xmath61 is maximal at ( almost ) the same value of @xmath0 and , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonher4 ] ) , @xmath459 at @xmath178 . for illustration",
    "we show in fig .",
    "9 the value of @xmath337 as a function of @xmath0 for four different cases .",
    "the theoretical value of @xmath178 is marked by a vertical solid line . only in the case without phase transition , this sum is always very close to 1 while it has a clearly expressed maximum at the critical point @xmath178 whenever a phase transition occurs .",
    "further , the eigenfunctions of @xmath61 are orthogonal in the usual manner for @xmath462 as well as for @xmath463 . here , @xmath464 .",
    "+ this result can nicely be illustrated by means of the exceptional points defined as the crossing points of resonance states .",
    "they are determined by the structure of the different parts of the effective hamiltonian ( see sect .",
    "4.4 ) but are independent of the coupling parameter . in the one - channel case considered by us , they accumulate at one point in the limit @xmath68 . in the case",
    "the system shows a phase transition , the eigenvalues meet this accumulation point when considered as a function of the coupling parameter and @xmath465 in its neighbourhood .",
    "+ therefore , we may differentiate between four situations : ( i ) the exceptional points accumulate at a finite real value in the complex @xmath466-plane _ and _ the system goes through the accumulation point , ( ii ) the exceptional points accumulate at a finite real value in the complex @xmath466-plane but the phase @xmath446 of the coupling hinders the system to hit the accumulation point , ( iii ) the exceptional points accumulate at @xmath467 , ( iv ) the exceptional points do not accumulate at all but they are spread over the whole complex @xmath466-plane with diverging absolute value of the coupling parameter .",
    "examples are ( i ) the compensated case , ( ii ) the system with complex coupling , ( iii ) the overcompensated case , ( iv ) the undercompensated case ( for details see @xcite ) . + the stochastic processes described by the ( complex ) partial widths are much larger for @xmath468 than at other values of @xmath0 .",
    "this is expressed by the relation @xmath469 where @xmath470 is the partial width of the state @xmath57 in relation to the ( only ) decay channel @xmath58 @xcite . since @xmath471 near @xmath178 , it follows @xmath472 for @xmath468 . the structure observed in the cross section is determined by the @xmath473-matrix , eq .",
    "( [ eq : smat ] ) .",
    "it depends essentially , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : smat ] ) , on the length of the spectrum ( i.e on the values @xmath470 of all the states ) , but not on the width @xmath328 of the collective state . for illustration , @xmath474 is shown in fig .",
    "10 for three different values of @xmath475 .",
    "the width of the collective state is @xmath476 and @xmath477 , respectively , for the three values of @xmath225 considered .",
    "the width @xmath478 has almost nothing in common with the structure observed in the cross section as one easily sees from the figure .",
    "+ the same result follows also from our analytical considerations . at the critical point , the sum of the widths of all states is smaller than the total length @xmath70 of the spectrum by a factor @xmath479 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : summenf ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the width of the broadest state ( in the centre of the spectrum ) is in the order of @xmath480 in the ideal picket - fence model . in the limit of large @xmath197 it is in general tiny compared to the length of the spectrum according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : broadm ] ) .",
    "this shows , that the transition is caused by the cooperative behaviour of all states .",
    "it is _ not _ caused by the overlap of the complete spectrum by one of the states . in the cross section , we see a structure of the extension of the length of the spectrum since _ all _ states are coupled to the decay channel .",
    "the width of the broadest state is much smaller than this structure .",
    "+ the numerical results show further that the number @xmath11 of states need not necessarily be infinite in deciding the question whether the transition is of second order or not .",
    "the second - order phase transition is well expressed already for a relatively small number of states ( @xmath481 up to @xmath482 in our calculations ) in all cases in which the analytical study shows a phase transition in the limit @xmath68 .",
    "+ in our analytical and numerical studies the limiting case @xmath68 is achieved by an extension of the length of the spectrum .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the results are the same if , instead , the length of the spectrum is kept fixed at some finite value and the level density approaches @xmath483 with @xmath68 .",
    "+ in many - particle systems , the level density depends on energy . in nuclei",
    ", it increases exponentially with energy .",
    "the coupling strength of the states to the continuum decreases , however , with energy due to the increasing contribution of many - particle many - hole configurations to the wavefunctions of the states (  compound nucleus states  ) .",
    "it is an interesting question whether in such a system the increasing level density is  compensated  in a certain energy range of the spectrum by the decreasing mean coupling strength so that the condition for a second - order phase transition is fulfilled .",
