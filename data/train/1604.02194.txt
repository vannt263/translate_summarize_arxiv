    "complex irregular behavior is a characteristic of chaotic systems , which is usually visualized through the time series of an observable .",
    "many natural and engineering systems exhibit a second level of complexity typified by rare extreme bursts in the time series of certain observables .",
    "they are rare in the sense that they are short - lived and the frequency at which they occur is significantly smaller than the typical frequency of the time series ; and they are extreme in the sense that they correspond to the values of the observable that are several standard deviations away from its mean value .",
    "examples of such rare , extreme phenomena in nature include oceanic rogue waves  @xcite , intermittent fluctuations in turbulent models  @xcite and extreme events in climate dynamics  @xcite .",
    "while the prediction of extreme events is of utmost importance , our dim understanding of their origins and precursors has impeded our ability to predict them .",
    "a promising approach is to predict the rare events directly from the time series of the observable .",
    "if the system has a compact , finite - dimensional attractor , the dynamics can in principle be reconstructed from the observations by delay - coordinate embedding techniques  @xcite , or linear and/or nonlinear order reduction methods  @xcite . however",
    ", for high - dimensional chaotic attractors the reconstructed dynamics have a poor forecasting skill ( see e.g.  @xcite ) which is comparable with mean square models ( models based on carefully tuned langevin equations @xcite ) .",
    "since rare extreme events are associated with strong nonlinearities and intermittently positive lyapunov exponents ( i.e. , high sensitivity to perturbations ) , their prediction from a finite set of observations is challenging and remains an active area of research ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a more physically illuminating approach comes from multiscale analysis , where a dynamical system model is decomposed into slow and fast variables  @xcite or stable and unstable manifolds  @xcite .",
    "the bursting mechanism in these models is rather well - understood  @xcite .",
    "for the most part , the dynamics takes place on the slow manifold .",
    "the slow dynamics may be chaotic , but no bursting event occurs on the slow manifold itself .",
    "the bursts occur along the unstable manifold ( of the slow manifold ) and correspond to the growth of the fast variables .",
    "the unstable manifold is typically homoclinic to the slow manifold such that the flow returns eventually to the slow manifold  @xcite .",
    "this cycle can repeat indefinitely and , if the slow dynamics is chaotic , irregularly ( see figure  [ fig : schem_bursting ] , for an illustration ) .",
    "while this geometric approach is certainly illuminating , it is of little applicability to complex systems , since a clear separation of time scales is often not available in realistic models ( e.g. , navier  stokes equations ) . nor does there exist a general recipe to transform the coordinates into slow and fast variables  @xcite .",
    "this becomes particularly prohibitive in high dimensional systems .",
    "here , we introduce a diagnostic indicator for the prediction of rare extreme events in high dimensional systems .",
    "the indicator is based on the aforementioned observations on the multiscale systems but does not require a priori known fast - slow coordinates . more precisely we show that a small number of optimally time - dependent ( otd ) modes @xcite , obtained through a minimization principle and the history of the system state up to the current time instant , allows for the description of the currently most unstable subspace in a dynamically consistent fashion . we show that the linearized dynamics projected in this optimal , time - dependent subspace , can predict an upcoming rare extreme event .",
    "we note that simply computing the eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics is costly and , in many cases , the results are completely oblivious to transient instabilities ( e.g. instabilities associated with non - normal dynamics , @xcite ) .    in section  [ sec : prelim ] , we review the otd modes and introduce our indicator .",
    "we demonstrate the application of the indicator on three examples : a low dimensional prototype system ( section  [ sec : bursting ] ) , a body forced navier  stokes equation ( section  [ sec : kolm ] ) and a modified nonlinear schrdinger equation as a model for unidirectional water waves ( section  [ sec : mnls ] ) .",
