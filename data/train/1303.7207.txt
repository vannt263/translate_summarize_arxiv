    "the correlation energy is a central quantity in quantum chemistry .",
    "it is usually defined as the error in the electronic energy calculated within the independent - particle model of hartree  fock ( hf ) theory with respect to the exact solution of the electronic schrdinger equation @xcite , @xmath4 the exact electronic energy @xmath5 can be obtained from the full configuration interaction ( fci ) approach .    although there exists no rigorous distinction between different types of electron correlation effects , the correlation energy is typically divided into three categories : _ dynamic _ , _ static _ and _ nondynamic _ @xcite . the dynamic correlation energy is considered to be responsible for keeping electrons apart and is attributed to a large number of configurations ( determinants ) with small absolute weights in the wave function expansion , while the nondynamic and static contributions involve only some determinants with large absolute weights which are necessary for an appropriate treatment of the quasi - degeneracy of orbitals @xcite . in particular , static electron correlation embraces a suitable combination of determinants to account for proper spin symmetries and their interactions , whereas nondynamic correlation is required to allow a molecule to separate correctly into its fragments @xcite .    over the past decades",
    ", a number of quantum chemical methods has been developed to accurately describe either dynamic or nondynamic / static correlation effects .",
    "for instance , mller ",
    "plesset perturbation theory and single - reference coupled cluster ( cc ) theory @xcite are successful in capturing dynamic correlation effects in single - reference cases , while the complete active space self consistent field ( casscf ) approach @xcite is suitable to describe static correlation in multi - reference problems .",
    "still , the neglect of one kind of correlation effects may lead to non - negligible errors , which led to the development of `` hybrid '' approaches , among which are the complete active space second - order perturbation theory ( caspt2 ) @xcite and the multi - reference cc ansatz @xcite , both with their own intrinsic limitations . _ a priori _ knowledge about the interplay of dynamic , nondynamic and static electron correlation effects is required to select an appropriate electron correlation method in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "this issue becomes most severe when spectroscopic accuracy of , say , 0.01 ev for relative energies is desired .",
    "the consideration of dynamic , static and nondynamic correlation effects on an equal footing still remains a challenge for quantum chemistry .",
    "the quality of single- and multi - reference quantum chemical methods can be estimated by a number of diagnostic tools @xcite .",
    "examples are the absolute or squared weights of the reference or principal configuration ( the @xmath6 coefficient ) obtained from a ci calculation @xcite and the euclidean norm of the @xmath7 amplitudes , which are denoted as @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 diagnostics @xcite in cc and perturbation theory , respectively . related",
    "are the @xmath10 and @xmath11 measures based on single and double excitations in single - reference cc theory  @xcite .",
    "a conceptually different group of diagnostic measures is based on concepts from quantum information theory and exploits knowledge about the one - particle reduced density matrix in terms of natural occupation numbers @xcite , the two - particle reduced density matrix or its cumulant in terms of the frobenius norm @xcite , the weights from excited configurations of some wave function expansion , @xcite and the distribution of effectively unpaired electrons @xcite .",
    "a complementary classification of electron correlation effects that exploits entanglement measures among molecular orbitals was recently proposed by us @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the assessment of the entanglement among any pair of orbitals and the entanglement of one orbital with all other orbitals , respectively , as encoded in a fci - type wave function .",
    "an in - depth study of iron nitrosyl complexes @xcite , featuring complicated electronic structures , showed that the static , nondynamic , and dynamic contributions to the correlation energy and , as a consequence , the single- and multi - reference nature of a quantum system , can be distinguished by examining the entanglement patterns of the orbitals .",
    "our entanglement analysis comprises two entropic measures : ( i ) the single - orbital entropy@xcite , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 denotes the four different occupations of a spatial orbital ) which quantifies the entanglement between one particular orbital and the remaining set of orbitals contained in the active orbital space from the eigenvalues @xmath14 of the one - orbital reduced density matrix @xmath15 of a given orbital . and , ( ii ) the mutual information@xcite , @xmath16 which measures the entanglement of two orbitals @xmath17 and @xmath18 embedded in the environment of all other active - space orbitals .",
    "@xmath19 is the two - orbital entropy between a pair @xmath20 of orbitals , which is calculated from the eigenvalue of the two - orbital reduced density matrix @xmath21 ( analogously to eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1 ] ) , but with @xmath13 now enumerating the 16 possible no- , one- , and two - electron states defined on the pair of orbitals ) , and @xmath22 is the kronecker delta . the one- and two - orbital density matrices can be determined from a many - particle density matrix by tracing out all many - electron states defined on the active - space orbitals that complement those orbital @xmath17 ( and @xmath18 , respectively ) whose entanglement with the others shall be studied @xcite . the general occupation - number - vector expansion of the electronic wave function constructed from @xmath23 active - space orbitals @xmath24 denoting the occupation of orbital @xmath17 )",
    "may be decomposed into states @xmath25 and @xmath26 defined on a system comprising the single or pair of orbitals , respectively , and into those of its environment defined on the remaining orbitals . if , for the system consisting of one orbital @xmath17 , we split the environment states @xmath27",
    "( @xmath27 then being a composite index ) as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we can write the total electronic state as @xmath30 for the case of the system consisting of two orbitals @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we may split the environment states @xmath27 as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33",
    ". then , the total electronic state reads in this basis @xmath34 the one- and two - orbital density matrix operator can now be expressed as @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . from these operators",
    "one may derive the one- and two - orbital density matrices , which are calculated from the expansion coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the total quantum information embedded in a wave function can be calculated from the set of single - orbital entropies @xcite @xmath39 as found in ref .  ,",
    "large single - orbital entropies ( @xmath40 ) and large values for the mutual information @xmath41 indicate orbitals which are important for nondynamic correlation effects .",
    "medium - sized single - orbital entropies ( @xmath42 ) together with moderately entangled orbitals ( medium values of @xmath41 ) and small single - orbital entropies ( @xmath43 ) accompanied by small values of @xmath41 can be attributed to static and dynamic correlation effects , respectively .",
    "an advantage of our approach is that it reduces electron correlation effects encoded in a wave function ( optimized by any quantum chemical method ) to quantities defined for the orbital basis , which can then be easily compared to each other .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , it provides a computational prescription for the calculation of the entanglement measures introduced in refs . and exploited in ref .  , which is given in section [ sec :",
    "second , these entanglement measures are discussed in the context of bond - forming ( or equivalently , bond - breaking ) processes in section [ sec : bond ] ( section [ comput_det ] contains the computational details ) , where we demonstrate how the single - orbital entropy can be employed to monitor the cleavage of chemical bonds .",
    "conceptual understanding of electronic structures in terms of entangled orbitals results and a pictorial representation of how many bonds ( single , double , triple , etc . ) are formed between two atoms emerges from the single - orbital entropy diagrams .",
    "we focus on a benchmark set of small diatomic molecules , which constitute paradigms of both single- and multi - reference problems : the n@xmath44 , f@xmath44 and csh molecules .",
    "the matrix representation of the one and two - orbital reduced density matrices @xmath15 and @xmath21 introduced above can be constructed from fermionic correlation functions @xcite or from generalized correlation functions@xcite . in the following , we present the formalism relying on the latter ones . for a spin-1/2 fermionic model , like the one under consideration here , single - electron basis states ( orbitals )",
    "can be empty , occupied with an @xmath13-(spin - up ) or a @xmath45-(spin - down ) electron , or doubly occupied with two electrons of paired spin .",
    "these states we denote as @xmath46* * -0.31 cm @xmath47 , @xmath46* * -0.31 cm @xmath48 @xmath47 , @xmath46* * -0.31 cm @xmath49 @xmath47 , and @xmath46* * -0.364 cm @xmath50 @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "since the local basis is four dimensional , 16 possible operators @xmath51 arise , @xmath52 which operate on the basis states of a single orbital @xmath17 ( with @xmath53 being the four - dimensional unit matrix and the action of @xmath54 as summarized in table [ tab : fermion - ops ] ( for @xmath55 ) ) .",
