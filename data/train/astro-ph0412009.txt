    "for more than half a century , evidence for the turbulent nature of the interstellar medium ( ism ) has been known ( von weiszcker @xcite ; mnch @xcite ) .",
    "armstrong , rickett , & spangler ( @xcite ) compiled observations of the ionized ism that appear to show that the magnetized gas has a fluctuation power spectrum consistent with kolmogorov ( @xcite ) turbulence over scales ranging from 100  pc to small fractions of an au .",
    "other observations pointing to the presence of supersonic , magnetized turbulence in the ism include the presence of superthermal linewidths in the diffuse ionized medium , the warm and cold neutral gas , and molecular clouds .",
    "line centroid variations also show correlations with separation suggestive of turbulence .",
    "magnetic field strengths are measured using the zeeman effect or , more recently , the chandrasekhar - fermi ( @xcite ) method ( heitsch et al .  @xcite ; ostriker , stone , & gammie @xcite ; matthews , fiege , & moriarty - schieven @xcite ; crutcher et al .",
    "small scale fluctuations are measured using refractive and diffractive pulsar scintillation , and fluctuations in rotation measure and dispersion measure .",
    "this review briefly discusses the density and temperature structure of turbulent gas , as a counterpoint to multi - phase models of the ism .",
    "analytic descriptions of magnetized turbulence are then treated , as well as numerical tests of those descriptions .",
    "the observational consequences of density fluctuations on the line centroid velocity fluctuation spectrum are briefly noted . finally the question of whether magnetized turbulence can support against gravitational collapse is reviewed .",
    "topics that are not covered that fall under the general topic include magnetized turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability , dynamos and field structure in turbulent flow , and diffusion of cosmic rays or tracers such as heavy elements .",
    "classical theories of the interstellar medium have emphasized the thermal phases produced by the structure of the cooling curve as a function of temperature ( field , goldsmith , & habing @xcite ; for a modern example see wolfire et al .",
    "@xcite ) . at constant pressure",
    ", isolated points of stable equilibrium can be found on the pressure - density plane , giving phase structure to the ism .",
    "however , turbulent flows generate continuous distributions of pressure ( mac low et al .",
    "@xcite ; avillez & breitschwerdt @xcite ) , a point also emphasized by breitschwerdt and avillez in these proceedings . although thermal instability still acts in such flows , broad regions on the pressure - density plane end up occupied , rather than isolated phases .",
    "our understanding of magnetized turbulence rests on the foundations of the kolmogorov ( @xcite ) theory for the energy spectrum of incompressible hydrodynamical turbulence .",
    "this theory requires two assumptions : that energy input at large scale and energy dissipation at small scale balance , and that energy transfer between spatial scales occurs only between neighboring scales in the intervening inertial range . or , to quote richardson ,    _ _ _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ big whirls have little whirls , which feed on their velocity , + and little whirls have lesser whirls , and so on to viscosity . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the energy of incompressible turbulence @xmath0 , and the crossing time of a perturbation over any scale @xmath1 is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the average velocity difference across structures at that scale .",
    "the assumptions of constant flow between neighboring scales requires that the energy flow through any scale @xmath4 must be constant .",
    "thus , the velocity must scale as @xmath5 in wavenumber space , @xmath6 .",
    "we can derive the energy spectrum in wavenumber space @xmath7 in either 1d or 3d . in 1d , the energy in some portion of the inertial range @xmath8 substituting the scaling relation derived from equation  [ eq : edot ] , @xmath9 , so @xmath10 . in 3d ,",
    "@xmath11 , so @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "a theory of incompressible mhd turbulence was proposed by iroshnikov ( @xcite ) and kraichnan ( @xcite ) based on the idea that energy transfer between scales would still be local , but transferred by interactions between oppositely directed alfvn waves rather than vortices .",
    "isotropy was still assumed in their derivation , however , as was a small ratio of fluctuating to mean magnetic field strength .",
    "the interaction time between alfvn waves at any scale @xmath14 is determined by their propagation speed @xmath15 . the change in any energy from each interaction @xmath16 the perturbation crossing time",
    "@xmath17 determines the change in velocity @xmath18 , so @xmath19 the time required for energy to pass through an incoherent cascade can be shown to be @xmath20 so the energy flow @xmath21 . if the energy flow through each scale is constant , then @xmath22 in this case . the energy spectrum in 1d can then be derived analogously to the hydrodynamic spectrum , yielding @xmath23",
    ".    however , mhd turbulence in the presence of a mean field with energy of the same order as the flow is not isotropic .",
    "goldreich & sridhar ( @xcite ) argued that the anisotropy can be taken into account by treating the energy cascade along parallel lines as alfvn wave interactions with time scale @xmath24 , following iroshnikov and kraichnan , but treating the perpendicular cascade with hydrodynamic interactions that merely stir field lines with time scale @xmath25 .",
    "if the cascades in the two directions maintain what is referred to as critical balance and proceed at equal rates , so that @xmath26 , then @xmath27 . from the hydrodynamic cascade ,",
    "we know that @xmath28 , so the anisotropy of the turbulence can be derived to be scale dependent : @xmath29 .",
    "the parallel cascade is predicted to still be an alfvn cascade with @xmath30 , while the perpendicular cascade looks more like a kolmogorov cascade with @xmath31 .",
    "the 1d spectrum is predicted to be @xmath32 .",
    "maron & goldreich ( @xcite ) confirmed the anisotropy predicted , but found a 1d spectral index of 3/2 .",
    "cho & vishniac ( @xcite ) , and maron , cowley , & mcwilliams ( @xcite ) on the other hand , do find the predicted 5/3 spectral index .",
    "the difference appears to be the strength of the initial field .",
    "if the fluctuations in the magnetic field are small compared to the mean field , the local alfvn cascade dominates , as found by maron & goldreich ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the fluctuations are larger , though , the perpendicular hydrodynamic cascade takes effect , as seen by cho & vishniac ( @xcite ) and maron et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , if the fields are weak compared to the flow , as in the case of the turbulent dynamo , the magnetic cascade is no longer local , and the power spectrum of the field is dominated by high-@xmath33 modes , while the velocity power spectrum remains dominated by the driving scale ( e.g.  maron et al .",
    "one diagnostic of turbulence is the fluctuation in velocity centroid from point to point across a map .",
    "this is a projection of the 3d velocity fluctuation spectrum into 2d .",
    "the 3d spectral exponent is @xmath34 in the incompressible hydrodynamical case ( eq .   [ eq : vscale ] ) , while for shock - dominated burgers turbulence @xmath35 ( burgers @xcite ) .",
    "the projection to 2d should reduce the value of @xmath36 by 0.5 in the incompressible case ( von hoerner @xcite , brunt et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the observed value of the 2d velocity centroid fluctuation spectrum is close to 0.5 ( e.g. brunt & mac low @xcite ) , as if no projection smoothing had occurred .",
    "supersonic turbulence drives density fluctuations .",
    "velocity centroids depend on both velocity fluctuations and density fluctuations , as the emissivity at any particular velocity along a line of sight depends on the density at that point .",
    "these density fluctuations add extra power at small scales , increasing the slope of the velocity centroid fluctuation spectrum ( lazarian & esquivel @xcite ; brunt & mac low @xcite ) . by a lucky coincidence ,",
    "the density fluctuations in strongly supersonic turbulence cancel the effects of projection smoothing rather accurately .",
    "this does not hold for transsonic or subsonic turbulence however , and there is a transition region in the mildly supersonic regime where the cancellation is incomplete ( brunt & mac low @xcite ) .",
    "velocity structure functions offer another way of statistically characterizing turbulence that has proved tractable to analytic description . the structure function of order @xmath37 at scale",
    "@xmath38 is @xmath39 the structure function of order two can be directly related to the energy spectrum @xmath7 . in the inertial range of isotropic turbulence ,",
    "structure functions scale as a power of the length scale @xmath40 .",
    "the behavior of the power - law exponents @xmath41 as a function of the order @xmath37 is argued to depend on the dimension @xmath42 of dissipative structures in the turbulence , along with the scaling exponents for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( she & lvque @xcite ; dubrulle @xcite ) .",
    "the form of the scaling is @xmath45 where the codimension @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . in kolmogorov turbulence ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : vscale ] ) shows that @xmath48 , so @xmath49 .    in incompressible hydrodynamical turbulence ,",
    "the dissipative structures are linear vortex tubes with dimension @xmath50 ( she & lvque @xcite ) .",
    "mller & biskamp ( @xcite ) showed that incompressible mhd behaves as if its dissipative structures have dimension @xmath51 ; they suggested that these structures are current sheets .",
    "compressible mhd has also been examined .",
    "boldyrev ( @xcite ) and boldyrev , nordlund , & padoan ( @xcite ) suggest that the dissipative structures have @xmath51 and are primarily shocks .",
    "padoan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that in super - alfvnic but subsonic to transsonic turbulence @xmath52 depending on the sonic mach number @xmath53 .",
    "however , vestuto et al.(@xcite ) raise a note of caution , as they find steeper power laws for energy spectra than would be predicted by the velocity structure function of order 2 under this formalism .",
    "an important question for understanding star formation is whether magnetized turbulence can provide support against gravitational collapse . in order to provide significant support , it must act like a pressure in all directions , and it must last longer than a free - fall time .",
    "neither of these requirements is clearly met by supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds .",
    "furthermore , hydrostatically supported objects do not form easily in supersonic turbulent flows .",
    "this is because an isothermal object in hydrostatic equilibrium requires a balancing external pressure to confine it .",
    "too high a pressure sends it into collapse , while too low a pressure allows it to again expand .",
    "vzquez - semadeni , et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have demonstrated numerically that these two paths are taken by virtually all density fluctuations in a magnetized turbulent flow , leaving very few objects that might be subject to ambipolar diffusion and loss of magnetic support over long time periods .",
    "rather , the star formation rate appears to be limited by the necessity of assembling supercritical regions by moving gas along field lines in order to increase the mass - to - flux ratio , and by the global limitation of collapse by the turbulence , when that is effective .",
    "if turbulence decays in less than a free - fall time , it will not provide significant support against gravitational collapse . for several decades , arons & max ( @xcite ) was interpreted to mean that magnetic fields could substantially reduce the decay rate of turbulence . in the late 1990 s , three groups demonstrated numerically that even magnetized turbulence decays quickly ( mac low et al .",
    "@xcite , stone , ostriker , & gammie @xcite , padoan & nordlund @xcite ) .",
    "mac low et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that supersonic , trans - alfvnic or super - alfvnic turbulence decays as @xmath54 , with a resolution study ranging from 32@xmath55 to 256@xmath55 zones .",
    "there are a couple of exceptions to this quick decay known , although their astrophysical relevance remains to be demonstrated .",
    "biskamp & mller ( @xcite ) used 512@xmath55 simulations of incompressible mhd to show that @xmath56 for flows with magnetic helicity @xmath57 , but that @xmath58 for flows with significant helicity .",
    "unbalanced cascades of alfvn waves have been shown to decay more slowly by maron & goldreich ( @xcite ) and cho , lazarian , & vishniac ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , to reduce decay significantly , alfvn wave fluxes must be as much as an order of magnitude higher in one direction than the opposite .",
    "mac low ( @xcite ) estimates that the dissipation rate for isothermal , supersonic turbulence is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the driving scale .",
    "the dissipation time for turbulent kinetic energy @xmath61 which is just the crossing time for the turbulent flow across the driving scale ( elmegreen @xcite ) .",
    "stone et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and mac low ( @xcite ) showed that supersonic turbulence decays in less than a free - fall time under molecular cloud conditions , regardless of whether it is magnetized or unmagnetized .",
    "the hydrodynamical result agrees with the high - resolution , transsonic , decaying models of porter & woodward ( @xcite ) and porter , pouquet , & woodward ( @xcite ) .",
    "mac low ( @xcite ) showed that the formal dissipation time @xmath62 scaled in units of the free fall time @xmath63 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the kolmogorov energy - dissipation coefficient derived by mac low ( @xcite ) , @xmath66 is the rms mach number of the turbulence , and @xmath67 is the ratio of the driving wavelength to the jeans wavelength @xmath68 . in molecular clouds ,",
    "@xmath69 is typically observed to be of order 10 or higher .",
    "if the ratio @xmath70 , as is probably required to maintain gravitational support ( lorat , passot , & pouquet @xcite ) , then even strongly magnetized turbulence will decay long before the cloud collapses , and not markedly retard the collapse .",
    "supersonic turbulence both prevents and promotes collapse .",
    "it can provide support against collapse on scales larger than the driving scale .",
    "classical theories treat small - scale turbulence as an isotropic pressure with effective sound speed @xmath71 ( chandrasekhar @xcite ; von weiszcker @xcite ) . by this argument , supersonic turbulence _",
    "increases _ the jeans mass to @xmath72 .",
    "however , supersonic flows drive strong density fluctuations on scales below the driving scale .",
    "positive density fluctuations in isothermal turbulence reach densities @xmath73 . in these density enhancements , the jeans mass _ decreases _ to @xmath74 . if we express everything in terms of velocity , however , @xmath75 even though turbulence can locally promote collapse , on average it _ inhibits _ collapse when compared to the same conditions absent turbulence .",
    "thus , although turbulence may give the appearance of locally triggering collapse and star formation , it is globally preventing star formation , acting as a counterbalance to gravitational instability .",
    "turbulence controls star formation in opposition to gravity , not in alliance with gravity .",
