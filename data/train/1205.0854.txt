    "the accurate description of the single - particle ( s.p . ) strength in atomic nuclei is , to a large extent , an open issue ( for a recent discussion see , e.g. , ref .",

    "modern self - consistent models ( either based on the mean - field hamiltonians or on some implementation of density functional theory ) do not reproduce , as a rule , the level density around the fermi surface .",

    "the basic ideas leading to particle - vibration coupling ( pvc ) models in spherical nuclei , or particle - rotation coupling models in deformed systems , have been discussed in textbooks @xcite .",
    "these couplings provide dynamical content to the standard shell model , in keeping with the fact that the average potential becomes nonlocal in time or , in other words , frequency- or energy - dependent .",
    "we will call self - energy , in what follows , the dynamical part of the mean potential arising from vibrational coupling .",
    "this contribution will be added to the static hartree - fock ( hf ) potential . in this way",

    "these calculations are mostly not self - consistent and it is hard to extract from them quantitative conclusions because of the various approximations involved . certainly , they all agree qualitatively in pointing out that pvc plays a decisive role to bring the density of levels near the fermi energy in better agreement with experiment or , in other words , the effective mass @xmath3 close to the empirical value @xmath4 .",
    "this enhancement of the effective mass around the fermi energy , as compared to the hf value , is only one example of a phenomenon that can be explained by assuming that single - particle and vibrational degrees of freedom are not independent .",
    "other examples , although not treated in the current work , are worth to be mentioned in this introduction .",
    "several works have identified the exchange of vibrational quanta ( phonons ) between particles as one important mechanism responsible for nuclear pairing @xcite . in the approach of @xcite and references therein ,",
    "one aims at explaining the properties of superfluid nuclei by taking into account both the pairing induced by the phonon exchange and the self - energy mentioned above ( cf . also the discussion in refs .",
    "we also remark that important developments are under way aiming at implementing _ ab - initio _ calculation schemes for open shell nuclei , based on self - consistent green s functions @xcite or on the unitary correlation operator method @xcite ) . along the same line ,",
    "more complicated processes can be explained by starting from elementary single - particle and vibrational degrees of freedom , and treating their coupling within the framework of an appropriate field theory : the spreading width of nuclear giant resonances , or the anharmonicity of two - phonon states ( to mention only a few examples ) .",
    "the development of such a general many - body perturbation theory scheme could not avoid , so far , to resort to various approximations .",

    "the results seem to be satisfactory , in a qualitative or semi - quantitative sense , as they point to an increase of the effective mass around the fermi energy .",
    "the results are clearly sensitive to the collectivity of the low - lying phonons produced by the self - consistent calculations .",
    "it is still unclear whether the results will eventually be improved by a re - fitting of the effective interactions or by the inclusion of higher - order processes .",
    "one of the limitations of all the pvc models that have been introduced so far , lies in the fact that they discretize the s.p .",

    "the sign @xmath59 guarantees that the level density is positive , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sign + ( - ) refers to particle ( hole ) states .",
    "this is equivalent to the definition @xmath60 and is normalized to 1 for bound states . in the absence of any potential",

    "in fact , if this coupling is small one can expect a simple shift of the hf peaks . otherwise , the s.p",
    ". strength can be quite fragmented : the associated widths reflect the basic decay mechanisms that are the nucleon decay ( providing the so - called escape width , or @xmath77 ) and the spreading into the complicated configurations made up with nucleons and vibrations ( providing the spreading width @xmath78 ) .",
    "we shall present results for three nuclei : @xmath0ca , @xmath1pb and @xmath2o .",
    "the effective skyrme interaction sly5 @xcite is used to calculate the hf mean field .",
    "the calculation of the rpa response is carried out exactly as described in ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit of no pairing , using all the terms of the sly5 interaction , except for the two - body spin - dependent terms , the spin - orbit terms and the coulomb term in the residual p - h force . in the calculations , the angular momentum cutoff for the unoccupied continuum states",

    "( [ selfen2 ] ) ] and @xmath83 [ cf .",
    "( [ hfdyson3 ] ) ] .",
    "there are a few important issues that we wish to stress :    1 .",
    "due specifically to the zero - range character of the skyrme interaction , the self - energy diverges logarithmically as a function of the maximum energy of the phonons , as it has mentioned above .",
    "the first steps towards a systematic renormalization procedure have only recently been started to be worked out @xcite . in this work",
    ", we shall take the usual view that the important couplings are those associated with the collective low - lying states and giant resonances .",
    "we shall then include phonons associated with the multipolarities @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and set an upper cutoff on the phonon energies given by @xmath88 mev because no strong peaks are present above this value in the calculated rpa strengths .",
    "the way in which this cutoff is implemented has been described in detail in [ sub_contour ] .",
    "2 .   in the present scheme",
    ", the price to be paid for the exact continuum treatment , is that one can not discriminate between the inclusion of collective and non - collective phonons . actually , the diagrams shown in figs .",
    "[ selfendiag ]   and [ dysondiag ] contain terms that violate the pauli principle , and these terms are larger when the phonons are non - collective . in other words , one could expect that in an exact calculation the correction of the pauli principle violation cancels , to a large extent , the contributions from non - collective phonons .",
    "although this point has never been clarified in the available literature , to our knowledge , on a quantitative basis , in most of the cases the usual view has been to take into account only the coupling to collective states . in the work that we quoted already ( the most similar to the present one ) , namely in the recent calculation of particle - vibration coupling in @xmath0ca and @xmath1pb of ref .",
    "@xcite , only phonons exhausting at least 5% of the isoscalar or isovector non - energy - weighted sum rules have been taken into account .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the effect of particle - vibration coupling is larger when we calculate it with the present method , as compared with ref .",
    "we shall come back to this issue below .",
    "the momentum - dependent part of the particle - hole interaction had previously been neglected in the calculation of the particle - vibration coupling ; then , in ref . @xcite it was shown that its effect is important ( at least in the case of the sly5 interaction ) , and that it can be reasonably accounted for within the landau - migdal ( lm ) approximation , by choosing the fermi momentum @xmath89 as 1.33 @xmath90 ( that is , at the value associated with the nuclear matter saturation density ) .",
    "the lm approximation will be adopted in the following , with the same value of @xmath89 .",
    "the first essential steps of our work consist in the calculation of the hf spectrum and of the rpa strength functions .",
    "the results are illustrated respectively in table [ splvtbca40 ] ( hf single - particle spectrum ) and in fig .",
    "[ str_ca40 ] ( isoscalar and isovector rpa strength functions associated with the multipolarities @xmath91 and @xmath87 ) . in table [ lwst_ca40 ] we give the theoretical energies and transition strengths for the low - lying collective @xmath85 and @xmath87 states , comparing them with available data .",
    ".neutron single - particle energies in @xmath0ca . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ lvdo24 ] , we display our results for the level density of @xmath2o . before entering into some detail , we discuss the main emerging features and compare with what is known experimentally . in our calculation ,",
    "the 1d@xmath92 and 2s@xmath93 states have a marked quasiparticle character , namely they are associated with a single narrow peak .",
    "it makes sense , therefore , to compare the experimental value of the gap with the hf and hf - pvc results for the energy difference between the 1d@xmath92 and 2s@xmath93 states , that is , 4.0 and 4.6 mev respectively .",
    "the hf - pvc result is in good agreement with the experimental value of 4.86 mev . in heavy nuclei , as a rule",
    ", the pvc shrinks the single - particle gap and increases the effective mass ( cf . the previous subsection ) , but this is not the case in light nuclei due to the specific effect of having only low angular momentum occupied states ( as already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present case , while the pvc pushes the 1d@xmath92 orbital closer to the fermi energy ( -2.5 mev compared to the hf value of -1.3 mev ) , the 2s@xmath93 hole state is pushed further from it ( -7.1 mev compared to the hf value of -5.3 mev ) .",
    "the peak energies of the other orbitals obtained by using hf - pvc ( hf ) read 2.4 mev ( 4.3 mev ) for 1f@xmath94 , and -8.3 mev ( -7.5 mev ) for 1d@xmath95 .",
    "the net effect of pvc is a shift down of the states .",
    "the absolute value of the energies is expected to depend on the choice of the effective force .",
    "skyrme forces , as other mean - field frameworks , tend to predict larger binding in light neutron - rich nuclei as compared with the experimental findings , as it is clearly testified by the fact that @xmath96o turns out to be bound in many of these models . in the present case ,",
    "the 1d@xmath92 state is bound while it should be a resonant state .",
    "we can nonetheless look at relative energy differences .",
    "the known states in @xmath97o taken from ref .",
    "@xcite are , in addition to the 1/2@xmath98 ground - state , a 5/2@xmath98 state at 2.79 mev and a 3/2@xmath98 at 4.04 mev ( leaving aside the state at 5.34 whose character is not clear , being either 3/2@xmath99 or 7/2@xmath99 ) .",
    "these are states that can decay to the @xmath100o ground state . in our calculation",
    "we can identify states below the energy threshold for this kind of decay : in particular the first 5/2@xmath98 state lies at 1.2 mev in our calculation .",

    "the configuration @xmath110 is the most important one , and the low - lying @xmath84 state at 3.4 mev is the most relevant .",

    "more generally , in our calculations the coupling of neutron states is mainly with the proton component of the phonon states ( due to the dominance of the neutron - proton interaction ) .",
    "therefore , neutron states on neutron - rich nuclei are expected to be more pure because proton excitations are pushed at higher energy as the neutron excess increases . recently , other calculations of the spectroscopic factors in light nuclei within the coupled - cluster approach have become available in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also the critical discussion in ref .",
    "the idea that single - particle strength is not systematically pure in atomic nuclei , and that coupling with other degrees of freedom is quite relevant , is an old idea in nuclear physics .",
    "phenomenological calculations based on particle - vibration coupling ( pvc ) for spherical nuclei have been performed for several deacades , and they have been quite instrumental to point out some of the limitations of the pure mean - field approach ( like , e.g. , the enhancement of the effective mass around the fermi energy ) .",

    "this is of special interest if weakly - bound nuclei close to the drip lines are to be studied .",
    "however , also in well - bound nuclei the present approach present advantages in the sense that resonant states can be properly studied .",
    "transfer to the continuum has been the subject of several experimental studies .    in stable nuclei",
    "we obtain results that are in overall agreement with previous studies .",
    "we can , at the same time , better describe the fragmentation of the single - particle strength .",
    "the shifts of the single - particle states around the fermi energy , with respect to the hf values , are relatively large ( in keeping also with the fact that we can not restrict our coupling to collective states only ) .",
    "we obtain an overall agreement with experiment in @xmath1pb , while in the case of @xmath0ca our results point to the need of re - fitting the skyrme interaction that has been devised to work at the mean - field level and not beyond it .",
    "we have also applied our model to a neutron - rich nucleus , namely @xmath2o .",
    "this is a double - magic nucleus , and there are few low - lying states .",
    "because of this , and also since the neutron states energy would be more affected by coupling with protons , the neutron single - particle strength around the fermi energy is quite pure ( i.e. , spectroscopic factors are rather close to one ) .",

    "both formulations give the same results for the physical part of the spectrum , namely for positive excitation energy .",
    "however , a complete rpa basis must include negative energy states and the two aforementioned formulations are different for negative energies .    in order to construct the self - energy function of eq .",
    "( [ selfen ] ) , we need to consider the rpa response function not only in the positive energy domain but also in the negative energy domain due to the required energy integration .",
    "so we can not use the _ retarded _ rpa response function for the self - energy function .",
    "the rpa equation for the response function is given by @xmath121 in any of the representations , @xmath122 being the unperturbed response function , and @xmath26 the rpa response function . in order to obtain the _ causal _ rpa response function by solving this equation , the _ causal _ unperturbed response function should be used .",
    "normally the continuum ( q)rpa is formulated by using _",
    "retarded _ functions within the linear response theory .",
    "the continuum hf(b ) green s function is used to build the ( retarded ) unperturbed response function @xcite .",
    "it is therefore necessary to know how to convert the retarded unperturbed response function to the causal function in the continuum rpa formalism .",
    "we show it in the present appendix .",
    "the _ causal _ and _ retarded _ response function in rpa are defined by @xmath123    @xmath124 is the hf ground state ) . from these definitions",
    ", one can find the relation between them as follows , @xmath125    the fourier transformation of the latter equation gives @xmath126 where @xmath127 can be expressed by means of the retarded hf green s function as @xmath128 in the continuum rpa formalism , the continuum hf green s function is used as @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ cunpres ] ) .",
    "here we show the spectral representations of the hf green s function and the rpa response function ( both causal and retarded ) . the difference will appear in the sign of the imaginary part @xmath57 .",
    "actually this is very important to obtain the proper self - energy function by using the contour integration , because this sign differencee produce changes in the position of the poles of the green s function and of the response function on the complex energy plane ( this fact is connected with the fact that the wick s theorem can be applied only for the causal function , as already mentioned ) .",
    "@xmath130    @xmath131",
    "the self - energy function in the space - time representation is defined by eq .",
    "( [ selfenrt ] ) .",
    "if we insert the hf and the rpa results in this definition , then the self - energy function can be expressed as @xmath132    the fouriter transform of eq .",
    "( [ selfenrt2 ] ) gives @xmath133",
