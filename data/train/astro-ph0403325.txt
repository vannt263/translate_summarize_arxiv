    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of the high galactic latitude sky visible from the northern hemisphere .",
    "the principal survey goals are to measure the large - scale distribution of galaxies and quasars and to produce an imaging and spectroscopic legacy for the astronomical community .",
    "the sdss data have been used in well over 200 refereed papers to date on subjects ranging from the colors of asteroids ( ivezi et al .",
    "2002 ) to magnetic white dwarfs ( schmidt et al .  2003 ) to structures in the galactic halo ( newberg et al .",
    "2003 ) to the star - formation history of galaxies ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ) to type ii quasars ( zakamska et al .",
    "2003 ) to the large - scale distribution of galaxies ( pope et al .  2004",
    "; tegmark et al .",
    "the survey uses a dedicated 2.5 m telescope with a three - degree field of view at apache point observatory , new mexico .",
    "a 120 mega - pixel camera ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) images in five broad bands ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; fukugita et al.1996 ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) on clear moonless nights of good seeing .",
    "these data are photometrically calibrated using an auxiliary 20-inch telescope with a @xmath4 imager , which determines the photometricity of each night ( hogg et al .",
    "2001 ) , and measures the extinction and photometric zeropoint using a network of standard stars ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the imaging data are processed through a series of pipelines that locate and measure the properties of all detected objects ( lupton et al .",
    "2001 ) and carry out photometric and astrometric calibration ( pier et al .",
    "2003 ) . from the resulting catalogs of objects ,",
    "complete catalogs of galaxies ( eisenstein et al.2001 ; strauss et al .  2002 ) and quasar candidates ( richards et al.2002 ) are selected for spectroscopic followup , and are assigned to spectroscopic tiles of diameter 3 degrees ( blanton et al.2003 ) .",
    "spectroscopy is performed on nights with moonlight , mild cloud cover , and/or poor seeing using a pair of double spectrographs with coverage from 38009200 , and resolution @xmath5 of roughly 2000 .",
    "a plug plate for each tile holds 640 optical fibers of @xmath6 entrance aperture which feed the spectrographs , together with eleven coherent fiber bundles to image guide stars . because of the diameter of the cladding holding the optical fibers ,",
    "spectroscopy can not be carried out for objects separated by less than @xmath7 on a given plate .",
    "a high - level overview of the sdss may be found in york et al .",

    "( 2002 ; hereafter the edr paper ) .",
    "the latter paper also describes our early data release ( edr ) , which consisted mostly of data taken during our commissioning period .",
    "the first data release was made public in april 2003 ; abazajian et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter the dr1 paper ) describe these data and give further details and updates on the quality of the data and its processing .",
    "the current paper describes the second data release of the sdss ( dr2 ) , which was made available to the public on 15 march 2004 .",
    "the properties of dr2 are summarized in table  [ tab : characteristics ] .",
    "the dr2 footprint is defined by all non - repeating survey - quality imaging runs within the a priori defined elliptical survey area in the nothern galactic cap , and three stripes in the southern galactic cap ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) obtained prior to 1 july 2002 , and the spectroscopy associated with that area obtained before that date .",
    "in fact , 34 square degrees of dr2 imaging data in the northern galactic cap lie outside this ellipse .",
    "while the dr2 scans do not repeat a given area of sky , they do overlap to some extent , and the data in the overlaps are included in dr2 as well .",
    "the dr2 includes reprocessing of all data included in dr1 , and those data in edr that pass our data - quality criteria for the official survey .",
    "the sky coverage of the imaging and spectroscopic data that make up dr2 is given in figure  [ fig : dr1image ] .",
    "the effective areas of the two are 3324 and 2627 square degrees , respectively .",
    "the natural unit of imaging data is a _ run _ ; the dr2 contains data from 105 runs in the best database , and 105 runs in the target database ( best and target are defined in   [ sec : imaging ] ) .",
    "similarly , the natural unit of spectroscopic data is a _ plate _ of 640 spectra each ( of which 32 are devoted to background sky determination ) ; the dr2 contains data from 574 plates .",
    ", width=453 ]    the dr2 data are available via links off the web site http://www.sdss.org/dr2 , which also includes extensive technical information about the sdss data , and should be checked for errata and caveats to the data .",
    "the types of data that are available are described in detail in the dr1 and edr papers , and on the above web site .",
    "there are two principal ways to access the data .",
    "the first , the data archive server ( das ) , allows one to download the fits files containing the imaging and spectroscopic catalogs , the images themselves , and the spectra .",
    "this is the appropriate place to go to download large quantities of data in bulk .",
    "the second option , the catalog archive server ( cas ) , allows one to perform database queries by object attributes and to obtain finding charts of given regions of sky and plots of the spectra .",
    "the cas also provides pointers to the survey images and spectra in fits format .",
    "the edr paper ( stoughton et al .  2002 ) describes the sdss data in detail .",
    "we do not repeat that description here , but put emphasis on changes since dr1 and new - found problems in imaging (   [ sec : imaging ] ) , spectroscopy (   [ sec : spectroscopy ] ) , and target selection (   [ sec : target ] ) .",

    "the sdss imaging pipelines have evolved as the survey has progressed , leading to continual improvements in the measured quantities . however",
    ", this means that much of the spectroscopic targetting is based on reductions carried out with old versions of the imaging pipelines . for this reason",
    ", we release two versions of the imaging data for each area of the sky .",
    "the target version is that which was used for defining spectroscopic targets of a given region , while the best version uses the latest version of the imaging pipelines . in some cases ,",
    "improved data ( e.g. , with better seeing ) were taken in a given region of sky after targetting was done , in which case the target and best data are independent runs .",
    "a total of 183 square degrees of sky are different runs between target and best , the majority along the equatorial stripe in the fall sky .    the quality of the imaging data is described in the edr and dr1 papers ; the distribution of seeing , sky brightness , and depth for the dr2 data are no different than for dr1 , nor are the accuracies of the astrometric and photometric calibrations .",
    "the best reductions do , however , have some substantial improvements over what was included in dr1 .",
    "we now describe these improvements , and give further caveats of problems that have since come to light .",
    "the computation of model magnitudes in the dr1 and edr processing had a serious bug .",
    "the image of each object detected in any of the five bands in the imaging data is fit to de vaucouleurs ( @xmath23 $ ] ) and exponential ( @xmath24 $ ] ) radial profiles of arbitrary axis ratio and inclination , convolved with the local point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "however , these fits used an incorrect model of the psf , which caused systematic errors in the fit parameters , especially for objects of small scale size @xmath25 ( i.e. , close to a psf ) . for each of these model fits , the code determined an aperture correction to force the exponential and de vaucouleurs magnitudes to equal the psf magnitude for stars ; this correction was then applied to _ all _ objects . because of this software error , this aperture correction was large , 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "thus the model magnitudes of galaxies were systematically too large by typically 0.2 magnitudes . in the mean , exponential scale lengths rexp were overestimated by @xmath26 for objects with @xmath27 , while de vaucouleurs scale lengths rdev were overestimated by a factor 1.25 for large objects , and as much as a factor of 2 for objects with @xmath28 .",
    "this error has been fixed in the latest version of the pipeline , and has been extensively tested with simulations .",
    "the code now also takes the best fit exponential and de vaucouleurs fits in each band and asks for the linear combination of the two that best fits the image .",
    "the coefficient ( clipped between zero and one ) of the de vaucouleurs term is stored in the quantity fracdev .",
    "this allows us to define a _",
    "composite flux _ : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the de vaucouleurs and exponential fluxes ( _ not _ magnitudes ) of the object in question .",
    "the magnitude derived from @xmath32 is referred to below as the cmodel magnitude ( as distinct from the model magnitude , based on the better - fitting of the exponential and de vaucouleurs models in the @xmath11 band ; see the edr paper ) .    with these changes in place , there is now excellent agreement between cmodel  and petrosian magnitudes of galaxies , and cmodel  and psf magnitudes of stars ( figure  [ fig : modelmag ] ) .",
    "cmodel  and petrosian magnitudes are not expected to be identical , of course ; as strauss et al .",
    "( 2002 ) describe , the petrosian aperture excludes the outer parts of galaxy profiles , especially for elliptical galaxies . as a consequence , there is an offset of 0.050.1 mag between cmodel  and petrosian magnitudes of bright galaxies , depending on the photometric bandpass and the type of galaxy .",
    "the rms scatter between model and petrosian magnitudes at the bright end is now between 0.05 and 0.08 magnitudes , depending on bandpass ; the scatter between cmodel  and petrosian magnitudes for all galaxies is smaller , 0.03 to 0.05 magnitudes . for comparison ,",
    "the code that was used in the edr and dr1 had scatters of 0.1 mag and greater , with much more significant offsets .",
    "band model and petrosian magnitudes for red ( @xmath33 ; strateva et al .",
    "2001 ) galaxies brighter than @xmath34 ; the three curves are for the old ( dr1 ) reductions ( dashed ) , the current reductions using model magnitudes ( dotted ; dr2 ) , and the current reductions using cmodel magnitudes ( solid ; dr2c ) . the mode and standard deviation ( based on the interquartile range ) of each distribution are given .",
    "the bias in model magnitudes in the dr1 reductions is apparent .",
    "the second panel shows the same quantities for blue ( @xmath35 ) galaxies .",
    "the third panel shows the difference between cmodel  and psf magnitudes for @xmath36 stars , in the dr1 ( dotted ) and dr2 ( solid ) reductions ; the width of the distribution has decreased by 40% with the new reductions .",
    "[ fig : modelmag],width=453 ]    the cmodel  and psf magnitudes of stars are forced to be identical in the mean by aperture corrections ; this was true in older versions of the pipeline .",
    "the rms scatter between model and psf magnitudes for stars is much reduced , from 0.03 mag to 0.02 mag , the exact values depending on bandpass . in the edr and dr1 ,",
    "star - galaxy separation was based on the difference between model and psf magnitudes ( cf . the discussions in the edr paper , scranton et al .",
    "2002 , and strauss et al .",
    "we now do star - galaxy separation to set the type parameter in the pipeline outputs using the difference between cmodel  and psf magnitudes , with the threshold at the same value ( 0.145 magnitudes ) . given the excellent agreement between cmodel  magnitudes and psf magnitudes for point sources , and between cmodel  magnitudes and petrosian magnitudes ( albeit with intrinsic offsets due to aperture corrections ) for galaxies , the cmodel  magnitude is now an adequate proxy to use as a universal magnitude for all types of objects . as it is approximately a matched aperture to a galaxy",
    ", it has the great advantage over petrosian magnitudes , in particular , of having close to optimal noise properties .    for measuring _",
    "colors _ of extended objects , however , we continue to recommend using the model ( not the cmodel ) magnitudes ; the colors of galaxies were almost completely unaffected by the dr1 software error ( cf . , the discussion in   [ sec : target ] ) .",
    "the model magnitude is calculated using the best - fit parameters in the @xmath11 band , and applies it to all other bands ; the light is therefore measured consistently through the same aperture in all bands .",
    "there have been three substantial improvements to the algorithms which photometrically calibrate the spectra ( tremonti et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) : ( 1 ) improved matching of observed standard stars to models ; ( 2 ) tying the spectrophotometry directly to the observed fiber magnitudes from the photometric pipeline ; and ( 3 ) no longer using the `` smear '' exposures .",
    "_ analysis of spectroscopic standard stars : _ as described in the edr paper , each spectroscopic plate contains 16 spectrophotometric standard stars , chosen by their colors to be f subdwarf stars . in the edr and dr1 ` spectro2d ` calibration pipelines , fluxing was achieved by _ assuming _ that the mean spectrum of the stars on each half - plate was equivalent to a synthetic composite f8 subdwarf spectrum from pickles ( 1998 ) . in the reductions",
    "included in dr2 , the spectrum of each standard star is spectrally typed by comparing with a grid of theoretical spectra generated from kurucz model atmospheres ( cf .",
    "kurucz 1992 ) using the spectral synthesis code spectrum ( gray & corbally 1994 ; gray , graham , & hoyt 2001 ) .",
    "the flux calibration vector is derived from the average ratio of each star ( after correcting for schlegel et al .  [",
    "1998 ] reddening ) and its best - fit model .",
    "unlike the edr and dr1 , the final calibrated dr2 spectra are _ not _ corrected for foreground galactic reddening ( a relatively small effect ; the median @xmath59 over the survey is 0.034 ) .",
    "this may be changed in future data releases .",
    "_ improved comparison to fiber magnitudes : _ we now compute the absolute calibration by tying the @xmath11-band fluxes of the standard star spectra to the fiber magnitudes output by the latest version of the photometric pipeline .",
    "the latest version now corrects fiber magnitudes to a constant seeing of @xmath56 , and includes the contribution of flux from overlapping objects in the fiber aperture ; these changes greatly improve the overall data consistency .",
    "_ smears : _ as the edr paper describes , `` smear '' observations are low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectroscopic exposures made through an effective @xmath60 aperture , aligned with the parallactic angle .",
    "smears were designed to account for object light excluded from the @xmath6 fiber due to seeing , atmospheric refraction and object extent .",
    "however , extensive experiments comparing photometry and spectrophotometry calibrated with and without smear observations have shown that the smear correction provides improvements only for point sources ( stars and quasars ) with very high s / n . for extended sources ( galaxies ) the spectrum obtained in the 3  fiber aperture",
    "is calibrated to have the total flux and spectral shape of the light in the smear aperture .",
    "this is undesirable , for example , if the fiber samples the bulge of a galaxy , but the smear aperture includes much of its disk .",
    "for this reason , we do _ not _ apply the smear correction to the data in dr2 .    to the extent that all point sources are centered in the fibers in the same way as are the standards",
    ", our flux calibration scheme corrects the spectra for losses due to atmospheric refraction without the use of smears .",
    "extended sources are likely to be slightly over - corrected for atmospheric refraction .",
    "however , most galaxies are quite centrally concentrated and more closely resemble point sources than uniform extended sources . in the mean ,",
    "this overcorrection makes the @xmath15 color of the galaxy spectra too red by @xmath61% .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ sphoto1 ] compares @xmath11 fiber magnitudes with those synthesized from the spectra of all dr2 objects with spectral s / n per pixel greater than 5 . for point sources alone , this rms difference is 0.040 magnitudes , a 45% improvement over dr1 . for extended sources ,",
    "the effect of the smears was to give a systematic offset between spectroscopic and fiber magnitudes of up to a magnitude ; with the dr2 reductions , this trend is gone .",
    "the slight offset of the mean from zero is a seeing effect .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ sphoto1 ] compares the @xmath15 and @xmath16 colors derived from the spectra and photometry ; the scatter is @xmath62% lower in dr2 than in dr1 .",
    "the few percent offset of the colors from zero is an indication that there are small residual errors in our spectrophotometry , perhaps due to errors in the theoretical models used to calibrate the standard stars , or to offsets between our photometric system and a true ab system ( see the discussion at the end of   3 ) .",
    "magnitudes and @xmath63 colors synthesized from the spectra with ` photo ` fiber magnitudes . we have included all objects in dr2 with s / n per pixel @xmath64 .",
    "[ sphoto1 ] , width=453 ]    to evaluate our spectrophotometry over smaller scales , of order 100   , we compared the calibrated spectra of a sample of 166 hot da white dwarfs drawn from kleinman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to theoretical models . da",
    "white dwarfs are useful for this comparison because they have simple hydrogen atmospheres that can be accurately modeled ( e.g. , finley , koester , & basri 1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ sphoto2 ] shows the results of dividing each spectrum by its best fit model .",
    "the median of the curves shows a net residual of order 2% at the bluest wavelengths .",
    "this is a major improvement over dr1 where the residuals were of order 15% at 4300  due to the mismatch between the observed standard stars and the assumed model .",
    ", width=453 ]      .plates with known problems [ badplate ] [ cols=\"^,^ , < \" , ]     a small number of plates , listed in table  [ badplate ] , suffered from a variety of minor problems .",
    "the ccd frames for several plates suffered from a transient electronic problem in the left amplifier of the red camera in spectrograph 2 that randomly injected noise into either a single pixel or a cluster of pixels .",
    "these events mimic cosmic rays and are largely eliminated by the standard data processing pipeline , but they might leave artifacts in the reduced spectra .",
    "another set of plates labeled  many rejected pixels \" , suffered from having the spectrograph collimator improperly focused .",
    "this problem induced a mismatch between the flatfields and the spectra themselves , causing the optimal extraction process to reject an excessive number of pixels . comparing overlapping objects from adjacent plates",
    "confirms that the redshifts from these problematic plates are unbiased , but the spectra themselves should not be used for precision work or spectrophotometry .",
    "finally , during the exposure of one plate , light from an led somewhere on the telescope found its way to the spectrographs , resulting in an artificial excess of light centered roughly at 6500 ; the spectrophotometry of this plate is quite poor .",
    "spectra for approximately 35,000 galactic stars of all common spectral types , targetted both by the quasar target selection algorithm , and in directed stellar programs , are available with dr2 .",
    "radial velocities ( rvs ) are stored as redshifts and were measured by cross - correlation to a set of stellar templates .",
    "repeat observations of spectroscopic plates show that the stellar radial velocities are reproducible to roughly 5 km s@xmath22 for stars brighter than about @xmath65 .",
    "however , the dr2 cross - correlation procedure used introduces small additional systematic errors in addition to possible dispersion errors , depending on spectral type ; these systematics are of order 10 km s@xmath22 or less for stars of spectral type a through k with s / n per resolution element @xmath66 . for white dwarfs and low",
    "s / n a stars , lines are too broad for accurate rv determination , while m dwarf radial velocities are also less reliable due to prominent molecular bands .",
    "new for dr2 are measures of the centers and depths of the ca triplet lines ( 8500 , 8544 , 8664  ) ; these may be useful for more refined radial velocities of m stars .",
    "we note that in the edr and dr1 , zeropoint errors in the templates resulted in quoted rvs for low metallicity f stars that were too large by 20 km s@xmath22 , while the velocities of a - type stars were too large by 49 km s@xmath22 ( yanny et al .",
    "these problems were uncovered through an on - going process involving observations of known rv standards and cross checks with other model and template fitting techniques ; we hope to continue to improve the tabulated stellar properties in future data releases or as value added data product releases .",
    "each spectroscopic plate includes 32 sky fibers , placed in regions where the imaging data do not include a detected object ; by definition , there is no photometric object associated with these .",
    "similarly , there are 437 fibers among the 367,360 spectra in dr2 which were broken at the time of observation ; neither a spectrum nor a photometric object is associated with them . of the remainder , there are 62 objects for which the matching of fibers to objects can not be reconstructed with any confidence , and therefore whose right ascensions and declinations are uncertain . for these objects , the right ascension and declination are listed as @xmath67",
    ".    errors in the deblending algorithm in the target reductions caused spectroscopy to be carried out occasionally on non - existent objects ( e.g. , diffraction spikes of bright stars or satellite trails ) , or incorrectly shredded fragments of large galaxies ( at @xmath68 , a full 10% of galaxy targets are such fragments ) .",
    "many of these objects no longer exist in the best imaging reductions with its improvements to the deblender .",
    "in other cases , the photometric pipeline timed out during the best imaging reductions in fields for which target imaging proceeded without problem , so that the best photometry is missing for bona - fide objects .",
    "this predominantly happens in fields close to a few very bright stars .",
    "we expect to recover objects from these `` timeout holes '' in future data releases .",
    "a total of 663 spectroscopic objects therefore do not have a counterpart in the best images , 0.2% of the total .",
    "of these , 80 ( including the 62 unmapped fibers ) can only be retrieved from the table specobjall in the database .",
    "the remaining 583 objects are contained in the default spectroscopic table specobj , but will not be found by queries requesting both photometric and spectroscopic information .",
    "as described in the dr1 paper , we have compared the results of two independent codes to measure the redshifts of the spectra .",
    "these codes are the pipeline used for the official sdss reductions , whose redshifts are based on cross - correlation and emission - line fitting , and an independent pipeline which uses a @xmath69 method to fit templates directly to spectra ( e.g. , glazebrook et al .",
    "only 1.7% of the objects in dr2 not included in dr1 show gross differences in redshift and/or classification between the two codes .",
    "we examined the spectra of all these cases by eye .",
    "one third of those discrepancies are for very low s / n spectra , for which no redshift is determinable ; in the vast majority of these cases , both pipelines correctly indicated that they had failed .",
    "of the remainder , the redshifts or spectral classifications in the official reductions were clearly incorrect in 0.3% of the spectra , a few hundred objects in total ( many of them intrinsically interesting objects such as extreme broad - absorption line quasars , superpositions of objects , and other oddities ) .",
    "a list of corrections will be posted to the dr2 web site when it is completed .",
    "a similar exercise was carried out for the dr1 data ( and a similar error rate was found ) ; the resulting corrections are incorporated into the database .",
    "with the change in the model magnitude code (   [ sec : modelmag ] ) , the mean @xmath15 and @xmath16 model colors of galaxies have shifted by about 0.005 magnitudes . because the target selection for luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) is very sensitive to color , this would have increased the number density of targets by about 10% . instead , we shifted the lrg color cuts to compensate ; in addition , improved star - galaxy separation allows tighter cuts on the model - psf quantity by which stars are rejected .",
    "here we give the updated equations 2 and 3 respectively , from eisenstein et al .",

    "it is of course not applied retroactively to the target version of the sky , which used older versions of the pipeline .    due to other subtle differences in the photometric pipeline and the calibration",
    ", these changes will not exactly reproduce the selection criteria actually used when spectroscopy was carried out .",
    "indeed , defining an lrg sample based on the best reductions will result in large spectroscopic incompleteness because so many objects are close to the boundaries .",
    "instead , one should use the target photometry and adjust the calibrations of that relative to the best calibration .",
    "of course , if one is interested in photometric properties of single objects , then we recommend the best photometry .    the selection of the main galaxy sample ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) is based on petrosian magnitudes , which have not changed substantially with the latest versions of the pipelines .",
    "thus the magnitude limit for this sample , @xmath77 , has not changed .",
    "the improvements to the model magnitudes have allowed us to tighten the star - galaxy separation in galaxy target selection ; the code uses the same cut as lrg cut i ( equation  [ eq : star - galaxy ] ) .",
    "note that some of the edr and dr1 data were selected with other photometric limits ; see the discussion in appendix a of tegmark et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for details .    as described in the edr and dr1 papers and by schneider et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the quasar spectroscopic target selection algorithm has evolved in the history of the sdss . the final version described by richards et al.(2002 )",
    "went into effect just after the last of the dr1 data were taken .",
    "thus all dr2 data not included in dr1 ( i.e. , spectroscopic plate numbers greater than and including 716 ) use exactly the algorithm described in richards et al .",
    "the most important change implemented at that time was the addition of sharp color cuts for high - redshift quasars .",
    "as the name implies , dr2 is the second of a series of releases of what will eventually be the entire sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the third data release , dr3 , is planned for late 2004 .",
    "dr3 will include all sdss survey - quality data taken through june 2003 , and will include of order a 50% increment over dr2 in spectroscopy and imaging .",

    "as discussed in the edr paper , the sdss catalogs report asinh magnitudes ( lupton , gunn , & szalay 1999 ) instead of the conventional logarithmic magnitudes .",
    "the two magnitude definitions differ only for objects detected at low signal - to - noise with the sdss imaging camera .",
    "while asinh magnitudes produce meaningful colors for such objects , their magnitudes can not be converted into janskys or absolute magnitudes in the same way as those of brighter objects .",
    "we therefore give detailed instructions here for the conversion between sdss asinh magnitudes , janskys , and imaging camera counts . for reference ,",
    "the definition of asinh magnitudes is @xmath78,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the photometric zero point of each filter and @xmath80 is a softening parameter as given in table  [ tbl - bprime ] ( repeated from the edr paper ) .",
    "the asinh magnitude differs by more than 1% from the conventional magnitude for objects with flux less than about @xmath81 . for objects brighter than this ,",
    "conversion to jansky and absolute magnitude can be done in the same way as for conventional magnitudes with less than 1% error .        to the extent that the sdss photometry is on the ab system (   [ sec : caveat ] ) , the photometric zeropoint @xmath79 is given by 3631@xmath87jy ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) . with this and the assumption that the object s spectrum is flat in @xmath88",
    ", asinh magnitudes can be converted into janskies by inverting equation  ( [ luptitude ] ) . a correction for the spectral shape",
    "can be obtained from synthetic photometry using the sdss sensitivity curves which are available for download from the instruments / imager section of the sdss web site .    to convert between asinh magnitudes and counts @xmath89 on the sdss imaging camera , use equation  [ luptitude ] , replacing @xmath90 as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 are the photometric zeropoint , extinction term and airmass , respectively , for the object s field and filter from the field table or tsfield file ( these tables also contain the gain value ) , and @xmath95s , the exposure time for each sdss pixel ."

    "<S> the sloan digital sky survey has validated and made publicly available its second data release . </S>",
    "<S> this data release consists of 3324 square degrees of five - band ( @xmath0 ) imaging data with photometry for over 88 million unique objects , 367,360 spectra of galaxies , quasars , stars and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 2627 degrees of this area , and tables of measured parameters from these data . </S>",
    "<S> the imaging data reach a depth of @xmath1 ( 95% completeness limit for point sources ) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2% rms and 100 milli - arcsec rms per coordinate , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the imaging data have all been processed through a new version of the sdss imaging pipeline , in which the most important improvement since the last data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes for point sources , and petrosian magnitudes for extended sources . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopy extends from 3800  to 9200  at a resolution of 2000 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic software now repairs a systematic error in the radial velocities of certain types of stars , and has substantially improved spectrophotometry . </S>",
    "<S> all data included in the sdss early data release and first data release are reprocessed with the improved pipelines , and included in the second data release . </S>",
    "<S> further characteristics of the data are described , as are the data products themselves and the tools for accessing them . </S>"
