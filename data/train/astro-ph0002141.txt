    "however this is very unlikely as this hypothetical structure should in addition have a small column density ( no other fluorescent line is seen at that velocity ) _ and _ lie sufficiently close to the trapezium stars ( fluorescence varies as the inverse square of the distance to the continuum source ) .",

    "hogerheijde et al .  ( @xcite ) found velocities @xmath49   for different molecules .",
    "observations thus clearly imply that the lines could arise from the boundary of the  region .",
    "the narrowness of  and  allows the possibility to be excluded that the lines are excited by recombination in an ionized gas ( sect .",
    "[ identification ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath46 column density of the pdr is @xmath16  10@xmath50@xmath51 ( tielens & hollenbach @xcite ) , so the d@xmath46 column density is @xmath16  10@xmath52@xmath51 [ assuming a typical @xmath53 and the optical thickness in , ,  is over 100 . since the  emission is confined to a layer coincident in velocity with that of the pdr ( sect .  [ origin ] ) and since the dust opacity there is orders of magnitude less than the  opacity , fluorescence from the lyman lines is a viable process to produce the deuterium balmer lines .",
    "the uv continuum is dominated by @xmath10  ori  c , whose effective temperature is close to @xmath54k ( rubin et al .",
    "let us assume that both the ionization of the  region and the deuterium fluorescence are due to a @xmath54k black body and that half the ionizing photons escape from the  region in the matter bounded directions ( rubin et al .",
    "@xcite ) . if each photon impinging on the pdr at the  wavelengths ultimately produces a  photon by scattering on d@xmath46 , and only  photons lead to  excitation ( neglecting cascades ) , then the flux ratio @xmath55()/@xmath55 ( ) is about @xmath56 ) , where @xmath57 is the full velocity width of the zone where  is effectively excited .",
    "according to tielens and hollenbach ( @xcite ) , the turbulent pressure in the pdr corresponds to @xmath58  and according to table  1 , @xmath57 is probably less than 8  . the rather good agreement of this very coarse estimate with the observed value @xmath59 ( table  1 ) is fortuitous .",
    "this estimate may be wrong in different ways .",
    "many ly@xmath60 lines can a priori absorb primary photons and feed  by cascades , then leading to an overestimation .",
    "conversely , part of the ly@xmath60 photons are absorbed by dust and/or reflected back to the  region . also , our estimate is global in character and our particular line of sight may not intercept identical fractions of the  region and the pdr .",
    "most importantly , the stellar continuum may be depleted in the vicinity of the ly@xmath61 lines , particularly for the first members of the series .",
    "nonetheless , since these different effects tend to partially compensate one another , the above agreement indicates that the assumption of uv continuum fluorescence leads to the correct order of magnitude for the  flux .    unlike / , the flux ratio /  is little sensitive to aspect effects . assuming a ratio of visual extinction to column density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath62/@xmath6310@xmath64",
    "mag@xmath652   and @xmath66/@xmath67 ( tielens and hollenbach @xcite ) , the ratio of  opacity to dust opacity is @xmath16  240 . only for large principal quantum numbers should dust absorption decrease  fluorescence ( the photoexcitation cross section goes roughly as @xmath68 ) . since the stellar continuum should be about flat over the lyman line range ( except possibly in the vicinity of strong lines ) , some insight into the excitation process can be gained by assuming that all ly@xmath60(@xmath69 ) lines , with principal quantum number @xmath69 up to some given @xmath70 , convert identical numbers of uv photons by fluorescence and that no fluorescence occurs for @xmath71 .",
    "then , working out the cascades , the theoretical /  flux ratio is about 1.28 , 1.41 and 1.51 for @xmath72 4 , 5 and 6 respectively and tends to level off for larger @xmath70 s . only for @xmath73",
    "is this simple description compatible with the observed value @xmath74 ( table  1 ) . since one would expect that a relatively large number of ly@xmath60 lines should contribute to the excitation , the suggestion is that one of the above assumptions was oversimplified or some significant process has been overlooked .",
    "for example , the stellar continuum is probably depleted in the wings of the ly@xmath61 lines and the vicinity of  is likely to be most affected , then selectively reducing the  emission . observing higher deuterium balmer lines is essential before attempting any detailed modeling .",
    "note that the /  of table  [ lines ] was obtained assuming that the reddening correction was the same for the  and  emitting zones .",
    "if extinction internal to the nebula is significant , then the actual ( de - reddened ) /  ratio will be even smaller since the pdr , where the  lines come from , is more deeply embedded than the  region .",
    "dust absorption will dominate ly@xmath60 fluorescence for sufficiently large @xmath69 , the deuterium balmer decrement then changing from very flat to very steep .",
    "this break can lead to a d / h value inasmuch as the dust opacity per hydrogen nucleus is known . on the other hand , fluorescence lines from species",
    "co - extensive with d@xmath46 including and can provide independent information on the primary continuum flux and on the competition of line scattering with dust absorption for photons .",
    "fluorescence lines have been detected long ago in orion and the excitation process was established by grandi  ( @xcite ) .",
    "comparing  and  lines may lead to a d / o abundance ratio .",
    "detailed observations and proper modeling of many deuterium balmer lines and other fluorescence lines appear as a potentially accurate means to determine d / h in  regions .",
    "deuterium is identified for the first time in a nebula from optical spectroscopy .",
    "the excitation mechanism of the observed lines ,  and , is continuum fluorescence from ly@xmath60 lines in the pdr . considering the saturation of the first ly@xmath60 lines and the possible influence of the neighbouring ly@xmath61 lines ,",
    "observing the full deuterium balmer series is essential to obtain a d / h value from optical data and appears feasible , at least in orion .",
    "an optical determination of d / h in  regions would allow to check existing  values and obtain d / h in low - metallicity extragalactic  regions , where the deuterium abundance should be close to its primordial  value .",
    "the large photoexcitation cross section of the first lyman lines makes deuterium balmer fluorescence a sensitive way to _ detect _ deuterium in nebulae , leading for example to stringent upper limits to d / h in planetary nebulae ( hbrard et al .",
