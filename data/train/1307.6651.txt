    "it has been long assumed that turbulent magnetic diffusion ( or eddy magnetic diffusivity ) is an important part of the hydromagnetic dynamo process on the sun @xcite .",

    "the magnitude of turbulent diffusion impacts the period of the dynamo cycle , and the anisotropy of turbulent diffusion affects drifts of the large - scale magnetic field during the activity cycle ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations showed that the turbulent convection on the sun is anisotropic @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy results from influence of the global rotation on convective motions .",
    "it was shown that convective motions form `` banana''-like giant cells along meridians . in this case",
    ", the turbulent diffusivity in the meridional direction exceeds the diffusivity in the radial direction ( along the gravity vector ) .",
    "@xcite showed that such anisotropy brings the modeled propagation of solar dynamo waves in better agreement with observations .",
    "this fact was extensively used in various solar dynamo models @xcite .",
    "however , properties of the anisotropic magnetic eddy diffusivity , which depends on the impact of the solar rotation on convective motions , remains uncertain .",
    "results of theoretical calculations of magnetic turbulent diffusivity coefficients strongly depend on assumed models of background turbulent flows .",
    "mean - field magneto - hydrodynamics calculations show that anisotropy of the diffusivity coefficients is strong for the regime of fast rotation , when the coriolis number @xmath1 ; here @xmath2 is the angular velocity , and @xmath3 is a typical convective turnover time .",
    "this regime indeed can be found in the lower part of the solar convection zone . in the upper part , @xmath4 , and",
    "the anisotropy is small .",
    "furthermore , the numerical simulations , which are based on the test field method , ( see , e.g. , ) , confirm the analytical calculations of the rotation - induces anisotropy effects in the mean electromotive force , including the coefficients of the magnetic turbulent diffusivity .",
    "the global numerical simulations reveal a strong anisotropy of convection in the upper part of the convection zone , where , @xmath4 , ( see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "similar results are suggested by the nonlocal stellar convection theory @xcite.the origin of this effect is unclear currently .",
    "this anisotropy may self - consitently appear with the subsurface shear layer , which is generated in the models ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    in theoretical dynamo calculations",
    "this fact can be taken into account if we introduce an additional parameter to model the anisotropy of the background turbulent flows in terms of the relative difference of rms velocity fluctuations of radial and horizontal flow components ( eq . [ eq : anis ] ) .",
    "such approach has already been used in a mean - field model of solar differential rotation @xcite . in particular , the anisotropy allowed to explain the subsurface shear of the solar angular velocity . in our paper , we extend this idea and compute the magnetic diffusivity tensor for a range of the parameter of anisotropy .",
    "the calculations are performed using the so - called minimal @xmath0 approximation of the mean field magneto - hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "having in mind the previous results by @xcite and @xcite , we expect that the anisotropy due to additional horizontal diffusion of magnetic field changes the direction of the dynamo wave propagation and increases the horizontal scale of the mean magnetic field .",
    "we find that this effect decreases the overlap between the `` butterfly wing '' of the time - latitude diagrams evolution of the large - scale toroidal magnetic field , improving agreement of the dynamo model with observations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we shortly outline the basic equations and assumptions .",

    "we summarize the main results .",
    "some mathematical details are given in appendix .",

    "@xcite we assume that the mean fields vary over much larger scales ( both in time and space ) than the fluctuating fields .",
    "the governing equations for fluctuating magnetic field and velocity are written in a rotating coordinate system as follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the nonlinear contributions of fluctuating fields , @xmath15 is the fluctuating pressure , @xmath16 is the angular velocity , @xmath17 is a random force driving the turbulence . equations ( [ induc ] ) and ( [ fluc ] ) are used to compute the mean electromotive force , @xmath18 .",
    "details of the calculations are given in appendix .",
    "it is known that rotation quenches the magnitude of the turbulent diffusivity and induces the anisotropy of diffusivity along the rotation axis @xcite .",
    "similar quenching effect exists for the anisotropic background turbulent flows ( see , eqs[eqs",
    ": emfa]-[eq : phi3 ] ) . we found that both anisotropic and isotropic parts of the turbulent diffusivity are almost equally affected ( quenched ) by rotation .",
    "therefore , their ratio does not depend on the coriolis number . in a simple case , when we disregard the effect of the coriolis force the magnetic diffusion",
    "can be written as follows : @xmath19 where the first term describes the isotropic diffusion , and the second term describes the anisotropy .",

    "the model b , which has no meridional circulation , does not have equatorial branch of the toroidal magnetic field in the convection zone .",

    "this condition results to penetration of the toroidal field to the surface , which increase the efficiency of the subsurface shear layer @xcite .",
    "thus , the model can produce the equatorial drift of the toroidal field in the upper part of the convection zone ( above 0.9@xmath128 ) for rather small equatorial turbulent pumping , which operates in the bulk of the convection zone with amplitude less than 1 m / s ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "this is different to the model sugested by @xcite , who employed , in addition to subsurface shear , the strong turbulent pumping effects in the bulk of the convection zone .",

    "the model c3 , with the triple - cell circulation has in addition the equatorial migration near the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "the physical interpretation of these types of models suggests that poloidal field at the surface is produced directly from the buoyant flux tubes that come from the bottom of the convection zone . in this case the model with double - cell circulation is not solar - like .",
    "the model with the triple - cell circulation has a qualitatve agreement with observations , though the polar reversal of the radial magnetic field , @xmath129 , occurs about 5 years ahead of the maximum of the toroidal magnetic field , @xmath130 , in equatorial region .",
    "this model has the dynamo period as twice as large compare to the solar cycle in the case @xmath68 .",
    "for the case @xmath75 model c3 has the larger dynamo period about 30 yrs , though the phase relation between activity of @xmath129 and @xmath130 is in a better agreement with observations .",
    "we made addtional calculations for the distributed solar dynamo models like that discussed in subsection 2.3 including the effect of multi - cells circulation .",
    "for the case of the double - cell circulation we reproduced our results from the previous paper ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "we confirm the effect of the decreasing overlap between the subsequent cycles with the increasing parameter of the anisotropy @xmath20 .",
    "the case of the triple - cell circulation is found to be similar to the model c3 .",
    "however in this case the correct phase relation between activity of @xmath129 and @xmath130 holds only for the upper part of the convection zone , where similar to the model with double cell circulation we have the equatorial drift of the toroidal magnetic field because of equatorward flow of the meridional circulation .",
    "the results of that model are similar to results of the numerical simulation reported by @xcite .",

    "we found that the anisotropy affects the overlap time between the subsequent cycles .",
    "when the anisotropy is larger , the overlap is smaller .",
    "this effect is related to stronger concentration of the toroidal magnetic field near the bottom boundary of the convection zone due to anisotropy , and also as a consequence of a faster migration of the dynamo wave in the subsurface shear layer . in general , our model is consistent with the paradigm of solar dynamo operating in the bulk of the convection zone and `` shaped '' in the subsurface roatational shear layer .",
    "to compute the electromotive force @xmath132 for the anisotropic mhd turbulence we write equations ( [ induc ] ) and ( [ fluc ] ) in the fourier space :      where the turbulent pressure was excluded from ( eq.[fluc ] ) by convolution with tensor @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the kronecker symbol , and @xmath136 is a unit wave vector . the equations for the second - order moments that make contributions to the mean electromotive force can be found directly from eqs.([induc2 ] , [ navie2 ] ) .",

    "the double fourier transformation of an ensemble average of two fluctuating quantities , say @xmath148 and @xmath149 , taken at equal times and at the different positions @xmath150 , is given by @xmath151 in the spirit of the general formalism of the two - scale approximation @xcite we introduce `` fast '' and `` slow '' variables .",
