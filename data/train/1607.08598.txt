    "elucidating the connection between atomic structure and mechanical properties of amorphous materials is important for a variety of optical and structural applications  @xcite . unlike crystalline solids , where plasticity is determined by motion of topological line defects called dislocations ,",
    "an elementary process that leads to macroscopic plastic deformation of amorphous solids involves a collective rearrangement of a small number of atoms , often referred to as a shear transformation zone  @xcite .",
    "hence , the localized plastic activity in a deformed material is associated with large nonaffine displacements of atoms , i.e. , when atomic displacements do not match the macroscopic strain .",
    "surprisingly , it was found that spatial correlations of nonaffine displacements in steadily sheared amorphous solids are long - ranged  @xcite .",
    "recently , many experiments have been conducted to study shear - induced rearrangements of atoms and the yielding transition in glassy materials subjected to oscillatory shear strain  @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of spatial correlations of plasticity in glasses under periodic shear deformation remains not fully understood .",
    "0.05 in    in the last few years , a number of studies have investigated the mechanical response of amorphous solids to oscillatory shear strain using atomistic quasistatic simulations in the athermal limit  @xcite .",
    "it was found that at small strain amplitudes , the systems evolve into periodic limit cycles where particles follow the same trajectories over consecutive cycles , and the number of cycles to reach a limit cycle increases as a critical strain amplitude is approached from below  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , reversible avalanches of large particle displacements were observed at strain amplitudes below the critical value  @xcite . at finite temperatures",
    ", it was shown that the mean square displacement of particles exhibits a broad subdiffusive plateau during ten thousand cycles even at small strain amplitudes , and the relaxation process involves intermittent clusters of particles undergoing cage jumps  @xcite .",
    "it was also found that at the critical strain amplitude , the number of mobile particles involved in a correlated motion reaches maximum  @xcite .",
    "0.05 in    the shear transformation zones were directly observed in recent experiments on colloidal glasses under reversible macroscopic shear deformation and at mechanical equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the spatial correlations of the local strain field clearly showed the fourfold patterns , characteristic of eshelby inclusions , that are present even in a quiescent system where their orientation is isotropic , thus producing zero global strain  @xcite . in turn ,",
    "a local reversible shear transformation in a quiescent glass can trigger irreversible cage jumps whose density is large when the system dynamics is weakly damped or the shear transformation is slow  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a sharp transition from affine to nonaffine displacements of particles was identified in colloidal glasses under variable - amplitude oscillatory shear  @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that during periodic deformation of binary glasses , particles undergo repetitive nonaffine displacements whose amplitudes become more broadly distributed with increasing strain amplitude  @xcite .",
    "however , the spatial organization and correlations of nonaffine displacements as well as their occurrence in a quiescent system were not explored in detail .",
    "0.05 in    in this paper , molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study nonaffine atomic displacements in a three - dimensional binary mixture model subjected to slow periodic shear at a finite temperature .",
    "we show that the oscillatory deformation induces repetitive collective rearrangements of atoms that deviate significantly from the affine displacement field at large strain amplitudes .",
    "it is found that in a deformed material , the spatial correlations of nonaffine displacements are long - ranged , while they become short - ranged in a quiescent system , where nonaffine rearrangements are thermally activated .",
    "0.05 in    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the details of molecular dynamics simulations are given in the next section .",
    "the numerical results for the oscillatory shear deformation and quiescent systems and the analysis of nonaffine rearrangements of atoms are presented in sec.[sec : results ] .",

    "our three - dimensional system consists of @xmath0 atoms confined in a periodic box as shown in fig.[fig : snapshot_system ] .",
    "two types of atoms are considered , @xmath1 , which interact via the truncated lj potential as follows : @xmath2 , \\label{eq : lj_ka}\\ ] ] where the parameters are set to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the cutoff radius is fixed to @xmath9 . as usual , the units of length , mass , energy are set @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and , correspondingly , the unit of time is @xmath13 .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated using the verlet algorithm  @xcite with the time step @xmath14 .",
    "0.05 in    the atoms were initially arranged at the sites of the face - centered cubic lattice within a cubic box of linear dimension @xmath15 . throughout the study ,",
    "the density of atoms was kept constant @xmath16 .",
    "first , the system was equilibrated in the absence of deformation at the high temperature @xmath17 , which is well above the computer glass transition temperature @xmath18  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19 denotes the boltzmann constant .",
    "the temperature was controlled by the nos - hoover thermostat with the damping time of @xmath20 .",
    "then , the system was gradually cooled with a computationally slow rate of @xmath21 to the target temperature @xmath22 .",
    "this procedure was repeated for twenty independent samples .",
    "0.05 in    the periodic shear strain deformation of the material was applied in the @xmath23 plane using the lees - edwards periodic boundary conditions  @xcite , while the system remained periodic along the @xmath24 direction .",
    "the shear strain was varied as a function of time according to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the strain amplitude and @xmath27 is the oscillation period .",
    "the corresponding oscillation frequency is @xmath28 .",
    "we note that the streaming velocity was subtracted from the local particle velocity to compute temperature in the nos - hoover thermostat  @xcite .",
    "the system was subject to periodic deformation during @xmath29 cycles and the positions of all atoms were saved every @xmath30 .",
    "the analysis of nonaffine displacements was performed in twenty independent samples in the range of strain amplitudes @xmath31 during the last five cycles .",
    "the time - periodic deformation of an amorphous solid typically involves an alternating sequence of elastic strain separated by rapid plastic events , which are accompanied by sudden drops in stress and the potential energy  @xcite .",
    "depending on the strain amplitude , the local rearrangements of particles can be reversible after one or more cycles or irreversible leading to chaotic system dynamics and particle diffusion  @xcite . in our study ,",
    "the periodic shear strain is spatially homogeneous , which prevents the formation of shear bands during slow , nearly quasistatic , deformation period @xmath27 .",
    "0.05 in    the potential energy per atom is plotted in fig.[fig : poten ] for one representative sample , which was deformed during ten back - and - forth cycles at different strain amplitudes .",
    "the horizontal black line at @xmath32 corresponds to the potential energy measured in the quiescent system . note that for each curve , the superimposed noise is caused by thermal motion of atoms . at small strain amplitudes @xmath33 ,",
    "the minima of the potential energy at the end of each cycle remain unchanged , whereas at large strain amplitudes @xmath34 , the potential energy increases over consecutive cycles .",
    "these results imply that during periodic shear deformation at small strain amplitudes , the system dynamics is reversible after each cycle . in contrast , with increasing strain amplitude , @xmath34 , some atoms undergo irreversible displacements leading to a progressive increase in the potential energy .",
    "0.05 in    these conclusions are consistent with the energy landscape picture of sheared glasses ; namely , that a cycle of large shear strain rejuvenates the amorphous material by relocating the system to shallower energy minima  @xcite .",
    "depending on the annealing procedure , it was also shown that a cycle with a small strain amplitude overages the glass by moving the system to deeper energy minima  @xcite . in our simulations , the decrease in the potential energy after several deformation cycles is not observed at small strain amplitudes because of the computationally slow cooling rate that brings the system to an initial state with a very low energy minimum .",
    "0.05 in    in general , during an affine deformation of the material , the displacement of atoms can be described by a combination of a linear transformation and a translation .",
    "correspondingly , a deviation from the linear strain produces a finite nonaffine component of displacement of atoms with respect to their neighbors .",
    "the measure of the nonaffine displacement of the atom @xmath35 during the time interval @xmath36 is defined as follows : @xmath37 \\big\\}^2 , % \\label{eq : d2min}\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over @xmath38 nearest - neighbor atoms within the distance @xmath39 from @xmath35 , and @xmath40 is the transformation matrix that best maps all bonds between the @xmath41-th atom and its nearest - neighbors at times @xmath42 and @xmath43  @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "the quantity @xmath44 was computed every @xmath45 during each cycle with respect to zero global strain .",
    "0.05 in    in driven amorphous systems at finite temperatures , nonaffine rearrangements of atoms arise due to both external stresses and thermal fluctuations  @xcite .",

    "the quantity @xmath46 was averaged over all atoms in twenty systems at the maximum strain @xmath47 with respect to zero strain .",
    "it can be seen that in the quiescent system , when @xmath48 , nonaffine deformations are present but their distribution is relatively narrow and bounded by @xmath49 , which is comparable to the cage size @xmath50 .",
    "it should be noted that during the time interval @xmath51 , the motion of nearest neighbors is uncorrelated , and , therefore , the quantity @xmath52 essentially measures the average nonaffine rearrangement between two random configurations of atoms within their cages . to remind , in a dense amorphous system at the low temperature @xmath22 , most of the atoms in the absence of external deformation remain within their cages , or escape only temporarily , on the time scale accessible to computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "0.05 in    with increasing strain amplitude , the probability distribution becomes more skewed towards larger values of @xmath52 with the power - law exponent approaching @xmath53 at the largest strain amplitude @xmath54 , as shown in fig.[fig : d2min_pdf ] .",
    "the nonaffine displacements of atoms with @xmath55 reflect that their nearest - neighbor structure is significantly deformed during periodic strain .",
    "moreover , the power - law distribution of @xmath52 implies that highly nonaffine displacements are collectively organized , and , as will be shown below , they tend to form compact clusters .",
    "we further comment that the distribution functions shown in fig.[fig : d2min_pdf ] change continuously near the critical strain amplitude @xmath56 , which marks the transition from a slow relaxation dynamics with a subdiffusive plateau to a diffusive regime  @xcite .",
    "finally , it was also recently reported that the probability distribution function of @xmath57 , as well as other nonaffine measures based on displacement fluctuations and on deviation from the global deformation , exhibit a power - law decay with the slope @xmath58 in steadily sheared colloidal glasses  @xcite .",
    "0.05 in    next , we plot the variation of the quantity @xmath46 in fig.[fig : d2min_over_t ] during one oscillation period for the indicated strain amplitudes .",
    "the data were averaged over all atoms during the last five cycles . it can be observed that in the absence of external deformation , @xmath46 is finite and time - independent . as mentioned above , nonaffine displacements in a quiescent system",
    "arise due to thermal vibration of atoms within their cages , and their local configurations become uncorrelated over time intervals @xmath59 . since the mean square displacement of atoms within their cages is proportional to temperature , it is expected that @xmath60 scales as @xmath61 . furthermore ,",
    "as the strain amplitude increases , nonaffine displacements become more pronounced , especially near the maximum strain at @xmath47 and @xmath62 ( see fig.[fig : d2min_over_t ] ) .",
    "more importantly , the quantity @xmath63 after a full cycle is greater than @xmath64 at large strain amplitudes @xmath65 , which implies that some atoms undergo irreversible displacements during one cycle . in marked contrast , at small strain amplitudes @xmath33 , the nonaffine measure @xmath66 , indicating reversible dynamics .",
    "this transition correlates well with the increase in the potential energy over consecutive cycles at @xmath65 as shown in fig.[fig : poten ] .",

    "notice that in the quiescent system , there are only several isolated atoms , mostly smaller atoms of type b , with large nonaffine components ; although one group of atoms forms a small cluster [ see fig.[fig : snapshot_clusters](a ) ] . at the strain amplitude @xmath68",
    ", localized regions of highly nonaffine displacements can be observed in fig.[fig : snapshot_clusters](b ) . at larger strain amplitudes , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ,",
    "the clusters become interconnected and comparable with the system size .",
    "the appearance of repetitive clusters of atoms with large nonaffine displacements is consistent with reversible avalanches of particles rearrangements , which are associated with large drops in the potential energy , during periodic deformation of an athermal solid below the critical strain amplitude  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was also shown that energy drops are approximately power - law distributed in a 2d solid under oscillatory shear below the yielding transition  @xcite . in our simulations ,",
    "the cluster size distribution was not computed due to insufficient statistics , since only several large clusters are typically present in each independent sample  @xcite .",
    "0.05 in    a related analysis of the spatial correlations of nonaffine displacements , however , can be performed by considering the normalized , equal - time correlation function  @xcite given by @xmath71 where the brackets denote averaging over all pairs of atoms in twenty independent samples , and the quantity @xmath72 is computed at @xmath47 with respect to zero strain .",
    "the correlation function @xmath73 is shown in fig.[fig : corr_d2min ] for quiescent and periodically strained glasses .",
