    "the first examples of the low - temperature l- and t - spectral classes were discovered as companions to stars @xcite .",
    "the upper temperature limit for a y - type object is not known ; though it is expected to be @xmath8  k , when water vapor is predicted to condense ( see figure  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "wide - field searches for low temperature t ( and y ) dwarfs are currently in progress and several very cool objects have been found at temperatures of : @xmath9570  k @xcite , @xmath10  k @xcite , @xmath11  k @xcite , and @xmath12500  k @xcite . however , the spectra of those objects ( when available ) do not differ substantially from late t - dwarfs .",
    "an object comoving with wd  0806661 could represent the coolest substellar companion observed to date @xcite .",
    "while no spectrum has yet been obtained , this could very well be the first example of the y spectral class .",
    "this letter presents an upper limit at j - band to the substellar companion to wd  0806661 ( gj  3483 ) . because the ` wd ' designation is used exclusively for white dwarfs ( e. sion 2011 , private comm . )",
    ", we suggest the companion be referred to as gj  3483b rather than wd  0806661b , as adopted in the discovery paper @xcite .",
    "we will use gj  3483 and gj  3483b throughout this letter .",
    "we discuss what constraints our upper limit places on the object s mass and temperature as well as how it ties in to other imaged low - mass companions .",
    "this object , and similar low - mass companions , probably formed at large separations from their primary star via jeans - mass fragmentation @xcite rather than been scattered out via planet - planet interactions .",
    "as part of an ongoing imaging campaign to search for wide separation low - mass companions to nearby , old white dwarfs , we observed gj  3483 using the infrared side port imager ( ispi , @xcite ) on the ctio 4-m blanco telescope .",
    "observations were carried out on ut 2009 - 03 - 16 , 2009 - 03 - 17 , 2010 - 04 - 03 , and 2010 - 04 - 05 , each lasting 3240 seconds ( 3 sets of @xmath13 dithers with individual exposure times of 120 seconds ) and covering a field of view of approximately @xmath14 .",
    "conditions were generally good with seeing @xmath91  at j - band ( @xmath91.3  on 2009 - 03 - 17 ) and clear ( except for thin clouds on 2009 - 03 - 16 ) .",
    "data reduction was carried out in the usual manner using standard iraf routines .",
    "the brown dwarf companion observed by spitzer @xcite was not detected in any of the individual nights .    to obtain a deeper j - band limit , we coadded data from the four nights together . because the white dwarf has proper motion of ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) mas  yr@xmath17@xcite",
    ", we shifted the 2009 data by 1  pixel in both r.a .  and decl .",
    "to match the white dwarf s motion ( the ispi plate scale is 0.3  pix@xmath17 ) .",
    "individual nights were weighted by the square of the signal - to - noise of well - detected 2mass stars .",
    "our coadded , 3.5-hour image is displayed in figure  [ fig : image ] alongside the 2009 @xmath18 m spitzer field from program 60160 ( m.  burleigh ) and it is clear we do not detect the companion brown dwarf . to estimate a limiting magnitude , we generated synthetic stars in 0.1 magnitude bins ranging from j=20.6 to 22.6 using iraf / daophot s addstar routine with a psf derived from stars in our field .",
    "psf fitting was performed on these synthetic stars , which allows us to estimate a 3-@xmath0 limit of @xmath1 for this coadded exposure , 1.7  magnitudes fainter than the limit provided by @xcite .",
    "with our upper limit of @xmath1 , we estimate @xmath2>4.95 $ ] , nearly two magnitudes greater than the value quoted in @xcite and redder than any other t - dwarf currently known .",
    "figure  [ fig : m45 ] illustrates the trend of decreasing absolute @xmath18 m magnitude for known t - dwarfs as a function of @xmath2 $ ] color .",
    "our upper limit for gj  3483b is consistent with the t - dwarf trend , though it could be redder ( and , thus , as faint as @xmath19 ) . the initial - final mass relationships in ( * ?",
    "* and references therein ) along with the estimated white dwarf mass of @xmath20  @xmath21@xcite suggest the progenitor mass was @xmath22  @xmath21with a main sequence lifetime of @xmath23  gyr ( @xcite , and references therein ; s.  leggett 2011 , private comm . ) . with the cooling age of 670  myr derived in @xcite",
    ", this implies a total age of 1.5 to 2.7  gyr . based on our 3-@xmath0 limit , an age of 1.5  gyr , and theoretical evolutionary models from @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we estimate a mass of @xmath24  @xmath5and temperature @xmath25  k. however , with an age of 2.7  gyr , we find the companion has a mass of @xmath26  @xmath5and temperature @xmath27  k.    the irac 4.5@xmath28 m photometric magnitude of 16.72 @xcite can also be used to derive the mass and temperature of gj  3483b . with an age of 1.5  gyr , we find the @xcite models predict a mass of @xmath29  @xmath5and temperature @xmath30  k. with the upper age limit of 2.7  gyr , we find mass and temperature of @xmath31  @xmath5and @xmath32  k. these model temperatures are somewhat warmer than the value @xcite present ( @xmath33  k ) .",
    "while the uncertainty in age and thus the mass of gj  3483b are substantial , the range of implied masses is consistent with those anticipated from jeans - mass fragmentation ( see section  [ discussionwd ] ) .",
    "that is , the mass of gj  3483b is unlikely to be much smaller than @xmath34  @xmath5 .",
    "the range in mass and temperature ( @xmath35  @xmath5 , @xmath36  k ) for gj  3483b are comparable to those of cfbdsir  j1458 + 1013b ( @xmath37  @xmath5 , @xmath38  k ) , another recently discovered ultra cool companion @xcite .",
    "companions with masses less than @xmath920  @xmath5  have been imaged in only a handful of systems ( listed in table  [ tab : lowmass ] ) and most have masses between 7 and 15  @xmath5 .",
    "as described in @xcite , objects of mass @xmath915  m@xmath39 would require at least 2  gyr to cool down to @xmath9500  k , which is usually taken as the temperature in which the y - dwarf spectral type will appear .",
    "binaries with brown dwarf secondaries having masses larger than 15 m@xmath39 are somewhat more common than the few listed in table  [ tab : lowmass ] ( see table 2 in @xcite ) , but for a @xmath925  m@xmath39 object to cool to 500  k it must be at least 7  gyr old , according to the @xcite models . hence the coolest companions are more likely to be found in relatively old systems .    a handful of white dwarfs are known to host widely separated brown dwarf companions ( see table  [ tab : wdbd ] ) . while a few other wd+bd pairs are known , these are unresolved systems whose separations are a few au or less ( gd 1400 , @xcite ; wd  0137 - 349 , @xcite ) .",
    "the separations among the resolved wd+bd pairs is generally on the order of @xmath91000 s of au , albeit with low number statistics .",
    "companions around white dwarfs are expected ( and observed , see @xcite ) to have a bimodal distribution in their orbital semi - major axes @xcite .",
    "those orbiting close to the main sequence star will spiral in via tidal dissipation @xcite .",
    "more widely separated companions ( such as most of those in table  [ tab : lowmass ] ) will undergo orbital expansion following post main sequence mass loss from the white dwarf progenitor . assuming the mass loss was adiabatic , which is almost certainly true ( the orbital period is short compared to the time frame of mass - loss ) , the ratio of semimajor axes ( @xmath40 ) between the white dwarf and main sequence phases should be identical to the inverse ratio of white dwarf and main sequence masses , or @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , gj  3483 has a final mass of 0.62  @xmath21  and initial mass of 2.0  @xmath21 . if we assume the 2500  au projected separation corresponds to a semi - major axis , then while on the main sequence this binary would have had @xmath42  au , consistent with the values in table  [ tab : lowmass ] .",
    "the commonly accepted mass limits for brown dwarfs are 13 and 75  @xmath5 , where an object would fuse deuterium , but not hydrogen . in this case ,",
    "planets ( in addition to orbiting stars ) would have masses below @xmath913  @xmath5 .",
    "however , jeans fragmentation can produce gravitationally collapsing clumps with masses as low as @xmath97  @xmath5@xcite .",
    "typically , these fragments will have average separations of a few 100  au .",
    "as seen in table  [ tab : lowmass ] , there are several imaged systems with masses lower than @xmath915  @xmath5  that orbit their host stars at these wide separations .",
    "giant planets , on the other hand , can form via core accretion in a disk fairly close to the star @xcite or via gravitational instability at larger separations so long as the disk is sufficiently massive @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations , however , have shown that planet formation via core accretion does not generally occur beyond 35  au ( @xcite , but see also @xcite for contrasting arguments ) .",
    "gravitational instability could create massive planets at larger semi - major axes , but only for the most massive disks would one expect planets to form at @xmath9100  au ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowmass ] shows the separations and masses of low mass companions from table  [ tab : lowmass ] and extrasolar planets from the exoplanet orbit database @xcite .",
    "the population of exoplanets extends to lower masses and shorter separations ( semi - major axes ) , but is not displayed here . as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs , one would not expect giant planets to form at separations larger than @xmath43  au",
    ". however , it appears that for objects @xmath7  @xmath5 , companions are distributed in a wide range of separations , reaching as far as @xmath44  au .",
    "planet - planet scattering could conceivably eject objects out to these large separations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since lower mass planets are more readily scattered out to larger orbits than more massive objects , one would expect to see a larger number of low mass planets at large separations .",
    "however , numerous adaptive optics searches for companions have been performed , yet very few low mass objects have been found despite sensitivities to objects with masses @xmath45  @xmath5at separations @xmath4640  au ( @xcite ; and references therein ) . additionally , while many giant planets have been detected with radial velocity searches , there is a lack of @xmath47  @xmath5substellar companions within @xmath48  au , despite being sensitive to such objects ( the well - known brown dwarf desert , see @xcite ) .",
    "the paucity of low mass companions at large separations contrasts with both theoretical expectations and detected giant planets at @xmath49  au and suggests that planet - planet scattering is not a common mechanism to move large , @xmath7  @xmath5mass companions , such as gj  3483b and those listed in table  [ tab : lowmass ] , to large separations .    the low mass , directly imaged companions with separations @xmath50  au are worth mentioning , as they may be notable exceptions to jeans fragmentation :",
    "hr  8799b , c , d , e ; @xmath51  pic  b ; and 2m1207b . in the case of hr  8799 and @xmath51  pic , the planetary mass companions orbit relatively close to their a - type stars , which possess extended circumstellar disks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the brown dwarf 2m1207 also possesses a disk close to the primary ( @xmath52  au ; @xcite ) , but the low mass companion orbits beyond it at 46  au . while the disks around a - type stars can be massive enough to form giant planets at large separations , it is unlikely that a brown dwarf can possess a similarly massive disk .",
    "this suggests that , while low mass brown dwarf formation and planet formation operate on different scales , formation mechanisms for companions with masses @xmath53  @xmath5  begin to overlap ( see discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of additional low mass , widely separated companions will play a key role in our understanding of giant planet and low mass brown dwarf formation .",
