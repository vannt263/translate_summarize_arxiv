    "the experimental results provided by cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite with the 7 and 8 tev energies strongly suggested us that there is at least one isospin doublet higgs field .",
    "although this situation can be most economically explained in the minimal higgs sector with only one doublet assumed in the standard model ( sm ) , there still remain a number of questions regarding the higgs physics .",
    "first , we do not know what is the true structure of the higgs sector , i.e. , the number of scalar multiplets , those quantum numbers , and symmetries in the potential .",
    "second , what is the relationship between the structure of the higgs sector and the phenomena which can not be explained in the sm , e.g. , neutrino masses , the existence of dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe ?",
    "third , it is interesting to consider the decoupling property of the higgs sector , i.e. , whether the higgs sector has a non - decoupling or decoupling property . finally , what is the mass scale of the second higgs boson ?",
    "in addition to the above mentioned questions , there are many unknown things about the higgs sector .",
    "therefore , finding the answer for these questions , we obtain deeper understanding of elementary particle physics .    on the other hand , so far , many new physics models beyond the sm have been considered in various physics motivations . in",
    "most of the cases , the higgs sector is extended from the minimal form .",
    "for example , isospin singlet scalar fields are introduced in models with gauged @xmath3 symmetry  @xcite . in supersymmetric sms",
    ", we need at least two doublet higgs fields to give masses of sm fermions . the multi - doublet structure is also motivated to obtain an additional source of cp - violation  @xcite in the higgs sector which is necessary to realize a successful scenario of the electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an isospin triplet field is introduced , e.g. , in the type - ii seesaw model  @xcite and left - right symmetric models  @xcite .",
    "because a property of the higgs sector strongly depends on new physics models , _ higgs is a probe of new physics .",
    "_    how can we determine the true structure of the higgs sector ?",
    "there are basically two methods , namely , ( i ) a discovery of additional higgs bosons , and ( ii ) measuring deviations in higgs bosons couplings .",
    "although both methods are important to reconstruct the shape of the higgs sector , in this talk , we focus on the second one . in general , when we consider non - minimal higgs sectors , higgs boson couplings can be modified due to a mixing among neutral higgs bosons and vevs among higgs multiplets .",
    "these effects can happen at the tree level .",
    "in addition , higgs boson couplings can also deviate from the sm predictions by radiative corrections .",
    "in this talk , we first review basic experimental constraints to restrict the form of higgs sector .",
    "we then discuss deviations in the higgs boson couplings in several simple non - minimal higgs sectors .",
    "finally , we conclude this talk , and briefly introduce several works for radiative corrections to the higgs boson couplings .",
    "there are two important experimental requirements to constrain the form of the higgs sector , which come from the electroweak rho parameter and the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) .",
    "first , we discuss the constraint from the rho parameter . in the general higgs sector with a scalar field with the isospin @xmath4 , the hypercharge @xmath5 ( the electric charge @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 ) and the vev @xmath8",
    ", the rho parameter is given at the tree level by  @xcite @xmath9}{\\sum_i 2y_i^2v_i^2}.   \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the experimental data @xmath10  @xcite , higgs sectors with @xmath11 seem to be a natural choice .",
    "combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 which do not change @xmath11 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath12 when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are given to be half - integers , we obtain @xmath13 . if we allow to align vevs of several higgs multiplets , we can keep @xmath11 .",
    "the minimal realization of such an alignment is seen in the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite , where one @xmath14 and one @xmath15 triplets are introduced in the higgs sector .",
    "we can take two triplet vevs so as to keep the approximate custodial @xmath16 symmetry in the kinetic term as it is realized in the sm .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the alignment mechanism in the gm model has been generalized in larger higgs representations .",
    "if we introduce a higgs multiplet without satisfying eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) , and do not impose an alignment of vevs , a magnitude of such a vev should be tuned to be quite small as compared to the doublet vev .",
    "for example , if we consider a higgs sector with a doublet with @xmath17 and a triplet with @xmath14 , then the triplet vev is constrained to be smaller than about 3.5 gev at 95% cl  @xcite .    another important constraint to restrict the form of the higgs sector comes from suppression of the fcncs .",
    "for example , the @xmath18-@xmath19 mixing is successfully suppressed in the sm , because of the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism , and it appears via the one loop w boson exchanging box diagrams . however , when we consider multi doublet models , this virtue is lost , because in general , neutral higgs bosons contribute to fcnc processes at the tree level .",
    "this can be clearly seen in two higgs doublet models ( thdms ) as the simplest example .",
    "let us consider , e.g. , the down - type yukawa interaction in thdms which is given by ( flavor indices are neglected ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the higgs doublets , and @xmath23 is the left ( right ) handed quark doublet ( singlet ) .",
    "in the so - called higgs basis , the yukawa interactions are rewritten as @xmath24 where @xmath25 has the vev @xmath26 gev , three nambu - goldstone bosons , and a neutral higgs boson , while @xmath27 does not have a vev but includes physical higgs states which are not necessarily mass eigenstates . the original basis and the higgs basis",
    "are related by the orthogonal transformation as @xmath28 the two yukawa matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 are then related with each other by @xmath31 the mass matrix for the down - type quarks is obtained from the first term of eq .",
    "( [ yuk2 ] ) , so that the left and right handed quarks should be rotated so as to diagonalize the matrix @xmath32 .",
    "however , in general , the matrix @xmath33 given in eq .",
    "( [ mat ] ) is not diagonalized at the same time , because there is no reason why @xmath32 and @xmath33 are proportional to each other .",
    "therefore , flavor violating interactions are derived from the second term of eq .",
    "( [ yuk2 ] ) .",
    "such a situation can be avoided if only one of the doublets couple to the down - type quarks . in other words , when either a @xmath34 or @xmath35 term is forbidden , then @xmath32 is proportional to @xmath33 as seen in eq .",
    "( [ mat ] ) . by applying the similar procedure to the up - type quark and lepton sectors",
    ", we can define four independent types of yukawa interactions  @xcite so - called type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the definition of four types are given in table  [ types ] .",
    "the yukawa interaction terms are then given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 are the fermion mass matrices and @xmath39 factors are given in table  [ types ] the simplest way to realize such a situation is to impose a discrete @xmath40 symmetry  @xcite , where doublet fields are transformed as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and the types of yukawa interactions are determined by fixing the @xmath40 charges of fermions  @xcite , or an @xmath43 symmetry  @xcite . ] .",
    ".definition of the four types of yukawa interactions .",
    "for example , in the type - ii , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) couples to down - type quarks ( @xmath44 ) and charged leptons @xmath45 ( up - type quarks @xmath46 ) .",
    "the @xmath39 factors in eq .",

    "let us summarize remarkable points for @xmath47 and @xmath48 as follows :    1 .",
    "we can classify all the models into two classes , ( i ) models with universal @xmath48 ( @xmath51 ) , i.e. , the doublet - singlet model , the type - i thdm , the gm model and the doublet - septet model , and ( ii ) those with non - universal @xmath48 , i.e. , the type - ii , type - x and type - y thdms .",
    "2 .   in the doublet - singlet model , both @xmath52 and @xmath48",
    "are universally suppressed by @xmath53 .",
    "3 .   in the thdms , by taking the limit @xmath54  @xcite , both @xmath52 and @xmath48 become unity . in the other models ,",

    "therefore , precise measurements of @xmath67 and @xmath61 can be a powerful tool to determine the type of yukawa interactions .",
    "we have discussed deviations in the sm - like higgs boson @xmath0 couplings with the gauge bosons ( @xmath1 ) and fermions ( @xmath2 ) in several simple non - minimal higgs sectors with @xmath11 and without tree level fcncs .",
    "we have shown that characteristic patterns of deviations in @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings appear in each of higgs sectors as seen in figs .",
