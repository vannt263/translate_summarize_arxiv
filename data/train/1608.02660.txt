    "to observe the spooky dipolar correlations and @xmath30 interaction in the electronic groundstate of a moleular pair as proposed above , the discussion following eq ( [ 2ndorderdispersion ] ) suggests that one needs to find a molecule with two strictly degenerate groundstates that are coupled by the electric dipole operator  @xmath39such molecules are not easy to find .",
    "the idealized case of a strictly equilateral h@xmath0 molecule is one such case , as we show below .",
    "however , a literature search suggests that the h@xmath0 molecule is not stable in its electronic groundstate , and previous work found that the theoretical h@xmath0 conformation of minimum electronic groundstate energy would be a linear geometry , not a triangle .  in general , even where a candidate degenerate molecule for these effects is stable , one can exepect a jahn - teller effect to occur , whereby a fully isolated molecule will distort geometrically .",
    "we discuss these effects later on in this paper .",
    "for now we artificially hold the protons in the equilateral triangle conformation . the toy model that then results is very informative for present purposes .",
    "we can adjust the distance between the protons withn a molecule in order to explore regimes of weak and strong orbital overlap .",
    "we first study the simplest possible version capable of electronic dipolar excitations , namely three independent electrons moving in the coulomb potential due to the nuclei , with a basis consisting of only a single @xmath40 state on each nucleus .",
    "thus a distortion of the charge cloud on each nucleus is not possible , and the dipolar fluctuations that lead to the dispersion interaction between two such idealized molecules arise from hopping of the electrons between the localized @xmath40 states on the different protons of one molecule .",
    "( this will lead to the the pure  type - c non - additivity  phenomenon in dispersion interactions between such molecules , as proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "we first show that this non - interacting three - electron model for a single h@xmath0 molecule has 2 exactly degenerate electronic groundstates for each allowed spin configuration .",
    "for each spin configuration we further show that the two groundstates are coupled by the dipole moment operator .",
    "we will then use a limited configuration interaction ( ci )  approach to a pair of h@xmath0 molecules , leading to the spooky @xmath41 inter - interaction as described in general above . in the following section we",
    "will then show , by symmetry arguments and limited cicalculations , that these conclusions survive even when electron - electron interactions are re - introduced  and a larger basis is used .  in a further section",

    ", the doubly - occupied lowest - lying orbital @xmath107 contributes no electric dipole moment and so we can generate 2 alternative 3-electron groundstates @xmath108 with the same dipole moments as in eq ( [ dipolemoments ] ) : @xmath39@xmath109we can use ( [ gpmfromgupdown ] ) to write the correlated groundstate from ( [ phie ] ) in the form@xmath110this exbibits @xmath97 as a state with perfect anticorrelation between the electric dipole moments on the two h@xmath0 molecules . : when one is  up ",
    "the other is  down  , and vice versa  this perfect correlation does not decay with intermolecular distance @xmath6 , since the coefficents @xmath111 in the superposition ( anticorrelateddipolesstate ) are @xmath6-independent .",
    "this means that , although the @xmath1 decay of the vdw interaction here is same as for two fixed dipoles , this is different from that case because the interaction can be repulsive for fixed dipoles depending on orientation , whereas the present effect is always attractive in the dimer groundstate .",
    "it is a true van der waals interaction .",
    "it can also be compared with the non - decaying  spookycorrelations between spins or between photons in the study of quantum computing situations .",
    "the difference here is that the correlated entities are electric dipoles rather than electron spins or photons .",

    "the hamiltonian matrix ( [ hprimeab ] ) naturally has the same eigenvalues @xmath115  as the original matrix ( [ hab ] ) that used the + , - basis .",
    "our analysis above is quite consistent with the treatment of `` quantum electrical dipoles '' given by allen , abanov and requist @xcite .",
    "when the electron - electron interaction is included in the model of a single equilateral h@xmath0 , the interacting hamiltonian still has invariance under the 120-degree rotation operator @xmath117 and also under time reversal @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , just as for the independent - electron model above , we expect that there will be a degenerate pair of 3-electron states @xmath69 and @xmath70 that are analogous to non - interacting states defined in eq ( gandfstatesforindepeh3 ) .",
    "in particular they differ by a time reversal and are eigenfunctions @xmath117 with eigenvalues @xmath118 .",
    "( note that , since @xmath119 , the only possible eigenvalues of @xmath117 are the three complex cube roots of 1 )",
    ". the matrix element @xmath120 will therefore still be zero by the symmetry argument given above , and we expect @xmath121 will still be non - zero .  the question is whether these two degenerate states are still groundstates .",
    "we have set up a @xmath122 spin - restricted hamiltonian matrix including an on - site repulsion energy @xmath123 as well as hopping elements @xmath124 .  at fixed on - site repulsion @xmath123",
    ", we find that two time - reversed degenerate states @xmath125 and @xmath70 remain the groundstates for all positive @xmath47 except for @xmath126 exactly .",
    "for @xmath126 the three exactly degenerate groundstates have no double occupation of any proton site .",
    "we also verified explicitly that @xmath127however , as @xmath47 decreases towards zero , the gap from the groundstate doublet of each h@xmath0 unit , to the next state , goes towards zero .",
    "thus for small @xmath128 , corresponding to a uniformly stretched @xmath129 triangle , our two - state limited ci  analysis of the h@xmath79h@xmath0 becomes invalid .",
    "this means that when seeking real systems that exhibit the unusual vdw interaction ( phie ) , it would be best to look at ( e.g. ) clusters of metal atoms that favor hopping of electrons between nuclei , as suggested by the metallic nature of bulk metals .",
    "we also used molpro to study the equilateral h@xmath0 dimer system with a larger basis and all the electron - electron interactions , reaching the same qualitative conclusions as above .",
    "this calculation allows static and dynamic distortions of the electron density on each proton ( type - b nonadditive vdw effect @xcite ) , as well as the previously - considered  type - c ",
    "effects due to hopping of electrons between the protons .",
    "figure 3 shows the quantity @xmath130 versus @xmath131 separation @xmath6 , where @xmath132 is the binding energy of the @xmath133 dimer .",
    "results are shown for the t1.2 symmetry , which gives the dimer groundstate at all the @xmath6 values considered .",
    "two calculations were performed , one with a 1s - only basis and one with p orbitals in the basis as well .  in each case",
    "the curve becomes flat at larger separations , indicating that @xmath134 as predicted on symmetry grounds by the above theory .",
    ", both with an s - only basis and with an s+p basis .",
    "electron - electron interactions are retained within and between molecules in both cases ]    interestingly , the  @xmath1 interaction is stronger with the @xmath135 orbitals included , suggesting that the dynamic distortions of the charge cloud on each atom ( type  b  effect @xcite ) are assisting rather than hindering the type - c ( inter - atom hopping ) polarizability , in the present geometry .",
    "if the nuclear positions of a single isolated molecule are allowed to relax , the exact electronic degeneracy proposed here can lead to an energy - lowering jahn - teller distortion @xcite , causing broken rotational symmetry of the proton configuration in the groundstate .",
    "the electronic eigenstates proposed above will then be replaced by non - degenerate states with a dipole moment .",
    "this completely changes the situation for h@xmath136 which in fact is believed to be unstable  in its electronic groundstate , and if it were stable , would jahn - teller distort continuously to a linear configuration .",
    "thus our example of equilateral h@xmath0 is just a toy model requiring an external agent to hold the nuclear positions fixed .",
    "however in cases where the nuclear framework of a candidate cluster molecule is sufficiently rigid , such distortions will be small and will introduce only a small energy gap @xmath137  candidate systems for this situation might include transition or rare earth metal clusters where the observed enhanced rigidity of the bulk metal ( comapred to the simple s - p metals ) suggests that directional bonds may provide the needed structural rigidity , while the hopping @xmath47 tends to dominate on - site repulsion @xmath123 @xmath39(leading to full metallic behavior in the limit of a large number of atoms ) .",
    "metal atom clusters are only one possibility , however , and one could envisage many other possibilities for stiff structures with the required symmetry properties , based for example on the rigidity of graphene hexagons .    to commence exloration of the effects of the jahn - teller phenomenon , we therefore now investigate the simplest model with a static distortion , namely isosceles h@xmath0 with frozen nuclear positions .",
    "we will show that spooky vdw correlations can still occur in a significant subasymptotic regime of separations provided that the distortion - induced energy gap @xmath137 is small enough .",

    "so do a large number of cluster structures : for two examples see fig 5 .  of course",
    ", this combination of properties may not be the only way to achieve spooky vdw interactions , but it does suggest one class of molecules to explore .",
    "furthermore , our numerical studies of equilateral h@xmath0 showed that the hopping of electrons between sites needs to dominate over on - site coulomb repulsion in order for the two - fold degenerate groundstates states to be well separated from the first exicted state , as required for the validity of our limited - ci analysis of the inter - molecular interaction .",
    "these requirements suggest that clusters of metal atoms might be suitable candidates .    as an example of the importance of breaking inversion symmetry via an odd rotational symmetry",
    ", we also studied the square h@xmath279 molecule , which has discrete ( 90@xmath57 ) rotational symmetry and therefore has inversion symmetry , unlike equilateral h@xmath0 .",
    "we found no anomalous @xmath1 vdw interaction between two h@xmath279 molecules , though an always - attractive @xmath280 vdw interaction may be possible via spooky coupled quadrupolar fluctuations .",
    "this work will be described elsewhere .",
    "the jahn - teller - distorted state of our target molecules should have a permanent electric dipole , if the geometrical distortion is static , and indeed many quantum chemical calculations have predicted large static dipole moments for small metal - atom clusters ( see @xcite for example ) . experimentally these large dipoles are not seen , even at cryogenic temperatures where presumably thermal motions of the nuclei are less relevant.@xcite .",
    "this puzzle has attracted considerable recent attention and the current explanations involve nuclear motion ( pseudo - rotation ) whereby a small change in the distortion can produce a very different , sometimes opposite , dipole .",
    "recent work  within the born - oppenheimer approximation has suggested that the shapes of these clusters vary quite strongly over time @xcite at room temperature with both pseudorotation and shape - inversion present , while at 20k only the pseudorotation is present . at low temperatures these nuclear motions would be quantal , and when electronic degeneracies exist the motions may be anharmonic because of the conical intersection physics .",
    "indeed a proper treatment will require a description of the coupled vibronic motions of the electrons and nuclei , and in this regime one may speak of the dymamic jahn - teller effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "we tentatively suggest that the presence of a second such molecular cluster within the sub - asymptotic regime ( see ( [ defnsubasyregime ] ) ) can significantly affect these vibronic phenomena , leading to a coupling of the vibrational as well as the electronic motions of both molecules .",
    "if , during the course of these coupled motions at fixed intermolecular separation @xmath6 , the instantaneous electronic gap @xmath196 satisfies the subasymptotic criterion ( defnsubasyregime ) with significant probability , then one expects to see an anomalous @xmath1 vdw interaction similar to that discussed above for the sub - asymptotic regime of isosceles h@xmath0 .",
    "we first studied an idealized system consisting of two interacting equilateral @xmath129 molecules separated by distance @xmath6 , each molecule having frozen nuclear positions .",
    "we showed that this toy model exhibits ",
    "spookycorelations between the fluctuating molecular electric dipole moments .",
    "these correlations do not decay with increasing intermolecular separation @xmath6 , leading to a van der waals interaction energy falling off as @xmath30 @xmath39(see eq ( [ phie ] ) . rather than the conventional @xmath31 .",
    "this interaction occurs in the groundstate of the molecular dimer , and can be regarded as the zero - gap limit of the so - called  resonant interaction  , although the latter occurs only in an excited state when each molecule has a finite gap .",
    "this physics is only possible where each molecule has degenerate groundstates coupled by the electric dipole operator .",
    "we suggested that a class of molecules worth exploring for the existence of such a spooky vdw interaction are those with an odd number of electrons , with discrete ( @xmath281-fold rotational symmetry about an axis in its ideal maximally symmetric configuration , and that therefore break inversion symmetry in that configuration .",
    "equilateral h@xmath0 satisfies these criteria .",
    "h@xmath0 is unfortunately unstable , but there exist odd-@xmath241 clusters of metal atoms and other more rigid structures ( e.g. @xcite ) with equilateral ( three - fold , 120@xmath57 ) or five - fold , or seven - fold .... rotational symmetry etc . , and broken inversion symmetry . for two examples of such structures",
    ". these may be more stable against geometric ( jahn - teller ) distortions than h@xmath0 , and so may exhibit dipole - allowed transistions between nearly- degenerate groundstates",
    ". thus they may be candidates for a @xmath1 dispersion interaction , at least at sub - asymptotic separations ( see the criterion of eq ( [ defnsubasyregime ] ) for the sub - asymptotic regime ) .",
    "furthernore , clusters of metal atoms are promising because they tend to have large hopping amplitude @xmath47 between neighboring atoms , as evidenced by their ability to form highly conductive solids upon aggregation .",
    "these small cluster systems will tend to jahn - teller distort to produce large fixed dipoles , but such dipoles are not seen in experiments on metal atom clusters .",
    "the likely explanation lies in small nuclear motions that induce large fluctuating dipoles (  pdeudo - rotation  ) .",
    "we suggest that for dimers of these clusters , our novel vdw attraction would be mediated by coupled vibronic motions of both electrons and nuclei on both of the interacting molecules .",
    "if the molecules pass near the high - symmetry , electronically degenerate states sufficienly often during these combined motions , an appreciable weight of @xmath1 vdw interaction should be observable .",
    "the analysis in @xcite and in the recent work of requist , tandetzky and gross @xcite may be useful in analyzing this situation .",
    "we acknowledge conversations with bogumil jeziorski , tim gould , georg jansen and ryan requist .",
