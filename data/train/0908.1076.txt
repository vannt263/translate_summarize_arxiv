    "already back in 1978 , sandell _ et al._@xcite surveyed a wide range of alternative methods for decentralized control .",
    "they find that a good combination of engineering judgment and analysis can be used to define in a reasonable way an ad - hoc control structure for a dynamic system .",
    "they conclude that methodologies are needed that present a designer with several good control structure candidates for further consideration .    in this report",
    "we look at how research since 1978 has advanced distributed control .",
    "we consider the control of large - scale systems like power networks , traffic networks , digital communication networks , flexible manufacturing networks , ecological systems , etc .",
    "in particular , we survey some of the literature on model predictive control ( mpc ) in distributed settings",
    ". we will refer to this as _ multi - agent model predictive control_. we are interested in the control design methods that have been developed so far .",
    "the structure of this reported is as follows . in order to classify and find structure in the literature on multi - agent mpc , in section [ sec : cd ] we first consider control methodologies in general .",
    "control methodologies involve different kinds of models .",
    "depending on the actual models chosen , different issues rise that have to be considered . in section",
    "[ sec : sampc ] we focus on model predictive control ( mpc ) .",
    "we explain the general idea behind mpc and characterize the mpc framework in terms of the models of section [ sec : cd ] .",
    "as it turns out , the standard mpc framework may be seen as single - agent mpc . in section",
    "[ sec : mampc ] we move on to the discussion of multi - agent mpc .",
    "we refer to multi - agent mpc as a general term for methods that apply the mpc strategy using multiple agents to control a system .",
    "important aspects of multi - agent mpc are the way in which a system is decomposed into subsystems ( centralized , decentralized , hierarchical ) , the way in which control problems are formulated on these decomposed systems ( centralized , decentralized , hierarchical ) , and the way in which agents communicate with one another in order to solve these control problems .",
    "we describe how recent literature on multi - agent mpc implements these issues .",
    "finally , we end this report with open issues and concluding remarks in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we consider different types of concepts that play a role in general control methodologies .",
    "we consider the underlying task of control problems , system models that may be used for control , control problem models formulating a control problem , and agent architectures useful in solving control problems .          in a control context ,",
    "typically a system is supposed to behave in a certain way .",
    "it should accomplish some task , which may involve reaching a certain number of goals .",
    "the task has to be accomplished while making sure that any possible constraints are not violated .",
    "tasks may be provided by a human or some artificial entity , or they may follow from some behavioral characteristics or reasoning of the system .",
    "goals can be short - term goals , e.g. , to bring the system in a certain state , or long - term , e.g. , to maximize the long - term performance or to minimize the long - term operation costs .",
    "note that tasks need not have one single goal .",
    "they may have multiple , possibly conflicting , goals . in that case",
    "they are referred to as so - called _ multi - objective _ tasks .",
    "actions that can be performed on the system have to be chosen in such a way that the task of the system is achieved , keeping in mind the dynamics of the system , and possible constraints on the actions . finding the actions that achieve the goal",
    "is called the _ dynamic control problem _ ( dcp ) .",
    "a typical dcp setting is shown in figure [ fig : control ] .",
    "the general dcp can be formulated as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -- _ find the actions such that the goal is achieved optimally _",

    "note that the goal is independent of the model of the dynamic system .",
    "this section defines the elements that play a role in controlling a general system .",
    "as mentioned , controlling a system comes forth from having the desire to have the system achieve a certain goal . in order to obtain the goal we will assume that there is a _ system model _ of the system under consideration .",
    "such a model can be used to define more precisely what the goal is and to predict how the system will behave given certain actions .",
    "a _ control problem model _ defines what the exact control problem is , often based on the system model .",
    "a control problem model is used by agents that solve the problem .",
    "the agents are organized in an _ agent architecture _ and follow some _ communication protocol_.      dynamic _ system models _ describe the behavior of the physical system given _",
    "actions _ on the system , the _ state _ of the system , and possibly _ disturbances_. besides the dynamics of the system , there may be limits on possible actions and states .",
    "that is , the models are only valid in a certain operating area .",
    "these operating constraints may be due to technical limitations , regulations , safety measures , etc .",
    "system models may change over time .",
    "that is , the structural parameters of the model need not stay constant",
    ".    we can distinguish four different types of system models : _ centralized _ , _ _ decentralized__@xmath0_distributed _ , and _ hierarchical _ models .",
    "* we may model the system with _",
    "one system model _ , describing the whole system .",
    "this model may be very large if a high degree of detail is required , or very abstract if this is not the case .",
    "we call such a model a _",
    "centralized model_. e.g. , if we consider the system of a car , we can determine one single system model which describes the dynamics of the car completely . * in some cases , the overall system can naturally be seen as a _ collection of smaller subsystems _ that are completely decoupled from one another , or of which it is assumed that they are completely decoupled .",
    "each system is autonomous .",
    "we refer to a system model consisting of several smaller decoupled subsystem models as a _",
    "decentralized model_. e.g. , when we have a number of cars , the individual dynamics are decoupled and we have a decentralized setting .",
    "if we do have couplings between the subsystems , we have a _ distributed model_. e.g. , a car that has another car connected to it with a rope can be modeled as a distributed system .",
    "* we may also be able to distinguish system models with _ different layers of abstraction_. the highest layer may model the dominant characteristics of the system , whereas lower layers may model more detailed characteristics .",
    "information at higher layers is typically used in lower layers and vice versa .",
    "we can see a centralized model as a special form of a hierarchical model in which there is only one layer and one system model .",
    "also a decentralized model can be seen as a hierarchical model in which there is one layer with all the subsystems of the decentralized model and no higher layer . and finally a distributed model can be seen as a hierarchical model by defining a two - level hierarchy in which the lowest layer consists of the two subsystems , with links to a higher layer that connects the variables of one system to the other .      depending on the structure of the system model",
    "the overall goal may consist of one _ centralized goal _",
    ", a set of _ decentralized goals _ , or a set of _ hierarchical goals_. when using a centralized goal there is one overall goal for the whole system .",
    "decentralized goals appear when subsystems in an overall system each have their own independent goals .",
    "hierarchical goals arise when subsystems have goals that ( partially ) overlap , or when goals for a system can be defined on different levels of abstraction / detail .",
    "the goals typically have a close relation to ( part of ) the overall system .",
    "similar to the three different types of system models , we can define three types of _ control problem models _ :    * a _ centralized problem model _ consists of one single dcp . * a _ decentralized problem model _ consists of multiple smaller , independent , dcps . if the smalled dcps have no conflicting goals , the combination of the problems is equivalent to the overall dcp .",
    "however , if there are conflicting goals , the combination of the problems need not be equivalent .",
    "* a _ hierarchical problem model _ consists of a number of abstraction layers , in which higher layers contain more abstract dcps , and lower layers more concrete dcps .",
    "the higher layers depend on information from lower layers and vice versa .",
    "the structure of the problem model may be closely related to the structure of the system model . however , this need not always be the case .",
    "e.g. , we may have a centralized system model with a hierarchical problem model , or vice versa .",
    "solving dcps is done through the use of _ controllers _ , or _",
    "agents_. in general , agents are problem solvers that have abilities to act , sense , reason , learn , and communicate with each other in order to solve a given problem .",
    "agents have an _ information set _ containing their knowledge ( including information from sensing and communicating ) , and an _ action set _ containing their skills .",
    "agents may be organized in architectures , e.g. , through communication links .",
    "we can again distinguish three agent architectures :    * a _ centralized _ agent architecture , in which there is only one single agent , * a _ decentralized _ agent architecture , in which there are numerous agents that do not have any interaction among one another , * a _ hierarchical _ agent architecture , in which there are different layers of agents .",
    "higher layers may supervise and receive information from lower layers .",
    "lower layers may follow instructions from and provide information to higher layers .",
    "agents on the same layer may be allowed to communicate directly with one another , or through the higher layers .",
    "see figure [ fig : hierarchy ] for an example of a hierarchically structured agent architecture .",
    "note that communication between two agents on the same layer can be replaced by a virtual communication agent one layer higher in order to satisfy a no - communication - on - a - layer assumption .",
    "note that when considering hierarchical architectures , it is not only important to determine which information is communicable , but also in which order information is accessible to agents .",
    "that is , there needs to be a _",
    "communication protocol_.          the models introduced in the current section leave many questions when it comes to designing control systems .",
    "first of all , how should the system be modeled ?",
    "is there a logical subsystem structure ? can it be found from a centralized system model ?",
    "second , how should control problems be formulated on the chosen system model .",
    "third , how should the agent architecture be designed to solve the control problem ?",
    "more precisely , what acting , sensing , and communication skills should agents have in order to solve the problems ? according to what protocol should they communicate with each other ?",
    "sometimes the agent architecture already exists ; in that case the questions may be reversed : what subproblems can the agents solve ?",
    "how can the subproblems be designed in such a way that the overall goal of the system is obtained ? how should the subproblems be assigned to the agents ?    at a higher level we may consider agents clustered in groups .",
    "how can agents be clustered in groups such that the information exchanged within the group is maximized and between groups minimized ?",
    "similarly , how can the agents be clustered such that the combined skills in each group are sufficient to solve the combined subproblems of the group ?",
    "over the last decades mpc @xcite has become the advanced control technology of choice for controlling complex , dynamic systems , in particular in the precess industry . in this section",
    "we introduce the mpc framework .",
    "we relate the standard mpc formulation to the models introduced in the previous section and find that mpc can be referred to as single - agent mpc .",

    ", @xmath3 indeed reaches the desired set point @xmath4 . , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in terms of the previous section",
    ", the mpc formulation is based on a _ centralized system model _",
    ", with a _ centralized control problem model _ , and a _ centralized agent architecture_.    * the _ centralized system model _ is given by a ( possibly time - varying ) dynamic system of difference or differential equations and constraints on inputs , states , and outputs .",
    "* the goal of the control problem is to minimize a cost function .",
    "the control problem is stated as a single - objective optimization problem . *",
    "the problem is solved by a single _ centralized agent _ , the information set of which consists of measurements of the physical system , and the action set of which consists of all possible actions .",
    "the agent solves the problem with a three - step procedure , see also figure [ fig : mpc ] : 1 .",
    "it reformulates the control problem of controlling the _ time - varying _ dynamic system using a _ time - invariant approximation _ of the system , with a _ control _ and a _ prediction horizon _ to make finding the solution tractable , and a _ rolling horizon _ for robustness .",
    "2 .   it solves the reformulated control problems , often using general , numerical solutions techniques , while taking into account constraints on actions and states .",
    "it combines the solutions to the approximations to obtain a solution to the overall problem .",
    "this typically involves implementing the actions found from the beginning of the time horizon of the current approximation , until the beginning of the next approximation .",
    "since the mpc framework uses a single agent , we can refer to it as _ single - agent mpc_.    [ [ advantages ] ] advantages + + + + + + + + + +    single - agent mpc has found wide success in many different applications , mainly in the process industry .",
    "a number of advantages make the use of single - agent mpc attractive :    * the framework handles _ input , state , and output constraints _ explicitly in a systematic way .",
    "this is due to the control problem formulation being based on the system model which includes the constraints .",
    "* it can _ operate without intervention _ for long periods .",
    "this is due to the rolling horizon principle , which makes that the agent looks ahead to prevent the system from going in the wrong direction . *",
    "it _ adapts easily _ to new contexts due to the rolling horizon .",
    "[ [ disadvantages ] ] disadvantages + + + + + + + + + + + + +    however , the use of single - agent mpc also has some significant disadvantages :    * the approximation of the dcp with static problems can be of _ large size_. in particular , when the control horizon over which actions are computed becomes larger , the number of variables of which the agent has to find the value increases quickly .",
    "* the _ resources _ needed for computation and memory may be high , increasing more when the time horizon increases .",
    "the amount of resources required also grows with increasing system complexity . *",
    "the _ feasibility _ of the solution to dcp is not guaranteed .",
    "solutions to the approximations do not guarantee solutions to the original dcp .",
    "research in the past has addressed these issues , resulting in conditions for feasibility and stability , e.g. , using contracting constraints , constraint relaxation , and classical stabilizing controllers at the end of the horizon .",
    "most of the mpc research has focused on centralized computations . in the following section we look at research directed at extending the single - agent mpc framework to the use of multiple agents .",
    "using multiple agents to tackle the control problem may reduce the computational requirements compared to a single agent approach .",
    "in the remainder of this report we discuss the use of multi - agent mpc . as the name suggests , in multi - agent mpc",
    "multiple agents try to solve the dcp .",
    "although not strictly necessary , when considering multiple problem solvers , it is typical to have multiple different problems .",
    "the dcp is therefore typically broken up into a number of smaller problems .",
    "the main advantage of this is that the computational burden can be lowered .",
    "agents can communicate and collaborate with other agents to come up with a good solution .",
    "if the agents can work asynchronously then they can run in parallel and at their own speed .",
    "this is a desirable situation for control of large - scale systems .",
    "however , synchronization problems may be hard to solve .",
    "many authors have considered using mpc as part of a distributed control architecture .",
    "some examples of these are architectures in which a single mpc controller is used as replacement of decentralized pid controllers ( pomerlea _ et al._@xcite ) , multiple different mpc controllers are manually engineered as replacement of decentralized pid controllers ( irizarry - rivera _",
    "et al._@xcite , ochs _ et al._@xcite ) , or mpc is used as supervisory layer in a cascaded setting ( silva _ et al._@xcite , vargas - villamil _",
    "et al._@xcite ) .",
    "the control architectures involved are typically engineered with insight in the specific application domain .",
    "other architectures consider multiple subsystems that depend on one another , and that employ mpc in order to optimize system performance .",

    "we can characterize the multi - agent mpc framework as follows :    * the system model is typically a _ hierarchical system model_. * the control problem is typically formulated to minimize a _ hierarchical",
    "_ cost function . *",
    "the control problems are typically solved by a _",
    "hierarchical agent architecture_.    in multi - agent mpc , the centralized system and control problem are first _ decomposed _ into smaller subproblems .",
    "the subproblems will in general depend on each other . to solve the problems the agents therefore need to _ communicate _ with each other .",
    "in this section we survey some of the approaches recent research has taken for decomposing the dcp into sub - dcps and finding a suitable solution to those .",
    "we are particularly interested in seeing how different authors decompose the overall system into subsystems , how they define the subproblems , and how agents communicate with each other to come to a solution .",
    "typically there are two ways in which a decentralized or hierarchical system model is formed , based on the way the overall system is considered :    * the centralized system model can be used _",
    "explicitly_. in this case , a _ centralized _ system model is first _ explicitly _ constructed and then decomposed into several subsystems using structural properties that are present in the system model .",
    "this is a _ top - down _ approach .",
    "e.g. , motee and sayyar - rodsari @xcite , and katebi and johnson @xcite analytically decompose a linear dynamic system into an equivalent set of subsystems with coupled inputs .",
    "* the centralized system model can also only be considered _",
    "implicitly_. this means that the decomposition into subsystems is based on engineering insight and typically involves modeling a subsystem and the relations with other subsystems directly . in this case",
    "we have a _ bottom - up _ approach .",
    "e.g. , georges @xcite , el fawal _",
    "et al._@xcite , braun _ et al._@xcite , and gmez _ et al._@xcite design the subsystems without first considering a model for the overall system .    in general , as sandell _",
    "et al._@xcite point out in their survey , dividing a system into subsystems may be done by considering different time scales in a system and looking for weak couplings between subsystems . by our knowledge",

    "however , many authors do use the word _ decentralized _ to address a group of subsystems that can communicate with one another .",
    "we see this group of subsystems as a special case of a hierarchical system model .",
    "purely decentralized model decomposition only is possibly when two subsystems are completely independent of each other , or when they are _ assumed to be _ independent of each other .",
    "the term _ decentralized _ should not be confused with the more general term _ distributed_. the latter refers to systems consisting of subsystems in general , and not in particular to systems consisting of strictly independent subsystems .",

    "the coupling between subsystems can have different foundations :    * sometimes the coupling is based on _ physical variables _ and modeled explicitly , like in sawadogo _ et al._@xcite .",

    "et al._@xcite consider optimal dynamic routing of messages in a store - and - forward packet switching network .",
    "the nodes in the network are seen as subsystems with connections to neighboring subsystems . in particular , by reformulating the subsystem model they get rid of constraints . *",

    "however , in multi - agent mpc there are alternatives since an agent may accept _ suggestions _ from neighboring agents regarding its actions .",
    "these suggestions could be , e.g. , values to set :    * an agent may _ exclusively _ choose its action and implement it , e.g. , by simply choosing the first action taken from the sequence of optimal actions",
    ". georges @xcite and el fawal _ et al._@xcite consider a higher - layer agent that obtains information from multiple lower layers to exclusively update parameters for each agent .",

    "other agents may be allowed to use capabilities of a certain agent that only that agent has .",
    "* agents may choose which action to perform in a _ democratic _ way by letting multiple agents vote about which action to take .",
    "camponogara @xcite shows that this can be beneficial , assuming that the majority knows what is right to do .",

    "sometimes a protocol may however to some extent require the modification of the subproblems .",
    "it may demand    * the reformulation of subproblems as _ unconstrained _ subproblems , that is , to remove all limits , * the _ relaxation _ of subproblems with tolerance factors , that is , to allow going over certain limits , * _ tightening _ of subproblems with resource factors , that is , to lower the limits as much as possible .    in particular when asynchronously working agents are considered , these modifications may be needed . as an example , each agent needs to know what the other agents might want to do , so it can anticipate these actions if it chooses to be unselfish .",
    "shared resources need to be shared in ways that seem fair .",
    "however , faster agents may grab all the resources .",
    "resource factors may help here .",

    "learning can for example be introduced for _ parameter identification _ , or for _ improvement of problem - solving _ and _ decision - making _ abilities . learning may enable an agent to predict what its neighbors will do .",
    "learning is in particular useful when agents work asynchronously .",
    "georges @xcite and katabi _",
    "et al._@xcite include an on - line identification procedure based both on a mimo parametrized model of the physical characteristics of the system and kalman filtering . besides that the authors use a kalman optimal estimator defined on the basis of the on - line identified control to estimate the state of the subsystems over which the subproblem of an agent is defined .",

    "the collection of the solutions for all possible actions of its neighboring agents constitute its reaction set .",
    "the intersection of the reaction sets of all agents identify the nash equilibria .",
    "the calculation of a reaction set requires the repeated solution of the subproblems , which can be tedious .    depending on the cooperation scheme used , the resulting performance will be different . when considering multi - agent mpc it is important to look at the question whether or not the agents are capable of cooperatively obtaining an optimal solution to the overall control problem .",
    "in @xcite , camponogara _ et al .",
    "_  consider under what conditions iterations converge to a solution of the subproblems and under what conditions the solutions of the subproblems compose a solution to the overall problem .",
    "et al._@xcite remark that team - optimal control problems can be solved analytically in very few cases , typically when the problem is lqg and the information structure is partially nested , i.e. , when any agent can reconstruct the information owned by the decision makers whose actions influenced its personal information .",
    "et al._@xcite address the problem of the existence of multi - agent mpc stationary control strategies in an lqg decentralized setting .",
    "the possibility of applying a multi - agent mpc control scheme derives from the assumptions on the information structure of the team .",
    "the authors of @xcite show how applications of such a scheme generally yield time - varying control laws , and find a condition for the existence of stationary multi - agent mpc strategies , which takes only a - priori information about the problem into account .",
    "dunbar and murray @xcite establish that the multi - agent mpc implementation of their distributed optimal control problem is asymptotically stabilizing .",
    "the communication requirements between subsystems with coupling in the cost function are that each subsystem obtains the previous optimal control trajectory of the other subsystems to which it is coupled at each receding horizon update .",
    "the authors of @xcite note that the key requirement for stability is that each action sequence computed by the agents does not deviate too far from the sequence that has been computed and communicated previously .",
    "camponogara _ et al._@xcite develop conditions on the agents problems and cooperation protocols that ensure convergence to optimal attractors . unfortunately , they find that the conditions have some severe disadvantages for practical use :    * the convexity of the overall objective function and constraints can not be guaranteed in practice .",
    "the dynamics of real - world networks can be highly nonlinear and nonconvex . *",
    "the protocols developed in @xcite require that the initial solution is feasible .",
    "this feasibility is hard to meet .",
    "the specifications on how the network should behave in the future can introduce conflicts and make the problem infeasible .",
    "the resolution of the conflicts stands as a hard problem . *",
    "the differentiability of the objective and constraint functions can not be expected in real - world problems .",
    "when the decisions are a mix of discrete and continuous variables , non - differentiability is introduced in the functions .",
    "the protocols developed in @xcite can not deal with this . *",
    "the exact match of agents to subproblems is impractical .",
    "this means that each subproblem has a specific agent capable of obtaining the information and making the actions needed to solve the subproblem .",
    "the agent architectures could become too dense to induce an exact match .",
    "* the protocols developed in @xcite use interior - point methods .",
    "the use of these methods is not convenient since interior - point methods are sensitive to implement and less robust than algorithms such as sequential quadratic programming . *",
    "the enforcement of serial work within neighborhoods is quite impractical and unattractive .",
    "the convergence speed would be very slow and therefore the network of agents would not respond promptly to disturbances .    although these issues may be difficult to remove , camponogara _ et al . _",

    "this allows us to identify directions for further research .",
    "although since the survey paper of 1978 by sandell",
    "_ et al._@xcite a significant amount of progress has been made , many issues remain to be investigated .",
    "some of these are :    * the decomposition of system models and control problems may be automated .",
    "methods could be developed that propose different decompositions .",
    "* in the current literature only one or two layers are considered .",
    "it is not clear how hierarchies with more layers can be automatically used .",
    "perhaps more layers can be used in similar ways or with some form of nesting .",
    "* the assignment of subproblems to agents may be automated .",
    "perhaps agents can negotiate about who solves which subproblem .",
    "the assignment should be efficient , robust , etc . *",
    "the conditions for convergence to optimal solutions to the overall problem are too restrictive for practical application .",
    "perhaps classes of systems or control problems could be identified in which multi - agent mpc may have fewer conditions for convergence . * until these classes have been identified , heuristic coordination schemes need to be developed that give good results .",
