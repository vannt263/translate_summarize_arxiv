    "various cosmological observations such as type - ia supernovae ( snia )  @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb )  @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao)@xcite indicate that our universe is currently under an accelerating expansion , which is known as the dark energy problem .",
    "on the other hand , there are some cosmological problems in which the hot big bang model can not be explained , such as the horizon , flatness and monopole problems .",
    "a rapid accelerating expansion era , known as inflation , is introduced right after the beginning of the universe to provide a graceful solution to these problems  @xcite . as a result",
    ", our universe has gone through two different eras of the accelerating expansion : inflation and late - time acceleration .",
    "it is well known that the simplest way to realize the late - time acceleration is to introduce a cosmological constant into the einstein equation .",
    "the corresponding theory is referred to as the @xmath5cdm model , which fits with the observational data very well , and becomes the standard model of cosmology .",
    "however , there exists several unnatural properties in this model , such as coincident and hierarchy problems . in order to remove these problems ,",
    "people have tried various methods .",
    "one of which is to introduce a homogeneous and isotropic energy density with a negative pressure into the theory of general relativity ( gr ) , and the other one is to modify the einstein s gravity theory  @xcite . among them , @xmath1 gravity is one of not only the minimal extension of the @xmath5cdm model , but also the most efficient theory to explain inflation and dark energy . to describe the late - time accelerating phenomenon ,",
    "several viable @xmath1 viable models have been proposed to satisfy the constraints from theoretical considerations and cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "these viable @xmath1 models can be classified into power - law and exponential types  @xcite . under these viable conditions ,",
    "the future singularities have been removed and the instability of cosmological perturbation never occurs in the universe .",
    "additionally , there still exists a broad window of experimental tests by space gravitational wave detections  @xcite . through the markov chain monte carlo method ( mcmc )",
    "analysis , the viable @xmath1 dark energy models get a smaller likelihood than that in the @xmath5cdm model , denoting that they are preferred by cosmological observations  @xcite . besides the dark energy problem",
    ", @xmath1 gravity is also used to address the dark matter problem  @xcite as well as the inflation scenario . in this manuscript",
    ", we will focus on the viable @xmath1 models with dark energy and inflation .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath6 inflation , first proposed by starobinsky  @xcite , successfully describes the reheating period  @xcite and predicts a tiny tensor - to - scalar ratio , which is consistent with the observations today  @xcite . since both @xmath1 gravity and @xmath6 inflation achieve their goals by modifying the action of general relativity to a function of ricci scalar , it is tempting to consider their actions together to provide a unified framework for both inflation and the late - time acceleration epoch .",
    "in fact , the @xmath6 model remains one of the most attractive models today describing inflation because it solves the singularity problems when combined with @xmath1 dark energy models  @xcite .    as a simple generalization of the @xmath6 inflation , many people  @xcite have investigated the possibility of the power in @xmath6 to deviate slightly from two , named the @xmath0 inflation , where @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0 inflation has been shown to be compatible with observations and predicts a larger scalar - to - tensor ratio than that in the @xmath6 inflation .",
    "it is thus natural to combine the @xmath0 inflation model with viable @xmath1 dark energy models to ensure the late - time acceleration of our universe . as an example , a recent attempt of combining these two has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we would like to study the constraints on the combined inflation with dark energy models .",
    "the action includes the early universe @xmath0 inflation and late - time @xmath1 dark energy of the starobinsky  @xcite and exponential gravity  @xcite models , which belong to the power - law and exponential types , respectively .",
    "we modify the code for anisotropies in the microwave background ( camb )  @xcite and the cosmological montecarlo ( cosmomc ) package  @xcite to study the constraints on inflation as well as @xmath1 dark energy models from the cosmological observations , including those of the cmb data from planck  @xcite and wmap  @xcite , bao data from baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss )  @xcite and snia data from supernova legacy survey ( snls )  @xcite . since the mgcamb program ( modification of growth with camb )  @xcite uses the parametrized framework to include @xmath1 gravity into camb",
