    "<S> this pinning crossover field is observed to decrease with increasing temperature ( not shown ) , which is consistent with the cuprate ybco reported in ref ..    figure[fig : figure5]a compares @xmath60 for p - doped ba-122 on ibad - mgo for @xmath19 at 4.2k with p - doped ba-122 on mgo single crystalline substrate@xcite , fe(se , te ) on rabits@xcite , ybco coated conductor@xcite , mgb@xmath3@xcite , nbti@xcite , and nb@xmath1sn@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pinning - improved ybco 2nd - generation ( 2 g ) tape shows the highest @xmath5 at entire magnetic fields ; however , a well textured template is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> the p - doped ba-122 coated conductor exceeds a self - field @xmath5 of 4ma/@xmath7 and maintains a high @xmath5 value of 50ka/@xmath7 at 20 t . </S>",
    "<S> for the entire field range , @xmath5 of p - doped ba-122 coated conductor sample is larger than for mgb@xmath3 and nbti . above 20 t , </S>",
    "<S> the p - doped ba-122 coated conductor sample shows comparable properties to nb@xmath1sn . </S>",
    "<S> although lower - field @xmath5 of p - doped ba-122 on ibad - mgo is higher than that of fe(se , te ) on rabits , the latter shows the better performance at medium and high fields . </S>",
    "<S> figure[fig : figure5]b summarises @xmath60 for p - doped ba-122 on ibad - mgo for both crystallographic directions at various temperatures . at intermediate fields </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 for the two directions is comparable , indicative of the presence of correlated pinning along the @xmath31-axis .    by analysing the pinning force density @xmath81 , information on vortex </S>",
    "<S> pinning can be obtained . in general , the normalised pinning force , @xmath82 , is plotted as a function of reduced field @xmath83 at a given temperature for high-@xmath0 superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> however , we plot @xmath84 as a function of @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the field at which @xmath87 shows the maximum@xcite , since @xmath5 could not be measured up to @xmath14 at all temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen in fig.[fig : figure5]c , the @xmath84 curves at different temperatures for @xmath19 almost fall onto a master curve in the range of @xmath88 described by    @xmath89    this formula is analogous to @xmath90 ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) found by dew - hughes@xcite for pinning by planar defects such as gb and twin boundaries , and by kramer for line defect arrays@xcite . in high-@xmath0 superconductors with extremely short coherence lengths @xmath93 , a further classification of the defect size with respect to @xmath93 is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently found by paturi @xmath9 @xmath94 that the exponent @xmath95 is 0.5 irrespective of @xmath96 for a defect size of the order of @xmath93 and especially for dislocations in undoped ybco films@xcite . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath95 increases towards 1 with increasing defect size . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the finding that pinning in our sample is dominated by the dislocations with nano - size . here </S>",
    "<S> , it should be noted that a sign of nold signature does not contradict gb pinning . </S>",
    "<S> in fact it has been reported for ybco that the dislocations in gbs can work as vortex pinning centres@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the flux preferentially flows across the dislocation cores in the gb plane , which explains the @xmath8 curves with nold sign .    </S>",
    "<S> abrikosov - josephson vortices ( ajv ) are present in low - angle gbs in both ybco@xcite and fbs . </S>",
    "<S> unlike josephson vortices ( jv ) , ajv have normal cores and can be trapped by flux pinning . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the presence of an interaction between abrikosov vortices ( av ) in the grain and ajv at the gbs has been experimentally found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> : an increase in pinning potential for av leads to the enhancement of the pinning potential for ajv .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath45 the @xmath84 curves at both 10 and 15k follow well the gb pinning line ( red solid line ) up to 16 t ( corresponding to @xmath97 and 3.2 in fig.[fig : figure5]d , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath84 at 20k neither follows the gb pinning nor point - like pinning ( red solid and blue dashed lines , respectively ) in high field regime , although the @xmath84 curve lies on the gb pinning line below @xmath98 . similarly , the @xmath84 curve at 4.2k follows the gb pinning curve up to @xmath99 and then approaches the point - like pinning curve beyond @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , differently from the @xmath19 case , the dominant pinning mechanism for @xmath45 is varying with temperature and field strength .    </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence of the critical current density , @xmath75 ( fig[fig : figure6]a - d ) , shows two distinct peaks : a relatively sharp peak at @xmath45 and a broad maximum at @xmath19 , which arises from the network of threading dislocations comprising the low - angle gbs@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the @xmath31-axis peaks [ @xmath101 remain visible even close to @xmath14 at all temperatures . unlike single band superconductors , the anisotropy of coherence length , @xmath102 , and penetration depth , @xmath103 , of fbs exhibit opposite behaviour with temperature@xcite . for an optimally doped ba-122 system </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath104 holds at all temperature . in this case even occasional uncorrelated defects slightly larger than @xmath93 yield a strong @xmath31-axis pinning@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an effect in combination with threading dislocations along the @xmath31-axis may enhance enormously the average pinning potential for applied fields parallel to the @xmath31-axis .    </S>",
    "<S> shown in fig.[fig : figure6]e is the scaling behaviour of @xmath75 as a function of the effective field [ i.e. , @xmath105 at 20k . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 and @xmath71 were used as obtained by the @xmath53 fit . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen , all @xmath75 curves collapse onto a master curve in a wide angular range around @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> differences between the master curve and the measured @xmath60 for @xmath19 are correlated pinning contributions . </S>",
    "<S> here we emphasise that the @xmath5 peak at @xmath65 is fully determined by the electronic anisotropy at 20k and no intrinsic pinning or pinning by planar defects is observed .      in order to realise </S>",
    "<S> fbs coated conductors , high @xmath5 values with low anisotropy in high fields are necessary . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 of our p - doped ba-122 coated conductor nearly reached the practical level of @xmath1060.1ma/@xmath7 at 15 t for any applied field directions at 4.2k [ see fig.[fig : figure5]a ) ] , which shows superior properties over mgb@xmath3 and nbti . above 20 t </S>",
    "<S> the level of @xmath5 is comparable to nb@xmath1sn . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the intrinsic anisotropy estimated at 20k from the @xmath4 data is below 2 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the correlated defects increase @xmath5 for @xmath19 substantially suppressing the effective @xmath5 anisotropy .    as stated above </S>",
    "<S> , the inequality of @xmath93 and @xmath107 anisotropy in combination with a large density of threading dislocations along the @xmath31-axis significantly enhances the average pinning potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that the population of threading dislocations can be controlled by the processing conditions only , without any modification of the pld target@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> compared to optimally p - doped ba-122 films on mgo single crystal substrates by mbe@xcite and pld@xcite , the level of @xmath5 of the p - doped ba-122 coated conductor still needs to be improved . </S>",
    "<S> film stoichiometry especially for p content should be controlled precisely . as stated before , the p content of our ba-122 film slightly differs from the optimal level , where the qcp causes a sharp maximum for the vortex core energy@xcite . as a consequence , the slight deviation from the optimal p level in our sample results in a lower vortex core energy , which directly reduces @xmath5 .    unlike in electron and hole doped ba-122 systems , aliovalent disorder that contributes to pinning in the co or k cases is absent in p - doped ba-122 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath5 can be further enhanced by introducing growth defects ( e.g. intragrain dislocations since the pld processing conditions strongly affect their density@xcite ) and artificial structures ( e.g. nanoparticles ) </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the thermal conductivity of single crystalline mgo is different from that of ibad - mgo template , which infers the optimum deposition temperature may change .    </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of artificial pinning centres is effective for further improvement of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , miura @xmath9 @xmath94 have reported the introduction of bazro@xmath1 into p - doped ba-122 matrix@xcite in analogy to the addition of bazro@xmath1 to ybco . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a combination of the introduction of artificial pinning centres and the precise control of p content will yield better performing p - doped ba-122 coated conductors .    </S>",
    "<S> an attempt to fabricate a long length p - doped ba-122 coated conductor has started quite recently . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> a 15 cm long p - doped ba-122 coated conductor has been realised by pld using a reel - to - reel system@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> albeit the resultant p - doped ba-122 showed a small self - field @xmath108 of 0.47ma ( corresponding to a @xmath5 of @xmath109 ) at 4.2k , an improvement of @xmath108 is foreseen by applying the aforementioned methods .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated in - field transport properties of a p - doped ba-122 thin film grown by pld on technical substrate in a wide range of temperature and dc magnetic field up to 35 t . </S>",
    "<S> the p - doped ba-122 coated conductor exceeds a transport @xmath5 of @xmath6a/@xmath7 at 15 t for both major crystallographic directions of the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the @xmath5 peaks for @xmath19 remain visible even close to @xmath14 at all temperatures by the enhanced vortex pinning due to the combination of large population of threading dislocations and the inequality of @xmath93 and @xmath107 anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a lower @xmath5 anisotropy . by analysing pinning force densities , we established that the gb pinning contribution is dominant for @xmath19 , whereas for @xmath45 , the dominant pinning is varying with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained through this study are considered promising for future high - field - magnet applications of @xmath2 - 122 systems . </S>"
