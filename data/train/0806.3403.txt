    "understanding the transport properties of particles moving in fluid flows and subject to molecular diffusion is a problem of great theoretical and practical importance @xcite with applications in , for example , atmosphere , ocean science and chemical engineering  @xcite . in the case where inertial effects can be neglected ,",
    "the equation of motion for the particle is @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a standard @xmath3-dimensional brownian motion , @xmath4 is the fluid velocity field ( which we take to be incompressible ) and @xmath5 the molecular diffusivity .",
    "we will refer to this equation as the _ passive tracers model_.    it can be shown using multiscale / homogenization techniques @xcite that when the velocity field @xmath4 is either periodic or random with sufficiently good mixing properties , the long time , large scale dynamics of is governed by an effective brownian motion with a nonnegative covariance matrix , the _ effective diffusion tensor _ or _ effective diffusivity_. the calculation of the effective diffusivity , in the case where the velocity field is a smooth periodic field , requires the solution of an appropriate boundary value problem , the _ cell problem _ , together with the calculation of an integral over the period of the velocity field  ( * ? ? ?",
    "similar results hold for random , time dependent velocity fields  @xcite .",
    "various properties of the effective diffusivity have been investigated .",
    "in particular it has been shown that the effective diffusivity is always enhanced over bare molecular diffusivity for incompressible flows @xcite while it is always depleted for potential flows , @xcite , ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "13 ) for a discussion ) .",
    "furthermore , the scaling of the effective diffusivity with respect to the bare molecular diffusion @xmath5 , in particular in the physically interesting regime @xmath6 , has been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "it has been shown that the scaling of the diffusion coefficient with @xmath5 depends crucially on the streamline topology  @xcite .",
    "for example , for steady flows with closed streamlines the effective diffusivity scales like @xmath5 , as @xmath7 , whereas for flows with open streamlines ( shear flows ) it scales like @xmath8  @xcite . note that for @xmath9 the diffusivity scales like @xmath10 .",
    "there are various physical applications where modeling the noise in equation   as delta correlated in time is inadequate . as an example we mention the problem of transport of passive scalars in the ocean ; in this case the noise comes from the unresolved velocity scales which are correlated in time @xcite . a simple variant of equation   where the noise process has a non trivial correlation structure is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an ornstein - uhlenbeck process with exponential correlation function , @xmath13 we will refer to this problem as the _ coloured noise _ problem for passive tracers .",
    "it is still possible to show , using multiscale / homogenization techniques , that the long time / large scale behaviour solutions to equation   is governed by an effective brownian motion with effective diffusivity @xmath14  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "there exist various applications where inertial effects can not be ignored . as examples we mention rain formation  @xcite and suspensions of biological organisms in the ocean .",
    "recently there has been a burst of activity on the theoretical and numerical study of various mathematical models for the motion of inertial particles in laminar and turbulent flows  @xcite .",
    "the starting point for many theoretical investigations concerning inertial particles is stokes law which says that the force @xmath15 exerted by the fluid on the particle is proportional to the difference between the background fluid velocity and the particle velocity : @xmath16 various extensions of this basic model have been considered in the literature , in particular by maxey and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for a particle subject to the force and molecular diffusion is @xmath17 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is a @xmath3-dimensional brownian motion and @xmath18 is the stokes number .",
    "we will refer to this as the _ inertial particles model_. it is possible to show , with the use of multiscale / homogenization techniques , that for either steady periodic or time dependent random velocity fields , the long time , large scale dynamics of solutions to   is governed by an effective brownian motion @xcite . for the calculation of the effective diffusion tensor the solution of a boundary value problem",
    "is required , together with the calculation of an integral over the phase space @xmath19 .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient for inertial particles depends in a complicated , highly nonlinear way on the parameters of the problems , such as the stokes number , the strength of the noise and the velocity correlation time .",
    "very little is known analytically concerning the dependence of the effective diffusivity on these parameters , in contrast to the passive tracers case where this problem has been studied extensively .",
    "for example , numerical simulations presented in  @xcite suggest that for incompressible flows the effective diffusivity for inertial particles is always greater than that of passive tracers , but no proof of this result exists .",
    "furthermore , the presence of inertia gives rise to various asymptotic limits of physical interest in addition to the relevant distinguished limits for the passive tracers model , such as taking @xmath7 while keeping the stokes number @xmath18 fixed , as well as the limit where @xmath20 simultaneously .",
    "since very little is known analytically for the effective diffusivity , one has to resort to numerical ( monte carlo ) simulations for its calculation . for the accurate numerical calculation of the diffusion coefficient it is necessary to use numerical methods that can integrate accurately the stochastic equations of motion over long time intervals ( i.e. until the system reaches the asymptotic regime described by an effective brownian motion ) ;",
    "furthermore , it is desirable that the numerical method is robust with respect to variations in the parameters of the problems such as the stokes number , the strength of molecular diffusion etc . in particular , we want numerical methods which perform well when the parameters in the equations of motion become either very large or very small .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold :    a.   we propose new numerical integrators for passive tracers and inertial particles , by constructing stochastic generalizations of the geometric integrator proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to construct integrators by composing a geometric integrator with the explicit solution of a gaussian stochastic differential equation .",
    "this idea is also used in molecular dynamics : see @xcite and the references within .",
    "b.   having shown the efficiency of the resulting method for the calculation of the effective diffusivity for passive tracers , we investigate numerically various asymptotic limits of physical interest , including inertial particles and the coloured noise problem for passive tracers .",
    "in addition , we generalize the invariant manifold result for inertial particles in cellular flows  @xcite to the stochastic case  , by using stochastic averaging .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the stochastic geometric integrator for both the passive tracers and inertial particles cases .",
    "section 3 contains some theoretical analysis of the numerical method , more specifically the proof of convergence of the method and the behaviour of the method in the case of small inertia . in section 4",
    "we summarize various results concerning equations and in the asymptotic limits @xmath7 and @xmath21 .",
    "finally sections 5,6 and 7 contain various numerical investigations of the relevant asymptotic limits highlighted in section 4 .",
    "in this section we describe the stochastic splitting method for both passive tracers and inertial particles . before doing this",
    "we describe a special feature of the taylor - green velocity velocity field and then describe the numerical method in a general framework abstracting this case .",
    "the taylor - green velocity field @xmath22 , stands for @xmath23 @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 using the product formula @xmath26 , inline the vector field @xmath27 can be split as follows : @xmath28 where by @xmath29 we denote the usual inner product on @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 the key property of this velocity field is that the vectors @xmath33 are orthogonal for each @xmath34 : @xmath35 with this in mind we proceed to the analysis of the splitting method in the case where the velocity field can be written as @xmath36 assuming holds .",
    "note that each vector field @xmath37 is itself incompressible and integrable because of .",
    "more precisely , if we consider the ode @xmath38 is easy to check that , by , @xmath39 thus @xmath40    note also that in the taylor - green case the vectors are @xmath41-dimensional but the method we describe works for vectors of arbitary finite dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the idea of exploiting the splitting to construct volume - preserving integrators for with @xmath42 is introduced in @xcite .",
    "we now describe the stochastic splitting method for velocity fields with the properties , in the passive tracers case .",
    "we want to solve the equation .",

    "we simply set @xmath47 where @xmath48 are i.i.d vectors with @xmath49 .",
    "if we define the random map    @xmath50    then @xmath51      we now describe the stochastic splitting method for velocity fields with the properties , in the inertial particle case .",
    "a generalization of the strategy from the previous subsection is as follows .",
    "the inertial particles system can be written as a first order system @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the most straightforward splitting would appear to be found by writing @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 which corresponds to adding a brownian motion in the last step . however , the resulting splitting methods lead to restrictions on @xmath58 , something we wish to avoid . to this end we set @xmath59 and @xmath60 where the last step now corresponds to an ornstein uhlenbeck process with timescale @xmath18 , in @xmath61 .",

    "it is clear that the behaviour of the particle is drastically different . in the case of the euler - maryama method",
    "the particle appears to be much more diffusive than in the case of the stochastic splitting method .",
    "we now compare the two methods in the case of zero noise , since that will help us to understand the different behaviour in the small noise regime . in figure [ xaroula2 ] we draw the phase plane in the absence of noise .    in the absence of noise",
    "the system is hamiltonian and thus solutions to should follow closed orbits .",
    "the stochastic splitting method maintains this property of the system , being a volume preserving method , as shown in figure [ xaroula2]b . on the other hand the euler scheme fails to maintain this property of the system , and instead solutions spiral out @xcite  see figure [ xaroula2]a .",
    "when @xmath5 is small the spiraling effect in the euler method leads to faster escapes from the cell than the stochastic splitting method and hence to overestimated effective diffusivities .    in figure [ thala ]",

    "for values of @xmath5 smaller than @xmath193 we see that the effective diffusivity does not behave as the theory predicts , even for the splitting method .",
    "however this should not come as a surprise , since as we see in result [ th : diffusive_time ] the time for the particle to be diffusive is of order @xmath165 and thus integrating up to @xmath184 is not enough since the particle has not yet reached its diffusive regime .    before rejecting the euler - maryama method for our problem",
    "we will make one last comparison .",
    "we expect that the volume preserving method is roughly 3 times slower than the euler method since it involves 2 extra steps in order to compute the value of the solution at each timestep .",
    "thus , a fair comparison is to compare the euler method over the splitting method when the former uses a timestep that is one third of the latter .",
    "so , we use a timestep of @xmath194 for the volume preserving method and then calculate the effective diffusivity for @xmath195 using @xmath183 trajectories .",

    "the failure of the euler method is once again obvious .",
    "even when we use the a timestep 16 times smaller than the one used in the the splitting method , the calculated effective diffusivity is 5 times larger than the correct value , which we calculate with the splitting method .",
