    "in stokes flow near a corner between two intersecting solid boundaries or a solid boundary and a free surface , the existence of a sequence of counter - rotating vortices was first established theoretically by h. k. moffatt @xcite .",
    "a flow visualization experiment by taneda @xcite in a v - notch endorsed the existence of these vortices .",
    "they are known as `` moffatt vortices '' , named aptly after h. k. moffatt .",
    "such vortices are formed due to rotation of a cylinder or external stirring force close to the solid boundaries .",
    "a careful undermining into the existing literature reveals that the study of moffatt vortices in stokes flow on different geometries @xcite has so far been established mostly through theoretical studies .",
    "there have been very few numerical studies @xcite on this topic available in the existing literature . in this work ,",
    "we study the existence of moffatt eddies at the bottom corners for the flow in lid - driven cavity at moderate reynolds numbers by using a recently developed higher - order - compact ( hoc ) scheme by kalita _",
    "@xcite on non - uniform space grids .",
    "we further establish that the moffatt eddies in succession follow geometric ratios of the size and intensities which again depend on reynolds numbers . by grid independence study and computing pressure gradients along the walls of the cavity ,",
    "we confirm that the smallest scales captured by us are not numerical artifacts .",
    "this paper is organized in four sections .",
    "the problem is briefly described in section [ sec2 ] , while section [ sec3 ] deals with numerical procedures and other related issues , section [ sec4 ] with results and discussions and finally , in section [ sec5 ] we summarize the whole work .",
    "we have considered the classical lid - driven square cavity problem ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) which is one of the most extensively solved problems in cfd as it displays almost all fluid mechanical phenomena for incompressible viscous flows .",
    "the governing equations for the flow in cavity are the two - dimensional ( 2d ) incompressible navier - stokes ( n - s ) equations which in the non - dimensional primitive - variables form are given by @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the velocities along the @xmath3- and @xmath4- directions , @xmath5 is the time , @xmath6 is the pressure and @xmath7 is the reynolds number where @xmath8 is the characteristic velocity ( velocity of the lid ) , @xmath9 is the characteristic length ( side of the square cavity ) and @xmath10 is the kinematic viscosity .    introducing streamfunction @xmath11 and vorticity @xmath12 , the above equations ( [ eqn1])-([eqn3 ] ) transform to @xmath13",
    "the unsteady convection - diffusion equation in 2d for a flow variable @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the convection coefficients in the @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions , respectively , and @xmath19 is a forcing function .",

    "_ @xcite .    in order to capture moffatt vortices on relatively coarser grids ,",
    "it is essential that the regions in the neighborhood of the solid boundaries are filled with cluster grids . to generate a centro - symmetric grid with clustering near the walls , we use the stretching function @xcite @xmath33 in both @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions .",
    "the boundary conditions for velocity on the top wall are given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "on other walls of the cavity , the velocities are zero i.e , @xmath36 , @xmath35 . for streamfunction vorticity formulation ,",
    "streamfunction values are zero along the four walls i.e , @xmath37 . for vorticity",
    "a transient hoc wall boundary approximation @xcite has been used . in order to solve the algebraic systems associated with the finite difference approximation ( [ eqn8 ] ) the biconjugate gradient stabilized method ( bicgstab",
    ") @xcite has been used because non - uniform grid invariably leads to non - symmetric matrices .",
    "for the problem under consideration , computations were carried out for @xmath38 on grids of sizes @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it is a well known fact that even the best available computational resources are incapable of capturing all the members of the so called infinite sequence of moffatt vortices . with the computational resource available at our hand ,",
    "we have been able to capture the first few members in that sequence .",
    "we now present those members in terms of streamfunction contours ( see figure [ fig2]-[fig4 ] ) . for these vortices ,",
    "the following nomenclature has been adopted .",
    "for the vortices at the left corner , bl1 denotes the secondary vortex which is the first one to appear in the sequence .",
    "likewise , bl2 , bl3 , bl4 , @xmath42 denote the tertiary , quaternary and post - quaternary vortices respectively in that sequence in the same corner . in a similar way , for the moffatt vortices in the right corner ,",
    "the vortices in the same sequence are denoted by br1 , br2 , br3 , br4 , @xmath42 etc .",
    "( a )    ( b )    ( a )    ( b )    ( a )    ( b )      in table [ tab1 ] , we provide properties of moffatt vortices in terms of their intensities and sizes along with the location of their centers .",
    "the intensity of a vortex is defined by the streamfunction value at the center of the vortex .",
    "following the work of h. k. moffatt @xcite , we measure the size of a vortex in terms of the euclidean distance between the center of the vortex and the corner of the cavity .",
    "we observe that the intensity as well as size of these vortices decrease rapidly , thus corroborating our findings with the theory .",
    "for a fixed reynolds number , as grid size increases , one can observe the extreme closeness of the values of intensity and size in smaller scales also .",
