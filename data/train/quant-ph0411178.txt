    "there is currently a strong interest for the manipulation of individual neutral atoms in microscopic ( at subwavelength size ) optical dipole traps @xcite .",
    "the ability to manipulate atoms individually may open a way to controlled engineering of the quantum states of small sets of trapped particles , in order to encode and process information at the quantum level @xcite . a red - detuned optical dipole trap works as follows : the ac stark shift induced by a red - detuned trapping light lowers the ground - state energy of the atom proportionally to the local light intensity @xcite .",
    "the spatial dependence of the atomic potential energy is therefore equivalent to the spatial dependence of the light intensity .",
    "the atom has the lowest potential energy in the region of maximum intensity and can therefore be trapped there . for very large",
    "detuning , typically several nanometers , the photon scattering rate becomes so low that the optical trapping potential is truly conservative .",
    "the optical dipole trap is usually loaded by precooled atoms from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "there are two schemes of _ microscopic _ optical dipole traps to store individual atoms . the first one is based on a _ strongly focused",
    "_ single gaussian laser beam @xcite .",
    "the second one is based on the use of a _ standing wave _ of two counterpropagating laser beams with equal intensities and optical frequencies @xcite . in both schemes ,",
    "the size of the trapping region is less than the light wavelength .",
    "recently , we proposed a new method for _ microscopic _ trapping of individual atoms @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the use of a subwavelength - diameter silica fiber with a single ( red - detuned ) light beam @xcite or with two ( red- and blue - detuned ) light beams @xcite launched into it .",
    "the light waves decay away from the fiber wall and produce optical potentials for neutral atoms .",
    "the red - detuned light wave produces an attractive potential . to sustain stable trapping",
    ", the atoms must be kept away from the fiber wall .",
    "this can be achieved by the centrifugal potential barrier in the one - color scheme @xcite or by the repulsive optical potential from the blue - detuned laser beam in the two - color scheme @xcite .",
    "the atom trapping and guiding occur outside the fiber .",
    "we have shown that stable trapping and guiding can be achieved only when the fiber diameter is smaller than the light wavelength .",
    "the great advantages of our scheme are ( a ) localization of atoms to a subwavelength region , ( b ) high efficiency to detect individual atoms , ( c ) high accessibility to the trapped atoms , and ( d ) achievement of strong coupling between light and matter @xcite .",
    "due to the conservative character of optical potentials , the loading of atoms into dipole traps requires the use of friction forces , which can be provided by the doppler cooling mechanism in mots @xcite .",
    "the loading of a dipole trap from a mot is a dynamical process rich in physics @xcite .",
    "a major obstacle to the efficient loading of a dipole trap is that the excited electronic states generally experience positive ac stark shifts of comparable magnitude to the negative shift of the ground state .",
    "these light shifts with opposite signs change the resonant frequencies of the atoms in the dipole trap .",
    "when the spatial gradient of the trapping fields is high , the resonant frequencies of the atoms vary substantially with their positions within the dipole trap .",
    "this effectively introduces a strong spatial dependence of the detuning between the atomic cooling transition and the mot fields .",
    "the detuning may become large or positive .",
    "this prevents the efficient doppler cooling . as a result ,",
    "the doppler cooling is generally incompatible with the dipole trapping .",
    "the extremely small volume of a microscopic dipole trap makes the problem even worse : the time - averaged number of atoms in a microscopic dipole trap ( loaded from a mot ) can be less than one .",
    "katori _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed and demonstrated a trap loading scheme that helps overcome the above obstacle @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use an appropriate wavelength of the trapping laser light ( called the magic wavelength ) at which ( due to the specific multilevel structure of a real atom ) the stark shifts of the lower and upper levels of the cooling transition have the same value and the same sign .",
    "it has been demonstrated for strontium atoms that the choice of a magic wavelength for a red - detuned far - off - resonance trap allows simultaneous doppler cooling and dipole trapping and hence enables high loading efficiency of magneto - optically trapped atoms into the optical dipole trap @xcite .",
    "the spatial dependence of the atomic resonant frequencies also leads to additional complications in the monitoring ( probing ) processes .",
    "have recently demonstrated for cesium atoms that the choice of a magic wavelength for a red - detuned far - off - resonance trap allows state - insensitive trapping and continuous observation of trapped atoms @xcite .    in this paper , we address the problem of minimizing the spatial dependence of the light shifts of the atomic transitions in a two - color dipole trap . we show that the light shifts of the @xmath0 cesium transitions can be minimized by tuning one trapping light to around @xmath1 nm in wavelength ( central red - detuned magic wavelength ) and the other light to around @xmath2 nm in wavelength ( central blue - detuned magic wavelength ) .",
    "we calculate the optical potentials of cesium atoms in the ground and excited states in a two - color evanescent field around a subwavelength - diameter fiber .",
    "we show the possibility of state - insensitive two - color trapping and guiding .",
    "before we proceed , we note that , due to recent developments in taper fiber technology , thin fibers can be produced with diameters down to 50 nm @xcite .",
    "thin fiber structures can be used as building blocks in future atom and photonic micro- and nano - devices .",

    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the light shifts of the @xmath152 transitions of the atoms trapped around the fiber .",
    "the figure shows that the light shifts can be reduced to become less than 14 mhz .",
    "such a shift is comparable to the typical detuning of near - resonant fields used for a mot with cesium atoms ( typical detuning is 1020 times of the natural linewidth @xmath153 mhz of the cesium @xmath87 line ) @xcite .",
    "thus , due to the use of the red- and blue - magic wavelengths , the spatial dependences of the light shifts of atomic transitions are weak .",
    "this opens up an opportunity for state - insensitive trapping , i.e. , for simultaneous trapping of ground- and excited - state atoms @xcite .",
    "if we detune the mot fields from the cooling transition by a negative detuning @xmath154 with a magnitude @xmath155 mhz , then the red - detuning condition for the mot fields ( cooling fields ) in the presence of the far - off - resonance evanescent fields ( optical trapping fields ) is kept throughout the outside of the fiber .",
    "this allows the simultaneous operation of the mot and the dipole trap .",
    "( a ) and the ground - state manifold @xmath3 ( b ) .",
    "all the parameters are the same as those for fig .",
    "we show only the results for the transitions involving the excited - state sublevels that are split from @xmath106 . ]",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the optical potentials of the excited- and ground - state atoms for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] that the excited- and ground - state optical potentials have similar shapes , with deep minima located close to each other in space .",
    "this indicates the possibility of state - insensitive two - color trapping of cesium atoms around the fiber .",
    "such a state - independent trapping scheme allows the simultaneous operation of trapping and probing , that is , the operation of trapping with continuous observation during the trapping interval .",
    "et al . _ have proposed and demonstrated a similar state - insensitive trapping method , which is based on the use of counter - propagating laser beams at a red - detuned magic wavelength @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the light shifts of the @xmath156 transitions in atomic cesium can be minimized by tuning one trapping light to around @xmath1 nm in wavelength ( central red - detuned magic wavelength ) and the other light to around @xmath2 nm in wavelength ( central blue - detuned magic wavelength ) .",
    "we have investigated the light shifts of the cesium hfs sublevels in a two - color evanescent field around a subwavelength - diameter fiber .",
    "the simultaneous use of the red- and blue - detuned magic wavelengths allows state - insensitive two - color trapping and guiding of cesium atoms along the thin fiber .",
    "our results can be used to efficiently load a two - color dipole trap by cesium atoms from a magneto - optical trap and to perform continuous observations .",
