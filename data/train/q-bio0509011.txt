    "imagine a large , but finite population of @xmath0 individuals , with @xmath0 fixed .",

    "let us assume that there is an advantage in belonging to a _",
    "smaller _ group , but that changing the group is only reasonable if individuals from different groups meet . as a justification for this setting , we envision that each individual might only know the size of its own group , but not necessarily the size of any other one . consequently , a comparison requires the exchange of information . for simplicity , we assume honesty in this process .    to specify the dynamics , we assume that , at a fixed rate ( which we may choose to be @xmath6 for simplicity ) , two individuals chosen at random from the entire population meet and act according to the following protocol . if both are from the same group , or from groups of the same size , no action is taken ; otherwise , the individual from the larger group joins the smaller one , by changing type accordingly .",
    "we assume that the advantage depends on group size only , not on type .",
    "note that a situation where @xmath7 is changed into @xmath8 is overall neutral , and also neutral from the point of view of the acting individual .    in this short note",
    ", we consider the resulting dynamics in the deterministic limit as @xmath9 , with a fixed number of types .",
    "this approach is appropriate because the protocol is deterministic , and no extinction can occur in the finite size situation .",
    "therefore , no stochastic effects of relevance are possible .",
    "consequently , we shall look at the deterministic time evolution of the corresponding ( discrete ) probability distribution @xmath10 of the types .",
    "this setting is known as the _ infinite population limit _ ( ipl ) , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "11.2 ) for background material and @xcite for recent examples . for a finite population ,",
    "@xmath11 are the type frequencies .",
    "the model thus shows a frequency dependence , which is weak in the sense that only the signs of the differences @xmath12 matter , but not their magnitudes .",
    "this approach leads to a simple , but rather interesting system of nonlinear odes , with discontinuous right - hand side .",
    "the latter property requires some care concerning the concepts of a solution and of an equilibrium , since the standard results of ode theory do not directly apply .",
    "however , this will cause no problem in our case , where we shall see that the globally stable equilibrium , @xmath13 , is reached in _ finite _ time from any initial condition in the interior of the probability simplex ( see below for details ) .",
    "our simple example is illustrative in the sense that a biologically relevant , non - smooth dynamical system can be looked at and solved explicitly , without invoking the general theory @xcite or resorting to abstract results @xcite .",
    "in fact , to derive the solution , one only needs a good understanding of the logistic equation in continuous time , compare ( * ? ? ? * ch .  1 ) .",
    "in our multi - dimensional system , the solution curves of the various components display a tree - like coalescing structure .",
    "the corresponding coalescing times are the relevant time scales that would also show up in smooth approximations of this non - smooth dynamical system ( where they appear as the characteristic times of the exponential closing - in of the components ) .",
    "the model is a toy example of game theoretic flavour , compare @xcite , where a key ingredient is the use of non - local information ( the group sizes ) . as such",
    ", it can be considered as a model of population dynamics @xcite , but is rather different from the standard models of population genetics , compare @xcite . as possible applications",
    ", one could think of population patches ( spatial advantage ) , food specialisation ( supply advantage ) , advertising strategies ( promotional advantage ) or name choosing ( recognisability ) , to name but a few .",
    "similar models , and also more general ones , have been investigated in mathematical game theory .",
    "one early example is the ideal free distribution of fretwell and lucas in ecology @xcite , which describes the spatial distribution of a population among a fixed number of resource patches .",
    "this is related to the evolutionary stable strategies of game theory , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "various dynamics , including imitation and replicator dynamics , are considered in this context , compare the excellent review by hofbauer and sigmund @xcite with its extensive bibliography .",
    "even though our model can be seen as a special case of imitation dynamics , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "8.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2 ) , it results from a specific finite size model via the infinite population limit , and is thus fixed . since we see this as a first step towards more realistic models including stochastic and finite - size effects , we find it slightly more natural to use the classic notions of dynamical systems rather than to formulate the model and its solution in the language of game theory ( we shall give the translation below for comparison ) .",
    "the reservoir of types , or _ state space _ , is @xmath14 , i.e. , there are _ finitely _ many different states . in the ipl limit @xcite ,",
    "one considers the deterministic time evolution of probability vectors @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the proportion of the ( infinite ) population in state @xmath2 . for the model described above , with @xmath19 ,",
    "this gives the system of odes @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the signum function , i.e. , @xmath22 more generally , one could consider the odes @xmath23 where @xmath24 \\longrightarrow { \\mathbb{r}{\\hspace{0.5pt}}}$ ] is an odd function ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) that is continuous , or ( as @xmath21 above ) piecewise continuous with only finitely many jumps .",
    "in particular , @xmath26 .    in general , such discontinuities require solutions to be defined accordingly , e.g. , in the sense of filippov @xcite , thus referring to the well developed theory of odes with discontinuous right - hand sides . fortunately , and not untypically for models with a biological context",
    ", one can introduce all ingredients required for our model in an elementary way .",
    "moreover , one can make most results explicit , thus illustrating aspects usually obtained by qualitative theory .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath27 is continuous .",
    "then , the forward flow of the dynamical system leaves the cone of positive vectors invariant , which follows from the observation that @xmath28 implies @xmath29 , together with standard arguments from ( * ? ? ?",
    "16 ) . since @xmath26 ,",
    "one also finds @xmath30 whence @xmath31 and total mass is preserved . in particular , the forward flow of preserves the simplex of probability vectors , @xmath32 .",

    "fortunately , eq .   permits a much simpler approach , based directly on the single - valued function @xmath34 .",
    "clearly , solutions of can no longer be expected to be differentiable everywhere .",
    "the starting point is then the class of absolutely continuous functions , which are differentiable almost everywhere .",
    "a solution of our ode is then a function of this class that satisfies almost everywhere . as we shall see explicitly below",
    ", the solutions of are actually piecewise smooth , with only _ finitely _ many points of non - differentiability ( coinciding with the coalescence points of components ) . more precisely , at the glueing points , the value of the previous segment provides the initial value for the next",
    ". it will always be evident that this construction yields the unique solution .    in what follows",
    ", we shall only consider the dynamical system restricted to the probability simplex @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , we mainly consider initial values from its interior , because otherwise , in view of the right - hand side of , we could start with a smaller state space right away , i.e. , with a probability simplex of smaller dimension . in this sense",
    ", the restriction to the interior of @xmath39 covers all cases , by suitable choice of @xmath1 .",
    "the equilibria of our systems or certainly include the uniform distribution on @xmath14 or that on any subset of it .",
    "these correspond to the centre of the simplex @xmath39 or to the centre of some boundary of it , the latter effectively being a simplex @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "further equilibria can exist if @xmath42 has zeros other than @xmath43 .",
    "however , we are primarily interested in stable equilibria , such as @xmath44 for .",
    "in fact , the latter is even _ globally stable _ , meaning that any initial condition from the _ interior _ of @xmath39 will converge , under the forward flow , to this equilibrium , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.2 ) for a brief discussion of these concepts .",
    "let us briefly expand on this point . observing that both models and can be viewed as special cases of imitation dynamics in game theory ( with the negative identity matrix being the payoff matrix , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  8.3 ) ) , one can derive that they possess a lyapunov function , subject to certain conditions on the function @xmath27 .",
    "this can also be seen explicitly as follows .",
    "if we define @xmath45 , a simple double summation argument using shows that @xmath46 consequently , as all @xmath47 , @xmath48 if @xmath27 is a non - decreasing odd function ( note that @xmath49 is then even and @xmath50 ) .",
    "if @xmath43 is the only zero of @xmath51 and @xmath52 a point in the interior of @xmath39 , one has @xmath53 unless @xmath52 is the centre of @xmath39 .",
    "this establishes @xmath54 as a strict lyapunov function for the interior of @xmath39 in these cases , see @xcite for details on this concept .",
    "this observation establishes the global stability result of the equilibrium point @xmath55 , both for and .",
    "the hierarchy of boundaries of @xmath39 can be treated separately , by identifying them with appropriate cases of smaller dimension .",
    "let us consider eq .   for @xmath56 .",
    "setting @xmath57 and @xmath58 , it is clear that it now suffices to consider the single ode @xmath59 if @xmath60 , this simplifies to @xmath61 , which is the well - known logistic equation in continuous time , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  1 ) .",
    "it has the solution @xmath62 if the initial condition of is @xmath63 , this formula also provides the solution we need , until @xmath64 reaches the value @xmath65 , whereupon the solution continues as @xmath66  the globally stable equilibrium . as is not untypical of odes with discontinuous right - hand sides ,",
    "compare @xcite , this happens after a _ finite _ time , namely at @xmath67    similarly , if @xmath68 , eq .",
    "simplifies to @xmath69 .",
    "provided that @xmath70 , the solution now is @xmath71 with @xmath72 as before , until @xmath64 hits @xmath65 from above .",
    "this happens at time @xmath73 in this rather simple case , @xmath74 , and the complete solution is thus given in closed form , with one coalescence point at time @xmath75 or @xmath76 , depending on the initial condition . if @xmath77 ( i.e. , @xmath78 ) , @xmath79 , and one is in the equilibrium from the very beginning .",
    "if @xmath80 , one can simplify the situation enormously by assuming , without loss of generality , that the initial condition is non - degenerate ( meaning that all types occur ) and ordered , so that @xmath81 if the @xmath18 are all equal , we must have @xmath82 , i.e. , we are ( and stay ) in equilibrium .",
    "so , let us assume that at least one further inequality sign is proper , and that the leftmost position where this happens is between @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "in other words , @xmath85 since @xmath86 , one then has @xmath87 , for any @xmath88 . then , a short calculation with eq .   shows that the time evolution of all @xmath18 with @xmath89 is identical , and given by the ode @xmath90 as long as @xmath91 remains true .",
    "this variant of the logistic equation has the solution @xmath92    in general , the situation can be described as follows .",
    "whatever the initial condition is , one can bring it to the standard form , by a permutation of the types .",
    "in forward time , the ordering then remains that way .",
    "step by step , two or more neighbouring @xmath18 coalesce , all in finite time , until the equilibrium is reached ( also in finite time ) . with increasing @xmath1",
    ", there is a growing number of different possibilities for the emerging coalescent trees of components ( not to be mixed up with the result of the well - known coalescent process from population genetics , compare @xcite ) , which makes a closed formula for the solution cumbersome .",
    "the general picture , however , is rather intuitive , and will become evident from the explicit solution for @xmath93 .",
    "let us consider our system for @xmath93 and assume @xmath94 in order to exclude any degenerate situation .",
    "it is clear that we now have three different coalescent trees to distinguish , see figure [ dreipic ] .",
    "the system of odes now reads @xmath95 with @xmath96 , the solutions @xmath97 and @xmath98 start as @xmath99 while the solution for @xmath100 can be obtained from here by insertion and elementary integration , @xmath101 these solutions remain valid until @xmath97 meets with @xmath100 or @xmath100 with @xmath98 ( whatever is first ) , or both ( if they coincide ) .",
    "a simple calculation gives the coalescing times @xmath102 where the @xmath18 are to be read as @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath104 , all three curves @xmath105 coalesce in one point , @xmath106 . from here , the solution is then @xmath107 , the globally stable equilibrium of this situation , see the middle example in figure  [ dreipic ] .",
    "this happens if and only if the initial conditions satisfy @xmath108 in addition to @xmath109 .    otherwise , we have to distinguish the cases @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( which correspond to replacing equality in eq .   by @xmath112 or @xmath113 , respectively ) . in the former case ,",
    "the above solutions for @xmath114 and @xmath115 are valid until @xmath116 .",
    "afterwards , @xmath117 satisfies eq .   with @xmath118 , and solution @xmath119",
    "the solution for @xmath120 from remains valid until it meets with @xmath121 , which happens at @xmath122 this time can easily be calculated from the condition @xmath123 .    in the remaining case , @xmath111",
    ", we have @xmath124 after @xmath115 and @xmath120 met at @xmath125 , until @xmath126 meets with @xmath114 given in eq .   at time @xmath127 obtained from the condition @xmath128 .",
    "figure  [ dreipic ] shows a representative example , from which the general situation is clear .",
    "equilibria of smooth dynamical systems are usually reached only asymptotically .",
    "the above toy model does so in finite time , which is a consequence of the discontinuous right - hand side of .",
    "if the latter were replaced by a smooth approximation ( e.g. , a sigmoid curve ) , neighbouring lines would no longer meet in finite time , but close in exponentially fast instead  otherwise , the qualitative picture remains the same .",
    "in particular , if is considered with an odd function @xmath27 that is strictly monotonically increasing ( hence including sigmoid curves ) , the nature of the globally stable equilibrium remains unchanged .",
    "an advantage of the discontinuous system is its exact solvability , including the calculation of all relevant time scales .    as to the relevance of our findings for large , but _",
    "finite _ systems , fluctuations can lead to violations of the order relation .",
    "however , it is clear that the convergence to the equilibrium qualitatively remains the same if @xmath0 is a multiple of @xmath1 .",
    "otherwise , the equilibrium is reached up to fluctuations of at most one individual per group , i.e. , of order @xmath129 .",
    "this mirrors the deviations from the expectation values ( over all realisations of the stochastic process ) , the latter coinciding with the equilibrium of the ipl limit in this simple case",
    ".    it might be interesting to extend the above model by means of a stochastic ( rather than deterministic ) protocol , and to compare it with related models of game theory @xcite .",
    "this will automatically lead to various extension and generalisations . to reach a more complete and realistic picture",
    ", it will be necessary to develop a proper stochastic frame and to investigate relevant finite size effects by suitable simulations , see also @xcite for a brief discussion of these issues .",
    "these two aspects will certainly require more attention in the future .",
