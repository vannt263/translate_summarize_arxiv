    "relativistic double neutron star ( dns ) binary systems in tight orbits are valuable physical laboratories , since their rapid evolution allows stringent tests of gravitational theories in strong - field conditions ( e.g. , taylor & weisberg 1989 ) .",
    "they make a significant contribution to estimated event rates for gravitational wave detectors ( e.g. kim , kalogera & lorimer 2002 ) .",
    "dns binaries are rare since , even if the system survives the first supernova explosion , the progenitor system will typically disrupt with the second supernova explosion . also , they are observationally selected against because of the large orbital modulation of the pulsar period . in this _",
    "letter _ we report the discovery of psr j1756@xmath02251 , a 28.5  ms pulsar , and present strong evidence which suggests that it is the 8th dns binary system known and the 5th which will coalesce in less than a hubble time . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations ,  3 evaluates the nature of the companion , while  4 discusses the search for a possible pulsar companion . finally , ",
    "5 considers some of the implications of the discovery .",
    "psr j1756@xmath02251 was discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( pmps ; manchester et al .",
    "the pmps is the most successful survey for pulsars , with more than 700 pulsars discovered so far .",
    "the survey used a sensitive 13-beam receiver at the parkes radio telescope to cover the galactic plane @xmath10 , @xmath11 with 35-min integrations at a centre frequency of 1374  mhz , with 96 frequency channels covering 288  mhz bandwidth , using 250  @xmath12s sampling .",
    "an initial search using standard fourier techniques , as described in manchester et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , failed to detect psr j1756@xmath02251 .",
    "the data were subsequently re - analysed using an efficient acceleration code ( faulkner et al .",
    "2004 ) and psr j1756@xmath02251 was detected in three beams , with the best signal - to - noise ratio of 19 . the system was confirmed in june 2003 by re - observation at parkes , using the ` gridding ' technique described in morris et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "psr j1756@xmath02251 has subsequently been observed regularly from parkes at 1374  mhz using 288  mhz bandwidth ( bw ) and 1390  mhz using 256  mhz bw and 80 or 125  @xmath12s sampling time ( @xmath13 ) , plus occasional observations at 685  mhz ( 64  mhz bw , @xmath13 : 80  @xmath12s ) and 3030  mhz ( 768  mhz bw , @xmath13 : 80  @xmath12s ) ; at jodrell bank observatory at 1396  mhz ( 64  mhz bw , @xmath13 : 371  @xmath12s ) and 610  mhz ( 4  mhz bw , @xmath13 : 555  @xmath12s ) and the green bank telescope ( gbt ) at 1400  mhz ( 96  mhz bw , @xmath13 : 72  @xmath12s ) using the berkley caltech pulsar machine ( backer et al .",
    "full orbit observations of @xmath98  hrs have been made at parkes and the gbt .",
    "figure [ f : profile ] shows the integrated pulse profile of psr j1756@xmath02251 , at 1390  mhz with 512  khz frequency channels and 80  @xmath12s sampling ; it is sharp but featureless , with a pulse width of 2.7% of the spin period .",
    "the 1998 observations , with 3  mhz frequency channels , have higher dispersion smearing , however , the profile still appears similar .",
    "the profile at 3030  mhz is also similar while there is broadening at 685  mhz . given that profile widths of recycled pulsars hardly evolve with frequency ( kramer et al .",
    "1999 ) , this broadening is likely to be due to scattering .",
    "there is no evidence of any emission at phase 180@xmath14 from the pulse .    for regular coverage over the orbit , pulse time of arrivals ( toas )",
    "were made using 10  min sub - integrations from the parkes observations .",
    "three survey observations , made 5 years before the confirmation , were included .",
    "the bulk of the observations , including 1189 of the 1382 timing points , were made at jodrell bank , each using 5  min of integration each .",
    "the timing analysis used the tempo program and gave the timing parameters listed in table [ t : parameters ] .",
    "psr j1756@xmath02251 is very close to the ecliptic plane , which has made the determination of its declination using timing measurements relatively imprecise .",
    "the masses of the pulsar and its companion can not be measured independently in purely keplerian orbits .",
    "however , the ` mass function ' , @xmath15 , can be found from the orbital period @xmath16 and projected semi - major axis , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the orbital inclination .",
    "this relates the masses of the pulsar , @xmath19 , and the companion , @xmath20 , both in solar masses .",
    "since we fit for @xmath21 , clearly cos@xmath22 must be @xmath230 .",
    "we have measured the precession of the longitude of periastron , @xmath24 , to be @xmath1  deg  yr@xmath2 .",
    "this could be due to a combination of tidal effects caused by a non - compact deformable companion ( smarr & blandford 1976 ) , the effects of relativistic gravitational interaction ( taylor & weisberg 1989 ) or spin orbit coupling ( e.g. masters & roberts 1975 ) .",
    "although it would be possible for a hydrogen main - sequence star to fit in the orbit , it would induce an @xmath24 of @xmath91000 times the observed value ( see masters & roberts 1975 ) .",
    "alternatively , the companion could be a helium main - sequence star . using the relationship between @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 due to tidal effects derived in roberts , masters & arnett ( 1976 ) , we find that the required pulsar mass must be @xmath27  @xmath8 , which is very unlikely . furthermore , there is no evidence of occultations of the pulsar , which is consistent with the companion s identification as a compact object .",
    "hence , the companion must be a compact object ; either a neutron star ( ns ) or white dwarf ( wd ) . a fast rotating wd could affect @xmath24 by spin orbit coupling . following wex ( 1998 ) , we estimated the size of the contribution from a derived upper limit on @xmath28 . while we do not know all relevant angles in the system s geometry ,",
    "we conclude that this effect is insignificant , unless we observed the system under very specific angles and/or at particular phases of the orbital precession .",
    "while we consider this as unlikely , future observations will verify this conclusion .",
    "taking @xmath24 to be entirely due to the effects of general relativity , the total system mass can be derived ( see damour & taylor 1992 ) .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath29  @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ f : m2cosi ] shows @xmath24 as a function of @xmath20 and cos@xmath22 ; the data were analysed using the dd model of tempo ( damour & deruelle 1985 , 1986 ) .",
    "the total system mass is remarkably similar to that of the double pulsar system , j0737@xmath03039 ( @xmath30  m@xmath4 ; burgay et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the system mass , age of the pulsar and the significant eccentricity of 0.18 make a wd companion unlikely , since any accretion from the wd progenitor onto the ns would have circularised the orbit .",
    "if the companion is a wd then it would be a co type with a mass of @xmath91.2  @xmath8 . at a distance of 2.5  kpc and",
    "assuming the pulsar characteristic age of 443  myr we expect it to be magnitude @xmath3124 ( e.g. , garia - berro et al .",
    "while it is probably too faint to be seen in available optical surveys , we have , reviewed surveys and catalogues at the astrophysical virtual observatory , which includes objects with a maximum magnitude of 22.5 .",
    "no plausible optical counterpart was found .",
    "although not yet well constrained , we have measured the gravitational redshift parameter , @xmath5 , ( damour & duerelle 1986 ) to be @xmath32  ms .",
    "this puts further limits on the masses as shown in figure [ f : m2cosi ] .",
    "measurements of the shapiro delay parameters : range @xmath33 and shape @xmath6 , can provide estimates of both @xmath20 and @xmath18 ( e.g. , damour & taylor 1992 ) .",
    "it has not yet been possible to constrain @xmath33 well , but constraints on @xmath6 can be obtained by searching the @xmath34 hypersphere , obtained by running tempo over a range of sin@xmath22 and @xmath20 values .",
    "this further constraint is plotted as probability contours in figure [ f : m2cosi ] .    to constrain the masses of the pulsar and companion",
    "further we can assume that general relativity is correct and apply the ddgr ( damour - deruelle general relativity ) model ( taylor & weisberg 1989 ) .",
    "we have explored the @xmath34 hypersphere of @xmath35 and @xmath20 which are the only unknown parameters if the orbit is completely described by general relativity .",
    "a contour plot , of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , is shown as an insert in figure [ f : m2cosi ] .",
    "this indicates a light neutron star companion , possibly with a mass similar to or lighter than that of psr j0737@xmath03039b ( lyne et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the expected value of the gravitational wave damping of the orbit is below our present detection limit .",
    "assuming the pulsar has a mass 1.35  @xmath8 , general relativity predicts a value for @xmath36 of @xmath37 .",
    "psr j1756@xmath02251 probably followed a typical dns evolution ( e.g. phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) . both stars",
    "would initially have had masses @xmath38 .",
    "the pulsar was formed in a supernova explosion of the more massive component .",
    "subsequently , the companion expanded in its red giant phase and the pulsar accreted material , thus increasing its rotation rate .",
    "the two stars then spiralled together in a common envelope to give a tight orbit .",
    "finally , the companion star exploded as a supernova .",
    "the possibility that the companion star is also a pulsar has been explored .",
    "any second pulsar would be highly accelerated , which would normally have the effect of reducing search sensitivity due to pulse smearing .",
    "however , we now know the precise orbital parameters and dispersion measure of psr j1756@xmath02251 , we also know the ephemeris for a companion except for the projected semi - major axis , @xmath39 .",
    "this is dependent upon the ratio of the masses of the two stars : @xmath40 we are , therefore , able to make a fully coherent search for a companion pulsar using a series of values of @xmath20 appropriate to a neutron star . for each search ,",
    "a time series in the pulsar rest frame was constructed by taking each time sample from the closest sample in the observation time series .",
    "corrected time series from two full orbits of observations , at 1390  mhz from parkes , were searched using the standard approach for a solitary pulsar ( e.g. manchester et al .",
    "psr j0737 - 3039b is only visible for short periods at particular orbital phases ( lyne et al . 2004 ) ; consequently , searches were also conducted throughout the observation with a range of observation lengths from 10  min to the full orbit , with a limiting flux density of @xmath90.045  mjy .",
    "the process was repeated over a range of masses : @xmath41 .",
    "the searches were sensitive to spin - periods from @xmath421  ms up to 10  s.    unfortunately , no companion pulsar was detected with a luminosity limit of @xmath90.3  mjy kpc@xmath43 , below that of the faintest known pulsar which has a luminosity of 0.5  mjy kpc@xmath43 ( camilo 2003 ) .",
    "based on orbital damping due to emission of gravitational waves in general relativity ( peters & mathews 1963 ) , the coalescence time of psr j1756@xmath02251 is @xmath91.7  gyr .",
    "this is substantially less than the age of the universe and this system is therefore important in the estimation of coalesence rates of dns systems .",
    "general relativity predicts that the merging of two neutron stars will produce a burst of gravity waves ( misner , thorne & wheeler 1973 ) detectable over inter - galactic distances by ground - based gravity - wave ( gw ) detectors . the pulsars predicted to coalesce within 10  gyr are listed in table [ t : coalescing ] .",
    "the rate of mergers observable by gw detectors has been discussed extensively , see e.g. phinney ( 1991 ) and kim et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . following",
    "the discovery of psr j0737 - 3039 , predicted ns ",
    "ns coalesce rates were substantially increased ( burgay et al . 2003 , kalogera et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , these calculations use only three systems , psr s b1913 + 16 , b1534 + 12 and j0737@xmath03039a ; psr b2127 + 11c is usually not included in the calculations since it is in a globular cluster and probably formed by exchange interaction rather than binary evolution ( prince et al .",
    ". the predicted rate of mergers is dominated by psr j0737@xmath03039a due to its proximity , short time to coalesence and difficulty of discovery due to doppler smearing .",
    "because its parameters are similar to those of known pulsars and does not represent a new population , the addition of psr j1756@xmath02251 is not expected to make a significant difference to the predicted merger rate ( kalogera et al .",
    "2004 ) .    as noted by mclaughlin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , for seven of the dns systems known , ( excluding psr b2127 + 11c , see above ) , there appears to be a strong correlation between spin period , @xmath44 , and eccentricity , @xmath45 , as shown by the dashed line in figure [ f : correlation ] .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient , @xmath33 , for these seven systems is 0.97 .",
    "a monte carlo simulation in which seven data points are drawn from a flat distribution in @xmath44 and @xmath45 show that such high values of @xmath33 occur by chance only 0.1% of the time .",
    "this apparent correlation shows the current state of the dns systems . the basic relationship between @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "was formed early in the system s history , with some evolution over the actual , but uncertain , age of the system .",
    "qualitatively , this relationship may be due to a less massive progenitor of the companion neutron star evolving through its giant phase relatively slowly , leaving a longer time to spin - up the pulsar by accretion , hence a shorter spin period .",
    "prior to the supernova explosion of the companion star the orbit is expected to have been circularised due to accretion ( e.g bhattacharya & van den heuvel , 1991 ) .",
    "a less massive companion star will eject less mass from the explosion , hence , using the simplest symmetric mass loss model which ignores kick velocities , will result in a smaller recoil ( phinney & kulkarni , 1994 ) .",
    "hence , a less massive companion star will lead to a less eccentric dns system as well as to a shorter spin period .",
    "there is a similar correlation between spin period and companion mass further supporting this mechanism .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the various effects is clearly required .",
