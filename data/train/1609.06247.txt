    "the lam equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is weierstrass elliptic function , satisfying @xmath11 is a classical object of 19^th^ century mathematics .",
    "viewed as an equation in the complex domain , its solutions , which have a number of remarkable properties , were described explicitly by hermite and halphen , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath12 on the real line the potential @xmath10 has singularities .",
    "if , however , @xmath13 are all real , one can make a pure imaginary half - period shift by @xmath14 and consider the lam operator @xmath15 whose potential is real , @xmath16-periodic and regular on the whole of @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , one can apply bloch - floquet theory , which implies that the spectrum has a band structure , as described e.g.  in @xcite .    generically , the spectrum of a periodic schrdinger operator ( or hill operator ) on the real line consists of a countably infinite number of bands .",
    "it was ince @xcite who in 1940 first pointed out the remarkable fact that the spectrum of @xmath18 has a band structure with not more than @xmath5 gaps .",
    "erdlyi @xcite later showed that in fact all @xmath5 gaps are open .",
    "nowadays , this is just the simplest example in the large class of finite - gap operators discovered in the 1970s , see  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that all such operators can be described explicitly in terms of hyperelliptic riemann theta functions , with the lam operator corresponding to the elliptic case .",
    "however , it seems that the question of exactly which gaps in the spectrum are open has not been explicitly discussed in the literature even in this case .",
    "the first result of this paper , obtained in section 2 , demonstrates that in the lam case it is precisely the _ first _",
    "@xmath5 gaps that are open .",
    "although this fact may not be surprising for experts , we could not find a rigorous proof in the literature .",
    "for @xmath6 , the result is illustrated in figure [ fig : onegap ] , showing that all the closed gaps are indeed located in the infinite spectral band .",

    "the spectral theory of schrdinger operators with a complex periodic potential has been studied in a number of papers , see e.g.  @xcite as well as references therein .",
    "in particular , rofe - beketov @xcite showed that the _ spectrum _ of a schrdinger operator @xmath22 with periodic , regular , but complex - valued potential @xmath23 can be defined as the set of @xmath24 such that at least one solution of the equation @xmath25 is bounded on the whole real line .",
    "equivalently , the corresponding floquet multiplier @xmath26 , given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a period of @xmath23 , should lie on the unit circle : @xmath29    in the case of the lam operator , it follows from gesztesy and weikard @xcite , who studied the general elliptic finite - gap case , that the spectrum consists of finitely many regular analytic arcs , with at most one arc extending to infinity . in the general case of an operator with a periodic complex - valued potential , the question about the relative positions of the spectral arcs was raised earlier by pastur and tkachenko @xcite , who gave an example in which the spectral arcs intersect at interior points . gesztesy and",
    "weikard @xcite observed that more explicit examples are given by the spectrum of the @xmath6 lam operator for suitable rhombic period lattices , see also proposition [ prop : lemn ] and figures [ fig : lemnispec ] and [ fig : rhombspec ] below .",
    "note that if the shift @xmath30 in the lam operator ( [ intro_jac_lame ] ) , we have in general a periodic , regular , but complex - valued potential .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the floquet multipliers do not depend on @xmath4 , so that the spectrum is the same as in the self - adjoint case . moreover , setting @xmath31 in , we have essentially ince s result , since the corresponding operator is equivalent to the previous case .    in section 3 , we consider genuinely complex instances of the lam operator . more specifically , to begin with we allow any half - period @xmath2 in the potential and impose no reality conditions on the elliptic curve .",
    "using hermite s solutions of , we demonstrate that the spectrum of such a complex lam operator is independent of the value of @xmath4 .",
    "we prove this result for all @xmath9 .",
    "then we focus on the @xmath6 case .",
    "some of our results in this case were found earlier by gesztesy and weikard @xcite and batchenko and gesztesy @xcite .",
    "( we are very grateful to prof .",
    "gesztesy for making us aware of these important works . )",
    "we recall that hermite s solutions of the corresponding lam equation @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the weierstrass @xmath37- and @xmath38-function , see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "we have used the software _",
    "r _ to numerically compute the spectrum of the complex lam operator in particular cases .",
    "one example is displayed in figure [ fig : exspec ] , along with a plot of the corresponding zero set .",
    "further examples are provided in section 3 , see figures [ fig : rectspec ] to [ fig : rhombspec ] .    , and the spectrum of the complex lam operator with @xmath47 . ]",
    "we study in further detail lam operators with either rectangular or rhombic period lattices .",
    "in particular , for @xmath47 or @xmath48 , respectively , we show that all closed spectral gaps are contained in the spectral arc extending to infinity .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the spectrum in the rhombic lam case with @xmath49",
    "in this section , we consider the lam operator in the jacobian form @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 one of the jacobi elliptic functions , see e.g.  @xcite . the spectrum of @xmath18 is the set of @xmath54 such the corresponding lam equation @xmath55 has at least one solution @xmath56 that is bounded for all @xmath57 .",

[ lamethm ] coexistence of @xmath60-periodic or @xmath60-antiperiodic solutions of the lam equation occurs if and only if @xmath74 .",
    "in such a case , the spectrum of the lam operator has precisely @xmath77 gaps and all points of coexistence are located in the infinite spectral band .    a detailed account of ince s",

    "following their line of reasoning , we recall some key constructions and results that we need to complete the proof of theorem [ lamethm ] . since  are invariant under @xmath78 , we may and shall restrict attention to @xmath79 .    for convenience ,",

    "@xmath107 we let @xmath108 be the sets of corresponding eigenvalues of the lam operator .",

    "matrices ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , it follows that @xmath111 and @xmath112 consist of @xmath113 respectively @xmath114 real and distinct eigenvalues .    by specializing theorem 7.3 in @xcite to the lam case",
    ", we find that @xmath115 contains the simple part of the periodic spectrum .",

    "exist only if the matrices @xmath124 are singular .",
    "letting @xmath125 we introduce the sets @xmath126 just as in the periodic case , we see that each of the two sets @xmath127 consists of @xmath114 real and distinct eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , we infer from theorem 7.4 in @xcite that @xmath128 contains the simple part of the antiperiodic spectrum .",
    "[ lemma : antperspec ] let @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath118 belongs to the antiperiodic spectrum of the lam operator and has multiplicity @xmath119 , then @xmath129 .",
    "since the spectrum of the lam operator has precisely @xmath116 gaps , the ends of the gaps must be given by the @xmath5 largest eigenvalues in @xmath130 and all @xmath5 eigenvalues in @xmath131 .",

    "we are now ready to complete the proof of theorem [ lamethm ] for even @xmath5 . from  and",

    "hence there exists @xmath142 such that all points of coexistence are indeed contained in the infinite spectral band for @xmath143 .",

    "this concludes the proof in the case of even @xmath5 .",
