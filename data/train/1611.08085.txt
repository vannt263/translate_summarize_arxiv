    "also , the phenotypic heterogeneity brings in uniqueness to an individual in a population @xcite .",
    "this happens not only for differences at the genetic level but due to the presence of noise in an isogenic population .",
    "although genetic diversity is decisive in favour of evolution in the environmental and historical variability , the phenotypic variety can be ascribed to the randomness , intrinsic and extrinsic .",
    "cells , being exposed to the diverse environment , must respond to the fluctuating external signal to control their fate @xcite .",
    "a two - component system ( tcs ) is the most ubiquitous and the most compact signal transduction machinery observed in bacteria and in some plants and fungi @xcite .",
    "the tcs is a type of phosphotransfer cascade like the mapk cascade , but differs in the molecular mechanism @xcite . in tcs ,",
    "only one molecule of atp is consumed and gets transferred through the cascade , whereas in the case of mapk , at every phosphorylation step atp is consumed .",
    "the tcs is composed mainly of two parts : a membrane - bound sensor kinase ( sk ) protein , and a cytoplasmic response regulator ( rr ) protein .",
    "the rr protein , activated by the phosphorylation , acts as a transcription factor for downstream genes or facilitates another target like flagellar locomotive switch @xcite .",
    "the simplest and modular tcs , which are efficiently present in the broad spectrum of efficacy , overtake popularity than other signal transduction motifs due to its inherent plasticity in noise regulation .",
    "earlier studies on functionality of the sk @xcite , input - output robustness of the phosphotransfer module @xcite , bistability due to tcs mediated gene regulation @xcite , different stochastic switching responses @xcite and stochasticity induced active state locking and growth - rate dependent bistability @xcite have been reported .",
    "although most of the reported tcs have an autoregulatory feature , the know - how of noisy gene regulation coupled with the tcs signaling pathway has not been explored till date . within the purview of single - cell scenario , the effect of fluctuations can not be neglected in the tcs signaling pathway as fluctuations , whatever may be its source , has a key role in the gene regulation as well as in the post - translational modification that is taking place in the noisy cellular environment @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "our prime interest is to quantify fluctuations in the tcs that has a feedback in the form of autoregulation at the operon of the two proteins , the sensor kinase and the response regulator .",
    "depending on the nature of fluctuations of the extracellular signal , the signaling cascade must orient itself as to sense and respond appropriately . to this end , the phosphorylated response regulator ( @xmath0 ) is considered as the output of the network .",
    "hence , to study the propagation of noise through the cascade , we need to quantify the noisy characteristics of @xmath0 due to the external signal , the inducer ( @xmath1 ) . in this paper",
    ", we compute several experimentally realisable quantities , viz . , variance , fano factor , etc .",
    "we also calculate the information processing through the network as tcs transmits information of the alteration of the environment .    .",

    "bistability is a widely observed phenomenon in biochemical networks with sufficient nonlinearity @xcite . in the case of deterministic systems , with weak nonlinearity , bistability can not be observed .",
    "however , if one goes for small reaction volume , the generated stochasticity may induce bistability @xcite . nowadays with the increased use of the methods like fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry",
    ", one may decipher the noise induced heterogeneity in a clonal population @xcite .",
    "the advantage of a microscopic stochastic study over the macroscopic deterministic observation is that the same mathematical construct of a tcs network shows monostable as well as bistable property depending on the system size .",
    "bistable switches do not have any clue of the genetic changes , hence they are epigenetic .",
    "bistability has been observed in _",
    "e. coli _ by persister cells and in _ b. subtilis _ through spore formation and cannibalism @xcite .",
    "but the mechanism is different for the two species .",
    "the first one happens due to positive autoregulation of the master gene . in the second one , there exist a pair of mutual repressors . in the current model , we are interested in the first type , positive autoregulation driven bistability . to this end",
    ", we examine the tcs dynamics using a stochastic approach for a range of parameter set to observe the transition from unimodal to a bimodal distribution .",
    "the system , here we are dealing with , is a generic bacterial two - component signal transduction machinery that gets activated by an external stimulus . while activated , it regulates one or several downstream genes .",
    "the full signal transduction pathway may be divided into two interconnected modules , the autoregulation module and the phosphotransfer module .",
    "the autoregulation module is driven by the latter . in the phosphotransfer module , the external stimulus or the inducer",
    "@xmath1 triggers the autophosphorylation of the membrane - bound sensor kinase ( sk ) @xmath2 at the conserved histidine residue to produce the phosphorylated form of @xmath2 , @xmath5 .",
    "the phosphate group is then transferred to the aspartate domain of the cognate cytoplasmic response regulator ( rr ) @xmath3 via a phosphotransfer mechanism along with the formation of @xmath0 .",
    "once produced @xmath0 regulates the binding of rna polymerase to the dna of several downstream genes .",
    "in addition , it regulates the activity of its operon present in the autoregulation module ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the phosphorylated rr becomes dephosphorylated by the unphosphorylated sk , thus acting as a phosphatase .",
    "the ability of the sk to act as kinase as well as phosphatase assigns it a bifunctional characteristic @xcite and allows one to place it in a broad category of functional motifs , the paradoxical components @xcite . for a bifunctional tcs sk can thus act as a source and a sink of the phosphate pool .",
    "the relevant kinetics of the full network along with the kinetic rate parameters are tabulated in table  1 . at this point",
    "it is important to mention that , in certain tcs , the phosphatase activity of the sensor kinase is absent thus making the tcs monofunctional @xcite .    to incorporate fluctuations due to different noise processes ,",
    "we opt for langevin method and calculate various physical entities .",
    "the extracellular noise comes from the environmental stimulus @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",

    "in such situation , the concentration of proteins goes down to zero at steady state .",
    "once the inducer assumes a non - zero value ( @xmath49 ) it activates the phosphotransfer cascade and generates the pool of the transcription factor @xmath0 , thus providing a positive feedback on the operon . as a result , the full signaling network ( autoregulation+phosphotransfer ) becomes operative .",
    "the utility of the tcs is to respond rapidly by properly transducing an external signal .",

    "the sources of different noise processes are widespread inside and outside the cell .",
    "some sources of randomness are shared by different proteins , correlated through interaction in the post - translational modification or due to sharing common expression operon . if we observe the post - translational reactions like the phosphotransfer between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the source of the fluctuations may differ from that of the gene regulation . here , to quantify all the network properties",
    ", we propose the inducer , @xmath1 to be the input and @xmath0 to be the network output as @xmath0 being of prime interest since it regulates many of the downstream genes .",
    "the classification of the source of noise is difficult for such a large and modular network .",
    "but one can quantify the fluctuations through the aforesaid different measures .",
    "the entire observation in this paper is partitioned into four segments .",
    "first , we focus on the phosphotransfer module to quantify fluctuations over a range of the external signal @xmath1 .",
    "second , we concentrate on the stochastic transcriptional process , which shows the dynamics of mrna fluctuations in response to the signal mediated feedback of the response regulator .",
    "third , we focus on the entire network to decipher different stochastic network properties , which reflect the reliability of the network performance . the final segment deals with the phosphorylated response regulator distribution at steady state to find the role of the switch in characterising the stability at the steady state .",
    "while sensing the external stimulus @xmath1 , @xmath2 gets itself phosphorylated and triggers the flow of signal . during phosphotransfer",
    "to @xmath3 through the kinase activity , @xmath5 transmits the noisy signal to the pool of @xmath0 . in the opposite ,",
    "when @xmath2 removes the phosphate from @xmath0 due to its phosphatase activity , there is no clue of noise reduction .",
    "the pool of total response regulator @xmath13 remains partly unphosphorylated ( @xmath3 ) at low signal strength ( fig .",
    "at this level , the variance of @xmath0 rises sharply in contrast to the quick fall of the variance of @xmath3 .",
    "the net fluctuations level in @xmath13 remains consistent with the model assumptions , @xmath50    where @xmath32 stands for the expectations of the protein pool and @xmath51 for the variances and covariances . as the signal rises , the pool of the response regulator gets fully phosphorylated and the variance of @xmath0 , @xmath52 gets saturated with @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "the diminished fluctuations in the pool of @xmath3 , @xmath54 is associated with the decaying pool of @xmath3 .",
    "also , we focus on the fano factor ( @xmath55 ) , which implies the amount of fluctuations for unity of molecules ( fig .  2(c ) ) .",
    "the fano factor of @xmath13 remains quite invariant over the range of signal establishing that switching of the response regulator in two phases ( @xmath3 and @xmath0 ) does not incorporate additional fluctuations in the molecular pool of @xmath13 .",
    "the central dogma of the molecular biology involves two steps - gene transcription , to produce mrna and further in turn translation , to protein . in the present work , we are interested in the zeroth - order @xmath0-regulated transcription from the operon of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the accumulation of the mrna pool is regulated by the first - order degradation of mrna .",
    "@xmath0 , activated from the phosphotransfer module , binds at the promoter in the form of a feedback with hill function kinetics , @xmath56 . here , @xmath20 (= @xmath57 @xmath58 m ) is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the transcription factor @xmath0 to the promoter .",
    "the hill coefficient @xmath59 , as considered in the current model , corresponds to a positive feedback without any cooperativity . to monitor the stochasticity introduced in the transcriptional kinetics , we quantitate the fluctuations in the pool of the mrna .",
    "3(a - c ) shows the statistical properties of mrna expression in response to the signal . for a wide range of signal the variance of mrna ,",
    "@xmath60 remains constant and is equal to the average , @xmath61 which makes fano factor equals to unity , a signature of poissonian statistics .",
    "we note that the equality relation between the variance and the mean value can be checked when both the quantities are expressed in copy numbers / cellular volume instead of concentration using the relation 1 m @xmath62 copy number / cellular volume .",
    "the overall statistical features observed in the mrna dynamics suggests that the feedback controlled autoregulation and subsequent transcription behave like a fluctuational buffer in the whole network . as a result",
    ", a weak information transmission occurs through the autoregulation module ( fig .",
    "3(d ) ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the motivation for considering the tcs motif as a signal transducer . to this end , it is crucial to quantify both the gain and the noise , not in isolation of them . to elucidate the network performance , we consider four different measures : network gain ( @xmath63 ) , intrinsic noise ( @xmath64 ) , signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , and gain - to - noise ratio ( gnr ) .",
    "the quantitative measures can be defined @xcite as follows , as the tcs cascade satisfies the spectral addition rule @xcite , @xmath65    the gain , defined here , is different from the macroscopic gain @xcite which characterises the fold increment in the observable output for a constant signal .",
    "the stochastic network gain is a qualitative measure about the uncertainty estimation of the network input when the uncertainty in the output is well known .",
    "the gnr gives a better insight on this quantity .",
    "it is important to note that the mutual information has an estimation from the reciprocal of the gnr . in fig .",
    "4(a ) the network gain for the current model is being illustrated with respect to the level of the inducer . at low signal strength ,",
    "the phosphotransfer reactions show determining role in the network , where the fluctuations level of both @xmath3 and @xmath0 grow .",
    "such growth implies the association of the randomness between inducer @xmath1 and both @xmath0 and @xmath3 increases .",
    "this association assists the elevation in the gain value . as the signal increases , the pool of the response regulator gets fully phosphorylated , and the fluctuations strength in the @xmath13 pool becomes constant . as a result , the gain and the gnr deplete ( fig .",
    "4(a),4(d ) ) .",
    "the intrinsic noise , explains the randomness within the system , usually occurs through the inherently probabilistic biochemical reactions .",
    "following the spectral addition rule fluctuations due to inducer ( @xmath66 ) has been eliminated from the fluctuations of the network output ( @xmath67 ) to purify the intrinsic noise of the tcs cascade ( eq .  ( [ eq14 ] ) ) .",
    "4(b ) shows the intrinsic noise profile as a function of inducer level .",
    "the intrinsic noise is nearly equal to @xmath52 ( shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) ) as the contribution of @xmath63 is minuscule for increasing signal strength .",
    "the snr is a good measure of the fidelity for a signaling network .",
    "better the snr , the better is the reliability of the cascade .",
    "the mutual information is the quotient of reliability , and it depends on the snr . in fig .",
    "4(c ) , we show the characteristic profile of snr vs. inducer .",
    "the notion of this plot is to decrypt the effective signal transmission through the signaling channel .",
    "the snr initially starts from a moderate value at a very low signal strength and maximises where the @xmath0 population reaches the maximum value . as a consequence of the sharp rise of the fluctuations in @xmath0 as well as the intrinsic noise , the snr experiences a quick decay . from the inclination of fidelity , it is to infer that the tcs shows maximum reliability at low to moderate level of the signal @xmath9 when the @xmath3 to @xmath0 transition rate is high .",
    "the functionality of a two - component system is to sense and respond appropriately to any extracellular signal . as we are considering the associated fluctuations in the signaling pathway , the quantitative reliability in terms of mutual information is to be measured . for a gaussian system ,",
    "the mutual information provides the channel capacity @xcite .",
    "considering the inducer ( @xmath1 ) as network input and phosphorylated response regulator ( @xmath0 ) as the output , one can quantify the mutual information @xmath68 between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the interplay between the signal and the network response can be verified when the association of the input - output fluctuations space is determined .",
    "according to the definition of shannon @xcite , for gaussian noise processes , the mutual information can be written as @xmath69    where the quantity @xmath70 measures the fidelity ( snr ) . in fig .",
    "2(d ) , we show mutual information as a function of the inducer level .",
    "the information processing by the tcs shows a sharp growth followed by a decaying nature . beyond a certain inducer level ,",
    "the mutual information profile goes down implying attainment of the steady state of the response regulator pool .",
    "since the phosphotransfer module plays the dominant role in the tcs cascade , the investigation for the two critical reactions : kinase and phosphatase within the frame of mutual information is crucial . in fig .  5",
    ", we show the contour map of fano factor and mutual information as a function of the phosphotransfer rate parameters : kinase , @xmath71 and phosphatase , @xmath72 . while the fano factor of @xmath0 measures the output fluctuations at the molecular level , @xmath68 quantitates the association between the input and output fluctuations level .",
    "so a comparative optimisation of the rate constants is executed here in the two maps . in fig .",
    "5(a ) , one can see that at very low phosphatase rate the fluctuations level in @xmath0 is maximum ; else it is quite low . in the same regime ,",
    "the information processing is very weak ( fig .",
    "the information processing maximises at a moderate phosphatase and high kinase level where the fluctuations level is remarkably low .",
    "this happens due to the low amount of @xmath0 at high phosphatase activity of the sensor protein , @xmath2 .    for the autoregulated transcription module",
    ", the mutual information of the noisy gene expression can be written as @xmath73    the fluctuations space associated with mrna shown in the profiles of variance and fano factor ( see figs .",
    "3(b , c ) ) is so narrow that the intersection of that with the fluctuations space of the inducer is minuscule .",
    "it gets also reflected in the profile of the mutual information @xmath74 in fig .",
    "3(d ) . with the enhancement of the signal strength , the information flow through the transcription reaction attenuates sharply .",
    "since the gene regulation and the transcription in this network play the role of a noise buffer , the sharp decrease in the information processing capacity is well justified .          in this section , we propose a numerical framework which explores the distribution of the phosphorylated response regulator protein at the steady state .",
    "the analysis of the two - component system ascribed above is within the purview of linear noise approximation .",
    "now , we want to extend the same network beyond the linear limit and examine some key features from the distribution profile . here , we observe the noise propagation through the autoregulation module under the control of the dissociation constant @xmath20 of the transcription factor @xmath0 at the promoter site , as different ranges of @xmath20 shows different probability distributions for a particular signal strength ( fig .",
    "6(a - e ) ) .    as the dissociation constant @xmath20 is the ratio of the two rate constants : the unbinding ( @xmath75 ) and the binding ( @xmath76 ) rate of the transcription factor , the variation in @xmath20 drives the full regulated expression through the alteration in the promoter kinetics . at lower @xmath20-value ,",
    "binding of @xmath0 to the promoter is more stable , and the duration of the ` on ' state of the promoter is much larger than the ` off ' state .",
    "hence , the transcription reaction incorporates lesser fluctuations in further proceedings . with the increment of @xmath20 the time scales of the ` on ' and the ` off ' state of the promoter appears to be comparable . as a result",
    ", two separate regime appears in the transcription timing , and this intrinsic stochasticity introduces distinct bimodality in the population of @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of the weak nonlinearity in @xmath77 for positive feedback shows a zero - order ultrasensitivity , which always produces single - valued steady - state concentration , i.e. monostability , when characterised deterministically without noise .",
    "but the numerical simulation of the stochastic model explores the stability switch which produces multi - valued steady state , i.e. , bimodality . in fig .",
    "6(f ) , one can see that the bimodal population of @xmath0 exists within a very narrow range of @xmath20 . at the exterior of this range ,",
    "the distribution is unimodal at the low or the high population .",
    "if we denote the small copy number state as the persisters , that frequently occurs in a bacterial population , the sharp switch between the two states must have an evolutionary and survival fate .",
    "the present study reports a theoretical analysis of signal transduction in bacterial two - component signalling pathway using a stochastic framework .",
    "the theoretical study makes a detailed discussion of the fluctuations propagation in the presence of an external signal .",
    "we find that the switching of the response regulator in its two states can not produce more randomness in the protein pool but the observed fluctuations appear to be conveyed through the cascade .",
    "the observed poissonian feature in mrna pool predicts the transcription system with weak bursts and less noise generation .",
    "our analysis also checks the reliability of the network in information processing . to this end",
    ", the fidelity of the network is examined through the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "our results suggest that the complete network has high efficiency at moderately low level of the signal . in this context , the modular structure of the network is being analysed .",
    "the phosphotransfer module takes the leading role in the propagation of fluctuations and information compared to the autoregulation module .",
    "the traditional metrics like variance and fano factor measures the noise strength in the network but is unable to guess how fluctuations affect the process of information transmission . to take care of this issue , we focus on the signalling fidelity . given the network gain and the intrinsic noise as two antagonistic metrics",
    ", an efficient network always tries to maximise the gain at the minimal inherent randomness .",
    "a multi - objective trade - off between these two different parameters makes a network more robust against the external stimulus .",
    "the recent advent of experimental techniques facilitates the measure of cellular and molecular fluctuations along with the information flow .",
    "the tcs , a minimal example of the bacterial communication system , harvests reliable information transmission while making a cellular decision .",
    "the regulation of gene expression is the most crucial physiological function to be decided .",
    "but in the case of complex interconnected genetic networks , it is hard to decipher the exact path of noise incorporation or information flow .",
    "the modular approach to systems biology at single cell level may help in addressing this issue .",
    "the investigation of single - cell behaviour may also reveal the noise - driven bifurcation of a monoclonal population and the existence of a sharp switch between the phenotypes .",
    "this switching mechanism may evolve to adapt in an adverse environment . rather than an evolutionary pressure",
