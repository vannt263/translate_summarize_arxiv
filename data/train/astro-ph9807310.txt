    "how is this conversion effected ?",
    "an answer to this may lie in the physics of streaming instabilities . in the context of plasma physics , interpenetrating electron beams produce the two - stream instability@xmath7 whose gravitational analog has long been recognized , beginning with the investigations of sweet@xmath8 and lynden - bell.@xmath9 of course , in the case of galaxy collisions , which occur quickly , the conventional two - stream instability may operate too slowly to be effective .",

    "the present venture into the asymmetric problem is intended to focus on the possibility of well - separated instability bands , which has not been elucidated in the gravitational context , as far as we are aware .",
    "to see the problem in its simplest version , it is useful to have a uniform medium as the unperturbed state . rather than formulate the problem inconsistently to achieve this end , as jeans did , we prefer the einstein device of introducing a cosmological repulsion term . in the newtonian",

    "there are many clear instances where the dynamics of interpenetrating fluids may play a role in developing structures , but we close here by suggesting that even when the streaming is not apparent , two - stream dynamics may be relevant .",
    "an interesting example is provided by the coexistence of dark matter and luminous ( baryonic ) matter that is generally believed to occur throughout the cosmos .",
