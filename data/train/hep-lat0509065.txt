    "electric and magnetic polarizabilities are fundamental properties of hadrons .",
    "they determine the dynamical response ( deformation ) of a hadron to external electromagnetic fields , and provide valuable and sensitive information about the internal strong interaction structure of the hadron as a composite particle . in @xcite , the results of a lattice calculation of hadron electric polarizability for neutral hadrons , based on the methods of @xcite , has been presented . in this work , we will focus on the first calculation of hadron magnetic polarizability from lattice qcd .",
    "our aim is to present the lattice data in sufficient detail in order to facilitate comparison with existing information in this area .",
    "traditionally , the symbol @xmath32 is used to represent the electric dipole polarizability , and @xmath33 for the magnetic dipole polarizability .",
    "a considerable number of experiments have been performed with the aim of measuring nucleon polarizabilities .",
    "most of these have specifically targeted the proton , some attempts have also been made at measuring the neutron polarizabilities .",
    "the experimental values are listed in tables [ table : proton ] and [ table : neutron ] .",
    ".a list of electric and magnetic polarizabilities in units of @xmath34 @xmath35 for the proton from recent experiments .",

    "in this work we have presented the results of the first lattice calculation of hadron magnetic polarizabilities .",
    "hadron masses were extracted from fits to baryon and meson two - point correlation functions at six different quark masses and four different nonzero magnetic fields .",
    "magnetic polarizabilities of hadrons were extracted from the hadron mass shifts induced by the presence of an external uniform magnetic field .",
    "the bulk of our results are based on 150 configurations on a @xmath0 lattice at a spacing of about 0.1 fm and pion mass down to about 500 mev , using the standard wilson actions .",
    "the clover quark action was also used as a check . in both cases ,",
    "clear signals for hadron magnetic polarizabilities are seen and the calculated results from wilson and clover quark actions are generally in good agreement with each other .",
    "we investigated 30 particles sweeping through the baryon octet and decuplet and selected mesons .",
    "most of the polarizabilities have not been measured , except for the nucleon and pion , so most of our results are predictions . aside from the figures ,",
    "the results are tabulated in three separate tables .",
    "below is a summary of the main results of the calculation .",
    "our value for the proton magnetic polarizability agrees reasonably with the most recent world average value of about @xmath36 in units of @xmath34 @xmath35 , but suffers from relatively large errors . our value for the neutron magnetic polarizability ( about 15 to 20 ) , which has smaller errors , is much greater than the world average value .",
    "this large difference between the proton and the neutron on the lattice is an interesting result that is worth further study .    in the decuplet sector",
    ", the most interesting result is the large and negative magnetic polarizability ( about @xmath37 ) for the @xmath13 .",
    "theoretical explanations , such as those from chiral effective theories , are called for .",
    "the @xmath38 value of @xmath39 is a prediction free of uncertainty from chiral extrapolations , and can be directly compared with experiment .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath38 magnetic polarizability is greatly desired .    between the octet and the decuplet , we observe the following pattern .",
    "positively - charged @xmath3 and @xmath6 have relatively small and positive values , albeit with large errors , a situation opposite to that for the decuplet members @xmath12 and @xmath16 which have negative and slightly larger values along with smaller errors .",
    "it is important to increase the statistics to obtain a better signal for the @xmath3 and @xmath6 on the lattice to confirm this difference .",
    "in addition , the charge - neutral particles have values on the order of @xmath40 , while the negatively - charged particles on the order of @xmath41 .    in the meson sector",
    ", we confirmed the expected result that a positively - charged particle has identical magnetic polarizability as its negatively - charged partner ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "all charged mesons have negative magnetic polarizabilities , and all neutral mesons have positive ones . in terms of magnitude , the pseudoscalar mesons have about twice as large values as the vector mesons .",
    "futhermore , the vector mesons have a weaker quark mass dependence than the pseudoscalar mesons",
    ".    taken as a whole , our results demonstrate the efficacy of the methods used in computing the magnetic polarizabilities on the lattice .",
    "in addition to increasing statistics to the 300 to 500 configurations range , further studies should focus on assessing the systematic uncertainties .",
    "first , finite - volume effects must be investigated by changing the lattice size or lattice spacing .",
    "this is particularly relevant considering the fact that the dipole magnetic polarizability is a volume effect ( in units of @xmath35 ) .",
    "calculations on a larger lattice @xmath46 are under way .",
    "another volume is needed to perform a continuum extrapolation .    next , a chiral extrapolation is needed to provide better comparison with experiment and other approaches . to facilitate the chiral extrapolation , on the one hand , we need to perform calculations at smaller pion masses .",
    "this is hard to achieve with the standard wilson quark action due to technical difficulties .",
    "an attractive alternate is the so - called twisted - mass quark action  @xcite which can push the pion mass down to about 250 mev at a cost of about factor of two . to further decrease the pion mass",
    ", one needs chiral fermions such as the overlap  @xcite which has been used to push the pion mass down to about 180 mev  @xcite .",
    "the downside of overlap fermions is its cost : it is much more expensive to simulate than the standard wilson fermions .",
    "on the other hand , we need better ansatz from chiral effective theories to provide a physical basis for the extrapolations .",
    "third , the effects of the quenched approximation should be investigated .",
    "work is currently under way using the cp - pacs dynamical configurations  @xcite based on the renormalization - group improved gauge action and mean - field improved clover quark action .",
    "the three lattice sizes in the set are useful for doing a continuum extrapolation .",
    "finally , as far as the cost of our calculation is concerned , it is equivalent to 11 standard mass - spectrum calculations using the same action ( 5 values of the parameter @xmath47 to provide 4 non - zero magnetic fields , 5 to reverse the field , plus the zero - field to set the baseline ) .",
    "this factor can be reduced to 7 if only two non - zero values of magnetic field are desired . reversing the field is well worth the cost :",
    "the magnetic moments can be extracted from the linear response in the mass shifts in the same data set  @xcite .",
