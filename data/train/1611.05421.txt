    "quasars are powered by the infall of gas into the gravitational potential well of super - massive black holes , residing at the center of distant galaxies . the infall of gas occurs , preferentially , through the so - called _ cold flows _ along the filaments of the cosmic web @xcite that are predicted by simulations @xcite .",
    "these cold flows of low metallicity gas can also feed and trigger star formation activities in the host galaxies , hence , enriching their interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "strong agn - driven outflows , on the other hand , are required to regulate and quench star formation activities , and also prevent overgrowth of the galaxy ( and the central black hole ) by ejecting the available material back into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and/or circum - galactic medium ( cgm ; @xcite ) .",
    "luminous quasars are capable of launching powerful and energetic outflows of gas up to very large distances .",
    "the pristine infalling gas can therefore merge with the enriched outflowing material anywhere from the innermost region of the agn to the outermost region of the halo of the host galaxy .",
    "when the infalling and outflowing gas collide , they get mixed , shocked and compressed to a high density , probably for a short period , before getting evaporated by the incident energetic outflows @xcite . if a line of sight to the central agn passes through this shocked material , one would expect to detect a strong hi absorption in the spectrum with @xmath4(hi )  @xmath10  10@xmath11  @xmath5 at the redshift of the quasar @xcite .    since the gas is compressed to a very small size",
    ", it may not fully cover the broad emission line region ( belr ) of the quasar .",
    "therefore , for any given neutral hydrogen column density , there could be a combination of the cloud projected angular size and its relative velocity from the agn for which the partial coverage is such that the leaked emission from the ly@xmath0 belr could almost fully fill the strong ( or damped ) ly@xmath0 absorption trough .",
    "if this happens , one would not detect the corresponding ly@xmath0 absorption in the quasar spectrum .",
    "so far , no such combination of dla size and relative velocity ( from the agn ) has ever been found along quasars sightlines .",
    "for the first time , in this letter , we report the discovery of such a ghostly dla cloud along the line of sight to the quasar sdss  j113341.29@xmath2005740.0 ( here after j1133@xmath20057 ) .",
    "the presence of this dla is revealed through the detection of absorption lines from neutral ( e.g. c  i or na  i ) and low - ion species associated with it .",
    "this absorber is part of the @xcite sample .",
    "these authors systematically looked for ci absorption in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar spectra in a search for cold gas at high redshift .",
    "we show that the cloud is compressed to a very small size , and is located very close to the central agn .",
    "we argue that proximity to the quasar s central engine , and small physical dimension are the common characteristics of ghostly dlas .",
    "ghostly dlas are important objects as ( by definition ) they always show signature of negligible covering factor of at least the ly@xmath0 belr , and probably probe the innermost regions of the agns .",
    "current surveys of dlas miss this class of objects as their employed techniques to find dlas rely at least partly on the fact that the residual flux at the bottom of the dla reaches zero intensity @xcite , which is not the case in this new class of dlas .",
    "therefore , we might actually be witnessing the tip of an iceberg as new techniques based on metal absorption line templates would probably find more of these ghostly dlas in the sdss spectroscopic database .",
    "the spectrum of the quasar sdss j1133@xmath20057 was taken on 2011 january 7 , using the xshooter spectrograph @xcite mounted on the very large telescope in the course of a program to search for cold gas using neutral carbon ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the spectrum covers the wavelength range from 3000   to 2.5  @xmath12 m with the nominal resolving power of r  =  4350 , 7450 , and 5300 in the uvb , vis , and nir arms , respectively , corresponding to slit widths of 1.0 , 0.9 and 0.9 arcsec .",
    "we used the eso pipeline v2.5.2 to reduce the raw spectrum .",
    "the 11@xmath13-long slit of the spectrograph provided us with enough spatial pixels free of quasar emission , to perform optimal sky subtraction .",
    "arc lamp spectra were used for wavelength calibration , and the spectrum of a standard star observed during the same night was used to flux calibrate the spectrum .",
    "we detect a metal absorption line system in the spectrum of the quasar j1133@xmath20057 , with an absorption redshift coincident with the emission redshift of the quasar .",
    "the presence of species like ci , cli , mgi , and especially nai suggests that the absorber has a high neutral hydrogen column density and is probably a dla @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ j1133_1d ] , no apparent dla absorption line is detected in the spectrum at the redshift of the low ion species , i.e. @xmath14  =   1.70465 .",
    "if one assumes that the ly@xmath0 belr of the quasar is only partially covered by the dla , then the leaked ly@xmath0 emission from the belr could fill the dla absorption trough and prevent direct detection .",
    "we show below that this is indeed the case , and we demonstrate that the shallow absorption dip seen around 3300   in the spectrum is actually a ghostly signature of an otherwise strong dla absorption ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "this shallow absorption feature allows us to constrain the hi column density of this elusive dla .",
    "we detect [ oii]@xmath153728 , ly@xmath0 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath16 , and h@xmath17 emission lines associated with the quasar , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hbalmeroii ] . a gaussian function fitted to the [ oii ] emission line doublet gives @xmath18  =  1.70441@xmath70.00011 , which is adopted as the systemic redshift of the quasar .",
    "we simultaneously fit a 2-component gaussian function on the hydrogen balmer emission lines , and obtain @xmath19  =  1.70668@xmath70.00002 , fwhm@xmath20  =  2344  kms@xmath21 and @xmath22  =  1.70272@xmath70.00005 , fwhm@xmath23  =  6048  kms@xmath21 as the redshift and fwhm of the narrow and broad components of the fit , respectively ( see fig.[hbalmeroii ] ) .",
    "c    c    l      as mentioned earlier , the dla absorption trough is almost completely filled with the leaked emission from the belr of the quasar . in this section ,",
    "we model the ly@xmath0 and nv emission lines from the belr , and predict the amount of neutral hydrogen that is needed to reproduce the shape of the observed spectrum in the ly@xmath0 spectral region . in our models , we assume that the ly@xmath0 and nv emission lines are each composed of a narrow and a broad component , similar to what is seen for h - balmer lines ( see section  3.1 ) . during calculations , the redshift of the dla is fixed to the value obtained for the main component of the low - ion species ( @xmath14  =  1.70465 ) .",
    "below , we briefly explain how the reconstruction is performed .",
    "first , we define the quasar s reddened continuum as a power law function with @xmath0  =  + 1.5 .",
    "the power law index , @xmath0 , is obtained by fitting the quasar continuum observed at 3700 , 4300 , and 4660  .",
    "the broad component of ly@xmath0 ( dashed green curve in fig .",
    "[ dlamodels ] ) and nv ( dashed pink curve ) bel are then added to this continuum to produce the spectrum seen by the dla cloud . the resulting spectrum after passing through the dla is shown as a blue curve in fig .",
    "[ dlamodels ] . here",
    ", we assume that the covering factor of the broad component of these emission lines is 1.0 .",
    "the final simulated spectrum , which is shown as a red curve in fig .  [ dlamodels ] , is obtained by adding to the blue curve the narrow components of the ly@xmath0 and nv bel profiles , which are assumed to have covering factor of 0.0 .",
    "we first tried to reconstruct the observed spectrum with the maximum number of fixed parameters .",
    "the result is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ dlamodels ] , and the parameters of the fit are listed in the third column of table  [ dlamodelstable ] . in this model ,",
    "the redshifts and the widths of the emission lines were fixed to those of the h - balmer lines .",
    "the hi column density and the amplitude of the emission lines are the only free parameters in this model .",
    "the final fit , which is shown as a red curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ dlamodels ] , has a reduced chi - square of @xmath24  =  16.25 and does not match the observed spectrum very well especially near the blue wing of the ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "we , therefore , tried to construct a second model in which we also relax the redshift and the width of the blr ly@xmath0 emission line components .",
    "the result of this new model , which now fits the observed spectrum more satisfactorily with @xmath25  =  0.47 , is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ dlamodels ] , and the parameters of the fit are listed in the fourth column of table  [ dlamodelstable ] .",
    "this model converges with log@xmath4(hi )  =  21.0 .",
    "we also checked that hi column densities smaller than 20.70 and larger than 21.30 results in fits with large @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , in this work , we adopt log@xmath4(hi )  =  21.0@xmath70.3 .",
    "we emphasize that the hi column density is not very sensitive to the choice of the free parameters , thanks to the presence of the shallow dip seen around 3300 , which strongly constrains the hi column density to be @xmath610@xmath26@xmath5 .",

    "below , we constrain the dla size using the physical state of the gas derived from the observation of the c  i fine structure transitions",
    ".    the observed column density ratios of the ci multiplet populations detected in the dla are @xmath4(ci@xmath41)/@xmath4(ci )  @xmath6  2.88 and @xmath4(ci@xmath42)/@xmath4(ci )  @xmath6  2.75 .",
    "the high values of these ratios imply that the fine structure states are thermalized in the cloud .",
    "as shown in figure  11 of @xcite , the level populations at low densities ( i.e. @xmath43  @xmath44  1000  @xmath45 ) depend on the strength of the incident radiation field , @xmath46 .",
    "we extend their calculations to higher values of @xmath46 and find that to match the observations , a radiation field with an intensity of @xmath46  =  1.4  @xmath47  10@xmath48  erg  s@xmath21@xmath5hz@xmath21sr@xmath21 is needed . on the other hand , if the density of the gas is high enough ( e.g. @xmath43  @xmath10  1000  @xmath45 ) , then collisional excitation alone will be sufficient to thermalize the system . in this case , the presence of the incident radiation field will have no further effect on the population of the fine structure states .",
    "if @xmath46 were known , this would in principle allow us to constrain the density , @xmath43 . here , we follow the technique introduced by @xcite ( 2003 ; see also @xcite ) , using the cii@xmath41 optical depth , to estimate an upper limit to the intensity of the radiation field , @xmath46 , to which the dla gas is exposed . since cii and cii@xmath41 absorption lines are saturated in the spectrum , we assume [ c / h ]  =  [ s / h ] and obtain log@xmath4(cii )  =  17.02 .",
    "we further assume @xmath4(cii@xmath41)/@xmath4(cii )  @xmath8  2.0 ( see upper panel of figure  4 in @xcite ) and get log@xmath4(cii@xmath41 )  @xmath8  17.32 .",
    "the radiation field intensity , @xmath46 , is determined by assuming a steady state condition and equating the heating rate , @xmath49 , with the cooling rate , @xmath50 .",
    "the heating rate is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath53 , the grains heating efficiency , and @xmath46 , the intensity of the radiation field in erg  s@xmath21@xmath5hz@xmath21sr@xmath21 .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio is calculated using equation  7 of @xcite . with minimal depletion model ,",
    "we get @xmath54  =  0.30 while maximal depletion model results in @xmath55  =  0.48 . in this work",
    ", we adopt the mean value of @xmath52  =  0.39 .",
    "depending on the temperature of the cloud , the grains heating efficiency , @xmath53 , varies between 0.05 and 0.09 ( @xcite , see their figure1 ) . adopting @xmath53  =  0.07 as in @xcite , and using equation  1",
    ", we obtain the heating rate as @xmath49  =  2.73  @xmath47  10@xmath56@xmath46 .",
    "the cooling rate , on the other hand , is @xmath50  =  2.89@xmath4710@xmath57@xmath4(cii@xmath58)/@xmath4(hi )  @xmath6  7.59@xmath4710@xmath59 erg  s@xmath21  h@xmath21 . by equating the cooling rate with the heating rate ,",
    "we get @xmath602.78@xmath4710@xmath29erg  s@xmath21@xmath5hz@xmath21sr@xmath21 as an upper limit to the intensity of the radiation field that is impinging upon the dla cloud .",
    "this value of @xmath46 is @xmath65 times lower than what is needed to thermalize the ci fine structure levels ( see above ) , implying that these fine structure states are thermalized predominantly through collisional excitation .    with the above limit on @xmath46 , the observed @xmath4(ci@xmath41)/@xmath4(ci ) and",
    "@xmath4(ci@xmath42)/@xmath4(ci ) ratios can be reproduced _ only _ when @xmath61  >  1000  @xmath45 .",
    "this results in a characteristic size of the cloud of @xmath62  =  @xmath4(hi)/@xmath43  @xmath63  0.32  pc .",
    "one can also use the quasar luminosity , @xmath64 ( = 2.28@xmath4710@xmath65  erg  s@xmath21hz@xmath21 ) , to derive from the upper value on @xmath46 a lower limit of @xmath66  @xmath9  66  pc for the dla - quasar separation .",
    "grains in the dla clouds are mainly heated by photons with energy @xmath67  =  6@xmath213.6  ev @xcite .",
    "as these photons can reach deeper into the cloud , they are absorbed by dust .",
    "when this extinction by dust grains is taken into account , the lower limit to the dla - quasar separation decreases to @xmath66  @xmath9  39  pc .",
    "we reported the discovery of the first ghostly dla found along the line of sight to the quasar sdss j1133@xmath20057 .",
    "no ly@xmath0 absorption line is seen in the quasar spectrum at the redshift of the detected low - ion species such as ci , nai , caii , etc because the leaked emission from the ly@xmath0 belr fills the dla absorption trough .",
    "the dla cloud is small ( @xmath80.32  pc ) , and is located at @xmath66  @xmath9  39  pc from the central agn thus not covering entirely the broad line region .",
    "interestingly , this ghostly dla has characteristics similar to those of the eclipsing dla found along the line of sight to the quasar j0823@xmath680529 ( fathivavsari et al .",
    "both dlas have very small sizes and are located close to the central agn .",
    "however , in contrast to the newly found ghostly dla , the eclipsing dla towards j0823@xmath680529 shows strong dla absorption profile in the quasar spectrum .",
    "this implies that the eclipsing dla , with a transverse size of 2.3@xmath8@xmath62(hi)@xmath89.1pc , blocks most of the radiation emitted by the quasar belr . because of the sub - parsec size of the ghostly dla , most emission from the quasar ly@xmath0 belr is freely passing by the dla and consequently filling the dla absorption trough , resulting in the observed spectral profile shown in fig .  [ dlamodels ] .",
    "it could be possible that the two ( ghostly and eclipsing ) dlas are from the same population and are just two stages of the same flow .",
    "eclipsing dlas could turn into ghostly dlas as strong outflowing material from the central agn strikes and compresses them into clouds of smaller size and higher density .",
    "statistical study of a large sample of ghostly and eclipsing dlas would in principle allow us to confirm whether there is any connection between the two absorbers , and what importance they have over the whole dla population .",
