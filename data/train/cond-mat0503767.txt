    "<S> , we observe the different trend in _ overdoped _ bi-2212 ( having @xmath35  k ) , namely a change in csw that is compatible , in sign and magnitude , with the predictions of the bcs theory  @xcite . we observe that going from the overdoped to the underdoped regime , the sc - induced change in csw is actually progressive , going through zero not far from optimum doping . </S>",
    "<S> this progressive change strongly suggests that there is in the cuprates a smooth transition from a conventional mode of condensation in the overdoped regime to an unconventional mode in the underdoped one  @xcite .    in conclusion , whereas the data presented by boris and colleagues  @xcite on _ nearly optimally - doped cuprates _ actually _ agree _ with previous work in underdoped to optimally doped cuprates , their conclusions are flawed by an incorrect or model - dependent data analysis . </S>",
