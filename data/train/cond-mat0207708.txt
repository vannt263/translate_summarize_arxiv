    "it was recently shown that in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 the realization of an insulating and ferromagnetic ground state for @xmath7 results from a superexchange ( se ) driven rearrangement of the high - temperature orbital order ( oo ) established by the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion.@xcite upon sr - doping the jt distortion in the parent compound gets suppressed and the degeneracy of the mn@xmath6 e@xmath8 electrons becomes almost restored . in this case the two - orbital model by kugel and khomskii becomes valid and ferromagnetic se interactions between mn@xmath6 ions show up.@xcite these drive the system into an orbitally ordered and ferromagnetic state .",

    "hence , the lamn@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 system is a promising candidate for studying the close relationship between jt distortion , se interactions and orbital degeneracy , especially because in the simple ionic picture the mn@xmath6 ( 3d@xmath13 ) ions are partially substituted by isoelectronic cr@xmath6 ions ( 3d@xmath14 ) , which have the same electronic configuration as mn@xmath15 ( e.g.  t@xmath16 ) in these compounds . therefore no mobile charge carriers should be present in contrast to the sr - doped case .",

    "two main reasons account for the different behavior of cr@xmath6 and mn@xmath15 ions ( both are not jt active ) : firstly , the ionic radius of the cr@xmath6 ion is larger than the corresponding one of the mn@xmath15 ion and hence the destabilization of the mn@xmath6 jahn - teller matrix is weaker than in the sr - doped samples .",
    "additionally , the mobile nature of the induced charge carriers ( holes ) in the case of sr - doping allows for a dynamical change of the local electronic configuration and a homogenous distribution of the mn@xmath15 ions in the jt matrix , whereas the cr@xmath6 ions are fixed to the lattice sites at the time of sample preparation .",

    "unfortunately , in the case of polycrystalline samples such a detailed analysis is not possible due to the random orientation of the powder .",

    "thus , we fitted the linewidth data for all samples under investigation by using eq .  1 ( see fig .  7 ) , which can neither describe the critical broadening of the linewidth in the vicinity of a magnetic transition nor the structural transition at @xmath95 , but fits very nicely in between these transitions . the obtained parameters @xmath47 and @xmath94 are shown in fig .",

    "moreover @xmath94 shows the same behavior as the linewidth values taken at 450 k ( see inset of fig .",
    "7 ) , confirming that the maximum linewidth is a good measure for the strength of the interactions .",
    "the difference in @xmath94 observed between the o@xmath4 and the o - phase is due to the fact that concomitantly with the disappearance of the cooperative jt effect the contribution of the single - ion anisotropy of the cf vanishes at @xmath95 whereas the dm contribution is due to the tilting of the octahedra , which for lamno@xmath77 has been shown to remain nearly unchanged through the transition.@xcite    the obtained values in both phases are in agreement with those reported for la@xmath0ca@xmath97mno@xmath77 and lamno@xmath25 of @xmath98 koe for the o@xmath4-phase and @xmath99 koe for the o phase yielding values of the order of 1 k for both interaction.@xcite    the influence of de on the esr linewidth in the paramagnetic regime is not fully understood and still subject of controversial discussion : shengelaya _ _ et al .  _ _ found that in la@xmath100ca@xmath101mno@xmath77 , where the cooperative jt distortion is already suppressed , the temperature dependence of the linewidth correlates with the conductivity and both parameters can be described by a small - polaron hopping model @xmath102 with similar activation energies @xmath103.@xcite in contrast , in the optimally doped region @xmath104 the linewidth has been described previously by eq .",
    "( [ dhdm ] ) only.@xcite some authors argue that due to the different time scales the de interaction , which manifests itself in the paramagnetic phase through the hopping of the jt polaron , can not have any effect on the spin relaxation.@xcite however , we want to emphasize that in our case the linewidth can be satisfactorily described without any additional relaxation process connected to polaron hopping .      though all observed parameters show a close correlation to the structural changes induced upon cr - doping , the origin of the observed ferromagnetic component of the magnetization can not easily be explained . from the values of the high - field magnetization ( 5 t )",
    "we deduce that the magnetic phase is not purely ferromagnetic , since the deviation from the theoretical values of @xmath105 for the full magnetic moment of all mn@xmath6 and cr@xmath6 spins can not be attributed to temperature induced disorder , only .",
    "therefore , we have to consider all exchange interactions between the mn@xmath6 and cr@xmath6 ions that could contribute to the magnetic state of the system :    in the parent compound lamno@xmath77 the jt distortion lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath106 orbitals and the mn@xmath6- o - mn@xmath6 se interaction yields antiferromagnetic coupling along the _ c_-axis and ferromagnetic coupling in the _ ab_-plane . in the case of degenerated @xmath106 orbitals , the kanamori - goodenough rules @xcite do not apply and the two - orbital kugel - khomskii model yields a purely ferromagnetic mn@xmath6- o - mn@xmath6 se interaction.@xcite due to the weakening of the jt distortion upon cr - doping",
    ", the degeneracy of the @xmath106 orbitals can become almost restored ( similar to the ferromagnetic insulating state of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath77 ) and favor ferromagnetism ( fm ) .",
    "taking into account the kanamori - goodenough rules @xcite the mn@xmath6- o - cr@xmath6 superexchange is ferromagnetic and therefore can also account for the increasing values of @xmath47 in the o@xmath4-phase with increasing cr - doping .",
    "correspondingly , the antiferromagnetic cr@xmath6- o - cr@xmath6 superexchange should contribute considerably with increased cr content and could account for the stabilization of the magnetic state for @xmath96 , where the observed parameters become almost constant .",
    "finally , a de interaction between mn@xmath6- o - cr@xmath6 ions has been proposed.@xcite    regarding the existence of de , we can compare our data to observations of prado _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in lamno@xmath25 , where one can clearly see the impact of mn@xmath15 - o - mn@xmath6 double exchange on the magnetic properties : though the hysteresis loops show a similar behavior upon increasing oxygen surplus as upon cr - doping , the magnetic phase transition from afm to fm at @xmath107 is characterized by the appearance of the full magnetic moment of @xmath105 these features are also found upon doping with sr.@xcite how difficult it is to distinguish the involved interactions from the dc magnetization data only can be seen in comparison with the behavior of @xmath46 vs.  @xmath35 in electron doped ca@xmath0la@xmath1mno@xmath2,@xcite which looks very similar to our system .",

    "astonishingly , we also observe that in contrast to ca / sr - doped lamno@xmath2 , where the esr signal has been attributed to both mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath15 ions , @xcite the esr signal in the paramagnetic regime seems to be originated by the mn@xmath6 ions only ( see fig .",
    "3 ) : the effective moments determined by esr follow the theoretical curve for mn@xmath6 up to @xmath38 very nicely . the corresponding values from the magnetization measurements , however , are slightly enhanced in comparison to the esr data , but the overall tendency is similar .",
    "in contrast to the squid measurements ( see inset of fig .",

    "<S> a transition from the jahn - teller distorted o@xmath4 to the pseudocubic o phase occurs between @xmath5 . a clear connection between this transition and the doping dependence of the magnetic and esr properties has been observed . </S>",
