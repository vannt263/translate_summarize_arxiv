    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> they occur between the time - dependent eigenstates of quantum systems driven by time - dependent forces and are often interpreted as signature of dissipative processes @xcite . in this letter , we investigate their connection to dissipation within the framework of quantum fluctuation relations such as the quantum jarzynski relation @xcite .    in an open system driven by a time - dependent force , </S>",
    "<S> the second law states that dissipation or entropy production is the sum of the change in the system von neumann entropy , plus the heat entering the reservoir divided by its initial temperature which represents the change in entropy in the reservoir if it were ideal ( i.e. always at equilibrium ) . </S>",

    "<S> a reversible transformation occurs when entropy production can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> there are different ways to generate such transformations . </S>",
    "<S> one consists in slowly driving an open system weakly coupled to an ideal reservoir so that it will remain at any time very close to equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> since heat and entropy change are identical to first order away from equilibrium , entropy production is of second order and thus negligible . </S>",
    "<S> no notion of qm - adiabaticity enters at this level . </S>",
    "<S> another way consists in detaching the system from the reservoir and only consider a driven isolated system where the unitary dynamics leaves the system von - neumann entropy invariant and where no heat is exchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the second law is then empty and the first law trivial ( the energy change is the mechanical work done by the driving ) . once again </S>",
    "<S> , qm - adiabaticity plays no role here .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the framework of the quantum jarzynski relation derived for driven isolated systems initially prepared in a canonical equilibrium ( using for instance a weak interaction with an ideal reservoir which is removed when the driving starts acting ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , fluctuations in entropy production are expressed as dissipative work ( i.e. the mechanical work minus the difference in equilibrium free energy difference corresponding to the final and the initial system hamiltonian ) . but </S>",
    "<S> this dissipation actually only occurs if one reconnects the system to its reservoir after the driving ends . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in this framework , we are actually dealing with a specific class of driven open systems where the driving and the relaxation phase occur separately . </S>",
    "<S> the first phase is the driven nondissipative dynamics that brings the isolated system to a nonequilibrium state at the expense of mechanical work . </S>",
    "<S> the second is the nondriven dissipative dynamics starting at the end of the first phase when the system is reconnected to the ideal reservoir and ending when it has reached equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dissipation is the relative entropy distance between the nonequilibrium state produced at the end of the first phase and the equilibrium state reached at the end of the second one which equals the dissipative work @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a special situation occurs if we consider a cyclic driving . </S>",
    "<S> if during the first phase the dynamics is qm - adiabatic , the final state of the system will coincide with its initial equilibrium state , and no dissipation will occur during reconnection . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a cyclic driving generating qm - diabatic transitions , this will not be the case and dissipation will ensue . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , for cyclic drivings the absence of dissipation is directly linked to qm - adiabaticity . for non - cyclic drivings </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different . </S>",
    "<S> whether or not the transformation is qm - adiabatic , a final nonequilibrium states will generically be produced . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dissipation has thus again little to do with the amount of qm - diabatic transitions .    to establish an explicit expression relating dissipation to lz transitions , we need to go beyond these frameworks and consider driven systems coupled to reservoirs made of a finite number of levels initially at equilibrium . as the driving moves the system levels </S>",

    "<S> as usual , @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the reservoir temperature and chemical potential . as the system level is raised , consecutive avoided crossings between the system level and the reservoir levels will occur ( see fig </S>",

    "<S> is denoted @xmath12 and is assumed to remain constant until the next crossing @xmath13 ( i.e. the raising speed varies slowly between adjacent crossings ) . </S>",
    "<S> the time to go from crossing @xmath11 to @xmath13 is thus given by @xmath14 and the time at which the crossing with level @xmath11 occurs is @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> the evolution of the system occupation can therefore be rewritten as a markov chain with transition probabilities at the crossing @xmath11 , @xmath31 to empty the system level by filling the reservoir one , and @xmath32 to fill the system level and empty the reservoir one @xmath33    we proceed with two important remarks . </S>",
    "<S> first , the state of the reservoir changes as the system level sequentially crosses its levels . </S>",
    "<S> second , our stochastic model neglects the coherences generated by the quantum dynamics  @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , our scheme is expected to hold as long as a given reservoir level is not crossed twice . </S>",
    "<S> in this way , its nonequilibrium state and its coherences resulting from the first interaction will not influence the system dynamics anymore .    </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ occup.fig ] , where we compare the system occupation predicted by our stochastic dynamics ( [ stoch - dyn ] ) with that predicted using a numerically exact system - reservoir quantum mechanical calculation , which is performed as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian used is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the site - energy for the dot , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are its creation and destruction operators and @xmath38 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> the system level and the @xmath1 level ( with creation and destruction operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) are coupled with a strength @xmath41 such that the gaps between the levels are given by @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> since this is a non - interacting many - body - system , all its properties can be obtained from single - body quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we thus numerically solved its exact dynamics by mapping the time - dependent single - body schrdinger equation into a system of ordinary differential equations , using a runge - kutta method ( rk4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider two important limiting regimes of the dynamics ( [ stoch - dyn ] ) . the _ qm - adiabatic regime </S>",
    "<S> _ occurs for slow driving rates @xmath43 when no lz transition occurs because @xmath44 and as a result @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , the system instantaneously thermalizes by exchanging its probability with the reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> if before the crossing the system is occupied with probability @xmath47 and the reservoir level with probability @xmath48 , then after the crossing the system occupation becomes @xmath49 and the reservoir one @xmath47 . in turn , the _ qm - diabatic regime _ occurs for fast driving rates in terms of lz theory @xmath50 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a lz transition always occurs at the crossing because @xmath51 and as a result @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the system and the reservoir thus remain unaffected by the crossings , @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ thermodynamics _ @xmath2 the system average particle number , internal energy and shannon entropy just before the crossing with the reservoir level @xmath11 is given , respectively , by @xmath54 across the avoided crossing @xmath11 , the system occupation may change and induce as a result a change in particle number , entropy , as well as energy in the form of heat . in between the crossing with @xmath11 and @xmath13 , </S>",
    "<S> the occupation remains unchanged and as a result the particle number and the entropy do not change . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the level is filled , the energy will change under the form of mechanical work ( due to changes in the energy level ) by an amount @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the average work , @xmath56 , done on the system in going from @xmath11 to @xmath13 ( denoted @xmath57 in short ) thus consists of the mechanical work @xmath58 generated by the driving and the chemical work @xmath59 needed to transfer particles from the reservoir to the system . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding average heat entering the system is @xmath60 . in accordance with the first and second law of thermodynamics </S>",
    "<S> , the energy and entropy change can be written as @xmath61 using the _ local detailed balance _ property of lz rates , @xmath62 , the entropy production can be shown to be nonnegative and reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 + ( 1-p)\\ln[(1-p)/(1-p ' ) ] \\geq 0 $ ] denotes the relative entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed calculations for a general stochastic thermodynamics in discrete time are given in the supplementary materials . </S>",
    "<S> combining the first and second law , the entropy production can also be rewritten as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the change in nonequilibrium grand potential @xmath67 . introducing the dissipated mechanical work @xmath68 with the equilibrium grand potential @xmath69 , and realizing that @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that entropy production can now be expressed as @xmath71 the second ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> third ) term on the rhs measures the distance from equilibrium right before crossing @xmath13 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the thermodynamics of the _ qm - adiabatic regime_. if just before the crossing the system has been prepared in an arbitrary occupation @xmath47 , using ( [ epmodel ] ) and ( [ dissw ] ) , we find that the dissipation occurring at the crossing is @xmath72 and the dissipative work done on the system to lift the level from @xmath11 to @xmath13 is @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> if the system is initially prepared at equilibrium , @xmath74 and the first crossing is perfectly reversible @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the instantaneous thermalization of the level implies that the subsequent crossings ( @xmath16 ) will be such that @xmath76 and @xmath49 and an amount @xmath77 will be dissipated at every crossing . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that in general qm - adiabaticity does not imply thermodynamic reversibility . </S>",
    "<S> this however becomes true in the limit @xmath78 where the inequality @xmath43 is maintained . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in this case @xmath79 as well as @xmath80 both tend to zero proportionally to order @xmath81 while heat and entropy change become equal , to order @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the thermodynamics of the _ qm - diabatic regime_. in this case , the level rises without changes in its initial occupation probability @xmath83 . as a result </S>",

    "<S> thanks to the local detailed balance property of the rates , the work fluctuation theorem can be derived following a procedure almost identical to that detailed in refs . </S>",

    "<S> [ workpdf.fig ] , these two distributions obtained using our stochastic model are shown to be in excellent agreement with those obtained using the numerically exact quantum dynamics in the total system with hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) . in this latter case </S>",

    "<S> note that their explicit dependence on the driving speed @xmath12 has disappeared . </S>",
