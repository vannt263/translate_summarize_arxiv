    "@xcite ) .",
    "generally , in the case of the central exclusive production @xmath80 with the leading protons , the central system @xmath81 should necessarily be produced in the color singlet state , such that the proton remnants and the @xmath81 system are disconnected in the color space and their hadronisation occurs independently giving rise to rapidity gaps @xcite . from the experimental point of view , cep procesess are very attractive , because of the rare clean experimental environment , related to @xmath82 selection rule , and great mass resolution of the centraly produced object .",

    "<S> we show that the present knowledge of gluon distributions does not allow to make a precise predictions for @xmath0 production at lhc , in particular at forward rapidities . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> we use mrst - qed parton distributions which include photon as a parton in the proton as well as elastic photon distributions calculated in the equivalent photon approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we present distributions in the @xmath6 quark ( @xmath7 antiquark ) rapidity and transverse momenta and compare them to the dominant gluon - gluon fusion contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss also inclusive single and central diffractive processes using diffractive parton distribution found from the analysis of hera diffractive data . as in the previous case we present distribution in @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) rapidity and transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> finally we present results for exclusive central diffractive mechanism discussed recently in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we show corresponding differential distributions and compare them with corresponding distributions for single and central diffractive components . </S>"
