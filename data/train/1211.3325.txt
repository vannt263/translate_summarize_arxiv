    "<S> this calculation implies a connection between the field - dependent quasiparticle recombination and the field - induced pair breaking . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4]d are intriguing , bringing out the question of how the photoexcited quasiparticles relax in a gapless superconductor , motivating challenging experiments to probe the gapless regime .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our time - resolved pump - probe measurements on metallic _ s_-wave superconductors reveal a slowing of quasiparticle recombination in an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the field was aligned parallel to the thin - film sample surface , to minimize effects due to vortices . </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible causes of the observed slowing : field - induced spin imbalance and field - induced gap reduction . </S>",
    "<S> the spin imbalance is unlikely to be important in nb@xmath1ti@xmath1n and nbn due to strong spin - orbit scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario can be tested by investigating materials with small spin - orbit scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the field - induced gap reduction alone can explain quantitatively the slowing of recombination , and we conclude it to be the dominant effect observed in our experiment .    we thank p. bosland and e. jacques for providing the samples , j. j. tu for access to the magnet , r. p. s. m. lobo for data acquisition software development , g. nintzel and r. smith for technical assistance , and p. j. hirschfeld for discussions . </S>",
