    "[ sect : discussion ] .",
    "rotation has particular roles in the evolution massive stars as it changes the stellar structure , induces chemical mixing and enhances mass loss due to stellar winds @xcite . during the last decade ,",
    "several authors have calculated massive star models up to the pre - supernova stage , considering the redistribution of angular momentum and chemical species due to rotationally induced hydrodynamic instabilities , such as eddington - sweet circulations , and the shear instability @xcite .",
    "although these models could explain some observational aspects such as surface abundances of cno elements of massive stars and wolf - rayet ( wr ) star populations at different metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their adopted angular momentum transport mechanisms turned out to be too inefficient to explain the observed spin rates of stellar remnants @xcite .",
    "i.e. , their models predict nearly two orders of magnitude higher spin rates of white dwarfs and young neutron stars than the observed ones . these models also imply that almost all wr stars can retain enough angular momentum to produce grbs , either by magnetar or collapsar formation depending on the final mass .",
    "this gives a nearly 1000 times higher ratio of grbs to sne than the observationally implied value . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite suggested that magnetic torques resulting from dynamo actions in differentially rotating radiative layers ( the so - called spruit - tayler dynamo ) should be the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism compared to the pure hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "recent magnetic models that adopt the spruit - tayler dynamo according to the prescription by @xcite are indeed more consistent with observations in terms of the spin rates of stellar remnants @xcite .",
    "magnetic models also better explain the fact that long grbs are rare events compared to normal core collapse supernovae .",
    "although the spruit - tayler dynamo mechanism is still subject to many uncertainties @xcite , these recent studies indicate that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism comparable to what the spruit - tayler dynamo predicts is needed to understand the observations .    the above discussion is based on single star models , and the role of rotation in the evolution of massive binary stars remained relatively unexplored .",
    "massive stars in close binary systems are supposed to experience an exchange of mass and angular momentum via mass transfer and tidal interaction , and thus the evolution of binary stars is more complex than that of single stars . @xcite and @xcite presented , for the first time , self - consistent calculations of massive binary star evolution models including many relevant effects of rotation and binary interactions : the change of the stellar structure due to the centrifugal force , transport of angular momentum and chemical species due to rotationally induced hydrodynamic instabilities , tidal interaction , transfer of mass from the primary , accretion of mass and angular momentum of the secondary , and resulting changes of the orbit .",
    "their work indicates that the secondary can be easily spun up by mass accretion even up to critical rotation , thus modulating the mass accretion efficiency by the interplay of the enhanced mass loss due to rotation from the spun - up secondary and the mass transfer from the primary .",
    "this effect provides important clues to better understand the evolutionary paths of some observed x - ray and wr star binary systems as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their non - magnetic models also show that massive stars may end up with different core spin rates depending on the history of mass loss / gain during binary evolution , that could be related to the observational diversity of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite included the spruit - tayler dynamo in their binary models , and discussed possible evolutionary paths of massive binary stars towards long grbs . in this paper , we present new evolutionary calculations of magnetic ( i.e. , the spruit - tayler dynamo is included ) massive binary stars for a large parameter space , focusing on the evolution of the primary stars to investigate the nature of typical sne ibc progenitors .      wlw95 employed the mass - dependent mass loss rate of wr stars of @xcite for their helium star models , and wl99 used those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both studies concluded that the final masses of sne ibc progenitors in binary systems should converge to a limited range of 2.2  3.6  @xmath0 , even for an initial helium star mass of 20  @xmath0 .",
    "later developments of the wr wind theory considering clumpies pointed out , however , that the wr mass loss rates used by wlw95 and wl99 are significantly overestimated @xcite . for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : wrwind ] shows that , for helium stars on the zero age main sequence , the mass loss rate given by @xcite is almost an order - of - magnitude lower than that of hamann et al .",

    "interestingly the total angular momentum of the primary star gradually increases from the initial synchronization until the onset of case a mass transfer ( fig .",

    "[ fig : jcoreseq10 ] , a rather rapid decrease of @xmath62 occurs during and after the case a mass transfer , which is a combined effect of mass loss and magnetic torques : mass loss carries away angular momentum from the envelope , and magnetic torques brake the core rotation subsequently .",

    "17 ) is not much different from that of seq .",

    "this ratio continuously decreases as the star evolves , and thus @xmath30 continuously increases to such an extent that the effect of synchronization can be ignored when case a mass transfer starts .",
    "when @xmath65 with tassoul s prescription is used ( seq .",
    "16 ) , on the other hand , synchronization becomes important even after the case ab mass transfer phase , and the primary is further spun down by tidal interaction , giving @xmath66 at the neon burning phase .      in seq .",
    "18 where the spruit - tayler dynamo is not included , the core is spun down due to synchronization during the case a mass transfer phase ( fig .",

    "[ fig : jcoreseq9 ] ) .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling becomes significantly weakened as the orbit widens after the case a mass transfer phase . despite a significant amount of mass is lost via case ab mass transfer , the core in the primary star retains most of the remaining angular momentum in the following evolutionary stages .",
    "this is because the chemical gradient across the boundary between the helium core and the hydrogen envelope effectively prohibits the transport of angular momentum ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the core angular momentum at neon burning is thus about 10 times larger ( @xmath67 ) than in the corresponding magnetic case .      as shown in the above examples , in the model sequences with the spruit - tayler dynamo , all of the primary stars retain similar amounts of angular momentum ( a few @xmath68 ) in the innermost @xmath58 at neon burning regardless of the detailed history of mass transfer , unless synchronization is extremely fast as in seq .",
    "16 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "according to the spruit - tayler dynamo , magnetic torques exerted to the core become stronger with a higher spin rate , a larger degree of differential rotation between the core and the envelope , and a heavier radiative envelope .",
    "therefore , although winds or roche - lobe overflows reduce the size of the hydrogen envelope and remove angular momentum from the star , this in turn weakens the torque exerted to the core , and vice versa .",
    "the remarkable convergence of @xmath69 to a few @xmath68 in our model sequences , even for different wind parameters and metallicities as shown in table  [ tab1 ] , can be explained by this self - regulating nature of the spruit - tayler dynamo .",
    "this result indicates that not much diversity is expected in sne ibc progenitors produced via case  a or case ab / b mass transfer , in terms of rotation : most of sne ibc of a similar progenitor mass may leave neutron stars with a similar spin rate .",
    "however , other types of binary interactions still may lead to various final rotation periods in sn progenitors ( see * ? ? ?",

    "in the literature , the detailed history of binary interactions such as mass transfer and tidal interaction is often neglected , and only the evolution of pure helium stars to discuss sne ibc progenitors in binary systems is investigated ( e.g. wlw95 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although this approach is very useful , our binary star models indicate that complications resulting from binary interactions have important consequences in sn ibc progenitors . to address this issue , here we also present evolutionary models of non - rotating single helium stars with initial masses of 2.8  20  @xmath0 at @xmath70 for comparison with binary star models , as presented in table  [ tab2 ] .",

    "however , for a less massive helium star , the expansion of the helium envelope becomes so dramatic during co core contraction , and/or during core carbon burning , that it can lead to another mass transfer phase : case abb or case bb ( e.g. , compare the final radius of the 2.8 @xmath0 helium star model with those of more massive helium star models in table  [ tab2 ] ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the evolution of type ib / c supernova ( sn ib / c ) progenitors in close binary systems , using new evolutionary models that include the effects of rotation , with initial masses of 12  25  @xmath0 for the primary components , and of single helium stars with initial masses of 2.8  20  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , despite the impact of tidal interaction on the rotation of primary stars , the amount of angular momentum retained in the core at the presupernova stage in different binary model sequences converge to a value similar to those found in previous single star models . </S>",
    "<S> this amount is large enough to produce millisecond pulsars , but too small to produce magnetars or long gamma - ray bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the most up - to - date estimate for the wolf - rayet mass loss rate , and its implications for sn ib / c progenitors are discussed in detail . in terms of stellar structure , sn ib / c progenitors in binary systems at solar metallicity are predicted to have a wide range of final masses up to about 7  @xmath0 , with helium envelopes of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that , if the lack of helium lines in the spectra of sne ic were due to small amounts of helium ( e.g. @xmath2 ) , the distribution of both initial and final masses of sn ic progenitors should be bimodal . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that a thin hydrogen layer ( @xmath3 ) is expected to be present in many sn ib progenitors at the presupernova stage . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the presence of hydrogen , together with a rather thick helium envelope , can lead to a significant expansion of some sn ib / c progenitors by the time of supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> this may have important consequences for the shock break - out and supernova light curve . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that some sn progenitors with thin hydrogen layers produced via case ab / b transfer might be related to type iib supernova progenitors with relatively small radii of about @xmath4 . </S>"
