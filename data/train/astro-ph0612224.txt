    "for the same reason that eclipsing binary stars are important in stellar astrophysics , transiting planets play an outsized role in exoplanetary science . this can be appreciated by comparing the transiting exoplanet hd  189733b ( bouchy et al .",
    "2005 ) , the subject of this paper , to the arbitrarily chosen non - transiting planet hd  187123b ( butler et al .",
    "both planets are `` hot jupiters '' detected by the doppler method .",
    "all that is known about hd  187123b is its orbital period ( @xmath0  days ) and minimum mass ( @xmath1  @xmath2 ) , despite 6  years having elapsed since its discovery .",
    "in contrast , for hd  189733b , discovered only 1.5  yr ago , transit photometry has revealed the planet s radius ( @xmath3  @xmath4 ; bouchy et al .",
    "2005 , bakos et al .",
    "2006a ) and removed the @xmath5 ambiguity in the planet s mass ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) .",
    "infrared photometry during a secondary eclipse has led to a determination of the planet s 16  @xmath8 m brightness temperature ( @xmath9 ; deming et al .",
    "most recently , spectroscopic observations during a transit have shown that the angle on the sky between the orbit normal and the stellar rotation axis is within a few degrees of zero ( winn et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "these measurements are essential for a complete understanding of the atmospheres and interiors of hot jupiters , as well as their formation and migration mechanisms .",
    "an even richer set of measurements can be expected in the future , from investigators pursuing transmission spectroscopy , reflected - light observations , and other transit - related investigations ( as reviewed recently by charbonneau et al .",
    "one goal of the transit light curve ( tlc ) project is to support these efforts by refining the estimates of the planetary , stellar , and orbital parameters , through high - accuracy , high - cadence photometry of exoplanetary transits .",
    "we also seek to measure or bound any variations in the transit times and light - curve shapes that would be caused by the influence of additional bodies in the system ( miralda - escud 2002 ; agol et al .",
    "2005 ; holman & murray 2005 ) . along the way",
    ", we are exploring different techniques for photometry and parameter determination .",
    "previous papers in this series have reported results for the exoplanets xo-1b ( holman et al .",
    "2006a ) , ogle - tr-111b ( winn et al .  2007 ) , tres-1 ( winn , holman , & roussanova 2006 ) , and ogle - tr-10b ( holman et al .",

    "this paper presents our results for hd  189733b , along with out - of - transit photometry spanning two years .",
    "the reason for gathering out - of - transit photometry was to attempt to measure the stellar rotation period .",
    "the parent star is relatively active , with a chromospheric activity index @xmath10 ( wright et al .",
    "2004 ) and @xmath11 , raising the possibility of measuring the rotation period through starspot - induced quasiperiodic flux variations .",
    "as we will explain , the measurements of both the rotation period and the rossiter - mclaughlin effect permit the determination of the true angle between the orbit normal and stellar rotation axis ( as opposed to the angle between the projections of those vectors on the sky , which was measured by winn et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   2 , we present photometry of 8 different transits , along with nightly photometry over two consecutive observing seasons .",
    "in particular ,   2.2 presents the out - of - transit photometry and the estimation of the stellar rotation period . in   3 , we describe the parameteric model that was fitted to the data , and in   4 we present the results for the planetary , stellar , and orbital parameters , as well as the new transit ephemerides , a limit on the orbital eccentricity , and the three - dimensional spin - orbit alignment .",
    "the last section is a summary .",
    "our observations took place in 2005 and 2006 using telescopes at 4 different observatories .",
    "each of the sections below presents the photometry from a given observatory . all together , we observed 8 different transits .",
    "table  1 gives a summary of the characteristics of the data from each transit , and table  2 gives the final photometry .",
    "a telescope at fairborn observatory (   2.2 ) was also used to monitor the out - of - transit flux of hd  189733 over the two observing seasons .",
    "we observed the transits of ut  2006  jul  21 and sep  10 with the 1.2 m telescope at the fred l.  whipple observatory on mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona .",
    "we used keplercam , which has one 4096@xmath12 fairchild 486 back - illuminated ccd , with a @xmath13 field of view . for our observations we used @xmath14 binning , which gives a scale of @xmath15 per binned pixel , a readout and setup time of 11  s , and a typical readout noise of 7 e@xmath16 per binned pixel .",
    "we observed both transits through the sdss @xmath17  band filter , in order to minimize the effect of color - dependent atmospheric extinction on the relative photometry and to minimize the effect of limb - darkening on the transit light curve .",
    "we deliberately defocused the telescope such that the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of stellar images was about 7  binned pixels ( @xmath18 ) in order to permit a consistent exposure time of 5  s. we used automatic guiding to keep the image registration as constant as possible .",
    "we also obtained dome flat exposures and zero - second ( bias ) exposures at the beginning and the end of each night .",
    "on ut  2006  jul  21 , the sky conditions began partly cloudy but gradually improved as the night went on .",
    "we observed the target star as it rose from an airmass of 1.19 to 1.01 and then descended to an airmass of 1.23 .",
    "there was a 15-minute interruption after second contact , due to clouds .",
    "on ut  2006  sep  10 , the sky conditions were mainly clear ( but not all - sky photometric ) .",
    "we followed the target star from an airmass of 1.02 to 2.5 , although we discarded the data taken at airmass  @xmath19 because of their much poorer quality .",
    "there was a 15-minute interruption prior to third contact , due to a computer crash , which also caused a change in image registration and focus .",
    "we used standard iraf procedures for the overscan correction , trimming , bias subtraction , and flat - field division .",
    "we performed aperture photometry of hd  189733 and 14 nearby and necessarily fainter stars .",
    "the light curve of each comparison star was normalized to have unit median , and the mean of these normalized light curves was taken to be the comparison signal .",
    "the light curve of hd  189733 was divided by the comparison signal , and corrected for residual systematic effects by dividing out a linear function of time .",
    "the zero point and slope of the linear function were determined as part of the model - fitting procedure , as explained in   4 .",
    "figure  1 shows the final light curves , along with a time - averaged composite light curve created from the two data sets .    0.2 in      we used the t10 0.8 m automated photometric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory , in arizona , to observe four complete transits of hd  189733b and to monitor the out - of - transit stellar flux .",
    "the t10 apt is equipped with a two - channel precision photometer employing two emi 9124qb bi - alkali photomultiplier tubes to make simultaneous measurements in the strmgren @xmath20 and @xmath21 passbands .",
    "the apt measures the difference in brightness between a program star and a nearby constant comparison star ( or stars ) with a typical precision of 0.0015  mag for bright stars ( @xmath22 ) . for the hd  189733 transits",
    ", we used the comparison star hd  189410 ( @xmath23 = 5.68 , @xmath24 = 0.34 , f0 ) .",
    "the differential magnitudes were reduced with nightly extinction coefficients and transformed to the strmgren system with yearly mean transformation coefficients . to improve our photometric precision , we combined the separate @xmath20 and @xmath21 differential magnitudes into a single @xmath25 passband . for additional information on the telescopes , photometers , observing procedures , and data reduction techniques ,",
    "see henry  ( 1999 ) and eaton , henry , & fekel ( 2003 ) .",
    "we observed the transits of ut  2005  nov  28 , 2006  may  2 , 2006  may  22 , and 2006  jun  11 . on each of those nights",
    ", the differential magnitude of hd  189733 was recorded for 3 - 5 hours bracketing the expected time of mid - transit .",
    "the transit light curves are shown in the top 4 panels of fig .",
    "2 . like the flwo data",
    ", these data have been corrected by a linear function of time that was determined as part of the fitting procedure ( see   4 ) .",
    "in addition , we also measured the out - of - transit flux with the apt on 93 different nights spanning two observing seasons between 2005  october and 2006  july .",
    "three comparison stars were observed on each night .",
    "the out - of - transit flux measurements are shown in the top two panels of fig .",
    "the flux varied erratically during the 2005 observing season and at the beginning of the 2006 season . however , a quasiperiodic signal became evident near the end of our 2006 season observations with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 1.3% and a period of about 13  days , although only 2.5  cycles were observed .    this type of photometric behavior ",
    "erratic and occasionally quasiperiodic variation  is common among chromospherically active stars , especially stars with low or intermediate levels of activity ( see , e.g. , henry , fekel , & hall 1995 ) .",
    "the photometric variability in these stars arises from photospheric starspots and plages that are carried into and out of view by the stellar rotation . in the case of hd  189733 ,",
    "the spots cover only @xmath261% of the stellar surface at any moment , and their distribution on the star changes significantly on the rotational timescale .",
    "a periodogram of the quasiperiodic portion of the light curve ( indicated by the solid dots in the middle panel of fig .",
    "3 ) shows a strong peak at 13.4  days , which we take to be the stellar rotation period .",
    "we estimated the uncertainty by recalculating the light curve using each of the three different comparison stars ; the standard deviation of the results was 0.4  days .",
    "thus , in what follows , we adopt the value @xmath27  days .",
    "since this result is only based on 2.5  cycles , continued observations are warranted to check our estimate",
    ". there may be additional errors because of differential rotation and the variations in spot positions and intensities on the rotational timescale .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 shows the flux as a function of rotational phase during the epoch of quasiperiodic variation .",
    "a periodogram of the entire data set also shows a peak at 13.4  days , along with a peak at 6.7  days , presumably from a time period when star spots occurred on both sides of the star .",
    "we observed the transit of ut  2006  aug  21 with the 2 m telescope at the multi - color active galactic nuclei monitoring ( magnum ) observatory on haleakala , hawaii ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1998 ; yoshii 2002 ; yoshii , kobayashi , & minezaki 2003 ) .",
    "this is the same transit that was observed spectroscopically by winn et al .",
    "we used the multi - color imaging photometer ( mip ) , which allows for simultaneous observation with an optical 1024@xmath12 site ccd and an infrared sbrc insb 256@xmath12 detector . in this case , we used only the optical detector , because the infrared detector was saturated even in very short exposures .",
    "we observed in the @xmath23 band . because the mip field of view is only @xmath28 , and there are no good comparison stars within this small field , we nodded repeatedly between the target star and a calibration star , with 1  s exposures .",
    "the calibration star was hd  190449 ( @xmath23 = 8.12 , @xmath24 = 0.79 , k0 ) .",
    "the average interval between exposures of hd  189733 was 46  s. the median fwhm of stellar images was @xmath29 .",
    "we reduced the images with the standard mip pipeline described by minezaki et al .",
    "we then performed aperture photometry on hd  189733 and hd  190449 , using an aperture radius of @xmath30 and a sky annulus ranging in radius from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . to produce a comparison signal ,",
    "the time series for hd  190449 was boxcar - smoothed ( with a width of 4 points , or 3  minutes ) and then linearly interpolated onto the time stamps of the hd  189733 data .",
    "then the hd  189733 time series was divided by this comparison signal .",
    "a few extreme outlying points were rejected . to remove residual systematic errors in the out - of - transit flux determination ,",
    "we divided by a linear function of time that was determined as part of the fitting procedure ( see   4 ) .",
    "the final light curve is shown in the fifth panel of fig .  2 .",
    "we observed the transit of 2006  sep  5 with the 1 m telescope at wise observatory , in israel .",
    "we used a tektronix 1024@xmath12 back - illuminated ccd detector , giving a pixel scale of @xmath32 and a field of view of @xmath33 .",
    "we observed through a johnson @xmath34 filter , the reddest optical band available on this camera .",
    "the exposure time was 10  s and the telescope was defocused in order to avoid saturation .",
    "autoguiding was used to keep the image registration constant throughout the night .",
    "we also obtained sky flat exposures at sunset and zero - second ( bias ) exposures at the beginning and during the night .",
    "we performed the data reduction and photometry using very similar procedures to those that were used on the flwo data (   2.1 ) .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .  2 shows the final light curve .",
    "to estimate the planetary , stellar , and orbital parameters , and the times of transit , we fitted a parameterized model to the transit photometry . the model and",
    "the fitting method were similar to those described in previous tlc papers ( see , e.g. , winn et al .",
    "2007 ) , except that in this case we accounted for correlated noise , as described below .",
    "the model is based on a keplerian orbit of a star ( with mass @xmath35 and radius @xmath36 ) and a single planet ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) about their center of mass . for most of the analysis we assumed that the orbital eccentricity @xmath39 is zero , because the expected timescale of tidal circularization is short in the absence of excitations from other planets ( see , e.g. , rasio et al .",
    "1996 , trilling et al .",
    "2000 , dobbs - dixon et al .",
    "2004 , adams & laughlin 2006 ) .",
    "however , in   4.3 , we discuss the empirical upper limits on the orbital eccentricity .",
    "the orbit has a period @xmath40 and an inclination @xmath41 relative to the sky plane .",
    "we define the coordinate system such that @xmath42 .",
    "it is often useful to refer to the impact parameter @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the semimajor axis ) rather than the inclination .    because one of our goals was to measure the individual transit times , we allowed each transit to have an independent value of @xmath45 , the transit midpoint , rather than forcing them to be separated by exact multiples of the orbital period . thus , the only effect of @xmath40 on the model is to determine the semimajor axis @xmath44 for a given value of the total mass .",
    "we fixed @xmath46  days , the value determined by bouchy et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and hbrard & lecavelier des etangs  ( 2006 ) from the detection of transits in the _ hipparcos _ database .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath47  days was negligible for our purposes , although we were able to use the resulting values of @xmath45 to produce an independent estimate of the period , as described in   5 .",
    "neither @xmath35 nor @xmath37 can be determined from photometry alone . as we have done in previous tlc analyses",
    ", we fixed @xmath35 at a value that is based on an analysis of the stellar spectrum and other observable properties .",
    "we then used the scaling relations @xmath48 and @xmath49 to estimate the systematic error associated with the uncertainty in @xmath35 . in this case",
    "we adopted the value @xmath50",
    "@xmath51 ( bouchy et al .  2005 ) .",
    "the planetary mass @xmath37 hardly affects the photometric model at all , but for completeness we used the value @xmath52",
    "@xmath7 ( winn et al .  2006 ) .    to calculate the relative flux as a function of the projected separation of the planet and the star",
    ", we employed the analytic formulas of mandel & agol  ( 2002 ) to compute the integral of the intensity over the unobscured portion of the stellar disk .",
    "we assumed the limb darkening law to be quadratic , @xmath53 where @xmath34 is the intensity , and @xmath8 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the stellar surface .",

    "we also investigated the effect of fitting for the limb darkening parameters , as discussed below .",
    "in addition , the light curves exhibited gradients in the out - of - transit data , probably due to differential extinction between the target star and the comparison stars , or some other systematic error .",
    "for this reason , each of the 8 data sets was modeled with two extra parameters : the out - of - transit flux @xmath60 and a time gradient @xmath61 .",

    "of particular importance is the timescale of the systematic effects .",
    "correlated noise effectively reduces the number of independent data points and correspondingly increases the uncertainties in the model parameters , an issue that pont et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and gillon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have recently brought to attention in the context of transit photometry .",
    "our approach to this problem was as follows .",
    "first , for each of the 8 transits , we rescaled the instrumental uncertainties such that @xmath66 for the best - fitting model .",
    "the resulting uncertainties are those that are given in table  2 .",
    "second , we followed the procedure of gillion et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to decompose the observed noise into `` white noise '' ( that which averages down as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the number of data points ) and `` red noise '' ( that which does not average down over some specified time interval ) . specifically , we calculated the standard deviation of the residuals ( @xmath69 ) and the standard deviation of the time - averaged residuals ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the averaging time was 1  hr ( a timescale comparable to the transit event ) , corresponding to a number @xmath68 of data points that depended upon the cadence of observations .",
    "then we solved for the white noise @xmath71 and red noise @xmath72 from the system of equations @xmath73 finally , to account approximately for the effective reduction in the number of independent data points , we rescaled the @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) by the factor @xmath74 .",
    "the results for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and the rescaling factor for each data set are given in table 1 .",
    "these results are not very sensitive to the choice of averaging time .",
    "any choice between 15  min and a few hours gave similar results . among the data sets are wide disparities in the degree of red noise , ranging over a factor of 10 . by far the best data , in the sense of the smallest noise correlations , are from the flwo 1.2 m telescope and keplercam (   2.1 ) .",
    "for this reason , we decided to estimate the system parameters using _ only _ the flwo data , and use the other data sets only to determine transit times and as a consistency check on the flwo results .",
    "( had we included the other data sets , their statistical weight would anyways have been much smaller . )    in short , we used the flwo data to solve for the two bodies radii ( @xmath36 and @xmath38 ) ; the orbital inclination ( @xmath41 ) ; and the mid - transit time ( @xmath45 ) , the out - of - transit flux ( @xmath60 ) , and a time gradient ( @xmath61 ) for each of the 2 transits .",
    "we then fixed @xmath36 , @xmath38 , and @xmath41 at the best - fitting values , and fitted each of the remaining 6 data sets to find @xmath45 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .    to solve for the model parameters and their uncertainties",
    ", we used a markov chain monte carlo algorithm ( see , e.g. , tegmark 2004 ) .",
    "our jump function was the addition of a gaussian random number to each parameter value .",
    "we set the perturbation sizes such that @xmath2620% of jumps are executed .",
    "we created 10 independent chains , each with 500,000 points , starting from random initial positions , and discarded the first 20% of the points in each chain .",

    "we allowed both @xmath39 and @xmath131 to be free parameters , but with an a priori constraint on @xmath137 to enforce compliance with the secondary - eclipse measurement .",
    "the result for @xmath136 was @xmath138 .",
    "hence , both components of the eccentricity vector are consistent with zero , and @xmath137 is about 20 times more tightly bounded than @xmath136 .",
    "values of @xmath39 as large as @xmath1070.02 are allowed , but only for @xmath131 very close to @xmath139 .",
    "thanks to the apt data (   2.2 ) ,",
    "hd  189733 is the first star with a measured rotation period that also has a transiting planet .",
    "together with the transit photometry and the observation of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , this allows for the determination of the angle between the stellar rotation axis and the planetary orbit normal , as anticipated by queloz et al .",
    "this angle is worth measuring because any significant misalignment may be an indication of perturbative effects during planetary migration , among other reasons ( as explained in more detail by ohta et al .",
    "2005 , winn et al .  2005 and gaudi & winn 2007 ) .",
    "the true ( three - dimensional ) angle @xmath140 between the stellar spin axis and the orbital axis is given by the formula @xmath141 where @xmath41 is the orbital inclination , @xmath142 is the inclination of the stellar rotation axis , and @xmath143 is the angle between the sky projections of the two axes .",

    "(   2.2 ) , but the current uncertainty in @xmath140 is dominated by the error in @xmath144 which is itself dominated by systematic errors arising from the interpretation of the transit spectra ( see winn et al .",
    "specifically , the systematic error arose from the `` calibration '' the rossiter - mclaughlin effect using simulated spectra , which was needed because the transit spectra were observed through an i@xmath157 cell and analyzed with an algorithm that is nominally designed for measuring doppler shifts rather than spectral distortions .",
    "further improvement might be achieved through a more sophisticated set of simulations or perhaps by re - observing the rossiter - mclaughlin effect without the i@xmath157 cell ( i.e. , using a different technique to account for instrumental variations ) .",
    "we have presented photometry of 8 complete transits of the exoplanet hd  189733b , and modeled the light curves in order to determine the radii of the star and the planet .",
    "our results are consistent with previous results and with theoretical expectations for close - in jovian planets .",
    "stringent limits on the orbital eccentricity follow from the measured transit times , in conjunction with a previous detection of the secondary eclipse and with the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "we have also presented nightly out - of - transit photometry spanning 2  yr that has revealed the stellar rotation period .",
    "we have used this information , along with a previous analysis of the spectroscopic transit , to place an upper bound on the true angle between the stellar rotation axis and the orbital axis . with these developments ,",
