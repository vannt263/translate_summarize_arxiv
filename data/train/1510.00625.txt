    "there exist several counter intuitive phenomena in quantum theory without parallel in classical mechanics , going beyond mere theoretical curiosity to the realm of useful practical applications . different types of entanglement have been used as resources in tasks such as secure key generation  @xcite , random number generation  @xcite , and distinguishing between quantum channels  @xcite .",
    "bell - nonlocality and einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering are two types of quantum correlations that may be present in spatially correlated entangled systems .",
    "violation of bell - chsh inequalities  @xcite prohibits the local hidden variable description of correlations in measurement outcomes corresponding to the two entangled parties .",
    "steering , originally introduced by schrodinger  @xcite in response to the epr paradox  @xcite , is the ability of one party , alice , to affect the state of another remote party , bob , through her choice of measurements .",
    "such an ability depends on the entanglement of the pair shared between alice and bob , as well as the measurement settings chosen for each particles of the pair .",
    "the concepts of bell - nonlocality and epr steering have both been reformulated in terms of information theoretic tasks  @xcite leading to characterization of entanglement between two parties under various levels of trust assigned to the measurement devices possessed by them .",
    "such a characterization has applications in the secret key generation protocols , _",
    "i.e. , _ security through violation of bell - inequality in device independent quantum key distribution(qkd )  @xcite , and through steering in one - sided device - independent qkd  @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy of spatial correlations in quantum mechanics is thereby revealed , _",
    "i.e. _ , the set of all states violating bell - chsh inequalities form a strict subset of the the set of all states that are steerable , which in turn themselves form a strict subset of the set of all entangled states  @xcite .",
    "the subject of temporal correlations in quantum mechanics has attracted increased attention in recent years .",
    "temporal correlations refer to the correlations in the outcomes of measurements performed on the same particle acquired through two or more successive measurements , as distinct from spatial correlations which pertain to correlations in outcomes of measurements performed on two or more spatially separated particles . following the seminal work of leggett and garg  @xcite ,",
    "various studies have been performed leading to the formulation of macrorealistic inequalities for temporally correlated systems .",
    "the leggett - garg inequalities ( lgi ) have been generalized for different physical systems  @xcite . a bound for temporal correlation has been derived  @xcite by considering a general scenario whose",
    "special cases arise in the context of macrorealism and noncontextuality .",
    "the issue of how classicality may emerge for temporally correlated systems have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "it has been further shown  @xcite that necessary and sufficient conditions for macro - realism emerge when no signalling in time ( nsit ) is satisfied for all combinations of sequential measurements .",
    "several experimental results on violations of lgi have been reported@xcite , signifying the untenability of macrorealistic principles at the quantum level , parallel to the refutation of local realism through experimental violations of bell - chsh inequalities . on the other hand ,",
    "the notion of steering has been extended recently in the domain of temporal correlations through the formulation of single system steering where measurements on a single system are considered at different times  @xcite .",
    "the obtained temporal steering inequality is related to the security bound of the bennett - brassard 1984  @xcite protocol of qkd .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the temporal steering inequality is formally mathematically equivalent to an inequality for spatial steering .",
    "quantum invasiveness of measurement is ingrained in the above two different formulations of temporal correlations probed through the lgi and the temporal steering inequality .",
    "there are three alternative conditions for probing the violation of macrorealism for temporal correlations , _ viz .",
    "_ , through the violation of lgi , nsit , or wlgi ( wigner type lgi ) .",
    "a comparative study of these alternative conditions has been done in ref .",
    "temporal steering on the other hand , is probed through the violation of a weaker notion of the non - existence of a hidden state model ( hsm ) for the post - measurement state . though a hidden variable model ( hvm ) trivially follows from any hsm , it is nontrivial to show how these different notions of temporal correlations differ in real testable situations .",
    "there exists no study in the literature along these lines .",
    "therefore , a natural question arises here as to what , if any , is the relation between these two apparently different ways of probing quantum invasiveness .",
    "the motivation for the present work is to probe the similarities and differences pertaining to temporal correlations formulated in the above two ways . to this end in the present work",
    "we first describe our protocol of temporal steering and derive a temporal analogue of the chsh type steering inequality  @xcite .",
    "we then show that steerable and lgi violating correlations are equivalent in the context of unitary time evolution and projective measurements .",
    "the degeneracy between the two types of temporal correlations pertaining to the violation of lgi on the one hand , and single system steering on the other , is thus evident at the level of unitary evolution and standard projective measurements . in order to break this degeneracy",
    ", we next consider more general measurements .",
    "the hierarchy between the two different kinds of temporal correlations may be revealed by employing generalised quantum measurement dubbed as positive operator valued measurements ( povm ) , as we conjecture through the help of a relevant example .",
    "the dissimilarity with the case of spatial correlation is apparent since a only projective measurement is sufficient for differentiating bell nonlocality and spatial steerability .",
    "we finally consider the case of non - unitary evolution with projective measurements , which demonstrates that the lgi violating correlations are stronger than those that allow temporal steering .",
    "we begin by describing the scenario of temporal correlations of a single system undergoing time evolution .",
    "temporal correlations have been considered in a general form in ref  .@xcite irrespective of the type of evolution or compatibility of the observables sequentially measured .",
    "measurement of commutative observables invokes a scenario of quantum contextuality test , whereas noncommutative observables correspond to a test of macrorealism . here",
    "we consider different possible types of temporal correlation analogously to the case of different spatial correlations .",
    "_ protocol of single system steering : _ sequential measurements on a single system is usually done by a single observer at different times",
    ". it can also be thought as if there are two observers , say , alice and bob measuring on a single system sequentially . in our steering protocol in a single run alice measures on the system first according to bob s request , and then sends it to him via some quantum channel , announcing her result publicly .",
    "finally , bob measures on the system in his possession .",
    "a system evolves from an initial state @xmath0 to some state @xmath1 at time @xmath2 under some quantum channel . after performing a general measurement ( povm ) on the system as asked by bob",

    "the set of povms satisfies @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the probability of getting @xmath5 is given by @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "bob needs to verify whether alice gave him a post - measured assemblage @xmath13 or not . if bob finds after state tomography that the assemblage @xmath3 has come from a fixed ensemble @xmath14 , called hidden state ensemble ( hse ) , ( where @xmath15 is the distribution of states @xmath16 ) , he is not convinced about alice s steerability . in this case",
    "alice can adopt a classical strategy ( cheating strategy ) to prepare the state for bob , which can be written in terms of hse as @xmath17 this means alice has send bob states by picking from the hse with associated weights , where @xmath18 .",
    "alice can not steer implies that alice s measurements have no effect on the system at the other side .",
    "mathematically , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the nonselective postmeasurement state at bob s hand , and @xmath21s are measurements done by alice .     or @xmath22 according to the request from bob , sends the post - measurement state to him through some quantum channel and announces her outcome publicly .",

    ", width=264,height=188 ]    now let us see how joint probabilities for sequential measurements can be constructed according to the classical strategies and indicate some quantum information processing tasks outperforming such classical strategies .",
    "suppose alice measures @xmath25 or @xmath22 at an earlier time @xmath26 on the system , and bob measures @xmath27 or @xmath28 at a later time @xmath29 . here",
    ", three types of possibilities can arise : + ( i ) in the _ non - invasive realist model _",
    "( nirm ) , a hidden variable model ( hvm ) pertinent to the lg scenario , the joint probabilities can be written as @xmath30 this means alice and bob obtain their outcome @xmath31 when measuring @xmath32 according to some predetermined strategy @xmath33 .",
    "this nirm ( [ nirm ] ) leads to an lgi  @xcite .",
    "quantum violation of this inequality has been linked with information processing tasks such as saving memory in computing  @xcite , in the context of qkd  @xcite and randomness generation  @xcite . as only classical communication between two parties",
    "can simulate violation of lgi , it should be emphasised that fully device independent information processing tasks can not be devised with temporal correlations without any other restrictions .",
    "+ ( ii ) there exists a hidden state model ( hsm ) for bob when alice is not capable of steering , and joint probabilities ( equivalent to eq.([hs ] ) ) can be written as @xmath34 violation of any inequality derived from eq.([ns ] ) is a demonstration of temporal steering .",
    "this enables secure key generation under coherent attack by cloning  @xcite .",
    "some semi - device independent tasks can be formulated in this case but we do not focus on this issue here . + ( iii ) in the case when it is known that alice sends quantum systems for bob s measurement , they can always generate a secure key relying on the coherence property of the state and the uncertainty relation according to the original bb84 protocol  @xcite . it may be mentioned here that entanglement in space is described by the tensor product structure between states belonging to different hilbert spaces corresponding to spatially separated systems .",
    "however , time evolution leads to the transformation of states in the same hilbert space .",
    "hence , it is not possible to describe states separated in time by a similar tensor product structure , and correspondingly , there exists no analogous separability criterion for temporal correlations .",
    "in spite of the obvious differences in the joint probability distributions given by eqs.([nirm ] ) and ( [ ns ] ) for the two distinct cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , respectively , we now show that for maximally mixed initial state of any dimension evolving unitarily , they are equivalent under projective measurement . to prove this we introduce a lemma of optimal ensemble for the temporal scenario adapted from an analogous result for the spatial case  @xcite",
    ". no other ensemble can satisfy eq.([hs ] ) iff the optimal ensemble can not satisfy it . + * lemma 1 * : consider a group g of unitary representation @xmath35 on the hilbert space of the system .",
    "suppose @xmath36 ( which alice can measure ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , if we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then there exists a g - covariant optimal ensemble : @xmath41 .",
    "+ * proof * : suppose a hsm @xmath42 exists such that @xmath43 . then , from the condition of lemma we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 . from these we can derive the g - covariant optimal ensemble @xmath46 with @xmath47 with the choice @xmath48 .",
    "+ now we are in a position to prove a theorem . in the context of the maximally mixed initial state , unitary evolution and projective measurements , the lemma 1 holds .",
    "as the maximally mixed state is unitarily invariant , we can take the set of all pure states , @xmath49 , for modelling the hvm , and the probability measure as the haar measure over the unitary group .",
    "( for construction of hvm for @xmath50 invariant bipartite states see @xcite . ) + * theorem 2 * : _ for the initial maximally mixed state under unitary evolution and projective measurements the lgi and tsi violating correlations are equivalent_. + * proof * : if there is a hsm for temporal correlation then it must also have a hvm , i.e. hsm @xmath51 hvm .",
    "this follows trivially since eq.([ns ] ) resembles eq.([nirm ] ) by simply denoting @xmath52 .",
    "+ now we show for projective measurements and unitary evolution that the converse of the above implication , _",
    "i.e. , _ hvm @xmath51 hsm is also true ( tsi violation implies violation of lgi ) . to this end",
    "it is sufficient to show that if a hvm exists , the states at bob s hand can be written through a hse , or in other words , alice can simulate @xmath53 using the hse @xmath54 with the same @xmath55 appearing in the hvm . in the steering protocol bob",
    "asks alice to measure @xmath56 , and after measuring she announces the outcome @xmath6 .",
    "then bob gets the unnormalised state @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the eigenstate of @xmath56 with eigenvalue @xmath6 .",
    "now , using the lemma 1 , the optimal ensemble exists , and without loss of generality let it consist of pure states with the haar measure @xmath59 , s.t .",
    "@xmath60 . from the existence of the hvm",
    ", we have @xmath61 , and since the optimal ensemble exists , we must have also @xmath62 .",
    "as @xmath16 and @xmath63 are pure states , they are unitarily related and the invariance of the haar measure over all spherical rotations implies @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath65 .",
    "hence , the theorem .",
    "@xmath66 + now we present an example of a single qubit system showing that for the above mentioned conditions lgi and tsi are both violated .",
    "note first , that it is possible to derive a _",
    "temporal chsh inequality _",
    "@xcite when the two observers alice ( bob ) choose to measure between their corresponding dichotomic observables @xmath25 and @xmath22 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) at times @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) respectively .",
    "it has been shown under general conditions that for dichotomic measurements the maximal value for lgi is obtained on qubits  @xcite .",
    "hence , it suffices to consider qubit systems as far as dichotomic observables and the maximal value of lgi are concerned . with these measurements",
    "the temporal chsh inequality derived in analogy with spatial one is given by  @xcite @xmath69 .",
    "recently , a steering inequality for spatial correlations has been derived  @xcite that is analogous to the chsh inequality in the bell - nonlocality scenario , in the sense that it forms a necessary and sufficient condition for the case of two parties and dichotomic measurements .",
    "the inequality for spatial correlations obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite can be derived also in the scenario of temporal correlations involving single system steering using the joint probability distribution ( [ ns ] ) ( in a similar way as the joint probability distribution ( [ nirm ] ) leads to a temporal analogue of the chsh inequality or the lgi ) .",
    "thus , the following inequality holds when alice prepares the state for bob from a hs ensemble : @xmath70 the usual lg scenario with unitary evolution of the form @xmath71 , and measurements of the same observable ( say @xmath72 ) at different times can be described as two sequential measurements in a row in the following way .",
    "for the choices of measurements @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , the steering function @xmath75 defined in eq.([nsi ] ) is given by @xmath76 . here",

    "we plot the two steering sums @xmath75 and @xmath82 versus the parameter @xmath83 .",
    "it can be seen from fig.2 that at least one of the steering sums is greater than the no - steering bound , and hence , the steering inequality ( [ nsi ] ) is violated for any value of @xmath83 .",
    "now we show with the above choice of measurements , that an lgi is also violated for any choice of time interval between successive measurements .",
    "the inequality ( [ tchsh ] ) is violated maximally for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these measurements can be mapped as , @xmath86 ; @xmath87 ; @xmath88 ; and @xmath89 .",
    "with permutation of the time indices there exist three different @xmath90-term lgis and as shown in @xcite , there is violation of at least any one of these inequalities for an arbitrary choice of the time interval of successive measurements . with sharp measurement under unitary evolution , for arbitrary time intervals of successive measurements",

    "we now consider generalised measurements ( povms ) on the system undergoing unitary evolution in order to show that the two types of temporal correlations characterised by the violation of tsi and lgi respectively , are inequivalent in this scenario .",
    "it is possible to consider joint measurement of a set of povms even when they do not commute .",
    "a set of povms @xmath92 is said to be compatible if their outcome statistics can be found as marginal of a global povm @xmath93 statistics . here",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 . from this global povm",

    "it has been shown  @xcite that if alice s observables are jointly measurable , the joint statistics can be reproduced by a local model for any bipartite state and any measurement of bob . moreover , for any set of povms at alice s side that is not jointly measurable , there exists a bipartite state and a set of measurements for bob such that the resulting joint statistics violates a bell inequality . for the case of two dichotomic povms non - joint measurement is necessary and sufficient for demonstrating steering and bell nonlocality  @xcite .",
    "however , for three dichotomic povms not satisfying full but with pair wise joint measurability , there is no violation of a large class of bell type inequalities , whereas steering can be shown for this scenario  @xcite .    for temporal correlations with two dichotomic measurements",
