    "the question of spin - torque ( st ) efficiency in switching the free layer in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj ) has been of great interest in recent years @xcite due to spintronic memory s potential as a universal non - volatile memory element @xcite . for mtj with pinned and free layer easy - axis parallel the most efficient prescription has been shown both theoretically and experimentally to be a dc current pulse roughly twice the critical current @xcite . recent experimental research , however , has shown mtj with a second pinned layer , polarized perpendicular to the free layer easy - axis , along the free layer easy - plane axis , can produce switching much faster and more efficiently than in similar co - linear devices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , previous theoretical work by the authors of this paper has shown ac spin - current pulses in mtj with strong free layer easy - plane anisotropy and with both parallel and perpendicularly polarized pinned layers can improve the efficiency further by inducing a resonant response in the free layer @xcite .    for mtjs with weak easy - plane anisotropy ( such as those used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) this purely ac method becomes less effective .",
    "this is a result of the magnetization spending more time at large azimuthal angles through the switching process , where the st from the perpendicular pinned layer is weaker .",
    "conversely , as the magnetization spends more time at large azimuthal angles the strength of the st from the parallel pinned layer st gets larger for dc currents .",
    "in fact , for some cases the strengths of the ac and dc st may intersect allowing the ac st to dominate for low energy orbits and the dc st for high energy orbits .",
    "this tradeoff suggests an alternative means of magnetic switching in mtjs with weak easy - plane anisotropy . instead of using a purely ac or dc spin - current ,",

    "these limits are found by noting only the term @xmath147 in eqn . may have both negative and positive values which is required for eqn . to be satisfied upon integration . for most devices",
    "the range between these two bounds is relatively small , @xmath148 . in such cases",
    "the optimal dc spin - current is roughly twice the critical current @xmath149 as is observed experimentally for switching using only dc spin - currents .",
    "however , for free layers with very weak easy plane anisotropy , i.e. @xmath150 , this range can become quite large . in cases where @xmath3 the minimum local critical current vanishes , @xmath151 as @xmath152 . for these devices we note",
    "the optimal dc spin - current must also be larger than the dc critical current to ensure switching may occur regardless of our choice for @xmath103 and in rare cases where the free layer energy decreases due to thermal fluctuations following the ac pulse .",
    "this means for free layers with weak easy - plane anisotropy @xmath153 . for the uniaxial case simulated in section [ sec : simulations ] we found the the optimal dc current to be slightly larger than the critical current , see fig .",
    "[ fig : jhl_sim_vs_num ] .    for ac pulses where the frequency is constant",
    "one finds the optimal frequency must lie in the range @xmath154 , where recall @xmath98 is the upper bifurcation frequency shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst ] and @xmath155 is the zero energy natural frequency of the free layer",
    ". the lower limit on the optimal ac frequency @xmath156 comes from our desire to maximize the energy overshoot of the free layer .",
    "recall this overshoot is dramatically limited for @xmath99 due to the appearance of a separatrix trajectory which limits the amplitude of the trajectory .",
    "the upper limit @xmath157 is found by noting only the term @xmath158 in eqn . can have both positive and negative values which is required for eqn . to be satisfied upon integration . here",

    "of course for real devices @xmath30 may vary slightly between switching attempts thus @xmath30 should be picked such that it balances maximizing the energy overshoot of the free layer with desired switching probability .    for constant ac spin - current strengths establishing a range of possible values for @xmath120",

    "one can formulate upper and lower bounds for @xmath120 by noting the term @xmath162 in eqn . must have positive and negative values in the range @xmath163 in order for eqn . to be satisfied .",
    "however , these limits lack simple relationships to measurable physical quantities , such as the critical current and the upper bifurcation frequency , thus we exclude their precise formulation here . instead",
    ", we extrapolate limits from the case where @xmath31 is held constant and the ac frequency is set equal to the energy dependent optimal value @xmath164 given by eqn . .",
    "for this case eqn . reduces to with @xmath165 , @xmath122 , and @xmath166 .",
    "this means the limits on the optimal ac spin - current strength are identical to those in of the dc spin - current with similar substitutions , i.e. the optimal ac spin - current strength must be between the largest local critical current and twice the largest local critical current , @xmath167 , in the range @xmath163 where @xmath168 is given by eqn . .",
    "here we have used the alternative lower bounds @xmath169 to insure @xmath170 for @xmath171 in light of the observation that , unlike the dc case , as @xmath172 @xmath173 .    reasserting the restriction that @xmath30 remain constant : for systems where the optimal switching energy is small @xmath174 the @xmath85 trajectory stays close to @xmath131 thus @xmath175 as is the case in when @xmath164 .",
    "this means the limits established previously still apply . from simulations of the free layers in section [ sec : simulations ] with uniaxial anisotropy we found @xmath176 with @xmath177 , well within the predicted range .",
    "for systems with @xmath178 the ac st gets weaker as @xmath69 deviates significantly from @xmath179 .",
    "this corresponds to an effective increase in ac local critical current which in turn shifts the range on the optimal value towards larger currents .",
    "simulations from previous work in ref .",

    "in conclusion we have developed a theoretical description for magnetic switching using consecutive ac and dc spin - current pulses which we have shown may significantly reduce the cost of switching via jhl .",
    "in addition we have provided a set of optimization equations which may be used to numerically determine the spin - current protocols which minimize the jhl for such ac / dc given some assumed form for each of the spin - current parameters .",
    "this includes determining the optimal ac spin - current strength @xmath31 and frequency @xmath30 , the optimal dc spin - current strength @xmath33 , and optimal ac and dc pulse durations .",
    "we have also given the general form of the energy dependent ac / dc spin - current protocol which gives the global minimum jhl for such ac / dc strategies .",
    "in all three cases , purely ac , purely dc , and consecutive ac / dc , this globally optimal protocol acts to time reverse the purely relaxational trajectory of the free layer magnetization from the energy barrier to the energy minimum ."
