    "a variety of systems such as granular materials , compressed emulsions , or molecular glasses , exhibit a non - equilibrium transition from a fluid - like to a solid - like state . when the constituent particles of such systems are so crowded that they are in close contact with one another , the whole system experiences a sudden dynamical arrest , which is referred to as the glass or jamming transition @xcite .",
    "a jammed system is a many - body system blocked in a configuration far from equilibrium , from which it takes too long a time to relax in the laboratory time scale .",
    "jammed systems are usually random packings of particles , which have been the starting point for many studies of liquids and glasses @xcite . a theoretical approached to treat these systems has been developed by edwards and coworkers @xcite who have proposed a statistical mechanics description of such jammed system , in which thermodynamic quantities are computed as flat average over jammed configurations @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite we found that the jamming transition in packings of granular materials and emulsions can be viewed as a phase transition at the critical concentration of random close packing ( rcp ) for frictionless emulsions or random loose packings ( rlp ) for frictional grains .",
    "the transition is characterized by a power behavior and the corresponding set of exponents describing the stress , coordination number and elastic moduli as the system approaches the jamming transition .",
    "this idea has also been investigated for packings of frictionless particles @xcite and colloids @xcite__. _ _ here we elaborate further on the results of @xcite and present our detailed computer simulation studies about many aspects of the jamming transitions in these systems .",
    "we consider packings of spherical deformable particles interacting via friction and frictionless forces .",
    "granular packings are characterized by elastic hertz - mindlin forces @xcite with coulomb friction .",
    "concentrated emulsion systems are modeled as a collection of frictionless deformable droplets interacting via a nonlinear normal force law which is obtained from the analysis of experimental data acquired using confocal microscopy in @xcite .",
    "we first introduce a protocol to generate a series of packings near the jamming transition and beyond for both emulsions and granular materials .",
    "then we study how the construction history of the packings affects the jamming transition .",
    "the existence of frictional tangential forces is one of many generic properties of granular materials . in the elastic hertz - mindlin model",
    "the tangential force is proportional to the tangential displacement , and it is truncated by a coulomb cut - off . both the elastic tangential force and coulomb friction are path - dependent .",
    "the path - dependence in the microscopic interactions leads to the path - dependence of the granular packings at the macroscopic level , an effect that has been shown in several classical experiments @xcite . in our simulations",
    "we find that the construction history affects the properties at the jamming transition in the granular packings through their direct impact on the tangential forces , while in the case of emulsions we do not find any path - dependence .",
    "next , we fully characterize the evolution of the micromechanical and microstructural properties , such as the stress , the coordination number and isostaticity , the radial distribution function , the probability distributions of normal and tangential forces and interparticle contacts , the existence of force chains , the participation number and plasticity index , as the system approaches the jamming transition .",
    "we found that the heterogeneity of interparticle forces increases as the packings approach the jamming transition which is demonstrated by the exponential tail in force distributions and the small values of the participation number .",
    "however , no clear signatures of the jamming transition are observed in structural properties , like the radial distribution functions and the distributions of contacts .    the paper is organized as follows : in section * ii",
    "* we discuss the microscopic force models used in our simulations of granular materials and emulsions . in section",
    "* iii * we give the details of the numerical protocol to generate packings near the jamming transition and beyond and the various measurements to be performed .",
    "the main results of this work are given in section * iv * and we summarize our results in section * v*.",
    "in this section we discuss the microscopic models of inter - particle forces for granular materials and emulsions .",
    "we first briefly review the standard hertz - mindlin model for granular materials ; more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "then we describe the linear `` princen model '' @xcite for the inter - particle forces in emulsions and its nonlinear modification according to experimental data on deformation in concentrated emulsion systems @xcite .",
    "we describe the microscopic interaction between grains by the nonlinear hertz - mindlin normal and tangential forces .",
    "the normal force between two contacting grains at position @xmath0 and @xmath1 with uncompressed radii @xmath2 and @xmath3 is @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the geometric mean of @xmath2 and @xmath6 @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the normal overlap : @xmath9   .$ ] the normal force acts only in compression , i.e. @xmath10 when @xmath11 the effective stiffness @xmath12 is defined in terms of the shear modulus of the grains @xmath13 and the poisson ratio @xmath14 of the material the grains are made . from eq .",
    "( [ gran_normal ] ) , we can see that the normal forces are completely determined by the geometrical configuration of the packing and have nothing to do with the construction history .",
    "the tangential contact force was first calculated by mindlin @xcite for grains under oblique loading . in his model ,",
    "the increment in tangential force is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the variable @xmath17 is defined such that the relative tangential displacement between the two grain centers is @xmath18 . therefore the tangential force is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ gran - tan ] ) over the path taken by the particles in contact with the initial condition , @xmath19 at @xmath20 yielding : @xmath21 as the tangential displacement increases , the elastic tangential force @xmath22 reaches its limiting value given by a coulomb cut - off for granular materials , which is @xmath23 the coulomb cut - off adds a second source of path - dependence to the problem .    from the discussion above",
    ", one can see that a straightforward way to affect the tangential force is to change the frictional coefficient @xmath24 , which controls the maximum value of the ratio between tangential and normal force .",
    "but the elastic tangential force , eq . ( [ gran - tan ] ) , is even more intimately related to the tangential displacement , which is mainly determined by the construction history .",
    "emulsions are a class of material which is both industrially important and exhibits very interesting physics @xcite .",
    "they belong to a wider material class of colloids in that they consist of two immiscible phases one of which is dispersed into the other , the continuous phase .",
    "both of the phases are liquids and their interface is stabilised by the presence of surface - active species .",
    "emulsions are composed of droplets of a liquid ( for instance silicone oil ) stabilized by a surfactant ( like sodium dodecylsulphate ) in a continuum phase ( such as a water and glycerol mixture ) @xcite .",
    "being composed of only liquids , emulsion droplets interact with each other only via normal forces with no solid friction between them .",
    "the determination of an accurate force model for the compression of two droplets is by no means trivial , but it can be simplified in certain limits . for small deformation with respect to the droplets surface area",
    "the laplace pressure remains unchanged and all energy of the applied stress is presumed to be restored in the deformation of the surface .",
    "then the normal repulsive force between two spherical droplets in contacts with uncompressed radii @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be calculated at the microscopic level as : @xmath25 this is known as the princen model @xcite , where @xmath26 is the interfacial tension of droplets , @xmath27 is the normal force between two droplets , @xmath5 is the geometric mean of @xmath2 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the measured contact area between the droplets . as in the granular materials , the normal force acts only in compression .    in @xcite",
    "a linear model was used to relate the area of deformation with the overlap between the spheres @xmath8 , resulting in a linear spring model for the force - law between the droplets .",
    "more detailed calculations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite show that the interdroplet forces in emulsions are better represented by a nonlinear spring @xmath30 with the exponent @xmath31 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 and , more importantly , depending on the number of contact forces acting on the droplet .",
    "recently , bruji _ et al . _ * * @xcite used confocal microscopy to study a compressed polydisperse emulsion .",
    "this system consists of a dense packing of emulsion oil droplets , with a sufficiently elastic surfactant stabilising layer to mimic solid particle behaviour , suspended in a continuous phase fluid . by refractive index matching of the two phases they obtained a 3d image of the packing structure by using confocal microscopy for the imaging of the droplet packings at varying external pressures , i.e. volume fractions .",
    "the key feature of this optical microscopy technique is that only light from the focal plane is detected .",
    "thus 3d images of translucent samples can be acquired by moving the sample through the focal plane of the objective and acquiring a sequence of 2d images .",

    "we may conclude that at low pressures there are very large forces in the packings and the forces are distributed heterogeneously .",
    "this agrees with the picture of force chains which have been visualized in granular matter both in experiment @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "these force chains sustain most of the external loading . at low pressures , the number of the force chains are small and they are well separated @xcite .",

    "our computer simulations of frictionless grains could not reproduce these results as we find evidence of localization even for frictionless droplets .",

    "the distribution at low pressures , containing a plateau and the exponential tail , can be fitted by various expressions .",
