    "the dependence on @xmath14 in both the mixing and decay amplitudes leads to a cancellation of the @xmath15-mixing phase .",
    "therefore , if any significant @xmath0-violation is measured in @xmath1 decays it is an unambiguous signature of new physics .",
    "the decay is of a pseudoscalar meson to two vector mesons , which leads to the final state being a @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd admixture .",
    "therefore , a time - dependent angular analysis is required to extract the @xmath0-violating parameters of the decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) collides protons at a centre - of - mass energy of 14  tev .",
    "the lhc produces @xmath17 @xmath18 quark pairs per nominal year of data - taking @xmath19 when operating at an instantaneous luminosity of @xmath20 . the lhcb spectrometer @xcite instruments one forward region about the @xmath21 collision point .",
    "the forward geometry captures approximately one - third of all @xmath8 hadrons produced and increases the probability of both @xmath8 hadrons from the @xmath18 pairs being within the acceptance , which improves the efficiency of flavour tagging .",
    "a silicon vertex detector , with sensors perpendicular to the beam axis , is situated close to the interaction region in a secondary vacuum .",
    "the detector provides accurate determination of primary and secondary vertices leading to a proper - time resolutions of approximately 40  fs in hadronic @xmath8-decays such as @xmath1 . tracking stations either side of a 1.2  t dipole magnet produce momentum measurements with an accuracy of a few parts per mille .",
    "there are two ring - imaging erenkov detectors , with 3 different radiators , that allow identification of @xmath22 from @xmath23 over the momentum range 1 to @xmath24 .    in addition",
    ", the detector includes an electromagnetic calorimeter , a hadron calorimeter and a muon detector .",
    "these components are critical for identifying large transverse momentum , @xmath25 , electrons , photons , hadrons and muons from @xmath8-hadron decay in the initial hardware stage ( level-0 ) of the lhcb trigger .",
    "the level-0 trigger reduces the 40  mhz collision rate to 1  mhz .",
    "all data is then transferred from the detector to a dedicated cpu farm where the higher level trigger ( hlt ) algorithms are performed .",
    "initially an association between the high @xmath25 objects that satisfy the level-0 trigger and tracks with large impact parameter to the primary vertex is sought . if this is successful , exclusive and inclusive hlt algorithms are executed resulting in a 2  khz output rate to disk .",

    "the resulting data are processed by the complete lhcb reconstruction software .",
    "a dedicated sample containing events with a @xmath1 decay is used to evaluate the selection efficiency .",
    "minimum bias events are selected rarely by the level-0 trigger and the hlt .",
    "therefore , an inclusive sample of 34 million events containing @xmath18 quark pairs is used to estimate the background . due to the very large number of @xmath18 pairs that will be produced at lhcb",
    ", the inclusive @xmath18 sample only corresponds to approximately 15  minutes of data taking at the nominal instantaneous luminosity ; this leads to large uncertainties on the background estimates .",

    "events within 40 @xmath29 of the @xmath15 mass are considered as signal ; the mass interval corresponds to approximately @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mass resolution .",
    "once level-0 and hlt trigger selections have been applied there are 4000 signal events expected in every @xmath35 of integrated luminosity , which corresponds to one nominal year of lhc operation .",
    "the event yield is calculated assuming the measured branching fraction @xmath36 @xcite ; the measured value lies within theoretically predicted range @xcite .",
    "the background remaining in the @xmath18 inclusive simulation sample is found to consist of combinatoric @xmath15 candidates .",
