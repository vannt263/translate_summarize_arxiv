    "the ultraviolet photons from hot stars , such as main - sequence ob stars or the central stars of planetary nebula ( cspn ) will dissociate and ionize the surrounding circumstellar and interstellar gas . in the classical picture ,",
    "the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) photons with energies @xmath6 photoionize the hydrogen gas , forming an region bounded by a relatively sharp ionization front ( if ) , while the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons with energies @xmath7 penetrate the if to form a neutral photodissociation region ( pdr ) that surrounds the region . the dissociation of @xmath3 in such a pdr is dominated by a two - step radiative process , in which absorption of an fuv photon leaves the @xmath3 molecule in an electronically excited state , from which it has a certain probability ( @xmath8% ) of decaying to the vibrational continuum of the ground electronic state .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite , a classical extended pdr can not exist if the fuv flux is sufficiently weak compared with the euv flux at the if , rather the if and dissociation front ( df ) should merge .",
    "@xcite considered the case of regions around ob stars and found that this regime was most relevant for cases in which the dust optical depth through the ionized gas is low , which corresponds to a low ionization parameter ( the ionization parameter is a dimensionless number equal to the ratio of the number density of ionizing photons to the number density of hydrogen nuclei ) . to date , no models have been calculated of the structure and emission properties of such fronts , which are also expected to show strong deviations from static chemical and ionization equilibrium .    in this paper , we calculate in detail the internal dynamics and chemistry of merged ionization / dissociation fronts ( if / dfs ) , concentrating on the particular case of compact photoevaporating molecular knots in evolved planetary nebulae ( pne ) , such as are seen in the helix nebula ( @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ohf07 ) ) . the stellar spectrum from the hot central star of a pn is harder than that from an ob star , leading to an euv luminosity that is much greater than the fuv luminosity .",
    "in addition , the ionization parameter of the knots is much lower than is typically seen in regions , resulting in very little attenuation of the euv flux by recombinations in the ionized gas .",
    "both these factors place the knots firmly in the merged if / df regime .",
    "the most comprehensive existing theoretical study of pdrs in planetary nebulae is that of , who present detailed modeling of the time - dependent evolution of an expanding circumstellar shell as the luminosity and spectrum of the cspn evolves , finding that soft x - rays can be important in exciting the molecular gas at late times .",
    "however , showed that this is not the case in the helix since it is only in the euv band that the cspn luminosity is sufficient to excite the knot pdrs",
    ". used an analytic treatment of the region , which is assumed to absorb all the euv radiation , and were thus unable to model the case of a merged if / df .",
