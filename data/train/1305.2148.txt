    "a record - breaking event is an event that is larger ( smaller ) than all previous events in the observational sequence of some physical measurements .",
    "sequences of record - breaking events can be extracted for various natural phenomena where records of the variability of different measurements exist .",
    "the best known example is weather , where daily observations of temperatures are documented and new record - breaking temperatures are often reported .",
    "monitoring such record - breaking temperatures can be used to infer possible trends in the weather variability @xcite .",
    "for example , the excess of maximum record - breaking temperatures over minimum record - breaking ones is taken to be direct evidence of global warming .",
    "other natural phenomena for which record - breaking events play an important role include earthquakes  @xcite , floods  @xcite , forest - fires , volcanic eruptions , and solar events  @xcite , to name only a few .",
    "record - breaking events or records form a subsequence of all recorded measurements and are only distinguished based on their sizes or magnitudes . since a record - breaking event is defined as the largest event up to its time of occurrence , a subsequent event becomes the next record - breaking event only if it exceeds the size of the previous record and all events in between are smaller than both records  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical framework to analyze record - breaking events is related to extreme value statistics and in most cases assumes events which are independent and identically distributed ( _ i.i.d . _ ) @xcite . in this case",
    "several statistical properties of records are independent of their underlying distribution and yield to analytical treatment @xcite .",
    "this standard treatment of records assumes that the underlying events occur equidistant in time . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can generalize the analysis of record - breaking events to situations in which the occurrence of events grows stochastically in time .",
    "it was found that such a temporal modification preserves several fundamental properties of the original model , i.e. independence from the underlying distribution of the _ i.i.d .",
    "_ events .",
    "in contrast the situation can be significantly different if one considers more complicated stochastic processes . in recent years",
    "some progress has been made in analyzing records and record - breaking events in non-_i.i.d .",
    "_ random sequences including sequences with time - varying underlining distributions as well as sequences with strongly correlated events .",
    "for example , a theoretical and observational analysis was performed for daily record temperatures in philadelphia to investigate the effects of temperature trends and correlations @xcite . in that work",
    "the authors found that the small rate of increase in the mean temperatures does not significantly influence the statistics of record - breaking events over the time span of the observations .",
    "the authors also considered the role of temporal correlations between events by generating synthetic time series with correlations decaying as a power - law .",
    "it was reported that the frequency and magnitude of the record - breaking events was almost identical to those obtained using",
    "_ random variables and were not sensitive to the power - law exponent of the correlation function .",
    "events drawn from independent random variables but with progressively broadening or sharpening distributions were considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for a power - law growth of the width of the distribution three regimes can be identified if one considers the growth of the mean number of records .",
    "these regimes correspond to the asymptotic behavior of the tail of the distribution according to gumbel , frchet , and weibull classes often studied in the context of extreme value statistics  @xcite .",
    "to further investigate the effects of correlations in time series , record - breaking events in sequences generated by random walks and lvy flights were also considered@xcite .",
    "it was found that the statistics of records are independent of the distribution of jumps .",
    "the average number of records and its standard deviation grow as a square root of the number of time steps which implies that fluctuations remain large and of the same order as the mean .",
    "for related stationary and non - stationary stochastic processes with long - range memory , the situation is more complicated but memory typically leads to significant deviations from the _ i.i.d . _",
    "behavior  @xcite .",
    "despite this progress for some non-_i.i.d .",
    "_ processes , we are still far away from a general understanding of record - breaking events and their properties in complex systems that are often observed in nature . to understand such systems and specifically the emergence of complex patterns and long - range spatio - temporal correlations in physical systems ,",
    "various cellular automata have been studied in the past .",
    "usually such models possess rather simple and intuitive rules of evolution which mimic real observed properties of dissipative complex systems .",
    "of particular interest are driven nonlinear threshold systems exhibiting avalanche - like behavior with scale invariant statistics where effects of correlations and self - organization play a crucial role @xcite .",
    "a plethora of models has been introduced to illustrate such behavior . among them",
    "the sandpile model @xcite , manna model @xcite , the olami - feder - christensen model @xcite , and the forest - fire model @xcite are the most prominent ones .",
    "they all exhibit scale - invariant behavior in the distribution of avalanches with respect to their size and duration when driven into a steady state .",
    "they also possess nontrivial spatio - temporal correlation patterns and serve as conceptual models to explain such diverse phenomena as earthquakes , forest - fires , landslides , etc .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the influence of spatio - temporal correlations on records by studying the record - breaking statistics of avalanches in the four cellular automata described above . for each of the models we study the record statistics both in magnitude and time domains by constructing various distributions and the corresponding averages .",
    "our numerical simulations show that there are significant differences to what would be expected for _ i.i.d .",
    "_ random variables .",
    "the most pronounced deviations are observed in the case of the ofc model with a strong dependence on the conservation parameter of the model .",

    "( [ pdfwkn3 ] ) , for the probability that the @xmath0th record is broken after @xmath1 time steps in the case of _ i.i.d . _ random variables .",
