    "grs 1915 + 105 has unique and striking properties that sharply distinguish it from the 40 known binaries that are believed to contain a stellar - mass black hole ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 , hereafter rm06 ) .",
    "it is the most reliable source of highly relativistic radio jets in the galaxy ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ; fender et al .",
    "1999 ; miller - jones et al .",
    "2006 ) , and it is the prototype of the microquasars ( mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) .",
    "grs  1915 + 105 ( hereafter grs1915 ) frequently displays extraordinary x - ray variability that is not mimicked by any other black hole system ( e.g. , belloni et al .",
    "2000 ; klein - wolt et al .",
    "its black hole ( bh ) primary is unique in displaying a constellation of high - frequency qpos ( hfqpos ) , namely , 41  hz , 67  hz , 113  hz and 166  hz . the 67  hz qpo is atypically coherent ( @xmath2 ) and relatively strong ( rms @xmath3% ) compared to the hfqpos observed for six other accreting bhs ( morgan et al .",
    "1997 ; mcclintock & remillard 2006 , hereafter mr06 ) . among the 17 transient and ephemeral systems that contain a dynamically confirmed bh ( rm06 ) ,",
    "grs1915 is unique in having remained active for more than a decade since its discovery during outburst in 1992 ( mr06 ) .",
    "grs1915 has an orbital period of 33.5 days and is the widest of the bh binaries ( bhbs ) , and it likely contains the most massive stellar bh ( greiner et al .",
    "2001 ; harlaftis & greiner 2004 ; rm06 ) .",
    "zhang et al .  ( 1997 ) first argued that the relativistic jets and extraordinary x - ray behavior of grs1915 are due to the high spin of its bh primary . in their approximate analysis , they found that both grs1915 and gro  j165540 had high spins , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mass and angular momentum of the bh ; @xmath8 for a schwarzschild hole and @xmath9 for an extreme kerr hole ) .",
    "subsequently , gierlinki et al .  ( 2001 ) estimated the spin of gro  j165540 and lmc x3 .",
    "recently , we have firmly established the methodology pioneered by zhang et al . and gierlinki et al .",
    "by constructing relativistic accretion disk models ( li et al .",
    "2005 ; davis et al .",
    "2005 ) and by modeling in detail the effects of spectral hardening ( davis et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "we have made these analysis tools publicly available via xspec ( _ kerrbb _ and _ bhspec _ ; arnaud 1996 ) . using this modern methodology ,",
    "spins have now been estimated for several stellar - mass bhs , most notably : gro  j165540 and 4u  154347 ( shafee et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter s06 ) , grs1915 ( middleton et al .",
    "2006 ) , and lmc x-3 ( davis et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "all of the plausibly reliable estimates of bh spin to date , including the present work , depend on fits to the x - ray continuum and measurements of the x - ray luminosity , coupled with optical measurements of bh mass , orbital inclination , and distance ( e.g. , s06 ) . in this paper",
    ", we show that grs1915 does indeed harbor a rapidly - spinning kerr bh as suggested by zhang et al .",
    "however , in the case of gro  j165540 the results obtained by ourselves and others show that the spin of this bh is modest ( @xmath10 ; s06 ; gierlinki et al .",
    "2001 ) and much lower than the value ( @xmath11 ) suggested by zhang et al .",
    "the high spin reported herein for grs1915 contradicts the modest spin value ( @xmath12 ) reported by middleton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and we discuss this inconsistency in detail in  5.3 .",
    "our spin estimates are based on an analysis of the `` thermal state '' of bhbs ( mr06 ) whose remarkably simple properties have been recognized for decades .",
    "basic principles of physics predict that accreting bhs should radiate thermal emission from the inner accretion disk , and a multi - temperature model of a thin accretion disk was published shortly after the launch of _ uhuru _ ( pringle & rees 1972 ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov & thorne 1973 ; lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) . a nonrelativistic approximation to this model , now referred to as _ diskbb _ in xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) was first implemented and used extensively by mitsuda et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and makishima et al .",
    "the two parameters of the model are the temperature @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 of the inner edge of the accretion disk . in their review on bhbs , tanaka and lewin ( 1995 )",
    "show for a few bhbs ( see their fig.3.14 ) that as the thermal disk flux varies by 12 orders of magnitude the value of @xmath14 remains constant to within @xmath15% .",
    "this striking result prompted tanaka & lewin to comment that @xmath16 , which was typically found to be @xmath17 tens of kilometers , must be related to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( @xmath18 . the stability of @xmath14 has by now been observed in great detail for many bhbs ( e.g. , ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ; sobczak et al.1999 ; sobczak et al .",
    "2000 ; park et al .",
    "2004 ) . further strong evidence for a thermal disk interpretation is provided by plots of the observed disk flux versus apparent temperature , which track the expected @xmath19 relation for a constant inner disk radius ( gierlinki & done 2004 ; kubota & done 2004 ) .",
    "spin can be determined because it has a profound impact on the behavior and properties of a bh .",
    "quantitatively and specifically , consider two bhs with the same mass @xmath6 , one a schwarzschild hole and the other an extreme kerr hole .",
    "for the kerr hole , the radius of the isco is six times smaller and the binding energy at the isco seven times greater than for the schwarzschild hole .",
    "relative to the spinless bh , the much deeper gravity well of the extreme kerr hole hardens the x - ray spectrum and greatly increases its efficiency for converting accreted rest mass into radiant energy .",
    "the continuum fitting approach that we use is based on measuring spectral shape ( hardness ) and luminosity ( efficiency ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  ",
    "24 we discuss respectively the selection , reduction , and analysis of the data . in  5 we present our results for grs1915 and compare them with those of middleton et al.(2006 ) , and we present a table summary of the spins of grs1915 and three other bhs .",
    "the discussion topics in  6 include a description of our methodology , our rationale for favoring low - luminosity data , the natal origin of bh spin , the significance of measuring bh spin , and a proposed test of our model . in  7 we offer our conclusions .",
    "our primary resource is the huge and growing archive of data on grs1915 that has been obtained during the past decade using the large - area pca detector on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; swank 1998 ) .",
    "many bhbs have by now been observed hundreds of times , but none has been observed more often than grs1915 .",
    "the _ net _",
    "inventory of _ rxte _ pointed observations on this source from 1996 to the present now totals 4.7 ms , which corresponds to 1311 pointed observations each of duration 110 ks .",
    "the unique properties of grs1915 and the great volume of perplexing data present a serious challenge : is it possible to identify extended periods of time when grs1915 was in a genuine pacific state dominated by thermal emission , and can one use these data to obtain a reliable estimate of spin ?",
    "we believe we have answered `` yes '' to this challenge by using a quantitative definition of the `` thermal state '' that is based on our exhaustive studies of many bhbs and bh candidates ( mr06 ; rm06 ) . for a discussion of bh states , see mr06 and rm06 , and for precise definitions of the three outburst states  including the thermal state  see table 2 in rm06 . for complete overviews on the evolution and energetics of bh states for six canonical bhbs ( i.e. , excluding grs1915 ) , see  5 in rm06 .    in the thermal state ( formerly high / soft state and `` thermal dominant '' state ;",
    "mr06 ) , which is the only state relevant to this work , the flux is dominated by blackbody - like emission from the inner accretion disk , qpos are absent or very weak , and the rms variability is also weak .",
    "quantitatively , the thermal state is defined by two timing criteria and one spectral criterion applied over the energy band 220 kev ( mr06 ; rm06 ) : ( 1 ) qpos are absent or very weak : amplitude @xmath20% ; ( 2 ) the power continuum level integrated over 0.110  hz is @xmath21 rms ; and ( 3 ) the fraction of the emission contributed by the accretion disk component @xmath22 exceeds 75% of the total emission .",
    "we now turn to describing how we screened the _ rxte _",
    "data archive for grs1915 and identified 20 observations as belonging strictly to the thermal state .",
    "as a starting point , all of these individual pca observations of grs1915 that were publicly available as of 2005 january 1 were organized into 640 data segments , where we sometimes combined brief observations that occurred within an interval of several hours .",
    "we then screened for temporal variability , and 338 relatively `` steady '' observations were identified for which the rms fluctuations in the count rate divided by the mean count rate was @xmath23% using 1-s time bins .",
    "next , a hardness ratio ( @xmath24 kev / @xmath25 kev ) was computed for each of these 338 observations using the scheme of muno et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to normalize the pca count rates for several epochs with different pca gain settings .",
    "we then selected a gross sample of 85 observations that displayed the softest spectra ( @xmath26 0.30 ) . at this point",
    ", we strictly applied the three criteria , which define the thermal state . applying the timing criteria ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) stated above ( i.e. , qpo amplitude @xmath20% and rms continuum power @xmath21 rms ) , left us with 47 candidate observations .",
    "finally , based on a decomposition of the spectrum into thermal and nonthermal components , which is described in the following section , we obtained our sample of 20 observations that additionally meets criterion ( 3 ) given above , namely , that the thermal disk component contributes @xmath27% of the total 220 kev flux .",
    "it is this final sample of 20 strictly thermal - state observations that is the focus of this work .",
    "a catalog of the 20 _ rxte _ observations , which span a time interval of 7.5 years , is given in table  1 .",
    "finally , we screened the 11 archival observations of grs1915 obtained by the _",
    "advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) _ and identified two appropriate thermal - state observations .",
    "these two observations , which were made on 1994 september 27 and 1999 april 15 , are also cataloged in table  1 . in selecting these data",
    "we only applied the spectral criterion ( number 3 ) mentioned above and applied it only over the observed bandpass of 1.2 - 10 kev .",
    "the limited count rates ( table  1 ) did not allow us to exercise the two timing criteria . because of these limitations , we are somewhat less certain that these observations correspond to the true thermal state than is the case for the _ rxte _ observations .",
    "in our spectral analysis of the _ rxte _ data , we only include pulse - height spectra from pcu-2 because it is almost always operating and because fits to the simple power - law ( pl ) spectrum of the crab show that this is the best calibrated proportional counter unit ( pcu ) .",
    "data reduction tools from heasoft version 5.2 were used to screen the event files and spectra .",
    "data were taken in the `` standard 2 mode , '' which provides coverage of the pca bandpass every 16  s. data from all xe gas layers of pcu-2 were added to make the spectra .",
    "background spectra were obtained using the tool _",
    "pcabackest _ and the latest `` bright source '' background model .",
    "background spectra were subtracted from the total spectra using the tool _",
    "mathpha_. redistribution matrix files and ancillary response files were freshly generated individually for each pcu layer and combined into a single response file using the tool _",
    "pcarsp_. in fitting each of the 20 pulse - height spectra (  4 ) , we used response files that were targeted to the time of each grs1915 observation .",
    "it is well known that fits to pca spectra of the crab nebula reveal residuals as large as 1% , and we therefore added the customary systematic error of 1% to all pcu energy channels using the tool _ grppha _ ( e.g. , sobczak et al .",
    "2000 ) . because large fit - residuals are often found below 3 kev , which can not be accounted for by any plausible spectral feature , and because the spectrum becomes background - dominated and the calibration less certain above 25 kev , we restricted our spectral analysis to the 325 kev band , which is customary for analysis of pca spectra obtained after the gain change of 1999 march .",
    "we used this same 325 kev band even for the 14 pca data sets that were obtained prior to 1999 march .",

    "as in s06 , we again found it necessary to correct the effective area of the pca despite a recent official correction ( jahoda et al .",
    "2006 ) , which was made using a nominal and approximate spectrum of the crab nebula ( zombeck et al .",
    "we have chosen to correct our 325 kev fluxes to the most definitive crab spectrum available , namely , the pl index ( @xmath34 ) and normalization ( @xmath35 ph  @xmath36  s@xmath37 ) given by toor & seward ( 1974 ) and the hydrogen column given by willingale et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which implies a 3.025.0 kev flux of @xmath38 .",
    "we consider the old toor and seward results more reliable than the current but preliminary results that are summarized in kirsch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "we made these corrections to the effective area as follows : we selected 25 crab observations distributed over the 7.5 years spanned by the 20 _ rxte _ observations .",
    "the crab pulse - height spectra were corrected for dead time and joined with their response files in the same manner as described above for the grs1915 spectra .",
    "the crab spectra were fitted over the range 325 kev using a simple pl model with the hydrogen column fixed at @xmath39 @xmath36 ( willingale et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the energy flux was computed over this same interval .",
    "the fluxes so computed systematically exceeded the crab flux quoted above by the factor @xmath40 ( rms ) .",
    "therefore , the fluxes we obtained from the analysis of the 20 spectra (  4 ) were all corrected downward by the reciprocal factor 0.917 .",
    "for the two _ asca _ spectra ( table  1 ) , we analyzed only the data from the gis2 detector ; the calibration of the gis3 detector , in particular its gain correction , is less certain .",
    "we ignored the data from the sis detectors because grs1915 is bright and the pileup effects are troublesome ( kotani et al .",
    "2000 ) , which makes the sis data less suitable for fitting the broad continuum spectrum that is of interest here .",
    "starting with the unscreened _ asca _ data files obtained from the heasarc , we followed as closely as possible the data reduction procedures and criteria mentioned in kotani et al .",
    "the gis events for each detector were summed within a radius of @xmath41 centered on the source position , and the response function of the x - ray telescope ( serlemitsos et al .",
    "1995 ) was applied .",
    "background was not subtracted for this bright source . a gain correction based on the instrumental gold m -",
    "edge was applied .",
    "a systematic error of 2% was added to each energy channel to account for calibration uncertainties , and the standard dead time corrections were applied .",
    "no correction to the effective area is required because the gis effective - area calibrations were based on the toor & seward ( 1974 ) spectrum of the crab ( makishima et al .",
    "all of the data analysis and model fitting was performed using heasoft version 5.2 and xspec version 12.2 ( arnaud 1996 ) except for the model _ bhspec _ ( see below ) , which requires xspec version 11.3 .",
    "we first consider the most conventional analysis of all 22 data sets ( i.e. , 20 _ rxte _ plus two _ asca _ ) using the simple multi - temperature disk blackbody model _ diskbb _ and then describe three successive analyses of these data sets using our relativistic disk model .",
    "in all the _ rxte _ spectral fits described herein , we fixed the value of the hydrogen column density at @xmath42  @xmath36 .",
    "this value is consistent with the values determined from an analysis of the _ asca _ gis data for grs1915 by ebisawa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who found that @xmath43 was `` always within the range @xmath44  @xmath36 , '' and by ourselves for observations # 1 and # 2 , respectively : @xmath45  @xmath36 and @xmath46  @xmath36 (  4.1 ) .",
    "our adopted value of @xmath43 is also in reasonable agreement with the _ bepposax _ value determined by feroci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , @xmath47  @xmath36 , and with radio and millimeter determinations of the interstellar column , @xmath48  @xmath36 ( chapuis & corbel 2004 ) .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss in detail the analysis of the _ rxte _ data over the energy range 325  kev .",
    "all of these fits required a nonthermal `` tail '' component of emission plus two additional weak line and edge components , which are described below . on the other hand , the _ asca _ gis pulse - height spectra , which were analyzed over the energy range 1.28  kev required neither a tail component nor the edge components .",
    "apart from these simplifications , the only difference between the analysis of the _ asca _ data and the _ rxte _ data is that in the former case we allowed @xmath43 to vary freely .",
    "because of the restricted bandpass of _ asca _ and the limitations associated with screening these data (  2 ) , we consider the _ asca _ results somewhat less reliable than the _ rxte _ results , although in the case of gro  j165540 we found good agreement between the two , most notably in the case of one simultaneous observation ( s06 ) .",

    "then , by adding an additional broad fe absorption component ( smedge ) with an edge energy restricted to the range 6.99.0 kev , we were able to obtain good fits to all 20 _ rxte _ spectra .",

    "neither a smedge component nor a pl or other tail component of emission was included in these 1.2 - 8.0 kev fits .      as in s06",
    ", we estimate @xmath70 by fitting the thermal component of the x - ray continuum using a fully relativistic model of a thin accretion disk around a kerr bh ( li et al .",
    "the model , which is available in xspec under the name _ kerrbb _ , includes all relativistic effects , such as frame dragging , doppler boosting , gravitational redshift , and light bending .",
    "it also includes self - irradiation of the disk ( `` returning radiation '' ) and the effects of limb darkening .",
    "a limitation of _ kerrbb _ is that one of its three key fit parameters , namely , the spectral hardening factor @xmath71 that relates the color temperature @xmath72 and the effective temperature  of the disk emission ( @xmath71  =  t/  ; shimura & takahara 1995 ; merloni et al .",
    "2000 ) is treated as a constant .",
    "because of this limitation of _ kerrbb _ our work is based on a second , complementary relativistic disk model called _ bhspec _ , which has also been implemented in xspec ( davis et al .",

    "the data points for five of the observations in figures 2 and 3 are enclosed by blue circles .",

    "the values of chi - square are relatively high . as we show in  4.2.4",
    ", the addition of a minor feature to the spectral model allows us to obtain good fits ( @xmath91 ) to these four crucial spectra without significantly affecting the values of the two important parameters , @xmath70 and .",
    "finally , we briefly summarize our _ asca _ gis2 results for the case @xmath77 . for observation # 1 ( table 1 ) , we find @xmath92 ,  @xmath93 g  s@xmath37 , @xmath94 @xmath36 and @xmath95 for 95 dof . for observation",
    "# 2 we find @xmath96 ,  @xmath97 g  s@xmath37 , @xmath98 @xmath36 and @xmath99 for 159 dof . a gaussian absorption line with a central energy of @xmath100  kev and an equivalent width of 0.21  kev was included in the fit to observation # 1 , but was not required or included for observation # 2 .",
    "no pl or other tail component of emission was included in these 1.2 - 8.0 kev fits .      in the analysis of the _ rxte _ observations described above in",
    " 4.1 and  4.2.1 , we found that the pl component sometimes makes a modest contribution to the total flux at energies below @xmath101  kev .",
    "we question whether this contribution from the pl is physically reasonable , since the pl is believed to be produced by comptonization of the soft disk photons by a scattering corona . in order to check if this pl flux affects our results , we next fitted the tail component of emission using a more physically - motivated model for which the disk component dominates more strongly below several kev .",
    "namely , we used a thermal comptonization model ( _ comptt _ ) in place of the simple pl component ( titarchuk 1994 ; hua & titarchuk 1995 ) .",
    "a drawback of _ comptt _ is its complexity ; it has four principal parameters : the temperature of the soft input photons @xmath102 , the coronal plasma temperature @xmath103 , the optical depth of the corona @xmath104 , and a normalization parameter .    in determining the spin , we considered three fixed values of @xmath102 (  5.1 ) that are centered on 2  kev , which is the nominal value of the disk temperature determined in  4.1 .",
    "as we show in  5.1 , this choice is completely unimportant .",
    "we also considered two values of the coronal temperature , @xmath105  kev and @xmath106  kev , and we found that this choice is also unimportant .",
    "for the purposes of the discussion at hand , we adopt the values @xmath107  kev and @xmath106  kev .",
    "thus , we are left with two fit parameters , @xmath104 and the normalization constant .",
    "when fitting with no constraints on @xmath104 , we found that the parameter sometimes ran away to unphysically low values ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we therefore set a hard lower bound on the optical depth : @xmath109 ( for @xmath110  kev ) .",
    "this bound is based on the values of the photon index determined in  4.1 ( @xmath111 ) and a simple calculation that relies on the zeldovich approximation as described in  7.5 of rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) .",
    "finally , we set _",
    "comptt s _ geometry switch to @xmath112 , thereby selecting disk geometry and interpolated values of the @xmath113 parameter .",
    "our results for the fitting parameters and other quantities are summarized in figure  4 for @xmath77 only .",
    "the structure of this figure is identical with that of figure  2 except that @xmath54 is replaced by @xmath104 and the pl flux @xmath61 is replaced by the 220 kev flux in the _ comptt _ component @xmath114 .",
    "modeling the tail component using the thermal comptonization model is an effective way to check on the effects of pl flux below @xmath101 kev (  4.2.2 ) .",
    "however , this model is quite complex .",
    "therefore , we now consider a simpler model that allows us to cut off the flux at low energy in an ad hoc way , namely , a simple pl model (  4.2.1 ) that is cutoff at lower energies by an exponential ( _ expabs*power _ in xspec ) .",
    "this model has three parameters , the two standard pl parameters (  4.2.1 ) plus a cutoff parameter @xmath115 . in ",
    "5.1 we consider three plausible choices for the cutoff energy ( @xmath116   kev ) , but for now we consider only the central value , @xmath117  kev .",
    "the fit results for this simple model are summarized in figure  5 , which is strictly identical in structure to figure  2 .",
    "the results shown are for @xmath77 .      five values of chi - square in figure  2 ( observation nos . 3 , 4 , 12 , 14 & 17 ) are relatively high , @xmath118 , and the fit to observation no .",
    "14 is unacceptably high , @xmath119 ( 44 dof ) .",
    "furthermore , these same observations give similarly high values of chi - square for the comptonization model ( fig .  4 ) and the cutoff pl model ( fig .",
    "5 ) as well .",
    "these particular observations are important because four of them are low - luminosity observations (  4.2.1 ,  6.1 ,",
    "appendix ) . in an effort to improve the fits for these five observations",
    ", we followed the lead of kotani et al .",
    "( 2000 ;  4.1 ) .",
    "specifically , we added to our spectral model a sharp edge feature ( _ edge _ in xspec ) , which we bounded to lie in the range 813 kev , and we then refitted these five pha spectra .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  6 , where the new parameters and fluxes are plotted as red open circles and the small black data points have been copied from figure  2 .",
    "apart from the new fit results , figure  6 differs from figure  2 in that it includes a pair of additional panels displaying the parameters of the edge component , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "note in figure  6 that the optical depth of the edge component is modest , @xmath122 , and that the addition of this feature significantly reduces the optical depth of the smedge component .",
    "figure  6 contains two important messages .",
    "first , with the addition of the edge component all of the five fits are now good ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "secondly , the values of @xmath70 and  are scarcely affected by the inclusion of the sharp edge ( see  5.5 , fig .  6 ) .",
    "finally , we found that the sharp edge gave the same improvements in chi - square and the same degree of stability in the values of @xmath70 and  as well when applied to the comptonization (  4.2.2 ) and cutoff pl models (  4.2.3 ) .",
    "the disk fraction @xmath22 , which is the ratio of the 220 kev thermal disk flux to the flux in the tail component ( pl , compton , or cutoff pl ) is an important parameter and it is therefore displayed in the top panels in figures  15 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath22 in figure  1 never dips below 0.75 for any of the 20 observations , which is a principal selection criterion that we used in selecting these data (  2 ) via the nonrelativistic analysis (  4.1 ) .",
    "the typical value is @xmath124% , although for two observations @xmath22 does fall below 80% . in the case of the relativistic analyses using the pl tail model ,",
    "the values of @xmath22 are significantly higher with typical values @xmath125% and with few values below 90% ( figures 2 , 3 and 5 ) .",
    "the _ comptt _ tail model consistently gives the highest values of @xmath22 , which approach 100% . in",
    "4.2.2 , we expressed some reservations about the simple pl component s contribution to the total flux at low energies .",
    "however , as we show in  5 , our results for the pl model agree well with the results obtained for the other two tail models .",
    "a careful comparison of figures  15 shows that the gaussian line parameters ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) , the line s equivalent width ( @xmath59 ) , and the smedge parameters ( @xmath86 and @xmath126 ) change very little whether the disk is modeled with _ diskbb _ or with _ kerrbb2 _ and whether the model for the tail component is a simple pl , a comptonized plasma , or a cutoff pl .",
    "this strongly indicates that these ancillary parameters , which are required in order to obtain a good fit , are quite unimportant .",
    "furthermore , the gaussian and smedge components are relatively weak : the gaussian line has an @xmath127 kev , comparable to the @xmath128  kev value reported by kotani et al .  ( 2000 ) , and the optical depth of the smedge component is moderate , @xmath129 ( for comparison , see ebisawa et al.1994 ; sobczak et al .  1999 , 2000 ;",
    "park et al .  2004 ) .    finally , if one considers the principal relativistic fit parameters  @xmath70 and   plotted in figures  25 , one sees that the corresponding values of these parameters from figure to figure are little affected by the choice of model for the tail component ( i.e. , pl , compton , or cutoff pl ) or by the inclusion of a sharp absorption edge (  4.2.4 , fig .",
    "thus , we conclude that our results are robust to the details of the analysis  that is , they depend weakly on the line and edge parameters , and they depend weakly as well on the choice of the model for the tail component of emission .",
    "in this section , we present our results in the form of plots of the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath70 versus the dimensionless luminosity @xmath130 .",
    "the eddington - scaled luminosity @xmath76 is computed from the two _ kerrbb2 _ fit parameters @xmath70 and  and the bh mass @xmath6 (  4.2 ) . in this section",
    "we consider in turn the following topics : ( 1 ) our results for the spin of grs1915 ; ( 2 ) the effects of varying @xmath6 , @xmath33 and @xmath80 ; ( 3 ) a comparison of our results with those of middleton et al .  ( 2006 ) ; ( 4 ) the effects of returning radiation and torque ; ( 5 ) a lower limit on the spin parameter of @xmath131 ; and ( 6 ) a comparison of this limit with the spins of three other sources .",
    "an important point should be mentioned at the outset .",
    "the model that we employ to fit the continuum spectrum of grs1915 is physically consistent only if ( i ) the accretion disk is in an optically thick thermal state , and ( ii ) the disk is geometrically thin in the vertical direction . through the stringent data selection",
    "described earlier we have ensured the first requirement , but the second criterion requires a further restriction of the data . in ",
    "6.1 we make use of a newtonian analysis to estimate the disk thickness , and in the appendix we describe a fully relativistic analysis . based on these two analyses ,",
    "we show that the accretion disk will be _ thin _ at all radii , with a height to radius ratio less than 0.1 , only if the accretion luminosity is less than 30% of the eddington luminosity .",
    "only five observations with rxte and one observation with asca satisfy this restriction , and we therefore focus most of our attention on these particular data sets ( though we present detailed results for all 22 sets ) .",
    "all the results given in this subsection assume the nominal values of the optically - determined input parameters given in ",
    "4.2 : @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 kpc ( see  4.2 ) . in the following ,",
    "we show the results of fitting for the spin parameter using three different tail models in turn ",
    "simple pl , thermal comptonization and cutoff pl  in conjunction with our relativistic disk model _ kerrbb2_.    figure  7 summarizes our fit results (  4.2.1 ) obtained using our baseline pl tail model ( mr06 ; rm06 ) .",
    "the spin parameter is shown plotted versus the eddington - scaled luminosity @xmath76 .",
    "the results for all 20 _ rxte _ and 2 _ asca _ observations ( table  1 ) are included in this figure .",
    "the results are shown for two value of the viscosity parameter , @xmath77 and @xmath87 .",
    "all of the analyses reported herein were computed for both values of @xmath1 ; however , for low luminosities ( @xmath135 ) , which are strongly favored in this work ( see  6.1 and the appendix ) , the spin estimates are quite insensitive to the value of @xmath1 ( e.g. , fig .",
    "7 ) , and we therefore generally show results for only @xmath77 .",
    "error bars are included in figure  7 , although they are generally too small to be apparent .",
    "the principal result of this paper is captured in the set of six lowest - luminosity data points ( 5 _ rxte _ and 1 _ asca _ ) in figure  7 , namely that the spin - parameter estimate is very nearly unity for @xmath135 . for the group of four data points at intermediate luminosities , @xmath136 ,",
    "the estimated value of the spin parameter is somewhat depressed , especially for @xmath87 . at high luminosities , @xmath137 ,",
    "the spin estimate is severely depressed and seen to decrease significantly with increasing @xmath76 .",
    "as we discuss in  6.1 and the appendix , there are good reasons to focus only on those data that correspond to @xmath138 .",
    "we thus conclude that grs1915 has a spin parameter close to the maximal kerr value of @xmath139 .",
    "we now consider the effects of replacing the simple pl model for the tail component of emission with a thermal comptonization model , _ comptt_. as explained in  4.2.2 , we considered this model because we had reservations about the behavior of the simple pl model at low energies",
    ". additionally , a comptonization model is more physically motivated and offers a point of comparison with other studies of spin that exclusively use a supplementary comptonization model ( e.g. , middleton et al .  2006 , d06 ) .",
    "the fitted parameters of this model are displayed in figure  8 . as discussed in  4.2.2",
    ", in fitting the data using this component , we fixed the thermal temperature of the soft seed photons at three different trial temperatures  @xmath140 = 1.5 , 2.0 and 2.5 kev  where the central value was determined from our nonrelativistic analysis (  4.1 ; fig .  1 ) .",
    "figure  8 shows @xmath70 versus @xmath76 for the three values of @xmath140 where it is immediately obvious that the results obtained using _ comptt _ do not depend on the temperature of the seed photons over the range considered .",
    "error bars are suppressed , but in all cases their extent is less than the height of the plotting symbols . the results , which are shown for @xmath77 , can be seen to be nearly identical to the results obtained using the pl component for @xmath77 ( fig .  7 ) .",
    "again , for @xmath135 we find that @xmath141 and for intermediate luminosities the spin is slightly depressed ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "as before , the spin drops very significantly at high luminosities ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "next , we consider the results for the cutoff pl model which , like the thermal comptonization model , contributes negligibly to the flux at low energies . relative to the comptonization model , its chief advantage is its greater simplicity , and its disadvantage is its lack of physical motivation (  4.2 ) . the results are summarized in figure  9 for @xmath143 and for the three values of the break energy mentioned in  4.2.2 .",
    "the error bars , which do not exceed the size of the plotting symbols , are suppressed . as shown in figure  9 ,",
    "the results are essentially independent of the choice of cutoff energy .",
    "furthermore , the results for the cutoff pl model at both low and intermediate luminosities are nearly identical to the results obtained with the thermal comptonization model ( fig .  8) and with the simple pl model for @xmath77 ( fig .  7 ) .",
    "finally , in figure  10 we show superposed the results obtained using all three tail models for @xmath77 .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates the robustness of our principal result , namely , that the very high spin of grs1915 does not depend in any significant way on the model used to resolve the relativistic disk component from the faint , adulterating non - disk component . furthermore ,",
    "in  4.2 we have demonstrated that the minor fitting components , the gaussian line and the smedge , operate the same in all the fits and are therefore incidental to the results that we have obtained for the spin parameter ( figs .",
    "710 ) .      under the assumption of an intrinsically symmetric jet ejection , fender et al .",
    "( 1999 ) place an upper limit on the distance to grs  1915 + 105 of @xmath144 kpc .",
    "further , fender et al .",
    "treat as realistic only distances that are in the range 912 kpc , as indicated by the entries in their table  2 .",
    "we follow their lead .",
    "as shown in their table , the kinematic jet model associates with each distance a unique value of the jet inclination ( e.g. , adopting the merlin values , @xmath145 kpc corresponds to @xmath133 ) , which we take as the spin axis of the bh and the accretion disk (  4.2 ) . in turn , each value of @xmath33 is associated with a definite value of the bh mass via the dynamical results for grs1915 ( greiner et al .",
    "2001 ; harlaftis & greiner 2004 ) .",
    "thus , we have a correlated triplet of numbers @xmath80 , @xmath33 and @xmath6 , which are given in table  2 for five values of @xmath80 . in figure  11@xmath146",

    "the cases @xmath147  kpc are not shown because these values drive @xmath70 toward higher values and we are interested here in highlighting the lowest values of @xmath70 . furthermore , as discussed in  6.4 , our fit results indicate that the distance to grs1915 is unlikely to be less than 910 kpc . in figure  11@xmath146 and table 2 , we also include @xmath148  kpc because this extreme distance was adopted by middleton et al .",

    "the effects on the spin due to this uncertainty in the mass are shown in figure  11@xmath151 . as indicated in the figure",
    ", the smallest mass , @xmath152 , gives the lowest values of spin .",
    "limiting our consideration to @xmath90 (  6.1 , appendix ) , figure  11@xmath153 shows that for most allowable distances and masses the spin parameter is nearly unity ( see  5.5 ) . finally , on a separate and incidental matter , we note that our _ rxte _ results are also insensitive to our adopted value of @xmath43 over the full range indicated (  4 ) because the absorbing column is already @xmath154% transmitting at the pca s detector threshold energy of 3 kev .",
    "for the nominal 11 kpc distance that we adopt (  5.2 ) , middleton et al.(2006 ) report a single , moderate value of the spin parameter of @xmath155 ( or @xmath12 for their adopted distance of 12.5 kpc ) .",
    "as we make clear in  5.5 , the m06 value of @xmath156 is very much less than the value we find : @xmath157 .",
    "m06 and we used precisely the same publicly - available relativistic accretion disk models ( i.e. , _ kerrbb _ and _ bhspec _ ) . the key difference between the two studies is in the methodology of data selection .",
    "m06 used a quite different approach that yielded a restricted data sample comprised solely of high - luminosity observations .",
    "as we conclude below , our results are in fact in reasonable agreement with middleton et al . in this high - luminosity regime , which we argue is unreliable for the determination of spin (  6.1 , appendix ) .    both m06 and we agree completely on the necessity of selecting spectra that minimize the nonthermal component and that are dominated by disk emission .",
    "however , m06 s methodologies for selecting such spectra were quite different from ours (  2 ) .",
    "one difference is that m06 based their initial selection on the state classifications defined by belloni et al .",
    "2000 ( see also belloni et al .  1997 , and belloni 2004 ) , which were devised primarily to study disk - jet coupling via a unified model of x - ray states and radio jets .",
    "we , on the other hand , used quantitative state definitions that are centered on physical models of x - ray states ( mr05 ; mr06 ) .",
    "these latter state definitions have been applied more widely to many bh binaries including groj  165540 , 4u  154347 , xte  j1550564 , h  1743322 , xte  j1859 + 226 , and gx  3394 ( mr05 ; mr06 ) .",
    "a second difference is that we screened all the available data and identified 22 observations that are strictly thermal - state data .",
    "this yielded a total of 89 ks of _ rxte _ data and 13 ks of _ asca _ data ( table  1 ) compared with the much smaller collection of data considered by m06 .",
    "it is this larger data sample that allowed us to identify several crucial observations at low luminosities ( @xmath90 ) that are completely absent in m06 s data sample .    in the end",
    ", m06 fitted jointly three representative 16-s observations in order to determine a single spin estimate with the nominal value of @xmath158 ( for @xmath145  kpc ) .",
    "this single spin value and the three corresponding luminosities are indicated in figure  12 by the three filled triangles , which are connected by a solid line .",
    "as shown , these three luminosities range from @xmath159 .",
    "note that mr06 s low value of spin , @xmath160 , is in reasonable accord with the value of @xmath161 that we find ( fig .",
    "12 ) for a luminosity of @xmath162% of @xmath163 using the _ comptt _ model , which is analogous to the _ thcomp _ tail model that m06 used .",
    "furthermore , their somewhat lower spin value , which is an average over a wide range of luminosity , may be largely due to the inclusion of an observation at super - eddington luminosity ( @xmath164 ; fig .",
    "note also that even their mid - luminosity observation with @xmath165 ( fig .",

    "in fact , all three 16-second observations of m06 correspond to @xmath166 and are thus in a regime where a number of the physical assumptions which underly the spectral models are likely to break down .",
    "all of our results include the self - irradiation of the disk as a result of light deflection ( assuming that the disk is infinitely thin , see li et al .",
    "2005 ) , which we refer to as returning radiation .",
    "the effects on our results of turning off the returning radiation ( rflag = 0 ) is shown in figure 13 .",
    "as indicated in the figure , the returning radiation boosts the luminosity of the disk by several percent , but has no significant effect on the spin parameter . the returning radiation feature is not included in _ bhspec _ , the relativistic disk model we used to compute tables of the spectral hardening factor , which were incorporated into _ kerrbb _ via a subroutine to create _ kerrbb2 _ (  4.2 ) . both",
    "_ kerrbb2 _ and _ bhspec _ can be used directly to determine the principal fit parameters @xmath70 and .",

    "for the purposes of this comparison only , we switched the returning radiation off for _ kerrbb2 _ ( rflag = 0 ) .",
    "we found that the two models gave very comparable results for @xmath70 versus @xmath76 .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume that there is no torque acting at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "this assumption is in agreement with the classic and current literature on thin - disk accretion , which advocates the use of a zero - torque boundary condition ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov & thorne 1973 ; afshordi & paczyski 2003 ; li 2003 ) .",

    "the implications of the extreme spin of grs1915 are not immediately apparent if one considers the parameter @xmath70 alone .",
    "therefore it is instructive to consider such related dimensionless parameters as the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) @xmath182 , the binding energy per unit mass at the isco @xmath183 , and the keplerian frequency at the isco @xmath184 , which are all monotonic functions of @xmath70 ( e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1984 ) .",
    "these three quantities are defined and plotted versus @xmath70 in figure  15 , which also shows for the four bhs in question the values of these quantities for our nominal estimates of spin . in this approximate comparison ,",
    "note that both the nominal keplerian frequency and the binding energy at the isco for gro  j165540 and 4u  154347 are only half the values indicated for grs1915 .",
    "there are four avenues for measuring spin  continuum fitting , high - frequency qpos , the fe k line , and polarimetry ( rm06 ) . because spin is such a critical parameter it is important to attempt to measure it by as many of these methods as possible , as this will provide arguably the best possible check on our results .",
    "the best current method , continuum fitting , has the drawback that its application requires accurate estimates of bh mass @xmath6 , disk inclination @xmath33 , and distance @xmath80 .",
    "in contrast , observations of hfqpos require knowledge of only @xmath6 to provide a spin estimate , and once the correct model is known this method is likely to offer the most reliable measurements of spin . presently , however , the leading model of hfqpos , which was initially proposed by abramowicz & kluziak ( 2001 ) , does not provide a useful constraint on @xmath70 for grs1915 because of the wide range of possible resonances and the sizable uncertainty in the bh mass ( trk et al.2005 ) .",

    "do not even require @xmath6 , although knowledge of @xmath33 is useful in order to avoid having to include that parameter in the fit .",
    "however , there are serious sources of uncertainty in the model , including the placement of the continuum , the model of the fluorescing source , and the ionization state of the disk ( reynolds & nowak 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the case of grs1915 , the line is seldom seen and has provided poor constraints on the models , and no estimate of spin has been given ( martocchia et al .  2002 , 2004 ;",
    "miller et al .  2004 ) .",
    "polarimetry appears promising because the polarization features of bh disk radiation can be affected strongly by gr effects ( lightman & shapiro 1976 ; connors et al .",
    "1980 ; doviak et al .  2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , however , there have been no such observations of bhbs , and there are no mission opportunities on the horizon . in short ,",
    "the hfqpo and fe - line methods are not well enough developed to provide dependable results , and the required polarimetry data are not available , whereas the continuum method , despite its limitations , is already delivering results .    the methodology of the continuum - fitting approach is straightforward and transparent .",
    "its foundation is ( 1 ) the simplicity of the rigorously defined thermal state (  1 &  2 ) , which matches very closely the predictions of the classic thin disk models (  1 ) , and ( 2 ) the vast amount of x - ray spectral data contained in the nasa / gsfc heasarc archives for missions ranging from _ ginga _ and _ rxte _ to _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_.    in the thin disk model , there is an axisymmetric radiatively - efficient accretion flow in which , for a given bh mass @xmath6 , mass accretion rate @xmath186 and bh spin parameter @xmath70 , one can calculate very accurately the total luminosity of the disk , @xmath187 .",
    "the parameter @xmath183 , which measures the radiative efficiency of the disk , is a function only of @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "we can also calculate precisely the local radiative flux @xmath188 emitted at radius @xmath189 by each surface of the disk .",
    "moreover , the accreting gas is optically thick , and the emission is thermal and blackbody - like , making it straightforward to compute the spectrum of the emission .",
    "most importantly , the inner edge of a thin disk is located very close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the bh spacetime , whose radius @xmath190 ( in gravitational units ) is a function only of the spin of the bh : @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "thus , if one measures the radius of the disk inner edge , and if one also has an estimate of the mass @xmath6 of the bh , then one can immediately obtain @xmath70 .",
    "this is the principle behind our method of estimating bh spin , which was first described by zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "there is one principal difficulty in applying this method . at the high disk temperatures typically found in bhb disks (  @xmath193  k ) , the spectral hardening factor @xmath71 (  4.2 ) is expected to deviate substantially from unity .",
    "it is therefore important to have a reliable estimate of @xmath71 . until recently ,",
    "the only estimate available was that from shimura & takahara ( 1995 ) , whose seminal but limited study was rather approximate . within the last year , d05 along with davis & hubeny ( 2006 ) have computed more accurate disk atmosphere models including metal opacities and have obtained reliable estimates of @xmath71 as a function of the disk luminosity and inclination .",
    "the use of a rigorous and modern estimate of @xmath71 is absolutely essential for the successful application of this method of estimating bh spin , and it is only now that such an estimate has become available .",
    "nevertheless , even at the lower luminosities we favor (  6.1 ) , the vertical structure of real magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) disks may differ in detail from our models ( see  3 of d06 for details ) .",
    "however , preliminary investigations which incorporate the results of mhd simulations suggest only small changes ( @xmath194% ) .      in s06",
    ", we argued that the method employed in that paper as well as the present paper to estimate bh spin is most reliable at low disk luminosities .",
    "the argument has been amplified by d06 ( see their  3.1 ) .",
    "the main reason to distrust high luminosity data is that the disk is likely to be vertically thick , whereas the model explicitly assumes a thin disk .",
    "the detailed general relativistic ray tracing used in _ kerrbb _ , _",
    "kerrbb2 _ and _ bhspec _ assumes a razor - thin disk whose surface is exactly at @xmath195 .",
    "so long as the disk thickness @xmath196 is much less than the local disk radius @xmath189 , we expect only small errors to result from the idealized geometry assumed in the model . however , as @xmath197 increases we expect various geometrical effects to creep in .",
    "although it is hard to be quantitative , it is reasonable to think that the errors will become non - negligible once @xmath198 .",
    "another important assumption in the models is that there is no torque applied at the inner edge of the disk (  5.4 ) .",
    "krolik ( 1999 ) and gammie ( 1999 ) argued that magnetic fields would be amplified near the inner edge of the disk , where the gas begins to free - fall into the bh , and that these fields would apply a torque on the disk .",
    "the torque will enhance the energy dissipation near the isco and lead to a modification in the profile of the disk flux @xmath199 .",
    "if this effect is strong enough it will introduce a large error in the bh spin estimate .",
    "interestingly , li ( 2004 ) finds that , in some cases , a strong magnetic field connecting the disk and the bh may actually move the inner edge of the disk out and cause a reduction in the luminosity .",
    "afshordi & paczyski ( 2003 ) suggested that the torques are likely to scale as some positive power of @xmath197 and therefore will be unimportant in very thin disks ( see their figs .",
    "17 and 18 ) .",
    "this topic is still under debate and is likely to be settled only with detailed models .    to make progress on this question",
    ", one approach is to work with the viscous hydrodynamic disk equations , including pressure and radial dynamics ( as in narayan , kato & honma 1997 and afshordi & paczyski 2003 ) , and to calculate the viscous stress at the sonic radius and the rate of viscous energy dissipation as a function of radius for various disk thicknesses . within the limitations of the @xmath1-viscosity prescription",
    ", this will provide a clean answer to whether or not the torque at the inner edge is important for thin disks .",
    "our preliminary analysis appears to support afshordi & paczyski s ( 2003 ) assertion that the torque is unimportant for thin disks .",
    "a more detailed , and ultimately more rigorous , approach is to carry out 3d numerical mhd simulations of realistic thin disks , including radiative cooling to keep the disk thin .",
    "the only work to date involves non - radiative thick disks and is not yet very useful .",
    "regardless of the current uncertainty over the magnitude of the torque at the disk inner edge , we note that at low luminosities ( when the disk is thin , see below ) the effects on the spin parameter of even a sizable torque is quite small ( see   5.4 ) .",
    "another effect that becomes important when the disk is vertically thick is radial advection of energy ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 , 1995 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the more energy advection there is in the disk , the less energy is radiated to infinity , and the larger is the deviation of @xmath199 from the idealized thin disk profile assumed in the model .",
    "thus , it is safest to work with disks that have negligible radial advection , i.e. , disks with @xmath200 .",
    "let us now estimate the disk thickness @xmath196 and the ratio @xmath197 for a newtonian thin accretion disk .",
    "the flux emitted by a thin accretion disk around a bh with zero torque at the inner edge is given by ( e.g. , frank et al .",
    "2002 ) @xmath201,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the mass of the bh , @xmath186 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath189 is the cylindrical radius , and @xmath14 is the radius of the inner edge of the disk . let us define the eddington mass accretion rate by equating the disk luminosity to the eddington luminosity , @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the opacity of the gas .",
    "correspondingly , let us define the eddington - scaled mass accretion rate by @xmath204 we now rewrite the disk flux @xmath199 in terms of @xmath205 and calculate the vertical acceleration due to radiation pressure , @xmath206.\\ ] ] in equilibrium , the radiative acceleration must be balanced by the vertical component of gravity , which for simplicity we can write as @xmath207 .",
    "we then find @xmath208 .",
    "\\label{hoverr}\\ ] ] figure 16 shows @xmath197 as a function of @xmath189 for various choices of the accretion rate : from below , @xmath209 , 0.2 , ... , 1.2 .",
    "if we wish to have @xmath210 at all @xmath189 , then we see that we are limited to @xmath211 , i.e. , to eddington - scaled disk luminosities @xmath212 .",
    "the appendix describes a more accurate estimate of the disk height that is calculated for a general relativistic disk around a kerr bh .",
    "results are shown in figure  17 . according to that analysis , in order to have @xmath213 at all radii , we must restrict our attention to luminosities @xmath135 . this is the limit we employ throughout the paper .",
    "if we consider the exact expression for the newtonian vertical gravity @xmath214 rather than the approximation @xmath215 , then we find that the maximum value of the vertical gravitational acceleration ( which is achieved at @xmath216 ) is @xmath217 for any accretion rate greater than about 85% of eddington , or @xmath218 , one finds that some parts of the disk produce too much radiation to be balanced even by the maximum vertical gravity @xmath219 .",
    "radiation pressure will then cause material to be blown away from the disk .",
    "this critical luminosity is clearly related to the eddington limit ; the slightly different numerical value , i.e. , 85% instead of 100% of the canonical eddington limit , is the result of the different geometry of a disk compared to the spherical geometry that one usually considers .",
    "( see nityananda & narayan 1982 for a discussion of geometry effects on the eddington limit . )",
    "we showed in   5",
    "that , by focusing on data corresponding to @xmath220 , we obtain very consistent results for the spin parameter of grs1915 , independent of the details of the spectral model we employ .",
    "we also found that the results begin to deviate as we go to higher luminosities , suggesting that as the disk thickens one or more of the effects described in this subsection becomes important .",
    "it is interesting that the deviations are not random but very systematic , e.g. , the estimate of @xmath70 decreases smoothly and monotonically as @xmath221 increases .",
    "this signature could conceivably be used to identify which of our assumptions breaks down as the luminosity increases .",
    "detailed viscous disk models with varying disk thickness might be able to shed some light on this issue .",
    "king and kolb ( 1999 ) provide a global evolutionary and observational argument that neither significant spinup nor spindown is likely to occur during the lifetime of any bh binary and hence that bh primaries essentially retain the spin rates that they had at birth . in the particular case of 4u  154347 , based on its present accretion rate and modest age ( @xmath222  gyr )",
    ", we argued that the spin of its bh (  5.7 ) is likewise chiefly natal ( s06 ) .",
    "the fast spin reported herein for grs1915 , @xmath179 , is almost certainly a natal spin because the alternative , achieving this spin gradually via accretion torques , would require almost doubling the mass of the bh ( see below ) .",
    "such a large increment in bh mass is unlikely to have occurred during the evolution of grs1915 or any bh binary simply because systems with initially low- or moderate - mass secondaries ( i.e. , @xmath223 a few ) obviously can not supply the required mass , and systems with high - mass secondaries have lifetimes that are too short to effect the required mass transfer .",
    "we now consider the exceptional case of grs1915 in more detail .",
    "grs1915 presently has a low - mass secondary , @xmath224  ( harliftis & greiner 2004 ) and the most massive primary and longest period of any bh binary (  1 ) .",
    "there is a great deal of uncertainty in evolutionary models for grs1915 and for all bh binaries .",
    "the specific evolutionary model of belczynski & bulik ( 2002 ) for grs1915 argues for a small transfer of mass to the primary and negligible spin up , which is in agreement with most generic models ( e.g. , king & kolb 1999 ) .",
    "an evolutionary model of grs1915 that links this source to the ultraluminous x - ray sources implies the most extreme mass transfer and spin up ( podsiadlowski et al .",
    "these authors argue that the initial secondary mass could have been as high as 6  and the bh primary could have accreted as much as @xmath225  ( see also lee et al .",
    "even for this extreme scenario , the predicted spin up due to accretion torques is modest .",
    "based on a precise calculation that ignores returning radiation (  5.5 ) , we find that the transfer of 4  onto a 10  natal black hole with zero initial spin yields a final spin of only @xmath226 , which is far less than our limit of @xmath179 (  5.5 , fig .",
    "15 ) . likewise , to achieve a final spin of @xmath179 would require an initial spin of @xmath227 .",
    "furthermore , if one includes the effects of returning radiation , then the accretion is less efficient in spinning up the hole and a somewhat larger natal spin is required . again neglecting returning radiation , a",
    "10  bh that is spun up by accretion torques from @xmath228 to @xmath229 would have a final mass of 19.3 ; since some of the rest mass energy is radiated away , the total rest mass accreted in such a spin up event would be 10.7 .",
    "we thus conclude that the extreme spin of grs1915 was likely imparted to the bh primary during the process of its formation .",
    "the generation of large spins is central to grb models .",
    "natal spins of @xmath156 , in agreement with our observations , were predicted for gro  j165540 and 4u  154347 by lee et al .",
    "the extreme spin of grs1915 , @xmath179 , is an expected consequence of collapsar models (  6.3 ) .",
    "the properties of a bh are completely defined by specifying just two parameters , its mass @xmath6 and its dimensionless spin parameter @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , a bh s mass simply supplies a physical scale , whereas its spin fundamentally changes the geometry of space - time .",
    "accordingly , in order to model the ways in which an accreting bh can interact with its environment , one must know its spin .",
    "for example , consider one of the most intriguing unsolved problems in astrophysics , namely , the connection between bh spin and relativistic jets that are commonly observed for both supermassive and stellar - mass bhs and that are so prominent in the case of grs1915 ( e.g. , mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) .",
    "for many years , scientists have speculated that these jets are powered by bh spin via a penrose - like process associated with magnetic fields ( e.g. , blandford & znajek 1977 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ; meier 2003 ; mckinney & gammie 2004 ) .",
    "however , these ideas will remain mere speculation until sufficient data on bh spins have been amassed and the models can be tested and confirmed .",
    "this provides strong motivation for measuring the spins of accreting bhs .    the strong evidence for natal spins  particularly in the case of grs1915(6.2 )",
    " is obviously of major significance in building core - collapse models for sn and grbs ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) .",
    "for example , one of the greatest uncertainties in grb modeling is whether one can arrive at the core collapse stage with sufficient angular momentum to make a disk around a bh .",
    "the spins of gro  j165540 and 4u  154347  and especially grs1915  provide strong evidence for the high natal rotation rates of bhs and thus provide strong support for the collapsar model of `` long - soft '' grbs .",
    "the continuing development of gravitational wave astronomy is central to the exploration of bhs , and knowledge of bh spin is fundamentally important to this effort . to detect the faint coalescence signal for two inspiralling bhs",
    ", one must compute the expected waveform and use it to filter the data .",
    "our spin estimates for gro  j1655 - 40 and 4u  154347 ( r06 ) motivated the first such waveform computation that includes the effects of spin ( campanelli et al .",
    "2006 ) , and our results reported here for grs1915 present a further challenge to the waveform modelers .",
    "as mentioned in  5.2 , our fit results for the five low - luminosity observations ( @xmath138 ; see  4.2.1 , table  1 ) indicate that the distance to grs1915 is unlikely to be less than about 910  kpc .",
    "this result is based on the abrupt and dramatic rise in @xmath230 that occurs for lesser distances . for the nominal 14.0  value of bh mass and @xmath80 = 11.0 , 10.5 , 10.0 , 9.5 and 9.0  kpc , the respective values of @xmath231 for each low - luminosity observation are 0.6 , 0.6 , 2.6 , 13.3 , 43.4 ( obs .",

'' for each assumed value of mass , and hence inclination and distance ( see  5.2 ) , the limiting value plotted in figure 18@xmath146 is an average result for the five low - luminosity points at a 99% level of confidence ( @xmath234@xmath230 = 6.6 ) .",

    "we believe that it should be possible to obtain a model - independent vlba parallax distance that is precise to @xmath236% and to reduce the uncertainty by a factor of two in the radial velocity amplitude @xmath53 of the secondary , which would significantly improve the accuracy of the mass function .",
    "such improvements in the observational constraints will provide a powerful test of the spin and jet models for grs1915 .",
    "using a rigorous and quantitative definition of the thermal state of a black hole binary (  2 ) , we screened all the available _ rxte _  pca and _ asca _ gis data and identified a total of 22 observations of grs  1915 + 105 that are free of qpos and strong timing noise and for which the thermal disk component of emission contributes @xmath237  % of the total 220  kev flux .",
    "we then fitted the 22 disk - dominated spectra using principally a model of a thin accretion disk in the kerr metric that includes all relativistic effects plus an advanced treatment of the spectral hardening factor @xmath71 (  4.2 ) .",
    "the spectral fitting of the 22 spectra was repeated a number of times using three different models for the nonthermal tail component of emission and two different values of the viscosity parameter (  4 ) .",
    "the results for the key relativistic parameters  the spin @xmath70 and the mass accretion rate   were shown to be quite independent of any details of the analysis and insensitive to the uncertainties in the independently - determined input parameters , namely , the mass , inclination and distance of the black hole (  5 ) .    on theoretical grounds , we argue that the spin parameter can be determined most reliably at lower luminosities (  6.1 , appendix ) .",
    "our relativistic disk model assumes a disk that is thin and torque - free at its inner edge .",
    "higher luminosities are problematic because they likely lead to disk thickening and nonzero torques near the isco . based on theoretical arguments ,",
    "we propose a limit on the disk thickness and a corresponding limit on the disk luminosity , @xmath90 , below which one can obtain reliable estimates of the spin parameter .",
    "adopting this criterion , we obtain our principal conclusion : grs  1915 + 105 is a rapidly - rotating bh with a lower limit on its spin parameter of @xmath131 . finally , we propose an observational test of our spin model .    we thank keith arnaud for help in implementing models in xspec and the following people for helpful discussions and encouragement : stan woosley , alexandar heger , gerry brown , vicky kalogera , cole miller , and paul gorenstein .",

    ", we can calculate the relative acceleration , @xmath256 where @xmath257    for a disk that is radiation - dominated ( at least at the photosphere ) , the equilibrium in the vertical direction is determined by @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the radiation flux density of the disk ( measured by an observer corotating with the disk ) and @xmath203 is the disk opacity .",

    "then , equation  ( [ hr0 ] ) can be recast into @xmath274 it can be shown that this expression for @xmath197 simplifies to equation  ( [ hoverr ] ) in the newtonian limit .",

    "it turns out that for any given value of @xmath278 , the maximum value of @xmath197 is very insensitive to variation in @xmath70 ( though the radius at which this maximum is reached varies by a large factor ) .",

    "notice how the two sets of curves agree very closely as far as their maxima are concerned .",
