    "next we use the information provided by the previous lemma to reduce the situation at hand to constant coefficients .",
    "we prove a general statement to this effect :    [ l.puiglem3 ] let @xmath9 be diophantine and suppose @xmath232 is a real - analytic map , with analytic extension to the strip @xmath233 for some @xmath234 .",
    "assume that there is a non - vanishing real - analytic map @xmath235 with analytic extension to the same strip @xmath233 such that @xmath236 then , there are a real number @xmath237 and a real - analytic map @xmath238 with analytic extension to the strip @xmath239 such that with @xmath240 we have @xmath241    since @xmath242 does not vanish ,",
    "@xmath243 is strictly positive and hence we can define @xmath244 for @xmath26 .",
    "we have @xmath245 and hence @xmath246 with @xmath247 where @xmath248 is analytic . indeed , by the first column of @xmath249 is determined and",
    "then its @xmath250 entry must be one since @xmath251 .",
    "now let @xmath252 and define the matrix @xmath253 as in .",
    "we claim that we can find @xmath254 analytic ( with analytic extension to a strip ) such that @xmath255 indeed , expand both sides of the hypothetical identity in fourier series : @xmath256 since we have @xmath257 , the @xmath258 terms disappear on both sides and hence all we need to do is to require @xmath259 in other words , if we set @xmath260 and @xmath261 then @xmath262 satisfies . since @xmath263 has an analytic extension to a strip , the coefficients @xmath264 decay exponentially . on the other hand ,",
    "the diophantine condition which @xmath3 satisfies ensures that the coefficients @xmath265 decay exponentially as well and hence @xmath266 is real - analytic with an extension to the same open strip .    setting @xmath267 and using",
    ", we find @xmath268 for every @xmath26 .",
    "thus , setting @xmath269 , we obtain .",
    "consider first a coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "we have seen above that aubry duality maps the energy @xmath62 to the dual energy @xmath77",
    ". we will establish below that if @xmath62 is an eigenvalue of @xmath270 , then the dual energy @xmath77 is an endpoint of a gap of the spectrum of @xmath271 .",
    "since we already know that for diophantine @xmath3 , @xmath270 has pure point spectrum , we can consider energies belonging to the countable dense set of eigenvalues .",
    "it then follows that the dual energies are all endpoints of gaps and hence the gaps are dense because the spectra are just related by uniform scaling .",
    "let us implement this strategy .",
    "consider an eigenvalue @xmath62 of @xmath270 and a corresponding exponentially decaying eigenfunction .",
    "then , lemma  [ l.puiglem2 ] yields the real - analytic function @xmath90 , which has an analytic extension to a strip , and a quasi - periodic solution of the dual difference equation at the dual energy . using this as input to lemma  [ l.puiglem3 ]",
    ", we then obtain that @xmath272 may be analytically conjugated via @xmath273 to the constant @xmath274    let us show that @xmath275 .",
    "assume to the contrary @xmath276 .",
    "then , @xmath277 for every @xmath26 and therefore , all solutions of are analytically quasi - periodic !",
    "indeed , @xmath278 that is , @xmath279 and hence @xmath224 with a real - analytic function @xmath225 on @xmath87 . now consider two linearly independent solutions of and associate with them via lemma  [ l.puiglem2 ] the corresponding exponentially decaying solutions of the dual equation .",
    "they must be linearly independent too , which yields the desired contradiction since by constancy of the wronskian there can not be two linearly independent exponentially decaying solutions .",
    "this contradiction shows @xmath275 .",
    "let us now perturb the energy and consider @xmath280 one can show that there is @xmath281 such that @xmath282    since the @xmath62 s in question are dense in @xmath283 , aubry duality shows that the @xmath77 s in question are dense in @xmath284 . by all these energies",
    "are endpoints of gaps of @xmath284 .",
    "thus , @xmath284 does not contain an interval . recall that by general principles , @xmath284 is closed and does not contain isolated points .",
    "consequently , @xmath285 is a cantor set . then , by aubry duality again , @xmath92 is a cantor set , too .",
    "putting everything together , it follows that for every diophantine @xmath3 and every @xmath286 , @xmath45 is a cantor set .",
    "so far we have shown the main theorems , that is , an identification of the almost sure spectral type and the cantor structure of the spectrum , for diophantine frequencies @xmath3 and non - critical coupling constants @xmath28 . in this final section",
    "we discuss the case of liouville frequencies in more depth .",
    "they have already been considered when we showed that there are never any eigenvalues and hence the expected localization at super - critical coupling fails in these cases .    as a consequence of this non - result",
    ", we can not deduce using aubry duality that the spectrum at sub - critical coupling is almost surely purely absolutely continuous nor that it is a cantor set .",
    "thus , a different approach is required to prove these statements , which turn out to be indeed true .",
    "since liouville numbers are very well approximated by rational numbers , it is natural to try and prove the expected statements by periodic approximation",
    ". this is also the philosophy that is implemented with the help of gordon s lemma to prove the absence of eigenvalues .",
    "periodic operators always have purely absolutely continuous spectrum , so one needs a method to push this through to the quasi - periodic limit .",
    "moreover , the spectra of periodic operators have many gaps and a suitable continuity statement for spectra could feasibly identify a dense set of gaps in the spectrum of the quasi - periodic operator if the rate of approximation is sufficiently good .",
    "we will only make these results plausible by describing the main ideas and tools used in the proofs . as pointed out above",
    ", it will be essential to obtain a good understanding of the periodic approximants to @xmath14 , which arise when @xmath3 is replaced by a rational number close to it .",
    "so , from now on , we will drop the requirement that @xmath3 is irrational and instead consider @xmath14 for @xmath8 and @xmath287 .",
    "given such @xmath28 and @xmath3 , we define @xmath288 for irrational @xmath3 , this definition coincides with the one we had previously , since the spectrum of @xmath14 is @xmath5-independent in this case .",
    "we first discuss cantor spectrum . by aubry duality",
    ", it suffices to consider @xmath289 .",
    "this will sometimes be relevant below .",
    "the first question we address is the continuity of @xmath45 as a function of @xmath3 .      here",
    ", @xmath292 denotes the hausdorff distance between @xmath45 and @xmath293 .",
    "the proof uses test functions with a linear cut - off .",
    "this continuity result shows that any gap of @xmath294 corresponds to a gap of @xmath45 if its length is larger than @xmath295 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hof ] shows the sets @xmath296 for @xmath297 with @xmath298 .",
    "this plot , which has a beautiful self - similar structure , is known as the _ hofstadter butterfly_.",
    "this produces many gaps in @xmath45 when @xmath3 is liouville .",
    "indeed , choose a sequence @xmath305 with @xmath306 coprime and @xmath307 .",
    "then , for @xmath118 large enough , there are at least @xmath308 many gaps in @xmath45 .",
    "it remains to show that these gaps are dense . to this end",
    ", the following observation does the job .",
    "let us now discuss how to prove purely absolutely continuous spectrum at sub - critical coupling for liouville frequencies .",
    "the spectral type is much less robust under perturbations than , for example , the spectrum .",
    "simple approximation of @xmath14 by @xmath310 does not look promising at first .",
    "it turns out that robustness improves if one averages over @xmath5 !",
    "recall that the spectral measure @xmath311 associated with @xmath14 and the state @xmath312 is the borel probability measure with the property that @xmath313 for all bounded , borel measurable functions @xmath225 .",
    "the density of states measure @xmath314 is formally given by @xmath315 more precisely , it is the borel probability measure that satisfies @xmath316 for all bounded , borel measurable functions @xmath225 .",
    "consider the lebesgue decomposition of these measures .",
    "denote the radon - nikodym derivative of the absolutely continuous component of @xmath311 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath314 ) by @xmath317 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath318 ) .        since the periodic approximants have purely absolutely continuous spectrum , the associated density of states measures are absolutely continuous so we want to take a limit of these quantities as @xmath322 .",
    "what about the lyapunov exponents ?",
    "it is well known that the lyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum in the periodic case . for the almost mathieu operator",
    ", we have the following result :      this shows that for @xmath289 , the lyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum and we can attempt to apply kotani s theorem in this coupling regime .",
    "we mention in passing that for @xmath11 , the spectrum has zero lebesgue measure and hence @xmath314 is purely singular . for @xmath218 , on the other hand , and a liouville @xmath3 it is indeed possible to show that the irrational case is so well approximated by the rational case that @xmath325 .",
    "kotani s theorem then yields the result .",
