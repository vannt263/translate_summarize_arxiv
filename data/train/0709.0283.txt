    "phylogenetic trees have proved an important tool for representing evolutionary relationships . for a set @xmath5 of species ( or , more generally , taxa ) these",
    "are formally defined as leaf - labelled trees whose leaves are bijectively labelled by the elements of @xmath5 .",
    "advances in dna sequencing have resulted in ever more data on which such trees may be based .",
    "computational limitations however combined with the need to understand species evolution have left biologists with the following fundamental problem which we will refer to as _ amalgamation problem _ : given a collection @xmath0 of phylogenetic trees , how can these trees be amalgamated into an overall parental structure that preserves the phylogenetic relationships supported by the trees in @xmath0 ?",
    "the hope is that such a structure might help shed light on the evolution of the underlying genomes ( and thus the species ) .    in the ideal case",
    "that all trees in @xmath0 support the same phylogenetic relationships ( as is the case for trees @xmath6 and @xmath7 depicted in fig .",
    "[ pete - trees ] ) this structure is known to be a phylogenetic tree and a supertree method @xcite may be used to reconstruct it . for the above example the outcome @xmath8 of such a method",
    "is @xmath6 with species _ cru _ ( see fig .  [ pete - trees ] for full species names ) attached via a pendant edge to the vertex labelled @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath8 supports the same phylogenetic relationships as @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the following sense : for a finite set @xmath5 , call a bipartition @xmath10 of some subset @xmath11 a _ partial split _ on @xmath5 , or a _ partial ( x)-split _ for short , and denote it by @xmath12 or , equivalently , by @xmath13 where @xmath14 . in particular , call @xmath15 a _ ( full ) split _ of @xmath5 if @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , say that a partial @xmath5-split @xmath17 _ extends _ a partial @xmath5-split @xmath18 if either @xmath19 and @xmath20 or @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "finally , say that a phylogenetic tree @xmath23 _ displays _ a split @xmath17 if @xmath15 is a partial split on the leaf set @xmath24 of @xmath23 induced by deleting an edge of @xmath23 .",
    "then `` supports the same phylogenetic relationships '' means that for every split @xmath15 displayed by @xmath6 or @xmath25 there exists a split on @xmath26 that extends @xmath15 and is displayed by @xmath8 .",
    "due to complex evolutionary mechanisms such as incomplete lineage sorting , recombination ( in the case of viruses ) , or lateral gene transfer ( in case of bacteria ) the trees in @xmath0 may however support not the same but conflicting phylogenetic relationships . a phylogenetic network in the form of a split network ( see @xcite for overviews ) rather than",
    "a phylogenetic tree is therefore the structure of choice if one wishes to simultaneously represent all phylogenetic relationships supported by the trees in @xmath0 .",
    "an example in point is the split network pictured in fig .",
    "[ pete - network ] which appeared as a weighted network in @xcite . with replacing `` edge '' in the definition of displaying by `` band of parallel edges '' and `` @xmath24 '' by `` set of network vertices of degree 1 '' to obtain a definition for when a split network displays a split , it is straight forward to check that the network in fig .",
    "[ pete - network ] displays all splits displayed by the 3 trees pictured in fig .",
    "[ pete - trees ] .",
    "it should be noted that phylogenetic networks such as the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ pete - network ] ( see e.g. @xcite for recently introduced other types of phylogenetic networks ) provide a means to visualize the complexity of a data set and should not be thought of as an explicit model of evolution .",
    "awareness of this complexity does not only allow the exploration of a data set but , as is the case of e.g. hybridization networks @xcite , can also serve as starting point for obtaining an explicit model of evolution ( see @xcite for more on this ) .",

    "[ pete - trees ] ( see that figure for full species names ) .",
    ", width=226,height=151 ]    apart from displaying all splits induced by the 3 trees depicted in fig .  [ pete - trees ] , the network depicted in fig .",
    "[ pete - network ] has a further interesting feature .",
    "it is _ circular_. in other words , if @xmath5 denotes the set of the 7 plant species under consideration , then the elements of @xmath5 can be arranged around a circle @xmath27 so that every split @xmath17 of @xmath5 displayed by the network can be obtained by intersecting @xmath27 with a straight line so that the label set of one of the resulting 2 connected components is @xmath28 and the label set of the other is @xmath29 .",
    "although seemingly a very special type of phylogenetic network , circular phylogenetic networks are a frequently used structure in phylogenetics ( see e.g.@xcite ) as they do not only naturally generalize the concept of a phylogenetic tree but are also guaranteed to be representable in the plane ; a fact that greatly facilitates drawing and thus analyzing them . however , although recently first steps have been made with regards to finding a solution to the amalgamation problem in terms of a phylogenetic network leading to the attractive z - closure @xcite and @xmath2-imputation @xcite approaches , very little is known about a solution of this problem in terms of a circular phylogenetic network .",
    "intrigued by this and motivated by the fact that , from a combinatorial point of view , phylogenetic trees and networks are _ split systems _ ( i.e.collections of full splits ) and that therefore the amalgamation problem boils down to the problem of how to extend partial splits on some set @xmath5 to splits on @xmath5 , we wondered whether closure rules for partial splits could not be of help .",
    "essentially mechanisms for splits enlargement , such rules have proved useful for supertree construction and also underpin the above mentioned @xmath1-closure super - network approach .",
    "as it turns out , this is indeed the case . as an immediate consequence of our main result ( corollary [ cyclosure ] ) ,",
    "we obtain that for a collection of partial splits that can be `` displayed '' by a circular phylogenetic network @xmath30 , the collection of ( full ) splits generated by the closure rules in the centre of this paper is guaranteed to be displayable by @xmath30 and also independent of the order in which the rules are applied .    in a study aimed at shedding light into the origin of eukaryotes , rivera et al .",
    "@xcite put forward the idea of a `` ring of life '' with the eukaryotic genome being the result of a fusion of two diverse procaryotic genomes ( see also @xcite ) . a natural and interesting question in this context is how dependent rivera et al.s ring of life is on the fact that all underpinning trees are on the same taxa set . in the last section of this paper ,",
    "we provide a partial answer by presenting an example of a collection of induced partial trees from which the ring of life can be reconstructed using the @xmath4- and @xmath3-rule .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ closure - rules ] , we first introduce some more terminology and then restate one of meacham s closure rules ( our @xmath4-rule ) and introduce the novel @xmath3-rule . in section  [ relship ] , we study the relationship between the @xmath4- and @xmath3-rule and the closure rule that underpins the aforementioned @xmath1-closure super - network approach . in section  [ properties ] , we introduce the concept of a circular collection of partial splits and show that both the @xmath3- and @xmath4-rule preserve circularity ( proposition  [ circ ] ) . in section  [ spl - sequence ] , we introduce the concept of a split closure and show that for certain collections of partial splits this closure is independent of the order in which the @xmath3-rule and/or @xmath4-rule are / is applied ( theorem  [ split - closure ] ) .",
