    "heavy - ion induced fusion reactions have been studied extensively for more than forty years , especially since the discovery of the sub - barrier enhancement phenomenon @xcite .",
    "coupled - channels descriptions were shown to explain the phenomenon successfully @xcite .",
    "recently , evidence was found for a strong hindrance of the fusion process at extreme sub - barrier energies , an effect for which there is no satisfactory explanation in present model calculations @xcite .",
    "a systematic survey of existing data from the literature shows that there is a regular pattern to the energy dependence for the appearance of fusion hindrance @xcite . for stiff , closed - shell colliding systems ,",
    "a significant maximum in the @xmath3-factor is present as a function of the beam energy .",
    "this maximum signals the onset of sub - barrier hindrance , and the energy , @xmath4 , at which it is located can be described well by an empirical formula @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 . for softer systems , this formula provides an upper limit for the energy at which the @xmath3-factor has its maximum .    fusion hindrance at extreme sub - barrier energies is relevant , not only for understanding the dynamics of reactions between complex systems , but also for astrophysics and for the synthesis of superheavy elements .",
    "the influence of nuclear structure on this hindrance behavior was first studied in a detailed comparison @xcite for the colliding systems : @xmath8ni + @xmath8ni @xcite , @xmath8ni + @xmath9ni @xcite , @xmath8ni + @xmath0ni @xcite , and @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni @xcite , where the systems are arranged in order of decreasing stiffness . for @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni , an open - shell colliding system ,",
    "the measured location in energy of the @xmath3-factor maximum is about @xmath10 lower than the value expected from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] @xcite , while the other systems are more in line with the systematics .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to further investigate the hindrance phenomenon by measuring fusion evaporation for the open - shell system @xmath0ni + @xmath11mo .",
    "compared to @xmath0ni , @xmath11mo is a transitional nucleus with two protons outside the closed proton shell .",
    "two earlier measurements of fusion excitation functions for @xmath0ni + @xmath11mo can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the minimum cross section measured in these two experiments is about 0.4 mb . since the hindrance behavior is expected ( from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] ) to occur at much lower energies , the main aim of the present measurement was an extension of the excitation function into the nb region in order to localize and quantify this hindrance .",
    "the experiment was performed with @xmath0ni beams in the energy range of 196 - 262 mev from the superconducting linear accelerator atlas at argonne national laboratory .",
    "the maximum beam current used was @xmath2 60 pna .",
    "the high melting point of the target material , metallic molybdenum evaporated on a 40@xmath12g/@xmath13 carbon foil , prevented damage to the target by the relatively high beam current .",
    "the target thickness was constant during the experiment , as monitored with si detectors .",
    "thin targets with thicknesses of 8 or 18@xmath12g/@xmath13 were used in order to reduce the correction for target thickness in the energy regime of steep fall - off of the excitation function .",
    "the isotopic abundance of @xmath11mo was 97.42@xmath14 , with the remainder coming from @xmath15mo ( 0.96% ) , @xmath16mo ( 0.28% ) , @xmath17mo ( 0.34% ) , @xmath18mo ( 0.29% ) , @xmath19mo ( 0.18% ) , and @xmath20mo ( 0.53% ) .",
    "the selection of the beam and target combination excluded the possibility of background from fusion reactions coming from beam or target contaminants  @xcite .",
    "two surface - barrier si detectors , located at @xmath21 43@xmath22 with respect to the beam direction , served as monitors .",
    "the absolute cross sections for fusion - evaporation were determined by using elastic scattering measured with the monitors .",
    "the evaporation residues were identified and measured with the fragment mass analyzer ( fma ) @xcite , which has been upgraded with the installation of a split - anode in the first electric - dipole @xcite .",
    "the background , originating mostly from scattered beam , was greatly suppressed after this upgrade . in order to push the cross section measurements to the lowest level ,",
    "a new focal - plane detector with the configuration pgac - tic - pgac - tic - pgac - ic , was used in the experiment . here , the symbols pgac stand for @xmath23-@xmath24 position sensitive parallel grid avalanche counters @xcite , tic for transmission ionization chambers @xcite , and ic for a large volume multi - anode ionization chamber .",
    "the first pgac was mounted at the horizontal ( @xmath23-direction ) focal - plane of the fma .",
    "the @xmath24-focus condition occurs about 70 cm downstream of the focal - plane , which is nearly at the middle of the last ionization chamber .",
    "the three sets of position signals @xmath25 and @xmath26 were measured with the three pgac s .",
    "the flight - times @xmath27 and @xmath28 obtained from pgac@xmath29-pgac@xmath30 and pgac@xmath29-pgac@xmath31 were also recorded .",
    "seven @xmath32 signals were measured with the ionization chambers ( the first four @xmath33-@xmath34 in the two transmission ionization chambers and the last three @xmath35-@xmath36 in the final ionization chamber , ic ) .",
    "another time - of - flight signal , @xmath37 , measured the time difference between the rf - system of the accelerator and the first pgac .",
    "three additional @xmath32 signals from the pgac s were also recorded .",
    "the three pgac s and two tic s operated at a fixed pressure of 3 torr of isobutane .",
    "the last ionization chamber had an adjustable pressure of 22 - 30 torr of isobutane .",
    "there was one 0.13 mg/@xmath13 mylar pressure foil in front of the first pgac , and another one with a thickness of 0.22 mg/@xmath13 located between the third pgac and the last ionization chamber .",
    "this setup allowed for full tracking of each particle detected in the system , and provided very good separation between evaporation residues and background events .",
    "a more detailed description of the new detector system will be published elsewhere @xcite .    for most settings of the fma",
    ", two charge states of the residues were collected simultaneously .",
    "for the energies @xmath38 = 260.5 , 245.8 , 209.1 , 207.1 and 202.2 mev , full charge state distributions were measured , while for most other energies , two fma settings , _",
    "i.e. _ four charge states were recorded . at the four lowest energies ,",
    "only two charge states were measured . from the full charge state distributions ,",
    "charge state fractions were determined for extrapolation to all other energies .",
    "the energy distributions and angular distributions of evaporation residues were calculated with the statistical code pace @xcite .",
    "total angular distributions for fusion - evaporation have been measured in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0ni + @xmath11mo . in order to check the pace code ,",
    "calculations were compared with these experimental angular distributions of ref .",
    "@xcite and good agreement was found as long as the total calculated angular distributions were taken as a weighted sum of the angular distributions of the different masses from our @xmath39 measurements and folded with multiple scattering . whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite rather thick targets were used , the corrections from multiple scattering are small in the present experiment .",
    "the transport efficiencies of the fma were calculated with these angular distributions together with monte carlo simulations , using a modified version of the gios code @xcite .",
    "the large momentum acceptance , @xmath21 10 @xmath14 , and the large angular acceptance , @xmath40 2.3@xmath41 , of the fma result in a high detection efficiency for the residues .",
    "the flight - time @xmath28 between pgac@xmath29 and pgac@xmath31 , together with a @xmath32 signal measured in a counter far behind the focal plane ( e.g. @xmath42 ) , was found to give the best separation of the residues from background events .",
    "two - dimensional plots of @xmath42 vs. @xmath28 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , indicating the excellent separation achieved with these two quantities . down to a cross section level of @xmath2 300",
    "nb , the evaporation residues could be identified on the basis of these two parameters alone .",
    "the events that fall within the expected window for evaporation residues are shown as open circles in fig .",
    "events shown by small points originate from beam particles , scattered from the beam pipe or from the area of the `` beam stop '' at the first split anode . the events in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a correspond to a cross section of 242 nb obtained in a 12 hours run .",
    "a two - dimensional plot of @xmath35 vs. @xmath28 , corresponding to the same events is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a . at this",
    "energy evaporation residues ( open circles ) are again well separated from background events ( small points ) . at the lowest energy , @xmath43=196.0 mev",
    ", we find that 23 events fall within the expected evaporation residue window as illustrated in fig .",
    "most of these events are suspiciously close to an intense band of scattered beam particles which borders the fusion evaporation residue window . by examining the @xmath35 vs. @xmath28 spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , it is evident that only one of these events falls within the expected range of the @xmath35 signal .",
    "however , this event does not have the correct @xmath39-value as will be demonstrated below .",
    "an @xmath39 spectrum containing the 23 events that fall inside the @xmath44 window is given in fig .",
    "this spectrum is spread out over the whole @xmath39 range and does not appear to be associated with fusion evaporation residue events seen at higher energies to be concentrated near channels 103 and 145 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "the only candidate event at @xmath45=196.0 mev , which satisfies the conditions for the @xmath46 , and @xmath28 signals , appears in channel 114 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b . by further checking all the detector signals for this event",
    ", it was concluded that it is a background event , probably arising from scatterings of a beam particle at several locations through the spectrometer .",
    "hence , only an upper limit for the measured cross section could be determined at this beam energy .",
    "these results show that a background suppression factor of about 4@xmath4710@xmath48 can be achieved with the upgraded fma and the present detector system .",
    "the uncertainties in the reported evaporation cross sections arise mainly from corrections for the charged state distribution , the fma transport efficiency , the detector efficiency , and counting statistics .",
    "the total uncertainties for the evaporation cross sections are around 10 - 17@xmath14 , except for the measurements at the two lowest energies where only upper limits can be given .",
    "the cross sections are listed in table i.    the fusion - fission cross sections for @xmath0ni + @xmath11mo have not been measured previously .",
    "they were , however , calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the code cascade @xcite .",
    "similar calculations with the same parameters were performed for the present experiment .",
    "the total fusion cross sections are also listed in table i , together with the fusion - fission cross sections .",
    "rather large uncertainties were given for the fusion - fission contributions resulting in somewhat larger errors for the total cross sections at the highest beam energies .",
    "the experimental results for the total fusion cross sections , spanning eight orders of magnitude , are presented as a function of laboratory energy in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( solid circles ) .",
    "the incident energies have been corrected for target thickness and for the steep energy dependence ; these corrections are small because rather thin targets were used . for the lowest two energies",
    "no evaporation residue was observed .",
    "the results are shown as upper limits corresponding to one count in each case .",
    "the two earlier measurements @xcite are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as open circles and open squares , respectively .",
    "statistical errors are smaller than the size of the symbols .",
    "the three measurements are generally in good agreement within the quoted uncertainties , except for the lowest energy point of ref .",

    "these two calculations reproduce the experimental data in the highest energy region and in the 0.1 to 10 @xmath12b range , but the cross sections in the region around e=130 mev are overpredicted .",
    "these calculations also overpredict the cross sections at the lowest energies , which is the main topic of the present study .",

    "this is a general feature of coupled - channels calculations and it is , therefore , very unlikely that any minor adjustment in the coupled - channels calculations would reproduce the steep falloff that the data exhibit at extreme sub - barrier energies .",
    "thus , it appears that the fusion hindrance behavior , which now has been observed for many systems , is also present in the new data for @xmath0ni+@xmath11mo .",

    "an elaborate coupling scheme is therefore needed in the coupled - channels calculations . at energies above the barrier , one - dimensional calculations result in higher cross sections when compared to coupled - channels calculations .",
    "this behavior is caused by the long - range coulomb - excitation / polarization of the low - lying quadrupole states , as pointed out in ref .",

    "only just reach the constant @xmath3-factor curve , the @xmath3-factor maximum is not fully developed .",
    "additional measurements would be required to clearly delineate the maximum in the @xmath3-factor .",
    "the dashed - dotted curve corresponds to the straight line extrapolation of the logarithmic derivative in fig .",
    "the two- and three - phonon calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7]b as dashed and solid curves , respectively .",
    "it is evident that coupled - channels calculations overpredict the fusion cross section at extreme sub - barrier energies .",
    "the experimental fusion data involving ni projectiles and compound nuclei in the a=100 - 200 region , are summarized in table iv . for four systems , namely the @xmath8ni+@xmath8ni , @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni , @xmath9ni+@xmath94y and the present @xmath0ni+@xmath11mo reactions ,",
    "the cross sections have been measured to sufficiently low energies to determine the energy , @xmath4 of the maximum of the @xmath3-factor representation .",
    "previously , we have obtained the @xmath4 values for the @xmath8ni+@xmath9ni and @xmath8ni+@xmath0ni systems  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath4 are listed in column three of table iv .",
    "two additional systems , namely @xmath8ni+@xmath97ge and @xmath0ni+@xmath97ge from ref.@xcite , have been measured down to levels close to where the @xmath3-factor maximum occurs .",
    "the logarithmic derivative for these systems is shown in fig .",
    "the location of the @xmath3-factor maximum was obtained by performing a small extrapolation ( solid line ) of the logarithmic derivative to where it crosses the constant @xmath3-factor line ( dashed line ) .",
    "the resulting values are listed in table iv . because of the uncertainties inherent in these extrapolations , errors of 2@xmath14 ( @xmath22 mev ) were assigned to the extrapolated @xmath4 data .",
    "table iv also lists other fusion systems involving ni beams for which the cross section was not measured down to a level that allows for determination of the @xmath3-factor maximum . for these systems",
    "only the lowest measured energy is listed .",
    "the values of @xmath4 are plotted as a function of the parameter @xmath102 in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and compared to the empirical formula ( solid curve ) , eq .  [ eq1 ] , obtained from a fit to all available fusion data involving stiff nuclei .",
    "obviously , only two systems , @xmath8ni+@xmath8ni and @xmath9ni+@xmath94y follow the systematics ; all other systems fall below the curve .",
    "previously , it has been pointed out  @xcite that there is a rather compelling correlation between the stiffness of the interacting nuclei and the location of the @xmath3-factor maximum , @xmath4 , relative to the empirical trend for the ni+ni systems .",
    "the addition to the systematics of the data points for @xmath0ni+@xmath11mo and for the two ni+ge systems , which all involve soft nuclei , appears to corroborate this observation .",
    "thus , for the @xmath0ni+@xmath11mo system , the value of @xmath5 predicted from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is @xmath5=134.5 mev whereas the measured value of @xmath4=120.6 mev is only 90@xmath14 of this value .",
    "the reason for this reduction is presumably that @xmath0ni + @xmath11mo should be viewed as an open - shell colliding system so that strong coupling effects broaden the effective barrier distribution and push the energy where the hindrance behavior occurs down to even lower energies .    the deviation of the measured or extrapolated values of @xmath4 from the expected @xmath5 value , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , thus appears to depend on the stiffness of the fusing nuclei .",
    "a quantitative relation between the stiffness and the deviation from @xmath5 is not yet known . as a first attempt",
    ", we associate the stiffness of a nucleus to its proximity to closed proton or neutron shells and define the number of `` valence nucleons '' , @xmath92 , as the sum of particles and holes outside the nearest closed shells . here , @xmath0ni is considered to have four holes in the n=40 neutron shell rather than eight particles outside n=28 .",
    "the values of @xmath92 are listed in table iv and , in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , the ratio @xmath103 is plotted as a function of this parameter .",
    "there is a general trend of decreasing values of @xmath104 with increasing values of @xmath92 .",
    "we observe that for the other systems in table iv , the data for @xmath87 ( upper limits ) are not in contradiction with figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig10 ] .",
    "it should be noted that all of the systems shown in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig10 ] and table iv have rather large negative fusion @xmath105values .",
    "one may also compare the @xmath4-values to the height of the coulomb barrier ( obtained from the bass prescription ) , which is listed in table iv .",
    "the ratio @xmath104 exhibit a stronger dependency on the value of @xmath92 than that obtained for the ratio @xmath106 indicating that the observed effect does not just depend on the change in the coulomb barrier height with addition of neutrons to the interacting nuclei .",
    "the above observations are all phenomenological in nature as there is at present no satisfactory understanding of the fusion hindrance at extreme sub - barrier energies .",
    "many authors have tried to explain this new phenomenon @xcite .",
    "one suggestion is to use a large diffuseness of the ion - ion potential in the coupled - channels calculations .",
    "this recipe is sometimes used to explain high - precision fusion data @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the failure to reproduce the steep fall - off is caused by the hill - wheeler approximation @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown , however , that these limitations of the analysis are not responsible for the observed sub - barrier fusion hindrance phenomenon .",
    "dasso and pollarolo tried to reduce the fusion cross sections by using a shallow well inside the barrier @xcite .",
    "giraud et al . investigated the effect of `` friction '' @xcite .",
    "more discussions about this phenomenon can be found in refs .",
    "all of these suggestions may improve the fit of calculations to the experimental data in some cases , but they do not provide a convincing explanation of the observed suppression in all systems .",
    "these studies are presently at the stage of raising questions and discovering weak points in the existing models .",
    "the data are most likely still insufficient to lead to the correct explanation .",
    "more precision sub - barrier fusion measurements are required to further explore which modifications in the theoretical models are relevant for a correct description of the phenomenon .",
    "the phenomenon of sub - barrier fusion hindrance was first observed in systems involving stiff nuclei and a simple expression  @xcite was derived for the energy at which the hindrance of fusion between such nuclei occurs .",
    "furthermore , a study of ni+ni fusion involving different ni isotopes  @xcite has shown that the onset of the fusion hindrance deviates from these systematics depending on the `` stiffness '' of the interacting nuclei .    in the present work ,",
    "we have measured the fusion excitation function for the system @xmath0ni+@xmath11mo down to a cross section level of @xmath25 nb , _",
    "i.e. _ about 12% below the bass barrier .",
    "we observe that the fusion process is hindered at the lowest energies relative to expectations based on coupled - channels calculations .",
    "the present study of the @xmath0ni+@xmath11mo system shows that the fusion hindrance for this system , as well as two other soft systems , deviates strongly from the systematics , and it thus corroborates the earlier observation in ni+ni systems .",
    "it is furthermore shown that this deviation depends monotonically on a parameter @xmath92 , which is the sum of nucleons ( holes ) outside of closed shells of the fusing nuclei suggesting that this parameter is a good measure of the `` stiffness '' of the interacting nuclei .    in conclusion , an interesting nuclear structure dependence of the fusion hindrance has been observed .",
    "the origin of this effect is still unknown .",
    "it occurs at relatively high excitation energies ( for systems in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig10 ] , they are around @xmath107 30 - 40 mev ) , where the natural width of compound levels is larger than their spacing .",
    "a lack of available final states thus appears to be ruled out as an explanation .",
