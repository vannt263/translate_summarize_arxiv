    "in this section , we report our numerical results of the qnms of the charged scalar perturbation around lifshitz black brane solutions .",
    "let us start with the imaginary part of qnms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . fixing the mass of the scalar field @xmath91 and increasing the charge @xmath37 of the background configuration , we observe that the absolute value of the imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency @xmath92 decreases .",
    "this behavior holds for all chosen values of the charge of the scalar field @xmath93 .",
    "this property is shown in fig .",
    "furthermore we find that fixing the charge of the black hole @xmath37 and the mass of the scalar field @xmath94 , the bigger value of @xmath95 leads to the smaller @xmath92 .",
    "but when @xmath96 , the @xmath95 influence on the imaginary part of the quasi - normal frequency disappears .",
    "the increase of the mass of the scalar field can enhance @xmath92 when the charges of the scalar field @xmath5 and the background @xmath37 are fixed .",
    "now , we turn to discuss the behavior of the real part of the quasi - normal frequency ( @xmath97 ) exhibited in fig .",
    "when the lifshitz exponent @xmath1 is close to the unity , we find that for fixed @xmath91 and @xmath93 , @xmath97 monotonically decreases with the increase of the charge @xmath37 in the background configuration .",
    "besides , fixing @xmath91 and @xmath37 , we observe that @xmath97 is smaller when @xmath95 becomes bigger , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] .",
    "when @xmath96 , the @xmath95 influence disappears as well for the real part of the frequency .",
    "when @xmath1 deviates a bit away from the unity , for small @xmath95 , @xmath97 still decreases with the increase of black hole charge @xmath37 .",
    "but when the scalar field is more charged with bigger @xmath95 , @xmath97 behaves differently and does not monotonically decrease with the increase of @xmath37 .",
    "instead , there is a barrier in the value of @xmath98 so that it increases when @xmath37 increases from zero , but then decreases when @xmath37 is over a critical value ( fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) . when @xmath1 is much bigger , from fig .",
    "[ fig1c ] , we see that @xmath97 increases from zero and flattens later with the increase of @xmath37 from zero when @xmath95 is small . for bigger @xmath95 ,",
    "the real part of the frequency will increase from zero to a maximum value and then slowly decreases when black hole charge approaches to the extreme value . comparing with the small @xmath99 case , here for zero black hole charge ,",
    "we observe a purely damping mode for charged scalar perturbation .",
    "the oscillation adds when @xmath37 is nonzero .",
    "when the mass of the scalar field is bigger , the difference caused by the small and large @xmath95 will be enlarged in @xmath97 when the black hole charge is small . when the black hole charge is big enough , the influence of the mass of scalar field on @xmath97 fades away .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] , we can see that for some choices of parameters , the imaginary frequency can approach zero and can even jump to be above zero which shows that the stability of the background configuration can be destroyed .",
    "this phenomenon happens when the charge of the background black brane solution is high enough , which corresponds to the low temperature .",
    "the instability is consistent with the description of the charged scalar field condensation to make the original lifshitz black brane to be a new hairy configuration .",

    "[ fig1b ] and [ fig1a ] ) for given values of @xmath91 and @xmath95 , there is no possibility to destroy the original background configuration , since even when @xmath37 takes the extreme value , the imaginary frequency is negative . for chosen value of the lifshitz exponent @xmath1",
    ", we can find threshold values for the mass and charge of scalar perturbation field to ensure the stability of the original lifshitz black brane when its charge @xmath37 is nearly extreme .",
    "these threshold values are listed in table [ tab1 ] . for fixing @xmath91 , when @xmath100 is below the corresponding threshold values for the chosen @xmath1 , the black brane can keep to be stable .",
    "when we fix @xmath95 , the mass of the scalar field is above the corresponding threshold value for the chosen @xmath101 can ensure the stability .",
    "@xmath102 has a lower bound @xmath103 according to eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) . thus @xmath91 can not be reduced infinitely so that in table [ tab1 ] at some @xmath1 the decrease of @xmath104 stops .",

    "this results is in agreement with the behavior of lifshitz superconductors where it was found that increasing dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 makes superconductor more difficult to be formed lifsup .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the behaviors of real and imaginary parts of quasi - normal frequencies with the change of lifshitz exponent @xmath1 have been illustrated . in @xcite , it was shown that for ( @xmath11)-dimensional uncharged dilaton - lifshitz black branes , independent of the value of @xmath91 , qnms corresponding to neutral scalar perturbations start overdamping ( with @xmath106 ) at @xmath2 . here , we find that for charged black branes , the point at which the real part of quasi - normal frequency of neutral scalar perturbation starts to vanish is no longer at @xmath2 , but depends on the value of @xmath91 ( see red and blue lines in fig .",

    "[ fig2a ] ) .",
    "now , we discuss the imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for small @xmath95 ,",
    "the absolute value of the imaginary part is always bigger than the corresponding value with bigger @xmath5 . with the increase of the lifshitz exponent @xmath1 ,",
    "the absolute value of @xmath107 increases . for large @xmath1 , @xmath92 has little dependence on @xmath95 and it is mainly influenced by the value of @xmath91 .",
    "we have mainly reported qnm behaviors of the charged scalar perturbation in the lifshitz black brane background with @xmath48 . for the lifshitz black hole case with @xmath49",
    "we have found similar results .",
    "we do not repeat explaining these similar results here for lifshitz black holes .",
    "one of the important subject in black hole physics is to investigate the resonances for the scattering of incoming waves by black holes .",
    "quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) of a black hole spacetime are indeed the proper solutions of the perturbation equations .",
    "it is a general belief that qnms carry unique footprints to directly identify the black hole existence .",
    "most available studies on qnms corresponding to lifshitz solutions are restricted to neutral scalar perturbations . in this paper",
    ", we have extended the study to the charged scalar perturbation in the background of ( @xmath11)-dimensional charged dilaton lifshitz branes / holes .",
    "asymptotic lifshitz solutions are interesting duals to many condensed matter systems .    we have used the improved asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) to calculate the charged scalar perturbations numerically and examine the influences of different model parameters on the imaginary and real parts of quasi - normal frequencies of the charged scalar field perturbations around lifshitz black solutions . in contrast to the case of neutral scalar perturbations , we found that it is possible to destroy the lifshitz configuration . to be more clear",
    ", we observed that for suitable choices of model parameters , imaginary part of qnm frequencies can be positive near extreme charge value of lifshitz configuration where temperature is low . for a chosen @xmath1",

    "fixing @xmath95 and taking the mass of the scalar field above the corresponding threshold value , or fixing @xmath108 and keeping the charge of the scalar field below the threshold value , the black brane / hole stability can be protected . in terms of @xmath1 , it was shown that when it is more away from unity , it is more difficult for the lifshitz background to become unstable . this result is consistent with the observation that lifshitz superconductors are more difficult to be formed for greater values of lifshitz exponent @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we have also observed rich dependence of the quasinormal fequencies on the mass of the scalar field @xmath91 , the charge @xmath37 of the background configuration and the charge of the scalar field @xmath95 .",
    "we have also investigated the behaviors of the real and imaginary parts of quasi - normal frequencies in terms of the lifshitz exponent @xmath1 .",
    "we found out that for charged black branes , the point at which neutral qnms start overdamping is no longer at @xmath2 as what was claimed in @xcite for uncharged lifshitz black branes , but it has dependence on the value of @xmath91 . for fixed @xmath91 , when @xmath109 is small , @xmath97 reduces and finally flattens when the lifshitz exponent @xmath1 becomes big .",
