    "the angular clustering of faint @xmath11-selected field galaxies has been studied extensively ( e.g. , efstathiou et al .  1991 ; roche et al .  1993 , 1996 ;",
    "brainerd , smail & mould 1995 ; hudon & lilly 1996 ; lidman & peterson 1996 ; villumsen , freudling & da costa 1996 ; woods & fahlman 1997 ) , and a prime motivation of these studies has been to investigate the nature of the faint field population .",
    "in particular , it is possible to infer the effective correlation length of the sample and the rate at which clustering evolves from a combination of the amplitude of the angular autocorrelation function , @xmath1 , and the redshift distribution of the faint galaxies , @xmath12 .",
    "these observations can then be used to link properties of the faint field population with samples of local galaxies .",
    "while the exact interpretation remains controversial , it is generally accepted that overall @xmath1 is fitted well by a power law of the form @xmath13 ( although see infante & pritchet ( 1995 ) for evidence of a flattening in the power - law coefficient at faint limits ) .",
    "here we investigate the clustering of faint galaxies and focus on the behavior of @xmath1 at small angular separations .",
    "we obtain a clear measurement of @xmath1 on scales of @xmath14 whereas previous investigations have been largely limited to scales of @xmath15 .",
    "additionally , we use the clustering properties of the galaxies to estimate the number of pairs of galaxies that are physically close to each other in space ( separations of @xmath7  kpc ) .",
    "the data consist of deep @xmath11-band imaging of 11 independent fields that were obtained in good conditions with the low resolution imaging spectrograph on the 10-m keck - i telescope .",
    "each of the @xmath16 fields is centered on a high redshift quasar with high galactic latitude ; however , the presence of the quasar in the field is irrelevant to the present investigation ( i.e. , the presence of a small group of galaxies at the redshift of the quasar will not influence the results below ) .",
    "the galaxy catalogs are complete to @xmath17 and the apparent magnitudes of the galaxies have been corrected for extinction . in order to reduce the stellar contamination in the object catalogs , only objects with @xmath18 are considered in the analysis below .",
    "there is , of course , some residual stellar contamination of the galaxy catalogs at faint limits and we estimate that to be : @xmath1916% ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath1913% ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath1911% ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the integral constraints vary little from field to field due to the use of the same detector in all cases as well as the lack of very large , bright galaxies in the fields .",
    "to compute the angular clustering of the faint galaxies we use the landy & szalay ( 1993 ) estimator : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the number of unique data - data , data - random , and random - random pairs within a given angular separation bin .",
    "regions of the frame where faint galaxy detection was either lower than average or impossible ( e.g. , due to the presence of bright stars and galaxies ) were masked out when computing @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "raw correlation functions ( uncorrected for stellar contamination or the integral constraint ) were determined for each of the fields , from which a mean correlation function was computed .",
    "the results for the mean raw correlation function are shown in figure  1 , where the error bars show the standard deviation in the mean . from top to bottom , the panels show the results for objects with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively . also shown",
    "are the formal best - fitting power laws of the form @xmath27 ( solid lines ) and the best - fitting power laws of the form @xmath13 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the power laws in the figure have been suppressed by the appropriate integral constraints and no correction for residual stellar contamination has been applied .    the number of pairs of galaxies that we observe to be separated by @xmath28 is larger than the number predicted by the fiducial @xmath13 power law ( i.e. , the power law that is typically obtained from measurements that have been performed on scales of @xmath29 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of carlberg et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and infante et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who both found @xmath1 to have a higher amplitude on small angular scales ( @xmath30 ) than a simple inward extrapolation of @xmath1 as measured at large angular scales .",
    "as yet , however , it is unclear whether the steepening of @xmath1 is due to the existence of a population of `` companion '' galaxies ( which are not seen at the present epoch ) or luminosity enhancement ( e.g. , due to interactions ) of intrinsically faint galaxies that are in pairs .    in the absence of significant luminosity enhancement",
    ", we can estimate the number of pairs of galaxies that are physically close to each other simply by using the following probability : @xmath31 ( e.g. , burkey et al .",
    "1994 ) , where @xmath32 is the number density of galaxies brighter than the faintest member in a pair of galaxies that is a candidate for close physical separation , @xmath33 is the observed angular separation between the galaxies , and @xmath34 is the smallest separation observed between all detected galaxies ( @xmath35 in our data ) . using eqn .",
    "( 2 ) we compute the number of pairs of galaxies for which @xmath36 and @xmath37 in our data .",
    "additionally , we use monte carlo simulations ( in which the magnitudes of the galaxies are shuffled at random ) to calculate the number of pairs of galaxies that would have @xmath36 and @xmath37 simply by chance .",
    "the latter step allows the removal of random superpositions from the estimate of the `` true '' number of close pairs in the sample .    below @xmath28",
    "there are fewer pairs of galaxies with @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the actual data than are expected in a random distribution ( i.e. , based on the monte carlo simulations ) , indicating that we are undercounting the very closest pairs due to blending of the images . using our measured @xmath1 , however",
    ", we can correct the faint pair counts on scales @xmath38 and estimate the fraction of galaxies in our sample that are in truly close physical pairs .    based on a simple extrapolation of the cfrs redshift distribution",
    ", we expect that the mean redshift of our galaxies is @xmath39 and , hence , if @xmath40 , physical pairs of galaxies that are separated by @xmath41 will be within @xmath42  kpc of each other .",
    "the best - fitting power law form of @xmath1 ( corrected for stellar contamination and the integral constraint ) then yields an estimate of the pair fraction at this physical separation of @xmath6 for @xmath43 , which agrees with the results obtained by carlberg et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for the fraction of galaxy pairs with separations @xmath44  kpc at @xmath8 .",
    "this suggests , therefore , that little evolution in the merger rate of galaxies occurred between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "a significant amount of work remains to be done on this project , including a clustering analysis of 7 additional independent fields and a more rigorous study of the number of pairs of faint galaxies located at close physical separation .",
