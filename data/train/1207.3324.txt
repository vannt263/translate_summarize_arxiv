    "spin and pseudospin symmetries are @xmath0 symmetries of a dirac hamiltonian with vector and scalar potentials .",

    "these symmetries may explain degeneracies in some heavy meson spectra ( spin symmetry ) or in single - particle energy levels in nuclei ( pseudospin symmetry ) , when these physical systems are described by relativistic mean - field theories with scalar and vector potentials @xcite .",
    "however , for bound systems whose potentials go to zero at infinity , pseudospin symmetry can not be realized , because @xmath3 ( which must go to zero in the limit of exact pseudospin symmetry ) is also the binding potential . for anti - fermions",
    "the opposite occurs , i.e. , one can not have exact spin symmetry , i.e. , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this behavior has been related by several authors to the perturbative nature of spin and pseudospin symmetry @xcite .",
    "the problem of a fermion moving in the background of a general mixing of vector and scalar coulomb fields has been originally solved for investigating the implications of a tiny contribution of the scalar coulomb potential to the atomic spectroscopy @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the fact that this problem has analytical solutions for arbitrary ( to a point ) scalar and vector coulomb radial potentials to examine in a detailed and explicit way , both for fermions and anti - fermions , the onset of spin and pseudospin symmetries and assess their perturbative nature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dirac_coulomb_gen ] we review the general solutions of the dirac equation with spherical scalar and vector coulomb potentials , discuss their quantum numbers and their relation with ( pseudo)spin quantum numbers , and present the formulas for the energy eigenvalues .",
    "we also discuss in detail the node structure of the radial wave functions and compare them to what is known from other kind of radial mean - field potentials . in the next section we present the expansions of the energy eigenvalues for positive and negative energy solutions in terms of relevant potential parameters for spin and pseudospin symmetries and discuss the perturbative nature of those symmetries .",
    "next we discuss the quantum numbers and extra degeneracies of the dirac equation solutions when there is spin and pseudospin symmetry .",
    "we find that these are similar to the ones found in non - relativistic hydrogenic atoms .",

    "<S> we analyze in detail the analytical solutions of the dirac equation with scalar s and vector v coulomb radial potentials near the limit of spin and pseudospin symmetries , i.e. , when those potentials have the same magnitude and either the same sign or opposite signs , respectively . by performing an expansion of the relevant coefficients we also assess the perturbative nature of both symmetries and their relations the ( pseudo)spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the former analysis is made for both positive and negative energy solutions and we reproduce the relations between spin and pseudospin symmetries found before for nuclear mean - field potentials . we discuss the node structure of the radial functions and the quantum numbers of the solutions when there is spin or pseudospin symmetry , which we find to be similar to the well - known solutions of hydrogenic atoms . </S>"
