    "the electric dipole resonances of spheroidal particles are very sensitive to their shape and can be tuned by the aspect ratio of their main axes .",

    "the ratio of the semiaxis @xmath6 ( parallel to the z direction ) to the semiaxis @xmath7 ( perpendicular to z direction ) characterizes the shape of each particle , which may vary from a nearly spherical ( @xmath8 ) to a nanodisk ( @xmath9 ) or a nanorod one ( @xmath10 ) . here",
    ", we assume that nanoparticles are small enough compared to the smallest separation distance and thermal wavelength @xmath11 in the system ( c is the vacuum light velocity , @xmath12 is planck s constant , and @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "this assumption insures that the heat transfer between particles can be calculated through simple fluctuating dipoles .",
    "the net radiative heat exchanged between two particles ( _ i_th and _ j_th ) in a n - body system can be written in the general form @xcite    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the difference of mean energies of planck oscillators at frequency @xmath16 and at the temperatures of two interacting nanoparticles .",

    "the non - negatively defined @xmath23 guarantees a correct direction for heat flux between particles , i.e. from hotter to colder particle .",
    "moreover , the influence of the geometrical arrangement of nanoparticles as well as the many - body effects on the heat flux are taken into account by @xmath24 matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite :    @xmath27^{-1}_{ij}\\\\ & & \\hat{\\mathbb c}_{ij}=[k^2\\mathbbm{g}\\mathbb a]_{ij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 stands for the unit dyadic tensor , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the free space dyadic green s tensor is :    @xmath32\\\\ & & \\nonumber f(x)=[x^{-1}+ix^{-2}-x^{-3}]\\exp(ix)\\\\ & & \\nonumber g(x)=[-x^{-1}-3ix^{-2}+3x^{-3}]\\exp(ix)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which has the contribution of near- , intermediate- and far - zone terms , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively . here",

    "it can be seen that the imaginary part of the susceptibility tensor of particles 1 and 2 ( corresponding to their absorption ) are presented in the transmission probability of both systems .",
    "we factorized this term to highlight the influence of ( particles 1 and 2 ) shapes on the transmission probabilities .",
    "the first term in the parenthesis of the right hand in eq.([eq.4 ] ) corresponds to the direct heat flux between particles 1 and 2 in a three body system .",
    "the two other terms represent the indirect ( but forward ) heat flux between these particles tunneled ( scattered / absorbed ) through the third particle . to a first approximation",
    ", the sum of these two terms can be considered as _ three - body _ effect , specially in case of large separation distances . on the other side , only a term related to the direct heat transfer between particles 1 and 2 appeared in the heat flux of a two - body system (",
    "see the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq.6 ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore , the multiple scattering ( i.e. forward and backward ) of radiating waves between particles are accounted for by the fabry - prot like denominator ( @xmath46 ) in the heat transmission probabilities of both two- and three - body systems .",
    "while this quantity depends only on the arrangement and characteristics of particles 1 and 2 in a two - body system , it also depends on position and characteristics of the third particles in three - body system .",
    "the transmission probability can show resonance due to the fabry - prot like denominator appeared in eqs .",
    "( [ eq.4 ] ) and ( [ eq.6 ] ) for three- and two - body systems , respectively .",
    "these modes will came into resonance whenever @xmath47 inwhich @xmath48 .",
    "the resonant eigenfrequencies ( eigen modes ) satisfy @xmath49 where @xmath50 s are eigenfunctions of matrix @xmath51 . for the special case of",
    "identical spherical nanoparticles , one can show that this condition can be written as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 s are the eigenfunctions of the interaction matrix @xmath54 .",
    "for an arbitrary collection of @xmath55 interacting nanoparticles with volume @xmath56 , there exist at most @xmath57 number of such modes ( in dipolar limit @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the smallest center - center separation distance in the system ) that contribute to the resultant heat exchange between particles in the system .",
    "the resonance frequencies of these modes can be tuned by varying shape , arrangement , size , and composition of nanoparticles ( for more details on resonance in large sphere dimers see @xcite ) .    while any symmetry in the system ( including geometric arrangement and/or shapes ) my accompanied by increasing degeneracy of the resonance frequencies , the number of _ distinct _ modes that can be excited are depending sensitively on @xmath60 . for periodic arrangement of nanoparticles ( or even in random gas of particles ) , the interaction matrix is highly degenerate . at intermediate ( @xmath61 ) to large ( @xmath62 ) separation distances , the resonance frequencies in this system congregate to the resonance of susceptibility of an individual particles ( surface modes ) , occurring for a spherical particle at @xmath63 ( where , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the complex dielectric function of the background medium and particle respectively ) .",
    "this property is shown by ben - abdallah and his co - workers in sphere - dimer and sphere - trimer systems@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the contribution of the third particle to the heat flux in a three - body system appeared in both the numerator and denominator of the transmission probability in eq .",
    "( [ eq.4 ] ) .",
    "as maintained before , while the former represents the contribution of the third particle in forward heat flux , the latter affects the resonance frequencies of transmission probability through multiple scattering of radiation .",
    "the crucial point to be noted is that the weight with which a mode contributes to the resultant transmission probability depends on the numerator of the transmission probability .",
    "the weight of the direct heat flux has contribution of far - field regime , @xmath66 , where @xmath67-term dominates , as well as the near field regime , where @xmath68 is largest .",
    "moreover , the contribution of three - body part leads to @xmath69 to @xmath70 terms due to forward heat flux through the third particle , where in combination with multiple scattering , it decays even faster at small separation distances . in the case of @xmath71 ,",
    "the dipole approximation is not valid and multipolar modes contribution to the heat transfer should be taken into account . at sufficiently large separation distances ( in practice , a distance on the order of few radii in case of spherical particles ) , the heat transmission probability is mainly decided by the susceptibility of particles 1 and 2 as emitter and/or absorber .",
    "this dependence appeared as @xmath72 in both two- and three - body systems , which can be optimized by tuning the overlap of polarizability tensor components even by shape or material .",
    "as shown by incardone _ et.al , _ the heat transfer between two spheroids can be switched on / of by changing their relative orientation @xcite .",
    "the presence of additional particle leads to significant modification in the transmission probability which depends in a complicated manner on shapes in the limit of small separations . in the case of spherical nanoparticles",
    ", the heat flux between two particles can be enhanced by inserting a third nanoparticle in the middle @xcite and can be tuned by it s size @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq.9 ] ) reflects a simplified approach , since contributions from the higher order scattering at small separation distances are not shown .",
    "it can be seen that , although the heat flux between particles 1 and 2 explicitly depends on the imaginary part of @xmath77 , it depends on the real part of the polarizability tensor as well .",
    "the real part of the polarizability , denoted by @xmath79 is the dispersive part of the polarizability . likewise , the imaginary part of the polarizability , denoted by @xmath80 , is the absorptive part @xcite .",
    "the first term in eq . ( [ eq.9 ] ) can be attributed to the third particle contribution to the heat transfer by scattering , and the second term corresponds to the absorption by the third particle .",
    "we should notice that in the region near sfm resonance , the real part of polarizability components is anti - symmetric about the resonances while the imaginary part is symmetric .",
    "the particular form of @xmath74 depends on the particular arrangement in which particles disposed in the system .",
    "thus we can conclude that , in addition to the geometrical arrangement , the albelo of the third particle ( i.e. , the competition between its scattering and absorption ) has a major rule in the heat transfer in three - body system .    since the formalism of the model based on the dipole approximation , the results are valid for arbitrary shape ( polarizability tensor ) , size and distances as long as we stay in this regime .",
    "if particle sizes are too large compared to separation distances , the contribution of multipolar interaction is needed for accurate results .",
    "however , the dipole limit would be enough to reveals cryptic aspects of heat transfer dependency on shape in these systems . in our analysis , we denote the complex polarizability tensor by @xmath81 , where for convenience we labeled the polarizability parallel to the z - axis as @xmath82 , and the polarizability perpendicular to the z - axis as @xmath83 .",
    "these components are related to the dielectric function of the object by the relation @xcite    @xmath84    [ ]    where @xmath85 is the volume of particle and @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) are depolarization factors . for an arbitrary ratio of the semiaxes @xmath7 and @xmath6 ,",
    "depolarization factors can be computed from integrals :    @xmath89    by considering a constant volume for particles , the ratio of the paralell depolarization @xmath87 to the perpendicular depolarization @xmath90 ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) characterizes the nanoparticle shape , which may vary from a nearly nano - rod ( @xmath92 ) to a spherical ( @xmath93 ) or to a nanodisk ( @xmath94 ) . the components of polarizability tensor in terms of @xmath95 would be    @xmath96    where we set @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear from symmetry reason that the product @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.6 ] ) gives a maximum transmission probability in the frequency of the surface phonon modes ( sfms ) for a two - body system , in which @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the resonance condition is fulfilled when @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath103 , implying intense scattering / absorption .",
    "a similar argument holds for the case of three - body system , however , the presence of the third particle allows for a large freedom of tunability .",
    "depending on the shape of the third particle , the heat exchange between particles 1 and 2 may increase or decrease with respect to the two - body case . besides the electric dipole radiation",
    ", the magnetic dipole radiation would contribute to the heat exchange , which is not considered here and may come into resonance at well - defined values of ratio of size that alter the heat transfer .",

    "let us now , apply these theoretical frameworks to study the shape - dependent heat transfer in a three - body system . in order to reduce the number of parameters , we will focus on the symmetric case in which particles 1 and 2 are identical ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) with separation distance @xmath108  nm .",
    "the shape of the third elliptic particle ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) can be used for tuning its scattering properties and thus for tuning the heat exchange between 1 and 2 .",

    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath117  k and @xmath118  k , so the first nanoparticle acts as emitter and the heat exchange between particles 1 and 2 reduces to the heat flux from 1 to 2 . the calculation performed for three special cases in which particles 1 and 2 are nanorod , sphere and nanodisk .",
    "figure ( [ fig2 ] ) , represents the normalized heat exchange between particles 1 and 2 with respect to the shape of the third one .",
    "we have used @xmath119 for _ rod - rod _",
    ", @xmath105 for _ disk - disk _ , and @xmath104 for _ sphere - sphere _ configurations . since @xmath98 , and consequently @xmath120 ,",
    "the optical properties of the third nanoparticle is very important and plays a vital rule on the heat transfer .",
    "we observe that the heat exchange between particles 1 and 2 depends on the third particle depolarization aspect ratio @xmath109 and may increase or decrease in comparison with the two - body case . when the mismatch of shapes ( i.e. , @xmath121 ) is large , the many - body effect is weak , whereas for small mismatches the many - body effect becomes pronounced . for @xmath122 , many - body effect dominated by scattering which gives rise to the heat transfer",
    "in contrast , for @xmath123 absorption is stronger than scattering and as a result the heat exchange decrease in comparison with the two - body system .",
    "the maximum ( minimum ) of the heat transfer profile corresponds to the maximum ( minimum ) albedo of the third particle around the sfm resonance frequencies of the other particles .",
    "on the other hand , the behaviors of the real and imaginary parts of the third particles polarizability have a crucial rule in many - body effect .",
    "this effect is especially strong when the third particle polarizability resonance frequencies are close to the sfm resonance of emitter / absorber particle .     and transverse @xmath124 to the axis of symmetry ) of a sic spheroid nanoparticle as a function of shape parameter @xmath95 .",
    "the particle volume is kept constant at that of sphere with radius @xmath125  nm .",

    "the frequencies of sfms are specified by the depolarization factors and subsequently by the shape of nanoparticles .",
    "the shape - dependent prolate - to - oblate resonance of the third particles polarizability components are illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "since prolate and oblate nanoparticles have a symmetry axes , they have three proper modes , which two of them are degenerate . as the aspect ratio of the third nanoparticle deviate from one , the energy separation between sfms increases . in the case of nanorod",
    "( i.e. , @xmath131 ) , the high - energy absorbing band corresponds to the oscillation of the electrons along the @xmath7 of the rod .",
    "this absorption band is relatively insensitive to the nanorod aspect ratio and spectrally is near to the resonance of the spherical nanoparticle .",
    "the other absorption band at lower energies is caused by the oscillation of charges along the @xmath6 of the rod .",
    "as @xmath109 approaches 1 from below , these bands move toward each other and coalesce for spherical nanoparticle . finally , when @xmath132 , the switch of energy takes place between the two energy bands . on the other hand , for @xmath132",
    ", the high - energy absorbing band corresponds to the oscillation of the electrons along @xmath6 , while the _ two fold _ degenerate resonance of the electron oscillation along @xmath7 occurs at lower energies for nanodisk .",
    "depending on the shapes of particles 1 ( and 2 ) , the albedo of the third particle affects the energy transmission probability defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq.4 ] ) . in order to see the physics behind this dependence ,",
    "the transmission probability spectra @xmath133 in a three - body system for a frequency range around the sfms of the third particle are shown in figs .",

    "figure ( [ fig4]a ) shows the results for _ rod - rod _ configuration , while the transmission spectra for _ sphere - sphere _ and _ disk - disk _ configurations are presented in figs .",
    "( [ fig4]b ) and ( [ fig4]c ) , respectively .",
    "it can be observed that the heat transmission probability shows two main distinct resonance for _ rod - rod _ and _ disk - disk _ configuration , which reduces to _ three fold _ degenerate sfm in the case of _ sphere - sphere _ configuration . since particles 1 and 2 are identical , the overlap of @xmath134 and @xmath135 is large in all cases .",
    "consequently , the many - body part of the transmission probability mainly depends on the overlap of the third nanoparticle polarizability with the two others . in the case of _ rod - rod _ configuration , this overlap occurs for @xmath136 , where both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath137 are in resonance with sfms of the emitter .",
    "it has to be noted that @xmath138 and @xmath139 show resonance at different frequencies .",
    "while the contribution of the longitudinal mode ( i. e. , @xmath140 ) to the three - body effect is pronounced in _ rod - rod _ configuration , the contribution of the transverse mode ( i. e. , @xmath141 ) is dominant in _ disk - disk _ configuration . in the case of the _ sphere - sphere _ configuration , it can be observed that the heat transmission probability is mediated by the shape of the third particle for polarizability ratio @xmath142 . by slightly deviation of the third particles shape from sphere , the heat transmission would increase or decrease in comparison with the two - body case . in the case of _ disk - disk _ configuration ,",
    "the scattering / absorption by the third particle modifies the transmission intensity for @xmath143 .",
    "the resonance of the scattering and absorption by the third particle is located at @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "once again , the change in the transmission probability occurs mainly in low frequencies due to resonance of @xmath138 .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that in all cases , the third particle s scattering / absorption property is off - resonance for large @xmath146 , and transmission spectra is not affected by the shape of the third particle .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the effect of the particles shape in radiative heat transfer .",
    "it is shown that the energy transmission probability between two nanoparticles in a three - body system may be increased or decreased , depending on dipolar resonance frequency modes of the third nanoparticle .",
