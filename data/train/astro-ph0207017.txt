    "determining the continuum production mechanism is critical for understanding the central engine in agn , a fundamental goal in extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "the continuum emission of the blazar class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is dominated by non - thermal radiation from the radio to the x ray , up to the mev , gev and in some cases tev energy bands .",
    "this emission is often rapidly variable at all frequencies and , in general , it has been observed that the amplitude of flux density variations increases and the time scales decrease as a function of frequency from the radio to the x - ray .",
    "a natural explanation is that blazars are dominated by relativistic jets at small angles to the line of sight ( blandford & rees 1978 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the variability behaviour of a blazar in a given band depends also from its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "it is well known that the blazar sed is double - peaked ( in a @xmath0 representation ) .",
    "this is interpreted as due to non thermal synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission , with the first component due to synchrotron radiation and peaking at ir to x - ray frequencies and the second one due to inverse compton scattering and peaking in the gev to tev band ( e.g. fossati et al .",
    "the location of the synchrotron peak is used to define different classes of blazars : hbl ( high frequency peak blazars ) and lbl ( low frequency peak blazars ) ( giommi & padovani 1994 ) . in the most studied bands , i.e. radio , optical and x - ray , one expects that different sources have different variability behaviour , depending from where the synchrotron peak is located .",
    "normally one expect that the variability is more enhanced after the synchrotron peak , towards the end part of the synchrotron emission , where the cooling time of the electron is shorter .",
    "longer time scale are expected , and observed , in the radio and far - ir bands .",
    "correspondingly , in the x - ray band we expect fast variability for sources that hare dominated by the synchrotron emission ( hbl ) , while for the sources whose x - ray emission is due to the inverse compton mechanism we do not expect frequent and rapid variability .",
    "actually , the same source can have the synchrotron peak located at different frequencies , e.g. in the presence of flare like events , as the one seen in mkn501 .",
    "this can be explained as due to the injection of fresh electron in the jet ( pian et al .",
    "1998 ) .    since blazars emit over the entire electromagnetic spectrum , a key for understanding blazar variability is the acquisition of several wide band spectra in different luminosity states during major flaring episodes .",
    "coupling spectral and temporal information greatly constrains the jet physics , since different models predict different variability as a function of wavelength . before the _ beppo_sax advent ,",
    "important progress in this respect has been achieved for some of the brightest and most studied blazars , as pks2155 - 304 ( urry et al .",
    "1997 ) , bllac ( bloom et al . 1997 ) , 3c279 ( wehrle et al .",
    "however , thanks to its good energy resolution and sensitivity over an unprecedented large x - ray energy band , from 0.01 up to 200 kev ,",
    "_ beppo_sax immediately provided unique results in the multiwavelength study of blazar ( e.g. pks2155 - 304 giommi et al .",
    "1998 , chiappetti et al . 1999 ; mkn501 pian et al . 1998 ) .",
    "having in mind all these results we successfully used the _",
    "beppo_sax satellite to perform target of opportunity ( too ) observations of blazars , that were known to be in a high state from observations carried out either in the optical or x - ray or tev bands .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we presented some of the most important results that were obtained with _",
    "beppo_sax too observations of blazars .",
    "they immediately show the importance of observing in the x - ray band blazars that are known to be in a high state . with _",
    "beppo_sax this is even more true : thanks to its large energy range , it has been possible to simultaneously detect both the synchrotron and the compton components .",
    "we detected fast variability events that allowed us to put constraints on the size of the emitting region and to infer the properties of the jets responsible for the blazars emission .",
    "but we had also limits in this projects .",
    "for instance , it can be seen from table 1 that the blazars too program has been dominated by optical triggers .",
    "thus , we are probably biased towards sources that have an higher optical variability",
    ". these should be the blazars that have the synchrotron peak in the ir - optical band , i.e. sources with the peak on the left side of the bands in which the blazars are usually monitored .",
    "these are of course essentially lbl or intermediate blazars .",
    "sources that have the synchrotron peak in the uv  x - ray band are not expected to show strong optical variability .",
    "they are probably more easily detected in a high state from systematic monitoring at higher frequencies .",
    "of course this is much more difficult than in the optical and this explain while in table 1 there are only two x - ray triggers .",
    "this could explain the fact that most of the sources observed as too observations were in a high state in the x - ray band , but not in an extremely high state .",
    "moreover , we note that from the optical trigger to the actual x - ray observations normally there are delays of a few days and this could also explain while we did not find sources in exceptionally high states .",
    "these observations shows also that the synchrotron peak frequency does not seem to vary a lot in the lbl or intermediate objects . on the contrary ,",
    "strong shifts have been observed for mkn501 and mkn421 that are hbl .",
    "this is in line with the findings of costamante et al ( 2001 ) , that studied with _",
    "beppo_sax blazars with extreme synchrotron peak frequencies ( @xmath1 kev ) .",
    "they found that these sources seems to be characterised by larger @xmath2 variability , compared with lower @xmath2 objects ( see fig .",
    "we detected strong spectral variability , founding in the same source either two or only one component .",
    "we also found fast variability , but only in the synchrotron component of sources showing both the synchrotron and the compton components .",
    "fast variability is present also in the optical band , but it is less pronounced and there is no one to one correspondance .",
    "all this can be intepreted with the presence of a steady compton component , and the erratic variability of the synchrotron tail emission , coming in and out of the soft x - ray band .",
    "the compton emission we see in the x - ray band is well below the compton peak and it is produced by low energy electrons scattering low frequency synchrotron photons .",
    "the variability seen in the synchrotron part can be obtained by changing the slope of the injected electron distribution , without affecting the total injected power .",
    "time to time there are variability also in the compton component and this imply a strong modification of the overall blazar sed , as in the case of the 1997 bllac flare .",
    "all these behaviours can be reproduced by the presence of relativistic jets dominated by shock events produced by colliding shells ( e.g. spada et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in any case these observations show the importance of observing blazars over such a large x - ary energy band while they are in a high state . it will be crucial to perform these too observations also in the future and in particular for blazars that are detected in a high state in the x - ray or tev bands , now that new and more sensitive tev telescope will be operational . in the forseable future",
    "these too observations , as the one carried out with _ beppo_sax , will be possible probably either with the combination of simultaneous observations from integral and other soft x - ray satellites ( such as xmm - newton or chandra ) , or with the swift satellite",
    ". swift will be launched at the end of 2003 .",
    "swift is dedicated to the study of gamma ray bursts , but it should also observe other interesting sources , whose emission goes from the soft to the hard x rays , and blazars are obvious good candidates ."
