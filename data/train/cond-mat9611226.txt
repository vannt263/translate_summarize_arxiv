    "electrons moving on a lattice immersed in a magnetic field have attracted much attention due to their relevance to many physical problems . in particular , quantum interference ( qi )",
    "effects between different electron paths in disordered electron systems have been a subject of intense study because they play an important role in quantum transport .",
    "for instance , the qi of closed loops and their time - reversed paths is central to weak - localization phenomena.@xcite indeed , during the past decade and half , many fascinating phenomena  including universal conductance fluctuations as well as magnetic - field and spin - orbit scattering effects on the conductivity  observed in the _ weakly _ localized , metallic regime have been understood in terms of the qi between different feynman diffusive paths in backscattering loops ( i.e. , paths bringing an electron back to the starting point ) .",
    "recently , interest has grown in the effects of a magnetic field on _ strongly _ localized electrons@xcite with variable - range hopping ( vrh ) where striking qi phenomena has been observed in mesoscopic and macroscopic insulators or strongly disordered compounds : anomalous magnetoresistance , pronounced conductance fluctuations , aharonov - bohm oscillations with periods of @xmath8 and @xmath1 , and the hall effect .",
    "this strongly localized regime@xcite is less well - understood than the weak - localization case .    in the strongly localized regime , the major mechanism for transport",
    "is thermally activated hopping between the localized sites . in the vrh introduced by mott,@xcite localized electrons , whose wavefunctions decay exponentially with a localization length @xmath9 , hop a distance which is many times larger than @xmath9 . as a result of the balance between the probabilities for hopping and thermal activation",
    ", mott derived that in @xmath10 dimensions the hopping length changes with temperature as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a characteristic temperature .",
    "therefore , the lower the temperature is , the further away the electron tunnels in order to find a localized site of closer energy .    according to the ",
    "critical path analysis\"@xcite arguments , the conductance of the sample is governed by one critical hopping event . during this critical phonon - assisted tunneling process",
    ", the electron traverses many other impurities since the hopping length is very large at low temperatures . while encountering these intermediate scatterers",
    ", the electron preserves its phase memory .",
    "this elastic multiple - scattering is the origin of the qi effects associated with a single hopping event between the initial ( @xmath13 ) and final ( @xmath14 ) sites .",
    "the overall tunneling amplitude @xmath15 between the sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 is therefore the sum of the contributions from all possible paths connecting them.@xcite in other words , the tunneling probability of one distant hop is determined by the interference of many electron paths between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this leads to mott s law for the temperature dependence of the conductivity in @xmath10 dimensions:@xcite @xmath16.\\ ] ] it is worthwhile to note that , in the limit of strong localization , the dominant contribution to @xmath15 comes from the shortest paths between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( i.e. , the  directed path model \" ) . in other words , only interference between _ forward - scattering _ paths need to be taken into account .",
    "this is in contrast with weak localization which results from _ backscattering _ processes on closed paths .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the qi effects on @xmath15 and relevant physical quantities due to the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we will use the model proposed in ref .  3 , which is used in most of the recent theoretical work in this area .",
    "in this model , the impurities are arranged on a regular square ( cubic ) lattice in 2d ( 3d ) and a nearest - neighbor tight - binding anderson hamiltonian is employed .    in this work",
    "we investigate the qi of strongly localized electrons by doing _",
    "summations over _ all _ forward - scattering paths between two _ arbitrary _ sites .",
    "we derive compact _ closed - form",
    "_ expressions for various physical quantities ( e.g. , the transition strength which determines the conductivity ) for electrons propagating on a square lattice subject to an external magnetic field , with and without random impurities .",
    "we also obtain an explicit formula for an experimentally important case that has been much less studied theoretically so far : the interference between paths on a 3d cubic lattice .    in the disordered case , by analytically computing the moments for the tunneling probability and employing the replica method",
    ", we derive _ analytic _",
    "results for the magnetoconductance ( mc ) in terms of _ sums - over - paths _ , which are applicable in _ any dimension_. our explicit field - dependent expressions for the mc provide a precise description of the mc in terms of the magnetic flux .",
    "a _ positive _ mc , with a saturation value slightly larger than twice the mc at zero field , is observed when turning on the field @xmath0 . in 2d , the saturated value of the magnetic field @xmath17",
    "( i.e. , the first field that makes the mc become twice the value at zero field ) is inversely proportional to twice the hopping length : the larger the system is , the smaller @xmath17 will be .",
    "in other words , as soon as the system , with hopping distance @xmath2 , is penetrated by a total flux of @xmath18 , the mc reaches the saturation value .",
    "the period of oscillation of the mc is found to be equal to @xmath1 , which is the superconducting flux quantum .",
    "furthermore , at very small fields , for two sites diagonally separated a distance @xmath2 , the mc scales as follows : ( i ) @xmath19 for quasi-1d ladder - type geometries with @xmath5 , ( ii ) @xmath20 in 2d with @xmath5 , ( iii ) @xmath19 in 3d with @xmath0 parallel to the @xmath7 direction , and ( iv ) @xmath20 in 3d with @xmath0 perpendicular to the @xmath7 direction .",
    "the general expressions presented here : ( i ) _ contain , as particular cases _ , several qi results@xcite derived during the past decade ( often by using either numerical or approximate methods ) , ( ii ) include qi to arbitrary points @xmath21 on a square lattice , instead of only diagonal sites @xmath22 , ( iii ) focus on 2d _ and _ 3d lattices , and ( iv ) can be extended to also include _ backward _ excursions ( e.g. , side windings ) in the directed paths .",
    "exact results in this class of directed - paths problems are valuable and can be useful when studying other systems , for instance : ( 1 ) directed polymers in a disordered substrate ( see , e.g. , refs .  12 and 13 ) , ( 2 ) interfaces in 2d ( see , for instance , ref .",

    "the transition amplitude ( green s function ) @xmath15 between these two states can be expressed as@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the sum over phases of the bonds on the path @xmath32 of @xmath33 steps connecting sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in general",

    "this directed - path model provides an excellent approximation to @xmath15 since @xmath36 is quite small in the extremely localized regime.@xcite it is important to stress that the _ conductivity_@xcite between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "quantum interference , contained in @xmath38 , arises because the phase factors of different paths connecting the initial and final sites interfere with each other .",
    "we will first focus on the computation of @xmath39 , which is the essential qi quantity for electrons deep in the localized regime .",

    "it will be shown later ( in section  iii ) that the effect of a magnetic field on the mc is governed by the behavior of @xmath39 . as a step towards the understanding of interference between",

    "iii , we investigate the tunneling in a random impurity potential , which is relevant to the conductivity of , for example , lightly doped semiconductors and strongly disordered compounds.@xcite closed - form results for the tunneling probability , which determines the conductivity , are obtained .",
    "we then analytically compute the moments for the tunneling probability . from them , we derive analytic field - dependent expressions , valid in any dimension , for the mc .",
    "the full behavior of the mc as a function of the magnetic flux  including the scaling in the low - field limit and the occurrence of saturation is discussed in detail .",
    "the close relationship between the qi quantity @xmath39 and the corresponding mc is illustrated .",

    "we show how the interference patterns and the small - field behavior of the mc vary according to the orientation of the applied field .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the effect on the low - flux mc due to the randomness the angles between the directions of the critical hops and the orientation of the applied field .    in sec .",
    "v , we conclude by addressing several relevant issues and summarize our results .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the site coordinates . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose @xmath41 to be the initial site and focus on @xmath42 . for forward - scattering paths of @xmath2 steps , which exclude backward excursions ( i.e. , only moving upward and to the right is allowed ) , ending sites @xmath21 satisfy @xmath43 .",

    "this could potentially be very useful .    in summary , we present an investigation of quantum interference phenomena and the magnetic - field effects on the mc resulting from sums over directed paths on resistor networks in 2d and 3d .",
    "the principal results include : ( 1 ) an exact and explicit closed - form expression for the sum over forward - scattering paths @xmath39 to any site on a square lattice , which is the essential qi quantity in both uniform and disordered cases , ( 2 ) an explicit formula for @xmath39 for electrons hopping on a cubic lattice , ( 3 ) the low - flux behaviors of @xmath39 in both 2d and 3d , ( 4 ) the exact summation of the dominant winding paths in 2d , ( 5 ) compact , analytic results for the positive mc as explicit functions of the magnetic flux which are valid in any dimension , ( 6 ) the small - field behaviors of the mc in quasi-1d , 2d and 3d , and ( 7 ) an analytic result for the small - field mc in 3d incorporating the randomness in the relative angles between the hops and the applied field .",
