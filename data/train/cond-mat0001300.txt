    "a carbon nanotube is a cylindrical tubule formed by wrapping a graphene sheet .",
    "single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) can be synthesized in structures @xmath0 nm in diameter and microns long @xcite .",
    "there has been particular interest in the electronic properties of swnts which are predicted to exist in both conducting and semiconducting forms @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it is possible to probe this behavior experimentally by contacting individual tubes with lithographically patterned electrodes or by tunneling spectroscopy on single tubes @xcite .",
    "however , most methods for synthesizing carbon nanotubes do not produce isolated tubes ; instead the tubes self assemble to form a hierarchy of more complex structures . at the molecular scale tubes pack together to form bundles or  ropes \" which can contain 10 - 200 tubes .",
    "x - ray diffraction reveals that a bundle contains tubes close packed in a triangular lattice @xcite , and measurements of the lattice constant and tube form factor led initially to the suggestion that these ropes contain primarily ( 10,10 ) nanotubes , a species predicted to be metallic @xcite .",
    "subsequent work has demonstrated that the ropes likely contain a distribution of tube diameters and chiralities @xcite . on larger scales the ropes bend and entangle , so that the macroscopic morphology of a carbon nanotube sample is that of an entangled mat .",
    "carbon nanotubes are also formed in various thick multiwalled species which exhibit their own unique electronic behavior @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of isolated swnts are controlled by the tube s wrapping vector , curvature and torsion @xcite .",
    "however , in ropes and in multiwalled tubes the interactions _ between _ graphene surfaces is expected to play a major role .",
    "this is the case even for crystalline graphite in the bernal structure .",
    "although an isolated graphene sheet is a zero gap semiconductor , the small residual interactions between neighboring graphene sheets with the ordered @xmath1-@xmath2 stacking sequence lead to a small overlap of bands near the fermi energy and eventually to conducting behavior @xcite .",
    "graphite is an ordered three dimensional crystal for which weak intersurface interactions are sufficient to establish quantum coherence for electronic states on neighboring sheets .",
    "thus the electrons can delocalize both parallel to the graphene sheet and perpendicular to it .    recognizing this , several groups have attempted to estimate the energy scale for similar effects in nanotube ropes @xcite . here",
    "the situation is much more delicate , since the structure of a ( 10,10 ) nanotube does not permit perfect registry between neighboring tubes when they are packed into a triangular lattice .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to construct a nanotube crystal , a hypothesized ordered structure in which each ( 10,10 ) tube adopts the same orientation , and to study its electronic properties with conventional band theoretic methods @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies on nanotube ropes show that intertube interactions in a nanotube crystal lead to a mixing of forward and backward propagating electronic states near the fermi energy .",
    "the level repulsion between these branches leads to suppression or",
    " pseudogap \" in the electronic density of states , on an energy scale estimated to be a few tenths of an electron volt .",
    "it should be noted that these effects are qualitatively different from those found in graphite where intersurface interactions lead to band _ overlap _ and thus an enhancement of the fermi level density of states .",
    "it has not yet been possible to extend these ideas to carbon nanotube ropes which contain a mixture of tubes with various diameters and chiralities . a direct calculation of the electronic structure for such a rope , which we define as  compositionally disordered , \" is quite complicated since the system has no translational symmetry either along the rope axis or perpendicular to it .    in this paper",
    "we develop a tight binding theory for the coupling between tubes . in the absence of intertube coupling the electronic states on an isolated tube",
    "are essentially the bloch waves of the graphene sheet wrapped onto the surface of a cylinder and indexed by a two dimensional crystal momentum * k*. the essence of our theory is to develop the effects of intertube interactions @xmath3 perturbatively .",
    "we find that the effects of intertube interactions in a disordered rope are quite different from what one obtains for a crystalline rope .",
    "in fact , we find that compositional disorder introduces an important energy barrier to inter - tube hopping within a rope so that intertube coherence is strongly suppressed . we are led to conclude that eigenstates in a compositionally disordered rope are strongly localized on individual tubes , though they can extend over large distances along the tube direction .",
    "numerical results illustrating this effect will be presented in this paper .",
    "we believe this physics underlies the experimental observation that charge transport at low temperature occurs by hopping conduction in nanotube ropes and mats .    in section ii",
    "we develop the tunneling model for describing the tight binding coupling between neighboring tubes in a rope . in this section",
    "we derive an analytic expression giving the tunneling amplitude @xmath4 between bloch states on neighboring tubes indexed by momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in section iii",
    "we apply the method to study the electronic structure of a rope crystal , and show that the model reproduces well the results of more complete band theoretic calculations on this ordered system . in section iv we then extend the method to study the low energy electronic structure in a _ compositionally disordered _ rope and analyze the effects of intertube interactions perturbatively",
    ". we will also present direct numerical calculations on a compositionally disordered rope which probe the transverse localization of the electronic states . a brief discussion of the relation of these results to experimental data is given in section v.",
    "in this section we derive an effective tight binding model which describes the coupling between the low energy electronic states on neighboring tubes .",
    "this coupling depends on the chirality and orientation of the tubes .",
    "our starting point is a microscopic tight binding model which describes the coupling of the carbon @xmath7 orbitals both within a tube and between tubes , @xmath8 @xmath9 is a nearest neighbor tight binding model describing uncoupled tubes , @xmath10 where the index @xmath11 labels the tubes and @xmath12 is a sum over nearest neighbor atoms on each tube .",
    "tunneling between tubes is also represented by @xmath13 in the following we will assume that @xmath14 depends on the positions and relative orientations of the @xmath7 orbitals on the @xmath15 and @xmath16 atoms .",

    "the eigenstates may be indexed by a tube index @xmath11 and a two dimensional momentum @xmath17 .",
    "of course the periodic boundary conditions imposed by wrapping the graphene sheet into a cylinder will give a constraint on the possible values of @xmath17 . in the following ,",
    "we wish to express the hamiltonian in terms of this plane wave basis .",
    "we will focus on eigenstates with low energy , which have @xmath17 near one of the corners of the graphite brillouin zone .",

    "we may express the sum over the @xmath48 s as a sum over equivalent @xmath50 points which are related to @xmath36 by a reciprocal lattice vector . in the following we will see that this sum is dominated by the @xmath36 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which lie in the  first star \" in reciprocal space . since @xmath53 , the sum becomes @xmath54 with @xmath55    we shall also find it useful to express the tunneling hamiltonian in a basis in which the bare hamiltonian describing the tubes is diagonal .",
    "this is accomplished by performing a rotation in the sublattice index space to make ( 2.9 ) diagonal .",
    "specifically , for a tube with chiral angle @xmath56 , the eigenstates will have momentum @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "equation ( 2.9 ) is then @xmath59 using the transformation @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the hamiltonian becomes @xmath62 in the @xmath63 basis , the tunneling matrix has the form @xmath64 which may be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66,\\ ] ] @xmath67 and @xmath68      for simplicity , we suppose that the matrix elements @xmath69 for tunneling between atoms on different tubes depend only on the distance between the atoms and are of the form , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the distance between atoms @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    it is useful to introduce two dimensional coordinates which are oriented relative to the tube s axis",

    "the gaussian form allows this to be done simply . using the fact that the total area of the graphene sheet is given by @xmath84 , we find @xmath85 we now use ( 2.27 ) to evaluate the low energy tunneling matrix elements . due to the exponential dependence on @xmath86",
    "the sum on @xmath87 in ( 2.11 ) will be dominated by three terms @xmath88 in the  first star \" in which @xmath89 . specifically , estimating the parameters @xmath90  , @xmath91  and @xmath92  , the exponent of the last term is approximately @xmath93 .",

    "for @xmath96 we then have @xmath97 with @xmath98 using ( 2.27 ) we then arrive at a final expression for the tunneling matrix element relating eigenstates on two tubes . @xmath99",
    "the tunneling model described above may be used to describe the coupling between flat graphene sheets . since the transverse bandwidth of graphite is well known ,",
    "this allows us to estimate the prefactor @xmath100 in the tunneling matrix element .",
    "the coupling between two flat graphene sheets is described by the @xmath101 limit of the above theory . in this case , the gaussian dependence on @xmath102 can be written as a ( kronecker ) delta function : @xmath103 we thus obtain @xmath104 with @xmath105    for this calculation , we find it most convenient to use the sublattice basis for the electronic eigenstates .",
    "using ( 2.27 ) the tunneling hamiltonian for two graphene sheets is then , @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "for @xmath109 stacking of graphite , @xmath110 , so , using @xmath111 the only nonzero term is @xmath112 thus tunneling only connects the @xmath1 sublattice on the `` a '' sheet to the @xmath2 sublattice on the `` b '' sheet .",
    "this is to be expected , since an atom on the @xmath2 sublattice of the `` a '' sheet sits above a hexagon on the `` b '' sheet .",
    "the hamiltonian for an @xmath109 stacked crystal of graphene planes then has the form , @xmath113 where @xmath114 indexes the graphene sheets .",
    "this can be simplified by introducing a transformation which interchanges the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sublattices of the graphene lattice when @xmath115 , followed by a transformation which interchanges the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sublattice on the odd @xmath116 graphene layers .",

    "this leads to an estimate @xmath121 ev .    comparing ( 2.29 ) and ( 2.33 )",
    "we may relate the tube tunneling matrix element to that of graphite , @xmath122 for a tube with radius @xmath123 we find @xmath124",
    "we now apply the tunneling model described above to the problem of the electronic structure of nanotube ropes .",

    "a compositionally disordered rope contains a random distribution of chiral tubes .",
    "since tubes with different chiralities have different periodicities , bloch s theorem is of little use for describing the eigenstates of the entire rope .",
    "nonetheless , in the absence of coupling between the tubes , we know that the eigenstates on each tube are plane waves . our approach is to describe the coupling between these plane waves perturbatively .",
    "we begin by considering the simpler problem of the electronic structure of two coupled nanotubes of different chirality .",
    "the electronic coupling between two tubes of different chirality conserves the momentum along the tube up to reciprocal lattice vectors in either tube .",
    "as we have argued in section ii , the sum over reciprocal lattice vectors is dominated by the terms in which @xmath138 are near the first star of @xmath139 points .",
    "when the coupling between the tubes is weak , it is useful to view this as _ momentum conserving _ coupling between states located near the three equivalent @xmath139 points .",
    "it must be kept in mind that two states @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the vicinity of different @xmath139 s are actually the same state .",
    "5 shows the brillouin zones of two nanotubes with chiral angles @xmath142 and @xmath143 oriented so that the @xmath144 and @xmath145 axes coincide . since the tunneling",
    "hamiltonian conserves @xmath146 , it is convenient to view the band structure of the pair of tubes as a function of @xmath146 .",
    "consider first the band structure in the absence of coupling .",
    "the solid bands describe the low energy states on one tube , while the dotted ones show the states on the other tube .",
    "each set of bands is replicated three times , reflecting the three equivalent @xmath139 points . in fig .",
    "6 we show the band structure in the vicinity of the fermi points with the minimum momentum mismatch , for the uncoupled system(fig .",
    "6a ) , and for the couple one(fig .",
    "to lowest order , the effect of the coupling is only important near points of degeneracy , i.e. where we have band crossing .",
    "this occurs in two cases .",
    "the first , which we refer to as a  backscattering gap \" occurs when the right and left moving bands on each tube cross .",
    "the second , which we refer to as a  tunneling gap \" occurs when the left moving band on one tube crosses the right moving band on the other tube .",
    "= 2.3 in    the effect of the coupling depends on two crucial energy scales : ( 1 ) the tunneling matrix element , @xmath147 , which we estimated in ( 2.27 ) to be less than 7.5 mev , and ( 2 ) the energy mismatch @xmath148,\\ ] ] which determines the energy at which the right and left moving bands on tubes @xmath11 and @xmath42 cross . in general , this energy mismatch depends on the chiral angles @xmath142 and @xmath143 of the two tubes as well as the fermi point indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in fig .",
    "7 we show the variation of the energy mismatch @xmath149 with the tube chirality for all the metallic tubes with diameters between @xmath150 nm .",
    "tubes which are mirror images to one another have the same diameter and energy difference .",
    "the offset of the @xmath20 momentum is taken at a zigzag tube ; in that case an ( 18,0 ) tube . as we see",
    "the typical energy mismatch is a few hundred mev .",
    "the fact that @xmath151 simplifies the problem considerably and justifies our perturbative approach .",
    "of course it breaks down in special cases when @xmath149 is zero or very small , which occurs , for instance when the two tubes are mirror images of each other .",
    "= 4.0 in    = 3.0 in    the tunneling hamiltonian couples left and right movers in first order , and therefore the tunneling gap is linear in the tunneling strength @xmath147 .",
    "the gap opens at @xmath152 and since @xmath147 is much smaller than @xmath149 , one concludes that tube - tube coupling has a small effect near the fermi energy .",
    "backscattering gaps form through second order coupling between left and right movers on the same tube , and hence the gap is second order in the tunneling strength ; @xmath153 , which is of order @xmath0 mev . furthermore , because the tunneling matrix elements are not invariant under the interchange of the two tubes , the backscattering gap of each tube opens at a different energy .",
    "this means that the effect on the density of states near the fermi energy is weakened by the wiggling of the gaps . in what follows ,",
    "we present quantitative arguments justifying our expectations .",
    "we focus first on the tunneling gaps . the movers on each tube couple in first order .",
    "in general , crossing occurs at three different energies , as dictated by the momentum mismatch between the fermi points of the two tubes(see fig . 5 ) .",
    "since we are ultimately interested in the effect of tube interactions on the states nearest to the fermi level , we only consider points with the lowest lying crossing .",
    "we denote these by @xmath154 and @xmath155 . to find the magnitude of the gaps and their offsets we need to diagonalize the first order perturbation matrix .",
    "we thus consider the hamiltonian which couples the right moving states on tube @xmath11 with the left moving states on tube @xmath42 , and we diagonalize the matrix @xmath156,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is measured from the fermi point of tube @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath157 the magnitude of the tunneling gap is @xmath158 it is centered about an energy @xmath159 above the fermi energy .",
    "notice that the @xmath160 sign in the argument of the exponential is due to the fact that the tubes face each other from the outside . as we see from fig .",
    "7 , the average energy separation @xmath161 mev , whereas the tunneling gap @xmath162 mev .",
    "this means that in a rope with a random distribution of chiralities , the opening of such gaps will have a negligible effect near the fermi level .",
    "now we focus on the backscattering gaps which form near the fermi level .",
    "since the left and right moving states on the same tube do not couple in first order , we use second order degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "we are interested in calculating the size of the resulting gap as well as the offset of the gap . in order to calculate these",
    ", we need to diagonalize the matrix which arises from the second order coupling between the states .",
    "in general , we have tunneling between all fermi points on each tube . since the magnitude of the backscattering gaps varies quadratically with the tunneling strength and inversely with the energy difference @xmath149 , the most effective contributions are those with the highest tunneling strength and lowest @xmath149 .",
    "this argument makes us only include the set of nearest @xmath139 points .",
    "therefore , we diagonalize @xmath163,\\ ] ] where @xmath164}{v(\\alpha_a { \\bf k}_{a \\ell_a } - \\alpha_b   { \\bf k}_{b \\ell_b})_{u}}\\bigg|_{{\\bf q}_a=0},\\ ] ] and @xmath165 .",
    "diagonalizing , we get @xmath166 the backscattering gap is @xmath167 , and it opens around an energy offset @xmath168 .",
    "we thus find @xmath169 and @xmath170    eqs(4.7 ) and ( 4.8 ) show that , in general , the gap offset @xmath171 is greater than the gap @xmath172 .",
    "in addition , one expects that the offsets and gaps of both tubes will generally be different .",
    "this means that the gaps wiggle around the fermi energy as the chiral angle is changed , leading to the conclusion that in a rope formed of a random collection of chiralities , the effect on the density of states around @xmath173 is very small .",
    "let us now have a closer look at the contributions of different tunneling points .",
    "in general , only one set of fermi points will dominate , unless the tubes are mirror images of each other .",
    "we now argue that in a case when the tubes have different chiralities , it is a certain set of fermi points that is actually important .",
    "we want to understand which tubes significantly couple to each other , and for those tubes , the fermi points at which the coupling is most effective . to do this",
    ", we study the quantity @xmath174 this quantity will be dominated by the exponential factor , and in cases where different sets of points have nearly equal exponential contribution , the denominator will dominate .    for nearly armchair tubes ,",
    "the maximum is at @xmath175 , i.e. , around the @xmath36 points(@xmath176 tunneling ) . in that case , the exponential factor is approximately @xmath0 , and the denominator takes it minimum value(@xmath177 mev ) as the two @xmath178 s are closest to zero . as the tubes shift from being armchair",
    ", the denominator increases as the fermi points rotate away from the @xmath20 axis , thereby making the tunneling less effective .    for tubes which are nearly mirror images of each other ,",
    "the dominant set is also the @xmath176 . while moving away from the armchair region",
    "does not significantly change the exponential contribution , it makes the denominator bigger , hence making the coupling less important .    for tubes which are nearly zigzag(but are not mirror images of each other ) , tunneling is the least effective , as both the exponential argument and the denominator are big . in some of these cases ,",
    "@xmath176 tunneling may not be the dominant one .",
    "we thus conclude that tunneling is most effective between tubes which are nearly armchair , and that the @xmath176 tunneling is the most important one , and hence @xmath179(and similar sums ) are dominated by one term . in other words , the sum over reciprocal lattice vectors in the tunneling hamiltonian is dominated by a single term .",
    "if we ignore the other terms , then there is no reciprocal lattice vector sum , and the system effectively has translational invariance in the direction parallel to the tubes .",
    "this  dominant fermi point approximation \" simplifies our problem considerably , since it allows us to assign a conserved momentum to each state .",
    "this will allow us to compute the band structure for an entire rope in the following section .",
    "in this section we study the electronic structure of a nanotube rope composed of tubes with a random distribution of diameters and chiralities .",
    "we expect that the momentum mismatch between the fermi points of neighboring tubes will suppress the tunneling and lead to localization . in real ropes",
    ", we expect @xmath180 of the tubes to be semiconducting . as indicated in fig .",
    "8 , this will make the localization effects even stronger . to emphasize our point",
    ", we consider a compositionally disordered rope with only metallic tubes .",
    "= 3.0 in    to solve the problem , we employ the `` dominant fermi point approximation '' introduced in the preceding section . in this approximation ,",
    "the momentum @xmath181 is conserved by the tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "we may thus write @xmath182 with @xmath183 and @xmath184 where @xmath185is the tunneling matrix given by @xmath186.\\ ] ]    the hamiltonian may now be diagonalized for each @xmath187 by diagonalizing a @xmath188 matrix , where @xmath24 is the number of tubes in the rope . for each @xmath187 , the @xmath189 eigenstate may be described by a `` wavefunction '' @xmath190 , which is the amplitude for the particle to be in state @xmath191 , @xmath23 on tube @xmath15 .",
    "a portion of the band structure of the metallic rope is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that there is no significant change in the vicinity of the fermi energy . as we have argued before the backscattering gaps wiggle around the fermi energy , thereby negligibly changing the density of states , which is shown in fig",
    "therefore , no pseudo gap develops .",
    "= 4.0 in    the extent of localization of the eigenstates may be quantitatively measured by computing the correlation function @xmath192 at the fermi energy , where @xmath193 is the position of tube @xmath15 in the rope . as shown in fig .",
    "10 , the correlation function decays exponentially with distance , @xmath194 , indicating that the eigenstates are localized perpendicular to the tube axes with a localization length @xmath195 .",
    "thus the eigenstates are predominantly on a single tube .    = 3.0 in",
    "in this paper we have shown that the constraints of energy and crystal momentum conservation severely restrict the electronic coupling between carbon nanotubes .",
    "the electronic coupling between two nanotubes is only effective when the eigenstates near the fermi energy have the same momentum , which requires that the graphene sheets of the two nanotubes are oriented parallel to one another .",
    "this only occurs when the two tubes are mirror images of one another .",
    "thus , in contrast to a crystalline rope of armchair nanotubes , in which eigenstates are extended throughout the rope , we find that the electronic eigenstates of a compositionally disordered rope are strongly localized on individual nanotubes .",
    "this conclusion has important consequences for the transport properties of nanotube ropes .",
    "in particular , it provides a natural explanation of the nonlocal effects observed by bockrath et al .",
    "@xcite in their multi - terminal conductance measurements .",
    "these effects can arise when different electrical leads make contact to different tubes within a rope , allowing the current in a tube to  bypass \" an electrical lead which it does not contact .    in the absence of impurities",
    ", the eigenstates will be localized on a single tube , but extend across the entire length of a tube .",
    "scattering , either due to impurities or tube ends , will tend to localize the states in the tube direction .",
    "paradoxically , by relaxing the constraint of momentum conservation such scattering will _ increase _ the coupling between tubes .",
    "nonetheless , we are led to a picture of _ highly anisotropic _ localization .",
    "this picture may help to explain some apparently paradoxical transport data on nanotube mats . at low temperatures , nanotube mats",
    "are observed to obey the three dimensional mott variable range hopping law , @xmath196 , with @xmath197 of order 100 k @xcite .",
    "if one uses the standard formula for _ isotropic _ variable range hopping and knowledge of the nanotube s density of states , one extracts a localization length of order @xmath198 .",
    "by contrast , fuhrer et al .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the scaling of the hopping conductivity with electric field and temperature @xmath199 , and have argued that the localization length is much longer , of order 6000 .",
    "our picture of anisotropic localization offers a possible resolution to this discrepancy . in the simplest model of anisotropic variable range hopping , @xmath197 depends on the _ geometric mean _ of the localization lengths , @xmath200 , while the scaling with electric field depends on the _ longest _ localization length , @xmath201 .    in this paper",
    ", we have developed a general framework for describing the electronic coupling between graphene based structures .",
    "this approach should prove useful for other problems , including the coupling between neighboring shells of multiwalled tubes as well as the coupling between crossed single walled tubes .",
    "analysis of these problems will be left for future work .",
    "in this appendix , we work out explicitly the fourier transform in section iia . as shown in fig .",
    "1 the positions of the lattice may be written as @xmath202 , which may be specified by a lattice vector @xmath203 , and a sublattice index @xmath204 .",
    "the position of the center of the hexagon is given by @xmath205 .",
    "consider first a sum over lattice sites of the form @xmath206 the sum over @xmath203 may be performed by introducing reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath207 , @xmath208 defining the fourier transform , @xmath209 we may then write @xmath210    a. thess et al .",

    "<S> we present a tight binding theory to analyze the motion of electrons between carbon nanotubes bundled into a carbon nanotube rope . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is developed starting from a description of the propagating bloch waves on ideal tubes , and the effects of intertube motion are treated perturbatively in this basis . </S>",
    "<S> expressions for the interwall tunneling amplitudes between states on neighboring tubes are derived which show the dependence on chiral angles and intratube crystal momenta . </S>",
    "<S> we find that conservation of crystal momentum along the tube direction suppresses interwall coherence in a carbon nanorope containing tubes with random chiralities . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations are presented which indicate that electronic states in a rope are localized in the transverse direction with a coherence length corresponding to a tube diameter . </S>"
