    "the multiferroic domain inversion in mnwo@xmath0  is rather slow , of the order of milliseconds to a few tens of milliseconds indicating that the domains in the multiferroic state are well pinned .",
    "this is in accordance with the large coercive fields found in the quasi - static experiments @xcite .",
    "the slow multiferroic rise times underline the importance of the lattice in the control of domains . for a purely structural domain",
    "the finite sound velocity can limit the speed of domain inversion to below the quotient of thickness to sound velocity ( of the order of @xmath56s for a mm sized crystal ) , but this is not the limiting factor in mnwo@xmath0 . that we observe three orders of magnitude larger rise times indicates effective pinning .",
    "our neutron experiment senses the chiral magnetic component that could in principle be decoupled from the total ferroelectric polarization during the domain inversion . the good agreement between the magnetic response and the dielectric one",
    "@xcite clearly excludes such decoupling .",
    "furthermore we always find a single relaxation ; there is no indication for some faster magnetic relaxation preceding slower ferroelectric domains .",
    "this documents once more , that magnetism and ferroelectric polarization are strongly coupled in mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "the precise reason for the slow domain inversion remains unclear .",
    "since only tiny atomic displacements can be associated with the observed small ferroelectric polarization , it seems unlikely that strong pinning arises due to these purely ferroelectric displacements .",
    "instead higher - order modulations appear more likely to be at the origin of the strong pinning . for a magnetic modulation",
    "one can always expect a coupling with a structural modulation of half the magnetic period . in reference @xcite it was shown , that this half - period structural modulation is sizeable in mnwo@xmath0  and that it is accompanied by a second - order modulation of the magnetic structure .",
    "the two modulations exhibit coherent interference underlining their tight coupling @xcite .",
    "this structural distortion can possess a higher pinning potential than the weak ferroelectric distortion itself .",
    "it is quite astonishing that domains switch again much faster when approaching the lower boundary of the multiferroic phase .",
    "since this transition is of clear first order , one would not expect any slowing down of excitations , which could melt the pinning .",
    "instead the lower transition is related to the anharmonic distortions of the magnetic modulation , which increase upon cooling in the multiferroic phase @xcite .",
    "this increase is relatively stronger than that of the first - order magnetic modulation .",
    "increasing anharmonicity may result in some depinning .",
    "after this first series of experiments we tried to investigate whether we could change the preferred chirality by reversing the field during cooling .",
    "we heated the sample to 20k and cooled it in a field of @xmath57 .",
    "then we recorded the switching behavior in a temperature range from 12.5k to 7.5k .",
    "three curves at different temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "[ umgepolt ] .",
    "as expected the sample now has a preference to negative chirality what is in accordance with the field applied during cooling . comparing the fit parameters of the two temperature runs ( fig .  [ werteschalten ] with fig .",
    "[ werteumgepolt ] ) reveals reversed behavior .",
    "now the negative chirality exceeds the positive chirality",
    ". however the positive ( not preferred ) chirality shows a less smooth curve than before because the full saturation is not reached at all temperatures .",
    "the behavior of the time constants is also reversed .",
    "now the time needed to switch to the positive chirality exceeds the time needed to switch to the negative chirality .",
    "we also observe that the rise time to switch to not preferred chirality became longer than that observed in the first series .    the reversal of the preferred orientation agrees with the pronounced memory effects reported in reference @xcite .",
    "most likely the cooling with a large electric field freezes in some local fields which determine the preferential orientation of the multiferroic domains .",
    "this leads to the strong asymmetries in the hysteresis cycles as well as in the time dependence of domain reversion .",
    "the time - resolved measurement was repeated at the in14 spectrometer at the ill with a crystal grown in a different batch , in order to investigate which properties were specific to the sample and which ones are general .",
    "the second sample was 0.89 mm thick .",
    "for this experiment we used a conventional helmholtz setup for the polarization analysis as it provides a higher scattering intensity , and as the chiral component can be studied in the longitudinal @xmath41 channel .",
    "the intensity of the magnetic reflection @xmath58 amounts to 1400 cnts / s , i.e.comparable to the first experiment in spite of the smaller sample volume .",

    "k a negative field of @xmath59 kv / mm was applied yielding a saturation value of the chiral ratio of 0.85 which is significantly higher than that for the first sample and indicates an almost perfect monodomain state ( 95% , comparable to earlier studies @xcite ) . nevertheless , the hysteresis loop is not perfectly symmetric but shows a clear preference for negative electric polarization which corresponds to the first field the crystal sensed after cooling .",
    "crystals thus possess some intrinsic preference for the multiferroic state , whose origin requires further clarification . for the time - dependent studies we chose a field of @xmath291.35 kv / mm , which is sufficiently above the coercive fields in both directions .    .",

    "[ in14fit ] . in this",
    "run the sample develops a clear preference for negative fields and shows more asymmetric behavior .",
    "the sign of the asymmetry agrees with the one observed after zero - field cooling of the virgin crystal and therefore seems to be intrinsic to this crystal .",
    "the rise times in the favorable negative field direction of this run are faster than those in the previous run , and the rise times in the unfavorable positive field direction are even slower than the previous ones .",
    "so , the field - cooling in negative fields seems to enhance the natural asymmetry of this crystal , while field - cooling in the opposite field seems to reduce it thereby yielding an almost symmetric state .",
    "however , all the general aspects of the rise times with maximum times near 10  k are again observed . in this last run",
    "the rise times in the unfavorable direction became too long to reach saturation , therefore the amplitude in the unfavorable direction diminishes towards low temperatures and exhibits a minimum around 10  k.    the time - resolved data were again analyzed with the relaxation formula ( 2 ) .",
    "the exponents @xmath11 of the stretched exponentials could be fitted globally for all temperatures or individually without significant differences in the rise times ; they amount to 1.67/1.32 and 1.43/1.36 in the slow / fast switching processes in the first and second sequence , respectively , so that it actually is a compressed exponential behavior .",
    "although the stretching exponent clearly depends on sample history and on the direction of the field switch the average value agrees for the two samples and the various histories studied .",
    "the average stretching exponent is found at 1.4 .",
    "this exponent can be interpreted within the frame - work proposed by ishibashi and takagi @xcite .",
    "the exponent corresponds to the dimensionality of the domain growth enhanced by one for the case of constant continuous nucleation .",
    "therefore our data suggests a low - dimensional domain growth as it is typically observed in ferroelectrics . a distribution of pinning properties and of local rise times will decrease the fitted exponent thereby weakening the conclusion of one - dimensional domain growth , but a large exponent that is reduced by severe spread of rise times is inconsistent with our time domain data .",

    "the left panel shows the chiral amplitude of the hysteresis cycles , that could be controlled as function of temperatures ; the right panel shows the rise times of these hysteresis cycles as function of temperature for the two direction of electric - field inversion .",
    "empty symbols belong to the repeated measurement and proof the reproducibility of the data . in total four temperature dependencies of the rise time",
    "were performed corresponding to an initial field cooling in positive or negative fields ( labelled by @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the legend ) and to relaxation in positive and negative fields , labelled by 1 and 2 , respectively . ]    in fig .",
    "[ in14fit ] the rise times and amplitudes of all measurements with the second setup are combined as function of temperature .",
    "qualitatively , these values agree with the results of the first experiment , see fig .",
    "[ werteschalten ] and [ werteumgepolt ] , but there is less difference between the up and down field directions and the rise times are slightly shorter in general .",
    "the controlled chiral component remains close to the ideal value over the entire temperature range in the second sample .",
    "also this sample shows the faster domain response when approaching the upper and the lower boundaries of the ferroelectric phase .",
    "additionally , the second sample displays a weak long - time - scale relaxation process which can be observed at 8 k and 10 k in fig .",
    "[ in14data ] .",
    "the main part of the chiral ration adapts to the new field in less than 10 ms , but then the chiral ratio still increases with a much lower time scale .",
    "this behavior was not observed with the other sample studied on in12 , which , however , could be switched to a lesser extent .",
    "due to the different initial poling ( parallel and antiparallel to the intrinsic preference of the crystal ) and due to the two field directions there are in total four different configurations to be considered for each of the two crystals , see the combined plot in the right panel of fig . 7 . if we average these four curves we determine rise times of 2.5 , 10.5 and 3.6  ms at 12 , 9.5 and 7.5k , respectively , for the second crystal , while the rise times of the first crystal amount to 3.6 , 15 , and 4.5  ms at the same temperatures .",
    "the slightly slower domain reversion ( roughly a factor 1.5 ) in the first crystal can be attributed to the lower applied field ( see discussion below ) so that the two sets of measurements agree quite well with each other . by averaging the four possible configurations one finds the intrinsic domain properties for this type of crystals .",
    "note , that the two crystals were obtained from different growth processes but using the same technique @xcite .      with the first experimental setup on in12 we investigated the influence of the amplitude of the switching field by applying 1.2 , 1.35 , and 1.5kv / mm with a constant repetition rate of 8  hz ,",

    "the difference for the three applied amplitudes can be easily analyzed : if we switch from the not preferred state to the preferred state ( i.e. the rapid process ) the field of 1.2kv / mm already largely exceeds the minimal required field ( i.e. the coercive field of the preferred state ) . the maximal chirality and",
    "the stretching exponents stay almost the same for all three fields , but the rise time diminishes with increasing electric field . if we switch into the not - preferred state more drastic changes occur as function of electric field .",
    "the domain distribution reaches lower saturation values at smaller fields , and , more importantly , the rise - times decrease more rapidly than the inverse of the electric field , see fig .",
    "this e - field dependence of the rise times allows us to overlay the multiferroic domain behavior in the two distinct crystals .",
    "in addition , we investigated the effect of the frequency on the switching behavior . at 10k we switched at the following frequencies ( chronological order ) : 10 , 12 , 5 , 8 , 20 , and 40hz .",

    "the rise times in our experiment , however , do not essentially change within the studied frequency range .    during the entire sequence of experiments with the first setup we realized that the sample exhibits some fatigue .",
    "we compare runs which were done at 10k and 8hz with different histories of the sample . as reference",
    "we use the run which was taken in the beginning of the measurement during the first temperature scan of rise - time experiments . at this first time the chirality could be flipped almost as large as in the static cycle ( + 0.49 , @xmath63 ) at @xmath64 , see fig .",

    ". however , the sample did not restore to its initial behavior .",
    "so we heated the sample to 120k in the hope that such procedure would restore the sample , however , this was not accomplished .",
    "the repeated switching seems to induce defects influencing magnetic and polar order which do not heal when going far beyond the magnetic phase transition . with the second setup",
    "no fatigue was observed , as described above .    .",
    "the system clearly shows a preferred state . at high frequencies the time is too short to reach saturation in the not - preferred state .",

    "in general the rise times to invert the magnetic components are slow , typically of the order of a few to several tens of milliseconds .",
    "this agrees with a measurement of second harmonic generation and in particular with a comprehensive study by dielectric spectroscopy .",

    "the peculiar temperature dependence of the rise times with a maximum around 10  k also is a general feature of the domain kinetics in mnwo@xmath0 . the faster response is naturally expected when approaching the upper phase transition , where ferroelectricity and the chiral components disappear continuously associated with softer excitations",
    ". however , the faster kinetics near the lower first - order phase transition is astonishing and possibly related to the increase of the anharmonic modulations upon cooling in the multiferroic phase .",
    "the second- and higher - order modulations of both , the nuclear and the crystal structure can be relevant for the effective pinning of domains in mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "the independent measurement on crystals of two different batches yield good agreement concerning the qualitative temperature dependence and even quantitative agreement when considering the average of the four possibilities of the electric field ( relaxation field and initial poling ) and taking the field strength into account .",
    "the sign and the size of the asymmetries , which are seen in the rise times , in the saturation chiral component or in the coercive fields , clearly are sample and history dependent . even after zero - field cooling",
    ", a finite asymmetry persists indicating an intrinsic property of the sample .",
    "field cooling from higher temperatures seems to imprint stronger polar preferences , which can be reverted @xcite by different thermal cycling .",

    "we thank j.  stein and j.  hemberger for valuable discussions .",
    "while there is perfect agreement concerning the upper two magnetic transition temperatures , the first order transition between af1 and af2 phases seems to slightly depend on the sample , see c. tlzer diploma thesis ( university of cologne 2012 , unpublished ) ."

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> the time dependence of switching multiferroic domains in mnwo@xmath0 has been studied by time - resolved polarized neutron diffraction . inverting an external electric field inverts the chiral magnetic component within rise times ranging between a few and some tens of milliseconds in perfect agreement with macroscopic techniques . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence for any faster process in the inversion of the chiral magnetic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the time dependence is well described by a temperature - dependent rise time suggesting a well - defined process of domain reversion . as expected , the rise times decrease when heating towards the upper boundary of the ferroelectric phase . however , switching also becomes faster upon cooling towards the lower boundary , which is associated with a first - order phase transition .    </S>",
