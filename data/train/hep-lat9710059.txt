    "our simulations are carried out for two flavors of quarks , mostly on a @xmath16 lattice .",

    "for the inversion of the fermion matrix we first used the mr algorithm but switched later to bicgstab .",

    "we employ the smearing procedure proposed in ref .",

    "our main results for the effect of improved actions on hadron masses are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : epn ] , in which the ratio @xmath23 is plotted as a function of @xmath24 for the four action combinations .",
    "the solid curve represents the well - known phenomenological mass formula @xcite .    for the standard action combination  ( upward triangles ) ,",
    "the ratios are well above the phenomenological curve .",
    "when we improve the gauge action ( the  case , shown by downward triangles ) , the data points come closer to the curve . by",
    "far the most conspicuous change , however , is observed when we introduce the clover term to the quark action .",
    "for both the  ( circles ) and  ( squares ) cases , the data points lie much nearer to , or on top of , the phenomenological curve .    looking only at fig .",
    "[ fig : epn ] , however , is misleading because the runs for different action combinations are performed at slightly different lattice spacings . in fig .  [",
    "fig : scaling ] we therefore show the @xmath25-dependence .",
    "we interpolate the ratios @xmath23 to a common , fixed ratio @xmath26 and plot @xmath23 vs. @xmath27 in lattice units , with @xmath27 also interpolated to @xmath26 .",
    "now it becomes clear that the better results for the  case are only due to a finer lattice spacing and that the  and  results seem to lie almost on the same curve .",
    "the results for the  and  cases with the mf or pmf choice of @xmath4 also lie on a common curve , which , however , is much flatter .",
    "somewhat less , but still quite substantial , improvement is found for the tree level @xmath4 . the same trend is seen also at @xmath28 and for the ratio @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "changing the gluon and quark actions one at a time , we have been able to see clearly that the clover term plays a decisive role in improving the spectrum . in this regard , improving the gluon action has much less effect .",
    "another interesting feature in our hadron mass data is that they exhibit a negative curvature in terms of @xmath30 towards the chiral limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral ] we show this effect for the @xmath18 meson and nucleon masses using the  and  action combinations and several choices of @xmath4 .",
    "we also note that for the clover action the @xmath18 meson masses are shifted to a higher value compared to those for the wilson action . for the nucleon ,",
    "however , we see no difference between the wilson and clover cases . this confirms an earlier observation using staggered dynamical fermions@xcite .",
    "= 8.5 cm    improving the action is expected to lead to a dispersion relation closer to that in the continuum . as a measure for the closeness to the continuum",
    "we define the `` speed of light '' @xmath31 through @xmath32 .",
    "values of @xmath31 are extracted by a linear fit of @xmath33 to @xmath34 , using the three lowest momenta . in the continuum",
    "@xmath31 equals one for all values of the rest mass . on the lattice ,",
    "however , @xmath31 is only expected to go to one for vanishing rest mass . for nonzero rest mass",
    "it is generally different from one .",
    "an improved action is expected to have a `` speed of light '' closer to one for nonzero rest masses .",
    "our results for @xmath31 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2 ] .",
    "an improvement is most clearly seen in a comparison of the  and action combinations .",
    "we are not able to tell whether the improvement is due more to the gauge or quark action , however , since the  and  cases both also show signs of similar improved behavior within the present statistics .",
    "= 8.5 cm      the static quark potential provides a good measure of the effectiveness of improving the action in restoring the rotational symmetry . in the quenched case",
    "it is known that the symmetry is well restored by improving the gauge action@xcite .",
    "our typical results for full qcd taken for a quark mass corresponding to @xmath35 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcrv ] for each action combination .",
    "we see quite clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcrv ] that the symmetry is remarkably well restored by improving only the gauge action also in full qcd .",
    "the effect of quark action improvement on the restoration of the symmetry is not clear in our data .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the clover improvement does not remove terms of the wilson action breaking rotational symmetry , while the  action for gluons has much reduced coefficients for the rotationally variant terms compared to the plaquette action .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8 cm    another interesting question one can address with data for the static potential is whether the lattice scale determined from the string tension @xmath36 is consistent with that from the @xmath18 meson mass .",
    "we extract the string tension assuming the form @xmath37 .",
    "the coulomb coefficient @xmath38 is ill - determined with our data , which starts at a coarse distance of @xmath39  fm .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is generally the smallest , and use the shift of @xmath36 over the range @xmath42 as a systematic error .",
    "this fitting is repeated over several fitting ranges , and the average of the fitted results is taken as the central value of @xmath36 , while the variance is included into the systematic error . for estimating the lattice spacing we employ the phenomenological value @xmath43 .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : a ] we plot the lattice spacing obtained from the string tension and the @xmath18 meson mass for each value of @xmath3 for all four action combinations . for the @xmath18 meson mass the value in the chiral limit is also shown .",
    "let us emphasize that the consistency of the two determinations of the lattice scale is expected only in the chiral limit and sufficiently close to the continuum limit . from this point of view ,",
    "a significant discrepancy in the chiral limit between the two determinations , as observed in the  and  results , shows the presence of large scaling violating effects , originating from the wilson quark action , at @xmath44  gev .",
    "we expect the discrepancy to disappear closer to the continuum limit , and this is supported by the results obtained at @xmath45 with @xmath46  gev of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the two estimates of the lattice spacing converge well to a consistent result for the  and  cases .",
    "this shows that the clover term helps to improve the consistency of the two determinations of the lattice spacing already at @xmath47gev .      our results for the potential , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcrv ] , and covering distances up to @xmath48  fm , are quite linear in @xmath49 and do not show any sign of string breaking via @xmath50 pair creation . in order to search for this effect",
    ", we employ one of the  runs carried out on a @xmath51 lattice at @xmath52 with which we can measure the potential up to @xmath53 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vvsr16x32 ] , and still do not show any sign of deviation from a linear behaviour in @xmath49 .",
    "we find , however , that the maximum overlap of the ground state with the smeared wilson loop operator decreases as @xmath49 increases and falls down to about 50% at @xmath54  fm for our full qcd case , while effectively a 100% overlap is obtained for the quenched case , independent of the distance @xmath49 .",
    "this may be an indication that the ground state develops towards larger @xmath49 a mixing , absent in quenched qcd , with states containing @xmath50 pairs .",
    "a very interesting and important issue in simulations in full qcd is how close one can approach the chiral limit . of the four action combinations we have examined",
    ", the  combination exhibits the most improved behaviour with regard to the scaling of mass ratios and the rotational symmetry of the potential .",
    "we therefore choose this action combination for a feasibility study towards the chiral limit .",
    "the runs are made at @xmath52 on a @xmath55 lattice with a spatial size of about @xmath56  fm , and a quark mass corresponding to @xmath6 as small as @xmath57 is explored ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "results for the mass ratios obtained with 80260 configurations for each quark mass , which includes statistics accumulated after the conference ( especially for the lightest quark ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:16x32 ] .",
    "these results point towards the possiblity that , by improving both the fermion and the gauge action , continuum results in full qcd at small quark masses are achievable using the presently available computing power .",
