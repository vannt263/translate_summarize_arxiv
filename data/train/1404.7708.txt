    "entanglement of formation ( eof)@xcite and relative entropy of entanglement ( ree)@xcite are two major entanglement monotones for bipartite systems . for pure states @xmath0 the eof @xmath1 is defined as a von neumann entropy of its subsystem @xmath2 . on the contrary , ree is defined as minimum value of the relative entropy with separable states ; @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a set of separable states , it is called `` distance entanglement measure '' .",
    "another example of the distance entanglement measure is a geometric entanglement measure defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a maximal overlap of a given state @xmath7 with the nearest product state@xcite . ] .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that @xmath8 is a upper bound of the distillable entanglement@xcite .",
    "the separable state @xmath9 , which yields a minimum value of the relative entropy is called the closest separable state ( css ) of @xmath10 .",
    "surprising fact , at least for us , is that although definitions of eof and ree are completely different , they are exactly same for all pure states@xcite .",
    "this fact may indicate that they are related to each other although the exact connection is not revealed yet .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to explore the veiled connection between eof and ree .    for mixed states",
    "@xmath10 eof is defined via a convex - roof method@xcite ; @xmath11 where the minimum is taken over all possible pure - state decompositions with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the ensemble that gives the minimum value in eq.([two3 ] ) is called the optimal decomposition of the mixed state @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the main task for analytic calculation of eof is derivation of an optimal decomposition of the given mixture .",
    "few years ago , the procedure for construction of the optimal decomposition was derived@xcite in the two - qubit system , the simplest bipartite system , by making use of the time - reversal operation of spin-1/2 particles appropriately . in these references",
    "the relation @xmath14 is used , where @xmath15 is a binary entropy function @xmath16 and @xmath17 is called the concurrence .",
    "this procedure , usually called wootters procedure , was re - examined in ref.@xcite in terms of antilinearity .",
    "introduction of antilinearity in quantum information theory makes it possible to derive concurrence - based entanglement monotones for tripartite@xcite and multipartite systems@xcite . due to the discovery of the closed formula for eof in the two - qubit system ,",
    "eof is recently applied not only to quantum information theory but also to many scientific fields such as life science@xcite .    while eof is used in various areas of science",
    ", ree is not because of its calculational difficulty . in order to obtain ree",
    "analytically for given mixed state @xmath10 one should derive its css , but still we do nt know how to derive css@xcite even in the two - qubit system except very rare cases@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "ree for bell - diagonal , generalized vedral - plenio@xcite , and generalized horodecki states@xcite were derived analytically through pure geometric arguments@xcite .",
    "due to the notorious difficulty some people try to solve the ree problem conversely .",
    "let @xmath9 be a two - qubit boundary states in the convex set of the separable states . in ref.@xcite authors derived entangled states , whose css are @xmath9 .",
    "this converse procedure is extended to the qudit system@xcite and is generalized as convex optimization problems@xcite .",
    "however , as emphasized in ref.@xcite still it is difficult to find a css @xmath9 of given entangled state @xmath10 although the converse procedure may provide some useful information on the css@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will try to find a css for given entangled two - qubit state without relying on the converse procedure .",
    "as commented , eof and ree are identical for bipartite pure states although they are defined differently .",
    "this means that they are somehow related to each other .",
    "if this connection is unveiled , probably we can find css for arbitrary two - qubit mixed states because we already know how to compute eof through wootters procedure . to explore this issue",
    "is original motivation of this paper .",
    "we will show in the following that ree of many mixed symmetric states can be analytically obtained from eof if one follows the following procedure :    1 .   for entangled two - qubit state @xmath10",
    "let @xmath18 be an optimal decomposition for calculation of eof .",
    "since @xmath19 are pure states , it is possible to obtain their css @xmath20 .",
    "thus , it is straight to derive a separable mixture @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 is a boundary state in the convex set of separable states , the procedure is terminated with @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath22 is not a boundary state , we consider @xmath24 . by requiring",
    "that @xmath25 is a boundary state , one can fix @xmath26 , _ say _ @xmath27 .",
    "then we identify @xmath28 .",
    "this procedure is schematically represented in fig",
    ". 1 .    in order to examine the validity of the procedure we have to apply the procedure to the mixed states",
    "whose ree are already known .",
    "thus , we will choose the bell - diagonal , generalized vedral - plenio and generalized horodecki states , whose ree were computed in ref.@xcite through different methods .",
    "also , we will apply the procedure to the less symmetric mixed states such as vedral - plenio - type and horodecki - type states whose ree were computed in ref.@xcite by making use of the the converse procedure introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we show that the procedure generates the correct css for bell - diagonal states . in section",
    "iii and section iv we show that the procedure generates the correct css for generalized vedral - plenio and generalized horodecki states , respectively . in section",
    "v we consider two less symmetric states , vedral - plenio - type and horodecki - type states .",
    "it is shown that while the procedure generates a correct css for the former , it does not give a correct one for the latter .",
    "in section vi a brief conclusion is given .",
    "in appendix we prove that eof and ree are identical for all pure states by making use of the schmidt decomposition .",
