    "recent infrared observations have revealed the existence of a population of dense bright - star clusters in the galactic center region ( e.g. , @xcite ) , such as the arches cluster or the quintuplet cluster .",

    "further detailed observations of dense molecular clouds in the galactic center region may provide a key to understanding the physical properties of the clouds and their relationship to this star - forming mechanism .",
    "large - scale surveys in molecular lines have revealed that molecular clouds in the central @xmath7  100 pc of the galaxy are different from those in the galactic disk .",
    "for example , the incidence of relatively dense clouds is higher in the galactic center region .",
    "the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) cs survey has shown that density of most molecular clouds there is over @xmath8 @xcite . moreover , the multiline observations show that even the co - emitting region ( or outer envelope ) of a typical galactic center molecular cloud is under high pressure at @xmath9 @xcite .    among dense molecular clouds in the galactic center region , the molecular cloud g0.11@xmath30.110.11 in @xcite , and as the tuh shell in @xcite .",

    "it is located between sgr  a and the galactic center arc ( gca ) .",
    "the nro cs survey @xcite shows that g0.11@xmath30.11 is well separated in @xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath12 space from the main ridge of the cs emission , which is the central disk of molecular gas in the galactic center .",
    "the cs observations reveal that g0.11@xmath30.11 has a large molecular mass and large velocity width at the eastern and western edges of the cloud .",
    "the eastern edge appears to have an interaction with the gca @xcite .",
    "g0.11@xmath30.11 is bright at the x - ray fluorescent iron line @xcite , which suggests that dense gas in the cloud reflects x - rays from an intense source .",
    "the morphologies of g0.11@xmath30.11 in cs and co lines are similar .",
    "these lines are presumably optically thick at the surface of the cloud . to obtain the physical properties of the cloud ,",
    "observations in an optically thin line are required .",
    "the h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) line should be suitable because of its very low abundance . here",
    "we present the first view in an h@xmath0co@xmath1 line of g0.11@xmath30.11 , exploring the molecular gas distribution in the cloud . at the same time",
    ", we present a high - resolution view in thermal sio lines . the thermal sio lines are thought to be a good tracer of hot and shocked regions because this molecule is in gas phase only under high - temperature environment @xcite .",
    "for example , thermal sio emission is detected in bipolar flow sources and in shocked shells of supernova remnants .",
    "@xcite surveyed the galactic center region in the thermal sio line .",
    "however , they observed only half the extent of g0.11@xmath30.11 , and with poor angular resolution .",
    "we have now made observations of g0.11@xmath30.11 in these lines using the nobeyama 45 m telescope with much higher resolution .",
    "we have observed g0.11@xmath30.11 in april 2002 , using the nobeyama 45 m telescope , simultaneously observing at the spectral lines of h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 ( 86.754330 ghz ) , sio @xmath13 ( 43.423798 ghz ) , and sio @xmath14 ( 86.846998 ghz ) .",
    "the fwhm beam sizes at 43 and 86 ghz are 35   and 18 , respectively .",

    "the observed region is a rectangular area of @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , which covers the whole cloud .",

    "the main - beam efficiencies at 43 and 86 ghz are 0.81 and 0.50 , respectively .",
    "two sio maser sources , oh  2.6@xmath30.4 and vx sgr , were observed every hour in order to check the telescope pointing .",
    "typical pointing accuracy was 5   during this observation .",
    "we used acousto - optic spectrometers with 250 mhz bandwidth , of which the respective velocity resolutions at 43 and 86 ghz are 0.87 @xmath17 and 0.44 @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the line intensities were calibrated by the chopper wheel method @xcite in order to correct the antenna temperature for atmospheric attenuation , @xmath18 .",
    "the system temperatures during this observation were 300 k at 43 ghz and 500 k at 86 ghz .",
    "linear or parabolic baselines were applied to all the spectra .",
    "figure [ figintmap ] shows the integrated intensity maps in the three lines in the velocity range of @xmath19 .",
    "the spatial resolutions are adjusted to 45   by applying gaussian convolution .",
    "a shell - like molecular cloud is seen in all the three lines .",
    "the appearance in the sio lines resembles that in the cs @xmath2 line ( see fig .  1 of tsuboi et al .",
    ".    however , several differences are apparent in the images in the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 and sio lines .",
    "the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 intensity is significantly concentrated to the southern half of the cloud , although the cloud seems to extend beyond @xmath20 in sio and cs images . in the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 line ,",
    "the integrated intensity in @xmath21 is 80 % of the total intensity of the whole cloud , which is integrated over @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "these discrepancies are presumably due to the difference in optical depths between the sio and h@xmath0co@xmath1 lines ( see detail in   [ sec : nh ] ) .",
    "namely , the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 line intensity traces the column density , but the sio lines do not .",
    "thus , g0.11@xmath30.11 shows significant difference in column density below and above a front at @xmath24 .",
    "g0.11@xmath30.11 shows four distinctive features in these lines . along the eastern edge of the cloud",
    ", a prominent ridge is seen in all the three lines .",
    "we dub it the e ridge hereafter ( fig .",
    "[ figintmap ] , _ solid line _ ) . at @xmath25",
    ", it extends from @xmath26 to @xmath27 perpendicular to the galactic plane . on the northern end of the e ridge",
    ", a peak is seen in both the sio lines at @xmath28   ( hereafter peak a ) . at @xmath29 , another peak ( peak b )",
    "is seen in the sio lines .",

    "the fwhm in these figures is increased to be 45   by gaussian smoothing .",
    "typical rms noise levels in @xmath31 for h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 , sio @xmath2 , and @xmath32 lines are 0.042 k , 0.050 k , and 0.042 k , respectively .    the e ridge is seen in the sio channel maps between @xmath33 .",
    "the e ridge extends for 3   in galactic latitude , equivalent to 7 pc at a distance of 8.5  kpc .",
    "a corresponding feature is also seen in the cs line ( fig .  2 in tsuboi et al .",
    "the e ridge is extended in the direction parallel to the gca .",
    "this morphology may suggest an interaction of the molecular gas with the gca . however , this interaction is probably not very strong , if it exists , because the e ridge is not the most prominent feature in the sio image .    in the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2",
    "map the e ridge is also distinguishable , but less prominent than in the sio lines , and very weak in @xmath34 .",
    "the velocity structures of the e ridge in the sio and h@xmath0co@xmath1 lines are similar at @xmath35 .",
    "the sio emission is extended beyond @xmath36 , but the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 emission is not .",
    "we note that this extension of the e ridge in the sio emission connects at @xmath37 to the ridge extending at @xmath38 , which goes through peak b ( see fig .",
    "[ figh13co10_lv ] ) .",
    "peak a is seen in the sio maps between @xmath39 . at the high - redshift end , peak",
    "a is merged into the ridge along the galactic plane through peak b. in the sio line images , peak a appears to be somehow connected with the e ridge .",
    "however , the h@xmath0co@xmath1 line image shows no feature corresponding to peak a or b ( @xmath40 ) , whereas it seems to show the e ridge .",
    "hence , peak a is unlikely to be a part of the e ridge .",
    "peak b is seen in the sio maps at @xmath41 . beyond @xmath42",
    "the position of peak b is shifted northward by 20 . in the h@xmath0co@xmath1 map a clear counterpart",
    "is seen only beyond @xmath42 .",
    "this suggests that peak b may be a double source and separable at @xmath43 . in any case ,",
    "peak b with @xmath44 is only seen in the sio lines .",
    "peak c is seen in the range @xmath45 .",
    "the h@xmath0co@xmath1 map shows its counterpart clearly .",
    "peak c is morphologically connected to the e ridge in @xmath46 space . the e ridge and",
    "peak c might be two main parts of g0.11@xmath30.11 .",
    "another prominent ridge with @xmath37 at @xmath38 parallel to the galactic plane is seen in all the observed lines .",
    "the large - scale velocity structure observed in cs @xcite suggests that this ridge is a blueshifted wing of the main ridge of the galaxy through the whole galactic center region .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss this feature in this paper .      to evaluate the morphological resemblance among the sio lines and difference between the h@xmath0co@xmath1 and sio lines quantitatively , we estimate intensity ratios of observed lines , which are keys to determine the optical depth and/or physical conditions of the emitting gas in g0.11@xmath30.11 .",
    "first , we estimate an intensity ratio of two sio lines , @xmath47 . to calculate an average value , we use an intensity correlation for all the observed points in a box assigned in @xmath46 space for each feature . to remove the difference in resolution due to different beam size at the three lines",
    ", we reduce the resolution to be 45   by appropriate gaussian convolution .",
    "we found the ratios of the sio @xmath32 line to the sio @xmath2 line to be 0.91.0 for the e ridge and the three peaks and also found no significant difference in the ratios among the regions in the cloud .",
    "we also estimated the line intensity ratios of h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 to sio @xmath2 and found them to be uniform in each feature , although they differ significantly between the northern and southern parts of g0.11@xmath30.11 .",
    "for the e ridge and peak c , they are 0.5 . for peaks",
    "a and b , they are about 0.2 or smaller , although the signal - to - noise ratio is poor .",
    "the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 line is expected to be optically thin , because of its small abundance . we can check it by comparing the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 intensity with the cs @xmath32 intensity .",
    "we should note that since the excitation parameters of both the lines are similar , their intensity ratio ought not to be a strong function of the physical conditions of the gas ; accordingly , the only causes of variation in this ratio must be variations either in the relative abundances of the species or in their relative optical depth . using an h@xmath0co@xmath1 abundance of @xmath48 and a cs abundance of @xmath49 @xcite together with excitation parameters of the lines , the expected intensity ratio of h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 to cs @xmath32 is about @xmath50 , if both lines are optically thin . using cs observations by @xcite , the line intensity ratio of h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 to cs @xmath32",
    "is calculated to be 0.120.14 in the southern part of g0.11@xmath30.11 .",
    "it follows that the cs line in this locality must be optically thick , whereas the optical depth of h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 is about 0.1 . in the northern part of the cloud ,",
    "the ratio is about 0.05 or smaller and the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 line is therefore optically thin .",
    "then we estimate the column density of the southern part of g0.11@xmath30.11 and the molecular mass of the whole cloud from h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 intensity under the condition of local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) . in this case , we need to know the kinetic temperature ( @xmath51 ) of the emitting gas .",
    "the kinetic temperature of molecular gas in the galactic center region is controversial . in the galactic center region , @xmath51 of dense molecular clouds",
    "is estimated to be 6080 k or hotter @xcite . here",
    "we assume @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the column density of molecular hydrogen at the e ridge is derived to be @xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to about 640740 mag in @xmath5 ( visual extinction ) at the typical gas - to - dust ratio expected for dense clouds , and about 8090 mag and 1012 mag in @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( extinction at @xmath55 ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "similar values are obtained for peak c. this large @xmath54 is consistent with the fact that g0.11@xmath30.11 is observed as a shadow in an infrared map with the _ midcourse space experiment _",
    "( _ msx _ ; egan et al .",
    "the shadow has a spatial extension on the sky similar to that in @xmath56 .    in submillimeter continuum map",
    "we can find the counterpart of g0.11@xmath30.11 , although it is less prominent than major submillimeter features @xcite . using the same conversion from gas column density to submillimeter brightness as @xcite",
    ", @xmath57 corresponds to 20 jy beam@xmath58 at 450 @xmath59 m with 8   beam and 8 jy beam@xmath58 at 850 @xmath59 m with 15   beam .",
    "the maps with scuba ( submillimeter common - user bolometric array ; pierce - price et al .",
    "2000 ) show about 1520 jy beam@xmath58 at 450 @xmath59 m and 34 jy beam@xmath58 at 850 @xmath59 m .",
    "the estimated values are consistent because both estimations are based on assumptions with some uncertainty .",
    "the gas - to - dust mass ratio may be reduced in the cloud because strong thermal sio line of the cloud suggests dust evaporation .",
    "the molecular abundance of h@xmath0co@xmath1 may be smaller than the value we assumed .",
    "moreover , inhomogeneity in the cloud may affect the conversion factors from the observable values to the true mass of the cloud .",
    "the estimated column density of g0.11@xmath30.11 is one of the largest ever observed even in the galactic center region . for several x - ray sources in the galactic center region ,",
    "total hydrogen column densities were estimated to be @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the cloud g0.11@xmath30.11 shows a column density larger by at least factor of 5 than the ordinary environments in the galactic center region .",
    "it is extraordinarily large , being comparable only to sgr  b2 , which is the most massive cloud in the galaxy .",
    "other than g0.11@xmath30.11 , many dark features in the _ msx _ map are found in the galactic center region .",
    "they are called the _ msx _ dark clouds @xcite .",
    "some of them have also been observed in the @xmath61 line @xcite .",
    "typical column densities for _ msx _ dark clouds are estimated to be @xmath62 .",
    "our estimated column density of g0.11@xmath30.11 is as large as the typical _ msx _ dark clouds ; n.b .",
    ", @xcite did not observe g0.11@xmath30.11 .",
    "finally we estimated the molecular mass of g0.11@xmath30.11 to be @xmath63 from the integrated intensity in the h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 line for @xmath64 .",
    "this is consistent with the previous estimate , based on the cs @xmath2 line ( @xmath65 , tsuboi et al .",
    "we should note that the previous estimate was made on the assumption that the cs @xmath2 line is moderately opaque ( @xmath66 ) and should therefore have a large uncertainty .",
    "the intensity ratio of the two sio lines , @xmath47 is about 0.91.0 for all the features in g0.11@xmath30.11 (   [ sec : ratio ] ) .",
    "this value implies two possibilities ; one is that the both sio lines are optically thick , and the other is that both lines are optically thin and the density of molecular hydrogen in the sio - emitting gas is @xmath67 .",
    "however , the latter case is unlikely for the following two reasons . if the hydrogen density were @xmath67 , the cs lines would be optically thin .",
    "but our estimation (   [ sec : nh ] ) , as well as the previous estimate @xcite , shows that the cs line is ( at least moderately ) optically thick .",
    "moreover , uniformity of the sio line intensity ratio over g0.11@xmath30.11 under the optically thin case requires uniformity of the gas density over a scale of several parsecs in a cloud that , on the contrary , is known to have a complicated morphology .",
    "therefore , we conclude the former case to be likely : both sio lines are optically thick in g0.11@xmath30.11 .",
    "because the observed antenna temperature at the sio line is much lower than the expected gas kinetic temperature , the beam filling factor must be smaller than unity ; i.e. the telescope beam is not filled by the emitting surface .",
    "hence , we should employ a `` clumpy model '' @xcite to consider the physical state of g0.11@xmath30.11 . using the clumpy model ,",
    "the observed line intensity ratio depends on the opacity of the emitting clumps , and the observed antenna temperature is reduced by the beam filling factor .    using the clumpy model and an optically thick line",
    ", we can roughly estimate some clump parameters . in figure",
    "[ figsiochannelmap ] , we find that the main - beam brightness temperatures of most features in g0.11@xmath30.11 are @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath69 , the typical beam filling factor is 0.02 . because g0.11@xmath30.11 does not show a discrete clump with 35   beam , there must be 10 or more clumps in a beam .",
    "thus , the clump diameter is smaller than 1.5 , or 0.06 pc .",
    "the averaged gas density in a clump is then estimated to be higher than @xmath70 .    in this case , a clump may be unstable because the free - fall time of the clump is much shorter than the sound crossing time .",
    "howerver , it can be stable when the size of the clump is much smaller . given a beam averaged column density and beam filling factor , the free - fall time is propotional to square root of the clump size .",
    "on the other hand , given a gas temperature , the sound crossing time is propotional to the size .",
    "therefore , the clump can be stable when the size is smaller than @xmath71 pc for our estimated values .",
    "note that the critical size may be much larger if the clump is supported by magnetic field .",
    "the clumpy model can also explain why the intensity ratios of the optically thin ( h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath2 ) to thick ( the cs and sio ) lines are not significantly different in the southern half of the cloud . in the clumpy model , the shape of a line profile observed with a finite beam size is given only by the distribution of the emitting clumps in velocity space .",
    "in the case of a small beam filling factor , each emitting clump does not screen other clumps even if the line is optically thick . therefore , optically thick lines show almost the same profile shape as optically thin lines .",
    "the cs line intensity observed by @xcite shows that the main - beam brightness temperature in the cs @xmath2 line is brighter than that in the sio lines by a factor of 3 , although both the lines are optically thick in g0.11@xmath30.11 .",
    "this means that the beam filling factor at the sio line must be smaller than that at the cs line .",
    "however , in the case of the simplest clumpy model , in which every emitting clump is assumed to be isothermal and uniform in density , the line intensity ratio of sio to cs is expected to be unity because the excitation parameters of sio and cs are very close . to resolve this discrepancy",
    ", we deduce that the emitting gas clump has a steep abundance gradient in sio and that the typical size of an optical thick surface ( or beam filling factor ) that emits the sio line is much smaller than the corresponding emission surface of the cs line . with the same clump temperature and density , the optical depth in the sio lines can vary , depending on the sio abundance . in fact ,",
    "the observed sio abundance , @xmath72 , differs by several orders of magnitude for molecular gas in the galactic disk region : e.g. , @xmath73 for quiescent dark clouds @xcite and @xmath74 in bipolar outflows of star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the projected area of the sio - emitting part to that of the cs - emitting part is the same as the value of the intensity ratio of these lines because both lines are optically thick .",
    "we find that the intensity ratio of sio @xmath2 to cs @xmath2 is uniform over the cloud .",
    "this uniformity implies that the ratio of the projected areas in a clump is uniform over the cloud .",
    "thus , the abundance gradient of sio in the emitting clump is presumably due to a mechanism on a scale much larger than the whole cloud .",
    "consequently , clump internal structure should be the same over the whole cloud . in this case",
    ", it is a reasonable assumption that the emitting clump is spherically symmetric .    in the case of a spherically symmetric clump ,",
    "the sio - emitting part should be at smaller radius than the cs - emitting part .",
    "it follows that the emitting clump is hotter in the innermost part because the sio abundance is believed to increase in hot ( e.g. shock heated ) gas . even in this case ,",
    "our discussion is valid , although our model is inconsistent to the simplest clumpy model ; the main - beam brightness temperature of an optically thick clump is the same when the product of the surface area and the actual brightness temperature is the same .    the large opacity even in dense gas tracers and large extinction even in mid - infrared suggest that the cooling time may be longer than in cores in star - forming regions in the galactic disk region .",
    "using virial mass analysis , @xcite show that molecular clouds in the galactic center region are under a high pressure of @xmath75 .",
    "emitting clumps in g0.11@xmath30.11 may be compressed by this external pressure .    from our observations",
    ", g0.11@xmath30.11 is found to be likely composed of many hot and dense clumps , which can hardly be cooled down because of large extinction even in infrared .",
    "this condition is greatly different from that of star - forming clouds in the galactic disk region . under such condition",
    ", star formation should be very different .",
    "this may be a reason why a dense cluster of massive stars is seen only in the galactic center region . although g0.11@xmath30.11 is a good site for investigating this speculation , high - resolution observations in rarer molecules such as cs isotopes are required to unveil optically thick clumps .",
