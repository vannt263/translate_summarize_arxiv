    "prior to anderson s work , graham and witten extended the renormalized volume program to include analogous problems for the divergent `` area '' of minimal submanifolds that are embedded in conformally compact geometries and have boundary at a conformal infinity @xcite ; in the case of minimal 3-manifolds they showed that the anomaly term gives the willmore energy functional .",
    "a detailed study of the case of minimal surfaces in poincar",
    " einstein 3-manifolds by alexakis and mazzeo showed how the renormalized area is related to the willmore functional ( now computed for an embedded minimal surface ) .",

    "@xcite such terms are in turn linked the so - called @xmath1-curvature discovered in @xcite .",
    "more recently it was realized that working with general conformally compact manifolds leads naturally to an extension to higher dimensional analogs of the willmore equation  @xcite , and via volume expansions , energy functionals for these  @xcite ( see also @xcite for an alternative approach ) .",
    "here we show that there is tremendous gain in treating a new but related problem , namely solid infinite volume regions embedded in manifolds of the same dimension",
    ". asides from allowing the study of renormalized volumes for general regions , in particular this provides a direct and efficient route to the inclusion of boundary / transgression type terms and the generation of higher willmore energy functionals with boundary .",
    "our ultimate focus is on structures linked to conformal geometry .",
    "however many aspects of volume renormalization rely on far less structure and so apply to many other settings and geometries ( _ cf . e.g. _ , @xcite ) . with this in mind",
    "we consider initially the simple setting of a connected @xmath2-manifold @xmath3 with boundary @xmath4 ( and interior @xmath5 ) equipped with a singular volume measure @xmath6 where @xmath7 is any volume measure on @xmath3 , @xmath8 is a non - negative defining function for @xmath4 and @xmath9 is a suitable real number .",
    "note that @xmath10 is unchanged if we replace the pair @xmath11 with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is any positive function .",
    "thus the data @xmath10 is equivalent to a density @xmath14 $ ] which is a section of the positive @xmath15 root of the bundle of volume densities .",
    "the manifold @xmath16 has infinite volume but via regularization one may consider the existence of some renormalized volume .",
    "in fact we wish to treat the more general question of the volume of a connected , dimension @xmath2 , closed submanifold @xmath17 ( with interior  @xmath18 ) of  @xmath3 that intersects  @xmath4 along a connected hypersurface @xmath19 that forms a closed smoothly bounded submanifold of @xmath4 .",
    "we assume @xmath20 is a smooth properly embedded submanifold of @xmath5 .",
    "we depict this in the first picture below : @xmath21{rod_right.pdf }   \\includegraphics[scale=.4]{rod_left.pdf}\\ ] ] with the restriction of @xmath10 to @xmath22 , the structure @xmath23 has infinite volume .",
    "we treat the asymptotics of the regulated volume of @xmath24 in theorem [ expansion ] below , and show that if @xmath25 then , as coefficient of @xmath26 , there is an _ anomaly _",
    "term @xmath27 , namely a term that is independent of the choice of @xmath8 representing @xmath28 .",
    "thus @xmath27 is a property of  @xmath29 and , in particular , is independent of how the volume computation was regulated . via distributions that will be explained below",
    ", the theorem also gives formulae for the other divergent terms in the expansion .",
    "the leading term takes the form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 measures the volume of @xmath32 according to the measure determined by @xmath10 and the choice of @xmath33 .",
    "the renormalized volume is the term in the expansion independent of @xmath34 .",
    "theorem  [ transform ] shows how this depends on the choice of regulator and also that the latter is a conformal primitive for an integral anomaly operator , which returns the anomaly when acting on the constant function  @xmath35 .",
    "we next specialize to the conformal setting and this enables a finer analysis of the structures mentioned .",
    "for example we are easily able to provide an explicit general formula for the two leading divergent terms in the volume asymototics , see theorem [ divergences ] . by _ conformal setting _ we mean that we assume that @xmath36 and  @xmath3 is equipped with an equivalence class @xmath37 of conformally related riemannian metrics .",
    "so for @xmath38 we have that @xmath39 for some smooth function @xmath40 .",
    "the replacement of @xmath41 with  @xmath42 determines the replacement of @xmath43 with  @xmath44 , equivalently @xmath8 with  @xmath45 ( representing  @xmath28 ) .",
    "each choice of metric @xmath46 induces a metric @xmath47 on @xmath32 , and we show that there is a corresponding pair of functions @xmath48 , each determined locally by the data of @xmath49 and @xmath41 , so that @xmath50\\ , , \\]]see theorem [ q+t ] .",
    "the quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 arise from a fixed algorithm used to prove this theorem , which also gives a formula for @xmath51 .",
    "since the anomaly is determined by  @xmath49 , the right - hand - side is conformally invariant ; the same answer @xmath27 is obtained if we compute with @xmath53 and thus @xmath54 .",
    "so the @xmath52 may be thought of as a natural _ transgression _ for the quantity  @xmath51 ( neither of which is separately conformally invariant ) .    with a suitable restriction ensuring the construction leading to  ( [ qt ] ) depends only on data intrinsic to @xmath55 , we obtain that @xmath51 is the usual branson @xmath0-curvature of @xmath56 , and the corresponding transgression @xmath52 is also determined by this data . in addition corollary",
    "[ min ] , which treats this , shows that for a second canonical restriction sensitive also to the conformal embedding @xmath57 , the quantity @xmath52 provides a transgression for the extrinsically coupled @xmath0-curvature ; the latter generalizes the @xmath0-curvature to a curvature for embedded hypersurfaces @xcite . in view of these cases we shall refer to any @xmath48 as a @xmath58-curvature pair . for closed hypersurfaces",
    "this extrinsically coupled @xmath0-curvature provides a lagrangian density for higher order willmore type energies @xcite .",
    "thus via @xmath48 pairs , where @xmath51 is the extrinsically coupled @xmath0-curvature , the right - hand - side of ( [ qt ] ) yields a conformally invariant higher willmore energy functional for hypersurfaces with boundary .",
    "there is also a nice interpretation of the anomaly associated with these @xmath0-curvature results : it is the anomaly for the volume expansion of the region enclosed by @xmath32 and a minimal hypersurface in @xmath59 spanning @xmath60 .",
    "indeed it is this setup that we use to obtain the results just mentioned .",
    "we are informed that such geometries have played a role in recent holographic studies of quantum complexity  @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that , at least for the case of branson @xmath0-curvature , the transgression curvature @xmath52 is closely related to the @xmath1-curvature for dimension 3 hypersurfaces found by chang - qing  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite where this was applied for problems with @xmath0-curvature prescribed on four - manifolds with boundary , and  @xcite for @xmath1-like curvatures in other dimensions and orders .    the general theory is illustrated and examined in detail for the case of surfaces in sections  [ anomaly ] and  [ yamabe ] ; meaning that we there treat @xmath61 of dimension 2 . in particular theorem  [ anomaly ] provides , in this case , general formul  for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , while theorem  [ singanomaly ] specializes this general result to the case depending on embedding @xmath62 .",
    "this gives a willmore energy expressed in terms of the euler characteristic @xmath63 and explicit boundary terms generated by an extrinsic @xmath0-curvature / transgression pair .",
