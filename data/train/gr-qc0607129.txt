    "the bianchi cosmologies play an important role in theoretical cosmology and have been much studied since the 1960s .",
    "a bianchi cosmology represents a spatially homogeneous universe , since by definition the spacetime admits a three - parameter group of isometries whose orbits are spacelike hyper - surfaces .",
    "these models can be used to analyze aspects of the physical universe which pertain to or which may be affected by anisotropy in the rate of expansion , for example , the cosmic microwave background radiation , nucleosynthesis in the early universe , and the question of the isotropization of the universe itself @xcite . for simplification and description of the large scale behaviour of the actual universe ,",
    "locally rotationally symmetric [ henceforth referred as lrs ] bianchi i spacetime have widely studied @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "when the bianchi i spacetime expands equally in two spatial directions it is called locally rotationally symmetric .",
    "these kinds of models are interesting because lidsey @xcite showed that they are equivalent to a flat ( frw ) universe with a self - interesting scalar field and a free massless scalar field , but produced no explicit example .",
    "some explicit solutions were pointed out in references @xcite .",
    "the einstein s field equations are coupled system of high non - linear differential equations and we seek physical solutions to the field equations for their applications in cosmology and astrophysics . in order to solve the field equations we normally assume a form for the matter content or that spacetime admits killing vector symmetries @xcite .",
    "solutions to the field equations may also be generated by applying a law of variation for hubble s parameter which was proposed by berman @xcite . in simple cases",
    "the hubble law yields a constant value of deceleration parameter .",
    "it is worth observing that most of the well - known models of einstein s theory and brans - deke theory with curvature parameter @xmath1 , including inflationary models , are models with constant deceleration parameter . in earlier literature",
    "cosmological models with a constant deceleration parameter have been studied by berman @xcite , berman and gomide @xcite , johri and desikan @xcite , singh and desikan @xcite , maharaj and naidoo @xcite , pradhan and _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and others .",
    "but redshift magnitude test has had a chequered history . during the 1960s and the 1970s ,",
    "it was used to draw very categorical conclusions .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath2 was then claimed to lie between @xmath3 and @xmath4 and thus it was claimed that the universe is decelerating . today",
    "s situation , we feel , is hardly different .",
    "observations @xcite of type ia supernovae ( sne ) allow to probe the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the main conclusion of these observations is that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "so we can consider the cosmological models with variable deceleration parameter .",
    "the readers are advised to see the papers by vishwakarma and narlikar @xcite and virey _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and references therein for a review on the determination of the deceleration parameter from supernovae data .    motivated with the situation discussed above , in this paper we can focus upon the problem of establishing a formalism for studying the relativistic evolution for a time dependent deceleration parameter in an expanding universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the metric and the field equations are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we deal with a general solution .",
    "the sections 4 , 5 , and 6 contain the three different cases for the solutions in exponential , polynomial and sinusoidal forms respectively . finally in section 7 concluding remarks will be given .",
    "we consider the lrs bianchi type - i metric in the form @xcite @xmath5 where a and b are functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the energy momentum - tensor in the presence of perfect fluid has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the energy density , thermodynamical pressure respectively and @xmath11 is the four velocity vector satisfying the relations @xmath12 the einstein s field equations ( in gravitational units @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) read as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ricci tensor ; @xmath17 = @xmath18 is the ricci scalar . the einstein s field equations ( [ eq4 ] ) for the line element ( [ eq1 ] ) has been set up as @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 the energy conservation equation yields @xmath23 where dots and primes indicate partial differentiation with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath6 respectively .",

    "equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , after integration , yields @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an arbitrary function of @xmath6 .",

    "a negative cosmological term adds to the attractive gravity of matter ; therefore , universe with a negative cosmological term is invariably doomed to recollapse .",
    "the cosmological term in section 6 also decreases while time increases to a specific instant . during this period",
    "as we can understand from figure [ fig : sinlmd ] , we will have enough matter creation to force the universe to oscillate for ever due to sinusoidal property of @xmath66 .",
    "this means we always have annihilation and creation of matter permanently . at this point",
    "one more sentence may be added to our discussion and i.e. as the graphs for @xmath66 and @xmath9 in this case the explosion of the universe at the early stages of its creation has been only a consequence of matter creation .",
