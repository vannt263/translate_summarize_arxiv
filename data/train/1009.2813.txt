    "the @xmath5 collaboration has reported a @xmath2 deviation from the standard model ( sm ) prediction of the like sign dimuon asymmetry in semileptonic @xmath1 decay @xcite .",
    "this observation joins past anomalous measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays that can be interpreted as a pattern of deviations consistent with new physics contributing a new phase in @xmath8 mixing ( for a recent global fit and discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "deviation from the standard model ( sm ) expectation @xcite in the averaged measurements of @xmath7 performed at belle and babar @xcite correlates correctly with a new physics ( np ) contribution of a phase to @xmath9 with a sign consistent with the np phase implied by the @xmath0 dimuon measurement .",
    "such a np phase also correlates with the expectation of a shift in @xmath10 extracted from @xmath6 compared to the sm expectation @xcite and extractions from measurements in @xmath11 .",
    "such a consistent deviation is also observed , its statistical significance is @xmath12 .",
    "also see @xcite for a discussion on the evidence for a np phase in @xmath9 and @xmath13 meson mixing . ]    if the explanation of the like sign dimuon asymmetry measurement and these correlated deviations are not statistical fluctuations , then new physics interpretations of this pattern are of interest .",
    "general operator analyses have been carried out @xcite and indicate that operators induced by scalar exchange with unenhanced yukawa couplings and order one parameters in the potential ( i.e. order one wilson coefficients ) the mass scale suppressing the operators of interest is a few hundred @xmath14 .",
    "such a low mass scale is challenging to reconcile with known constraints from flavour physics unless minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xcite is imposed .",
    "new physics ( np ) models with mfv have the quark flavor group @xmath15 only broken by the yukawa couplings .",
    "however this scenario does allow new phases and so provides a framework for explaining the anomalies mentioned above without giving rise to flavor changing neutral current effects that are in conflict with experiment .",
    "in this paper we discuss scalar models with mfv that can explain these anomalies .",
    "we first review how tree level exchanges of a neutral complex scalar in a simple two scalar doublet model can lead to enhanced cp violation in the @xmath16 meson system and discuss the phenomenology of this model .",
    "we then show that limits on electric dipole moments suggest that the coupling of the charged scalar to the right handed @xmath3-type quarks is suppressed while its coupling to the @xmath4-type right handed quarks must be enhanced to be consistent with the data .",
    "we construct an extension of the mfv two scalar doublet model where this occurs naturally .",
