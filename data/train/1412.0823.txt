    "the advancing interference management techniques have sharpened our understanding in the fundamental limits ( e.g. , channel capacity ) of wireless networks with interference .",
    "the degrees of freedom ( dof ) characterization serves as the first - order capacity approximation for wireless networks , by which the obtained insights can be transferred to practical scenarios .",
    "the dof indicates the system throughput scaling with the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the high snr regime .",
    "although the dof as a figure of merit has limitations @xcite , it has proved useful in understanding the fundamental limits of several cooperative communication protocols , such as interference alignment ( ia ) @xcite and network mimo @xcite among many others . a common feature behind much of the analysis of cooperation benefits in either interference channels ( ic ) or broadcast channels ( bc ) has been the availability of instantaneous channel state information at the transmitters ( csit ) , with exceptions dealing with so - called limited feedback schemes . nevertheless , most efforts on limited @xcite , imperfect @xcite , or delayed feedback settings @xcite , among others @xcite , rely on the assumption that the transmitters are endowed with an instantaneous form of channel information whose coherence time is similar to that of the actual fading channels , so that a good fraction or the totality of the dof achieved with perfect csit can be obtained .",
    "such an assumption is hard to realize in many practical scenarios , such as cellular networks @xcite .",
    "conversely , it has been reported in @xcite that a substantial dof gain can not be realized in ic or bc scenario without csit",
    ". a closer examination of these pessimistic results however reveals that many of the considered networks are fully connected , in that any transmitter interferes with any non - intended receiver in the network .",
    "owing to the nodes random placement , the fact that power decays fast with distance , the existence of obstacles , and local shadowing effects , we may argue that certain interference links are unavoidably much weaker than others , suggesting the use of a partially - connected graph to model , at least approximately , the network topology .",
    "an interesting question then arises as to whether the partial connectivity could be leveraged to allow the use of some relaxed form of csit while still achieving a substantial dof performance .",
    "in particular the exploitation of topological information , simply indicating which of the interfering links are weak enough to be approximated by zero interference and which links are too strong to do so , is of great practical interest . the evidence that the topological information is beneficial can be traced back to @xcite , where some local topological information was exploited to improve network performance by some coloring schemes such as `` coded set scheduling '' .",
    "most recently , this question was intensively addressed in @xcite , in the context of the interference channel and x channel with topology information , and focusing on the symmetric dof . these different topological interference management ( tim )",
    "approaches arrive at a common conclusion that the symmetric dof can be significantly improved with the sole topology information , _ provided that the network is partially connected_. in @xcite , the tim problem is bridged with the index coding problem @xcite , stating that the optimal solution to the latter is the outer bound of the former , and the linear solution to the former is automatically transferrable to the latter .",
    "the ensuing extension in @xcite that attacks the tim problem from an index coding perspective , covers a wider class of network topologies , partly settling the problem for the sparse networks with each receiver interfered by at most two interfering links .",
    "given such promising results , a logical question is whether the tim framework can somehow be exploited in the context of an interference network where a message exchange mechanism between transmitters pre - exists .",
    "for instance , in future lte - a cellular networks , a backhaul routing mechanism ensures that base stations selected to cooperate under the coordinated multi - point ( comp ) framework receive a copy of the messages to be transmitted . with perfect instantaneous csit",
    ", the benefit of transmitter cooperation was investigated in fully connected ic @xcite and partially connected ic @xcite .",
    "still , the exchange of timely csi is challenging due to the rapid obsolescence of instantaneous csi and the latency of backhaul signaling links . in this case , a broadcast channel over distributed transmitters ( a.k.a .",
    "network mimo ) ensues , with a lack of instantaneous csit .",
    "the problem raised by this paper concerns the use of topology information in this setting .",
    "we follow the same strategy as @xcite in targeting the symmetric dof as a simple figure of merit . by resorting to interference avoidance and alignment techniques",
    ", we characterize the achievable and/or optimal symmetric dof of the distributed bc with topology information in several scenarios of interest .",
    "more specifically , our contributions are organized as follows :    * a graph theoretic perspective will be provided in section iii , in which we propose an interference avoidance approach built upon fractional selective graph coloring over the square of line graph of the original network topology . in doing so , the optimal symmetric dof of three - cell networks with all possible topologies is determined , by a new outer bound on the basis of the concept of generator sequence . *",
    "an interference alignment perspective will be also offered in section iv by introducing an alignment - feasible graph to show the feasibility of interference alignment between any two messages .",
    "the sufficient conditions for arbitrary network topologies to achieve a certain amount of symmetric dof are identified with this graph , by which we also identify the achievable symmetric dof of so - called _ regular _ networks ( i.e. , network topologies with same number of interfering links at all transmitters / receivers ) .",
    "further , the optimality for the wyner - type regular networks ( i.e. , with only one interfering link ) is characterized with the aid of an outer bound based on an application of compound settings .",
    "lastly , the above alignment feasibility condition is generalized to arbitrary number of messages , leading us to a construction of a hypergraph , by which achievable symmetric dof of arbitrary network topologies are consequently established via hypergraph covering . * in section iv , we also bridge our problem to index coding problems , letting the outer bounds of the latter serve our problem as well , by which we identify the sufficient and necessary condition when time division is symmetric dof optimal .    : throughout this paper , we define @xmath0 , and @xmath1 { \\triangleq}\\{1,2,\\dots , n\\}$ ] for any integer @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 represent a variable , a set , and a matrix / vector , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 is the complementary set of @xmath4 , and @xmath7 is the cardinality of the set @xmath4 .",

    "@xmath21 is the indicator function with values 1 when the parameter is true and 0 otherwise .",
    "@xmath22 follows the standard landau notation .",
    "logarithms are in base 2 .",
    "we consider a @xmath23-cell partially connected cellular network , in which each transmitter ( e.g. base station ) is equipped with one antenna and serves one single - antenna receiver ( e.g. , user ) .",
    "this cellular network can be modeled by a partially connected interference channel .",
    "the received signal for receiver @xmath24 at time instant @xmath25 can be modeled by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the channel coefficient between transmitter @xmath12 and receiver @xmath24 at time instant @xmath25 and the nonzero channel coefficients drawn from a continuous distribution are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) , the transmitted signal @xmath28 is subject to the average power constraint , i.e. , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the average transmit power , and @xmath31 is the additive white gaussian noise with zero - mean and unit - variance and is independent of transmitted signals and channel coefficients .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the transmit set containing the indices of transmitters that are _ connected _ to receiver @xmath33 , and by @xmath34 the receive set consisting of the indices of receivers that are _ connected _ to transmitter @xmath33 , for @xmath35 . in practice",
    ", the partial connectivity may be modeled by taking those interference links that are  weak enough \" ( due to distance and/or shadowing ) to zero .",
    "for instance in @xcite , a reasonable model is suggested whereby a link is disconnected if the received signal power falls below the effective noise floor .",
    "however , other models maybe envisioned and the study of how robust the derived schemes are with respect to modeling errors is an open problem beyond the scope of this paper .    conforming with tim framework ,",
    "the actual channel realizations are not available at the transmitters , yet the network topology ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) is known by all transmitters and receivers .",
    "a typical transmitter cooperation is enabled in the form of message sharing , where every transmitter is endowed the messages desired by its connected receivers , i.e. , transmitter @xmath33 has access to a subset of messages @xmath37 , where @xmath38 @xmath39 denotes the message desired by receiver @xmath24 .",
    "we refer hereafter to tim problem with transmitter cooperation as `` tim - comp '' problem .",
    "each message may originate from multiple transmitters but is intended for one unique receiver . as such , the so - called direct links in tim settings are not required to be present here .",
    "we consider a block fading channel , where the channel coefficients stay constant during a coherence time @xmath40 but vary to independent realizations in the next coherence time .",
    "the coherence time is @xmath41 by default unless otherwise specified . for channel coefficients and transmitted signals , the time index @xmath25 is omitted during the coherence time for the sake of brevity .",
    "the network topology is fixed throughout the communication .",
    "while message sharing creates the opportunity of transmitter cooperation , it also imposes some challenges .",
    "for the multiple - unicast tim problem in partially connected ic or x networks @xcite , each message has a unique source and a unique destination that are determined _ a priori _ such that the desired and interfering links are known . by contrast , with transmitter cooperation , the message can be sent from _ any _ source that has access to this message .",
    "consequently , the approaches developed for ic and x networks can not be directly applied here , as the desired and interference links are not able to be predetermined .    for notational convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath42 as the ensemble of channel coefficients , and denote by @xmath43 the network topology known by all transmitters and receivers .",

    "in contrast , with message sharing , the desired message @xmath93 can be sent either from transmitter 1 or 4 .",
    "hence , scheduling can be done across links rather than across transmitters .",
    "for instance , if the link transmitter 4 @xmath96 receiver 1 ( denoted by @xmath97 ) is scheduled , the links adjacent to @xmath97 ( i.e. , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 ) as well as the links adjacent to @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( i.e. , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) should not be scheduled , because activating transmitter 1 will interfere receiver 1 , and receivers 2 and 4 will overhear interferences from transmitter 4 such that any delivery from transmitter 1 or to receivers 2 and 4 causes mutual interference .",
    "a possible link scheduling is shown in table  [ tab : link - sch ] .",

    "any two @xmath318-regular networks are similar , because they are in fact the same cycle with rearranged vertices .",
    "hence , it suffices to consider one typical topology of the @xmath318-regular networks , e.g. , a @xmath23-cell cyclic wyner network , for the convenience of presentation .",

    "we consider two cases when @xmath23 is even or odd .",
    "* @xmath23 is even : let @xmath661 and @xmath662 . consider the received signals @xmath469 and the signals of their respective compound receivers @xmath663 .",
    "following the proof of the general case , we have @xmath664 where the noisy version @xmath665 can be recovered from @xmath23 linearly independent equations .",

    "thus , with @xmath676 and @xmath677 , it follows that @xmath678    to sum up , we have @xmath679 whenever @xmath23 is even or odd .",

    "two messages are delivered during three time slots , yielding @xmath503 dof per user , which coincides with the outer bound .",
    "this completes the proof of optimality .        according to the definition of proper partition , for a portion @xmath689",

    "thus , symmetric dof of @xmath721 are achievable , almost surely .      in this theorem",
    ", we represent the achievable symmetric dof of the tim - comp problem by a graph - theoretic parameter , i.e. , fractional covering number . to this end , we will bridge our problem to the hypergraph fractional covering problem , which is in general a set covering problem .",
    "first of all , we construct such a hypergraph @xmath445 according to the network topology . from the definition of proper partition",
    ", it follows that if a set @xmath366 satisfies @xmath723 then any two messages in @xmath724 are mutually alignment - feasible .",
    "the messages @xmath725 can be sent from the transmitters @xmath726 , respectively , in the form of @xmath727 with the same precoding vector @xmath728 ( alternatively , the links from transmitter @xmath695 to receiver @xmath729 @xmath730 can be scheduled at the same time slot ) , where @xmath731 as such , only one transmitted signal @xmath727 is active in subspace spanned by @xmath244 at receiver @xmath732 , and hence @xmath733 is recoverable from this subspace .",
    "the presence of the subspace spanned by @xmath728 carrying on messages with indices in @xmath371 guarantees the successful delivery of the messages in @xmath724 .",
    "thus , the set @xmath371 can serve as a hyperedge of @xmath445 .",
    "any set of elements in @xmath364 that satisfies the condition serves as a hyperedge . as a result ,",
    "the hypergraph @xmath445 is constructed with vertex set @xmath364 and hyperedge set being enumeration of all possible sets of elements that satisfy condition .    our problem to find the symmetric dof is equivalent to the covering problem of this hypergraph to find the minimum number of hyperedges @xmath734 such that each @xmath526 appears at least @xmath25 of the @xmath371 s .",
    "according to the definition of hypergraph covering in appendix a , the minimum number of hyperedges that meets the covering problem can be represented by the @xmath25-fold covering number . with hyperedge cover of @xmath452 times , each vertex in @xmath364",
    "is covered at least @xmath25 times , meaning that within a @xmath452 dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath735 , each @xmath736 can be delivered @xmath25 times free of interference . as a consequence",
    ", the achievable symmetric dof can be represented by @xmath737 where @xmath362 is the hypergraph fractional covering number as defined in appendix a.      the proof follows the channel enhancement approach in @xcite with slight modification by taking transmitter cooperation ( i.e. , message sharing ) into account .",
    "we brief the steps of the channel enhancement as follows .    *",
    "denote by @xmath738 the capacity region of the tim - comp problem , where transmitter @xmath12 is endowed with the messages desired by its connected receivers , i.e. , @xmath64 , for all @xmath338 .",
    "* @xmath739 , if @xmath740 , we specify @xmath741 which will not impact on the reliability of the capacity - achieving coding scheme .",
    "* @xmath739 , if @xmath742 , we provide @xmath743 to receiver @xmath33 as side information , and connect the missing link by setting the channel coefficient as a non - zero value @xmath744 where the newly enabled interferences from transmitter @xmath24 can be eliminated given the side information @xmath743 .",
    "* allowing full transmitter cooperation and full csit , the channel turns out an miso channel to each receiver , where all received signals are statistically equivalent .",
    "denote by @xmath745 the capacity region of current channel .",
    "the capacity region is not diminished , i.e. , @xmath746 . * with the network equivalence theorem @xcite , the miso channel can be replaced by a noise - free link with finite capacity , as the bottleneck link of index coding problem with capacity region @xmath747 .",
    "it is noticed that all the above steps do not reduce the capacity region , i.e. , @xmath748 , such that the capacity region of the index coding problem with side information @xmath749 can serve as an outer bound of our problem .",
    "first , we prove the sufficient condition that , if the demand graph of index coding problem @xmath384 with @xmath750 is acyclic or @xmath751 is an empty graph , then the optimal symmetric dof value is @xmath196 . to this end , we only need to prove the following chain : @xmath752    being aware of the fact that the symmetric dof @xmath196 can be trivially achieved by time division , we only have to prove @xmath196 is also an outer bound . from corollary 7 in @xcite , the necessary and sufficient condition to achieve symmetric capacity of @xmath196 per message is that the message demand graph is acyclic .",
    "thus , if the demand graph is acyclic , then the tim - comp problem is upper bounded by @xmath196 .",
    "that is , the second part of the chain is true . by this",
    ", the sufficiency can be proved if the first part of the chain is also true .",
    "we construct the proof of this statement by contraposition , i.e. , @xmath753    to prove this contraposition , we first consider there exists a cycle involving only two messages , e.g. , @xmath754 and @xmath755 , in the demand graph .",
    "thus , we have @xmath756 and @xmath757 , while @xmath758 and @xmath759 , such that there exist @xmath760 and @xmath761 where @xmath762 and @xmath763 whereas @xmath764 and @xmath765 .",
    "this leads to @xmath766 and @xmath767 .",
    "equivalently , there exist @xmath768 and @xmath769 , such that @xmath770 and @xmath771 , because both conditions imply the same alignment feasibility , where @xmath772 and @xmath773 can be aligned in the same subspace .",
    "consequently , two messages @xmath774 and @xmath775 are alignment - feasible , and therefore connected in @xmath197 .",
    "thus , @xmath776 is proven .",
    "furthermore , we consider the smallest cycle involving more than two messages , i.e. , @xmath777 with directed edge from message @xmath778 to receiver @xmath779 then via message @xmath780 to receiver @xmath780 and so on , for @xmath781 , with modulo applied to the indices . given the smallest cycle in the directed demand graph , we have @xmath782 from , it is readily verified that there must exist @xmath783 , such that @xmath784 . by set @xmath785 and @xmath786",
    "respectively in , we have @xmath787 it follows that @xmath788 and @xmath789 for all @xmath79 , and in turn @xmath790 otherwise , it results in contradictions with @xmath784 . recalling that @xmath777 forms a cycle ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath791 and @xmath792 for all @xmath793 , and therefore messages @xmath794 and @xmath795 are joint with an edge .",
    "thus , we conclude that , if there exist a cycle in demand graph , then @xmath776 .",
    "consequently , its contraposition is equivalently proven : if @xmath796 , then the corresponding demand graph is acyclic .",
    "thus , the first part of the chain is true , and in turn the necessity is proven .",
    "second , we prove the necessary condition that , if the optimal symmetric dof value is @xmath196 , then the demand graph is acyclic and @xmath197 is an empty graph .",
    "we achieve this goal by constructing a proof by contraposition , i.e. , if @xmath197 is not empty , or the demand graph of index coding problem @xmath384 is cyclic , then the symmetric dof value @xmath196 is sub - optimal . to this end , we only need to prove the following chain @xmath797 as proved above , if @xmath796 , then the demand graph of @xmath798 is acyclic . by contraposition , if the demand graph is cyclic , then @xmath776 .",
    "that is , the first part of the chain is true .",
    "let us focus on the second part of the chain .",
    "assume there exists an edge @xmath457 in @xmath197 , which implies that @xmath161 and @xmath38 are alignment feasible , i.e. , @xmath799 and @xmath799 .",
    "according to the definition of proper partition , we have a partition with size @xmath675 where @xmath161 and @xmath38 belong to one portion and the rest @xmath800 messages form @xmath800 portions , respectively , such that @xmath801 is achievable .",
    "thus , the statement of the second part of the chain is automatically implied .",
    "had proven the chain , the necessity is obtained .",
