    "planets are thought to predominantly form within 10  au of young low mass stars ( @xmath4 a few solar masses ) .",
    "concurrent with the process of planet formation , a rich carbon , nitrogen and oxygen chemistry evolves to eventually form the building blocks of the icy bodies within young planetary systems ; moons around giant planets , comets and kuiper belt objects .",
    "this chemistry will also seed the surfaces of rocky terrestrial planets with water and organics , probably either through impacts with comets or carried in hydrated refractory meteorites @xcite .",
    "this early , highly active and evolving stage takes place within the first few million years of a star s lifetime while the protoplanetary disk is still gas - rich .",
    "the planet forming region can therefore be traced by observations of warm ( 100 - 2000  k ) molecular gas , through a multitude of rotational and rovibrational transitions spanning the infrared wavelength range ( 2 - 200  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "one critical question is how the distribution of water occurred in the solar nebula and how the surface of the young earth was hydrated . @xcite and @xcite report detections of hundreds of water vapor lines in three protoplanetary disks observed with the _ spitzer _ space telescope infrared spectrometer ( irs ) between 10 and 36  @xmath1 m .",
    "these first , pioneering spectra were analyzed using simple ` slab models ' that assume level populations consistent with thermodynamic equilibrium and otherwise consisting only of a column density , a single excitation temperature and an emitting solid angle",
    ".    fits to data using such simple slab models result in column densities of @xmath5  @xmath6 , @xmath7  @xmath6 , and @xmath8  @xmath6 and an excitation temperature @xmath9  k for dr tau and as 205a , which is similar to the observations of aa tau by @xcite .",
    "the latter paper also reports the detection of co@xmath0 and that of the small organics c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn . given a slab model , the line emission is derived to be confined within radii ranging from 0.6 to 3.0  au .    recently , a number of theoretical models have appeared that focus on the gas - phase thermo - chemical modeling of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "these papers have different levels of complexity in their adopted physics ( e.g. , treatment of x - rays and/or fuv , the possibility of transport throughout the disk , time - dependent treatment of chemistry ) and deal with various chemical aspects ( e.g. , organic species , h@xmath0o , carbon fractionation ) .",
    "other theoretical models focus on the dynamical transport of individual species through the disk @xcite .",
    "a key question is therefore whether the large amounts of warm ( @xmath10  k ) water that have been observed can be explained by models with either _ in situ _ formation or _ dynamical transport _ from larger radii .    to date",
    ", neither the observational work nor the theoretical papers that consider the chemistry in the inner region of protoplanetary disks have shown how physical parameters  specifically the actual _ abundance structure _ of a given molecule  can be derived from line observations in a meaningful way . in this paper , we propose that , given the complexity of inner disk chemistry and volatile dynamics , progress can best be made by separating the chemical - dynamical model from the radiative transfer modeling of observations .",
    "this way , high quality observations , such as infrared imaging spectroscopy , can be used to _ derive _ an abundance structure of a given molecule by application of a radiative transfer code that performs : 1 ) a non - lte excitation calculation in a disk - geometry followed by , 2 ) raytracing that correctly samples the velocity field at small radii , and 3 ) a front end that simulates the action of the appropriate telescope / instrument .",
    "given a derived abundance structure , the interpretation step , using chemical - dynamical models , becomes much easier than the approach in which one begins with the chemical model .",
    "this paper describes step 1 ) .",
    "a companion paper describes steps 2 ) and 3 ) @xcite .",
    "here our major focus is an examination of the excitation and infrared radiative transfer of water vapor in the surface layers of protoplanetary disk .",
    "we find that water vapor must be strongly depleted from the surface over a significant range of radii .",
    "this can be due to a chemical effect , as water is less efficiently formed at temperatures @xmath11  k @xcite ; but we speculate that additional depletion is active due to vertical gas diffusion , followed by freeze - out below the snow line and settling to the mid - plane on icy dust grains .",
    "this process is analogous to the radial cold finger effect proposed by @xcite , but will not be balanced by the inward radial migration of icy bodies @xcite . to distinguish it from the radial cold finger effect , we call it the _ vertical cold finger effect _ ( see section [ fiducial_model_description ] ) .    to place the non - lte model into context ,",
    "we first describe slab models of disk infrared emission and the collisional / radiative excitation of water .",
    "the details of the statistical equilibrium calculations are then presented , along with our initial results and general conclusions .",
    "the models presented here are meant only to provide a fundamental analysis of the global properties of water vapor emission from disks , the more elaborate parameter study of the water excitation model that is needed to fit the spitzer irs spectra of individual sources is postponed to a separate paper ( meijerink et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "recent papers from @xcite and @xcite have been successful in obtaining good matches to h@xmath0o line observations in the mid - infrared ( mir ) _ spitzer_-irs band ( @xmath12 m ) using single temperature , single column density lte models with no global kinematics , such as keplerian motion .",
    "these fits have been used to provide numerical estimates of the warm water column densities . since a key point of this work",
    "is to show why non - lte calculations are required to quantitatively interpret the observed molecular line spectra of the warm inner regions of protoplanetary disks , particularly the emission from h@xmath0o , we first examine the successes and limitations of lte ` slab ' models .",
    "we will argue below that taking the properties derived from such models at face value is dangerous and may well lead to erroneous conclusions when attempting to compare abundances with chemical models . specifically , a good fit in a given wavelength range does not imply that the fitting model is correct .",
    "the low resolution of the _ spitzer _ spectra , and the resulting lack of line profile information , introduce significant degeneracies , as we discuss next .",
    "we will then show that the introduction of relatively simple physics lead to constraints not available from slab models , and that a requirement to match all lines in the observed _ spitzer _ range can significantly constrain the results .",
    "although the lineshapes also contain a great deal of info , it is not considered here , since the irs has a resolution of @xmath13 ( 500 km / s ) .",
    "slab models ignore the complex geometric structure of protoplanetary disks . in the inner regions",
    ", densities can be as high as @xmath14  @xmath15 in the midplane and at small radii ( @xmath16  au ) , but decrease with radius and height ( see fig .",
    "[ timescale_comp ] ) over many orders of magnitude to densities @xmath17  @xmath15 .",
    "gas temperatures can be as high as @xmath18 in the upper reaches of the disk atmosphere where the x - ray @xcite or fuv @xcite attenuation is minimal .",
    "the temperature drops steadily in the shielded regions of the disk to values of @xmath19  k , where the gas temperature couples strongly to the dust temperature .",
    "therefore , the disk consists of an ensemble of densities and temperatures .",
    "lines are , in general , the result of emission from a range of disk radii , and thus can not be represented by a single excitation temperature . the mid - infrared wavelength region contains radiative transitions from upper levels with an enormous range of energies , from values at / near the photon energy ( @xmath20  k or 500  @xmath21 ) to values in excess of @xmath22  k or 5000  @xmath21 .",
    "the conversion between wavenumber and temperature units is 1.44 .",
    "temperature units are used throughout this paper . for a light",
    ", asymmetric top molecule , such as h@xmath0o , transitions with various upper state energies can be highly scattered throughout the spectrum , and even a small spectral region can contain lines that trace very different regions of the disk . therefore , the assumption that all lines are formed in the same region of the disk is immediately seen to be inappropriate  and can easily lead to an erroneous determination of the line optical depth in a slab model .",
    "in fact , it is essentially meaningless to even assign an optical depth to a given line , since emission from different disk radii will have local optical depths varying by orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , lte assumes that the level populations are in accordance with the maxwell - boltzmann distribution at a particular temperature .",
    "this only holds when collisions dominate the molecular excitation / relaxation , or numerically when the ambient densities are higher than the critical densities @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the radiative and collisional decay rates of a particular transition .",
    "the critical densities for the excitation of the water lines through collisions range between @xmath26 to @xmath27  @xmath15 , and tend to increase strongly with excitation energy .",
    "pure rotational transitions with low excitation energies , which lie in the frequency range of the heterodyne instrument for the far - infrared ( hifi ) on the herschel space observatory ( _ herschel _ ) , have critical densities in the range @xmath28  @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , these lines will likely be difficult to observe toward disks with hifi for sensitivity reasons @xcite .",
    "_ spitzer_-irs ( @xmath29  @xmath1 m range ) data , on the contrary , have shown rich spectra of warm water in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks .",
    "these consist of rotational transitions with even larger critical densities than the hifi lines and are therefore unlikely to be thermalized .",
    "lower excitation lines of a given species tend to have lower critical densities , and as a result , lines with lower excitation energies will trace larger regions of the disk .",
    "it is therefore expected that the line shapes and line images will differ significantly from one transition to another .",
    "thus , _ future spectrally and spatially resolved data will be crucial for constraining the water abundance structure _ , and should be interpreted with tools that specifically model ( or mimic ) the physical and chemical properties of the disk .",
    "there are a number of ways to excite water to higher energy states : 1 ) collisions with , e.g. , h , h@xmath0 , he , and electrons ; 2 ) excitation by radiation produced by hot dust located at the inner rim of the disk ; 3 ) photo - desorption from dust grains ; and 4 ) chemical formation in highly excited states . in this paper , we only take into account 1 ) and 2 ) . for this study all hydrogen is assumed to be in molecular form , and he excitation is considered by scaling the molecular hydrogen rates .",
    "electron excitation is neglected , since electrons are expected to be abundant only in unshielded low density regions , where water is subthermally excited and its fractional abundance very low , which therefore do not contribute much to the overall line emission .",
    "water lines in the @xmath30 m wavelength range covered by the _ spitzer_-irs short - high ( sh ) and long - high ( lh ) modules are overwhelmingly dominated by pure rotational transitions between levels in the ground ( @xmath31)=(000 ) vibrational state as well as between those in the first vibrational state ( @xmath31)=(010 ) .",
    "further , for a non - lte calculation , transitions that connect the two vibrational levels must also be considered .",
    "given the widespread importance of water , there have been significant efforts to calculate the h@xmath0o excitation rates  both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "unfortunately , most studies only give state - to - state rate coefficients below the first excited vibrational level , i.e , below @xmath32  k @xcite .",

    "smaller rates , which also include the rovibrational excitation / de - excitation , are expected to be accurate to an order of magnitude . summed rates and cooling rates",

    "therefore , the calculation of these rates is important for future modeling .    to limit the computational load , the non - lte calculation",

    "it can be seen that the excluded vibrational levels contain lines that are weaker by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude relative to lines in the vibrational levels modeled . at the _ spitzer_-irs sh+lh spectral resolution of r=600 , these lines are unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall spectrum .",

    ". the dust sublimation temperature is set at @xmath59  k , giving a radius of the inner rim of @xmath60  au .",
    "in addition to parameters determining the dust structure of the disk , a number of parameters are needed for the line modeling .",
    "these are the prescription of the intrinsic line width , the freeze - out model , the fractional h@xmath0o abundance and the gas temperature and density structure .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic linewidth throughout the grid is determined by thermal broadening ( @xmath61 ) , and turbulent broadening , assumed to be a fraction of the sound speed @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is adopted in this paper .",

    "the overall line spectrum does not change drastically in the _ spitzer _ range with freeze - out added ( especially in the non - lte case ) .",

    "furthermore , the line - to - continuum ratio is still a factor of 3 - 5 too low with respect to representative _",
    "irs spectra .",
    "for instance ,",
    "the prominent 33@xmath1 m line complex now has a line to continuum ratio of 0.05:1 at _",
    "spitzer_-irs resolution , compared to observed values of @xmath690.1 - 0.2:1 .    in order to increase the general line - to - continuum ratio , model 4",
    "is introduced , which is the same as model 3 , except that the gas - to - dust ratio has been increased by factor of 10 to simulate strong dust settling .",
    "the result is that higher gas densities contribute near the disk surface leading to increased line intensities , coupled with a decrease in the dust continuum .",
    "this model shows a much better agreement with observations , but many low excitation lines are now too bright .",
    "furthermore , the line spectrum shows a strong increase in peak line strength with wavelength , in contradiction with the observed , almost flat , line integrated intensities .",
    "the reason that the low excitation lines are bright is that they are produced over a wide range of radii in the disk .",
    "hence , they can be suppressed if the water vapor abundance is drastically lowered beyond a certain radius .",
    "_ static _ chemical models do predict that the water abundance is lowered by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude at temperatures below @xmath119k , which might be enough to reproduce some of the observed line spectra , but due to the high optical depths that remain at low temperature , the data indicate that higher depletions may be necessary . thus , other mechanisms should be investigated .",
    "@xcite suggested that water vapor ( and therefore oxygen ) is depleted from the inner disk , within the midplane snow line , on time scales shorter than the life time of the disk . in this mechanism",
    "the water vapor is transported from just within the snow line ( closer to the central star ) to just outside the snow line by turbulent diffusion , at which point the water freezes out .",
    "essentially , the sharp change in the partial pressure of water vapor across the snow line results in a net flux of water molecules outwards in the disk .",
    "however , this radial `` cold finger '' effect is likely balanced by the inward migration of icy bodies , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the radial cold finger effect assumes that the snow line is a vertical line in an isothermal disk .",
    "however , due to the temperature inversion in the disk atmosphere @xcite , the snow line is actually a curve that becomes almost parallel to the disk surface over a very wide range of the disk , typically the entire planet - forming region ( 0.5 - 20  au ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ timescale_comp ] , and is sketched in fig .",
    "[ vert_coldfinger ] .",
    "hence , near the surface , the cold finger effect will operate in the vertical direction ; water vapor will diffuse via turbulence to regions below the snow line where it will freeze out and take part in the general settling of dust to the midplane in a process one might call the `` vertical cold finger '' effect .",
    "the important difference relative to the _ radial _ cold finger effect is that in the surface water vapor abundance will not be replenished by the migration ( in the case , the relofting ) of solids if icy dust grains grow to significant size as they settle and as seems to be required by the significant millimeter - wave fluxes of many disks , particularly those that are referred to as transitional disks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "further , the turbulence will be higher in the surface , thus shortening the water depletion time scale .",
    "therefore , we speculate that such a mechanism is an effective means of depleting surface water _ above the midplane snow line_. if true , this would be of considerable importance because it would mean that the radial distribution of surface water , as observed with _",
    "spitzer_-irs and future mid- to far - infrared facilities , may well trace the midplane snow line .",
    "more detailed modeling is needed to estimate whether the time scales for this proposed process are short enough to operate efficiently .",
    "it can be noted that a vertical cold finger effect truncation above the snow line at @xmath2au neatly explains why the slab models fit so well when assuming the same emitting area for all water lines over a wide range of excitation energies . in this way ,",
    "the water emission radius derived from slab models may in fact be a measure of the location of the midplane snow line .    in model 5",
    "we mimic the vertical cold finger effect by setting the water abundance to the freeze - out abundance ( @xmath120 ) above the midplane snow line of the disk , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vert_coldfinger ] .",
    "the resulting spectrum shows that the line spectrum has significantly flattened , in general agreement with the observed water spectra ( see also fig .",
    "[ bracket ] ) .",
    "driven by the recent detection of hundreds of water emission lines in the mid - infrared from disks around t tauri stars by @xcite and @xcite , a non - lte 2d model has been constructed that qualitatively reproduces the observed spectra .",
    "the model can be adjusted to obtain detailed fits to individual mid - infrared spectra .",
    "our approach is to derive an abundance structure for water based on observational constraints , rather than use the prediction of existing chemistry or transport models . as a demonstration of this technique",
    ", the action of a vertical cold finger effect is proposed to model the observed truncation of the surface abundance of water vapor .",
    "\\1 ) a non - thermal excitation treatment of water is essential in determining the water distribution given an observed mid - infrared water spectrum . assuming lte in the calculation of h@xmath0o line spectra is generally invalid , especially for high excitation lines",
    "this is best illustrated in fig .",
    "[ weighted_columns ] and [ panel_spectra ] .",
    "the critical densities for exciting the water lines in the 10 to 36@xmath1 m region range from @xmath121  @xmath6 , and rapidly increase with the upper level energy . in models 1 and 2 ,",
    "the difference between the lte and non - lte dominant line intensities is a factor of 2 to 3 . in these models ,",
    "the gas temperature is assumed to be equal to that of the dust , leading to faint high excitation lines . in model 3 ,",
    "the surface gas temperature is increased using a parametrization based on detailed models of the gas heating @xcite .",
    "the emission of especially the low excitation lines is now boosted by a thin layer of warm h@xmath0o in the upper part of the disk with lower densities , leading to a much larger discrepancy between the non - lte and lte case due to subthermal excitation .",
    "to boost the line - to - continuum ratio even more , the gas - to - dust ratio in models 4 and 5 was increased by a factor of 10 with respect to model 1 through 3 .",
    "the low excitation lines in model 4 now become too bright and therefore a speculative vertical cold finger effect was added in model 5 . in this case , the difference between the lte and non - lte spectrum is minimized because the regions of the disk that have the largest deviation from lte contain little / no water vapor . in summary , beyond a radius @xmath122  au , levels having transitions in the _ spitzer _ irs wavelength range are sub - thermally excited , leading to biased estimates of the temperature and density distribution , emitting areas and interpretation of high resolution ( @xmath123  km / s ) line profiles when using lte models .",
    "\\2 ) in order to obtain more line emission from high excitation water lines ( @xmath124  k ) , we introduced a steep gas temperature increase at high altitudes in the disk , which is motivated by both observations and models of , e.g. , the [ neii ] 12.81  @xmath1 m and [ oi ] 6300    lines .",
    "this increases the line strenghts by 20 - 100 percent , and the low excitation lines are boosted most .",
    "this is not enough , however , to reproduce the observed _ spitzer _ irs line - to - continuum ratios .",
    "\\3 ) the gas - to - dust ratio must be increased by one to two orders of magnitude with respect to the canonical ism ratio of @xmath125 in order to approach the observed line strengths and line - to - continuum ratios .",
    "an increase in gas - to - dust ratio lowers the dust opacity , allowing lines to be formed at higher densities deeper in the disk .",
    "an increase in the apparent gas - to - dust ratio can be explained by grain growth and dust settling .",
    "increasing the gas - to - dust ratio is a more efficient way to increase line - to - continuum ratios than the decoupling of gas from dust at high altitudes in the disk because the former modification emphasizes high density gas .",
    "\\4 ) chemical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that it is possible to obtain high water abundances in the transition zone from hot ( @xmath97  k ) to cold gas ( @xmath126  k ) and that the range along the vertical axis where the maximum abundance occurs becomes smaller with radius . below this vertical zone , closer to the midplane ,",
    "water is less efficiently formed because the neutral - neutral reactions that form it ( o + h@xmath0 @xmath127",
    "oh + h followed by oh + h@xmath0 @xmath127 h@xmath0o + h ) contain activation barriers .",
    "even so , the predicted lower limit to the water abundance ( @xmath128 ) , or a suppression by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude , still produces too much emission in the optically thick low excitation lines .",
    "rather , a sharp drop in the surface water abundance by up to 4 orders of magnitude beyond @xmath2au better reproduces the observations .",
    "this sharp drop is difficult to explain with only static chemical models , although it is not completely ruled out that additional chemical porcesses could effectively reduce the water abundance .",
    "we speculate a vertical cold finger effect , a process in which water vapor is diffusively transported in the vertical direction to a point below the snow line where the water freezes out and takes part in the general growth and settling of solids to the midplane , may provide a viable explanation ( fig .",
    "[ vert_coldfinger ] ) .",
    "if this effect does occur and is efficient , the radial distribution of water line emission from the disk surface can become a direct tracer of the location of the midplane snow line",
    ".    a chemical suppression of the water abundance , as compared a vertical cold finger process would give rise to two completely different disk surface chemistries as a function of radius that can be tested observationally : if vertical transport is not important and chemical processes along determine the surface water abundance , the chemistry is oxygen dominated .",
    "conversely , a vertical cold finger effect will dramatically reduce the total oxygen abundance in the surface , giving rise a carbon - dominated chemistry resulting in very different radial distributions of organics and other species as observed in mid - infrared surface molecular tracers . to test this , sensitive high resolution mid - infrared spectroscopy",
    "is required , such as will be offered by the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) and the next generation of extremely large telescopes ( elts ) , combined with detailed excitation modeling .",
    "the present study has qualitatively determined the water temperature and abundance distribution required to explain observed mid - infrared spectra of t tauri disks . however ,",
    "several important aspects that may contribute to the formation and appearance of mid - infrared water lines from protoplanetary disks are not discussed in this paper .",
    "\\(i ) intrinsic line broadening :",
    "here we adopted an intrinsic linewidth that is dominated by thermal broadening .",
    "it is possible that additional broadening from mri driven turbulence would be able to double the intrinsic linewidth , although the small predicted values for turbulent viscosities would indicate that intrinsic line widths are indeed dominated by thermal broadening .",
    "an increase of the intrinsic line broadening would reduce the opacities in the lines , thus increasing the effective critical densities , leading to lowered intensities of the high excitation lines .",
    "\\(ii ) stellar properties : the central stars in the observed _ spitzer _ sample have masses ranging @xmath129 to @xmath130  m@xmath47 , and ages ranging from 1 to 10 myrs , corresponding to luminosities and effective temperatures ranging from @xmath131 to @xmath132  l@xmath47 and @xmath133  k , respectively .",
    "the modeling presented here has not explored dependencies on the properties of the central star .",
