    "the occurrence of spin - glass long - range order @xcite , ground - state entropy @xcite , and chaotic rescaling behavior @xcite has long been discussed in spin - glass systems , with reference to spatial dimensionality @xmath8 , interaction randomness and frustration @xcite , accepted as inherent to spin - glass systems and spin - glass order . in ising models with randomly distributed nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions on hypercubic lattices , it has been shown that a spin - glass phase does not occur in @xmath2 and does occur in @xmath1.@xcite in these hypercubic systems , frustration occurs in elementary squares with an odd number of antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "thus , with interactions randomly distributed with no correlation , maximally 50 % of the elementary squares can be frustrated .",
    "this fraction increases from zero as the concentration of frozen antiferromagnetic bonds @xmath0 is increased from zero and reaches its maximal value of 50 % at @xmath7 .",
    "the basis of the current study is the realization that , for any value of the antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath9 , the fraction of frustrated squares can be varied considerably . for example , for the square lattice , for @xmath10 , the fraction of frustrated squares can be made to vary to any value between 0 and 1 inclusive , by the locally correlated occurrence quenched random bonds . for @xmath11",
    ", the fraction of frustrated squares can similarly be made to vary between 0 and @xmath12 . for @xmath13",
    ", the fraction of frustrated squares can be made to vary between 0 and @xmath14 .",
    "( thus , frustration reaches 0 with no variation as @xmath0 approaches 0 or 1 . )",
    "examples are shown in fig . 1 for @xmath7 .",
    "thus , when the fraction of frustrated squares is zero , we have a so - called mattis spin glass @xcite . at the other extreme",
    ", we have a fully frustrated system @xcite .",
    "all frustration values in between can be obtained , by randomly removing or adding local frustration without changing the antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    in this study",
    ", we have implemented an exact renormalization - group study for ising spin - glass models on the hierarchical lattices , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively shown in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 3(b ) , for arbitrary overfrustration or underfrustration implemented by locally correlated quenched randomness .",
    "we have calculated 18 complete phase diagrams , each for a different frustration level , in temperature and antiferromagnetic bond probability @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the increase of frustration disfavors the spin - glass phase ( while at low temperatures favoring the spin - glass phase at the expense of the ferromagnetic phase and , symmetrically , antiferromagnetic phase . ) both in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the spin - glass phase disappears at zero temperature when a certain level of frustration is reached .",
    "however , this disappearance of the spin - glass phase happens in different regimes in @xmath1 and @xmath2 : for @xmath1 , it occurs in overfrustration , so that at stochastic frustration ( no correlation in randomness ) a spin - glass phase occurs . for @xmath2",
    ", it already occurs in underfrustration , so that at stochastic frustration a spin - glass phase does not occur .",
    "however , with frustration only partially removed , we find that a spin - glass phase certainly does occur in @xmath2 .",
    "the chaotic rescaling @xcite of the interactions within the spin - glass phase occurs as soon as frustration is increased from zero , both in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have calculated the lyapunov exponent @xmath3 @xcite of the renormalization - group trajectory of the interaction at a given location , when the system is in the spin - glass phase . when frustration is increased from zero , the lyapunov exponent @xmath3 increases from zero , both in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior is of course consistent with the chaotic renormalization - group trajectories .",
    "different values of the positive lyapunov exponents characterize different spin - glass phases .",
    "it is found here that the value of the lyapunov exponent continuously varies with the level of frustration and is different for each dimensionality @xmath8 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent does not depend on antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath0 or temperature .",
    "our calculations with varying frustration also yield information on long- and short - range ordering , and entropy .",
    "the increase in frustration lowers both the onset temperature of long - range order and the characteristic temperature of short - range order , but affects long - range order much more drastically , thus interchanging the two temperatures and eventually eliminating long - range spin - glass order .",
    "for @xmath1 , for low frustration , the specific heat peak occurs inside the spin - glass phase , indicating that considerable short - range disorder persists into the higher temperatures of the spin - glass phase . in these cases , as temperature is lowered , spin - glass long - range order onsets before the system is predominantly short - range ordered . as frustration is increased , both ordering temperatures are lowered , but differently , so that they interchange before stochastic frustration is reached .",
    "thus , for overfrustration , stochastic frustration , and higher frustration values of underfrustration , the specific heat peak occurs outside the spin - glass phase , indicating that as temperature is lowered , short - range order sets before long - range order ( which reaches zero temperature in overfrustration ) .",
    "zero - temperature or low - temperature entropy is a distinctive character of systems with frustration .",
    "frustration is introduced into the system , by increasing from zero the antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath0 .",
    "it is seen that frustration favors the spin - glass phase over the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "however , it is also seen that , in all cases that frustration is introduced , the major portion of the entropy is created with the ferromagnetic phase as opposed to the spin - glass phase .",
    "the ising spin - glass model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 , at each site @xmath17 of a lattice the spin @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes that the sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites .",
    "the bond strengths @xmath20 are @xmath21 ( ferromagnetic ) with probability @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( antiferromagnetic ) with probability @xmath0 . on hypercubic lattices , in any elementary square with an odd number number of antiferromagnetic bonds , all bonds can not be simultaneously satisfied , meaning that there is frustration.@xcite when the antiferromagnetic bonds are randomly distributed with probability @xmath0 across the lattice , a fraction @xmath24 of the elementary squares is frustrated .",
    "this system with uncorrelated quenched randomness is the usually studied spin - glass system and we shall refer to it as a * stochastically frustrated * system . on the other hand , by changing the signs of individual bonds @xmath25 at randomly chosen localities , with the rule that , for every ferromagnetic - to - antiferromagnetic local change , an antiferromagnetic - to - ferromagnetic local change is done , frustration can be continuously increased or decreased from the value in eq.(2 ) , without changing the antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath0 .",
    "we call the systems in which frustration is thus increased or decreased from stochastic frustration , respectively , * overfrustrated * or * underfrustrated * systems .",

    "the starting bimodal quenched probability distribution of the interactions , characterized by @xmath0 and described above , is not conserved under rescaling .",
    "the renormalized quenched probability distribution of the interactions is obtained by the convolution @xcite @xmath33 } \\delta(j'_{i'j'}-r(\\left\\{j_{ij}\\right\\})),\\ ] ] where the primes denote the renormalized system and @xmath34 represents the bond moving and decimation given in eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) . for numerical practicality ,",
    "the bond moving and decimation of eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) are achieved by a sequence of pairwise combination of interactions , as shown for @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 3(c ) , each pairwise combination leading to an intermediate probability distribution resulting from a pairwise convolution as in eq.(5 ) .",
    "we implement this procedure numerically in two calculationally equivalent ways : ( 1 ) the quenched probability distribution is represented by histograms.@xcite a total number of between 500 to 2,500 histograms , depending on the needed accuracy , is used here .",
    "this total number is distributed between ferromagnetic @xmath35 and antiferromagnetic @xmath36 interactions according to the total probabilities for each case .",
    "( 2 ) by generating a cohort of 20,000 interactions @xcite that embodies the quenched probability distribution . at each pairwise convolution as in eq.(5 ) , 20,000 randomly chosen pairs are matched by eq.(3 ) or ( 4 ) , and a new set of 20,000 is produced .",
    "the numerical convergence of the histogram and cohort implementations are determined , respectively , by the numbers of histograms and cohort members . at numerical convergence , the results of the two implementations match .",
    "the histogram method is faster and is used to calculate phase diagrams , thermodynamic properties , and asymptotic fixed distributions .",
    "the cohort method is needed for studying the repeated rescaling behavior of the interaction at a specific location on the lattice and is used to calculate chaotic trajectories , chaotic bands , and lyapunov exponents.@xcite      hierarchical models are models which are exactly soluble by renormalization - group theory.@xcite hierarchical lattices have therefore been used to study a variety of spin - glass and other statistical mechanics problems.@xcite hierarchical models can be constructed @xcite that have identical renormalization - group recursion relations with the approximate treatment of models on hypercubic and other euclidian lattices .",
    "thus , figs .",
    "2(b ) and 3(b ) respectively give the hierarchical models , used in our study , that have the same recursion relations as the migdal - kadanoff approximation @xcite for the hypercubic lattice in @xmath1 ( cubic lattice ) and @xmath2 ( square lattice ) .",
    "overfrustration or underfrustration is readily introduced into hierarchical lattices by randomly changing local interactions or groups of local interactions , while conserving @xmath0 .",
    "this overfrustration or underfrustration affects the pairwise bond - moving step of the renormalization - group solution . in the case of overfrustration ,",
    "when two bonds are matched for bond - moving , bonds of the same sign are accepted with a probability @xmath37 , @xmath38 . clearly , when @xmath39 , we have not altered the occurrence of frustration .",
    "but , for a value of @xmath37 in the range @xmath40 , we have removed a fraction @xmath41 of the unfrustrated occurrences .    similarly , in the case of underfrustration , when two bonds are matched for bond - moving , bonds of the opposite sign are accepted with a probability @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "again , when @xmath44 , we have not altered the occurrence of frustration .",
    "but , for a value of @xmath42 in the range @xmath43 , we have removed a fraction @xmath45 of the frustrated occurrences .",
    "we have thus defined the degree of frustration on the hierarchical models .",
    "accordingly , full frustration , stochastic frustration , and zero frustration respectively correspond to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . our implementation of underfrustration and overfrustration via the factors @xmath42 and @xmath37 does affect , on the hierarchical lattice , the effective value of the antiferromagnetic bond probability @xmath0 as @xmath49 @xmath50 includes the combined effect of @xmath0 together with the local quenched correlation rule controlled by @xmath42 or @xmath37 .",
    "( the actual microscopic renormalization - group calculation is of course done using @xmath0 with the quenched correlation rule , which completely defines the model . )",
    "eqs.(6 ) directly follow from the acceptance rules given in the previous two paragraphs : the second terms in the numerators subtract the probability due to rejection because of a bond - moving match that is suppressed ; the denominator is a normalization taking into account this rejection probability .",
    "thus , @xmath7 , the center of a would - be spin - glass phase , is not affected . for other values",

    "lower panel : the calculated derivative of the entropy per site @xmath93 as a function of the antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath0 at temperature @xmath87 , for the stochastic frustration system @xmath92 in @xmath1 . the tick mark shows the phase transition point between the ferromagnetic phase and the spin - glass phase .",
    "the peak being inside the ferromagnetic phase shows that short - range disorder sets inside the ferromagnetic phase . ]",
    "this study has started upon the realization that in ising spin glasses , frustration can be adjusted continuously and , if needed , considerably , without changing the antiferromagnetic bond probability @xmath0 , by using locally correlated quenched randomness , as we demonstrated here on hypercubic lattices and hierarchical lattices .",
    "thus , a rich variety of new spin - glass models and spin - glass phases was created .",
    "such overfrustrated and underfrustrated systems on hierarchical lattices in @xmath1 and 2 were studied in detail , yielding new information and insights . with the removal of just 51% of frustration @xmath94",
    ", a spin - glass phase appears in @xmath2 . with the addition of just 33% frustration @xmath95",
    ", the spin - glass phase disappears in @xmath1 .",
    "sequences of phase diagrams for different levels of frustration have been calculated in both dimensions . in general , frustration lowers the spin - glass ordering temperature . at low temperatures , frustration favors the spin - glass phase ( before it disappears ) over the ferromagnetic phase and symmetrically the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "when any amount , including infinitesimal , frustration is introduced , the chaotic rescaling of local interactions occurs in the spin - glass phase .",
    "chaos increases with increasing frustration , as seen from the increased positive value of the calculated lyapunov exponent , starting from zero when frustration is absent .",
    "the calculated runaway exponent of the renormalization - group flows decreases , from @xmath61 with increasing frustration to @xmath6 when the spin - glass phase disappears .    from our calculations of entropy and specific heat curves in @xmath1",
    ", it is seen that frustration lowers in temperature the onset of both long- and short - range order in spin - glass phases , but is more effective on the former .",
    "thus , for highly overfrustrated cases , considerable short - range order occurs in the lower temperature range of the paramagnetic phase , whereas for moderately overfrustrated , stochastically frustrated , and underfrustrated cases , considerable short - range disorder occurs in the higher temperature of the spin - glass phase . from calculations of the entropy and its derivative as a function of antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath0",
    ", it is seen that the ground - state and low - temperature entropy already mostly sets in within the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases , before the spin - glass phase is reached .",
    "it is hoped that these calculational results , strictly valid for hierarchical lattices but suggestive for hypercubic lattices , would be repeated by monte carlo simulation , or other methods , for hypercubic lattices , as we have demonstrated the preparation of overfrustrated and underfrustrated hypercubic lattices .",
