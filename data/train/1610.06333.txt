    "ultra luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; makishima et al  2000 ) are unusually luminous x - ray point sources that are often found at places of enhanced star formation , e.g. , arms of spiral galaxies .",
    "their luminosity , @xmath11 erg s@xmath5 , significantly exceeds the eddington limit of a stellar mass ( @xmath12 ) black hole ( bh ) , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) erg s@xmath5 , where @xmath15 is the bh mass and @xmath16 is the solar mass . since their first discovery with the einstein observatory ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1989 ) , ulxs had remained mysterious objects for more than two decades .",
    "when the wide band spectroscopy of ulxs became available with asca , their spectra turned out to be explicable with the multi - color disk ( mcd ; mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 , makishima et al .  1986 ) model , which represents multi - temperature blackbody radiation from a standard accretion disk around accreting objects ( makishima et al .",
    "this implies their close resemblance to ordinary bh binaries ( bhbs ) . in order to reconcile their high luminosities with the relatively high inner - disk temperature ( @xmath17 kev )",
    "obtained with the mcd - model fitting , makishima et al .",
    "( 2000 ) proposed that ulxs are intermediate mass ( @xmath18 ) bhs with significant angular momentum , radiating at or somewhat below than their eddington luminosities .    the existence of such relatively heavy ( @xmath19 ) bhs has been clearly demonstrated by the epoch - making detection of the gravitational - wave event , gw 150914 ( abbott et al .",
    "2016 ) , in which two bhb with @xmath20 merged into one with @xmath21 . although the formation scenario of these @xmath20 bhs in binaries is yet to be identified ( cf .",
    "ebisuzaki et al .",
    "2001 ; kinugawa et al .",
    "2014 ) , the merger remnant could eventually become a ulx , even without a mass - donating companion , through direct accretion from thick interstellar matter ( mii & totani 2005 ; section 2 ) .",
    "this gives a support to the interpretation of ulxs in terms of intermediate - mass bhs .",
    "in paralllel with the above approach , the puzzling properties of ulxs motivated alternative interpretations to be proposed and extensively developed .",
    "for example , king et al .  ( 2001 ) argued that ulxs are stellar - mass bhs with their emission highly collimated towards us .",
    "similarly , some authors ( e.g. watarai et al .  2000 ; mineshige & ohsuga  2007 ) pointed out that the eddington limit can be surpassed in an accretion disk system , which is predominantly axi - symmetric , and adopted an accretion disk model called slim - disk model to explain the mcd - like spectra .",
    "this model describes emission from optically - thick super - critical accretion flows with strong advection , and predicts mcd - like spectra with considerably higher temperatures .",
    "they hence concluded that the high @xmath22 spectra are due to super critical accretion flows , and ulxs harbor stellar - mass bhs instead of intermediate ones .",
    "actually , this viewpoint has become very popular both observationally and theoretically ( e.g. , middleton et al .",
    "2011 , ohsuga & mineshige  2011 , sutton et al .",
    "2013 , middleton et al .",
    "2015 ) . in any event",
    ", it still remains controversial whether ulxs are considerably more massive than the stellar - mass bhs , or are in the state of significant super - eddington emission ( either apparently or intrinsically ) .",
    "thanks to extensive studies with many x - ray observatories , ulxs have been found to show two characteristic spectral states ( e.g. gladstone et al .",
    "2009 , pintore et al .",
    "2014 , luangtip et al .",
    "one is the mcd - like state mentioned above , while the other is power - law ( pl ) like state .",
    "although the pl - state spectra were at first represented by a single pl , two features were noticed as the observation made a progress .",
    "one is a mild cutoff above @xmath23 kev ( kubota , done & makishima  2002 ) , suggestive of thermal comptonization ( thc ) process .",
    "the other is soft excess  often seen below 1.5 kev of these spectra ( gladstone et al .",
    "2009 ) , which suggests the presence of an optically - thick emission that is cooler ( @xmath24 kev ) than those describing the mcd - state spectra .",
    "in fact , the x - ray spectra of these ulxs were well reproduced by assuming a corona that is partially covering an optically - thick source .",
    "specifically , it is assumed that some fraction of the optically - thick emission is directly visible as the soft excess , and the rest is up - scattered via the thc to form the pl continuum .",
    "the optically - thick emission could be coming from an accretion disk ( mcd+thc modeling ; dewangan et al .",
    "2006 , goad et al .",
    "2006 , gladstone et al .",
    "2009 , miyawaki et al .",
    "2009 , pintore et al .",
    "2014 ) , or alternatively from other sources such as photosphere of optically thick outflows ( middleton et al .",
    "2011 ) .    while the above mcd+thc model is similar to a modeling which is often used in bhbs ( kubota et al .",
    "2001 , mcconnell et al .",
    "2002 ) , the ulx spectra exhibit significantly lower coronal temperature , @xmath25 kev , compared to those of bhbs in the low / hard states ( @xmath26 kev ; e.g. makishima et al .",
    "2008 , yamada et al .",
    "2013 ) or very high states ( @xmath27 few tens kev ; e.g. kubota & done  2004 ) .",
    "some works on computational simulations suggest that these low temperature coronae can be identified with optically thick cool outflows launched from super - critical accretion flows onto stellar - mass bhs ( e.g. ohsuga et al .",
    "2003 , kawashima et al .",
    "2012 ) , which should bear rich features of x - ray reprocessing , including photoelectric absorption , fluorescence lines , and resonant absorption lines ( e.g. hagino et al .",
    "however , the actually observed ulx spectra are extremely featureless , posing another puzzle .    to better understand ulxs",
    ", we examine whether the pl - like spectra are explicable as an extension of ordinary sub - eddington modeling developed through the past bhb studies .",
    "specifically , we apply the mcd+thc modeling to some ulx spectra and examine the results for consistency with those on bhbs . since our study requires as high statistics as possible , we selected in the present paper the representative ulx , holmberg ( hol ) ix x-1 , which is one of the brightest of these x - ray sources .",
    "hol ix x-1 is a ulx in the irregular dwarf galaxy hol ix , which is associated with the nearby spiral galaxy m81 ( ngc 3031 ) at a distance of 3.4 mpc ( georgiev et al .",
    "it is the brightest x - ray source ( @xmath28 erg s@xmath5 at @xmath3 kev ) within @xmath29 of the m81 nucleus except the nucleus itself , and has been studied extensively .",
    "its spectra obtained by asca and xmm - newton , in 1998 and 2001 respectively , were explained with emission from an accretion disk with a high inner temperature as @xmath30 kev ( tsunoda et al .",
    "2006 , la parola et al .",
    "2001 ) ; these data provide typical examples of the mcd - like spectra of ulxs . after these observations , the source has in contrast been residing in the pl state , wherein the spectrum can be explained with the mcd+thc modeling ( e.g. dewangan et al .",
    "2006 , vierdayanti et al .  2010 ) as described in section 1 .    in an attempt to detect any evidence for outflows , walton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) conducted the historically deepest observation of hol ix x-1 in 2012 with suzaku , utilizing its higher energy resolution and lower background around @xmath31 kev than any other x - ray observatories operating at that time . in spite of this effort",
    ", they failed to detect significant local spectral features , and obtained a stringent upper limit of 30 ev for any narrow absorption or emission line around @xmath31 kev ( walton et al .",
    "2013 ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we re - analyzed the same suzaku data to study the variability of spectral continuum of hol ix x-1 .    as already described by walton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the observation was carried out on 2012 april 13 - 17 for a net exposure of 183 ks , and again on 2012 october 24 - 28 for 217 ks .",
    "the @xmath32 months separation between the two observations allows us to study possible long - term variations of the source . in both these observations ,",
    "the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) were operated normally .",
    "front - illuminated ( fi ) ccd cameras ( xis0 and xis3 ) of the xis , and the back - illuminated ( bi ) one ( xis1 ) , were both operated in their standard modes , with charge injection , but without window option .",
    "the source was placed at the xis nominal  position in the xis field of view .",
    "since the hxd data were heavily contaminated by x - rays from the m81 nucleus ( dewangan et al .",
    "2013 ) , we utilize only the xis data in the present paper .",
    "figure [ fig : xisimg ] gives the background - inclusive @xmath33 kev image of xis3 .",
    "the source region was thus defined as a @xmath34-radius circle centered on the source , and the background region as an annulus of the inner and outer radii of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we excluded a rectangular region in figure [ fig : xisimg ] where some dead columns exist in xis0 , and a small circle region where a faint x - ray point source is present . at the right bottom of the field of view , we notice some stray light from the m81 nucleus .",

    "the gross pointing thus lasted for @xmath37 ks in april and @xmath38 ks in october .",
    "as usual with suzaku observations , the net exposure is about @xmath39 of these values .",
    "while the hard - band ( @xmath40 kev ) light curve was nearly constant within @xmath41 throughout each observation , the others showed somewhat more enhanced variability .",
    "in addition , the average count rate increased from april to october by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , in the soft ( @xmath45 kev ) , middle ( @xmath46 kev ) , and the hard ( @xmath40 kev ) band , respectively . the actual flux increase ( section 3.3 ) ,",
    "however , is somewhat smaller then these , because the source position was slightly different between the two observations .",

    ", we summed the fi xis ( xis0 and xis3 ) spectra together , because they have almost the same instrumental response .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra obtained from the individual observations are presented in figure [ fig : powerratio ] . in order to grasp approximate shapes of the spectra",
    ", we took their ratios to a pl model with photon index of 2 . for simplicity ,",
    "only the fi xis spectra are shown , but those with bi xis are consistent .",
    "both spectra thus exhibit hard pl shapes with a turn over at @xmath0 kev , and a low energy break at @xmath47 kev due to absorption by intervening matter . as expected from the light curve , the @xmath48 kev flux increased in the 6 months , and made the spectrum somewhat softer in the october observation .    in order to study the characteristics of this spectral variability in more detail , but without using any physical model , we took ratios between the spectra on the two occasions , and present the result in figure [ fig : monthly ] . here",
    ", we also show the result from the bi xis , which is consistent with that from the fi xis .",
    "the ratio is relatively flat in @xmath8 kev , indicating that no significant change took place in the absorbing column density , and the spectral shape in @xmath8 kev remained unchanged as the luminosity varied . on the other hand ,",
    "the data points in @xmath7 kev form a straight pl form up to @xmath49 kev , where the spectra already start bending ( figure [ fig : powerratio ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the cutoff energy remained relatively unchanged between the two spectra , and mainly the slope changed .",
    "as presented in figure [ fig : apavesp ] , the derived xis spectra were quantified via model fitting .",
    "the april and october data were analyzed separately , whereas the xis fi and bi data were fitted jointly .",
    "since bi xis suffers higher background , we used a more limited energy band for its spectra ( @xmath50 kev in april , and @xmath51 kev in october ) than for the xis0 + 3 data ( @xmath52 kev ) .",
    "in addition , we excluded the @xmath53 kev band from our analysis , and multiplied a constant factor to the xis1 spectrum .",
    "these are intended to deal with uncertainties in the instrumental response around the si edge , and in the cross calibration among two type of ccds , respectively .",
    "our analysis was carried out by using the xspec ver 12.7.1 .    instead of immediately jumping onto the mcd+thc modeling described in section 1",
    ", we tried several spectral models with progressive complexity .",
    "based on the approximately pl - like spectral shape ( figure [ fig : powerratio ] ) , we first employed a cut - off pl ( @xmath54 ) model , multiplied by photoelectric absorption model @xmath55 ; this is called model 1 .",
    "we allowed the column density @xmath56 of the absorber to float .",
    "the fitting results are shown in table [ tb : avefitp ] for this and subsequent models , where the error refers to the @xmath57 confidence limits of each parameter .",
    "as shown in panels ( a1 ) and ( b1 ) of figure [ fig : apavesp ] , the spectra were approximately explained with this model , by photon indices of @xmath58 and cutoff energies of @xmath59 kev .",
    "however , the fit leaves some positive residuals in @xmath60 kev , which suggest that some fraction of emission from the accretion disk is reaching us directly .",
    "therefore we added an mcd component ( @xmath61 ) to the model , thus constructing model 2 .",
    "this @xmath61 component has two free parameters ; the inner - disk temperature @xmath22 and the apparent inner - disk radius @xmath62 , which are mainly determined by the peak energy of the soft excess component , and its flux , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the fit became acceptable in both data sets ( table [ tb : avefitp ] ) .",
    "the @xmath3 kev luminosity increased by @xmath63 from april to october as given in table [ tb : avefitp ] .",
    "since the soft excess is weak in the spectra ( figure [ fig : apavesp ] ) , @xmath61 is subject to rather large errors .",
    "since the cutoff - pl - shape continuum often arises via comptonization , we replaced @xmath54 with a thc code called @xmath64 ( zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz  1996 , zycki , done & smith  1999 ) .",
    "the seed - photon source of @xmath64 was chosen as another @xmath61 , of which the temperature is set identical to that of the directly visible @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , we assume that the source has a single disk that is partially covered by the corona .",
    "this form of model , to be called model 3 hereafter , was employed by gladstone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in their study of ulxs , and is frequently used in bhb studies to represent the thc process of the seed photons from a disk ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "the model determines the coronal temperature @xmath65 and the photon index @xmath66 from the cutoff and the slope of the spectrum , respectively .",
    "the model has successfully reproduced the two spectra , with a similar fit goodness to that with model 2 .",
    "the derived parameters are again listed in table [ tb : avefitp ] , where we converted , after sunyaev and titarchuk  ( 1980 ) , the obtained @xmath65 and @xmath66 into the coronal optical thickness @xmath67 as , @xmath68}\\right\\}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}-\\frac{3}{2 } \\ .",

    "in the two suzaku observations , hol ix x-1 exhibited the pl - like state spectrum which extended up to 11 kev .",
    "these spectra were decomposed into a hard ( @xmath72 ) pl continuum with a roll over at @xmath0 kev , and a weak soft excess in @xmath73 kev . to quantify the @xmath1 kev spectra",
    ", we utilized the mcd+thc modeling , which actually gave acceptable fits to both spectra .",
    "since the peak of the soft excess was at @xmath74 kev , we obtained a relatively low @xmath22 ( @xmath75 kev ) compared to those obtained in the disk - like state of this source ( @xmath76 ; la parola et al .",
    "considering further that the pl continuum is a consequence of the thc process , hol ix x-1 is inferred to harbor a cool ( @xmath77 kev ) and optically thick ( @xmath78 ) corona .",
    "gladstone et al .  ( 2009 ) applied the mcd+thc model to several ulxs to characterize their spectra which are generally concave at @xmath79 kev and convex at @xmath80 kev .",
    "their ulx spectra , all with high - energy roll over corresponding to rather low temperatures ( @xmath81 kev ) , were successfully explained in terms of thc in thick and cool  coronae .",
    "hol ix x-1 is not an exception , and the present result is generally consistent with those in gladstone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "some authors ( e.g. vierdayanti et al .",
    "2010 , gladstone et al .",
    "2009 ) suggested that these cool and thick coronae provide evidence that ulxs are accreting matters at extremely high accretion rates , because similar features are seen in several theoretical studies of super - critical accretion flows ( kawashima et al .",
    "2012 , ohsuga , mineshige & watarai  2007 ) .",
    "however , this type of thick and cool  coronae are being discovered in various accreting objects that are shining considerably below their eddington limits .",
    "for example , noda et al .  (",
    "2011 ) concluded that the soft excess  in active galactic nuclei can be interpreted , at least in some cases , as the highest end of the thc continuum ; a representative type i seyfert , mrk 509 , had a corona with a temperature of @xmath82 kev and an optical depth of 17.6 .",
    "another example is a report by sugizaki et al .",
    "( 2013 ) that the neutron - star binary maxi j0556 - 332 harbored a corona of @xmath83 and @xmath84 kev , during its high / soft ( but still sub - eddington ) state .",
    "thus , these cool and thick coronae can not be regarded as a unique signature of super - critical accretion flows .      from april to october , the x - ray spectrum of hol ix x-1 became softer and @xmath85 more luminous .",
    "the spectral fit showed that , in october , the contribution of the seen - through disk component decreased and the photon index @xmath66 increased , while the coronal temperature @xmath65 and the absorption column density @xmath86 remained unchanged within errors .",
    "since @xmath65 remained constant , the change in @xmath66 must be caused by a slight decrease in the optical depth @xmath67 of the compton cloud ( equation [ eq : tau ] ) .    in order to interpret the observed spectral variability ,",
    "we follow a picture established by makishima et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , which has been motivated to explain spectral variations of the bhb cygnus x-1 in the low / hard state .",
    "specifically , we consider a clumpy and variable corona covering an accretion disk beneath it .",
    "the corona is considered to have some sort of holes  through which the disk component is directly observable as the soft excess .",
    "the rest of the disk emission is comptonized into the hard continuum .",
    "in addition , we assume that the disk is stable , while the opening fraction of the corona varies .    employing the above scenario ,",
    "let us interpret the observed spectral changes .",
    "compared to the april data , the october spectrum has a smaller contribution from the seen - through disk .",
    "this can be explained as a result of a decrease in the opening fraction of the corona .",
    "specifically , the april data indicates an opening fraction of @xmath87 , while that of october @xmath88 , with a relative increase by @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the corona became less clumpy and more uniform in october , so that a larger number of seed photons became comptonized .",
    "furthermore , the less clumpy corona is expected to have a lower local density , leading to a reduced optical depth .",
    "this can explain the steeper pl slope ( the larger @xmath66 ) in october .",
    "thus , the change in clumpiness of the corona can explain the observed spectral variation of hol ix x-1 .",
    "of course , the present object is known to exhibit a wider variety of spectral shapes ( luangtip et al .",
    "2016 ) than we observed .",
    "this suggests that @xmath65 and the average coronal density are also varying sometimes , independently of the opening fraction .",
    "accreting systems frequently exhibit emission and/or absorption lines in their spectra , as well as strong and variable low - energy absorption .",
    "these features are considered to arise via x - ray reprocessing process ( e.g. photoelectric absorption , fluorescence , and resonance scattering ) , by surrounding materials including accretion disks , stellar winds from the mass - donating stars , and the donor s photosphere . however , as reviewed in section 1 , the ulx spectra tend to be extremely featureless , and weakly absorbed .",
    "for example , as mentioned in section 2 , walton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) derived a stringent upper limit on the emission / absorption lines in the present data sets .",
    "luangtip et al .  (",
    "2016 ) studied the long term spectral variability of hol ix x-1 by accumulating data taken with xmm - newton and swift . while hol ix x-1 changed both in its spectral shape and the luminosity ( @xmath90 erg s@xmath5 ) , its absorbing column density remained constant within errors at @xmath91 @xmath10 which is consistent with our measurements . since the galactic absorption column density toward hol ix x-1 is @xmath92 @xmath10 ( dickey & lockman  1990 ) , the intrinsic absorption of hol ix x-1 , including contribution from the host galaxy , is of the order of @xmath93 @xmath10 .",
    "this @xmath86 is much lower and less variable than those in galactic as well as magellanic high mass x - ray binaries , which vary around @xmath94 @xmath10 , often depending on the luminosity ( e.g. novara et al .",
    "these properties of low and stable @xmath86 are considered to apply not only to hol ix x-1 but also to other ulxs , discriminating them from the known high mass x - ray binaries .    according to some computational studies ,",
    "massive outflows are launched , due to high radiative pressure , from bhs that are accreting above their eddington limits ( e.g. kawashima et al .",
    "such outflows , in turn , are expected to produce strong reprocessing features , including low - energy absorption , fluorescence emission lines , absorption edges ( of fe in particular ) , and resonant absorption lines .",
    "in fact , the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h 0707 - 495 , which is considered to be accreting at a super - eddington rate , exhibits deep fe - k absorption features in the spectrum ( hagino et al .",
    "2016 ) , which are blue shifted with a velocity of @xmath2 times the light velocity . if ulxs were accreting also at very high rates , similar features that are much stronger than were barely detected ( ngc 5408 x-1 and ngc 1313 x-1 ; pinto et al .",
    "2016 ) would be ubiquitously detected in their spectra .",
    "therefore , the featureless nature of ulx spectra may not be easily reconciled with the popular view of super - critical accretion .",
    "one possibility is that such outflows from ulxs are highly ionized under strong x - ray illumination .",
    "then , the features such as photoelectric absorption and fluorescence lines will go away .",
    "furthermore , the outflowing plasma can be optically thick to compton scattering , to make the spectrum even more featureless .",
    "however , outflows in super - critical objects are expected , in reality , to be @xmath95 than in sub - eddington sources , for the following reasons .",
    "generally , the ionization degree of outflows must be determined mainly by the ratio of the ionizing luminosity @xmath96 to the outflow density @xmath97 .",
    "as the mass accretion rate @xmath98 gets higher , the @xmath99 ratio would decrease because the accretion flow should become more radiatively inefficient , whereas the @xmath100 ratio would increase because a higher fraction of @xmath98 should turn into outflows .",
    "these effects must lead to a lower @xmath101 ratio , and hence to lower ionization .",
    "when such compton - thick outflows no longer reaches complete ionization , we expect to see fe - k absorption edges at @xmath0 kev , because the cross section for photoelectric absorption by fe ions in solar abundance materials is a few times higher , at 7 kev , than the thomson cross section : the plasma between us and the compton photosphere would inevitably produce the fe - k edge .",
    "indeed , a clear fe - k edge structure is seen in the rxte / pca spectrum of the bhb gro j1655@xmath10240 ( shidatsu et al .",
    "2015 ) , acquired when the object was very luminous and presumably launching an ionized compton - thick wind .",
    "since we do not observe such fe - k edge features from ulxs , the super - eddington scenario appears unfavored even considering the photoionization .      in the super - critical accretion scenario",
    ", it has been frequently argued that the soft excesses  in the ulx spectra originates from photospheres of the optically - thick outflows and the mcd model is just approximating their spectra ( e.g. middleton et al .  2015 ) .",
    "however , in plausible parameter ranges concerned here , the outflows could be optically - thick only to compton scattering , and not to free - free absorption .",
    "then it is not obvious whether a blackbody - like spectrum can be indeed emitted from such outflows .",
    "furthermore , as we showed in @xmath1034.3 and @xmath1034.4 , the spectrum of hol ix x-1 is actually explicable with the ordinary disk emission model , and the featureless spectrum argues against the super - critical accretion scenario .",
    "these facts lead us to estimate the mass of the bh in hol ix x-1 in a rather classical  way , relying on the physics of standard accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev  1973 ) .",
    "since the inner - radius temperature @xmath22 and the disk luminosity @xmath104 are available from the observation , the stefan - boltzmann s law , @xmath105 allows us to calculate the inner - disk radius @xmath106 . for a non - rotating bh , the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco )",
    "is equivalent to 3 times the schwarzschild radius @xmath107 .",
    "then , we are able to estimate the bh mass by identifying @xmath106 with isco ( makishima et al .  1986 ) .",
    "however our spectral model ( model 3 ) implies that only a small fraction of @xmath104 is visible as the soft mcd component , while the rest is comptonized into the hard continuum . to estimate @xmath106 , we hence need to add , in quadrature , @xmath62 ( derived from the mcd component ) and that from the region covered by the corona , @xmath108 , as @xmath109 ( e.g. kubota  2001 , kubota & makishima  2004 , makishima et al .",
    "2008 ) . here",
    ", we assume that the number of photons are conserved in compton scattering .",
    "we must note that the strong comptonization seen in hol ix x-1 would affect the calculation in equation [ eq : rin ] , by distorting the spectrum of the accretion disk beneath it .",
    "assuming that the observed inner - radius temperature and luminosity are modified by factors of @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( both @xmath112 ) , respectively , the true inner - disk radius would be obtained by correcting the apparent inner - disk radius @xmath106 by a factor of @xmath113 . since the comptonization increases both the luminosity ( @xmath114 ) and the temperature ( @xmath115 ) by spectral hardening , it is not obvious whether the correction factor @xmath113 becomes larger or smaller than unity . in order to evaluate",
    "which effect ( @xmath110 or @xmath111 ) will dominate the other , we need to employ more detailed physical models ( e.g. , @xmath116 ; kubota & done  2016 ) , which is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "the values @xmath106 and @xmath104 derived assuming @xmath117 are shown in table [ tb : simfitp ] . since the inclination angle for this system is yet to be known , we assumed a face - on geometry in the calculation . under conditions of non - rotating bh and @xmath118isco ,",
    "the mass of bh in hol ix x-1 is estimated to be @xmath119 , which is in the intermediate - mass regime . however , in some spectral states of bhbs , this @xmath118isco assumption does not always hold : good examples are the states called the very high state ( vhs ) and the low hard state ( lhs ) , which are both characterized by strong comptonization like the present spectra . according to tamura et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the representative bhb , gx 339 - 4 , showed series of vhs spectra which can be explained with an accretion disk of which the innermost radius is truncated at @xmath120 times isco .",
    "yamada et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also found that cygnus x-1 showed a disk truncation at similar radii ( @xmath121 times isco ) in the lhs .",
    "since the typical disk truncation radius in bhbs is thus @xmath122 times isco , we may be allowed to assume that the accretion disk in hol ix x-1 is also truncated at similar radii . under this assumption ,",
    "the bh in this ulx is estimated to have a mass of @xmath123 and shining at @xmath124 ; it still supports the intermediate mass bh scenario . if instead the bh in hol ix x-1 is rapidly spinning , say , with the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath125 , and the disk extends down to isco , we obtain a bh mass of @xmath126 , because in this case the isco will be at @xmath127 .    in kobayashi ,",
    "nakazawa , and makishima  ( 2016 ) , we performed an independent mass estimation focusing on the transition luminosity between the pl state and the disk - like state . by analyzing the spectra of several ulxs including hol ix x-1 , the transition luminosity was found to scatter over an order of magnitude ( @xmath128 erg s@xmath5 ) among the ulxs studied .",
    "if we can identify the transition luminosity with a particular eddington ratio just like in the hard - soft transition of ordinary bhbs , the mass of the ulxs should also span a similar range .",
    "the estimated transition luminosity of hol ix x-1 is @xmath129 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , hol ix x-1 is estimated to have at least @xmath130 if the ulx in the sample with the lowest transition luminosity ( m33 x-8 ) is assumed to have @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the conclusion of kobayashi , nakazawa , and makishima  ( 2016 ) agrees with the present estimation .    finally , as touched in section 1 , the dramatic detection of the gravitational wave event gw150914 ( abbot et al .",
    "2016 ) has given an irrefutable demonstration that a bh with @xmath132 does exist , and presumably even abundant in the universe .",
    "such bhs will accrete from companions if they form binaries , and even directly from interstellar medium ( mii & totani  2005 ) as they drift into regions of high densities ( nakamura et al .",
    "2016 ) such as star - forming sites .",
    "all these arguments are considered to strengthen the intermediate - mass bh scenario .      now that we regard ulxs are relatively massive bhs under sub- or trans - critical accretion ( not highly super critical ) , it is of essential importance to examine how their pl - like spectral state studied here corresponds to the know spectral states of bhbs , namely , the lhs , the high / soft state ( hss ) , the vhs , and the slim - disk state ( sds ) , which are realized approximately in the increasing order of the mass accretion rate ( kubota & makishima 2004 ) . among them , the hss and sds are readily excluded , because they are characterized by convex thermal disk spectra which are distinct from the compton - dominated signals of hol ix x-1 .",
    "we are thus left with the lhs and the vhs , both dominated by thc continua like in ulxs .    of the lhs and the vhs",
    ", the latter appears much closer to the pl - state of ulxs , for the following reasons .",
    "one is that the lhs and vhs are known to emerge at relatively low ( @xmath133 ) and high ( fraction of @xmath134 ; kubota & makishima  2004 ) luminosities , respectively , making the latter clearly more appropriate as an explanation of ulxs .",
    "the other is the temperature ratio between the corona and the seed - photon source , namely @xmath135 ( figure 4 of zhang et al .",
    "2016 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2016 ) ; this quantity is considered to represent a balance between heating by hot ions and cooling by the seed photons , both working on the coronal electrons . in bhbs in the lhs ,",
    "this parameter becomes large at @xmath136 because the corona is very hot ( @xmath137 several tens kev ) and the truncated disk is rather cool at sub - kev temperatures .",
    "in contrast , the vhs of bhbs is characterized by @xmath138 because @xmath22 is somewhat higher at @xmath139 kev than in the lhs , and the corona becomes ( presumably under stronger photon cooling ) much cooler at a few tens kev ( e.g. , kubota & done 2004 , hori et al .",
    "2014 ) . clearly , the condition in ulxs is closer to those in the vhs rather than in the lhs , because we find @xmath140 from hol ix x-1 , and similar values of @xmath141 from other pl - state ulxs ( kobayashi et al .",
    "interestingly , neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries are also found either at @xmath142 in their hss or @xmath143 in their lhs ( zhang et al .",
    "2016 ) , avoiding the region of @xmath144 where ulxs are found in their pl - like state .    in spite of the above similarity between the pl - state of ulxs and the vhs of bhbs",
    ", we certainly notice a few points of differences .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath145 kev derived from hol ix x-1 is considerable lower than those in the vhs , typically @xmath146 kev ( e.g. , kubota & done  2004 , ) .",
    "furthermore , the spectral slope @xmath147 obtained in the present work is flatter ( smaller ) than is found in the vhs of bhbs , typically @xmath148 ( e.g. , kubota & makishima  2004 ) . the latter difference is attributed to generally higher values of the compton @xmath149-parameter , which is @xmath150 in hol ix x-1 , compared to @xmath151 in typical bhbs in the vhs . here .",
    "we define the @xmath149-parameter as @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the mass of an electron and the velocity of light , respectively .",
    "since this @xmath149 represents the thc strength , we may consider , incorporating our discussion in section 4.3 , that the pl - state of ulxs may be reached when the thc in the vhs is more enhanced .",
    "it is however yet to be investigated whether such a difference in the thc strength can be naturally attributed to the implicitly assumed difference in the bh mass .",
    "it is yet to be clarified how the pl - state and mcd - state of ulxs differ and the transition from the former to the latter has any correspondence in bhbs , e.g. , the transition from the vhs to the sds . if theses attempts do not work , we may have to consider , like gladstone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , that ulxs are in an accretion state that differs ( e.g. , in the accretion rate or accretion flow patterns ) from those known in bhbs .",
