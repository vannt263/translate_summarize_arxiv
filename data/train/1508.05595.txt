    "the ubiquity of binary stars is widely known .",
    "more than 60% of main - sequence solar - type stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath23040% of m - type stars have been reported as multiple systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the significant progress of the multiplicity survey of solar - type stars was achieved by @xcite based on the radial velocity measurements . @xcite updated and extended their results using an increased sample with long - baseline interferometry and speckle interferometry .",
    "numerous young binaries have also been detected in nearby star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observational study of young binaries is particularly important for understanding how most stars acquire their planetary systems .",
    "there are notable observations on circumstellar disks in binaries , although their evolutionary process is less clear than in single stars because sufficient data have not been accumulated .",
    "circumprimary and circumsecondary disks around sr  24 in ophiuchus have been directly imaged in the near - infrared with the high spatial resolution , enabling a detailed comparison with theoretical predictions of disk formation and evolution in binary systems @xcite . on the other hand , excess emission in infrared and millimeter regions and line emission as a diagnostic of accretion",
    "have been statistically analyzed to investigate the evolution of circumstellar disks in binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent alma observations yielded several new detections of low - mass circumsecondary disks thanks to the high sensitivity , and the increasing sample size helps to determine the disk population for each binary component @xcite .    in infrared and optical ,",
    "consistent results have emerged from the statistical studies such as on the difference in disk frequency between primary and secondary stars , and the dependence of the disk lifetime on binary separation .",
    "@xcite investigated the nature of circumprimary and circumsecondary disks from their h@xmath11 and @xmath12 colors . because the lifetimes and accretion rates of circumprimary disks exceeded those of the secondary disks",
    ", they concluded that , in general , most of the material in a circumprimary disk is preferentially supplied by the circumbinary disk .",
    "@xcite also studied the @xmath12 , @xmath13 colors , and h@xmath11 for binary systems .",
    "their study showed that @xmath210% of the stars with the gas accretion and the excess in @xmath13 color were photospheric in @xmath12 color , indicating that their disks are in the middle of the inside - out evolution .",
    "these disks are harbored by the secondary stars with primary stars surrounded by disks , while only one of these is harbored by a primary star with a diskless secondary star ; i.e. , circumsecondary disks tend to disperse faster than circumprimary disks . similarly , @xcite used h@xmath11 emission , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 to investigate circumstellar disks in binaries .",
    "they found that there were fewer systems showing the gas accretion only onto the secondary stars than systems only accreting onto the primary stars .",
    "therefore , they deduced that the lifespan of circumprimary disks exceeds that of circumsecondary disks .",
    "past studies have also revealed how the disk existence depends on binary separation ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the lifetime of circumstellar disks in binary systems was significantly shorter at separations of 40  au and below compared to disks of single stars .",
    "they investigated infrared excess from binaries in four nearby star - forming regions ( @xmath213  myr ) using the @xmath14-[8.0]$ ] color obtained with _ spitzer_/irac without resolving the individual stellar components .",
    "accelerated dispersal of circumstellar disks in close binary systems is also suspected among the members of @xmath15  chamaeleon , the ages of which are @xmath168  myr @xcite .",
    "similar results have been recently reported by @xcite , who studied excess emission in taurus binaries over a wide range of wavelengths , from near - infrared to millimeter . from these data",
    ", they calculated the disk frequency , also without resolving individual stellar components .",
    "while @xmath267% of the close binaries ( @xmath1740  au ) disperse their disks within @xmath21  myr , @xmath28090% of single stars and wide binary systems ( @xmath18400  au ) retain their disks during @xmath212  myr .",
    "some properties of the circumstellar disks , such as the disk frequency ( e.g. , @xcite ) , gas accretion , and dust emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , have been reported to be indistinguishable between wide binaries and single stars .",
    "while many studies indicate rapid disk dispersal in close binary systems , the dependence of the disk dissipation time scale on wide binary separation ( @xmath18100  au ) has been little investigated .",
    "especially , sample size was insufficient , and binary components were not spatially resolved at mid - infrared wavelengths where the presence of disks can be more reliably estimated than in near - infrared .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss infrared emission from _ each _ stellar component of binary systems .",
    "the analysis is based on spatially resolved photometry at four wavelengths , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath0 m , obtained from _",
    "spitzer_/irac images .",
    "the irac wavelengths correspond to a dust temperature of @xmath2360800  k and a radial region within a few au for m - type stars .",
    "thus , these wavelengths can probe the inner planet - forming radii in dusty disks .",
    "in addition , _",
    "spitzer_/irac bands located between @xmath19 and @xmath20 that are difficult to access with ground - based telescopes ; therefore , new information such as the onset of infrared excess emission can be obtained .",
    "moreover , the unprecedented sensitivity of _ spitzer _ enables the detection of lower - mass secondaries .",
    "we collected binary systems with the projected separation @xmath21 of @xmath22@xmath23 , corresponding to @xmath22802400  au at 140  pc .",
    "because the images of the primary and secondary stars overlap at projected separations near 2@xmath1 , we analyzed each star by stellar profile fitting for the photometry .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sample ] describes our sample and the _ spitzer_/irac data .",
    "section  [ sec : photometry ] explains the profile fitting photometry .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the measured frequency of excess emission in binary systems and the difference between binary systems and single stars .",
    "the results are discussed in sections  [ sec : binarity ] and summarized in [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of a point source is 2@xmath1 at 8.0  @xmath0 m for _",
    "@xcite . given the array pixel scale of @xmath24 , we selected binary systems with projected separations greater than @xmath22 .",
    "thirty - three binaries of separation of @xmath25@xmath23 in the star - forming regions of taurus ( distance 140  pc ; @xcite , age 12  myr ; @xcite ) and ophiuchus ( distance 140  pc ; @xcite , age 1  myr ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) were extracted from the literature @xcite ( see also table  1 for references on each object ) .",
    "the companionship and membership in taurus or ophiuchus in our sample were examined using the literature because the sample may include suspicious secondary stars not physically associated to the primary , or older systems than 12  myr . in taurus ,",
    "coevality ( @xmath26 ) between primary and secondary stars has been indicated to be @xmath270.4  dex which is significantly smaller than 0.58  dex estimated from the random paring of single stars @xcite . in our initial 33 binaries , the systems whose",
    "ages are known and coevality is larger than 0.4  dex are 2mass  j04554757 + 3028077 , hp  tau / g2 , and dk  tau .",
    "the age difference of @xmath28 was found for dk  tau between the primary and the secondary stars , but a possible systematic error was implied in this age estimation @xcite . in addition , in order to explain the estimated size for the circumprimary disk , the presence of a companion is favored just by the distance of the secondary candidate .",
    "therefore , we retained dk  tau in our binary sample while excluded 2mass  j04554757 + 3028077 and hp  tau / g2 .",
    "in addition , rxj  0437.4 + 1851 , ntts  040142 + 2150 , and v1117  tau systems are speculated to be older compared to the typical ages of taurus based on the li test , or to be unassociated to the taurus region judging from the proper motions ( @xcite ) .",
    "since contamination of these sources can affect the discussion of disk frequency at the age of 12  myr , we eliminated these sources from our sample . for ophiuchus , vssg 23 was removed from our sample due to their non - coevality ( @xmath29 ; @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , sufficient data on coevality and proper motions were not available for many of the ophiuchus sources , and these systems remain to be included in the sample as binary candidates . as a result",
    ", six systems were eliminated from the initial 33 binaries , and 27 systems were analyzed in this paper .",
    "it should be noted that our sample includes triple and quadruple systems consisting of the close binaries with separations of @xmath2@xmath30@xmath31 and the other widely separated components : 2e  1628.2 - 2423 @xcite , v1001  tau @xcite , rxj  0435.9 + 2352 @xcite , l1689  sno2 @xcite , and 2mass  j04251767 + 2617504 @xcite . because the close components should exhibit rapid disk clearing ( @xcite ) , whether this parameter affects our discussion or not is explored in later sections .",
    "binarity in these systems , especially those that are widely separated , has yet to be confirmed by multi - epoch astrometry ; therefore , many of these systems are candidates of binaries .",
    "table  1 summarizes the projected separations and spectral - types taken from literature for our sampled systems .",
    "since the closely spaced systems can not be analyzed by aperture photometry , they were divided into individual components by profile fitting to the _ spitzer_/irac archival images , as described in the following section .",
    "fortunately , many of the binaries are located in regions surveyed in the `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ) legacy project @xcite .",
    "the irac data were acquired from the nasa / ipac infrared science archives . following basic calibration ,",
    "cosmic rays were removed by mosaicking the post - bcd data ( irac instrument handbook ) , and photometry was performed on the mosaicked post - bcd images .",
    "the pixel scale of the post - bcd images was @xmath32 , two times as small as the native pixel size .",
    "the data were obtained over two effective integration times : ` long ` ( 10.4  sec ) and ` short ` ( 0.4  sec ) .",
    "photometry was generally carried out using the ` short`-exposure frames , because these frames yield better fits to the stellar profile .",
    "the exceptions were the faint ( @xmath179 mag ) binaries for which the ` long`-exposure images were used .",
    "the images of the primary and secondary stars overlapped at binary projected separations of @xmath22@xmath14@xmath1 . therefore , we resolved the primary and secondary stars by @xmath33 fitting using a stellar profile model , which determined six variables : the positions of the primary and secondary star ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 for each star ) and the scaling factors of the profile models .",
    "the six simultaneous equations were solved by the newton  raphson method .",
    "the initial position of the primary star was set at the location of the brightest pixel and was adjusted to minimize @xmath33 .",
    "the location of the secondary star was assumed to match its relative position to the primary star , reported in the literature .",
    "the location of the secondary star was then adjusted to minimize @xmath33 .",
    "the initial scaling factor for the profile model was determined to match the pixel intensity to its observed intensity at the initial stellar position . to create the profile model ,",
    "the images of five single stars near the binary system were averaged using the ` psf ` task in iraf .",
    "the uncertainty on the observed psf used for the @xmath33 fitting was estimated as follows .",
    "first , each of the five single stars was fitted with the same fitting tool and profile model , using the standard deviation @xmath36 stored in the 2d uncertainty image in the post - bcd dataset ( ` * _ unc.fits ` ) as a weight . here",
    ", @xmath36 contained dark noise , flat - fielding error , read - out noise , and poisson noise .",
    "at each pixel , the difference between the observed value and the fitted model profile reached @xmath21020% , exceeding those predicted from the uncertainty image by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , to further consider the possible uncertainty associated with the observed psf , the mean of the residuals between the observed profile and the model was calculated from each of the five stars , then applied to the @xmath37 fitting as a new @xmath36 .",
    "averaged stellar profile model , together with its @xmath36 , yielded plausible results ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we also confirmed the quality of the fitting in the residual image and that the location of each star was consistent in the different wavebands , even for closely spaced systems ( @xmath2@xmath39@xmath40 ) .",
    "the @xmath33 of all targets are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the widely separated systems ( @xmath184@xmath1 ) were fitted with the same tool to prevent any systematic error introduced by the fitting tool .",
    "the averaged stellar profile could not be obtained for one system ( tyc  1289 - 513 - 1 ) , because no nearby single stars were found in the same field .",
    "this system was fitted by the template point response function ( prf ) provided by the irac team .",
    "since the fwhm of the template function was always smaller than that of the observed psf , it was convoluted with a gaussian function .",
    "the values store in the post - bcd uncertainty image was used as @xmath36 for the @xmath33 fitting .",
    "the resulting @xmath41 were unacceptably large , which should be plausible because the uncertainty associated with the observed psf was ignored .",
    "we verified the effect of variation in the stellar profile on the photometric results using systems that permitted an averaged stellar profile .",
    "the magnitudes measured between the gaussian - convolved template and averaged stellar profile fitted to the data differed by @xmath170.1  mag in all the irac wavebands . therefore , we concluded that the @xmath36 in the uncertainty files were excessively small and responsible for the huge @xmath33 , but the gaussian - convolved template was reasonably fitted to the data .",
    "the photometric error can be estimated using the revised @xmath36 obtained from the empirical psf constructed from the stellar profiles of five nearby single stars .",
    "the best - fitting scaling factor of the profile was varied until the reduced-@xmath33 changed by 1.17 ( @xmath42 ) , and the flux difference created by this process was considered to be an error in the measured magnitude",
    ". the uncertainty estimates of several binaries were consistent within 10% in all four wavebands . comparing the measured magnitudes with those obtained by gaussian - convolved template fitting , we estimated a conservative photometric error of 0.14  mag in all the irac bands .",
    "photometry in some irac bands was precluded in three systems , because the primary and secondary stars were obscured by a large brightness contrast ( at 3.6  @xmath0 m for doar  24e and at 8.0 and 5.8  @xmath0 m for hn  tau  b ) and by the overlap between the secondary position and the latent image caused by an exceptionally bright primary star ( at 8.0  @xmath0 m for 2e  1628.2 - 2423 ) .",

    "the significant excess starting from 5.8  @xmath0 m is not inconsistent with these previous studies .    the flux density at 24  @xmath0 m was obtained as 236  mjy for the whole system ( primary plus secondary ) @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes measured at 8.0 and 24.0  @xmath0 m for the system are @xmath159  mag and @xmath160 mag , respectively , then the color of @xmath151-[24]$ ] is @xmath161  mag .",
    "this is significantly larger than an averaged - photospheric color of an m - type star of 0.22  mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "because the emission at 24  @xmath0 m can not be spatially resolved , it is difficult to conclude whether the origin of the emission is circumprimary , circumsecondary , both of them , or circumbinary disks .",
    "however , considering the separation of @xmath142  au , the emission at 24  @xmath0 m is possibly not from the inner edge of a circumbinary disk .",
    "the binary jh  223 belongs to the taurus region .",
    "the primary star of this system shows the significant excess at 4.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "the binary separation is small ( @xmath162 ; @xcite ) , and the spectral types of its primary and secondary are estimated as m2 and m6.5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the excess emission at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath0 m were @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166  mag , respectively , estimated by subtracting the photospheric magnitudes obtained from the sed fitting .",
    "this indicates that the onset of the excess is at around 4.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "the resultant @xmath167 values for the psf fitting photometry were 1.0 , 0.4 , 0.7 and 1.0 at the four wavelengths , respectively , implying that the fitting was reasonably performed .",
    "the h@xmath11 emission have identified this source as a weak - lined t tauri star ( @xcite and references therein ) , suggesting that this source lacks an optically - thick , inner disk with active accretion , but may possess an optically - thick , exterior disk .",
    "the photometry at 24  @xmath0 m was previously obtained as @xmath168  mag for the primary and secondary sources @xcite .",
    "the measured magnitudes at 8.0 @xmath0 m of the system is @xmath169  mag and the @xmath151-[24]$ ] color is calculated to be @xmath170  mag , which is significantly higher than an averaged - photospheric value of an m - type star of 0.22  mag @xcite . as in the case of v710 tau , although it is hard to conclude the origin of the excess emission , the emission at 24  @xmath0 m may not be caused by the circumbinary disk .",
