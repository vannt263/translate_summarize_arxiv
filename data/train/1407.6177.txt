    "due to an ever increased population living along coasts and the environmental problems linked to global warming , the understanding of coastal erosion is an important issue .",
    "here we are concerned by rocky coasts erosion events , that are rapid unexpected collapses of cliff sections .",
    "problems in understanding cliff erosion arise from the variety of physical processes involved : sea waves action , whose force increases during storms ; swelling linked to wind ; weathering related to meteorology , rain or frost ; geological processes determining rock lithology ; mechanical condition of the material , like the applied stress or the fatigue level , which in turn depends on the cliff history , determining cracks and faults .",
    "a precise and complete modeling of all these processes is an impossible task .",
    "an attempt to predict a cliff collapse through a direct inspection of all his physical causes would fail , as if we would like to predict the result of a dice throw from the knowledge of its geometry and the launch speed .",
    "exactly as in the case of a dice , we should rather assume our limited knowledge on the coastal system and treat coast erosion as a random process .    in the following , we ll review the main attempts to describe the erosion process , first in terms of average quantities ( average erosion rate ) , then taking into account the episodic character of the dynamics .",
    "sunamura  @xcite gave an expression for the average erosion rate @xmath0 of a cliff , which reads : @xmath1 , \\label{sunamura}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the water density , @xmath3 the gravity acceleration , @xmath4 the wave height at the cliff base , and @xmath5 is the compressive strength of the cliff - forming materials ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants ) .",
    "such a simple expression , however , should be considered as a crude approximation , ignoring other relevant aspects of the system , as the onshore platform width  @xcite , the incident waves energy flux  @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover , this approach should better apply in fast receding shores ( more than @xmath8 m / year ) , at odds with hard rocky coasts , where the erosion dynamics is more episodic in nature ( average recession rates smaller than 0.1 m / year ) .",
    "however , even in the case of fast erosion , the recession is the result of a number of erosion events , whose size and timing have an unknown , random , nature .",
    "some authors have criticized the very concept of average erosion rate , considering misleading to produce `` a single number to characterize the recession of the coast ''  @xcite , and to disregard the local spatial and temporal variability of the process  @xcite .    in order to describe the random character of erosion ,",
    "stochastic models of recessions have been proposed .",
    "some studies  @xcite consider the recession of a shore as the sum of a smooth average recession rate , plus some random fluctuations .",
    "other studies  @xcite propose to model the shore position with more standard stochastic processes ( wiener process ) .",
    "both approaches assume that the shore position has normal distributed fluctuations , in contrast with the monotonic increase of the cliff position ( recession can not be recovered ) .    to overcome such limitations ,",
    "a different stochastic model has been proposed by hall et al .",
    "there , the cliff recession @xmath9 , during a duration @xmath10 , is expressed as the sum of a random number @xmath11 of contributions : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the random magnitude of the @xmath14th recession event . according to wave basin tests  @xcite ,",
    "the distribution of landslide sizes is taken as log - normal , which avoid artificial negative recessions : @xmath15 , \\label{lognormal}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two parameters determining the average size and fluctuations ( variance ) of the distribution .",
    "the erosion events are considered as independent random variables , which are identically distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ lognormal ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of erosion events in a duration @xmath10 is determined assuming a distribution of time between consecutive events . in other words ,",
    "the recession is a step - wise function of time @xmath10 , increasing at random times @xmath18 in agreement with the episodic nature of the process . :",
    "@xmath19    again , the random variables @xmath20 are independently and identically distributed , according to a different distribution @xmath21 which has to be determined in order to completely define the stochastic model . the choice by hall et al . in  @xcite felt on a gamma distribution @xmath22 where the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath6 , which determine the average and variance of the periods @xmath20 , should be related to the statistics of significant storms ( @xmath23 being the reciprocal of their typical return period and @xmath6 the average number of storms needed to cause a damage to the toe of the cliff sufficient to trigger the failure ) .      the choice of a log - normal distribution of retreat lengths in eq .",
    "( [ lognormal ] ) has been first questioned by dong and guzzetti  @xcite .",
    "they perform the analysis of two data catalogs  @xcite , reporting retreats in several sections of england soft cliff coasts , computed from about two hundreds observations at some specified ( mostly yearly ) periods . using these data , dong and guzzetti propose an inverse power law decay for the frequency of coastal retreats versus their magnitude @xmath24 ( at least for large @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a decay exponent and @xmath27 indicates _",
    "proportional to_.    after the paper by dong and guzzetti , a number of works  @xcite try to confirm the power - law decay of the magnitude - frequency distributions . in these works , a better characterization of the erosion event is attained by the identification of several quantities involved in a single cliff collapse . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] a simple sketch is provided showing an ideal cliff erosion and the definition of two possible measures : the horizontal area of the coastal retreat at the cliff top , denoted by @xmath28 , and the maximum local retreat length , marked with @xmath23 .",
    "note that these quantities are better suited to describe large collapses , rather than small rockfalls  @xcite ( where also power law frequency - volume relations have been found ) .",
    "idealization of an erosion event and definition of the measures of interest in this work : horizontal area at the cliff top , @xmath28 , and maximum local retreat , @xmath23.,height=226 ]    in 2006 , teixeira reported  @xcite the analysis on a data - set of 140 failure events observed along the algarve cliffed coast , between porto de ms beach and olhos de gua beach , during nine years . between july 1995 and june 2004 ,",
    "the average loss of horizontal area was 410 @xmath29/year , the mean annual volume was 9760 @xmath30 , and the average recession rate was 0.9 cm / year .",
    "besides average yearly measures , teixeira analyzes the statistics of several linear quantities measured on each single erosion event : mean and maximal length ( of coast interested by the failure ) , mean and maximal width ( of the top cliff area interested by the failure , in the direction normal to the coastline ) , mean and maximal height ( of the failure ) .",
    "the maximal width measured by teixeira corresponds to what is noted here by @xmath23 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) . from these quantities , teixeira computes estimations for",
    "the horizontal area of loss ( as the product between mean width and mean length ) . interestingly",
    ", a strong correlation between the collected measures is observed , which seems compatible with a power law fit .",
    "for instance he reports a power law correlation between the horizontal area and the maximal width ( maximum local retreat ) , with an exponent close to @xmath31 : @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the cumulative frequency size statistics of the erosion events are performed , paying attention to the completeness of the inventory and comparing the results with an older inventory ( from aerial photos ) by marques  @xcite . despite the small number of events available ( only the larger 69 single events )",
    ", teixeira manages to obtain an inverse power law fit with an exponent about @xmath33 for the cumulative distribution of @xmath23 .",
    "we recall that the probability density @xmath34 is equal to ( minus ) the derivative of cumulative distribution @xmath35 .",
    "then , a power law decay of the cumulative with an exponent @xmath36 corresponds to a power law decay of the probability density with an exponent @xmath37 . here , the frequency decay for large failures should be : @xmath38 .",
    "two years later , marques  @xcite pushes the analysis further , considering twelve data - sets , including the one studied by teixeira , but also the statistics of erosion events from other sections of the south - west coast of portugal , as well as a small portion of morocco coast ( see  @xcite for the exact location of the cliffs ) .",
    "the inventories , containing from @xmath39 to @xmath40 data points each , for a total of of @xmath41 cliff failures , are relative to different coast sections , time period and collection methods ( aerial photos , field photos and field survey ) .",
    "the author analyzes the statistics of horizontal area ( @xmath28 ) , maximum local retreat ( @xmath23 ) and volume of the mass movements , by means of frequency - size distributions .",
    "the histograms of each data - set has been normalized to the respective total number of events , with the aim to proceed to a single fit over all the available data .",
    "the resulting distributions are studied in terms of log - binned histograms , which appear to spread over several decades .",
    "again , both for the horizontal area and for the maximum local retreat , negative power laws are observed for large sizes : @xmath42 and @xmath43 . note that the exponent assessed by marques for the maximum local retreat agrees with the findings by teixeira .",
    "alternatively , marques proceeds to a different fitting protocol : he just plots all the histograms together , without normalization , and then he looks for a single power law distribution describing all the available data ( obtaining slightly different exponents , respectively @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .    marques also investigates the correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath23 .",
    "interestingly his analysis , which does not involve binning , nor normalization issues , considers the scatter plot of all the failures showing their area @xmath28 versus the corresponding maximum local retreat @xmath23 .",
    "the graph revealed a quite impressive correlation : all the points seem to align along a single power law curve : @xmath46 .",
    "the exponent found by marques is in striking agreement with the previous result by teixeira , on a more limited data - set .    in a recent paper by young et al .",
    "@xcite , an analysis of a small portion of unprotected and slowly retreating coastal cliffs near point loma in san diego , california , us , is reported .",
    "the authors collected cliff failures observed over @xmath47 years ( about @xmath48 events ) .",
    "they report several cumulative distributions of landslide failure parameters ( area , mean retreat , maximum retreat , and length ) .",
    "since the authors provide their data in a table , we could perform a direct analysis of them . in general the data",
    "does not span a large range of values and the log - binned histograms show a bending at low values , similar to the roll - over observed in landslide distributions  @xcite ( especially for the maximum local retreat @xmath23 ) . performing a fit on the whole interval",
    "gives exponents quite different from a fit on the largest values ( respectively @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , which in turn are consistent with the fits performed by young et al .",
    "@xcite on cumulatives for the same ranges .",
    "interestingly , when one considers the scatter plot @xmath28 vs. @xmath23 , the small values bending seems disappear : a fit on the whole range gives an exponent very close to what observed by teixeira and marques : @xmath51 .",
    "a summary of all these results will be recalled in the discussion section . in particular all the exponents mentioned in the paper",
    "will be given in table  [ total - exponents ] .",
    "in the previous section , we cited different modeling approaches to coastal erosion .",
    "a classification of these models has been proposed in  @xcite . accordingly , the attempt to reproduce a physical , scaled , realization of a coastal system , corresponds to a _",
    "physical model_. on the other hand , _ mathematical models _ try to describe coastal systems in a more theoretical way .",
    "( this class is broad and it could be useful to refine it . )    for instance , the work by dong and guzzetti  @xcite , who proposed the inverse power law distributions in order to characterize the statistics of retreats , can be considered as a mathematical _ statistical modeling_. at first sight this approach can be regarded as purely descriptive .",
    "nevertheless , it turns to be a fundamental step , especially when one is faced with a broadly distributed phenomena , characterized by fat tailed distributions . as we ll explain below , in such cases",
    "the _ statistical model _ warns us that average measures are less meaningful than expected , whereas fluctuations could be the relevant quantities to look at .    before proceeding ,",
    "we wish to stress some general features of fat tailed distributions , in particular power laws .",
    "the very first observation with broadly distributed random variables , is that their fluctuations are much larger than the standard ( gaussian or poissonian ) case .",
    "this does nt only mean that we need larger samples to get clean statistical results , but it can have more severe consequences . to clarify this point , the case of power law distributions is paradigmatic .",
    "consider for instance a random variable @xmath52 , whose density of probability distribution decays , for large @xmath52 , as : @xmath53 obviously , moments of order larger than @xmath54 diverge : @xmath55 this implies that for @xmath56 , the expected average ( @xmath57 ) and variance ( @xmath58 ) are , in some sense , ill defined quantities .",
    "this observation has a direct consequence on the statistical analysis on finite samples . in the standard case ( i.e. for distributions with rapidly , say exponentially , decaying tails ) the empirical average over a sample rapidly converge to the expectation ( i.e. the first moment ) of the distribution ( large numbers theorem )",
    ". one can understand this behavior , since in this case when we add a number @xmath11 of random values , they equally contribute to the sum , giving a mean contribution which grows with @xmath11 and fluctuations around this mean of order @xmath59 . the empirical average , which is the sum divided by @xmath11 , picks exactly the mean value of the sum , killing the contribution of the fluctuations .    for fat tailed distributions the scenario can be completely different .",
    "for instance , for a power law distribution with exponent smaller than @xmath60 , the sum of @xmath11 random values is typically dominated by the few largest values , which overwhelm the rest of the terms .",
    "this is a consequence of slow decaying tails , giving a relatively large probability to large values . in this case",
    ", the empirical average can be highly fluctuating and depends dramatically on the sample size .",
    "more precisely it can be shown  @xcite that the largest on a sequence @xmath61 , @xmath62 , ... ,",
    "@xmath63 of @xmath11 values typically grows as @xmath64 , and consequently the empirical average @xmath65 grows as @xmath66 , which diverges for @xmath67 .",
    "similar arguments show that when @xmath68 , it is the variance that does not exist ( the standard deviation diverges for increasing sample size ) .",
    "the reason why power laws govern many physical phenomena , is a very general issue . to frame the problem",
    ", it is worth recalling that probability distributions can be separated into two distinct categories : stable and non stable distributions .",
    "a probability distribution is stable if the sum of two ( or more ) independent variables thrown from it follows the same probability distribution . roughly speaking ,",
    "there exists only two types of stable laws : the gaussian law and power laws ( levy distributions ) .",
    "for instance , the sum of independent , gaussian random variables follows again a gaussian distribution .",
    "the case of power laws has a more specific interest here , for if the distribution of masses of elementary rock falls obeys a distribution whose tail decays as a power law ( with an exponent between @xmath69 and @xmath60 ) , the distribution of the sum of @xmath11 falls should obeys a power law with the same exponent .",
    "a power law in the distribution of retreats can have serious consequence on the long term erosion rate .",
    "let s reason in terms of the stochastic model presented by hall et al . in  @xcite .",
    "the average retreat rate measured on a time @xmath10 is defined as @xmath70 where @xmath11 is the number of events observed in the time window @xmath10 .",
    "now , if there is a finite mean time @xmath71 between erosion events , as suggested by hall in  @xcite ( where @xmath72 ) , then @xmath73 with @xmath74 . in this case , the average erosion rate , would scale as the average of a sequence of @xmath75 erosion events .",
    "if the distribution of retreat events @xmath76 is a power law ( as suggested by dong and guzzetti  @xcite ) , the measured value of this quantity , as well as their statistical fluctuations , critically depends on the power law exponent . for small values of the exponent ,",
    "the average erosion rate depends on the time window where it is computed , and the very concept of a long term average erosion rate no longer makes mathematical sense ( see fig .  [ fig : powerlaw ] ) .    ) .",
    "upper panel : the retreat ( arbitrary units ) as a function of time ( arbitrary units ) .",
    "note the highly episodic dynamics , which reproduces similar jumps at every scale ( in the inset , a zoom of the first 1000 time steps ) .",
    "lower panel : average erosion rate as a function of elapsed time .",
    "note that the average is ill defined , since it depends of the time windows and does not converge to a constant at large time .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw ] ]    this discussion suggests that the model for @xmath76 is crucial for the interpretation of the phenomenon .",
    "in particular , for very fluctuating phenomena , average quantities could be ill defined . on the other hand",
    ", the study of fluctuations may turn to be quite interesting and models as the one proposed by hall  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) could be very useful tools .",
    "we adopt the name of _ stochastic models _ for similar studies , since these models are standard in stochastic processes theory ( for instance the model by hall is a _ renewal process _  @xcite ) .",
    "_ stochastic models _ make use of _ statistical models _ in order to define a stochastic process describing the fluctuating nature of the observation .",
    "these models , below referred as _",
    "st - models _ , allow to produce a synthetic succession of erosion events through numerical simulation of a stochastic process .",
    "the analysis of such numerical data can be compared with field observations , or adapted to them via bayesian parameter estimation , and hopefully used for expert assessment of local analysis .    however , both _ statistical _ and _ stochastic",
    "_ models still lack of a more grounded , physical justification .",
    "some authors  @xcite noted that `` the physical reason as to why the width frequency of slope mass movements satisfy the power - law is uncertain , since it depends on the complex relation between the internal characteristics of the rock masses and the slope mass movements triggers .",
    "the best single explanation takes into account the relationship stated by malamud et al .",
    "( 2004 )  @xcite between landslide event magnitude and trigger magnitude",
    ". retreat of cliffs or coastal bluffs is greatly dependent on the frequency of wave attack on cliff toe and on the rain intensity , which are triggering factors that obey themselves power laws . ''",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we provide arguments for a different origin of the observed power laws , related to the `` critical '' nature of the erosion process .",
    "another mathematical property of power laws , is that they are homogeneous function , i.e. that they satisfy a multiplicative scaling , i.e. @xmath77 this means that a change of scale of the quantity @xmath52 results in a change of scale in the value of @xmath78 , with an appropriate exponent .",
    "vice versa , it s easy to show , choosing @xmath79 , that eq .",
    "[ homogeneous ] implies that @xmath80 is a power law : @xmath81 .    knowing the scaling behavior of a function is very useful in order to get its expression . in ordinary geometry , we know that if we double the radius of circle , its area will be four times larger , i.e. it will scale by @xmath82 ( the surface is an homogeneous function of the radius , with @xmath83 ) .",
    "this implies that the area is proportional to the square of the radius .",
    "nature produces more complex geometrical objects .",
    "river network basins , for instance , are known to satisfy hack s law  @xcite : if one consider the length @xmath84 of the main stream of a river basin as a function of the basin area @xmath26 , it turns that in average : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is about @xmath87 .",
    "an other geomorphological example is provided by rocky coasts . in several cases",
    "it has been observed  @xcite that coastlines are fractal , a property which can be expressed as a scaling of the length @xmath24 of the coast between two points as a function of the distance between the points @xmath88 @xmath89 the exponent @xmath90 , the coastal fractal dimension , is often around @xmath91 , but it may attain higher values for fjorded coasts  @xcite .    for both cases , river networks and rocky coasts , the appearance of power laws in their geometrical characterizations has a striking visual counterpart .",
    "if we look at the map of a fractal coast , as well as at a picture of a river network , is very difficult to guess its scale , if it is not explicitly mentioned in the map , or if there are no known objects ( houses , trees ) to compare .",
    "this property is generally known as `` scale invariance '' , and indicates the absence of a characteristic length in the system .",
    "even the geometry of coastal erosion events seem to display non trivial scaling properties . as reviewed in the introductory section of this paper",
    ", the available studies  @xcite suggest that the horizontal area of the eroded cliff top area @xmath28 scales in average as a power of the maximum local retreat @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath92 where the exponent @xmath93 is around to @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the average , or typical area @xmath28 , of an erosion of retreat @xmath23 .",
    "the need for using the average @xmath95 is due to the fact that the horizontal area @xmath28 is not a deterministic function of the retreat @xmath23 , and the relation  ( [ scalingavsl ] ) holds `` on average '' . to be more precise",
    ", one should consider that @xmath28 and @xmath23 are random variables defined by their joint probability distribution @xmath96 , which is unknown , and the average @xmath97 is computed using the conditional probability @xmath98 ( i.e @xmath97 is the conditional average @xmath99 $ ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we may have access to the ( marginalized ) distribution @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "observations from catalogs indicate that , in a measurable range of values , both quantities seem to present a power law distribution , which defines two other exponents : @xmath102    as we ll show in the following , if the scenario depicted by eqs .",
    "( [ scalingavsl ] ) ,  ( [ pdl ] ) ,  ( [ pda ] ) is confirmed , then it is possible to propose a simple scaling hypothesis on the conditional probability distribution that gives a relation between the three exponents .",
    "in other words , the three values @xmath93 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 are not independent , and their relation can be useful to check the consistency of the measured exponents .",
    "scaling relations for power law exponents , obtained via scaling hypothesis similar to what will be proposed here , has been the starting point for very fruitful investigations in the statistical physics of critical phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the deep reason for this is that near critical points ( curie temperature for magnetic materials , critical point for vapor - liquid transition , superconductive transition , super - fluid transition , etc ) physical systems display a form of `` scale invariance '' .    in this context",
    "it has been possible to understand the occurrence of power laws , to compute analytically their exponents and to identify class of phenomena which should obey the same laws ( _ universality classes _ ) . in order to achieve this result ,",
    "models have been proposed , which consider only some very basic , minimalist ingredients of the real , complex , physical system .",
    "nevertheless , such models correctly and quantitatively describe specific critical behaviors ( for instance power law exponents ) of a large and diverse class of natural systems .    in this spirit , a _ statistical physical model _",
    "( _ sp - model _ ) for the erosion of rocky coasts has been proposed  @xcite , aimed to describe the observed large scale geometry of rocky coasts , including , but not limited , to fractal coasts  @xcite .",
    "here we show that the same model can give insights on the statistics of erosion events .",
    "the relevance of such approach is to give a rationale for the observation of power laws .",
    "moreover , the model allows to relate the coastal erosion process to the universality class of percolation phenomena , and it opens the possibility of a direct computation of some exponents characterizing the erosion statistics .    in the following ,",
    "we propose a scaling hypothesis which reproduce the general statistical features of present catalogs .",
    "finally , we present extensive numerical simulations of the sp - model  @xcite for rocky coast erosion , which produce , without adjustable parameters , power laws directly comparable with the observed ones .",
    "the correlation observed between @xmath28 and @xmath23 , should reflect a dependence on the probability distributions of @xmath28 and @xmath23 .",
    "as a first crude approximation , one can consider @xmath28 as a deterministic function of the random variable @xmath23 , where @xmath105 in this case , it is straightforward to obtain the distribution @xmath100 from the distribution @xmath101 , since : @xmath106 this implies that if @xmath101 decreases as a power law for large @xmath23 , the same would happens for @xmath100 and corresponding decay exponents would be related by the equation : @xmath107 eq .",
    "( [ strict ] ) is a very strong assumption and , as explained above , it should rather be recast in terms of the ( conditional ) average of @xmath28 , which is a random variable fluctuating around this mean .",
    "nevertheless , it s quite simple to generalize the computation , making use of a simple scaling hypothesis on the conditional probability @xmath98 , which is nothing but @xmath108 : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is an arbitrary probability distribution .",
    "as detailed in the appendix  [ app : scaling ] , the computation leads exactly to the same  eq.([scalinglaw ] ) .",
    "here we present the statistics of erosion events generated by numerical simulations of a particular sp - model , whose detailed definition appeared elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the model is to consider the coast ( and the inland ) as a random medium , i.e. characterized by local random numbers @xmath111 ( where @xmath14 are the geographical coordinates of the site ) which measure the resistance to sea erosion .",
    "when a site is exposed to the action of the sea , its resistance @xmath111 is compared with an average sea erosion force @xmath78 and eroded if @xmath112 .",
    "this extreme simplification of the coastal system is slightly articulated : by one side considering that the resistance @xmath111 takes into account a principle of local mechanical stability ( resistance is smaller if the site is not protected or sustained by neighbors , i.e. it decreases together with the number of neighboring rocky sites ) . on the other hand",
    "the sea force is not constant in time , but responds to the damping effect of the coastal geometry : @xmath78 is smaller for irregular coastlines , i.e. with bays and headlands , than in the case of a straight shoreline .",
    "the numerical implementation of the model  @xcite ( see appendix  [ app : model ] for details ) shows that such simple ingredients put in place a feedback mechanism : eroding the weaker parts of the coasts , the sea may increase the irregularity of the coastline .",
    "a larger irregularity , in turn , increases the damping of the sea force and , hence , slows down sea erosion .",
    "the result of this dynamics ( called `` fast erosion '' in  @xcite ) is the emergence of a stable coastline , whose local resistances are everywhere stronger than the current sea erosion force .",
    "the geometry of this stable coastline has been extensively studied : it depends on the importance of the damping ( determined by the only parameter of the model , called `` gradient '' ) and can be directly related to the geometry of a well known fractal mathematical object , the accessible external perimeter of the critical percolation cluster  @xcite , whose dimension has been demonstrated equal to @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the model is not restricted to fractal coasts , since full fractality develops only in the case of very small gradient .    in the current study",
    ", we consider a stable coast as the starting point for the collection of erosion events .",
    "the coast is supposed to come from previous erosion which means that the coast is constituted by a collection of `` strong '' rocks that all present a resistance to erosion @xmath111 that are , by definition , larger than the sea erosion force @xmath78 .",
    "then we proceed to simulate a `` slow weathering '' process : i.e. we progressively weaken the exposed rocks until a single site becomes fragile ( i.e. its resistance @xmath114 is smaller than @xmath78 ) .",
    "this triggers a new fast erosion dynamics that keeps going until a new stable coast is found .",
    "when the coast is again stable against erosion , we identify the connected sets of sites  @xcite just eroded and we compute for each their surfaces @xmath28 and their maximum local depth @xmath23 .    we perform extensive numerical simulations , for large systems ( @xmath115 larger than @xmath116 ) collecting a large number of erosion events ( larger than @xmath117 ) , for several values of the gradient parameter @xmath3 ( see appendix  [ app : model ] for details ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : area - several - g ] , we show some statistics obtained for the area @xmath28 . we observe that the power law decay is _ mostly independent _ from the value of the gradient , which rather controls the range where the power law decay applies . as expected from previous studies  @xcite , the smallest the gradient , the larger the range where scale invariance ( hence power law decay ) applies .",
    "the gradient parameter @xmath3 controls the largest characteristic scale in the system , i.e. the geometrical correlation length of the coastline .",
    "this length , in turns , corresponds to the largest erosion size typically observed . in other words , @xmath3 controls the cut - off at large size of the power law decay of both @xmath28 and @xmath23 : the smallest @xmath3 , the broader the power law range in the distributions .",
    "in particular , simulation of the smallest @xmath3 value , produced more than @xmath117 erosion events and a very clear power law decay , without any observable cut - off at large sizes .",
    "thanks to the extensive statistics , we obtained a good estimation of the decay exponents , quite insensible to binning or to the range of fitting ( even if for small sizes , some spurious effects due to the lattice geometry are observed ) .",

    "for instance it could be useful to generate synthetic statistics of erosion events , in terms of their horizontal area and the maximum local retreat .",
    "obviously these two quantities are statistically dependent and one should not simply use the observed single variable distributions @xmath100 and @xmath101 , but take in consideration the full joint probability distribution @xmath132 . this can be done , through the conditional probability , since @xmath133 making the scaling assumption on the @xmath98 in eq .",

    "in this work we have discussed various aspects of the statistics of rocky coast erosion . as many geological processes , coast erosion acts on many time scales and on broad length scales .",
    "several works have convincingly raised the hypothesis of power laws in the distribution of cliff failure sizes .",
    "we tried to put together different observations in a tentative coherent framework .",
    "in particular , we note an interesting convergence by different researchers on a geometrical characterization of erosion events , which relates the horizontal area lost at the cliff top with the maximum local retreat .",

    "more difficult is the measure of the decay exponents @xmath103 and @xmath104 of distributions , respectively , for the area and for the maximum retreat .",
    "however , it is quite easy to obtain a relation between the three exponents , based on simple scale invariance hypothesis . in other words ,",

    "we judge the result quite fair , considering the scarce statistics from which the exponents are measured ( see the last row of table  [ total - exponents ] ) .    in a totally different step ,",
    "we develop what could be called a toy model of sea erosion , in which the resistance to erosion of the rocks are distributed randomly but the rocks are submitted to a sea erosive power that decreases due to energy damping along a more irregular coast .",
    "the spontaneous evolution of such a system leads to an irregular and stable coastline , which , under the action of slow weathering or storms , undergoes to an episodic sequence of erosion events .",
    "the important point here is that , taking an earth constituted by random rocks , the sea erodes the weaker rocks , up to reaching a set of strong rocks .",

    "we collect large sequences of erosion events .",
    "we study their geometry and compute their statistics , to be compared with real data from existing catalogs .",

    "such a result , however , was highly expected , since our model possesses some scale invariant features , typical of critical phenomena , which justify the scaling hypothesis on its probability distributions .",

    "note two important aspects of our results .",
    "firstly , many details of the numerical implementation of the model are known to be irrelevant , with respect to the measured exponents ( geometry of the lattice , distribution of lithology , several dynamical rules etc . ) .",
    "this property descends from the fact that our model of rocky coast erosion belongs to the _ percolation universality class _ , identified exactly by the value of the exponents of power law distributed quantities ( critical exponents ) .",
    "secondly , our model does not need a fine tuning of external parameters : the only parameter of the model ( the gradient ) determines the maximum size of observed failures , but does not change the exponents of the produced power law statistics .",
    "this makes our model an example of what is called `` self - organized criticality '' .",
    "we recall that the connection between percolation and coast geometries has been recently invoked by independent studies  @xcite . here",
    ", we show how the coastal erosive dynamics could represent an other , important hook to corroborate such a link .    beyond its conceptual and theoretical value ,",
    "these results open interesting perspectives for future studies .",
    "for example , the scaling relations between several measured exponents , similar to the one proposed here , could be used as a benchmark for the coherence of the statistical description of catalogs , as well as a possible source of prediction for missing or scarce statistics .",
    "this also suggest that further investigations on the geometrical characterization of erosion events , could be useful to relate different quantities and their probability distributions .",
