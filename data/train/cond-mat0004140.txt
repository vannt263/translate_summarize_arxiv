    "novel phenomena in mesoscopic systems have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental interest for many years@xcite . observed effects such as weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations are due to the quantum interference of electrons at low temperatures .",
    "an important branch of mesoscopic physics is that of hybrid nanostructures where the influence of a superconductor ( s ) on a phase coherent normal ( n ) region is studied@xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "the role of andreev reflection@xcite is important , whereby particles in the n region with excitation energies @xmath1 lower than the superconducting gap energy @xmath2 are reflected from the n / s interface as holes .",
    "studies of subgap transport have shown that superconducting condensate penetration into the n region , known as the proximity effect , may substantially change the resistance of an n / s circuit .    lately , improvements in the microprocessing of metals has led to the fabrication of nanostructures combining ferromagnetic ( f ) and s materials@xcite .",
    "the presence of a large exchange field , @xmath3 , suppresses electron - hole correlations in ferromagnets so that the role of the proximity effect is reduced .",
    "however a separate mechanism has been predicted@xcite to produce a resistance increase in a circuit consisting of a mono - domain f wire connected to an s electrode instead of an n electrode .",
    "this is a robust , classical effect which originates from the need to match a spin - polarized current in the ferromagnet to a spinless current in the superconductor .",
    "the present work analyses the weak localization correction to the contact f / s resistance . in a semiclassical language ,",
    "weak localization arises from an enhanced backscattering caused by the quantum interference of pairs of coherent quasi - particles@xcite .",
    "constructive interference of a quasi - particle paired with its time reversed partner is destroyed by a magnetic field so we assume that the width of the f wire , @xmath4 , is small , @xmath5 nm , in order to limit the influence of the intrinsic magnetic field .",
    "weak localization is affected by the boundary conditions of the system .",
    "particles that escape into an n electrode suffer dephasing which reduces the return probability .",
    "however , multiple andreev reflections from an s electrode may enable a particle to return coherently .",
    "for a polydomain f wire , with no net average polarization , the return probability of an f / s system is greater than that of an f / n system@xcite .",
    "in general , the spin channels have different conductivities , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the density of states and the classical diffusion coefficient for electrons in the spin state @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the degree of spin polarization , @xmath11 , is defined as @xmath12 and we calculate the return probability in an f / s system with an arbitrary degree of polarization , @xmath13 .",
    "in addition we introduce a finite spin relaxation length , @xmath14 , shorter than the length , @xmath15 , of the f wire , @xmath16 . as the spin polarization increases , the majority spin channel experiences a further increase in return probability ( as compared to the f / n case ) , whereas the minority spin channel suffers a reduction .",
    "majority carriers at the superconducting interface can not find minority carrier states to andreev reflect into and are more likely to be reflected normally whereas minority carriers at the interface have an enhanced probability to escape .",
    "for @xmath17 the reservoir appears to be totally insulating to majority spins but normal as far as minority spins are concerned .    after calculating the correction to the classical diffusion coefficient that is due to the enhanced return probability , we find the corresponding change in the spin polarized particle distribution and we determine the weak localization correction to the classical resistance .",
    "generally this is a sum of a bulk term that is independent of the state of the reservoir and a contact term , @xmath18 , that depends on whether the reservoir is in the superconducting or the normal state .",
    "we find that @xmath19 , so that a change in the state of the reservoir from n to s results in an increase of the weak localization contribution to the resistance , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the resistance of a cube of length equal to the width of the wire @xmath4 .",
    "the combination @xmath22 corresponds to the resistance of a piece of ferromagnet of length @xmath14 .",
    "we evaluate the prefactor , @xmath23 , numerically and find that it is almost constant , @xmath24 , for all experimentally relevant values of spin polarization .",
    "we begin by briefly describing the approach of refs .   which enables one to calculate the classical contact resistance of an f / s interface and we refer the reader to those papers for further details .",
    "we consider a single domain , disordered ferromagnetic wire of length @xmath15 as depicted in fig .  1 .",

    "this is a robust classical effect which originates from the need to match a spin - polarized current in the ferromagnet to a spinless current in the superconductor .",
    "it is specific to mono - domain wires since in poly - domain wires the tranport properties of spin - up and spin - down particles do not differ and , on the average , the current is not spin - polarized .",
    "the weak localization correction to the classical diffusion coefficient , @xmath50 , is related to a two particle green s function known as the cooperon propagator@xcite .",
    "the cooperon consists of a quasi - particle following a diffusive path that interferes with a quasi - particle traversing the same path in the opposite direction . when the particles follow a closed path , the interference results in an enhanced return probability . in a ferromagnet ,",
    "singlet and @xmath51 triplet cooperons are suppressed since the fermi momentum for spin - up and spin - down particles is different , producing a difference in the phase accumulated by the particles along the path .",
    "however , there is no such suppression of the phase correlation in the triplet channel where same spin particles are paired .",
    "thus we assume that the return probability is given by the triplet cooperon propagator , @xmath52 , for equal spatial coordinates,@xcite @xmath53 which obeys a diffusion equation in the disordered ferromagnet , @xmath54 here the spin relaxation time , @xmath55 , is related to the spin relaxation length in the spin channel @xmath9 , @xmath56 .",
    "we stress that the existence of a cooperon is not a result of the proximity effect as we do not consider triplet pairing induced in the ferromagnet by the presence of the superconductor .",
    "nevertheless , weak localization is affected by the boundary conditions of the system .",
    "a schematic of the change in the boundary conditions of the cooperon at the f / s interface as compared to the f / n interface is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "a process which pairs two spin - up quasi - particles is depicted in fig .",
    "when the reservoir is in the n state , particles escaping into it suffer dephasing , thus destroying the cooperon . at the left hand reservoir ( @xmath57 ) ,",
    "which is in the n state , we therefore have @xmath58 when the right hand reservoir ( @xmath59 ) is in the s state we apply @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a phase accumulated on reflection from the superconductor . these boundary conditions ,",
    "similar to those for the density eqs.([bc2],[bc3 ] ) , account for andreev reflection .",
    "multiple andreev reflections at an s electrode may enable a particle to return coherently to the original place in the f wire with the same spin polarization .",
    "2b shows a process whereby a pair of spin - up quasi - particles are andreev reflected as spin - down quasi - holes which are subsequently andreev reflected as spin - up quasi - particles .",
    "the calculation of @xmath50 by solving the cooperon diffusion equation with the above boundary conditions is described in appendix  [ app : a ] .",
    "the weak localization correction to the diffusion coefficient , @xmath50 , leads to a correction to the current density , @xmath62 .",
    "however , @xmath50 also produces a correction to the particle distribution function .",
    "we take this into account perturbatively by assuming that the correction , @xmath50 , to the classical diffusion coefficient , @xmath63 , is small and that there is a corresponding small correction , @xmath64 , to the classical particle distribution , @xmath65 .",
