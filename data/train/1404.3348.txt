    "* framework . * in a general physical theory , a measurement is described by a collection of events , each event labelled by an outcome .",
    "we first consider demolition measurements , which adsorb the measured system . in this case , the measurement events are called _ effects _ and the measurement is a collection of effects @xmath0 . for a system prepared in the state @xmath1 , the probability of the outcome @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 . in quantum theory this is a notation for the born rule @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath1 is a density matrix and @xmath5 is a measurement operator . in general theories",
    ", @xmath6 does not denote a trace of matrices and in fact the actual recipe for computing the probability @xmath6 is irrelevant here .",
    "we will often use the notation @xmath7 and @xmath8 for effects and states , respectively .",
    "it is understood that two different states give different probabilities for at least one effect , and two different effects take place with different probabilities on at least one state .",
    "when two measurements @xmath9 and @xmath10 are performed in parallel on two systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we denote by @xmath13 the measurement event labelled by the pair of outcomes @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , when two states of systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 , say @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are prepared independently , we denote by @xmath17 the corresponding state of the composite system @xmath18 . in quantum theory , this is the ordinary tensor product of operators , but this may not be the case in a general theory and , again , the actual recipe for computing @xmath19 is irrelevant here .",
    "what is relevant , instead , is that the notation is consistent with the operational notion of performing independent operations on different systems : if two systems are independently prepared in states @xmath15 and @xmath16 and undergo to independent measurements @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 , we impose that the probability has the product form @xmath20 .",
    "the most basic operation one can perform on a measurement is to join some outcomes together , thus obtaining a new , less informative measurement .",
    "this operation , known as _ coarse - graining _ , is achieved by dividing the outcomes of the original measurement @xmath0 into disjoint groups @xmath21 , and by identifying outcomes that belong to the same group .",
    "the result of this procedure is a new measurement @xmath22 satisfying the relation @xmath23 for every every @xmath24 and for every possible state @xmath1 . for brevity , we write @xmath25 .",
    "coarse - graining allows one to express the principle of _ causality _ , which states that the settings of future measurements do not influence the outcome probabilities of present experiments @xcite .",
    "causality is equivalent to the requirement that for every system @xmath11 there exists an effect @xmath26 , called the _ unit _",
    ", such that @xmath27 for every measurement @xmath0 on @xmath11 . in quantum theory",
    ", @xmath26 is the identity operator on the hilbert space of the system and eq .",
    "( [ causal ] ) expresses the fact that quantum measurements are resolutions of the identity .",
    "when there is no ambiguity , we drop the subscript from @xmath26 .",
    "causality has major consequences .",
    "first of all , it implies that the probability distributions generated by local measurements satisfy the no - signalling principle @xcite .",
    "moreover , it allows to perform adaptive operations : for example , if @xmath28 is a measurement on system @xmath11 and @xmath29 is a measurement on system @xmath12 for every value of @xmath2 , then causality guarantees that it is possible to choose the measurement on @xmath12 depending on the outcome on system @xmath11 , that @xmath30 is a legitimate measurement .",
    "finally , causality allows one to describe non - demolition measurements . for a non - demolition measurement @xmath31 ,",
    "the measurement events are _ transformations _ , which turn the initial state of the system , say @xmath1 , into a new unnormalized state @xmath32 . for a system prepared in the state @xmath1 ,",
    "the probability of the outcome @xmath2 is @xmath33 and , conditionally on outcome @xmath2 , the post - measurement state is @xmath34",
    ". we will often refer to the non - demolition measurements as _ instruments _ , in analogy with the usage in quantum theory @xcite .",
    "note that , thanks to causality , every instrument @xmath35 is associated to a unique demolition measurement @xmath36 via the relation @xmath37 by definition , @xmath36 describes the statistics of the instrument : for every state @xmath1 and for every outcome @xmath2 , one has @xmath38 . in textbook",
    "quantum mechanics , physical quantities are associated to self - adjoint operators , called observables @xcite .",
    "the values of a quantity are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator and the probability that a measurement outputs the value @xmath2 is given by the born rule @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 is the projector on the eigenspace for the eigenvalue @xmath2 and @xmath1 is the density matrix of the system before the measurement . if the measurement gives the outcome @xmath2 , then the state after the measurement is @xmath41 $ ] , according to the projection postulate .",
    "these canonical measurements , where all the measurement operators are orthogonal projectors , are called sharp @xcite . while it is clear that sharp measurements play a key role in quantum theory it is by far less clear how to define them in an arbitrary gpt . here",
    "we propose a simple definition based on the notions of repeatability and minimal disturbance .",
    "let us start from repeatability .",
    "an instrument @xmath42 is _ repeatable _ if it gives the same outcome when performed two consecutive times , namely @xmath43 where @xmath36 is the measurement of eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) .",
    "repeatability poses a fairly weak requirement on @xmath36 : every measurement that discriminates perfectly among a set of states @xmath44 can be realized by a repeatable instrument , which consists in measuring @xmath36 and , if the outcome is @xmath2 , re - preparing the system in state @xmath45 .",
    "the second ingredient entering in our definition of sharp measurements is minimal disturbance .",
    "we say that the instrument @xmath46 does not disturb the measurement @xmath47 if the former does not affect the statistics of the latter , namely @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "then , we ask which instruments disturb the smallest possible set of measurements .",
    "clearly , if @xmath35 does not disturb @xmath50 , then @xmath50 must be compatible with the measurement @xmath51 , in the sense that @xmath52 and @xmath50 can be measured jointly .",
    "indeed , by measuring @xmath50 after @xmath53 one obtains the probability distribution @xmath54 , whose marginals on @xmath2 and @xmath55 are equal to the probability distributions of @xmath52 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "read in the contrapositive , this means that if @xmath52 and @xmath50 are incompatible , the instrument @xmath35 must disturb @xmath50 .",
    "this leads us to the following definition : an instrument @xmath35 has _ minimal disturbance _ if it disturbs only the measurements that are incompatible with @xmath56 .",
    "we define an instrument to be sharp if it is both repeatable and with minimal disturbance .",
    "we say that a measurement is sharp if it describes the statistics of a sharp instrument and we call an effect sharp if it belongs to a sharp measurement . in quantum theory ,",
    "our definition coincides with the usual one : one can prove that the only sharp instruments are the lders instruments @xcite , of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a collection of orthogonal projectors .",
    "hence , the sharp measurements are projective measurements . in addition",
    ", we can prove that when a sharp measurement extracts a coarse - grained information , the experimenter can still retrieve the finer details at a later time .",
    "in fact , this is a necessary and sufficient condition for a measurement to be sharp , as proven in the methods section .",
    "* fundamental sharpness of measurements .",
    "* sharp measurements are an ideal standard",
    " they are the measurements that generate outcomes in a repeatable way , while at the same time causing the least disturbance on future observations .",
    "unfortunately though , most measurements in real life appear to be noisy and not repeatable . hence the natural question : is noise fundamental ? or rather it is contingent to the fact that the experimenter has incomplete control on the conditions of the experiment ? here",
    "we state that noise is not fundamental and only arises from the fact that the realistic measurements do not extract information only from the system , but also from the surrounding environment :    [ ax : sharpness ] every measurement arises from a sharp measurement performed jointly on the system and on the environment .",
    "precisely , we require that for every measurement @xmath59 there exists an environment @xmath60 , a state @xmath61 of @xmath60 , and a sharp measurement @xmath62 on the composite system @xmath63 such that , for every state @xmath1 of system @xmath64 , one has @xmath65 for every outcome @xmath66 . in quantum theory , this is the content of the celebrated naimark s theorem @xcite .",
    "this is a deep property , hinting at the idea there exists a fundamental level where all measurements are ideal .",
    "let us push the idea further .",
    "if measurements are sharp at the fundamental level , it is natural to assume that the set of sharp measurements is closed under the basic operation of coarse - graining , which transforms an initial measurement @xmath52 into a new , less informative measurement @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath67 provides less information than @xmath52 , one expects that @xmath67 should not be less repeatable , nor create more disturbance , than @xmath52 .",
    "this intuition leads to the following requirement :    [ ax : coarse ] if a measurement is less informative than a sharp measurement , then it is sharp .",
    "suppose now that two experimenters , alice and bob , perform two sharp measurements on two systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 in their laboratories .",
    "again , if measurements are sharp at the fundamental level , one expects the result of alice s and bob s measurements to be a sharp measurement on the composite system @xmath68 .",
    "if this were not the case , it would mean that at the fundamental level some measurements require nonlocal interactions , even though at the operational level the they appear to be implemented locally by alice and bob . we then postulate the following    [ ax : loc ] if two sharp measurements are applied in parallel on systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 , then the result is a sharp measurement on the composite system @xmath18 .",
    "principles 1 - 3 lay down the fundamental structure of sharp measurements , summarized in fig . [ fig : sharp ] .",
    "( round diagram on the l.h.s . ) performed on system @xmath64 in state @xmath1 is equivalent to a sharp measurement @xmath69 ( triangular diagram on the r.h.s . )",
    "performed jointly on the system and on an environment @xmath60 in state @xmath61 .",
    "( * b * ) coarse - graining a sharp measurement @xmath70 yields a new sharp measurement @xmath71 .",
    "( * c * ) when two sharp measurements @xmath36 and @xmath72 are performed in parallel , they yield a new sharp measurement @xmath73 . ]",
    "they are satisfied by classical theory and by quantum theory , both on complex and real hilbert spaces . in the following",
    "we will show that the fundamental structure of sharp measurements has an enormous impact on the amount of nonlocality and contextuality that can be found in a physical theory .",
    "* derivation of ce .",
    "* at present , ce is the only principle known to constrain the amount of contextuality of a generic theory .",
    "operationally , the principle can be formulated as follows : consider a collection of sharp measurements @xmath74 , each measurement having outcomes in a set @xmath75 .",
    "suppose that the possible events have been labelled so that two effects corresponding to the same outcome coincide , @xmath76 , independently of @xmath2 .",
    "letting @xmath77 be the set of all outcomes , one calls two distinct outcomes @xmath78 _ exclusive _ if there exists a measurement setting @xmath2 such that both @xmath55 and @xmath79 belong to @xmath80 .",
    "we say that a theory satisfies ce if for every set of mutually exclusive outcomes @xmath81 and for every state @xmath1 the probabilities @xmath82 obey the bound @xmath83 our first key result is the derivation of ce .",
    "in fact , we prove a stronger result : we define two sharp effects @xmath84 and @xmath85 to be _ orthogonal _ if they belong to the same ( not necessarily sharp ) measurement and we prove that mutually orthogonal effects can be combined into a single sharp measurement ( see methods ) .",
    "clearly , since mutually exclusive outcomes correspond to mutually orthogonal effects , the existence of a joint measurement containing the effects @xmath86 implies the bound @xmath87 .",
    "our result implies that in a theory where measurements are fundamentally sharp the violation of kochen - specker inequalities is upper bounded by the value set by ce @xcite .",
    "what is remarkable here is that a single requirement on measurements influences directly the strength of contextuality in an arbitrary physical theory .",
    "this situation contrasts with that of the known axiomatizations of quantum theory @xcite , where the quantum bounds on contextuality are retrieved only indirectly through the derivation of the hilbert space framework .",
    "our principles do not imply only ce , but also the whole hierarchy of extensions of this principle defined in ref .",
    "the @xmath88-th level of the hierarchy can be defined by considering independent measurements on @xmath88 copies of the state @xmath1 . denoting by @xmath89 the string of all outcomes",
    ", one says that two strings @xmath90 and @xmath91 are exclusive if there exists some @xmath92 such that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are exclusive .",
    "a physical theory satisfies the @xmath88-th level of the hierarchy if the probabilities @xmath95 obey the bound @xmath96 for every set @xmath81 of mutually exclusive strings . in the methods section we show that our principles on sharp measurements imply that this bound is satisfied for every possible @xmath88 .",
    "again , this fact has major consequences on the amount of contextuality that can be found in a theory satisfying our principles .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath97 and invoking a result of ref .",
    "@xcite we have that the structure of sharp measurements implies that the maximum violation of kcbs inequality @xcite is exactly equal to the quantum value .",
    "* derivation of lo .",
    "* in the nonlocality camp , lo occupies a special position , being up to now the only known principle that rules out non - quantum correlations that are not detected by any bipartite principle @xcite .",
    "lo refers to a scenario where @xmath98 parties perform local measurements on @xmath98 systems , initially prepared in some joint state .",
    "the @xmath92-th party can choose among different measurement settings in a set @xmath99 and her measurements give outcomes in another set @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 be the string of all settings , @xmath102 be the string of all outcomes , and @xmath103 be the pair @xmath104 . in this context",
    ", the pair @xmath104 is called an event and two events are called _ locally orthogonal _ iff there exists a party @xmath92 such that @xmath105 and @xmath106 . setting @xmath107 to be the conditional probability distribution @xmath108",
    ", one says that theory satisfies local orthogonality if all the probability distributions generated by local measurements obey the bound @xmath109 for every set @xmath110 of pairwise locally orthogonal events .    to derive lo ,",
    "we specify how the probability distribution @xmath111 is generated : in the most general scenario , the @xmath98 parties share a state @xmath1 and that , for setting @xmath112 , party @xmath92 performs a measurement @xmath113 . denoting the product effects as @xmath114",
    ", the probability distribution of the outcomes is given by @xmath115 .",
    "the proof that lo follows from the principles , provided in methods , consists of three steps : first , thanks to the fundamental sharpness of measurements , the problem is reduced to proving that lo holds for probability distributions generated by sharp local measurements .",
    "then , we observe that , in the case of sharp measurements , locally orthogonal events correspond to orthogonal effects . finally , we use the fact that mutually orthogonal effects can coexist in a single measurement . as a corollary , we obtain the bound @xmath109 , establishing the validity of lo for all the probability distributions generated by measurements in our theory .    like in the case of ce ,",
    "our principles imply the whole hierarchy of extensions of lo introduced in @xcite . the hierarchy is defined as follows : the probabilities @xmath111 satisfy the @xmath88-th level of the hierarchy if their product @xmath116 satisfies lo .",
    "now , we can think of the product as being generated by measurements on @xmath98 copies of the state @xmath1 . in this way , we reduce the problem of proving the @xmath88-th level of the hierarchy to the problem of proving lo for measurements performed on the state @xmath117 .",
    "but we already proved the validity of lo for arbitrary measurements and arbitrary states . in conclusion",
    ", the structure of sharp measurements implies that lo is satisfied at every possible level .",
    "a striking consequence of this argument is that the fundamental sharpness of measurements rules out the ultra - strong nonlocality exhibited by pr box correlations , as the latter violate the lo hierarchy @xcite . in other words , in the world of pr boxes some measurements must be fundamentally noisy .    * sharp bell inequalities . *",
    "the request that measurements are ideal at the fundamental level exerts a censorship on the amount of nonlocality that can be detected by experiments . to illustrate this fact , we show a number of bell inequalities where the sharpness of measurements prevents every violation .",
    "we call such inequalities sharp . consider a game played by @xmath98 non - communicating parties and a referee , who sends to party @xmath92 an input @xmath112 and receives back an output @xmath93 .",
    "the referee chooses the input string @xmath118 at random with probability @xmath119 and assigns a payoff @xmath120 to the players , assumed without loss of generality to be nonnegative for every @xmath121 . the expected payoff obtained by the players",

    "for a given game , the maximum payoff that can be achieved by classical strategies  call it @xmath123defines a bell inequality , @xmath124 .",

    "the graph is not perfect , because the largest clique in the graph has 3 vertices while the number of colours in the graph is 4 . here",

    "examples of such games are the  guess the parity \" game and the  guess the product \" game where the players are win if they guess the product of their inputs .",
    "our results are derived in a minimal framework , which avoids some assumptions commonly made in gpts . in particular",
    ", our arguments do not invoke local tomography @xcite , but only the requirement that sharp measurements are local .",
    "this requirement is strictly weaker : for example , it is satisfied by quantum theory on real hilbert spaces , where local tomography fails .",
    "the validity of our results does not even require that the states of a given physical system form a convex set .",
    "thanks to this feature , the results apply also to non - convex theories , like spekkens toy theory @xcite .",
    "interestingly , probabilities themselves do not play a crucial role in our arguments and it is quite straightforward to extend the results to theories that only specify which outcomes are possible , impossible or certain , without specifying their probabilities , such as schumacher s and westmoreland s toy theory @xcite .    since sharp measurements play a central role in quantum mechanics , it is not surprising that they have been the object of extensive investigation since the early days @xcite .",
    "later , holevo proposed a purely statistical definition of sharp measurement , which does not refer to post - measurement states @xcite .",
    "although in the quantum case holevo s definition reduces to that of projective measurement , in general theories it is inequivalent to ours , and it is not clear how one could use it to derive features like lo and ce .",
    "different notions of ideal measurements were put forward by piron @xcite and beltrametti - cassinelli @xcite in the framework of quantum logic . in general , they differ form our definition in the way the condition of minimal disturbance is defined .",
    "most recently , measurement disturbance came back to play a key role in the search for basic physical principles , as shown by the no disturbance without information principle of ref .",
    "@xcite and by the no disturbance principle of ref .",
    "our work joined the insights from two different approaches to the foundations of quantum mechanics : the characterization of quantum correlations @xcite and the study of general probabilistic theories @xcite . although these two approaches have developed on separate tracks so far , they share the same fundamental goal : understanding which picture of nature lies behind the laws of quantum mechanics and guiding our intuition towards the formulation of new physical theories and new information - processing protocols .",
    "our results demonstrate that the interaction between the two approaches can be highly beneficial for both . here",
    "lo and ce stimulated the search for new principles in the gpt framework , leading to a compelling picture of nature where measurements are repeatable and cause minimal disturbance at the fundamental level .",
    "it is an open question whether other information - theoretic features of quantum correlations , such as non - trivial communication complexity , no - advantage in nonlocal computation , and information causality can be derived in this picture .",
    "furthermore , the idea that a noisy physical process can be reduced to an ideal process at the fundamental level reminds immediately of another quantum feature : purification @xcite . operationally , purification is the property that every mixed state can be generated from a pure state of a composite system by discarding one component .",
    "this principle implies directly entanglement and is at the core of the reconstruction of quantum theory of ref .",
    "our result suggests the possibility that purification and sharpness could be sufficient to single out quantum theory among all possible gpts . in terms of quantum correlations",
    ", this would lead to the tantalizingly simple picture  purification brings nonlocality in , sharpness cuts it down \" . going even further ,",
    "it is intriguing to envisage that purification and sharpness could be viewed as two sides of the same medal by imposing that physical theories must satisfy a requirement of time symmetry , similarly to what was done in quantum theory by aharonov , bergmann and lebowitz @xcite .",

    "( [ alte ] ) , this proves that the instrument @xmath202 is sharp , and so is the corresponding measurement @xmath175 .",
    "the ability to combine orthogonal effects into a single measurement is a powerful asset .",
    "as we already observed , it implies ce at its basic level . in the following",
    "we show that it can be used also to obtain the whole ce hierarchy .",
    "* orthogonality of product effects . * in a causal theory the information available at a given moment of time can be used to make decisions about the settings of future experiments , thus allowing for adaptive measurements where the choice of setting for a system @xmath12 depends on the outcome of a measurement on system @xmath11 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath36 is a sharp measurement on @xmath11 and @xmath203 is a sharp measurement for every @xmath2 , then @xmath204 is a legitimate measurement .",
    "now , the locality of sharp measurements implies that @xmath205 is sharp for every fixed @xmath206 .",
    "since @xmath206 is arbitrary , this means that each effect @xmath207 is sharp and that two effects @xmath207 and @xmath208 are orthogonal unless @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "thanks to this observation , it is easy to see that every level of the ce hierarchy is satisfied .",
    "the key is to note that if two strings of outcomes @xmath90 and @xmath91 are exclusive , then the corresponding effects @xmath211 and @xmath212 are orthogonal .",
    "this is clear because , by definition , the effects corresponding to two exclusive strings are of the form @xmath213 and @xmath214 where the effects @xmath215 and @xmath216 are orthogonal and the effects @xmath217 and @xmath218 are sharp thanks to the locality of sharp measurements . using our result about product effects , we then have that @xmath211 and @xmath219 are orthogonal . now",
    ", a set of mutually exclusive strings @xmath81 corresponds to a set of mutually orthogonal effects @xmath220 . since mutually orthogonal effects can be combined into a joint measurement , the probabilities @xmath221 obey the bound @xmath222 , meaning that the theory satisfies the @xmath88-th level of the ce hierarchy for arbitrary @xmath88 .",
    "note that the same argument can be used to prove the validity of lo for the probability distributions generated in a scenario where all parties perform sharp measurements . in this scenario , two locally orthogonal events @xmath121 and @xmath223 correspond to two orthogonal effects @xmath224 and @xmath225 , for exactly the same reason mentioned above .",
    "hence , the joint measurability of orthogonal effect implies the bound @xmath226 for every set @xmath110 of locally orthogonal events . in other words ,",
    "all the probability distributions generated by sharp measurements obey lo .",
    "* reduction to sharp measurements . *",
    "while ce applies only to sharp measurements , lo applies to arbitrary measurements .",
    "this is because every probability distribution that we can encounter in our theory is a probability distribution generated by sharp measurements .",
    "this fact can be seen as follows : combining the fundamental sharpness with the locality of sharp measurements , one can show that for every party @xmath92 and every measurement @xmath113 , there exists an ancilla @xmath227 , a state of @xmath227 , call it @xmath228 , and a sharp measurement @xmath229 such that @xmath230 for every @xmath112 and for every @xmath93 ( see the appendix for the proof ) .",
    "now , since all measurements that party @xmath92 can perform can be replaced by sharp measurements by adding an ancilla in a fixed state @xmath228 , the input - output distribution @xmath111 generated by arbitrary measurements on the state @xmath1 coincides with the input - output distribution generated by sharp measurements on the state @xmath231 . in other words , at the level of correlations there is no difference between sharp and non - sharp measurements . thanks to this fact , deriving lo for sharp measurements is equivalent to deriving lo for arbitrary measurements .",

    "<S> nonlocality @xcite and contextuality @xcite are among the most striking features of quantum mechanics , in radical conflict with the worldview of classical physics . </S>",

    "<S> the observation that quantum theory is not maximally contextual made an early appearance in kochen s and specker s work @xcite , but it was not until recently that it caught broad attention in the community @xcite , initiating a search for principles that characterize the quantum set of contextual probability distributions . on this front , </S>",
    "<S> the only principle put forward so far is consistent exclusivity ( ce ) @xcite . despite many successes , </S>",
    "<S> a complete characterization of the quantum set is still extremely challenging @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what makes the problem hard is the fact that  intendedly  the principles considered so far dealt only with input - output probability distributions , without making any hypothesis on how these distributions are generated . on the other hand , a physical theory does not provide only probability distributions , but also specifies rules on how to combine physical systems together , how to measure them , and how to evolve their state in time @xcite . considering that fundamental quantum features like no - cloning and universal computation can not be expressed just in terms of input - output distributions , </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to wonder whether also quantum nonlocality and contextuality could be better understood in a broader framework of general probabilistic theories ( gpts ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further motivation to extend the framework comes from the latest principles in the nonlocality and contextuality camps : lo and ce . </S>",
    "<S> both principles refer to a notion of orthogonal events and impose that the sum of the probabilities of a set of mutually orthogonal events shall not exceed one . </S>",
    "<S> this is a powerful requirement , which in the case of lo is even capable to rule out non - quantum correlations that are compatible with every bipartite principle @xcite . but </S>",
    "<S> why should nature obey such a requirement ? and what does this requirement tell us about the fundamental laws that govern physical processes ? </S>",

    "<S> we introduce a class of ideal measurements , called sharp , that are repeatable and cause the minimal amount of disturbance on future observations . </S>",
    "<S> we postulate that all measurements are sharp at the fundamental level and we explain the apparent unsharpness of realistic experiments as due to the interaction with the environment surrounding the measured system . assuming that sharp measurements remain sharp under elementary operations , such as joining two outcomes together and applying two measurements in parallel , we show that the fundamental sharpness of measurements implies the validity of ce and lo , thus providing a strong constraint on the set of probability distributions and bringing down the violation of bell and kochen - specker inequalities near to their quantum value . </S>",
    "<S> our result demonstrates that principles formulated in the broader framework of gpts can offer an extra power in the characterization of the quantum set and identifies the fundamental sharpness of measurements as a candidate principle for future axiomatizations of quantum theory . </S>"
