    "melting transitions @xcite are of both technical and theoretical interest . under suitable experimental circumstances one can study the melting process in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "if the interparticle interactions are simple , the lowest - energy crystalline order in 2d is a close - packed triangular .",
    "it is observable for electrons on a liquid - helium surface @xcite , for adsorbed noble - gas atoms floating on an incommensurate substrate @xcite , for colloidal suspensions of highly charged spheres confined between parallel glass plates @xcite , for paramagnetic colloidal crystals @xcite , and for vortex lattices in thin films @xcite .",
    "simulation experiments provide us with further examples : rigid disks @xcite , gaussian cores @xcite , and particles interacting with lennard - jones @xcite as well as coulomb forces ( wigner lattice ) @xcite .",
    "there are various theories of 2d melting @xcite .",
    "most popular is the phenomenological theory of halperin , nelson , and young @xcite which , inspired by the kosterlitz and thouless ( kt ) theory of vortices in superfluid films @xcite , explains the transition by the statistical behavior of defects .",
    "this kthny theory suggests that melting could proceed in a sequence of two continuous kt transitions , the first caused by the unbinding of dislocations , the second by the unbinding of disclinations .",
    "such a sequence was indeed found in some 2d crystals experimentally and by simulations .",
    "there are also explicit models on square lattices which allow to study defect melting in detail .",
    "these models are minimal in the sense that they contain the correct harmonic elastic energy and no anharmonic terms .",
    "the defects arise from integer - valued plastic gauge fields which account for the thermal creation and annihilation of dislocations and disclinations .",
    "the simplest such model shows only a single first - order melting transition @xcite . only after introducing an extra higher - gradient elastic term which gives the crystal a tunable angular stiffness",
    ", the first - order transition separates into two successive kt transitions @xcite .",
    "this splitting can be observed in the laboratory , for instance in xenon overlayer lattices on graphite @xcite",
    ".    presently investigated systems live mostly on triangular lattices , and these seem to melt in two steps @xcite , except for the gaussian core model .",
    "the question arises whether a minimal melting model living on a triangular lattice will always undergo two successive transitions at the level of first gradient elastic energies only , so that no extra higher - gradient terms are needed for splitting them as on square lattices .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to answer this question to the affirmative .",
    "we shall generalize the previously constructed lattice models from square lattices @xcite to triangular lattices and find , indeed , strong indications that they melt in two kt transitions .",
    "a universal feature of all such defect models is that it is the combined separation of dislocations and disclinations which makes the melting transition first - order @xcite .",
    "dislocations alone would cause a similar phase transition as in superfluid helium , which undergoes a continuous transition .",
    "an important virtue of the lattice defect models on square lattices was that they lead to a simple universal melting formula @xcite determining the melting point in terms of the elastic constants .",
    "the result is obtained from a lowest - order approximation , which combines the high - temperature expansion of the defect contributions to the free energy density with the low - temperature expansion .",
    "the melting temperature is determined by the intersection of the two curves .",
    "this turns out to produce precisely the time - honored lindemann criterion .",
    "in addition , however , there is a _ prediction _ of the universal value of the lindemann number where melting occurs .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation was demonstrated quantitatively for square lattices in 3d and 2d @xcite .",
    "recently , the results were successfully extended to face - centered and body - centered cubic lattices in 3d @xcite .",
    "we shall find a similar formula for triangular lattices in 2d .",
