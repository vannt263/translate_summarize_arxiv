    "lattice studies of hadronic matrix elements require matching between operators in full continuum qcd and those in the lattice theory being simulated . in the present article",
    "we will focus on an effective lattice theory which combines nonrelativistic ( nrqcd ) heavy quarks and clover light quarks .",
    "we wish to match the theories correct through @xmath0 .    for heavy meson ( e.g. @xmath1 and @xmath2 )",
    "leptonic and semileptonic decays , the relevant operators are heavy - light vector and axial vector currents , denoted in the continuum theory as @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the first question that arises concerns the number and type of operators required in the effective theory .",

    "again there is an @xmath11 discretization correction to @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 and    @xmath29    the desired relation between qcd hadronic matrix elements and nonperturbatively determined lattice current matrix elements is hence , @xmath30 and similarly for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the matching coefficients , @xmath33 , have the following perturbative expansion ,    @xmath34    @xmath35    the goal is to calculate the @xmath36 s .",
    "in the continuum theory we employ on - shell renormalization with naive dimensional regularization and the @xmath37 scheme .",
    "a gluon mass is introduced to handle ir divergences that eventually cancel between continuum and the lattice .",
    "the light quark mass is set equal to zero . on the lattice we worked mainly with an nrqcd action correct through @xmath38 .",
    "results with higher order relativistic corrections also exist .",
    "the lattice light quarks are massless clover fermions .",
    "the light and heavy quark actions and the lattice current operators are all tadpole improved .",

    "we plot the one - loop coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , for all four current types , @xmath42 , @xmath32 , @xmath43 , and @xmath31 versus the inverse dimensionless bare heavy quark mass @xcite .",
    "the `` bursts '' show @xmath39 with @xmath44 fixed to @xmath45 , where the choice of @xmath46 is somewhat arbitary , corresponding to the value of the bare dimensionless heavy quark mass appropriate for the physical @xmath47-quark on @xmath48gev lattices . with the logarithmic dependence taken out",
    "one can compare with @xmath39 for the static theory , as indicated for @xmath42 and @xmath43@xcite .",
    "one also sees that @xmath49 ( the `` diamonds '' ) goes to a non - vanishing value as @xmath50 .",
    "this is due to the mixing with the discretization correction , @xmath51 .",
