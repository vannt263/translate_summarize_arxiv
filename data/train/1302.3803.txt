    "the idea of quantum mechanics on graphs has been introduced in the last century . during the last 30 years , it has been developed into a powerful tool for the study of particles on tiny graph - like structures @xcite . since a graph is a one - dimensional variety , the analysis of a particle on a graph consists in solving a system of _ ordinary _ differential equations , which makes the graph models simple from the mathematical point of view .",
    "therefore , quantum mechanics on graphs can serve also as a useful laboratory for the study of various complex quantum phenomena in a simple setting .    here",
    "we examine the influence of the topology of quantum graphs on spectral properties , taking inspiration from the works @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we may regard that the topology change mimics a macroscopic or violent variation of systems , e.g. , the rupture and connection of quantum wires .",
    "we will show that a parametric evolution of an eigenenergy may form an open trajectory along a cycle involving the topology changes of graphs .",
    "if this is the case , the trajectory of the corresponding eigenspace also forms an open cycle .",
    "such a discrepancy of eigenobjects is called quantum anholonomy @xcite .",

    "let the first two lines be sticked together at their outer endpoints to form a ring of length @xmath1 , and likewise , the second two lines be sticked together at their outer endpoints to form a ring of length @xmath2 , giving the whole object the shape of the character `` @xmath3 '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we assume there is no potential on the lines outside the central vertex .",
    "therefore , a quantum particle confined to this object moves freely on the lines , and the only non - trivial part of the system is the connection condition of the wave function at the node .",
    "we assign the coordinates @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] to the left and the right ring .",
    "the values @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the inner endpoints 1 and 3 , respectively , whereas the values @xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond to the inner endpoints 2 and 4 , see fig .",
    "the behavior of a particle in the central vertex of degree @xmath8 is determined by a boundary condition in the vertex .",
    "the general form of a boundary condition in a vertex of degree @xmath9 follows from the study of self - adjoint extensions of the laplacian operator on a graph .",
    "the boundary condition consists of @xmath9 equations connecting the boundary values and derivatives that can be written in the form @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are vectors formed from the values of the wave function in the vertex and from its derivatives ( taken in the outgoing sense ) , respectively , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are @xmath15 complex matrices with the property @xmath16 with @xmath17 denoting the @xmath18 matrix composed from the columns of the matrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for the graph depicted in figure  [ fig1 ]",

    "the interval @xmath35 $ ] can be divided into six regions , in each of them the vector @xmath36 has a different structure of zero and nonzero entries . as we show below , these regions correspond to mutually different topologies of the system .",

    "the system is topologically equivalent to two rings connected at a single point since all four endpoints are connected together at the central node .",
    "therefore , with the parameter change @xmath76 , seven distinct topologies are traversed in a continuous manner .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "the system is never identical for any two different values of @xmath28 in @xmath77 , because the the functions @xmath23 to @xmath27 form district combinations of patterns in all six regions .      as an additional model",

    "the system wave functions can be written in the form @xmath79 in this notation , we have @xmath80 with @xmath81 the spectra of the system can be calculated from the secular equation @xmath82 and ratio @xmath83 result in a quantum anholonomy . below we present the results , separately for the long and the short cycle .",
    "we first consider the long cycle of parameter change represented by ( [ locyc ] ) .",
    "we performed a numerical calculation of the spectra of the system for six different settings of the parameters @xmath84 .",
    "we studied two combinations of @xmath85 , namely    * @xmath86 , @xmath87 , * @xmath88 , @xmath89 ,    and for each of them , we considered three different ratios @xmath83 ( with @xmath90 ) , namely    * the golden mean @xmath91 , * the silver mean @xmath92 , * the bronze mean @xmath93 .",
    "we explain the numerical result shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the spectra have period @xmath29 as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "this is because all the hamiltonians are @xmath29 periodic by construction . on the other hand , however , some wavenumber do not have the @xmath29 periodicity .",
    "for example , let us keep track of the wavenumber ( say @xmath94 ) of the ground state at @xmath40 in the uppermost figure .",
    "around @xmath95 , @xmath94 increase suddenly and form three crossings with another eigenstates .",
    "because the graphs consist of two disjoint parts , these crossings are not avoided .",
    "the eigenfunction corresponding to @xmath94 is localized within a disjoint fragment , and the other three eigenfunctions involving the crossings are localized in the other part . hence , as a result of a @xmath29-cycle of @xmath28 , @xmath94 becomes the wavenumber of the third excited state .",
    "this is an example of anholonomy in eigenvalue and eigenspace .",
    "some other wavenumbers , e.g. , 4-th excited state at @xmath40 in the leftmost figure , are not involved by the anholonomy . by changing the ratio @xmath83",
    ", we see various patterns of the quantum anholonomy .",
    "also , the anholonomies appear in various choice of the parameters , cf .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "let us proceed to the simplified cycle represented by ( [ shcyc ] ) , in which four distinct topologies are connected in a single sequence .",
    "the spectra as functions of the angle parameter @xmath96 have been calculated for the choice of parameters @xmath89 , @xmath88 and @xmath83 attaining the value of the golden mean , the silver mean and the bronze mean .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "the boundary condition   represents a certain singular potential in the vertex that has in general a highly nontrivial nature .",
    "as it has been shown in @xcite , the physical content of a generic boundary condition corresponds to a set of infinitely strong @xmath97 potentials sited in points in an infinitely small web located in the vertex .",
    "we sketch how the webs look like for the boundary conditions of our model in figures [ fig10 ] , [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] . in all of the finite approximations",
    ", the parameter @xmath98 has to be chosen small with respect to the wavelength of the particle . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the approximation effectively produces the boundary conditions  .",
    "the result has been obtained using the formulas from @xcite .",
    "it illustrates in a simple way the relation between the global topology of the system and the topology of the internal infinitely small web .",
    "the creation of the anholonomy in our model can be explained in the following way . in regions",
    "i , iv , v and vi , when the graph consists of a single component , the eigenvalues as functions of the system parameter @xmath28 can change their values , but they never cross each other , because generically there will be avoided crossings .",
    "however , in regions ii and iii , the graph is separated into two components ( two lines or two rings ) , i.e. , the system is in fact made up of two independent entities , both having its own energy levels that can independently vary with change of the system parameter @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , if the parametrization of boundary conditions is conveniently chosen , the eigenvalues as functions of @xmath28 can cross each other , which leads to the anholonomy effect .",
