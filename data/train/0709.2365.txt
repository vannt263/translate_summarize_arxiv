    "in cosmology , the study of gravitational waves created through physical processes in the early universe provides a unique window to initial stages of the universe .",
    "significant efforts are being made to detect possible signatures of tensor mode perturbations of space - time geometry through measurements of the polarization in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . since quantum gravity effects",
    "could play a significant role in the very early universe , it is of interest to study possible quantum gravity effects on gravitational wave propagation during these periods . in the last few years , applications of the method used in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite , a candidate quantum theory of gravity , to early universe cosmology have led to significant progress .",
    "in particular , the quantization of homogeneous cosmological models known as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite has led to a resolution of the big bang singularity @xcite , and techniques have become available to include inhomogeneous perturbations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study typical quantum gravity effects for tensor modes that are expected from loop quantum gravity . in particular , we consider the effects on gravitational wave dynamics expected from corrections to classically divergent inverse powers of metric components and from the use of holonomies in the quantum theory instead of connection components . to study the dynamics we compute gravitational wave equations together with their dispersion relations .    in section",
    "[ classical ] , we present a derivation of tensor mode equations in ashtekar variables .",
    "the calculations are purely canonical and split off the tensor mode in the metric from the outset .",
    "this mimics the usual covariant derivations as far as possible in a way accessible to canonical quantizations .",
    "other canonical derivations exist @xcite which due to their explicit use of dirac observables appear more difficult to use in quantizations . in the following section , we consider the effects of quantum corrections to the inverse volume in hamiltonian and compute the correspondingly corrected tensor mode equation .",
    "after that , we consider a second quantum effect due to the use of holonomies in a loop quantization .",
    "from the corrected wave equations one can easily derive the corresponding dispersion relations .",
    "quantum gravity corrections are sensitive to the underlying discreteness of a quantum state , which in general changes as the universe expands .",
    "thus , also propagation speeds derived from the corrected dispersion relations are functions of time , providing in particular a varying speed of light scenario .",
    "both corrections are typical of loop quantum gravity and thus test its basic features .",
    "the dispersion relations in particular allow one to investigate possible violations of causality which would arise if the propagation velocity of gravitational waves would turn out to be larger than the speed of light .",
    "in fact , we will see that gravitational waves travel faster than the classical speed of light , but not faster than the physical speed of light which is also subject to quantum corrections from an underlying discrete geometry .",
    "quantum corrections to the gravitational and electromagnetic dynamics are related by the requirement of anomaly freedom , which can directly be implemented at the effective level and implies that physical causality is preserved .",

    "here we use the convention that greek letters denote space - time indices whereas small latin letters denote spatial indices .",
    "the symmetric metric perturbation field @xmath6 is transverse and traceless , i.e.  it satisfies @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "this provides separate canonical structures for the background and perturbations , but these variables will be coupled dynamically . in particular , the homogeneous background dynamics would receive back - reaction effects at quadratic or higher order .",

    "there are three types of constraints : the gauss constraint which generates local rotations of the triad , the diffeomorphism constraint which generates spatial diffeomorphisms and the hamiltonian constraint which completes the space - time diffeomorphisms and is thus relevant for the dynamics . for linear perturbations including only the tensor mode , the corresponding gauss constraint is trivially satisfied as the perturbation field @xmath42 is symmetric .",

    "one can identify @xmath40 with the fiducial volume introduced earlier .",

    "while there are no such anomalies in the constraint algebra for tensor modes as the diffeomorphism constraint is trivial here , the same quantum correction function @xmath84 as for the vector mode must occur since there is only one hamiltonian constraint which is just split into different mode contributions to simplify the analysis .",

    "a loop quantization represents holonomies as basic operators on a hilbert space rather than connection components .",
    "moreover , it is impossible to derive operators for connection components from holonomies and thus any quantized expression depending on the connection must do so through holonomies .",
    "this is especially true for the hamiltonian constraint , which thus receives quantum corrections from higher powers of the connection .",
    "holonomies are non - linear as well as ( spatially ) non - local in connection components .",

    "the classical tensor mode equation ( [ classtensoreqn ] ) then simply implies @xmath141 here we have ignored the friction term in the equation of motion ( [ classtensoreqn ] ) since we are mainly interested in local propagation not involving cosmic scales . the dispersion relation ( [ classdr ] )",
    "is , of course , the standard classical dispersion relation between the frequency @xmath139 and the proper wave number @xmath142 .",
    "we further note that the corresponding group velocity of gravitational waves @xmath143 is equal to @xmath144 ( in natural units ) .      repeating the calculations of the classical case but using quantum corrections in the wave equation",

    "as one can see , the quantum correction function multiplies the wave number @xmath146 , thus affecting the mode on all scales .",
    "moreover , given that @xmath147 , the corrected group velocity due to inverse volume corrections is greater than unity .",
    "this may appear as a violation of causality since gravitational waves would travel faster than with the speed of light .",
    "however , this refers to the classical speed of light , while a physical statement requires us to compare the velocity to the physical speed of light .",

    "to determine whether causality is respected by the quantum corrections , we have to compare the propagation speed of gravitational waves to the physical speed of light .",
    "just as tensor perturbations of the metric receive quantum gravity corrections , the electromagnetic field also is corrected .",
