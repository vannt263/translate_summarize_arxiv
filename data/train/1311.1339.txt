    "study of timing channels , i.e. , channels that arise when the information is being encoded in the transmission times of messages , has resulted in many interesting and relevant models .",
    "two important and relatively recent examples are the models adopted from queuing theory @xcite and those that arise in molecular communications @xcite .",
    "we analyze here the problem of _ zero - error _ communication over certain channels of this type .",
    "the study is partly motivated by settings in which the communication is done with rather unconventional physical carriers , such as particles , molecules , items , etc .",
    "these channels can also be viewed as discrete - time queues with bounded waiting times , and the results can thus be seen as supplementing in a sense the work carried out in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; however , due to the combinatorial nature of zero - error information theory @xcite , the methods used are quite different from those in @xcite .",
    "we assume that multiple transmissions can occur at the same time instant without interfering with each other . in this regard",
    ", we will use the term _ particle _ ( instead of _ symbol _ or _ packet _ ) for the unit of transmission .",
    "we believe that this convention will make the discussion clearer .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the set of nonnegative integers @xmath10 .",
    "the discrete - time particle channel with parameters @xmath11 , denoted dtpc(@xmath12 ) , is the communication channel described by the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "time is slotted , meaning that the particles are sent and received in integer time instants ; 2 .   at most @xmath0 particles",
    "are sent in each time slot ; 3 .",
    "every particle is delayed in the channel for a number of slots chosen randomly from the set @xmath1 ; 4 .",
    "the particles are indistinguishable , and hence the information is conveyed via timing only , or equivalently , via the number of particles in each slot .",
    "@xmath13    ) .",
    "the particles are numbered only for the purpose of illustration , they are assumed identical . ]",
    "we elaborate briefly on the definition of the dtpc .",
    "if the duration of the transmission is @xmath14 slots , then the assumption 4 ) implies that the sequence of particles can be identified with an @xmath14-tuple of integers @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents the number of particles in the @xmath17th slot .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : channel ] illustrates a situation where the transmitted sequence is @xmath18 and the received sequence is @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the dtpc can be defined purely in terms of sequences of nonnegative integers , and in the rest of the paper we will rely entirely on this representation .    as for the assumption 3 ) , observe that if the delays of the particles were unbounded ( as is the case , e.g. , in queues having service times with geometric distribution @xcite ) , the zero - error capacity would be zero .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain interesting models , some restrictions on the delays have to be imposed .",
    "similarly , if there is no restriction on the number of particles sent in each slot , then the zero - error capacity is infinite for any @xmath20 , which justifies the assumption 2 ) .",
    "note that we have not imposed a restriction on the number of particles at the output of the dtpc(@xmath12 ) in a single slot ( though it is obviously bounded by @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is not hard to argue that this does not affect the zero - error capacity of the above channel , i.e. , it would be the same if this number were also bounded by @xmath0 .",
    "this is proven in appendix [ app_nparticlesreceived ] .",
    "let us also give several more concrete interpretations of the dtpc .",
    "namely , the  particles \" referred to in the definition of this channel can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context , e.g. , as :    *  molecules \" in the so - called molecular communications , where the transmission of information via the number of molecules and their emission times is considered .",
    "the molecules are usually assumed identical , and their arrival times are random due to their interaction with the fluid medium .",
    "the codes described in the present paper are relevant precisely for the channels of this type , at least in discrete - time models @xcite . *",
    " customers \" in queuing systems , an important example of which are queues of  packets \" formed in network routers ( see the discussion in remark [ rem : queues ] below ) .",
    "* `` packets '' in channels introducing random delays ( caused by effects different than queuing ) .",
    "note that the packets referred to in this and the previous paragraph are not identical in practice and usually carry information via their contents . in this paper",
    "we will be interested in the transmission of information via _ timing only _",
    ", similarly as in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can imagine a receiver that is not processing the packets ( e.g. , a low power node in a wireless sensor network ) , but only infers their arrivals through energy detection .",
    "*  energy quanta \" in a simultaneous transmission of energy and information @xcite .",
    "[ rem : queues ] we have pointed out already that the results of the paper apply also to queuing systems of certain type .",
    "we introduce them here in a bit more detail .",
    "denote by dtqr(@xmath12 ) the discrete - time queue with @xmath0 servers / processors ( meaning that @xmath0 particles can be processed simultaneously ) , with at most @xmath0 arrivals per slot , and with residence times bounded by @xmath22 slots ( the residence time of the particle is the total time that it spends in the queue , either waiting to be processed or being processed ) .",
    "it is not difficult to argue that the dtpc(@xmath12 ) and the dtqr(@xmath12 ) have identical zero - error codes and zero - error capacities .",
    "the key difference between these channels is that the delays of the particles in the dtpc are independent , while in the dtqr they are not as they are affected also by the service procedure ( for example , in fifo queues the particles can not be reordered ) .",
    "the assumption that the particles are identical , however , makes this difference irrelevant in the zero - error case .",

    "@xmath13    in words , no two sequences of codewords of @xmath54 can produce the same channel output , and hence there is no confusion about which sequence was sent .",

    "this problem can easily be circumvented by simply padding each codeword with @xmath22 zeros ( empty slots , in the original terminology ) .",
