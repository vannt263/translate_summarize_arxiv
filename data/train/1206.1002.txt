    "recently , the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc @xcite have reported an excess in the gamma - gamma mode at about 125gev , which may be a signal of the higgs boson . in the standard model ( sm ) , a light higgs boson is the evidence of the weakly coupled higgs sector . in models for physics beyond the sm ,",
    "however , the light higgs boson does not always correspond to a weakly coupled theory .",
    "the scenario based on little higgs models @xcite is an example of a strongly coupled theory with a light higgs boson , where the higgs boson arises as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson originating from the breaking of some strongly interacting global symmetry at the tev scale , and the higgs boson mass is kept to be light .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive candidates for the physics beyond the sm .",
    "susy can solve the gauge hierarchy problem , as the quadratic divergence in the radiative correction to the higgs boson mass is cancelled owing to the non - renormalization theorem . in addition , elementary scalar fields are automatically introduced in the susy theory .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal susy extension of the sm ( mssm ) necessarily contains two higgs doublets . in the mssm ,",
    "the coupling constants in the higgs potential are determined by the electroweak gauge couplings , and the mass of the sm - like higgs boson is less than the @xmath6 boson mass at the tree level . with significant radiative corrections due to the large top yukawa coupling @xcite",
    ", the higgs mass can be pushed up to around 125gev in the case of very large stop masses or very large left - right stop mixing .    even within the framework based on susy , models with",
    "strongly coupled light higgs boson can be constructed .",
    "a possible way is to introduce additional r - parity - even chiral superfields which strongly couple to the higgs sector but the f - terms of which do not contribute to the higgs boson four - point coupling . in this case , the sm - like higgs boson is kept to be light .",
    "the strong couplings have rich phenomenological implications .",
    "first , radiative corrections involving the strongly coupled new fields can raise the sm - like higgs boson mass to 125gev with rather natural choice of the stop masses and mixing .",
    "second , the strongly coupled fields significantly contribute to the triple sm - like higgs boson coupling through loop effects , so that it deviates by a few tens percent from the sm prediction @xcite .",
    "a similar non - decoupling effect tends to enhance the first order electroweak phase transition @xcite .    in the mssm",
    ", it is not easy to make the first order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) strong enough to satisfy the sphaleron decoupling condition @xcite , which is required by the successful electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the non - decoupling quantum effect of the additional scalar bosons through strong f - term coupling with the higgs boson enhances the first order ewpt , and the difficulty in the mssm can be significantly relaxed .",
    "the enhancement requires a light sm - like higgs boson because its mass works as a suppression factor , and the 125gev higgs boson is consistent with the scenario .",
    "for example , the first order ewpt can be enough strong in a susy model whose higgs sector contains four doublets and two charged singlets @xcite . in this model , the coupling among the higgs boson and the extra bosons in the scalar potential can be taken to be strong , while the quartic self - coupling constants of the higgs boson are determined only by the d - term ; i.e. , by the electroweak gauge couplings , and the higgs mass remains light .",
    "when we explore a more fundamental picture of models with strong couplings and a light higgs boson , a quite different landscape from the grand unified theory ( gut ) over the grand desert presents itself to us . in models with strong couplings ,",
    "coupling constants tend to blow up quickly through the renormalization group running . with sufficiently strong coupling consistent with successful electroweak baryogenesis",
    ", the landau pole appears at the energy scale of multi - tev to 10 tev , which is much lower than the gut scale , @xmath7gev .",
    "there should be a cutoff scale below the energy scale where one comes across the landau pole .",
    "the physics above the cutoff scale might be controlled by some strong dynamics .",
    "the minimal susy fat higgs model @xcite is an example of the theory above the cutoff scale of a susy model with strongly coupled higgs sector .",
    "this model is based on the strong @xmath8 susy gauge theory with three pairs of doublets , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . below the cutoff scale , higgs iso - spin doublets , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and a neutral singlet , @xmath14 ,",
    "appear as composite fields of @xmath15 s , and the other composite fields are decoupled due to their heavy masses .",
    "the low - energy effective theory is described by the superpotential @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a coupling constant and @xmath18 is a dimensionful parameter .",
    "the effective theory is identical to the nearly mssm ( nmssm ) @xcite .",
    "the quartic coupling of the higgs boson gets a @xmath19 contribution through the f - term .",
    "since the higgs mass is dominated by the @xmath20 term with @xmath21gev , the strong coupling tends to enhance the higgs mass . for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the sm - like higgs boson",
    "mass is as large as 200gev , which weakens the first order ewpt too much .",
    "extensions of the minimal susy fat higgs model to @xmath24 and @xmath25 are discussed in refs .",
    "compositeness in susy models is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new uv - complete model whose low - energy effective theory accomodates strong couplings and a light higgs boson .",
    "the model is based on @xmath26 susy gauge theory with three pairs of @xmath26 doublets .",
    "this model leads to two pairs of @xmath27 and @xmath28 iso - spin doublet composite superfields as well as several iso - spin singlet composite superfields in the low - energy description , which cause flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) . to avoid such dangerous fcncs ,",
    "we here impose an additional @xmath29 parity on the model , which is unbroken spontaneously .",
    "this @xmath29 parity can supply a new candidate for dark matter , in addition to the @xmath30-parity .",
    "in our model , unlike the minimal susy fat higgs model , the @xmath29-even singlet field @xmath14 can be heavy enough to decouple from the low - energy effective theory , but many composite fields remain light .",
    "the higgs sector contains two @xmath29-even doublets which are identical to the mssm - like higgs doublets and various extra @xmath29-odd superfields such as a pair of doublets , two charged singlets and two neutral singlets .",
    "the sm - like higgs boson mass of 125 gev can be realized in a natural way because the f - terms of the @xmath29-odd superfields contribute to the mass not at the tree level but at the one - loop level .",
    "on the other hand , non - decoupling contributions of these fields in radiative corrections affect the triple higgs boson coupling significantly  @xcite , and can make the first order ewpt strong enough through the large f - term coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "in section 2 , we present the basic framework of @xmath31 susy qcd theory with the @xmath29 parity , whose low - energy description gives a composite susy higgs model . in section 3 ,",
    "we investigate general features of the composite susy higgs sector .",
    "generally , f - terms involving a large coupling @xmath17 contribute to the sm - like higgs boson mass at the tree level , giving rise to a sm - like higgs boson much heavier than 125 gev , as in the minimal susy fat higgs model . in section 4 , we consider an extended model where we obtain the sm - like higgs boson as light as 125 gev in a natural way .",
    "it turns out that its low - energy effective theory describes the phenomenological model in ref .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "we introduce a new @xmath32 gauge group , denoted by @xmath33 , and six chiral superfields , denoted by @xmath34 , which are doublets of @xmath31 . @xmath35",
    "s are also charged under sm gauge groups @xmath36 .",
    "we further assign a @xmath37 parity to them .",
    "sm charge and @xmath29 parity assignments to @xmath15 s are described in table 1 .    .",
    "sm charge and @xmath29 parity assignments on the @xmath31 doublets , @xmath15 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the f - terms from the couplings among the mssm - like higgs doublets , the @xmath29-odd doublets and the charged singlets can significantly enhance the first order electroweak phase transition if the coupling constant is as large as @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath29-odd neutral singlets can also contribute to making the phase transition stronger by the precise enhancement mechanism .",
    "then the sphaleron decoupling condition required by successful electroweak baryogenesis is satisfied more easily . on the benchmark points chosen in the analysis ,",
    "the first order electroweak phase transition is strong enough .",
    "we have shown that the susy qcd theory with @xmath0 and @xmath1 with one fundamental singlet @xmath39 can give the strongly coupled higgs sector containing four iso - spin doublets , two charged singlets and two neutral singlets as the low - energy description .",
    "since the cutoff scale @xmath2 is as low as multi - tev to 10 tev , the coupling constant @xmath17 in the higgs sector is as large as @xmath40 . in our model , however , the sm - like higgs boson is naturally light because the f - terms do not contribute to its mass at the tree level , while radiative corrections involving strongly coupled fields in the higgs sector are large enough to raise the sm - like higgs boson mass to 125 gev .",
    "we comment on collider signatures of our model .",
    "the model contains many new @xmath29-odd charged and neutral scalars and fermions with masses of several hundred gev .",
    "the lightest one is definitely stable beacuse of the @xmath29 parity .- odd scalar and fermion can be both stable if their mass difference is smaller than the lightest @xmath30-parity odd , @xmath29-even particle .",
    "] at the lhc , @xmath29-odd particles are pair - produced through electroweak interactions , and decay into two lightest @xmath29-odd particles , two lightest @xmath30-parity odd particles and several sm particles .",
    "( for early studies , see refs .",
    "the most clear signatures of the model are events with two or three leptons and large missing transverse momentum . the results from the searches for slepton , chargino and neutralino direct productions by atlas collaboration @xcite apply to our model .",
    "the current bound @xcite is mild and our benchmark spectra of table 5 may not have been excluded yet .    at the tree - level , the sm - like higgs boson couples to mssm particles in the same way as the mssm .",
    "it also couples to @xmath29-odd particles through large coupling constant @xmath17 , but its decay width and branching ratios at the tree - level are not altered if the mass of the light @xmath29-odd particle is larger than half the sm - like higgs boson mass",
    ". the branching ratio into two photons can be significantly affected by loop corrections involving @xmath29-odd charged scalars and fermions that strongly couples to the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "they can enhance or suppress the branching ratio depending on the parameters . also , the triple coupling for the sm - like higgs boson , which has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , receives large corrections from loops involving @xmath29-odd doublets and singlets .",
    "it thus significantly deviates from the sm prediction , and such deviation can be observed through future collider experiments .",
    "finally we comment on a possible extension of the model . in the present model ,",
    "the large coupling constant @xmath17 with the 125 gev sm - like higgs boson can make the first order electroweak phase transition strong enough to enable electroweak baryongenesis @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lightest @xmath29-odd field can be another source of dark matter than the lightest @xmath30-parity - odd field as long as it is electrically neutral .",
    "furthermore , the model can be extended to explain the tiny neutrino masses . by introducing @xmath29-odd right - handed neutrino superfields whose majorana masses are at the tev scale ,",
    "the tiny neutrino masses can be generated at loop levels @xcite . with this extension of the model",
    ", we may be able to build the testable theory in which baryon asymmetry of the universe , dark matter and the tiny neutrino masses can be simultaneously explained from the uv - complete susy strong dynamics around multi - tev to 10 tev without excessive fine - tuning .",
