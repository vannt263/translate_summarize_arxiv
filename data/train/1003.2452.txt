    "the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on - board the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ; 1991@xmath82000 ) was the first to detect high - energy emission from grbs .",

    "this high - energy spectral component had @xmath16 times more energy and lasted longer ( @xmath14s ) than the low - energy ( hard x - ray to soft gamma - ray ) spectral component ( which lasted several tens of seconds ) , and may be naturally explained as inverse - compton emission from the forward - reverse shock system that is formed as the ultra - relativistic grb outflow is decelerated by the external medium  @xcite .",

    "the dominant liv term is associated with the lowest order non - zero term in the sum , of order @xmath53 , which is usually assumed to be either linear ( @xmath54 ) or quadratic ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "taking into account cosmological effects  @xcite , this induces a time delay ( or lag ) in the arrival of a high - energy photon of energy @xmath61 , compared to a low - energy photon of energy @xmath62 ( emitted simultaneously at the same location ) , of @xmath63 here we concentrate on our results for a linear energy dependence ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "we have applied this formula to the highest energy photon detected in grb  080916c , with an energy of @xmath65gev , which arrived at @xmath66s after the grb trigger ( i.e. the onset of the @xmath67mev emission ) .",
    "since it is hard to associate the highest energy photon with a particular spike in the low - energy lightcurve , we have made the conservative assumption that it was emitted anytime after the grb trigger , i.e. @xmath68 , in order to obtain a limit for the sub - luminal case ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath69 .",
    "this was the strictest limit of its kind  @xcite , at that time .",
    "however , the next very bright lat grb , 090510 , was short and had very narrow sharp spikes in its light curve ( see fig  [ fig:090510-liv ] ) , thus enabling us to do even better  @xcite . our main results for grb  090510 are summarized in table  [ tab : liv ] .",
    "the first 4 limits are based on a similar method as described above for grb  080916c , using the highest energy photon , @xmath70gev , and assuming that its emission time @xmath71 was after the start of a relevant lower energy emission episode : @xmath72 .",
    "these 4 limits correspond to different choices of @xmath73 , which are shown by the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:090510-liv ] .",
    "we conservatively used the low end of the @xmath74 confidence interval for the highest energy photon ( @xmath75gev ) and for the redshift ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the most conservative assumption of this type is associating @xmath73 with the onset of any detectable emission from grb  090510 , namely the start of the small precursor that gbm triggered on , leading to @xmath77 .",
    "however , it is highly unlikely that the @xmath78gev photon is indeed associated with the small precursor .",
    "it is much more likely associated with the main soft gamma - ray emission , leading to @xmath79 . moreover , for any reasonable emission spectrum , the emission of the @xmath78gev photon would be accompanied by the emission of a large number of lower energy photons , which would suffer a much smaller time delay due to liv effects , and would therefore mark its emission time .",
    "we could easily detect such photons in energies above @xmath0mev , and therefore the fact that significant high - energy emission is observed only at later times ( see fig .  [ fig:090510-liv ] ) strongly argues that the @xmath78gev photon was not emitted before the onset of the observed high - energy emission .",
    "one could choose either the onset time of the emission above @xmath0mev or above @xmath24gev , which correspond to @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "gev photon was emitted near our choices for @xmath82 , together with lower energy photons , as can be expected for any reasonable emission spectrum .",
    "this is evident from the lack of accumulation of photons along the _ solid _ curves in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:090510-liv ] , at least for the first 3 @xmath73 values , and provides support for these choices of @xmath73 ( i.e. that they can indeed serve as upper limits on a liv induced energy dispersion ) . ]    the 5@xmath83 and 6@xmath83 limits in table  [ tab : liv ] are more speculative , as they rely on the association of an individual high - energy photon with a particular spike in the low - energy light curve , on top of which it arrives . while these associations are not very secure ( the chance probability is roughly @xmath84 ) , they are still most likely , making the corresponding limits interesting , while keeping this big caveat in mind .",
    "the allowed emission time of these two high - energy photons , if these associations are real , is shown by the two thin vertical shaded regions in fig .  [ fig:090510-liv ] . for the @xmath78gev photon",
    "this gives a limit of @xmath85 for either sign of @xmath86 .",
    "the last limit in table  [ tab : liv ] is based on a different method , which is complementary and constrains both signs of @xmath86 .",
    "it relies on the highly variable high - energy light curve , with sharp narrow spikes , which would be smeared out if there was too much energy dispersion ( of either sign ) .",
    "we have used the discan method  @xcite to search for linear energy dispersion within the lat data ( the actual energy range of the photons used was @xmath87mev to @xmath78gev )  gev or @xmath24gev . ] during the most intense emission interval ( 0.5@xmath9@xmath91.45@xmath9s ) .",
    "this approach extracts dispersion information from all detected lat photons and does not involve binning in time or energy . using this method we obtained a robust lower limit of @xmath88 ( at the 99% confidence level ) .",
    "our most conservative limits ( the first and last limits in table  [ tab : liv ] ) rely on very different and largely independent analysis , yet still give a very similar limit : @xmath89 .",
    "this lends considerable support to this result , and makes it more robust and secure than for each of the methods separately .",
    ".lower - limits on the quantum gravity ( qg ) mass scale associated with a possible linear ( @xmath90 ) variation of the speed of light with photon energy , that we can place from the lack of time delay ( of sign @xmath86 ) in the arrival of high - energy photons relative to low - energy photons , from our observations of grb  090510 ( from  @xcite ) . [ tab : liv ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the grb prompt emission typically has very large isotropic equivalent luminosities ( @xmath91 ) , significant short time scale variability , and typical photon energies @xmath92 ( in the source cosmological frame ) .",
    "this would result in a huge optical depth to pair production ( @xmath93 ) at the source , which would thermalize the spectrum and thus be at odds with the observed non - thermal spectrum , unless the emitting material was moving toward us relativistically , with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath94 .",
    "this `` compactness '' argument has been used to derive lower - limits , @xmath95 , on the value of @xmath96 , which were typically @xmath97 and in some cases as high as a few hundred ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the photons that provided the opacity for these limits were well above the observed energy range , so there was no direct evidence that they actually existed in the first place .    with fermi",
    ", however , we adopt a more conservative approach of relying only on photons within the observed energy range . under this approach ,",
    "@xmath98 where @xmath99 is the highest observed photon energy , so that setting a large @xmath95 requires observing sufficiently high - energy photons .",
    "the main uncertainty in deriving @xmath95 is usually the exact choice for the variability time , @xmath100 .",
    "other uncertainties arise from those on the spectral fit parameters , or on the degree of space - time overlap between the high - energy photon and lower energy target photons , in cases where there is more than one spectral component without conclusive temporal correlation between their respective light curves .",
    "finally , the fact that our limits rely on a single high - energy photon also induces an uncertainty , as it might still escape from an optical depth of up to a few .",
    "however , in most cases the second or third highest - energy photons help to relax the affect this has on @xmath95 ( as the probability that multiple photons escape from @xmath101 rapidly decreases with the number of photons ) .",
    "thus , we have derived reasonably conservative @xmath95 values for 3 of the brightest lat grbs : @xmath102 for grb  080916c  @xcite , @xmath103 for grb  090510  @xcite , and @xmath104 for grb  090902b  @xcite .",
    "this shows that short grbs ( such as 090510 ) are as highly relativistic as long grbs ( such as 080916c or 090902b ) , which was questioned before the launch of fermi  @xcite . since our highest values of @xmath95",
    "are derived for the brightest lat grbs , they are susceptible to strong selection effects",
    ". it might be that grbs with higher @xmath96 tend to be brighter in the lat energy range ( e.g. by avoiding intrinsic pair production  @xcite ) .",
    "a delayed onset of the high - energy emission ( @xmath2100@xmath1mev ) relative to the low - energy emission ( @xmath105mev ) appears to be a very common feature in lat grbs .",
    "it clearly appears in all 4 of the particularly bright lat grbs , while in dimmer lat grbs it is often inconclusive due to poor photon statistics near the onset time .",
    "the time delay , @xmath106 , appears to scale with the duration of the grb ( @xmath107 several seconds in the long grbs 080916c and 090902b , while @xmath108s in the short grbs 090510 and 081024b , though with a smaller significance for the latter ) .",
    "only 3 lat grbs so far have shown clear ( @xmath25@xmath109 ) evidence for a distinct spectral component . however , these grbs are the 3 brightest in the lat , while the next brightest grb in the lat ( 080916c ) showed a hint for an excess at high energies .",
    "this suggests that such a distinct high - energy spectral component is probably very common , but we can clearly detect it with high significance only in particularly bright lat grbs , since a large number of lat photons is needed in order to detect it with @xmath25@xmath109 significance .",
    "the distinct spectral component is usually well fit by a hard power - law that dominates at high energies . in grb",
    "090902b a single power - law component dominates over the usual band component both at high energies ( above @xmath110mev ) and low energies ( below @xmath111kev ; see _ lower panel _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : long - vs - short ] ) .",
    "there is also marginal evidence that the high - energy power - law component in grb  090510 , which dominates above @xmath110mev , might also appear at the lowest energies ( below a few tens of kev ) .",
    "both the delayed onset and distinct spectral component relate to and may help elucidate the uncertain prompt grb emission mechanism .",
    "the main two competing classes of models are leptonic and hadronic origin .    * leptonic : * the high - energy spectral component might be inverse - compton emission , and in particular synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) if the usual band component is synchrotron . in this case",
    ", however , it may be hard to produce the observed @xmath112 , where @xmath100 is the width of individual spikes in the lightcurve ( @xmath113 might occur due to the build - up of the seed synchrotron photon field in the emitting region over the dynamical time ) .",
    "moreover , the gradual increase in the photon index @xmath114 of the distinct high - energy power - law spectral component is not naturally expected in such a model , and the fact that it is different than the band low - energy photon index as well as the excess flux ( above the band component ) at low energies are hard to account for in this type of model .    *",
    "hadronic : * @xmath106 might be identified with the acceleration time , @xmath115 , of protons ( or heavier ions ) to very high energies ( at which they loose much of their energy on a dynamical time , e.g. via proton synchrotron  @xcite , in order to have a reasonable radiative efficiency ) .",
    "if the observed high - energy emission ( and in particular the distinct high - energy spectral component ) also involves pair cascades ( e.g. inverse - compton emission by secondary @xmath116 pairs  @xcite produced in cascades initiated by photo - hadronic interactions ) then it might take some additional time for such cascades to develop . such an origin for @xmath106 ( @xmath117 )",
    ", however , requires the high - energy emission to originate from the same physical region over times @xmath118 , and implies high - energy emission rise and variability times @xmath119 , due to the stochastic nature of the acceleration process ( while @xmath120 is usually observed ) .",
    "the gradual increase in @xmath114 is not naturally expected in hadronic models , though it might be mimicked by a time - evolution of a high - energy band - like spectral component  @xcite .",
    "for grb  090510 a hadronic model requires a total isotropic equivalent energy @xmath121 times larger than that observed in gamma - rays  @xcite , which may pose a serious challenge for the progenitor of this short grb .",
    "the excess flux at low energies that is observed in grb  090902b ( and the hint for such an excess in grb  090510 ) may be naturally explain in this type of model by synchrotron emission from secondary pairs  @xcite .",
    "altogether , hadronic models seem to fare somewhat better , however both leptonic and hadronic models still face many challenges , and do not yet naturally account for all of the fermi observations .",
    "in most lat grbs the high - energy ( @xmath2100@xmath1mev ) emission lasts significantly longer than the low - energy ( @xmath105mev ) emission . while the high - energy emission usually shows significant variability during the prompt ( low - energy ) emission phase , in some cases showing temporal correlation with the low - energy emission , the longer lived emission is typically temporally smooth and consistent with a power - law flux decay ( of @xmath122 ) with a lat photon index corresponding to a roughly flat @xmath123 .",
    "it is most natural to interpret the prompt high - energy emission as the high - energy counterpart of the prompt soft gamma - ray emission , from the same emission region , especially when there is temporal correlation between the low and high - energy light curves , and sometimes even from the same spectral component ( as appears to be the case for grb  080916c ) .",
    "however , when there is no such temporal correlation , an origin from a different emission region is possible .",
    "the longer lived smooth power - law decay phase is more naturally attributed to the high - energy afterglow , from the forward shock that is driven into the external medium .",
    "an afterglow origin has been suggested in some cases for the whole lat emission  @xcite , including during the prompt soft gamma - ray emission stage , however in this scenario it is generally hard to explain the sharp spikes in the lat lightcurve during the prompt phase .",
    "it is easier to test the origin of this long lived high - energy emission when there is good multi - wavelength coverage of the early afterglow emission ( e.g. , in x - ray and/or optical ) , such as for grb  090510  @xcite .",
    "producing particularly high - energy photons is challenging for a synchrotron origin , both during the prompt emission  @xcite , and even more so during the afterglow ( e.g.  @xcite ) , as it requires a very high bulk lorentz factor and upstream magnetic field , in addition to a very efficient shock acceleration ( e.g. a @xmath124gev photon observed in grb  090902b after @xmath125s , well after the end of the prompt emission  @xcite , requires @xmath126 ) .",
