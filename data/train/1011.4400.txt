    "in the study of adsorption - desorption ( deposition - evaporation ) processes on a planar surface , the edwards - wilkinson @xcite and the kardar - parisi - zhang @xcite growth models have been extensively researched .",

    "recently the raise and peel model ( rpm ) was introduced @xcite . in this one parameter",
    "dependent model , adsorption is local but desorption is not ( the interface is `` peeled '' ) .",
    "when the parameter is changed in the critical domain , @xmath0 changes too , varying from @xmath1 to zero .",
    "the model was extended to contain sources at the boundaries @xcite and defects @xcite .",
    "the rpm was also used to check various estimators in information theory @xcite .    if one fixes the value of the parameter such that @xmath1 , the model has magical properties .",
    "the system has a space - time symmetry ( conformal invariance ) and the stationary state probability distribution function ( pdf ) has fascinating combinatorial properties @xcite being related to a two - dimensional equilibrium system @xcite .",
    "this is also the single case where the system is integrable .    in the present paper",
    "we will consider the rpm at the conformal invariant point only .",
    "with a few exceptions , it is not yet known which characteristics of the stationary state are universal and the time - dependent properties of the interface are by and large , uncharted territory .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce a new model , dependent on a parameter @xmath2 , which is in the same universality class as the rpm .",
    "this implies that in the finite - size scaling limit the models coincide for the whole range of values of @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that in this limit , the single difference between the models is the value of the sound velocity @xmath3 which is a function of @xmath2 . since the models are not local , finding models belonging to the same universality class is not an obvious matter .    for reasons which will be apparent later on , we call the new model the peak adjusted raise and peel model ( parpm ) , it is presented in section 2 . except for @xmath4 ,",
    "the rates are dependent on the system - size @xmath5 and on @xmath2 .",
    "the parpm for @xmath6 is not integrable and therefore all the results we have are based on monte carlo simulations on large lattices . in the stationary states , the pdf s have no magic properties .    in section 3",
    "we show that , in the finite - size scaling limit the density of contact points is independent of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this observation is important since for @xmath4 one recovers the rpm and for this case , the density of contact points is known exactly ( this knowledge is based on conformal field theory and combinatorics @xcite ) .",
    "we next examine the time dependence of the average number of clusters for various lattices sizes using the family - vicsek analysis @xcite .",
    "the large time behavior of the density is given by a few levels of the spectrum of the evolution operator ( hamiltonian ) and it is well understood for @xmath4 .",
    "we have observed that by a rescaling of the time , which implies changing the sound velocity @xmath3 as a function of @xmath2 , one obtains the same finite - size scaling function of @xmath7 for all values of @xmath2 ( @xmath5 is the system size ) . in order to check that this picture is correct ,",
    "we have done a finite - size scaling analysis of the spectrum of the hamiltonians and found the same values for @xmath3 as the ones determined in obtaining the family - vicsek function .",

    "is an adsorbing state and conformal invariance is lost .",
    "we believe that the results mentioned above are a clear demonstration that the parpm is in the same universality class as the rpm .",
    "these observations opens the possibility to look for other universal quantities than those already considered in the study of the rpm .",
    "since the models are not local , there is no recipe to find them .",
    "we will show that the average density of sites where desorption does not take place is universal : for large values of @xmath5 , its value is independent of @xmath2 .",
