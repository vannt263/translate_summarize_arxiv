    "kitaev toric code model opens a new direction to study the storage of quantum information and design of quantum computation in a topological protected way @xcite .",
    "the objects carrying the quantum information are so - called anyons , the quasiparticles obeying exotic statistics in two - dimensional condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "the first realistic anyonic quasiparticle is laughlin quasiparticle in @xmath0 fractional quantum hall system @xcite and possibly obey @xmath1 fractional statistics @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the researches for anyons mainly focus on the following aspects : non - abelian fractional quantum hall states @xcite ; topological insulator carrying majorana fermionic edge mode @xcite ; and kitaev lattice spin models , i.e. , the toric code model @xcite , levin - wen model @xcite and honeycomb - lattice spin model @xcite .    the abelian anyons in kitaev models have currently attracted many research interests . experimentally exciting , manipulating and detecting abelian anyons",
    "have been suggested or tried for the toric code model @xcite and for the insulating phase of kitaev honeycomb - lattice model @xcite .",
    "the explicit presentation of nonabelian anyons has also been studied @xcite .",
    "the realization of kitaev toric code and honeycomb lattice models is not easy because of the unconventional interaction between spins . in this paper",
    ", we propose a toric honeycomb lattice model which is equivalent to kitaev toric code but in a more symmetric way .",
    "it was known that the insulator phase of kitaev honeycomb lattice model is equivalent to kitaev toric code model @xcite according to a perturbation analysis .",
    "instead of such a complicated way , in this paper , we directly use the group element of @xmath2 gauge group in kitaev honeycomb model to construct our model hamiltonian .",
    "there are two independent operators to represent the @xmath2 group .",
    "they play roles of the stabilizer operators of the toric code .",
    "thus , we find that our model is equivalent to kitaev toric code model but the hamiltonian is more symmetric .",
    "all the eigenstates can be known because the model is exactly solvable .",
    "the low - lying excitations contain a closed subset in which the excitations obey the mutual semionic statistics .",
    "furthermore , we show that this toric honeycomb lattice model can be mapped to a decoupled ising chain array in a square lattice under a special external field . the latter has been studied before by one of us with li @xcite and the low - lying excitations of that model also obey mutual semionic statistics .",
    "however , the decoupled ising chain array has much higher degrees of freedom of the ground states and low - lying excitations than those of the honeycomb model .",
    "this makes the difficulty to peel out a given set of the anyons @xcite . carefully checking the mapping",
    ", one sees that this is caused by the lost of the couplings between the chains when a jordan - wigner transformation is used in the mapping .",
    "the source of the lost of the coupling arises possibly from the unproper treatment of the periodic boundary condition in jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "an additional boundary hamiltonian should be added @xcite , which is a bit complicated . focussing only on the low - lying sector",
    ", we can introduce vertical ising ferromagnetic couplings in two given vertical chains ( the boundary chains ) to approximate the boundary couplings .",
    "after modifying the totally decoupled chain array model to the boundary coupled chain array model , the degeneracy of the ground states becomes consistent with the honeycomb model and so are the low - lyings excitations . therefore , this boundary coupled ising chain array model is equivalent to the toric honeycomb model in the low - lying sector .",

    "this spin model is invariant in @xmath15 permutation .",
    "this model is exactly soluble : the ground states are given by the states with @xmath16 for all plaquette and the excited states are of at one plaquette having @xmath17 or @xmath18 , which will be studied later in details .",
    "the ground states are of the form @xmath19 is an arbitrary reference state , e.g. , @xmath20 with each ` @xmath21 ' denoting the eigenvalue 1 of @xmath22 .",
    "the number of @xmath23 is @xmath24 , the dimensions of the whole hilbert space @xmath25 .",
    "the above construction of the ground states means the ground state space @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the group generated by all independent @xmath13 and @xmath28 . on the torus , due to the periodic boundary condition , there are two constraints @xmath29 for the generators , which means @xmath30 . therefore , according to the general theory given by gottesman @xcite , the degeneracy of the ground states are @xmath31 , which is exactly the same as that of the kitaev toric code model @xcite .",
    "one can even make a more intuitional proof similar to what kitaev did @xcite . for a plaquette @xmath6 , one defines @xmath32 to be @xmath33 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 ; @xmath39 to be @xmath33 for @xmath34 , @xmath37 for @xmath36 , and @xmath35 for @xmath38 . for any closed loop ,",
    "one can define two different operators @xmath40 for any trivial loop on the torus , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are identical to the identity .",

    "the exact form of @xmath139 is complicated .",
    "instead , we can use an approximation to deal with the periodic boundary condition so that the low - lying excitation sector is correct .",
    "we introduce ising ferromagnetic boundary couplings to the system , i.e. , for the two vertical red lines in fig.[fig : fig.3 ] , we approximate the boundary effect from the jordan - wigner transformation through a boundary coupling hamiltonian @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 label two vertical red lines in fig.[fig : fig.3 ] and @xmath143 mean the sum is over corresponding vertical lines .",
    "we assume @xmath144 is much larger than @xmath145 , the energy scale of the low - lying excitations , so that the opposite nearest neighbor spins along a given boundary line do not create additional low - lying excitations .",
    "clearly , this kind of couplings make all odd / even chains have the same states in a given ground state .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy of the ground states is the same as two decoupled ising chains , i.e. , 4 . and",
    "couplings will not change the ground state . due to the periodic boundary condition",
    ", low - lying excitations will appear in pairs .",
    "thus , as long as excitations do not cross the vertical boundary lines , excitations are low - lying .",
    "the statistics of excitations in square lattice are the same as those in honeycomb lattice , see @xcite .",
    "we have constructed a toric honeycomb model and proved that it is equivalent to kitaev toric code model in square lattice .",
