    "blazars are radio sources that have prominent synchrotron cores",
    ". their broad - band spectra are smooth and flat from the radio up to the infrared / optical bands ( or beyond that ) , the emission is variable , sometimes on time - scales as short as minutes to hours , and is often polarised ( see e.g. urry & padovani ( 1995 ) and kollgaard ( 1994 ) for reviews ) .",
    "the blazar population comprises bl lacs and flat spectrum radio quasars , which are , respectively , featureless optical spectrum objects and strong broad emission line objects .",
    "it is believed that the continuum radiation of blazars is predominantly non - thermal emission from a relativistic jet pointing to the observer at a small angle to the line of sight , as proposed by blandford & rees ( 1978 ) . traditionally , apart from the radio - loudness , core - jet morphology and flatness of the broad - band spectrum , an object is only classified as a bl lac if it has a strong non - thermal optical component relative to the starlight and weak emission lines .",
    "the emission lines are commonly quantified by the equivalent width ( ew ) of the brightest line and the strength of the non - thermal optical component is measured through the relative depression of the continuum at 4000   , the 4000    break contrast , c. the usual limits adopted are ew  @xmath2  5    and c  @xmath2  0.25 ( e.g. stocke et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "these are empirical limits , based on the properties of a relatively small number of objects .",
    "results from newer samples have been showing that the 4000    break contrast distribution of bl lacs and other `` non - bl lac '' objects does not reveal a clear bi - modality ( e.g. march et al . , 1996 ; hereinafter m96 , laurent - muehleisen et al . , 1998 ;",
    "caccianiga et al .",
    ", 1999 ; rector et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "as first noted by m96 the traditional classification of a bl lac is almost certainly too restrictive , and an `` expanded '' definition that includes objects with c @xmath2 0.4 and objects with larger emission line equivalent widths was proposed .",
    "more recently , landt et al . (",
    "2004 ) have suggested that there is a natural separation between weak- and strong - lined sources in the [ oiii ] 5007  /[oii ] 3727    plane which clarifies blazar classification schemes .",
    "their weak - lined class contains the majority of classical bl lacs while the strong - lined class has the majority of the broad - line blazars .",
    "their approach is interesting but might be complicated by the fact that they include a wide range of luminosities in their sample . in this paper",
    "we look at continuum spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of objects in a sample with a restricted range of luminosities .",
    "+ the seds of blazars are distinctive by having a 2-hump shape , in units of @xmath3 f@xmath4 vs. @xmath3 ( f@xmath4 the flux density and @xmath3 the frequency ) .",
    "in general , the lower frequency hump is attributed to synchrotron radiation and the second hump to inverse compton scattering by the synchrotron electrons .",
    "the first hump is characterised by the frequency @xmath5 at which the synchrotron component begins to decline .",
    "this frequency is directly related to a break in the synchrotron electron energy spectrum in the jet .",
    "some bl lacs ( and flat spectrum radio quasars ) show the first energy peak in the infrared / optical wavelength range and these are often labelled low frequency peaked bl lacs ( lbls ) .",
    "on the other hand there are those that show the first energy peak in the euv region , the high frequency peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) .",
    "lbls are mainly found in the radio - selected samples , whereas the hbls are mainly found in the x - ray selected samples . although some authors disagreed ( e.g. polatidis , 1989 ) , for some time it was thought that there was a bi - modal lbl - hbl population .",
    "however , the discovery of more bl lacs , mainly in the x - ray / radio surveys , has been showing that there is a continuous distribution of the peak frequencies ( e.g. perlman et al . 1998 , 2001 ) and that the apparent dichotomy was due to selection effects ( e.g. padovani et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and references therein ) .",
    "it is now widely accepted that bl lacs have a broad @xmath5 distribution , spanning @xmath6 5 orders of magnitude in frequency ( 10@xmath7  @xmath8  @xmath2  10@xmath9  hz ) , the extremes being populated by lbls and hbls . +",
    "a potentially very important result has been pointed out by fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2002 ) . they found a sequence involving the frequency",
    "at which the peak of the non - thermal emission occurs and the radio luminosity ; the synchrotron peak position and the radio luminosity appear anti - correlated in the sense that lower peak positions are associated with the more luminous radio emitters .",
    "donato et al . ( 2001 ) , based on x - ray spectra of blazars , also found the same anti - correlation .",
    "this recognition of a blazar spectral sequence appears to be an important breakthrough in our understanding and it is therefore vital to check if the result holds when a wider range of parameter space is explored .",
    "+ much of the research on blazars has been based on very bright and relatively small samples , either selected on the radio band , e.g. `` 1 jy sample '' ( stickel et al . , 1991 ) or in the x - ray band , e.g. emss ( gioia et al . , 1990 ; stocke et al . , 1991 ; maccacaro et al . ,",
    "1994 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the knowledge on these objects has been built on the properties of the most powerful ones , which may not be representative of the population as a whole .",
    "it would be , therefore , very useful to have a new radio - selected sample of relatively low radio - luminosity objects in order to investigate further the luminosity - peak frequency sequence . in particular ,",
    "if the trend in the data is telling us about the physical properties of the blazars , and not about selection effects , the low - luminosity objects should be found to have relatively high synchrotron peak frequencies .",
    "such an investigation is particularly timely as recent results point to a more complicated scenario , in which objects from deep surveys do not follow the anti - correlation trend ( padovani et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "+ in order to investigate this issue and others we have been analysing a low - luminosity radio - selected sample , the 200  mjy sample ( antn et al , 2004 , hereinafter a04 ; m96 ) .",
    "producing statistically well - defined samples of blazars is difficult since traditionally it has relied on the detection of an optical non - thermal component in the sed .",
    "this introduces strong luminosity - dependent selection effects ( browne & march , 1993 ; march & browne , 1995 , landt et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; rector & stocke , 2001 ) and many analyses of blazar population statistics can be suspect for this reason .",
    "therefore we have been exploring an approach to sample selection focusing on the low frequency ( radio , mm and sub - mm ) properties , particularly the possession of milliarcsecond vlbi core - jet structure of the type commonly found in superluminal radio sources . with our 200 mjy core - jet sample",
    "we have a set of objects well suited to extend our knowledge of the seds of blazar - like objects . here",
    "we address the following questions :    * what is the range of synchrotron peak frequencies amongst the low - luminosity radio selected objects ? do these objects follow the luminosity peak frequency sequence ? * how does the peak frequency influence the classification of the objects ? * are there any selection effects influencing the luminosity peak frequency sequence ?",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec - seds ]",
    "we present a summary of the properties of the sources discussed here , as well as the analysis of their seds . in section  [ sec - peak ]",
    "we discuss the relation between the sed type and the optical classification of the objects .",

    "that study has revealed a subset of objects with uniform radio / mm properties , flat broadband spectra , some being classified as bl lac objects but some having different optical classifications , as follows :    1 .   from the analysis of the seds of the 200 mjy sample as a whole ( a04 ) , it became clear that there was a subset of objects which had , at least at wavelengths down to the sub - mm , flat broadband spectra ( in units of flux density vs frequency ) before steepening , and they have been classified as broken - power - law type objects ( * bpl * ) in table 1 .",
    "there are a few objects showing an infrared bump that we interpreted as dust emission , and they are listed in table 1 as * bpl+ib * ( broken - power - law + infrared bump ) .",

    "this ensures that we are dealing with a set of objects in which the radio emission is mainly from the active nucleus and not from compact lobes , as would be the case with sources with cso - like radio structures .",
    "in addition we note that the possession of core - jet vlbi radio structures is in general a good circumstantial evidence that we are dealing with emission from relativistic jets .",
    "for example , britzen et al .",
    "( britzen , personal communication ) have made extensive vlbi observations of a complete sample of 297 flat spectrum radio sources ( cjf : taylor et al .",
    "1996 ) and they find that @xmath690% of those cjf sources with core jet structures show superluminal motion .",

    "more interesting is the fact that the t@xmath20 of bl lacs and of the other objects are very similar .",

    "have seds which fall into the category bpl .",
    "more interesting is the fact that objects other than bl lacs look similar to bl lacs up to relatively high frequencies . to investigate this further , the seds of the objects in table  [ tabela ] were model fitted to estimate the peak frequency , and look for any statistical difference between bl lacs and non - bl lac objects .",
    "we assumed the fossati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) model , that consists of a power - law , to represent the low frequencies , plus a parabola for the higher frequencies .",
    "the model differentiates two frequencies : up to a certain frequency the radiation is taken to be optically thick and it is represented by the power law , then the emission becomes optically thin and it is represented by the parabolic function with the maximum occurring at a frequency @xmath5 .",
    "more complex and physically based models have been considered by others ( e.g. padovani et al 2003 ) .",
    "but , as in our case the aim is to compare the peak frequencies amongst objects , it is sufficient to use a convenient analytical function for the modelling .",
    "the same protocol was used for all the objects .",
    "the flux densities were k - corrected , assuming the spectral indices from sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and in the computation of the luminosities a redshift of 0.3 was assumed if there was no redshift available for the object . when it was clear that the near infrared / optical emission was predominantly starlight ( not agn emission ) , the data points were ignored during the fitting process .",
    "we note that the optical data point is our estimate of the non - thermal emission , based on the 4000    break contrast as described in a04 .",
    "figure  [ figuras ] shows the seds of four objects , each representing a different optical class : 1055 + 567 is a bl lac , 0651 + 428 is a bl lac candidate , 0125 + 487 is a seyfert-1 like object with blazar characteristics and 1241 + 735 is a peg .",
    "black area represent the @xmath5 distribution of known bl lac objects , width=302 ]        the seds were analysed in the manner described in the previous section and the distribution of the synchrotron peak frequencies ( @xmath5 ) is shown in figure  [ peaks ] . we draw attention to the fact that the @xmath5 are widely and fairly _ continuously _ distributed from @xmath6 10@xmath28 to 10@xmath29 hz with the well - known bl lacs ( c  @xmath2  0.25 & ew  @xmath2  5   ) and other objects ( c  @xmath27  0.25 & ew  @xmath27  5   ) occupying overlapping regions .",
    "the @xmath5 distribution strongly points to the conclusion that we are dealing with a single group of objects drawn from the same population ( otherwise one would not expect a continuous distribution ) , containing a wide spread of non - thermal cut - offs , ranging over 4 orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "+ in the lower frequency tail of the distribution , we suggest that we are seeing the red end of the blazar sequence and , if one wished to maintain the tradition of labelling objects by where their spectral peaks lie , one might call the objects with @xmath5 lying at frequencies smaller than the near - infrared as very low - frequency - peaked bl lacs , or vlbls .",
    "we do not , however , believe it helpful to make this distinction and wish , rather , to emphasise the similarities . these objects : + @xmath26",
    "all have flat broad - band spectra up to frequencies of @xmath6100  ghz or higher .",
    "+ @xmath26 all have radio structures that consist of compact vlbi cores plus jets .",
    "+ how do the values of @xmath5 relate to the traditional optical classifications of bl lacs , seyfert - like objects and pegs ?",
    "it is of course of interest that not all the objects listed in table  [ tabela ] , and that we would like to label as blazars , meet the usual `` bl lac '' criteria . in figure  [ cpeak ] the values of @xmath5 are plotted against the 4000    break contrasts .",
    "as expected , the @xmath5 distributions of bl lacs are different from those of seyfert - like , bl lac candidates and peg objects ; bl lacs have @xmath5 in the near - infrared / optical / x - ray bands and the rest of objects have their @xmath5 located mainly between the long and near infrared bands . of course it should be no surprise that the strength of the synchrotron component in the optical band ( which is the basis of normal bl lac classification ) is dependent on the frequency at which the synchrotron emission begins to decline .",
    "note that the importance of this effect on traditional classifications decreases with increasing non - thermal luminosity . in the case of powerful objects ,",
    "their non - thermal optical component is strong enough to compete with the starlight ( from the host galaxy ) and to fill the 4000    break , even in the case of a relatively low @xmath5 .",
    "that is , when there is a wide range of peak frequencies , as we believe is the case , it can lead to a selection - induced anti - correlation between @xmath5 and luminosity ( see below ) .",
    "this implies that a very low luminosity bl lac is only recognised as such if it has a very high frequency peak , whereas for a high luminosity object recognition is possible for a wide range of peak frequencies .",
    "a crucial question is whether or not the systematic shift of the average synchrotron peak frequency with luminosity , pointed out by fossati et al . ( 1998 ) and donato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is confirmed for our 200  mjy sample of low - luminosity radio - selected objects .",
    "this spectral sequence is important because , if true , it represents a great empirical simplification which is backed by an elegant physical explanation in terms of different inverse compton losses occurring in the jet due to ambient photon densities which vary with object luminosity ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ; georganopoulos et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "+ unfortunately there are also selection effects which might give rise to a spurious correlation of the form that is observed ( see also perlman et al .",
    "this is because the result is based on all available blazar seds taken from a whole range of samples with different selection criteria .",
    "one of the possible selection effects ",
    "i.e. that recognition of bl lacs with low cut of frequencies is more difficult at low luminosities than high luminosities  was already pointed out in section  [ sec - peak ] .",
    "another possible selection effect is that in the samples analysed by fossati et al .",
    ", the lower luminosity objects are mainly represented by the x - ray selected objects ( e.g. the slew sample ) and therefore likely to be mainly hbl - type . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher luminosity objects represented by the 1 jy and 2 jy samples , are mainly radio - selected objects , and therefore the majority are of lbl - type .",
    "thus a correlation of the form observed could arise from the type of objects available for analysis .",
    "+ the 200 mjy being a radio - selected sample , but of relatively low average radio - luminosity , occupies a critical range of parameter space and is thus well suited to enable us to check the reality of the radio - luminosity / spectral sequence : if they follow the expected luminosity trend , they should have high peak frequencies . to ensure that we are comparing like with like",
    ", the seds of the slew and 1 jy objects listed in fossati et al ( 1998 ) were re - fitted in an identical manner to the 200 mjy objects ( section  [ sec - sedfitting ] ) . figure  [ lum5nupeak ] presents the peak frequencies against radio luminosities at 5 ghz for the 1 jy , slew and 200 mjy objects ( the latter plotted in different symbols depending on the optical classification ) .",
    "the 200 mjy objects fill a region of intermediate radio luminosity relative to the 1 jy and slew objects , showing objects with low radio luminosities and low peak frequencies .",
    "this is best shown in figure  [ lumpeak ] that presents the peak frequency distributions of the objects and their respective radio luminosities at 5 ghz .",
    "it is clear that the distributions of _ radio luminosities _ in the slew survey and the 200  mjy samples are very similar .",
    "thus , on the basis of the proposed spectral sequence , we would expect the 200 mjy objects and slew objects to have the same distribution of _ peak frequencies_. it is , however , evident from figure  [ lumpeak ] that they do not ( k - s test rejects this hypothesis at a significance level of @xmath30 ) .",
    "the 200  mjy peak frequency distribution is more similar to that of the 1  jy sample , suggesting that the method of selection ( i.e. radio or x - ray ) has more influence on the peak frequency distribution than does the intrinsic luminosity .",
    "+ we suggest that when there is a population with a broad distribution of spectral shapes , a low frequency band of selection biases the samples to objects that are stronger at low frequencies and a high frequency band of selection biases the samples to objects that are strong at high frequencies .",
    "sources strong at low frequencies tend to have low peak frequencies and visa versa . in radio astronomical parlance ,",
    "selecting at high frequencies is the way to select flat spectrum sources and selecting at low frequencies produces lots of steep spectrum sources ( kellermann et al . , 1968 ) . also , as argued in section  [ sec - peak ] , there is a bias against recognising as traditional bl lacs , low luminosity objects with synchrotron peak frequencies in the infrared and lower frequencies , which also acts to reinforce the fossati et al . correlation .",
    "how valid is our approach to defining blazar samples ?",
    "the advantage of ignoring the optical emission is that it is much less subject than other methods to luminosity - dependent selection effects , something that is quite important when comparing the statistical properties of samples with a range of luminosities .",
    "+ perhaps the most controversial thing we have done is to include objects with seyfert - like spectra in our 200 mjy sub - sample .",
    "we point out , however , that three of the eight seyfert - like objects , namely 0125 + 487 , 1646 + 466 and 2116 + 81 , are well - established blazars ( jackson & march , 1999 ; perlman et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "if we exclude the remaining five objects ( see figure  [ lumpeaknosy ] ) it is still clear that the peak frequency distribution for the 200  mjy sample objects is still much more like that of the 1jy sample of high luminosity objects than that of the lower luminosity slew survey objects ( k - s test rejects the hypothesis that 200 mjy and slew samples have similar peak frequency distributions at a significance level of @xmath31 ) .",
    "+ we thus believe that we have shown that amongst low - luminosity radio sources there are nuclear synchrotron emitters with peaks in their seds falling at lower frequencies than have been found before .",
    "these objects may not meet the criteria usually required for classification as a blazar but we see no good physical reason why they should be denied that status and argue that our `` non - optical '' method of sample selection has significant advantages over the tradition methods .",
    "based on the assumption that these are really blazars , we have looked at where these objects fit on the sequence of blazar seds with luminosity investigated by fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ghisellini et al .",
    "we find that they occupy part of the luminosity / peak frequency plane hitherto almost empty and thus much weaken the significance of the correlation found by fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ghisellini et al .",
    "our results are consistent with the results from padovani et al .",
    "we compare peak frequency distributions of samples selected in diverse ways and argue that the distribution of peak frequencies for each sample has much more to do with the initial sample selection frequency than it has to do with intrinsic agn luminosity .",
