    "massive stars , with o or early b spectral types on the main sequence are , for the most part , born in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "initial `` clumps '' made up of dense molecular gas along with appreciable concentrations of dust comprise the birth material .",
    "once a luminous star becomes sufficiently hot , substantial lyman continuum luminosity is produced and the surrounding hydrogen is rapidly ionized into a strmgren sphere . during these birth phases ,",
    "the medium surrounding the stellar embryo is sufficiently dense ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) that the hii region radius is a small fraction of a parsec , @xmath80.010.1 pc .",
    "this ultra - compact hii ( uchii ) region ( e.g. wood & churchwell 1989 ) is detectable at cm wavelengths .",
    "it is surrounded by a natal dust `` cocoon '' , which is somewhat opaque to ( roughly ) near infrared ( nir ) and shorter wavelength radiation and so is heated by the star .",
    "these cocoons are observable as thermal sources in the mid infrared ( mir ) and at longer wavelengths as has been shown previously ( e.g. crowther & conti 2003 - hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "further evolution of the individual stellar birth cocoons proceeds as follows : the intense radiation of the star ( likely aided by its wind ) dissipates and evacuates the dust that gradually expands .",
    "as it does so , its optical depth diminishes and the ob type exciting star becomes revealed .",
    "the ucii region also becomes larger , forming a compact hii and finally a normal hii region .    for ob stars formed in a cluster ,",
    "additional physics comes into play as the environment also contains gas and dust .",
    "each luminous star affects this cluster material by heating the dust and gradually dissipating it by the strong stellar radiation fields and winds .",
    "in addition , the lyman continuum luminosity from a large ensemble of ob stars can ionize a substantial volume of space , resulting in an observable giant hii ( ghii ) region . in a few cases ( e.g. w49a ) individual uch ii regions can contribute to the overall ionization of the cluster environment ( e.g. conti & blum 2002 , alves & homeier 2003 ) .",
    "we would expect that a ghii region would be ionized by ob stars which are , for the most part , already beyond the uchii stage ( e.g. blum et al .",
    "we are interested in measuring parameters of the dust content of the ob star clusters since that lifetime is much longer than that of the individual natal dust cocoons surrounding the ob star members , but may still be shorter than the stellar evolution time scale .",
    "we began this study by considering those galactic ( ghii ) objects that emit a lyman continuum luminosity ",
    "n(lyc )  of at least @xmath9 photons@xmath10 , thus excited by more than ten o7v * stars ( o star equivalents - vacca 1994 ) . such regions ought to represent the main locations of massive stars in our galaxy . following the technique of smith et al . ( 1978 ) we re - evaluate the census of galactic ghii regions based on modern radio surveys ( e.g. condon et al.1989 ) and kinematical distances ( russeil 2003 ) , that is , they are derived from a galactic rotation model and hi line velocity measurements .",
    "this ghii sample has formed the basis of an ongoing systematic nir imaging and spectroscopic study of the stellar content of these objects ( e.g. blum 2003 and   4 ) .",
    "it is already clear from our published and unpublished nir imaging that many of the radio selected ghii sample contain identified ob star clusters .",
    "a primary objective of this paper is to study the newly selected ghii regions in the mir with @xmath0 at a higher ( circular ) spatial resolution than was possible with @xmath1 .",
    "central wavelengths of 12@xmath4 m , 25@xmath4 m , 60@xmath4 m and 100@xmath4 m have rectangular spatial resolutions of 30@xmath11 , 30@xmath11 , 1@xmath12 and 2@xmath12 , respectively . ]",
    "kraemer et al . ( 2003 ) present studies of nearby star forming regions ( orion , pleiades etc . ) with @xmath0 , whilst _ spitzer _ has already began producing yet higher spatial resolution mir maps ( churchwell et al . 2004 ; whitney et al . 2004 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the present work extends previous studies to a complete census of the most luminous radio selected , massive star forming regions . in many cases",
    "the spatial morphology is quite complicated , indicating the presence of more than one dust emission source , so previous hii region studies making use of the @xmath1 point source catalogue ( e.g. codella et al .",
    "1994 ) may be inappropriate due to the widely variable spatial scale of galactic ghii regions ( chan & fich 1995 ) .",
    "we will make measurements of the various ir fluxes through the @xmath1 filters using the sky survey atlas ( issa ) .",
    "we would like to compare measurements of the thermal emission from the integrated cluster dust with the radio free - free emission from the hot stars within .",
    "the former depends upon the far uv ( fuv ) luminosity of the ensemble of ob stars in the cluster(s ) and the extent and temperature distribution of the dust within it .",
    "the latter depends upon the integrated extreme uv ( euv ) luminosity of these same stars . in our paper",
    "i we have proposed that these same measurements fit reasonably well a simple spherical model for the ( mostly single star excited ) uchii regions .",
    "we will revisit this relationship below .",
    "it is well known that uchii regions have spectral energy distributions ( seds ) which are not fit by a single temperature black body ( e.g. wolfire & churchwell 1994 ) .",
    "rather the observed seds of uchii regions are broad with a peak near 100@xmath4 m , corresponding to a dust temperature of 30 deg k. however , other hotter material is also present .",
    "what is the situation for the dust in those ob star clusters with dust ? here",
    "mir and far - ir ( fir ) photometry will help constrain the seds of dusty ob clusters .",
    "in section  [ sam ] we present our revised ghii catalogue , which is complemented by the largest ghii regions in the magellanic clouds . the procedure for analysing the observations",
    "is contained in section  [ obs ] .",
    "we discuss in section  [ morph ] the individual mir images of this set of data which are presented in the appendix . in section  [ flux ]",
    "we discuss the similarities and differences among the objects using different ir flux ratios ( colours ) .",
    "we compare the ghii / hii colours with those of the uchii regions from paper i. we also consider the relationships between the ir luminosity and the radio fluxes for all the data .",
    "a discussion is given in section  [ summ ] .",
    "in this paper we look at a planopy of massive star birth environments in multiple excited ghii regions . at an initial stage of this study",
    "we based our sample on forty ghii regions of blum ( 2003 ) .",
    "this sample was directly drawn from smith et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , which was based on low spatial resolution 6 cm radio fluxes taken from reifenstein et al .",
    "( 1970 ) and wilson et al .",
    "( 1970 ) , except that a revised solar galactocentric distance of 8kpc was adopted ( reid 1993 ) .    in preference to these older compilations , we used the higher spatial resolution 6 cm study of hii regions by kuchar & clark ( 1997 ) , based on the nrao 91 m condon et al .",
    "( 1989 ) survey plus the atnf 64 m ( parkes ) condon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) survey .",
    "these were used in preference to ( admittedly yet higher ) spatial resolution radio data such as the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) at 1.4ghz , since we required all sky coverage at an optically thin radio frequency , for which 5ghz is superior to 1.4ghz . in two cases ( m17 and w43 )",
    "we used 6 cm radio fluxes from downes et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , since these were missing from the kuchar & clark ( 1997 ) compilation , presumably due to saturation effects .    from our initial list of candidate ghii regions based solely upon russeil ( 2003 )",
    "radio derived kinematical distances , we first revised distances for several well - known regions based on more recent radio studies by araya et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , watson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , sewilo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and corbel & eikenberry ( 2004 ) .",
    "this revision led several candidates to be revised to the near ( rather than far ) distance , demoting them to normal hii regions , including g34.255 + 0.144 ( araya et al .",
    "2002 ) , g10.6170.384 and g10.6640.467 ( corbel & eikenberry 2004 ) .",
    "subsequently , further candidates were rejected on the basis of spatial location in the milky way inferred from the kinematical distance assumed .",
    "two were rejected since their galactocentric distance was predicted to exceed 12kpc ( based on a solar galactocentric distance of 8kpc , reid 1993 ) , namely g7.472 + 0.060 and g173.599 + 2.798 . in addition , two further candidates were omitted since their ` far ' kinematical distance implied a distance of z@xmath13300pc from the galactic plane , namely g351.6131.270 and g351.6951.165 .",
    "it is likely that these two sources lie on the near side of the galactic centre , such that they are normal hii regions .",
    "two other candidates lying @xmath14200 pc from the galactic plane _ are _ included ( g70.3001.600 , g79.293 + 1.296 ) since they lie outside the solar circle , and their distances are probably genuine .    finally , ten further candidates , some associated with the w49 and w51 complexes , g2.9010.006 , g13.381 + 0.071 , g26.1030.069 , g289.760 - 1.155 , g338.086 + 0.007 , g342.3820.044 were also dropped since their 21@xmath4 m fluxes were less than 5% of that for the mean ghii region , after being adjusted to a uniform distance in all cases .",
    "finally , we also omitted the galactic centre cluster ( g359.9510.037 ) since we considered a study of its ir / radio properties might be affected by unusual conditions relative to normal star forming regions .",
    "table 1 gives the listing of the remaining 56 ghii regions as derived from radio measurements .",
    "figure  [ galaxy ] indicates the galactic distribution of ghii regions in galaxy , as viewed from above , projected onto the disk , and along the disk of the milky way .",
    "this is analogous to fig .  11 from georgelin & georgelin ( 1976 ) , albeit based solely on radio selected ghii regions .",
    "from the original smith et al .",
    "( 1978 ) sample , there was a lack of radio ghii regions on the far side of the galaxy .",
    "it is apparent that more contemporary distance estimates has removed this puzzle .",
    "the spiral arm structure is not immediately apparent ( see russeil 2003 ) , although any interpretations must be treated with caution as the distances have been determined kinematically .",
    "the handful of objects so far studied photometrically and spectroscopically in the nir ( e.g. see blum et al .",
    "2002 ) have spectroscopic parallaxes which move them closer to the sun , two substantially .",
    "the appearance of this figure might change dramatically once more of the ob star clusters exciting the ghii have been identified and their distances determined by this method . with the exception of several sources at the galactic centre itself , there is only one region apparently within a galactocentric distance of 4kpc , namely g347.611 + 0.204 .",

    "individual ghii and hii region images were obtained from the @xmath0 image server at ipac http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/ @xmath0/. for our purposes , we sought integrated mir fluxes in janskys for comparison with radio fluxes . consequently , the @xmath0 point source catalogue was not appropriate , given the need to use variable apertures for these extended sources . extracted mir fluxes of each ghii region are obtained from integrated fluxes using a circular aperture of diameter @xmath18 , as derived from @xmath0 21@xmath4 m images ( see table 2 ) , with a mean diameter of @xmath18(21@xmath4m)=4 arcmin ( 40 pixels ) .",
    "identical aperture diameters were adopted for the 12@xmath4 m flux measurements . in all cases",
    "the apertures were centred on the radio positions , with the exception of a few spatially large nearby regions such as m17 , for which an aperture of @xmath18= 9@xmath12 , centred at g15.0620.693 was required to accommodate the entire ghii region .",
    "thin annular rings were taken in all cases , in order to set the background level , taking care to avoid mir sources in these annuli .",

    "division by the filter bandwidth then provides fluxes in w m@xmath27 hz@xmath10 (= 10@xmath32 jy ) .",

    "the ghii regions reveal a compact dust source with associated extended halo ( e.g. g345.5550.043 ) that resemble the morphology of regions with luminous nir clusters such as w31 .",
    "in other cases bright , extended dust sources are observed ( e.g. g2.303 + 0.243 ) , reminiscent of rcw49 .",

    "the dust emission of the ghii regions arises primarily from the interstellar material within or close to the exciting star clusters .",
    "some emission may also have an origin from individual circumstellar dust cocoons surrounding uchii regions ( or hot cores ) within the clusters . as with stellar magnitudes ubv or jhk",
    ", it will be instructive to plot analogous colors for the mir or fir fluxes . in figure 2(a ) we make ir colour - colour plots using the log flux ratio ( colour ) 100@xmath4m/60@xmath4 m versus 60@xmath4m/25@xmath4 m for the uchii of paper i ( open ) and for the ghii regions of this paper ( filled ) .",
    "similar plots for a smaller number of normal hii regions were presented by chan & fich ( 1995 ) .",

    "we see that such criteria will also pick out ghii regions .",

    ", we used the black body distributions convolved with the iras filter profiles ( based on beichman et al .",
    "1988 ) . in each plot",
    "there is a main body of points with outliers , the most extreme of which are usually those with complicated morphology . in both cases",
    "we see that on average the 60/25@xmath4 m colours lead to higher temperatures than the 100/60@xmath4 m colours .",
    "this is a quantitative way to demonstrate that the sed of the dust of uchii , ghii and hii s do not follow simple black body laws .",
    "note that the main body of points of the uchii are at slightly cooler temperatures but there is plenty of overlap .    using the msx data we have also made an analogous plot of 21/12@xmath4 m versus the iras 60/25@xmath4 m colors , which is presented in fig .",
    "the inferred temperatures were still higher with these shorter wavelength @xmath0 colours , although we acknowledge that the 12@xmath4 m fluxes are influenced by the silicate absorption feature which affects this wavelength .",
    "the observed scatter for the complex morphology uchii regions ( open triangles ) was much greater than for the simple uchii regions ( open squares ) and ghii regions ( filled circles ) .",
    "the radio emission of hii regions arises from the integrated lyman continuum luminosity ( euv ) of the hot star content of the cluster(s ) within .",
    "what is measured is the free - free emission of the ionized hydrogen and/or the strength of high level recombination hydrogen emission lines , typically obtained at @xmath41 wavelengths .",
    "these can be converted to the number of lyman continuum photons ( nlyc ) producing the emission using well known physical relationships , _ if the distance is known_. what one wishes to obtain is the nlyc photons emitted by the stars , so that one may infer their stellar properties .",
    "the observed nlyc could be affected by leakage of photons from the region without ionizing the material , a so - called density bounded nebulosity .",
    "some emitted photons might also be absorbed by the dust within the nebulae . in both cases ,",
    "the _ observed _ nlyc would be smaller than the _ emitted _ nlyc and one would underestimate the hot star content .",
    "how important are these effects for ghii regions ?",
    "uchii regions have very dense cocoons overlaying the ionized hydrogen but also tend to have extended hydrogen emission halos , suggesting that their inner environments are density bounded and/or clumping may play a role ( ignace & churchwell 2003 ) and lyc photons are escaping . whether clusters are density bounded is a longstanding problem that is not fully resolved , but does not need to be settled here",
    ". it would be important to resolve this issue were we to try to infer the stellar content of our clusters from the counted nlyc photons alone .",
    "we now turn to the role of the dust .",
    "its emission is related to the quantity and quality of material present , and the heating by the hot stars in the clusters .",
    "their emitted radiation peaks in the far uv beyond the lyman limit ; the thermal dust emission peaks near 100@xmath4 m .",
    "we have estimated the total ir integrated luminosity ( l@xmath42 ) of the dust using a standard relation ( e.g. chan & fich 1995 ) , with a minor modification to include the more reliable @xmath0 mir fluxes , via : @xmath43 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the dust is optically thick to stellar radiation , the l@xmath42 is a good estimate of the l@xmath44 . with optically thin dust ,",
    "stellar radiation escapes to space and is not available to heat the material and the lir will underestimate the total luminosity l@xmath44 .    in fig .  3 , we plot the observed l@xmath42 inferred from @xmath0 and @xmath34 , versus log n(lyc ) , which are both distant dependent .",
    "this _ ratio _ is distance independent but strongly spectral type dependent ( e.g. , churchwell 2002 ) .",
    "( in paper i , we made an analogous plot but used the 100@xmath4 m luminosity for the ordinate .",
    "that relationship is similar to that shown here . )",
    "the uchii are to the right at lower log n(lyc ) ; the ghii to the left .",
    "hii regions would fill the space immediately to the right of the ghii .",

    "similar results regarding lyman continuum ionizing photons are obtained with alternative wm - basic models ( smith et al .",
    "whilst the majority of the uchii regions lie between the cluster and single star predictions , the ghii regions actually lie below the ( extrapolated ) single star predictions  their ir luminosity is a factor of a few too low versus the cluster predictions .",
    "what is going on here ?",
    "we assert that the problem is that the models assume _ all _ the stellar radiation is absorbed by the dust , which is optically thick , thus l@xmath42",
    "= l@xmath44 .",
    "it could be that some of the uchii regions , which lie close to , or just above , their model predictions , are optically thick",
    ". but the clusters are _",
    "not_.    what are we to make of the large number of uchii regions between the single star and cluster predictions ?",
    "the most reasonable explanation is that these objects contain extra stars which contribute to the l@xmath42 but not so much to the n(lyc ) numbers .",
    "they behave , therefore , as miniclusters .",
    "this explanation was also given by lumsden et al .",
    "but there are still a dozen or so uchii above the cluster predictions .",
    "this can not be an optical depth effect as smaller values would push the l@xmath42 lower .",
    "it is possible that some of these sources have either dust absorption of the lyc photons and/or they are density bounded thus they would be moved to the left . indeed",
    ", even some of the uchii regions located between the model predictions could have these problems .",
    "note that a couple of uchii regions are below the single star predictions",
    ". these might not be optically thick .",
    "let us now turn to understanding the placement of the ghii regions in fig 3 .",
    "there is , curiously , less scatter in the vertical dispersion than for the uchii regions ( one would have expected more scatter given the larger number of free parameters for the clusters ) .",
    "we can assert that those clusters along the top edge of the relationship are on average dustier , or have a higher optical depth , than those along the lower boundary .",
    "the vertical or horizontal scatter is a factor of a few .",
    "while we may be miscounting the n(lyc ) emitted by the stars which would move them to the left , we suspect that the optical depth effect in the dust is the more important variable here .",
    "included among the lower boundary group is ngc  346 , which contains evolved o type stars , thus is somewhat older than the others .",
    "the vertical range of the clusters of fig .  3 at a given n(lyc ) could then be mostly an age effect as the dust is gradually being dissipated and the optical depth decreasing .",
    "the upper edge of the cluster distribution is a factor of 2 or so below the model predictions .",
    "this gives an estimate of the overall dust optical depth to stellar radiation , which would be of order @xmath45=0.7 .",
    "we have carried out a complete census of 6 cm selected hii regions , for which 56 giant hii regions are identified , based in part on mid and far - ir fluxes from @xmath0 and @xmath1 . of course , the radio selected ghii catalogue presented here is not complete .",
    "in addition , there are several clusters close to the centre of the galaxy with ionizing fluxes in excess of 10@xmath46 s@xmath10 .",
    "these include the arches ( serabyn et al . 1998 ) and quintuplet ( figer et al .",
    "1999 ) clusters .",
    "in addition , older massive clusters that have already lost the bulk of their associated gas are also omitted ( e.g. westerlund 1 : clark & negueruela 2002 ) .",
    "we present 21@xmath4 m images of all giant hii regions using @xmath0 .",
    "this wavelength is sampling the thermal emission from the dust in the vicinity of these ob clusters , material left over from the birth of these objects .",
    "the spatial morphology of most of the dust emission is complex ; many sources are double or multiple , suggesting several common sites of recent star formation . extended diffuse dust emission is also common , in contrast to our analogous study of uchii regions ( paper  i ) where such features were rare . in the few cases in which an uchii region is found within a larger ghii region ,",
    "the dust from the former entity dominates the emission ; it is only a small part of the measured nlyc .",
    "we have also measured mir and fir emission from the @xmath34 archive of these same objects .",
    "we used the msx satellite data to interpret the fir @xmath1 fluxes which were obtained at a lower spatial resolution , particularly the longest wavelength one at 100@xmath4 m .",
    "these wavelengths sample an appreciable fraction of the dust emission and can be used to infer properties of its sed and total luminosity .",
    "tables 1 and 2 provide detailed information about each source , with relevant flux measurements .",
    "a careful examination of the tables indicates that 75% of the sources show a 100@xmath4 m flux larger than that at 60@xmath4 m , thus the peak of the dust emission sed for the cluster excited regions is near the former wavelength or beyond .",
    "this was already known to be the case for uchii regions but is a new result for the ghii regions .    in the colour - colour diagrams we plot the @xmath0 and @xmath1 flux ratios for the uchii regions of paper  i and the luminous ghii of this paper .",
    "there is a main body of points in each plot , with outliers , and while the uchii are a bit redder there is considerable overlap in the colours with the cluster objects . under an over simplified assumption that each colour can be represented by a black body temperature",
    ", we also show these numbers on the plots .",
    "the temperatures inferred from the colour are mostly lower for the longer wavelength colours in both cases .",
    "ir colour - colour selection criteria for uchii regions will also pick up ghii and hii sources .",
    "we infer the fir luminosity by weighting and combining the ir fluxes using the distances in the tables ; the n(lyc ) is also listed there . in fig .",
    "3 we show the relationship between these two measures . with some scatter",
    "we see that as the number of ob stars ( the abscissa ) increases , the dust emission ( ordinate ) does also ( more stars ) .",
    "the uchii points lie , for the most part , between the predictions for single stars and those for small clusters .",
    "some objects lie well above the cluster relationship ; these most likely have some absorption or escape of lyc photons from the nebula ( quite possible if there is significant clumping ( ignace & churchwell 2004 ) . in both cases",
    "the points would move to the left towards the predicted line , sometimes substantially .",
    "we wish to thank martin cohen for help with @xmath0 flux calibration , nick gautier for the calibration of @xmath34 data , tom kuchar for providing the hii region catalogue in digital form , and bob blum for providing us with nir images of nearly all of our sources and invaluable advice on the manuscript .",
