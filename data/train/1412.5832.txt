    "the ir luminescence of bismuth centers discovered in glasses @xcite has been observed in various glasses and crystals . despite active studies of the bismuth - related ir luminescence ( the present state of the art",
    "is reviewed in @xcite ) and successful applications for laser amplification and generation ( see e.g. reviews @xcite and @xcite ) , the origin of the luminescence centers in most systems still remains to be established .",
    "in general , currently a belief is strengthened that certain subvalent bismuth species are responsible for the ir luminescence ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in a few systems",
    "the structure of the luminescence centers is definitively clear , namely , bi@xmath0 subvalent bismuth clusters in @xmath1 crystal , bi@xmath2 dimers in @xmath3 crystal , @xmath4 ions in zeolite  y ( see review @xcite and references within for details )",
    ". models of subvalent bismuth centers as possible source of ir luminescence were suggested for several systems basing on first - principle modeling ( e.g. @xcite and references within ; @xcite ) .",
    "both for understanding the origin of ir luminescence centers and for possible applications , especially in fiber optics and optical communications , bismuthate - silicate and bismuthate - germanate systems are of interest . for many hosts , including and , bi doping",
    "is hindered owing to significant ionic radius of bismuth . however in or glasses appears as glass former and its content is known to vary in wide range ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this shows promise of obtaining glasses with high concentration of the bismuth - related luminescence centers .    in and glasses containing 0.030.05",
    "mol.% and no other dopants , luminescence bands around 1.67 and 1.43  m , respectively , were observed @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we suggested models of corresponding luminescence centers based on results of our first - principle studies .",
    "in binary systems , however , distinctly different luminescence occurs .",
    "the luminescence in the 1.21.3  m range excited at 0.5 , 0.8 and 1.0  m was observed in glasses ( @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite ) , in crystals quenched in n@xmath7 atmosphere @xcite , and in mg- or ca - doped crystals @xcite .",
    "the luminescence in the 1.83  m range was observed in glasses ( @xmath8 ) @xcite , in pure and bi- , mo- , or mg - doped crystals , and in mo - doped crystals @xcite .",
    "annealing glasses in oxidative atmosphere @xcite or adding oxidant ( ceo@xmath7 ) in glass @xcite led to a decrease in the luminescence intensity evidencing convincingly oxygen - deficient character of the luminescence centers . in glasses",
    "@xcite , in glass prepared in alumina crucible @xcite , and in crystals @xcite the 1.21.3  m luminescence band contained a component near 1.1  m characteristic of -based glasses @xcite .",
    "whilst no specific models of the luminescence centers in systems were suggested in the cited papers , the authors mainly held the opinion that such centers are formed by subvalent bismuth .    in all stable and crystals ( sillenites , and , eulytines , and , benitoite , )",
    "bi atoms are known to be threefold coordinated @xcite .",
    "it would be reasonable that bi atoms occur mainly in the same local environment in and glasses as well .",
    "such single threefold coordinated bi atoms in and hosts were studied in our recent work @xcite .",
    "if content is high enough , the groups ( pairs at least ) of threefold coordinated bi atoms bound together by bridging o atoms would occur in and as well .",
    "therefore one might expect that in and glasses there are oxygen - deficient centers ( ) not only typical for and ( namely , o vacancy and twofold coordinated si or ge atoms ) , but as well similar s containing bi atoms ( s ) , namely , , , vacancies and twofold coordinated bi atoms . according to @xcite , in twofold coordinated bi atoms bound by bridging o atoms with si atoms can be considered as @xmath9 centers , while in such bi atoms are unstable .",
    "thus , studying the , , and vacancies as possible in and is of interest .",
    "s of o vacancy type were studied , namely , , and vacancies in and hosts , and and vacancies in and hosts .",
    "the modeling was performed using periodical network models .",
    "@xmath10 supercells of and lattice of @xmath11 quartz structure ( 24 or groups with 72 atoms in total ) were chosen as models of initial perfect network . from two to eight ( )",
    "groups in the supercell were substituted by groups , from one to four .",
    "so the supercell compositions varied from @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) to @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , respectively . using ab  initio molecular dynamics ( md )",
    "the system formed by supercells was heated to temperature as high as 1200  k ( enough for both and @xcite ) , maintained at this temperature until the equilibrium atom velocities distribution was reached and then cooled to 300  k. periodical models of and networks based on final supercell configurations were applied to study the s. each vacancy , , , or , was formed by a removal of a proper o atom .",
    "when necessary , fourfold coordinated al center , , was formed substituting al atom for si or ge atom and increasing the total number of electrons in the supercell by one .",
    "equilibrium configurations of the s were found by a subsequent car - parrinello md and complete optimization of the supercell parameters and atomic positions by the gradient method .",
    "all these calculations were performed using quantum espresso package in the plane wave basis in generalized gradient approximation of density functional theory using ultra - soft projector augmented - wave pseudopotentials and perdew  burke  ernzerhof functional .",
    "configurations of the s obtained by this means then were used to calculate the absorption spectra .",
    "the calculations were performed with code by bethe - salpeter equation method based on all - electron full - potential linearized augmented - plane wave approach in the local spin density approximation with perdew - wang - ceperley - alder functional .",
    "spin - orbit interaction essential for bi - containing systems was taken into account .",
    "scissor correction was used to calculate transition energies .",
    "the scissor value was calculated using modified becke - johnson exchange - correlation potential .",
    "further details and corresponding references may be found in @xcite .    on the contrary to the centers modeled in @xcite ,",
    "the stokes shift corresponding to a transition between the first excited state and the ground one turns out to be large in all the , , and centers .",
    "so in such centers the luminescence wavelengths were estimated only roughly .",
    "+    calculated configurations of and centers in are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : centers ] .",
    "configurations of the corresponding centers in , , and are similar .",
    "distance in center is 3.08   in and 3.12   in , distance in center is found to be 2.89   in and 2.95   in , distance in center in and is 3.03   and 2.94   , respectively . by comparison , calculated distance between ge ( si ) atoms in single ( ) vacancy in ( )",
    "is found to be 2.58   ( 2.44   ) , and in bi@xmath7 dimer the distance is known to be 2.66   @xcite .",
    "so relatively weak covalent bond occurs between bi and ge ( si ) atoms in ( ) vacancy and between two bi atoms in vacancy .",
    "regardless of the presence of al atom , the angles in and vacancies are close to the right angle , and the angle in vacancy and the one in vacancy are close to the tetrahedral angle .",
    "the analysis of electronic density has shown bi to be nearly divalent in all the s under study . however",
    "the electronic structure of these s differs essentially from that of the divalent bi centers ( twofold coordinated bi atoms ) studied in @xcite . in particular , in the latters the excited states energies are found to exceed @xmath16  @xmath17 ( absorption wavelengths @xmath18  m ) @xcite , while in all , , and centers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] ) there are the low - lying excited states with the energy of @xmath19  @xmath17 ( long - wave transitions in the @xmath20  m range ) .",
    "the origin of states and transitions in the , , and centers may be understood in a simple model considering twofold coordinated bi atom as the divalent bi center @xcite .",
    "the ground state and the first excited state of @xmath9 ion are known to be and ( 20788  @xmath17 ) , respectively @xcite . in a crystal field",
    "two sublevels , and , of the first excited state are formed , giving rise to the @xmath21 and @xmath21 absorption bands and the @xmath21 luminescence band .",
    "the dangling bonds of twofold coordinated bi atom and threefold coordinated ge ( si ) atom in ( ) center or the dangling bonds of two twofold coordinated bi atoms in center form bonding ( doubly occupied ) and anti - bonding ( unoccupied ) states .",
    "the corresponding levels calculated in the tight - binding model @xcite without spin - orbit interaction for geometrical parameters of the centers , obtained in our modeling , are shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : models ] and as ( i ) and ( ii ) schemes .",
    "strong intra - atomic spin - orbit interaction in @xmath9 ion ( the coupling constant is known to be @xmath22  @xmath17 @xcite ) results in a splitting of both levels in accordance with bi atom 6p states amplitudes in the wave functions ( ( iii ) schemes in figs .",
    "[ fig : models ] and ; the values in brackets indicate total angular momentum of the @xmath9 ion states which provide bi 6p contribution to the wave function of the level ) . and finally , level splitting in a crystal field together with madelung s shift result in final sets of the electronic states ( ( iv ) schemes in figs .",
    "[ fig : models ] and according to the results of our modeling ) .",
    "the luminescence owing to transition from the lowest excited state to the ground state corresponds ( regarding the 6p contributions to the wave functions ) to the @xmath21 transition in @xmath9 ion .",
    "however the transition energy turns out to be considerably decreased as a result of the above - described transformation of electronic states .    both covalent ( ii ) and spin - orbit ( iii )",
    "splittings are determined mainly by ( ) distances and mutual orientation of p orbital of bi atom and sp@xmath23 orbital of ge ( si ) atom ( p orbitals of two bi atoms ) .",
    "hence the stokes shift of the luminescence band relative to the absorption band corresponding to transitions between the ground and the first excited states can not be small , as distinct from the monovalent bi centers @xcite .",
    "basing on our calculations , the stokes shift is estimated to be about 300  @xmath17 ( @xmath245% ) for and centers in and centers in , about 1200  @xmath17 ( @xmath2420% ) for the center in , and about 800  @xmath17 ( @xmath2410% ) for center in and center in ( fig .  [",
    "fig : levels ] ) .",
    "if center occurs in the second coordination shell of ge ( si ) atom of the ( ) center , the electronic density is displaced from the vacancy towards the al atom leading to further attenuation of interaction between bi and ge ( si ) atoms . as a result , distance increases , covalent splittings ( ii )",
    "is reduced , bi 6p states contribution to the ground state wave function grows , and spin - orbit splitting ( iv ) increases .",
    "thus , the electronic structure in the vicinity of bi atom in the ( ) center becomes more similar to the electronic structure of twofold coordinated bi atom .",
    "accordingly , the ir transition is displaced to shorter - wave range ( figs .",
    "[ fig : levels ] , and ) .",
    "the formation energy of , , , and vacancies was found to be approximately @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28  ev , respectively ( the formation energy of vacancy is taken here to be zero point ) . suggesting the migration energies of o vacancy between various pairs of atoms to be approximately in the same relations as formation energies of corresponding vacancies",
    ", one can explain the results of @xcite by thermally stimulated migration of o vacancies during glass annealing .",
    "owing to the migration , centers may transform into ones . as a result ,",
    "1.21.3  m luminescence intensity decreases with 1.83  m luminescence increasing .",
    "in conclusion , the results of our modeling of s in and hosts make it reasonable to suggest that the luminescence in the 1.21.3  m range in glasses @xcite and crystals @xcite is caused by center , an o vacancy between bi and ge atoms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bige_geo2 ] ) .",
    "the luminescence in the 1.83  m range observed in annealed glasses @xcite and in and crystal @xcite in the absence of the 1.21.3  m luminescence may be caused by center , an o vacancy between two bi atoms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bibi_geo2 ] ) .",
    "the decrease in intensity of the 1.21.3  m luminescence may be explained by a transformation of centers into ones owing to thermally stimulated migration of o vacancies .",
    "the luminescence near 1.1  m in glasses @xcite and in al - doped crystals @xcite may be caused by center center in the second coordination shell of ge atom .",
    "basing on our modeling , we suppose that in bi - doped and glasses containing @xmath29  mol.% the ir luminescence centers are mainly interstitial bi atoms forming complexes with ( ) vacancies @xcite , while in ( and probably ) glasses containing @xmath30  mol.% the ir luminescence centers are mainly ( ) and vacancies with bi atoms bound in the glass network .",
