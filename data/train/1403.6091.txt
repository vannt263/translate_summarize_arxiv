    "in recent years , there has been a growing interest in materials and solid - state devices with strong spin - orbit interactions .",
    "being a relativistic effect , a spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) reveals itself as a velocity - dependent magnetic field acting on the spin of a particle moving in an electric field .",
    "this enables the polarization and manipulation of carrier spins by electric fields only @xmath0 bypassing design complexities connected with local magnetic fields @xmath0 and is at the heart of current efforts to fuse spintronics with semiconductor technologies @xcite .",
    "spin polarization can be generated by an soi in a variety of ways : impurity scattering ( as in the anomalous @xcite and spin hall effects @xcite ) , via an external electric bias ( `` current - induced spin polarization '' @xcite ) , or , topologically , through spin - momentum locking from strong atomic sois ( as in topological insulators @xcite ) . once a spin - polarized current is produced , it may then be manipulated by exploiting the presence of other sois due to broken symmetries from interfaces , crystal structures , strain , or electric fields .",
    "the generic examples in semiconductor heterostructures are the rashba and dresselhaus sois @xcite .    in many proposals for spintronic devices ,",
    "the interaction between electrons has to be taken into account , hence , it is important to investigate the effects of sois together with electron - electron interactions .",
    "this is particularly so for low - dimensional structures where fluctuations are strongly enhanced due to nonanalyticities in the density of states .",
    "the additional presence of impurities and disorder leads to a complex problem , making non - perturbative theoretical results highly desirable .    in the present work ,",
    "we make a first attempt at this task by studying an exactly solvable model of one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting electrons subject to spin - orbit _ and _ impurity scattering . to allow for an exact solution",
    ", we study a _ minimal model _ where the electrons are spin - polarized , and with the added soi preserving the spin polarization . to simplify further",
    ", we consider a single impurity , and we devise its interaction with the itinerant electrons in such a way as to make the model integrable , amenable to a bethe ansatz approach . while the resulting interaction becomes rather unwieldy @xmath0 as expected from past work on integrable impurities @xcite @xmath0 it could nowadays conceivably be synthesized in a cold atomic gas confined to an optical nanotube @xcite . indeed , the study of synthetic sois in cold atomic gases , mimicking effects from semiconductor physics , is now coming of age @xcite , making this line of research quite timely .",
    "the bethe ansatz solvability of the model allows us to extract its finite - size spectrum , from which the scaling exponents for correlation functions can be obtained via conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "focussing on the large - time dynamical correlations , we find that while the spin - orbit interaction enhances the single - electron green s function , the density correlations get suppressed .",
    "as expected , the presence of the integrable impurity does not influence the scaling exponents at equilibrium : integrability implies that the impurity supports forward scattering only , with the sole effect that a scattered electron picks up a phase shift that can be absorbed in a twisted boundary condition on its wave function .",
    "considering a local quantum quench @xmath0 with the impurity - electron interaction suddenly switched on @xmath0 one might anticipate that the large - time asymptotics maps onto the equilibrium impurity model and therefore is also insensitive to the presence of the impurity . however , this is not the case .",
    "when the electrons are confined to a ring , the scaling exponents for the large - time dynamic bulk correlation exponents _ do _ acquire a dependence on the impurity .",
    "moreover , the quantum quench tends to boost electron density correlations , whereas the spin - orbit interactions does the opposite .",
    "this suggests that the very feature of integrability endows the ground state with a highly quantum entangled structure where also `` far - away '' electrons feel the presence of the impurity .",
    "we conjecture that this feature reflects the way in which an integrable impurity embedded in a one - dimensional ring scatters electrons : all electrons are perfectly transmitted across the impurity site , with the quantum quench releasing a finite - momentum excitation that runs around the ring and influences correlations uniformly in the bulk at large times .",
    "this salient feature may enable the engineering of quantum states in one - dimensional structures with  functional quantum impurities \" which do not corrupt electron transport and , moreover , could be used to promote electron correlations .",
    "we consider a 1d spin - polarized interacting electron system , with the soi coming from an electric field perpendicular to both the spin polarization and the direction of electron propagation .",
    "awaiting future cold atom realizations @xcite , such a setup may be materialized using a quantum wire patterned in a zinc - blende semiconductor quantum well where shear strain gradients emulate an internal electric field @xcite , and with the device put on top of a ferromagnetic insulator to provide for the spin polarization .",
    "we should stress , however , that we do not aspire to model a particular experiment .",
    "instead , the main reason for the design of our model is to obtain a sufficiently simple but nontrivial theory that allows for an exact solution .",
    "thus , we take as a hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the creation ( destruction ) operator for an electron at the @xmath5th site , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the hopping amplitude in the absence of an soi , @xmath8 is the soi amplitude , and @xmath9 is the interaction strength between electrons at neighboring sites ( see fig .",

    "the phase factor can be removed completely from the theory for the case of an open chain , and transferred to twisted boundary conditions for a closed chain .",
    "we will consider the case @xmath14 , where we can use the parametrization @xmath15 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for this case the hamiltonian can be mapped with the help of the jordan - wigner transformation onto that of an `` easy - plane '' antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain with dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , with @xmath16 playing the role of an external magnetic field @xcite .     and",

    "let us now introduce an impurity by adding a lattice site , labeled @xmath19 and located , say , between sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the chain . to maintain integrability of the theory",
    ", the coupling of the impurity site to the host has to be chosen judiciously . using a template from ref .   and",

    "it is worth pointing out that the structure of the impurity hamiltonian becomes much simpler for the case of an open chain with the impurity situated at its edge : for that case we have @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 labels the last site in the chain , with @xmath35 the length of the chain and @xmath36 the lattice spacing ) . also note that the commutator term in eq .",
    "( [ himp ] ) , while necessary for integrability , is irrelevant from the point of view of the renormalization group and can be neglected in the long - wavelength limit @xcite .",
    "it can be checked that the gauge transformation , which removes the phase shift @xmath37 from the hamiltonian for open boundary conditions and transfers it to twisted boundary conditions for the closed chain , can be applied also when the impurity interaction in ( [ himp ] ) is included .",
    "while the impurity hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ himp ] ) breaks lattice translational invariance , single - particle backscattering ( reflection ) is not possible .",
    "this is a necessity for the applicability of the ba method to which we now turn . for the case of a periodic chain , with the soi encoded by twisted boundary conditions ,",
    "we obtain the ba equations ( cf . the corresponding equations for the homogeneous chain without soi @xcite ) @xmath38 which determine the quantum numbers @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 the number of electrons ) that parametrize the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues @xmath41 of the total hamiltonian @xmath42 . here",

    "less trivial is the property that the ba equations in ( [ baen ] ) are blind to the position of the impurity @xcite .",
    "this feature , signaling that the impurity is non - reflecting , appears also in the related problem of  mobile \" integrable impurities @xcite . as we shall see",
    ", it has dramatic consequences for correlation functions and observables .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 , determining the coupling of the impurity to the host , introduces a low - energy scale @xmath47 , analogous to a kondo temperature @xcite .",
    "it defines a crossover between a low - energy regime where the impurity site is strongly coupled to the host , and a high - energy regime with the site being `` asymptotically free '' .",
    "importantly , the scale @xmath48 characterizes how the impurity influences the zero - frequency response of the system to an applied electric field : at low temperatures , @xmath49 , one finds that the impurity contribution @xmath50 to the charge stiffness behaves as @xmath51 , while at high temperatures , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , in both cases with corrections @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",

    "note that the ba equations for the paradigmatic kondo and anderson models @xcite also appear to be insensitive to the location of the impurity .",
    "this comes about because these models are originally defined within a radial geometry , with the 1d integrable theory obtained by `` unfolding '' the half - line around the origin , making it chiral and translational invariant .",
    "however , since the origin defines the impurity site , these theories , _ by construction _ , keep track of the location of the impurity .",
    "for example , finite - size corrections to the ba spectrum properly provide information about critical exponents for correlations between points that are far from each other compared to the distance to the impurity , but not in the `` bulk '' where the opposite relation holds .",
