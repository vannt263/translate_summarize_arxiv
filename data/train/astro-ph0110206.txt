    "<S> time - resolved photometry during outburst showed that eclipses became systematically deeper and narrower as the outburst faded . </S>",
    "<S> full - orbit light curves in quiescence showed little evidence of orbital humps or asymmetry of eclipses . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the presence of high  low transitions in quiescence , the overall behavior of outbursts and characteristics of the eclipse profiles suggest that ir com can be best understood as a twin of ht cas , a famous eclipsing su uma - type dwarf nova with a number of peculiarities . </S>"
