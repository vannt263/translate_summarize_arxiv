    "inspired by these results , now we consider quantum state engineering on an ellipse and on a specific lattice in phase space .",
    "we show , by using an efficient numerical optimization method , that the superpositions of a small number of coherent states can approximate certain nonclassical states with a high accuracy . for certain states and",
    "parameter ranges the approximation is better than the corresponding one on a circle or along a line .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we summarize the results on approximation of nonclassical states with coherent - state superpositions on a circle or along a straight line in phase space . in the construction of",
    "squeezed number states by coherent - state superpositions on an ellipse is considered .",
    "we present our results on approximating nonclassical states by coherent - state superpositions on a lattice in .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the results known from the literature related to the construction of nonclassical states by coherent - state superpositions along a straight line and on a circle in phase space .",
    "a systematic method was developed in @xcite for obtaining optimized superpositions from the one - dimensional representation @xcite of the desired state . in this quantum state engineering protocol",
    "a given quantum state @xmath0 is approximated either by an equidistant superposition @xmath1 of coherent states @xmath2 distributed at distances @xmath3 along the real axis of phase space , or by a superposition @xmath4 of coherent states @xmath5 equally distributed on an arc of a circle in phase space with radius @xmath6 . in and @xmath7 is a normalization constant .",
    "the positions of the coherent states in these superpositions are defined by the following equations : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 determine the center of the distribution , @xmath11 is the phase difference between two adjacent coherent states .    in the superpositions in and ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath12 are derived from the continuous distribution functions of the one - dimensional coherent - state representations of the state @xmath0 along the real axis @xmath13 and on a circle @xmath14 respectively , by the following expressions @xmath15 the optimal values of the distances @xmath3 and phase differences @xmath11 can be determined numerically by minimizing the misfit parameter @xmath16 the quantity @xmath17 is the fidelity between the approximating coherent - state superposition @xmath18 and the target quantum state @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , the described method for deriving the approximating coherent - state superpositions can only be used if a well - behaved one - dimensional coherent - state representation of the quantum state @xmath0 exists .",
    "for example , the condition of the existence of an appropriate weight function @xmath19 on a circle with radius @xmath6 reads @xcite @xmath20 where the numbers @xmath21 are the coefficients in the photon number expansion @xmath22 we note that for a state with an infinite number of fock - state coefficients not fulfilling an approximate weight function @xmath23 can be derived by appropriate truncation of the expansion of . as a consequence , discrete coherent - state superpositions approximating a nonclassical state",
    "can always be constructed on a circle in phase space .    using this procedure , approximating discrete coherent - state superpositions",
    "were determined in @xcite for various nonclassical states , including displaced squeezed number states , squeezed coherent states , binomial states , hermite - polynomial states , and amplitude squeezed states . in @xcite coherent - state superpositions approximating phase - optimized states on the real axis of phase space were derived by a different numerical method .",
    "this method varies not only the coefficients but also the positions of the coherent states in phase space .",
    "though there is no one - dimensional straight - line coherent - state representation known for these states , the numerically obtained superpositions of high accuracy consist of a few coherent states distributed nearly equidistantly .",
    "this experience can be explained by the properties of the quantum interference between the constituent coherent states .",
    "the interference phenomenon arises typically at a certain range of distance between coherent states . in view of this",
    ", the choice of the equidistant states in the superpositions and seems to be reasonable .",
    "we note that the accuracy of the approximation can be generally increased by increasing the number of constituent states in the superpositions .    from these results",
    "one can conclude that any state can be approximated by discrete coherent - state superpositions . even expecting a given accuracy , different superpositions of various geometries can approximate the same nonclassical state .",
    "coherent state superpositions along a straight line and on a circle have special importance because such superpositions can be generated experimentally in various physical systems @xcite .",
    "in general , small number of constituent states are required if the geometry of their positions fits well to the state to be approximated .",
    "for example , states exhibiting circular symmetry in the wigner function such as photon number states or amplitude squeezed states can be effectively approximated by superpositions on a circle .",
    "the optimal value of the radius of the circle fits to the value of the photon number @xcite when the constituent coherent states in the superposition are located under the central part of the wigner function of the target state . on the other hand , effective approximation of quadrature squeezed states can be realized by superpositions along a line .",
    "these facts motivate our considerations of coherent - state superpositions on an ellipse for approximating squeezed number states .",
    "elliptical states has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "these states can be defined as coherent - state superpositions on an ellipse in phase space @xmath24 where @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are arbitrary real numbers . here",

    "nonclassical properties of such states were analyzed only for states with constant coefficients @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "here we consider the construction of quantum states via elliptical states .",
    "inspired by the considerations in the previous section , we choose displaced squeezed number states for demonstrating the idea of approximating quantum states by discrete coherent - state superpositions on an ellipse .    displaced squeezed states",
    "are defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the displacement operator @xmath32 while @xmath33 is the squeezing operator @xmath34 in the above definitions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the annihilation and creation operators , respectively , @xmath37 is the amount of displacement in phase space , and @xmath38 is the complex squeezing parameter .",

    "we have chosen to use a genetic algorithm  @xcite for solving the optimization problem , as its applicability is quite general and we found it effective in the present case . in order to eliminate the uncertainty of the method due to its stochastic nature",
    ", we have performed multiple runs and we chose the parameter set for which the value of the misfit parameter was minimal .",
    "besides , at a given accuracy , various solutions with slightly different parameters can be found for a given target state .",
    "this degeneracy of the optimum can be foreseen from the general properties of the discrete coherent - state superposition described in the last paragraph of .    in tables",
    "[ tab : ell1]-[tab : ell4 ] we present our results on approximating displaced squeezed number states on an ellipse with 12 coherent states for various values of the photon number , the squeezing parameter and the amount of displacement .",
    "we show the misfit @xmath49 defined in and the ellipse parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 introduced in corresponding to the optimum . for comparison",
    ", the tables also show the misfit @xmath52 and the optimal distance @xmath53 for approximating displaced squeezed number states along the real axis of phase space with 12 equidistant coherent states .",
    "we note that we determined the coefficients @xmath54 and the optimal distances @xmath53 of the constituent coherent states in the line superpositions by using the same genetic algorithm .",
