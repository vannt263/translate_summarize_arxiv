    "pulsar radio emission beam has been widely attempted to interpret in terms of emission in purely dipolar magnetic field .",

    "consider a magnetic dipole situated at the origin with magnetic axis ( @xmath2 ) inclined by @xmath3 with respect to the rotation axis @xmath4 and rotated by @xmath5 around @xmath6 let @xmath7 be the line of sight , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the line of sight impact parameter .    in a relativistic flow ,",
    "the emitted radiation is beamed in the direction of field line tangent @xmath10 , so at any instant the observed radiation comes from a spot in the magnetosphere where the tangent vector points in the direction @xmath11 of observer . for receiving such radiation the semi opening angle of emission beam @xmath12 must be approximately equal to the opening angle of field lines @xmath13 therefore , the magnetic _ colatitude _ @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 next , the magnetic _ azimuth _ @xmath16 of the emission point can be obtained by finding @xmath17 which is parallel to @xmath18 @xmath19 for @xmath20 on leading side the maximum value for @xmath21 allowed by the viewing geometry is @xmath22 which in turn allows to find the maximum pulse window @xmath23 where @xmath5 is the pulse phase at which @xmath21 approaches @xmath24 using @xmath25 and @xmath26 for psr  b0329 + 54 , we find @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29    pulsar radio emission is generally believed to be coherent curvature radiation by secondary pair plasma streaming along the dipolar magnetic field lines .",
    "the curvature emission peaks at the characteristic frequency ( e.g. , eq .  45 , ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) .",
    "for a given frequency and a lorentz factor @xmath30 we can estimate the radius of curvature @xmath31 , which in tern allows to find the field line constant .",

    "1a ) of radiation at 325 mhz and 606 mhz , respectively . on the other hand by accepting the emission heights derived from the aberration - retardation phase shift , we estimated @xmath1 and @xmath31 expected : @xmath33 @xmath34 for 325 mhz emission , and @xmath35 @xmath36 for 606 mhz .",
