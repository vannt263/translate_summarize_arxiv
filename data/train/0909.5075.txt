    "one can view quantum mechanics as an extension of the classical probability calculus , allowing for random variables that are not simultaneously measurable . in order to gain a clearer understanding of quantum theory from this perspective , it is useful to contrast it with various ( factitious ) alternatives that are neither classical nor quantum .",
    "the best known example of such a  foil \" probabilistic theory is probably the theory of  non - local boxes \" @xcite ; but in fact , there is a standard mathematical framework for such theories , going back to the work of mackey in the 1950s @xcite . working in this framework , one can show that many phenomena commonly regarded as characteristically quantum  no - cloning and no - broadcasting theorems @xcite , the trade - off between state disturbance and measurement @xcite , and the existence and basic properties of entangled states @xcite  are actually quite generic features of all non - classical probabilistic theories satisfying a basic  non - signaling \" constraint .",
    "other quantum phenomena , such as the possibility of teleportation @xcite or remote steering of ensembles @xcite , are more special ( and in some sense , more _ classical _ ) , but can still be seen to arise outside the boundaries of quantum theory .    one might hope to find some reasonably short list of probabilistic or information - theoretic phenomena that more cleanly separate quantum theory from other possible non - signaling theories . in a recent paper @xcite , pawlowski _ et al . _",
    "take a step in this direction by showing that any non - signaling correlation violating the tsirelson bound also violates a qualitative information - theoretic principle they call _ information causality _ ( ic ) .",
    "in essence , this prohibits a form of  multiplexing \" in which one party ( bob ) gains the ability to access a total of more than @xmath6 bits of information held by another party ( alice ) , on the basis of an @xmath6-bit message from alice , plus some shared non - signaling bipartite state .",
    "it is also established in @xcite that quantum mechanics  and hence , also classical probability theory ",
    "satisfies this ic constraint .    in establishing that quantum mechanics satisfies ic , pawlowski _ et al .",
    "_ make use only of standard formal properties of the von neumann entropy of joint quantum states .",
    "this raises the obvious question of where their proof breaks down in other contexts ( e.g. , a pr box ) in which ic fails . in order to address this question ,",
    "we develop some of the basic machinery of entropy , conditional entropy and mutual information in a very general probabilistic setting  an independently interesting problem , which seems not to have received much previous attention ( an exception being the paper @xcite of hein ) .",
    "we begin by identifying two notions of entropy , which we call _ measurement _ and _ mixing _ entropy , and which we denote respectively by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is a general probabilistic model . briefly : the measurement entropy of a system is the minimum shannon entropy of any possible measurement thereon , while the mixing entropy is the infimum of the shannon entropies of the various ways of preparing the system s state as a mixture of pure states .",
    "these coincide classically and in quantum theory , but are generally quite different animals .",
    "for example , measurement entropy is always subadditive , and is concave ; mixing entropy is generally neither .",
    "in fact , in appendix a , we show that there are _ always _ violations of concavity of the mixing entropy for any system with a state space that is a non - simplicial polytope .",
    "thus , the condition that mixing and measurement entropies _ do _ coincide , as in quantum mechanics , is a powerful constraint on the structure of a probabilistic theory .",
    "we call theories with this feature _ monoentropic_.    next , we develop an account of joint measurement entropy , conditional entropy , and mutual information for composite systems , and apply this apparatus to the notion of information causality given in @xcite . somewhat surprisingly , it seems that the main issue is not so much one of the strength of non - local correlations , but rather , the failure , of two other , very basic principles .",
    "one is the strong subadditivity , or , equivalently , the condition that the mutual information , defined by @xmath9 , satisfy @xmath10 this holds both classically and in quantum theory , but is violated in very simple non - classical models  even models in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are _ classical _ , so that no issue of non - locality can arise .",
    "another basic principle , equivalent to the holevo bound , is that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is any particular measurement on system @xmath0 .",
    "both strong subadditivity and the holevo bound can be viewed as special cases of an even more basic principle , usually called the _ data processing inequality_. this asserts that , for any systems @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and any reasonable process @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the output system of the process ) .",
    "this is intuitively appealing as a basic physical postulate .    finally , we apply the apparatus just described to the notion of information causality .",
    "we consider in detail the basic example , due to van dam @xcite of an ic - violating composite system , and find that it exhibits a violation of strong subadditivity .",
    "we also establish that , within a very broad class of finite - dimensional _ monoentropic _ theories , strong subadditivity together with the holevo bound entail information causality .",
    "it remains an open question whether all three of these conditions are necessary for this conclusion .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review in some detail the framework of generalized probability theory , largely following @xcite . in section iii , we define , and establish some elementary properties of , measurement and mixing entropy for states of an arbitrary probabilistic model .",
    "section iv discusses composite systems in our framework , and collects some observations about the behavior of joint measurement entropy , and the notion of mutual information based on this .",
    "using this apparatus , we establish in section v that any monoentropic probabilistic theory in which measurement entropy is strongly subadditive and satisfies the holevo bound , is informationally causal in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we also point out that violations of strong subadditivity are possible in theories having no entanglement .",
    "section vi collects some final remarks and open questions .",
    "appendix a contains the proof that mixing entropy is not concave on state spaces that are non - simplicial polytopes .",
    "appendix b establishes some further properties of monoentropic theories , relevant to axiomatic characterizations of quantum theories , and also shows that monoentropicity follows from two other properties , steering and pure conditioning , the physical content of which may be more transparent . finally in appendix",
    "[ appendix : linearization ] we discuss how the framework of this paper relates to the `` convex sets '' framework , and consider analogous definitions of measurement entropy in that context .",
    "as we mentioned above , there is a more or less standard mathematical framework for discussing general probabilistic models , going back at least to the work of mackey in the 1950s , and further developed ( or , in some cases , rediscovered ) in succeeding decades by various authors @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we work in the idiom of @xcite , which we briefly recall .",
    "we characterize a probabilistic model , or , more briefly , a _ system _ , by a pair @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a collection  possibly infinite  of discrete classical experiments or measurements , and @xmath20 is a set of _",
    "states_. we make the following assumptions :    * every experiment in @xmath19 is defined by its set of possible outcomes , so that we may represent @xmath19 , mathematically , as a collection of sets @xmath21 . in the language of @xcite , this is a _ test space _ ; accordingly , we refer to the various sets @xmath22 as _",
    "tests_. * every state is entirely determined by the probabilities it assigns to the outcomes of the various measurements in @xmath19 .",
    "thus , letting @xmath23 denote the total _",
    "outcome space _ of @xmath19 , @xmath20 consists of functions @xmath24 $ ] , with @xmath25 for every set @xmath26 . *",
    "the state space @xmath20 is a convex subset of @xmath27^{x}$ ] ( the functions from @xmath28 to @xmath27 $ ] ) .",
    "hence any statistical mixture of states is a state .    for a given test space @xmath29 ,",
    "one can define the space of _ all _ states on @xmath29 .",
    "this is called the _",
    "maximal _ state space and is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "it is clearly convex .",
    "the _ physical _ state space @xmath20 is necessarily either equal to or a subset of the maximal state space .",
    "this framework , though very simple , is broad enough to accommodate both measure - theoretic classical probability theory and non - commutative probability theory based on von neumann algebras . where @xmath31 is the set of all finite ( respectively , countable ) partitions @xmath32 of a measurable space @xmath33 by non - empty mesurable sets @xmath34 , and where @xmath35 is some closed convex set of probability measures on @xmath12 .",
    "the probabilistic apparatus of states and observables associated with von neumann algebras can be modeled in a similar way . ] in this paper , we shall be interested exclusively in discrete , finite - dimensional systems . accordingly , from this point forward , we make the standing assumptions that ( i ) @xmath29 is _ locally finite _ , meaning that all tests @xmath26 are finite sets , ] and ( ii ) @xmath20 is finite dimensional and closed .",
    "as is easily checked , local finiteness guarantees that the maximal state space @xmath36 is compact ; thus , the closedness of the physical statespace @xmath20 insures that it , too , is compact . of some locally finite test space @xmath19 . ]",
    "it follows that every state can be represented as a finite convex combination , or mixture , of _ pure states _ ,",
    "that is , extreme points of @xmath20 .",
    "we now consider several examples . for us , a _",
    "classical system _ corresponds to a pair @xmath37 where the test space @xmath38 consists of a single measurement and where @xmath39 denotes the entire simplex of probability weights on @xmath12 . in other words , there is just one test and any probability distribution over the outcomes is a possible state .",
    "a quantum system corresponds to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the set of ( unordered ) orthonormal bases on a complex hilbert space @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the set of density operators . with its quadratic form , writing @xmath44 for @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a unit vector on @xmath42 . ]",
    "a simple example that is neither classical nor quantum , and to which we shall refer often , is the  two - bit \" test space @xmath47 , consisting of a pair of two - outcome tests , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : squittestspace ] .",
    "the full state space @xmath48 is isomorphic to the unit square @xmath27 ^ 2 $ ] under the map @xmath49 and is depicted if fig .",
    "[ fig : squit ] .",
    "accordingly , we shall call a system of this form a _",
    "square bit _ or _ squit_. a pr box is a particular entangled state of two squits , as discussed below in section [ subsec : vandam ] .    .",
    "it is depicted using a _ greechie diagram _ , wherein vertices denote outcomes and every smooth line through a set of vertices represents a test . ]    .",
    "the pure state @xmath50 yields the outcome @xmath51 in test @xmath52 and the outcome @xmath53 in @xmath54 , that is , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 yield the pairs of outcomes @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . ]",

    "the von neumann entropy of a state @xmath65 on this system is defined as @xmath66 , where here and elsewhere , logarithms have base @xmath67 .",
    "equivalently , it is the shannon entropy of the coefficients @xmath68 in the spectral decomposition @xmath69 ( where the @xmath70 are @xmath65 s rank - one eigenprojections ) . in effect",
    ", the spectral decomposition privileges a particular convex decomposition of the state , and ( up to phases ) a privileged test in @xmath41 . in our much more general",

    ". it will often be convenient to write @xmath76 as @xmath7 , where context makes clear which state is being considered . for the remainder of this paper we make , and shall make free use of , the assumption that the measurement entropy of a state is actually achieved on some test , i.e. , that @xmath80 for some @xmath26 .",
    "this is the case in quantum theory , and can be shown to hold much more generally , given some rather weak analytic requirements on an abstract model @xmath81  for details , see appendix  [ monoentropic ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath82 if and only if there is a test such that @xmath71 assigns probability @xmath83 to one of its outcomes .",
    "let @xmath71 be a state on @xmath29 .",
    "the _ mixing _ ( or _ preparation _ ) entropy for @xmath71 , denoted @xmath84 , is the infimum of the classical ( shannon ) entropy @xmath85 over all finite convex decompositions @xmath86 with @xmath87 pure .",
    "again , we write @xmath8 for @xmath84 where @xmath71 belongs to the state space @xmath20 of a system @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast to measurement entropy , the mixing entropy of a state depends only on the geometry of the state space @xmath20 , and is independent of the choice of test space @xmath29 .",
    "the mixing entropy of a pure state is @xmath88 .",
    "trivially , in classical probability theory , measurement and mixing entropies coincide , both being simply the shannon entropy .",
    "much less trivially , measurement and mixing entropies also coincide in quantum theory , where they equal the von neumann entropy .",
    "can be obtained from the eigenvalues of @xmath65 by a doubly stochastic matrix ( shrodinger s lemma ) , which can only increase entropy . an easier version of the same argument ( also noted by hein @xcite ) shows that the spectral decomposition also minimizes measurement entropy .",
    "] as the following example shows , however , measurement and mixing entropies can be quite different .",
    "( the firefly model ) let @xmath89 .",
    "this test space is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : firefly ] .",
    "one can check that @xmath30 has five pure states , one of which is given by @xmath90 : since this is pure , @xmath91 , yet @xmath92 . on the other hand , consider the pure states @xmath93 and @xmath94 determined by @xmath95 and @xmath96 : their average , @xmath97 has mixing entropy @xmath98 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the only convex decomposition of @xmath99 into pure states is into @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which in turn follows from the fact that these are the only pure states that assign probability one to @xmath100 . on the other hand , @xmath101 , so @xmath102 .        even in the general case ,",
    "measurement entropy is quite well behaved .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that @xmath76 is continous as a function of @xmath71 .",
    "further ,    measurement entropy is concave , i.e. , if @xmath103 is a convex combination of states @xmath87 on @xmath104 , then @xmath105    since for each test @xmath12 the local entropy @xmath106 is concave , @xmath107    mixing entropy is , by contrast , a curious beast .",
    "the following example shows that it need not be continuous as a function of the state .",
    "[ noncontinuousexample ] let @xmath108 be the convex hull of the circle @xmath109 and the line segment @xmath110 ( figure  [ noncontinuousfigure ] ) .",
    "let @xmath71 denote the point of intersection of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , i.e. , the point @xmath113 .",
    "the extreme points of this set are evidently the endpoints of @xmath111 , together with the points of @xmath114 .",
    "note that @xmath71 has a unique decomposition as a mixture of extreme points of @xmath20 , namely , as an equal mixture of the endpoints of @xmath111 .",
    "thus , @xmath115 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath71 can be approached as closely as we like by extreme points belonging to @xmath114 , which have mixing entropy @xmath88 .",
    "the mixing entropy is therefore discontinuous at @xmath71 .",
    "for which mixing entropy is not everywhere continuous ( see example  [ noncontinuousexample ] ) . ]",
    "_ let @xmath20 be a square .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath93 be the midpoints of adjacent faces , noting that these each have unit mixing entropy , @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath117 be the mid - point of the line segment between @xmath71 and @xmath93 , and note that it also lies on the line segment between antipodal vertices of @xmath20 ( the diagonal through the square between the chosen faces ) . but given that @xmath94 is not at the midpoint of this diagonal , the shannon entropy for the associated convex decomposition is less than one , as is therefore the infimum over convex decompositions .",
    "therefore , the mixing entropy for @xmath94 satisfies @xmath118 .",
    "consequently , @xmath119 , and we have a failure of concavity of the mixing entropy . _        in fact , the failure of concavity for the mixing entropy is quite generic .",
    "[ mixnonconcavetheorem ] mixing entropy is not concave whenever the state space @xmath20 is a non - simplicial polytope .    the proof is given in appendix  [ mixnonconcave ] .",
    "it follows that an assumption of concavity for the mixing entropy forces the state space to be either a simplex ( i.e. classical ) or not a polytope .",
    "hence such an assumption or one that implies it may be a useful tool in axiomatizing quantum theory .",
    "it is natural to ask what follows from the condition that , as in classical and quantum theories , measurement and mixing entropy coincide .",
    "one immediate consequence is that mixing entropy will be concave . in view of theorem  [ mixnonconcavetheorem ] , this implies that either the system is essentially classical , or there are an infinite number of pure states",
    ". hence equality of measurement and mixing entropies narrows down possible theories quite a lot .",
    "we discuss this matter further in appendix  [ monoentropic ] .    both measurement and mixing entropy",
    "have been considered before , notably by hein @xcite , in a similar context , albeit with somewhat different aims than ours in view .",
    "there are various other entropic quantities one could reasonably consider .",
    "for example , a concept of entropy that might be more closely related to operational tasks is the supremum , over convex decompositions of the state and over tests , of the classical mutual information between the random variable specifying the element of the convex decomposition , and the random outcome of the test .",
    "natural analogues of this quantity and of the measurement and preparation entropies defined above exist in the closely related ordered linear spaces framework ( also known as the convex sets framework ) for theories .",
    "test space models such as we have defined above induce ordered linear spaces models by a linearization procedure that embeds the test space in a vector space and identifies outcomes in the test space with certain elements of the dual vector space ; this procedure allows one to define concepts of measurement entropy more tightly related to the geometry of the state space , but that can usually be viewed as special cases of the test space definition .",
    "appendix [ appendix : linearization ] gives a further brief discussion of this .    from this point on , we focus mainly on measurement entropy .",
    "as always with mathematical definitions , there is a certain tension between the ideals of flexibility and generality , on the one hand , and , on the other , the desire to avoid annoying pathologies .",
    "our test - space dependent",
    "definition of measurement entropy definitely errs on the side of the former , in that it is consistent with quite absurd examples . for example , if one includes in one s test space a test having a single outcome , then all states will automatically have zero entropy .",
    "one can avoid such difficulties by placing various restrictions on the test spaces to be considered , at the cost of a slightly more involved technical development .",
    "going to the linearized setting mentioned above may also help .",
    "our work in this paper does not demand such fastidiousness , however , as our results are of a very general character .",
    "most of the interesting problems of information theory involve more than one system .",
    "the following subsection describes how to treat composite systems in the language of test spaces .",
    "the idea is that , given systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the joint system @xmath4 should be associated with a test space and state space of its own . however , there is not a unique recipe for determining test and state spaces for @xmath4 given the test and state spaces for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . instead",
    ", a theory must give additional rules that specify how systems combine .",
    "our results will pertain to a variety of notions of composition , although we limit the scope by requiring certain properties to hold .",
    "in particular , we assume that the test space of the composite includes all product tests and conditional two - stage tests ( where one party s choice of test is conditioned on the outcome of the other party s test ) .",
    "one motivation for this is to have a test space that is sufficiently rich to be interesting .",
    "another motivation is that this assumption guarantees that all states are non - signaling .",
    "we go on to define analogues of familiar quantities , such as joint entropies and the mutual information , which are used later to analyze information causality .",
    "consider two systems , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "for convenience , assume that these are controlled by two parties , called alice and bob .",
    "the first , and most basic , assumption we shall make is that alice can perform any test @xmath26 simultaneously with bob performing any test @xmath122 .",
    "this can be regarded as a single _ product test_. the possible outcomes of this product test are pairs of the form @xmath123 .",
    "the _ cartesian product _ of the test spaces @xmath19 and @xmath124 is the collection of all product tests . it is denoted @xmath125 .    the set @xmath126 , of all states that can be defined on the cartesian product test space , typically includes _ signaling _ states , which allow alice to send messages instantaneously to bob , or vice versa , by varying her choice of which test to perform .",
    "a state @xmath127 on @xmath125 is _ non - signaling _",
    "iff @xmath128",
    "if a state @xmath127 is non - signaling , it is possible to define the _ marginal _ ( or _ reduced _ ) state @xmath129 via @xmath130 where eq .",
    "( [ nosignaling ] ) ensures that the right hand side is independent of @xmath122 .",
    "the marginal @xmath131 is defined similarly .",
    "if @xmath127 is non - signaling , it is also possible to define a _",

    "informally , this is the updated state at bob s end following the outcome @xmath133 being obtained for a test at alice s end : @xmath134 by convention , @xmath132 is zero if @xmath135 is zero .",
    "the conditional state @xmath136 is defined similarly .",
    "notice that a particular type of measurement , which might be thought reasonable , is not included in the cartesian product .",
    "this is a joint measurement , where alice first measures her system , and communicates the result to bob , who performs a measurement which depends on alice s outcome .",
    "entangled measurements , such as are allowed in quantum theory , are also not included .",
    "hence the cartesian product @xmath125 models a situation in which alice and bob are fairly limited - they can act independently and collate the results of their actions at a later time , but can not otherwise communicate .",
    "it is possible to construct a more sophisticated product of two test spaces , which does allow for the kind of two stage measurements just described ( although still not entangled measurements ) .",

    "the containment of one test space in another has consequences for their state spaces . specifically , if @xmath143 and @xmath144 are test spaces such that @xmath145 , then the convex set @xmath146 may be in a higher dimensional space than @xmath147 , but the restrictions of states in @xmath148 to @xmath149 ( which are well - defined , since every test in @xmath149 is also a test in @xmath150 ) are all contained in @xmath151 . in other words ,",

    "ray - extremal effects can not be further refined by decomposing them as sums of other effects .",
    "although they can be decomposed as sums of shrunken versions of themselves , intuitively this can not provide any additional information about the system being measured . certainly in the case of atomic effects , and probably with some care and relabeling in the case of ray - extremal effects ( which unlike atomic effects may appear more than once in a given observable ) , the measurements with such outcomes can be organized into distinguished test spaces associated with a given convex - sets model , so the test space framework we use in the main text will probably cover this natural possibility , although the additional assumptions we make to obtain particular results will need to be checked for these cases . in the case of ray - extremal effects , the infimum in the definition of measurement entropy will likely not be changed if we omit measurements in which an effect appears more than once ; the measurements without repetitions should be easier to organize into a test space .",
    "linearization and the application of one of these definitions may well remove pathologies in measurement entropy that are associated with some test space / state space models .",
    "the spirit of the definition of measurement entropy via an infimum suggests excluding tests that are not maximally fine grained when viewed from the convex states perspective , as the above definitions do . passing to these definitions",
    "may also remove pathologies that might arise when the set of distinguished observables associated with tests has an irregular relationship to a state space whose underlying geometry is quite regular ."
