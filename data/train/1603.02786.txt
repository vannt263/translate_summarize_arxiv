    "the bhs is dominated by the high - metal gas in the galactic center and the disk where @xmath140 .",
    "as it expands into the halo , the bhs becomes dominated by the swept halo gas and intergalactic gas with @xmath141 .",
    "however , the radiative cooling does not contribute much to the dynamical evolution of the bhs , namely simulations assuming a different metallicity would result in almost the same result .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray brightness was calculated for the observed metallicity in the galactic halo with @xmath142 .",
    "hence , the metallicity in the simulation and in the brightness calculation is not fully consistent with each other .",
    "a consistent modeling would be a subject for the future .",
    "we have presented the result of bhs simulation for a continuous energy injection ( type c injection ) with @xmath41 ergs in the last 10 myr presuming recurrent starbursts in the galactic center ( sb model ) .",
    "the total injected energy is smaller than those estimated for super winds in starburst galaxies ( heckman et al .",
    "1990 ) , while greater than that for the starburst galaxy m82 ( lacki et al .",
    "it is also greater than that proposed for the galactic center in order to produce the fermi bubbles ( crocker et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the total injected energy @xmath143 is finally transformed to the thermal @xmath144 , kinetic @xmath145 , and gravitational @xmath146 energies of the bhs as well as to the radiatively lost energy by cooling @xmath147 : @xmath148 individual energies are approximately estimated using the figures presented in section 2 as the following . the bhs mass is estimated to be @xmath149 for the both sides , each with a radius @xmath150 kpc and thickness @xmath151 kpc and mean density of @xmath152 .",
    "the thermal energy is estimated for a mean temperature of @xmath153 k , where @xmath154 being the gas constant .",
    "the kinetic energy is estimated for an expansion velocity @xmath155 .",
    "the gravitational energy can be estimated by @xmath156 , where @xmath18 is the gravitational potential , @xmath157 kpc and @xmath158 kpc are the initial and the present heights of bhs gas .",
    "the galactic mass within a radius @xmath159 kpc is estimated by @xmath160 for a rotation velocity @xmath161 .",
    "the radiative loss during @xmath119 myr is estimated for a cooling rate of @xmath162 at @xmath153 k and @xmath163 .",
    "we now obtain : = p dv ~ t ~2.5 10 ^ 56ergs , ~1/2 v_expa^2~810 ^ 55 ergs , ~~210 ^ 55ergs ,",
    "~t n^2 p(t ) dv ~310 ^ 54 , and _ 0=+++~510 ^ 56 .",
    "the estimation using the figure may include an error of @xmath164% , that is the reason for the larger figure of total energy than the input intival value of @xmath165 ergs .",
    "the relative fractions of the energies compared to @xmath143 are rather more accurate , and are : @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 .",
    "the small radiative loss implies that the bhs is almost adiabatic .",
    "this can be confirmed by the long cooling time , @xmath170 yrs , far longer than the expansion time of the shell .",
    "this implies that the bhs dynamics is little depends on the cooling rate , and hence on the density and metallicity .",
    "namely , the result will be not changed much even if we adopt smaller metallicity than the assumed value ( 1 solar ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the total energy on the order of @xmath171 ergs is inevitably required in order to reproduce the observed x - ray nps and associated spurs in the bhs model for the given halo density .",
    "thereby , the emission measure ( density ) , temperature ( velocity ) , and the linear size of the nps are the strongest observational constraint on the total energy .",
    "if the halo density is decreased by a factor of 1/1.3 as indicated by comparison with the emission measure observed with _ suzaku _ , the total energy will be eased by the same factor , considering the sedov s similarity factor @xmath172 in the shock wave .",
    "thus , we conclude that the total injected energy to drive the nps is @xmath173 ergs .",
    "given the total energy as above , the assumed rate of energy supply of @xmath174 ergs myr@xmath43 is required in the c - type injection model , though reduced by a factor of 1/1.3 .",
    "if we consider an sb model , it requires a type ii supernova rate as high as @xmath175 per 10 myr , or 1 sn per 20 to 30 yrs in the galactic center , comparable to the sn rate in the entire galaxy . the assumed inflow rate of @xmath176 yr@xmath43 is comparable , but slightly greater than the often quoted rate @xmath177 yr@xmath43 ( kruijssen et al . 2013 ; krumuholz and kruijssen 2015 ) .",
    "hence , it may be worth to consider other types of mechanism of energy injection energy in the galactic center .",
    "an additional or alternative energy source to drive the bhs could be the e - type energy injection at the center .",
    "a powerful energy source without suffering from the problem about star formation and mass inflow would be the e - type explosion due to agn activity at the galactic nucleus , which occurs intermittently each with smaller energy ( totani et al .",
    "in this case the total energy is given by @xmath178 , and the mass inflow rate is accordingly reduced with increasing agn activity .",
    "figure [ machcone ] shows a central @xmath179 region in the simulated 1.5 kev brightness compared with rosat r7 image . in the simulation ,",
    "a cone - shaped bow shock is recognized as bipolar inclined spurs emerging from the central region , which is a sonic boom , or mach cone , produced by the interaction of the outflow with the dense wall of the holed disk .",
    "the mach angle of the cone is @xmath180 , indicating a mach number @xmath181 .",
    "this is consistent with the postulated outflow velocity and temperature of the gas in the corresponding region .",
    "the mach cone morphologically reproduces the x - ray bipolar conical structure .",
    "however , the simulated cone is fainter compared to the observation",
    ". brighter cone could be obtained , if the energy injection rate was not constant , but varied intermittently , so that the most recent injection was strong enough to enhance the cone s emissivity .",
    "this idea is consistent with the shorter time scale , @xmath182 yrs , suggested for the fermi bubbles with which the x - ray claw feature in the southern spur is associated ( kataoka et al .",
    "2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "figure [ cutgc ] shows a cross section of the simulated distribution of 1.5 kev brightness along the galactic plane .",
    "there appear three characteristic regions .",
    "a round hot zone of high - temperature plasma is produced by the injection of starburst thermal energy in the central @xmath183 pc at @xmath184 .",
    "a shock - compressed ring of radius @xmath50 kpc at the root of the hot cone at @xmath185 appears as the two horn like enhancement of x - rays . a larger radius ring of a radius @xmath186 kpc appears as the broad maxima at @xmath187 corresponding to the root of the bhs .",
    "these three structures may be related to observed features in the galactic center at various wavelengths .",
    "the central hot zone may correspond to the high - temperature plasma at @xmath188 kev observed in hard x - ray emissions ( uchiyama et al .",
    "the 1 kpc ring may be a scaled up event of the various gas rings ( bania 1980 ; sofue 1995 ; law 2010 ; krumholz and kruijssen 2015 ) . the 3.3 kpc compressed ring associated with bhs coincides with the 3-kpc expanding ring observed in the hi line longitude - velocity diagram ( oort 1977 ) . as readily known by a fast - mode mhd wave calculation ( sofue 1977 )",
    ", the compression occurs from outside of the disk by refraction and focusing of the shock wave propagating through the halo .        in figures",
    "[ xsky3 ] and [ cut ] the observed north - south and east - west asymmetry is evident in the sense that the nps is a few times brighter than sps and that the nps - e and -w are inclined toward the west compared to the simulation .",
    "the north - south asymmetry may indicate that the electron density in the north is significantly higher than in the south .",
    "such an asymmetry of the bhs could be produced by an intergalactic wind or a motion of the galaxy through the intergalactic gas ( sofue 1994 ) .",
    "the wind will yield higher density and pressure in the northern halo , whereas the southern halo suffers from rarefaction due to shading by the galactic disk from the wind .",
    "the axial asymmetry could also be explained by a wind from the east to west .",
    "hence , we may speculate that an intergalactic wind blows from the galactic north - east toward south - west .",
    "diagnosis of intergalactic wind using the bhs morphology would be a subject for future 3d simulations .",
