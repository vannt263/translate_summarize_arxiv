    "gas phase metallicity determinations in star - forming regions ( sfrs ) have been used for the knowledge of the cosmic evolution of galaxies as well as to provide observational constraints on model parameters of galaxy formation .    in particular",
    ", the oxygen is the element most widely used for this purpose , because prominent emission lines from their main ionic stages are present in the optical spectra of sfrs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . for the rest of elements with bright emission - lines ( e.g. n ,",
    "s , ne , ar ) not all their ionic stages are observed in the optical spectrum , so their total abundances can only be calculated by means of ionization correction factors ( icfs ) , proposed by @xcite .    among the @xmath2-elements , ne results of great importance",
    "as it is one of the noble gases and it does not combine with itself or with other chemical species in the formation of molecules and , thus , dust grains .",
    "this makes the abundance determination of this element quite suitable for the study of the chemical evolution of sfrs as it does not depend on depletion factors onto dust grains .",
    "it is accepted that ne and o are mainly produced in stars more massive than 10 @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that abundances of ne and o should closely trace one to the other @xcite , and a constant ne / o abundance ratio over a wide range of o / h abundance must be found . however , recent deep spectroscopy of a large sample of low - metallicity emission - line galaxies by @xcite revealed a slight increase of ne / o with o / h .",
    "similar results were also found by @xcite using o and ne abundances of a sample of planetary nebulae and regions . in opposite",
    ", @xcite derived a new icf for ne using a photoionization model grid finding for the high metallicity regime a slight decrease in ne / o with o / h for a large sample of sfrs .    in any case , the derivation of the total ne abundance has showed to be uncertain due to the difficulties estimating its icf .",
    "the estimation of the total ne abundance in the optical is performed via the observation of the [ ] @xmath43869   emission - line , which is mainly present in sfrs with a high - ionization degree , and usually assuming an icf(@xmath5 ) that is a function of the o/@xmath6 ratio derived also from optical emission - lines .",
    "however , the optical [ ] line is rarely observed in metal - rich objects ( see @xcite ) , where most of the ne is in the form of @xmath7 , so the ionization corrections are not well constrained in this regime @xcite .",
    "this problem can be alleviated by the use of infrared fine - structure lines @xcite . on this context , both the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( _ iso _ , @xcite ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _ have allowed the observation of bright mid - infrared emission - lines in sfrs , such as [ ] 12.81@xmath8 m and [ ] 15.56@xmath8 m , and the determination of the total ne abundance simply summing the corresponding ionic fractions .",
    "for instance , @xcite used optical and mid - ir data of regions located in the magellanic clouds ( see also * ? ? ? * ) to determine o , s , and ne abundances in these objects .",
    "these authors found large discrepancies between @xmath5 abundances obtained via infrared lines with those via optical temperature determinations and pointed out that the classical approximation , icf(@xmath9)=o/@xmath6 @xcite , seems to underestimate the true ne abundance ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to large scatter and uncertainty in the @xmath5 ionic fraction of their data , no conclusion could be drawn about the reliability of the optical icf for ne .",
    "the same results were obtained by @xcite , who combined the ionic abundances derived by @xcite and by @xcite for regions located in m33 .",
    "however , they were not able to derive a functional form for the icf(@xmath5 ) , due to the large scatter of the available data and the very few measurements for low - ionization regions .",
    "fortunately , a large number of mid - ir and optical data of sfrs are currently available in the literature , which enables a direct determination of the optical icf for ne and a comparison among abundances obtained from distinct methods , yielding a more reliable conclusion about the total ne abundance .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to examine the ne abundance of sfrs , investigating the abundance discrepancy found by the use of different methods and obtaining a reliable icf in the optical for this element . to do that ,",
    "we compiled observed optical and infrared emission - line fluxes from the literature to derive the ne ionic abundances .",
    "a photoionization model grid was also used in this analysis .",

    "optical and infrared emission - line fluxes of a sample of emission - line galaxies ( elgs )  including galaxies ( gs ) , wolf rayet galaxies ( wrgs ) , blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) and dwarf galaxies ( dgs )  and regions ( rs ) were compiled from the literature .",
    "their emission - line intensities were already reddening corrected in the works from which we take the data . for most of the data",
    "this was done by using the ratio @xmath10 and in some cases , where @xmath11 was not present in the spectra , the reddening coefficient was obtained from another hydrogen lines ( e.g. data of @xcite ) .",

    "the optical data were obtained by the use of long - slit , echelle and multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) , while the infrared data were obtained with the _ iso _ and _ spitzer space telescope_.    in the optical , we used the [ ] @xmath45007/h@xmath12 vs. [ ] @xmath46584/h@xmath2 and [ ] @xmath45007/h@xmath12 vs. [ ] ( @xmath46716+@xmath46731)/h@xmath2 diagnostic diagrams ( figure  [ fdisc1 ] ) to distinguish objects ionized by massive stars from those containing an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and/or gas excited by shocks . to separate the distinct classes of objects",

    ", we divided the sample into five groups according to the available emission - lines measured for each object :    * group a - optical emission - lines , including the ones needed to directly estimate the electron temperatures and abundances .",

    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the bibliographic references of the sample , the number of objects taken from each work , their nature , the observational technique used during the data acquisition , and the group(s ) to which the data belong .",
    "the objects in the a , b and e groups allow the computation of the ionic abundances and the icfs from several methods used along the paper , while the ones in the c and d groups only enable a more accurate comparison between the data and the photoionization models to obtain a theoretical neon icf .",
    "to investigate the discrepancy between the neon ionic abundances from optical and infrared emission - lines , we selected the objects in our sample for which we can get a direct estimation of , at least , an electron temperature .",
    "they are those belonging to the optical groups a and b , and also to the ir group e. the sub - sample contains 23 objects and they are listed in table  [ tab1a ] together with the corresponding optical and ir references .",

    "the years several authors have compiled spectroscopy data of star - forming regions from the literature in order to derive correlations between macroscopic properties of these objects ( e.g. @xcite ) , or have suggested oxygen abundance calibrations using strong emission - lines ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the use of data sets obtained with different instrumentation and observational techniques , and including different objects such as whole galaxies , galaxy nuclei and individual rs , i.e.  non - homogeneous data , could lead to biased results . in what follows",
    "we investigate the possible sources of biases introduced in the present study due to the heterogeneity of our data set .",
    "differences between the measurement apertures used in the optical and ir observations could contribute significantly to the discrepancies found between optical and ir abundance determinations @xcite because many physical properties ( e.g. , stellar populations , metallicity , extinction ) of galaxies vary with galactocentric radius @xcite or along nebulae @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed analysis of the effect of aperture size on the star formation rate , metallicity , and reddening determinations for galaxies selected from the nearby field galaxy survey .",
    "they found that systematic and random errors from aperture effects can arise if fibers capture less than 20% of the galaxy light .",
    "most of the sfrs in our sample can be treated as point sources and almost all the object extensions are observed , therefore , for these objects this effect is negligible . for the spatially resolved magellanic rs in our sample",
    "( see table [ tab1a ] ) this effect could play a more important role as was already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , since our aim is to study the discrepancy found for the ne@xmath18 ionic abundances and this ion is not expected to be formed in the extended low - surface brightness zones around sfrs , aperture effects neither represent an important factor .",
    "there are several ways to determine the reddening correction to be applied to the observed emission - line fluxes depending on the available information and the ad hoc assumptions .",
    "for example , the use of different ratios involving hydrogen emission - line fluxes , different extinction curves , and the use of a wide spectral range .",
    "all these facts could introduce some biases in our results . to investigate this effect , in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] we plotted the h@xmath2/h@xmath12 ratios against the ionization degree parametrized by the [ ] @xmath45007/[]@xmath43727 ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , we can conclude that differences in the reddening correction does not affect any statistical result obtained in this work .",

    "this may yield an additional scatter in the abundance determinations computed along this work that might lead to biased results .",
    "for example , if emission - lines with a broad component are present in low resolution spectra these could not be detected , and several physical properties obtained from these lines will be unreliable , such as abundance determinations ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . also , heavy elements abundance determinations from spectra with low signal - to - noise ratio can be overestimated @xcite .",
    "however , discrepancies in emission - line ratios estimated for a given object observed using different techniques ranging from about 0.03 to 0.1dex @xcite translate into a few percent in the uncertainties of ionic abundance determinations . for example , if this discrepancy in the line ratio [ ] ( @xmath45007+@xmath44959)/@xmath44363 is 0.06dex , the electron temperature derived using the different observations differs by about 400k , yielding a log(ne / o ) variation of about 0.1dex .",

    "our sample is composed by objects with different morphology and sizes , nevertheless they all have young and massive stellar clusters as their main ionization sources .",
    "the shape of the emission - line spectra of the objects in our sample is dominated by the ionizing fluxes from these massive stars .",
    "therefore the same measurement and analysis techniques can be applied to derive the temperatures , densities and chemical composition of their interstellar gas @xcite .    in general ,",

    "* ) implying that similar ionization mechanisms are taking place in these two different kind of objects ( see fig .  [ fdisc1 ] ) .",
    "other ionizing mechanisms could be present according to the evolutionary stages and the nature of the objects , such as galactic winds due to supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contribution to the hydrogen emission fluxes by diffuse ionized gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the statistical contribution of these mechanisms is similar for the different kind of objects and they do not yield any bias on the physical conditions of the objects obtained in the present work .",
    "to estimate the icf for ne via photoionization models , we compared the results of a grid of models performed using the cloudy/8.0 code @xcite with the observational data sample .",

    ", this effect could be enhanced by the use of h@xmath12 or br@xmath12 emission lines instead of hu@xmath2 to derive ionic abundances in the mid - ir . in order to verify the extinction influence on the emission - lines , models with different internal dust abundance were built . in these ,",
    "the only effect of grains on the continuous opacity was considered , i.e. the gas heating by grain emission was not considered in the calculations .",

    "[ fdust ] the predicted luminosity values ( @xmath69 ) for some hydrogen and neon emission - lines in relation to the ones predicted by the model free of dust ( @xmath70=0 ) are shown .",

    "[ mod ] , and was already noticed by @xcite and @xcite , the photoionization models can not reproduce diagnostic diagrams based on ne mid - ir lines independently of the used stellar atmospheres .",
    "therefore , this could be symptomatic of inaccurate atomic data involving these emission - lines and can be on the basis of the found discrepancies when deriving abundances from optical and mid - ir emission lines . in particular , the atomic parameter which can affect the abundance determinations is the collision strength for the [ ] @xmath72 emission - line . however , it is not probable that uncertainties in this parameter be the main cause of the discrepancy found in our study . along",
    "the years differences in neon collision strength have been found .",

    "they showed that different @xmath74 values are obtained by the use of these suppositions , in the sense that for 56-level breit - pauli calculation @xmath74 ranges from about 0.5 to 1.0 and for the 554-levels icft ranges from about 0.4 to 0.8 .",
    "it must be noted that these results are in good agreement with earlier derivations .",
    "nevertheless , e ven assuming that the collision strength for the [ ] @xmath72 emission - line can vary by a factor of two , it is not enough to conciliate the ionic abundance discrepancy .    finally , another supposition is the presence of electron temperature fluctuation amplitude inside the ionized gas .",
    "it can lead to an underestimation of the ionic abundances obtained via optical collisionally - excited lines when these fluctuations are not considered since these lines are strongly dependent on the electron temperature ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . since the electron temperatures are related with the chemical composition of the emitting gas , temperature fluctuations are essentially equivalent to abundance variations across the nebula @xcite",
    "to test the effect of the presence of temperature fluctuations and/or abundance variations , we built a grid of photoionization models using cloudy .",

    "we considered a nebula with @xmath77 , with an inner radius of 4pc and an outer radius where the temperature falls below 4000k ( @xmath4730pc ) , and a number of hydrogen - ionizing photons emitted by the ionizing star cluster of @xmath78 .",
    "it was assumed that the metallicity varies along the radius of the nebula as a sine wave , with period p ranging from 0.01 to 2pc , including 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 and 1 pc .",
    "also a model with no variations and solar abundance was considered .",
    "we considered a set of models with an abundance amplitude of 0.8dex , which takes metallicity values between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite built grids of photoionization models using similar sine wave variations but applied to the total hydrogen density across the nebula .",
    "we used the emission - line intensities given by our models for each value of p to calculate the @xmath0 ionic abundances applying the visible - lines and the ir - lines methods following the same procedure as described in section  [ ion ] .",
    "thus , we obtain two estimations of @xmath81 for each model . fig .",
    "[ f10 ] shows these estimated values of @xmath0 plotted as a function of the period p of the abundance variations .",

    "when abundance variations are present the differences could reach about 0.5 dex , being the ionic abundances via the ir - lines method the largest one .",
    "this value is very similar to the one found in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] between the estimated ne ionic abundances derived applying the visible - lines and the ir - lines methods to the observational data .",
    "moreover , these differences , as expected , depend on the metallicity amplitude of the models , increasing ( decreasing ) with an increment ( decrement ) in the amplitude ( models not shown ) .",
    "therefore , the temperature fluctuations studied through the abundance variations across the nebula could be a probable explanation for the discrepancy between the estimated ne abundances by these two methods . in fig .",

    "we found , as expected , that abundance variations translates into temperature fluctuations .",

    "a more detailed study about spatial electron temperature fluctuations in ionized nebulae from photoionization models is given by @xcite .",
    "along decades observations have failed in found a direct evidence of chemical inhomogeneities in regions ( e.g. @xcite ) and in planetary nebulae ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , an another source of temperature fluctuations can be the presence of density variations in the gas .",
    "@xcite showed that large - scale variations in electron density in the gas do arise electron temperature fluctuations .",
    "considering the region models of @xcite , this author pointed out that if @xmath25 varies by a factor of about 10 , the electron temperature can range up to 2000 k ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite presented results from integral field spectroscopy of a region near to the trapezium cluster and found the presence of high - density gas ( @xmath85 ) , which are much higher than the typical values obtained either for galactic and extragalactic regions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , a larger number of observations , such as the ones by @xcite , are needed to confirm the high scale density fluctuations in ionized nebulae .",
    "another likely reason for the presence temperature fluctuations are different proximities of gas to the ionizing o stars , since these are mainly responsible for the ionization structure . to test this , we built models considering different distances , @xmath86 , between the central ionizing source and the inner face of the gas , where @xmath86 ranged from 0.1 to 7 pc .",
    "these values are consistent with the ones used by @xcite in a study of the galactic region g0.18 - 0.04 .",

    "[ estru ] ( top panel ) the temperature structure of the models is shown .",
    "we can note a hot region very near the central star , however , this region is too small to affect the derived abundances , since no significant changes among the models neither in the @xmath82 nor in @xmath34 values are obtained .",
    "models with a more complicated geometry , with many stars distributed through the gas ( e.g. @xcite ) , might cause the temperature variations and consequently help to explain @xmath0 ionic discrepancies .",
    "the icfs stand for the unseen ionization stages of each element . for the @xmath5 it is defined as @xmath87    the icf for @xmath5 can be directly computed using only [ ] 12.81@xmath8 m and [ ] 15.56@xmath8 m emission - line fluxes .",

    "moreover , @xcite , using mid - ir derivations of the neon abundances of a sample of rs located in m33 , obtained a flat neon abundance gradient as a function of the galactocentric radius , as well as a decrement of the ne / o ratio when the o / h increases .    to investigate this issue",

    "[ f5 ] to the ionic @xmath5 abundances estimated using the visible - lines method to obtain total ne abundances for the compiled sample .",

    "we also show the logarithm of the average ne / o value derived using the different icfs , and their standard deviations .",
    "these average values are consistent in all the cases with the adopted solar one . from a visual inspection of the distributions of our observational sample in these diagrams , can be seen that there is a flat relation between the logarithms of the ne / o and the o / h ratios for the whole studied metallicity range , from about 7 to 8.5dex .",

    "this ne / o variation is very similar to the standard deviation of the data .",
    "we also analysed the statistical dependence of ne / o with o / h using the spearman s rank correlation on the data , finding that the ne / o is statistically constant independently of the metallicity value . another test was done considering different metallicity regimes .",

    "this flat ne / o vs. o / h behaviour for the whole range of o / h analysed is a robust test of nucleosynthesis prediction and supports a very limited ( if any ) oxygen depletion in dust .",
    "the oxygen abundances in grains are poorly known .",
    "for example , @xcite interpreted that the slight increase of ne / o with the metallicity is due to depletion of about 20% of o onto grains .",
    "also , @xcite found an increasing depletion of o atoms of about 0.1 dex with increasing o / h for three objects in a large range of metallicity . from our data we derived a dispersion of ne / o for a fixed o / h value of @xmath710.10 dex .",
    "therefore , none conclusion can be obtained about the oxygen depletion on dust .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     on the other hand , it must be noted that the scatter of the ne / o increases with the metallicity , showing the distribution of the data a triangular - like shape .",
    "this result was also found by @xcite for rs in m101 , ngc2403 and dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "they argued that this effect can reflect high sensitivity to the local radiation field as ne@xmath18 and o@xmath18 become minor constituents of the nebular material when the o@xmath64/o increases , which is equivalent to a metallicity increment .",
    "as the metallicity of the gas material increases the electron temperature decreases , thus , the ne@xmath18 and o@xmath18 emission - line intensities becomes weak .",
    "therefore , the increment of scatter going to the higher abundances should be a normal behaviour admitting that errors in the measurements of the sensitive lines are found to be larger ( statistically ) for higher abundance rs .",
    "in fact the triangular shape mentioned is probably just a product of this .",
    "we have also tested the dependence of ne / o on the temperature fluctuations , since neon and oxygen have slightly different temperature coefficients . using the earlier result models and computing ne / h and o / h following the same procedure described in sect .  [ ion ]",
    ", we found that log(ne / o ) is @xmath230.53 and @xmath230.36 for p=0.0 and 0.01 , respectively .",

    "\\(iv ) variations of chemical abundances across the nebula . using a grid of photoionization models we showed that fluctuations with an amplitude of 0.8dex in the total abundance ( for both o and ne ) can produce the degree of discrepancy between the ionic ne@xmath18 abundances derived from optical and mid - ir emission - lines .",
    "using ionic ne abundances estimations from mid - ir emission - lines , we obtained an expression for the icf of the @xmath5 as a function of the o@xmath18/(o@xmath64+o@xmath18 ) ratio .",

    "<S> photoionization models with abundance variations along the radius of the hypothetical nebula provide a possible explanation for a large part of the difference between ionic abundances via optical and infrared emission - lines . </S>",
    "<S> ionization correction factor ( icf ) for the neon is obtained from direct determinations of ionic fractions using infrared emission - lines . </S>",
    "<S> a constant ne / o ratio ( @xmath1 ) for a large range of metallicity , independently of the icf used to compute the neon total abundance is derived .    </S>",
