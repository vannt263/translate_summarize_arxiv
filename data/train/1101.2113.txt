    "galex  j193156.8 + 011745 ( galex  j1931 + 0117 , thereafter ) is a hydrogen - rich white dwarf discovered by @xcite and characterized by an opulent heavy - element line spectrum and an infrared excess .",
    "the original low - resolution spectrum obtained with the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla observatory showed a strong mgii@xmath54481 doublet and weaker silicon lines .",
    "follow - up echelle spectroscopy obtained with the very large telescope ( vlt)-kueyen enabled a detailed abundance study .",
    "the near - solar abundances of oxygen , magnesium , silicon , calcium and iron bear the signature of an external supply of material accreting onto the surface of the white dwarf . based on available data , vennes et al . concluded that the supply may originate from a close , sub - stellar companion or from a cool debris disc .",
    "the presence of heavy elements in hydrogen - rich white dwarfs has variously been interpreted as intrinsic to the white dwarf , or as extrinsic , i.e. , supplied by the interstellar medium @xcite , by a nearby companion as in post - common envelope systems @xcite , or by a debris disc @xcite .",
    "however , accretion from the interstellar medium is unlikely because of supply shortages @xcite . in the extrinsic scenarios ,",
    "the elements are accreted and diffused in the atmosphere and envelope of the star ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an intrinsic , or internal , reservoir of heavy elements is also possible , but in either scenario a self - consistent solution of the diffusion equation must explore the effect of radiative acceleration on trace elements @xcite .    as a class ,",
    "the polluted da white dwarfs , or dazs , are often defined by the detection of the caii h&k doublet in optical spectra of cooler objects @xcite , or by the detection of carbon and silicon in the ultraviolet spectra of warmer objects @xcite .",
    "exceptionally , mgii@xmath54481 is , so far , only detected in a handful of warm white dwarfs such as eg  102 @xcite , galex  j1931 + 0117 , and two warm white dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that show evidence of dusty and gaseous discs @xcite .",
    "the presence of a large concentration of magnesium in the last two objects helped establish a strong link between heavy element pollution and dense circumstellar environments .",
    "moreover , an infrared excess that can not otherwise be explained by a cool companion , may be attributed to a dust ring as in the case of the white dwarf g29 - 38 @xcite .",
    "we present new high - dispersion spectroscopic observations that help elucidate the nature of the peculiar abundance pattern in galex  j1931 + 0117 in support of the debris disc model .",
    "our observations are presented in section 2 , and a detailed line profile and abundance analysis is presented in section 3 . in section 3.1",
    "we compile and evaluate line broadening parameters and oscillator strengths . in section 3.2",
    "we describe steady - state diffusion models and predicted abundance gradients in the stable atmospheres of hot white dwarfs . in section 3.3",
    "we present revised abundances based on a review of atomic data , we assess non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) effects on measured abundances , and we constrain the accretion rates on the atmosphere of galex  j1931 + 0117 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 4 .",
    "following the identification of galex  j1931 + 0117 as a daz white dwarf we obtained a series of echelle spectra using standard settings with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) attached to the vlt - kueyen .",
    "all spectra were obtained with the slit width set at @xmath6 , offering a resolving power @xmath7 .",
    "the exposure times were 1450  s. the first series of spectra were obtained on ut 2009 nov 12 ( epoch 1 , thereafter ) with the dichroic # 2 and the `` her_5 '' and `` bk7_5 '' filters on the blue and red arms , respectively .",
    "the blue spectrum was centred at 4370  and covered the range 3757 - 4985 , and the red spectra were centred at 7600  and covered the ranges 5698 - 7532 and 7660 - 9464 . the first series of spectra were analysed by us @xcite .",
    "the second series of spectra were obtained on ut 2010 mar 15 ( epoch 2 , thereafter ) with the dichroic # 1 and the `` her_5 '' and `` shp700 '' filters on the blue and red arms , respectively .",
    "the blue spectrum was centred at 3900  and covered the range 3290 - 4518 , and the red spectra were centred at 5800  and covered the ranges 4788 - 5750 and 5839 - 6808 .",
    "we remeasured the h@xmath8 radial velocity by fitting gaussian profiles to the well - exposed , narrow line cores obtained at epochs 1 and 2 , @xmath9 kms@xmath2 and @xmath10 kms@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the two measurements are identical within errors .",
    "a lack of variations suggests that the da white dwarf is not in a close binary system .",
    "the average of the two measurements is @xmath11 kms@xmath2 .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] updates the spectral line identifications presented in @xcite .",
    "a set of nine feii lines were observed allowing us to improve our earlier iron abundance measurement .",
    "two strong siii lines are added to our list , but their line velocities deviate significantly from the rest velocity , set by h@xmath8 , by 6 and 7 kms@xmath2 .",
    "a closer examination of other siii lines observed at epoch 1 also reveals similar radial velocity shifts that shall be investigated in section 3.3.1 .",
    "the sulfur lines sii@xmath55014.069 , @xmath55032.447 , and @xmath55432.815  were not detected .",

    "we presented a model atmosphere analysis of the high - metallicity white dwarf galex  j1931 + 0117 . based on a critical review of available atomic data , their uncertainties , and their impact on the accuracy of abundance measurements",
    ", we revised the abundances presented by @xcite .",
    "the variations are not significant with the exception of magnesium which is revised downward by a factor of two .",
    "the abundance pattern shows that the abundance of magnesium , silicon , and iron is near or above the solar abundance , while the abundance of carbon , oxygen and calcium is below the solar abundance .",
    "a line profile analysis performed using vertical abundance distributions obtained by solving the steady - state diffusion equation shows that the accretion flow is rich in oxygen and silicon while it is depleted in other elements .",
    "the calculations show that although the oxygen abundance is below solar in the line forming region , it must be supplied in larger quantity because of its short diffusion time - scale relative to other elements .",
    "on the other hand , we show that introducing stark shifts in line profile modelling helped reduce the scatter in line velocity measurements to well within the expected accuracy of the echelle spectra .",
    "investigations of the effect of pressure shifts on radial velocity measurements are relatively rare but their effect have been predicted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a lack of radial velocity variations between two epochs that are 123 days apart also rules out a close binary scenario for the origin of the accreted material .",
    "we are left with the possibility that the infrared excess belongs to a warm disc of debris material that accretes onto the white dwarf surface .    the iron abundance in galex  j1931 +",
    "0117 is nearly solar @xcite and it is comparable to the iron abundance measured in much hotter white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the resurgence of iron in cooler white dwarfs is also evidence that an external reservoir reached the surface of these objects .",
    "simulated infrared spectral energy distributions for galexj1931 + 0117 including a spectral synthesis of the white dwarf added to a warm disc show that the observed distribution @xcite can be matched by a warm disc ( 900 k ) or a hot disc ( 1650 k ) near sublimation temperature .",
    "necessarily , the inferred dust temperature must be below sublimation temperatures ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the main constituents such as calcium ( 1659 k ) , or silicon and magnesium ( 1354 k )",
    ". therefore , the temperature as well as the size and state ( gas or solid ) of the disc is the result of an adjustment with the host white dwarf temperature and luminosity .",
    "the corresponding disc sizes are 90@xmath12 for the hot disc , and , compensating for its reduced emissivity per unit area , 2200@xmath12 for the warm disc , where @xmath12 is the solid angle subtended by the white dwarf itself .",
    "the observed spectral energy distribution extends to the 2mass measurements in the infrared and measurements at longer wavelengths are required to further constrain the model .",
    "a comparison with other warm daz white dwarfs supports these conjectures .",
    "the daz pg1015 + 161 ( @xmath13 k , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is similar to galex1931 + 0117 ( @xmath16 k , @xmath14 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "based on jhk and spitzer observations , @xcite inferred the presence of a disc with an inner temperature ranging from 800 to 1000 k and emitting area from 700 to 1200 @xmath12 . in a similar case , @xcite inferred the presence of a disc with a blackbody temperature of 1500k around pg1457 - 086 ( @xmath18 k , @xmath19 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "the great diversity in disc emissivity is illustrated by the case of hs0047 + 1903 . despite having a similar calcium abundance ,",
    "no evidence of a disc is found in jhk and spitzer observations @xcite .    in conclusion , our analysis of the abundance pattern in galexj1931 + 0117 and the absence of a close companion , as well as a comparison with other , similar cases such as the daz pg1015 + 161 support the likely presence of a dusty disc around galexj1931 + 0117 .",
