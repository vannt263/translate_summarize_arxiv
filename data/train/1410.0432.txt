    "the @xmath0msm ( neutrino minimal standard model )  @xcite is a simple extension of the standard model ( sm ) , explaining the origins of neutrino masses , dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe at the same time .",

    "enough baryon asymmetry can be generated even if the degenerate mass @xmath14 of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is as small as @xmath15  mev  @xcite .",

    "it is remarkable that , thanks to the smallness of masses , the heavy neutral leptons in the @xmath0msm , especially @xmath1 and @xmath2 , can be directly tested by a variety of experiments and/or observations  @xcite .",
    "these heavy neutral leptons mix with flavor neutrinos and their mixing elements are given by the ratios between dirac and majorana masses .",
    "it is then possible to produce @xmath8 by decays of various mesons through the mixing as the production of ordinary active neutrinos . as an example , when they are sufficiently lighter than charged kaon , the decays @xmath19 and @xmath20 are possible .",
    "in fact , these channels are good targets for direct search of heavy neutral leptons by using the technique of the so - called peak search experiment  @xcite .",

    "for instance , it is possible that the ratio of decay rates ( @xmath21 ) @xmath22 is significantly different from the sm prediction .",
    "although each partial decay width receives considerable hadronic uncertainties , the theoretical prediction can be very precise by taking the ratio , and thus @xmath23 offers a promising test for physics beyond the sm .",

    "the deviation strongly depends on masses and mixing elements of @xmath8 .",
    "the mixing elements @xmath24 of @xmath12 must be very suppressed in order to avoid various constraints of dark matter .",
