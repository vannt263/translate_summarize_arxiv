    "this lensed quasar sample is predicted to include about 20 of the very rare quad systems which will provide additional valuable information compared to pair systems for constraining lens models ( specifically extra constraints from 2 more positions and 2 more time delays ) , in particular for cosmology purposes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we have discovered and spectroscopically confirmed three lensed quasar pair systems @xcite in des . here in this letter",
    "we report the discovery and confirmation of the first lensed quasar quad ( or quad - like ) system , , in the dark energy survey .",
    "we first describe our lensed quasar search procedure , system discovery , and photometric data in  [ sec : search ] .",
    "we then describe our spectroscopic observations and present our data in  [ sec : spectra ] .",
    "we summarize and conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "detailed photometry analysis and lens modeling for this system are presented in a companion paper , @xcite , to which we will refer the reader where relevant below .",
    "the system  was discovered during a systematic visual search for candidate strong lensing systems in the dark energy survey year 1 ( y1 ) data @xcite .",
    "a number of different search methods have been applied to the des y1 data , but the specific method involved in this case was a `` blue - near - red '' technique , where we first automatically identified candidate systems of red galaxies with multiple neighboring blue objects within some radius , and then used visual inspections of these systems to rate them and to select the best candidates for subsequent spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "this method has been used previously in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data to search for bright strong lensing systems and then to confirm them spectroscopically with good success ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we started with a des y1 red galaxy sample selected using the redmagic technique @xcite .",
    "to minimize stellar contamination of this sample , we rejected objects with sextractor @xcite spread_model@xcite values  @xmath6 .",
    "we then identified as our initial set of candidates those redmagic galaxies with three or more blue objects within a radius @xmath7 , where we defined a blue object as one with colors @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we did not apply any star / galaxy separation cut to the blue objects , but did reject objects that are saturated in any of the @xmath10 filters using a sextractor flags  @xmath11 cut .",
    "we also applied a magnitude cut @xmath12 on the blue objects to keep the number of candidates manageable for the visual inspection step and to have relatively brighter candidates to ease follow - up spectroscopic redshift measurements .    applying the above criteria resulted in a list of 6526 systems that one of us ( hl ) then inspected visually by examining their des @xmath13 color composite images .",
    "the discovery image of  is shown in figure  [ fig : images ] , where we see a central red galaxy ( g1 ) surrounded by three blue objects ( a , b , and d ) and a fourth red object ( g2 ) ( objects labeled as in * ? ? ?",
    "this system stood out as a potential quadruply lensed quasar system , except that the fourth putative lensed quasar image has a conspicuously redder color than those of the other three images , suggesting that the fourth image may instead be that of a foregound red galaxy , which is possibly also associated with the central red lensing galaxy . here",
    "the system would be a triple , where two of the quad s images are blended into one due to a fold configuration .",
    "another possibility is that the fourth image is a blend of a foreground red galaxy with the fourth blue lensed quasar image , as the fourth image in figure  [ fig : images ] appears not as red as the central galaxy .",
    "regardless , the quad - like configuration of  made it a very good candidate for subsequent spectroscopy , described in the next section .",
    "we present a detailed lensing model for this system in the companion paper @xcite .    in the des y1 catalog ,  is composed of three objects due to the fact that components d and g1 are blended and that b and g2 are also blended .",
    "as such , the catalog contains entries from a , d+g1 , and b+g2 .",
    "the sextractor segmentation map for the system is shown in figure  [ fig : images ] , overplotted on the des @xmath14-band image of the system .",
    "we need to point out here that all three catalog objects actually meet our blue object color criteria given before ( see figure  [ fig : quadcolor ] , leftmost panel ) , so that the redmagic galaxy for this system is not g1 but rather the red galaxy g0 marked in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "g0 is about @xmath15 away from g1 and has a redmagic photometric redshift of @xmath16 , close to g1 s spectroscopic redshift of 0.597 ( see  [ sec : spectra ] ) .",
    "therefore in this case our blue - near - red method found the system via another red galaxy likely associated with the lensing galaxy , rather than directly via the red lensing galaxy itself .",
    "the discovery was thus likely not coincidental , but was also not by the direct route as intended by the method .",
    "in similar des y1 blue - near - red and related searches , we also see other cases in galaxy group and cluster environments where the lensing system is being indirectly found this way ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) .    the coordinates and photometry of the three des catalog objects",
    "are given in table  [ tab : phot ] , while we present in @xcite a more detailed analysis that provides the deblended positions and magnitudes of all five components in this system .",

    "we provide here a brief summary : ( 1 ) the gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) method of @xcite , which uses supervised machine learning in a five - dimensional optical plus infrared color space and identified  as a candidate pair ( d+g1 not found separately in @xmath18 band due to blending noted above ) ; ( 2 ) chitah @xcite , which uses pixel - based automatic recognition on @xmath4 cutout images and identified the system as a candidate pair ( not flagged as quad because fourth image g2 is too red ) ; and ( 3 ) the artificial neural network ( ann ) method of @xcite , which uses @xmath29 and @xmath30 magnitudes and identified   as a candidate extended quasar .",
    "figure  [ fig : quadcolor ] shows the positions of des catalog objects a , b+g2 , and d+g1 in the color space used by the gmm method , illustrating how the system was flagged as a candidate due to the quasar - like colors of its components .",
    "spectroscopic observations of  were carried out using the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos - s ) on the gemini south telescope , as part of a larger gemini large and long program ( llp ) ( pi e.  buckley - geer ; program ids gs-2015b - lp-5 , gs-2016a - lp-5 ) of spectroscopic follow - up for des strong lensing systems and for des photometric redshift ( photo - z ) calibrations .",

    "( another 38 slits were assigned to unrelated des photo - z calibration targets . ) two sets of spectra were taken : blue data using the b600 grating ( dispersion @xmath31    pixel@xmath32 ) and red data using the r400 grating ( dispersion @xmath33    pixel@xmath32 ) .",
    "we used 4@xmath34900 second exposures for cosmic ray rejection and processed the data using the iraf gemini reduction package .",

    ", we clearly see that all three blue images a , b , and d show strong quasar emission lines at the same redshift , specifically ly@xmath36",
    "1216  and civ 1549  in the blue spectra , and ciii ] 1909  and mgii 2800  in the red spectra .",
    "from the ciii ] line , which shows the cleanest , most symmetric line profile among these four broad emission features , we use the emsao task in the iraf external package rvsao @xcite to report a redshift @xmath1 for the quasar .    to compare the spectra of the three blue images in more detail ,",
    "we also show in figure  [ fig : spectra ] ( bottom panels ) the fractional differences between the blue and red spectra of images a and d relative to those of image b , which has the spectra with the most counts .",
    "we first rescale the spectra of a and d so that they each have the same median counts as those of b over the respective blue and red wavelength ranges plotted .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig : spectra ] show generally good agreement among the spectra , especially for the red spectra . for the blue spectra",
    ", we do see an overall slope for the spectrum of a relative to that of b ; we attribute this slope to extinction differences between the lines of sight to these two images , and/or to differences in atmospheric differential refraction between the two differently oriented slits ( figure  [ fig : images ] ) used to observe images a and b. in addition , we also see conspicuous differences between the spectra of d and b at the locations of the strong ly@xmath36 and civ emission lines , and to a lesser extent at the ciii ] line .",
    "we attribute these differences to the effects of microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy , manifested as flux ratio differences , in pairs of lensed quasar images , for the continuum vs.  the emission line regions in the spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent to these observations that confirmed the three blue images as having the same quasar redshift , we designed a second mos slit mask targeting the central lensing galaxy g1 and the fourth image g2 , each allocated to a single slit .",
    "the slits for g1 and g2 are shown in red in figure  [ fig : images ] ( bottom right ) .",
    "red r400 observations were obtained in the gemini south semester 2016a observing queue , on 9 apr 2016 , under @xmath37 seeing conditions and using the same observing setup as above .",
    "blue b600 observations were also put into the queue , but no data were obtained before the system set in 2016a .",
    "we show the r400 spectra in figure  [ fig : more_spectra ] , where we see that g2 shows broad ciii ] and mgii emission at the same redshift as found for the three blue images , while g1 shows ca h+k absorption lines , indicating that g1 is an early - type lensing galaxy with redshift @xmath2 .",
    "however , we also see that the g1 spectrum unexpectedly shows the same ciii ] emission line as in the lensed quasar spectra , leading us to suspect there is contaminating light from the neighboring lensed quasar image d , which is only about @xmath38 away ( cf .  the @xmath37 seeing ) .",
    "likewise , object b , the brightest quasar image , is only about @xmath37 away from the substantially fainter object g2 , suggesting that the ciii ] line seen in the g2 spectrum is similarly contamination from object b. using the image modeling code galfit @xcite , we simulate image b as a moffat profile with a fwhm of @xmath37 and find that about 12% of its light falls within the 1-wide slit and 2-long spectral extraction aperture used for g2 . though seemingly small",
    ", this 12% fraction actually amounts to about 80% of the @xmath24-band light from g2 itself , given that @xmath39 and @xmath40 from table  1 of @xcite .",
    "( we use @xmath24 band as the ciii ] line falls within that filter . )",
    "this estimated contamination is thus substantial and unfortunately we are unable to correct for it as image b lies off the slit for g2 ( figure  [ fig : images ] , bottom right ) and we do not have a concurrent spectrum of b. we thus can not rule out contamination from b as the source of the ciii ] line seen in the g2 spectrum ( likewise for d and g1 ) and will need future observations to verify whether g2 indeed shows quasar emission features or not .",
    "was identified as a candidate lensed quasar quad system from the des first - year data .",
    "subsequent follow - up spectroscopy confirmed the three bright blue objects in this system to be the images of a quasar at redshift @xmath1 , lensed by an early - type red galaxy with redshift @xmath2 .",
    "another reddened object in the system , possibly a blend of a perturbing galaxy and the fourth lensed quasar image , was also observed spectroscopically , though without conclusive results .",
    "our companion paper @xcite presents a detailed model of the system , from which we expect the longest time delay in the system to be about 80 days , making  well suited @xcite for time delay measurements , which we are undertaking via a monitoring campaign within the strides collaboration .",
    "the lensing model also constrains the mass of the possible perturbing galaxy and thus provides information about substructure in the lensing mass distribution .",
    "further spectroscopic follow - up and high resolution imaging data should provide more needed details about the main lensing galaxy and its environment .",
    "we thus expect this quad system to be particularly useful for the application of time delay cosmography ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
