    "consider a @xmath0-parameter analytic family of analytic plane vector fields @xmath1 , @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 has a @xmath4-saddle cycle ( a hyperbolic @xmath4-graphic ) @xmath5 , as on fig.[cycles ] .",
    "the cyclicity @xmath6 of @xmath5 is , roughly speaking , the maximal number of limit cycles of @xmath1 which tend to @xmath5 as @xmath7 .",
    "the first results on the cyclicity of one - saddle connection ( also called homoclinic connection ) go back to andronov and leontovich in 1937 ( but they were published only in 1959 @xcite ) .",
    "the cyclicity @xmath8 has been studied later in full generality by roussarie @xcite , see also @xcite for an extensive list of references .",
    "the main technical tool of the roussarie s method is an asymptotic expansion of the dulac map ( transport map near the saddle point ) @xmath9 in terms of @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the so called ecalle - roussarie compensator @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the trace of the vector field @xmath1 at the saddle point .",
    "let @xmath14 be the poincar first return map , associated to @xmath15 and @xmath1 .",
    "the most delicate case to be studied is when @xmath15 is of infinite co - dimension ( @xmath16 ) . for @xmath17 the map @xmath14",
    "is composed by a dulac map ( near the saddle point ) and an analytic map ( the transport map along the homoclinic orbit ) .",
    "the usual derivation - division algorithm then provides an upper bound for the cyclicity in terms of the number of the coefficients of the asymptotic series of the displacement map @xmath18 , which vanish as @xmath19 .",
    "the same method was applied more recently to one - parameter deformations of hamiltonian two - saddle loops ( called also heteroclinic hamiltonian connections ) , under the non - generic assumption that one of the separatrices of @xmath20 remains unbroken @xcite .",
    "recall that a @xmath4-saddle cycle @xmath5 is said to be hamiltonian , provided that there is a neighborhood of @xmath5 in which @xmath3 allows an analytic first integral with only morse critical points .    _",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend these results to the case of an arbitrary analytic perturbation of a hamiltonian two - loop @xmath20 , having two hyperbolic equilibrium points .",
    "_    our approach is different , as we do not use the asymptotic series of the corresponding dulac maps @xmath21 and @xmath22 , shown on fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "recall that in the one - parameter case @xmath23 , the displacement function @xmath24 can be approximated by an appropriate abelian integral @xmath25 ( or more generally , an iterated path integral ) depending on a parameter @xmath26 as follows @xmath27 therefore to count the zeros of @xmath24 ( corresponding to limit cycles ) it is enough to count the zeros of @xmath25 , which can be done by making use of the so called `` petrov trick '' ( based on the argument principle ) , see @xcite and the references given there .",
    "the above considerations hold true at least far from the singular points of the vector field @xmath1 .",
    "as discovered in @xcite , however , not all limit cycles in a neighborhood of a two - saddle loop can be approximated in such a way .",
    "the missing `` alien '' limit cycles are moreover non - avoidable in generic @xmath0-parameter deformations @xmath1 with @xmath28 .",
    "for this reason , we apply the argument principle directly to the displacement map @xmath29 in an appropriate complex domain , in order to obtain an estimate to the number of its complex zeros ( corresponding to complex limit cycles ) .",
    "the main technical result of the paper is lemma [ mainlemma ] , which claims that the zero locus of the imaginary part of the dulac map is a real analytic curve of @xmath30 at the origin .",
    "this makes possible to investigate the number of the zeros of the imaginary part of @xmath31 along the zero locus of the imaginary part of @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , the intersection numbers of two analytic curves is easily computed .",
    "the proof of our main result , theorem [ main ] , is then completed by making use of the petrov trick .    in the course of the proof of theorem [ main ] we assume , for the sake of simplicity , that our deformations depend on a single small parameter @xmath32 .",
    "general multi - parameter deformations @xmath33 of @xmath3 are then studied along the same lines , as it follows from the hironaka s desingularization theorem .",
