    "observations of type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite all indicate the existence of dark energy ( de ) driving the current accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "the most obvious theoretical candidate of de is the cosmological constant @xmath0 , but it is plagued with the fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "there are also many dynamical de models , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , @xmath3-essence @xcite , cpl @xcite , tachyon @xcite , hessence @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , holographic @xcite , agegraphic @xcite , holographic ricci @xcite , yang - mills condensate @xcite , etc .",
    "although numerous theoretical models have been proposed in the past decade , the nature of de still remains a mystery .    in recent years",
    ", the numerical study of de , i.e. utilizing cosmological observations to constrain de models , has become one of the most active fields in the modern cosmology @xcite .",
    "although today there are many observational methods , snia is still one of the most powerful tools to probe the mysterious de . in the past decade , many snia datasets , such as gold04 @xcite , gold06 @xcite , snls @xcite , essence @xcite , davis @xcite , have been released , while the number and quality of snia have continually increased .",
    "the most recent snia datasets are `` union '' @xcite and `` constitution '' @xcite , and they have been widely used in the literature @xcite . however , these snia datasets are not always consistent with other types of cosmological observations , and are even in tension with other snia samples . for examples , in @xcite ,",
    "the gold04 dataset was shown to be inconsistent with the snls dataset : the snls dataset favors the @xmath0cdm model , while the gold04 dataset favors the dynamical de model . in @xcite , by comparing the maximum likelihood fits of the cpl parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) given by different snia samples , nesseris and perivolaropoulos found that the gold06 dataset is also in @xmath6 tension with the snls dataset .",
    "moreover , they also investigated how to remove this tension .",
    "the method is simple .",
    "first , they fitted the @xmath0cdm model to the whole 182 snia in the gold06 dataset , and obtained the best - fit parameter value of @xmath0cdm model ( for snia data only ) .",
    "then , they calculated the relative deviation to the best - fit @xmath0cdm prediction , @xmath7 , for all the 182 data points . here",
    "@xmath8 is the observational value of distance modulus , @xmath9 is the theoretical value of distance modulus given by the best - fit @xmath0cdm model , and @xmath10 is the 1@xmath11 error of distance modulus . by searching the snia samples satisfying @xmath12 , they isolated six snia that are mostly responsible for the tension .",
    "further , by using the random truncation method , they demonstrated that these 6 snia are systematically different from the gold06 dataset .    in a recent work , by comparing the maximum likelihood fits of the cpl parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , wei @xcite pointed out that both union and constitution dataset are also in tension with the observations of cmb and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) . moreover , he also investigated how to remove these tensions . by using the method of truncation of @xcite",
    ", wei found out the main sources that are responsible for the tensions : for the union set , there are 21 snia differing from the best - fit @xmath0cdm prediction beyond @xmath13 ( i.e. @xmath14 ) ; and for the constitution set , there are 34 snia differing from the best - fit @xmath0cdm prediction beyond @xmath13 .",
    "the specific limit of truncation ( i.e. @xmath13 ) is chosen based on two considerations : first , the tension between snia samples and other observations can be completely removed ; second , the number of usable snia can be preserved as much as possible ( see @xcite for details ) . by subtracting these outliers from the union dataset and the constitution dataset , respectively , two new snia datasets , `` uniont '' and `` constitutiont '' ( `` t '' stands for `` truncated '' ) ,",
    "were obtained .",
    "further , wei argued that the uniont and the constitutiont datasets are fully consistent with the other cosmological observations , and should be used to constrain various de models .",
    "but in @xcite , only the @xmath0cdm model is used to select the outliers from the union and the constitution dataset . since",
    "different de models may select different outliers , one may doubt whether the approach adopted in @xcite is valid . in principle , the truncation procedure should be performed for each different de model . only if the impact of different models is negligible , one can conclude that the conclusion of wei is correct .",
    "so in the present work , we shall consider 10 different models .",
    "the truncation procedure will be performed for all these 10 models , and the corresponding cosmological consequences will be explored .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly describe 10 theoretical models considered in this work . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the method of data analysis , as well as the snia datasets we used in this paper . by performing the truncation procedure of @xcite for 10 different models ,",
    "we demonstrate that the approach adopted in @xcite is valid . in section 4",

    "first , we discuss three kinds of two - parameter models : the xcdm model , the cg model , and the hde model .",
    "as seen in table [ table3 ] , the @xmath119 of these 3 models given by the combined constitution+bao+cmb data are 466.947 , 466.891 , and 467.384 , respectively .",
    "that is to say , after taking into account the cmb data , the differences of the @xmath119 of these 3 models are still smaller than 1 .",

    "as seen in table [ table3 ] , the @xmath119 of these 3 models given by the combined constitution+bao+cmb data are 466.910 , 466.902 , 466.895 , respectively , and the differences of the @xmath119 of these 3 models are even smaller than 0.1 .",
    "since this result also holds true in table [ table1 ] , table [ table2 ] , and table [ table4 ] , it is also very difficult to distinguish these 3 models . therefore ,",
    "to distinguish de models better , more high - quality observational data are needed .",
    "in this work , by performing the truncation procedure of @xcite for 10 different models , we demonstrate that the approach adopted in @xcite is valid .",
    "moreover , by using the 4 snia datasets mentioned above , as well as the observations of cmb and bao , we perform best - fit analysis on the 10 de models . it is found that : ( 1 ) for each de model , the truncated snia datasets not only greatly reduce @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but also remove the tension between snia data and other cosmological observations . ( 2 ) the cmb data is very helpful to break the degeneracy among different parameters , and plays a very important role in distinguishing different de models .
