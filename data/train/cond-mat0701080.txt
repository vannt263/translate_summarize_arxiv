    "it is known since more than 40 years that chromium spinels ( @xmath2cr@xmath0x@xmath1 ) span an enormous range of magnetic exchange strengths and different magnetic ground states  @xcite . as a function of lattice constant , or equivalently as a function of cr - cr separation , these compounds are characterized by curie - weiss temperatures from -400  k to 200  k and , at low temperatures , reveal either complex antiferromagnetism or ferromagnetism .",
    "the chromium oxide - spinels undergo antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering transitions of order 10  k , despite the fact that the exchange interactions , as deduced from the paramagnetic curie - weiss ( cw ) temperatures , are one order of magnitude larger .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the cr spins reside on a pyrochlore lattice revealing strong geometrical frustration .",
    "some selenide spinels undergo ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering at temperatures of the order of 100  k. the different ground states as a function of lattice constants are driven by the dominating exchange interactions : at small cr - cr separation strong direct afm exchange dominates . with increasing separation",
    "the 90@xmath3 fm cr-@xmath4-cr exchange becomes important .",
    "probably for all lattice spacings a complex cr-@xmath4-@xmath2-@xmath4-cr super exchange ( se ) is active .",
    "this antiferromagnetic se is weak and only of the order of 1  k , but gains importance via a high multiplicity @xcite . in the spinel structure ,",
    "cr ions are located at the b - sites in an octahedral environment in a @xmath5 state . under the action of an octahedral crystal field the @xmath6 levels split into a lower @xmath7 triplet ,",
    "each orbital being singly occupied , and an excited empty @xmath8 doublet .",
    "the resulting bulk material is a mott insulator with @xmath9 , with an almost spherical charge distribution and negligible spin - orbit coupling . as a matter of fact",
    ", one can expect that in these compounds orbital effects are quenched , and that charge effects will play no role .",
    "the geometric frustration of the pyrochlore lattice and the bond frustration due to competing magnetic exchange  @xcite are responsible for emergent complex magnetic ground states  @xcite , for strong metamagnetism  @xcite , and even for multiferroic behaviour  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the ground states becomes even enhanced by the unconventional coupling of the spin - only chromium moments to the lattice .",
    "this has early been recognized on the basis of ultrasonic experiments on zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 by kino and lthi  @xcite and later on , has been treated in modern theories on the basis of a spin - driven jahn - teller effect  @xcite .",
    "very recently , spin - phonon coupling in materials with strong electronic correlations gained considerable attention .",
    "concerning the compounds under consideration , the onset of structural distortions and of afm order in the geometrically frustrated oxides has been described using a concept , in which the lattice distorts to gain exchange energy and thereby relieves the frustration  @xcite . in zncr@xmath0s@xmath1 complex magnetic order results from strong bond - frustration characterised by ferromagnetic fm and afm exchange interactions of almost equal strength  @xcite .",
    "zncr@xmath0se@xmath1 is dominated by fm exchange but orders antiferromagnetically at @xmath10  k  @xcite .",
    "all these compounds show a strong splitting of specific phonon modes  @xcite , which has been explained by ab - initio approaches providing evidence that the dynamic anisotropy of the phonon modes is induced by the magnetic exchange interactions alone and can be fully decoupled from lattice distortions  @xcite .",
    "the idea that magnetic exchange interactions and the onset of magnetic order strongly influence the phonon modes has been outlined already decades ago by baltensperger and helman  @xcite and by bresch and dambrogio  @xcite .",

    "it immediately becomes clear , that with increasing lattice constant the cw temperatures increase from strongly negative afm exchange in the oxides to moderately fm exchange in the selenides .",
    "as outlined above , in the oxides afm direct cr - cr exchange is dominating all other exchange paths . with increasing lattice constant",
    "this direct exchange becomes considerably weaker and competes with 90@xmath3 fm cr-@xmath4-cr exchange .",

    "the onset of afm order is strongly reduced by geometrical frustration and in the low - temperature paramagnetic phase afm fluctuations dominate the physics of theses compounds .",
    "fm order becomes suppressed by the onset of competing afm interactions and below the hypothetical ordering temperature fm fluctuations control the low - temperature physics . in between these two lines with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the paramagnetic ( pm ) regime extends to low temperatures because of bond frustration : here fm exchange and afm cr-@xmath4-@xmath2-@xmath4-cr exchange , enhanced by residues of direct exchange , are of equal strength .",
    "it is important to note that even for a vanishing cw temperature local exchange interactions are still strong but compete and almost cancel out each other . in the cone between these two lines of expected magnetic order",
    "strong bond frustration is active , exemplified by the paramagnetic behaviour of zcs , which reveals a cw temperature of almost 0  k and a mixed magnetic state at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "bond frustration still seems to be active for compounds with high fm curie - weiss temperatures , which exhibit antiferromagnetism at low temperatures .",
    "finally we would like to notice , that the spiral ground state in zcse has been explained assuming a set of five distinct distant - neighbour interactions  @xcite .",
    "a closer inspection of table  1 and figure  1 allows further deep insights into the dominating exchange paths : it is clear that the antiferromagnetic exchange at small lattice constants , which is due to direct cr - cr overlap , becomes exponentially smaller with increasing lattice spacings .",
    "however , it remains unclear why the ferromagnetic exchange strongly increases towards larger lattice constants .",
    "table  1 shows that the lattice constants increase from 1.050  nm to 1.074  nm , when moving from zcse towards ccse and hcse , but the cw temperatures increase from 90  k to 200  k and the ferromagnetic ordering temperatures raise from 21  k to 130  k. the low ordering temperature for the zcse can partly be explained by bond frustration , but it is hard to believe that antiferromagnetic order via cr-@xmath4-@xmath2-@xmath4-cr depends so strongly on distance .",
    "the ferromagnetic exchange should mainly depend on the cr-@xmath4-cr bond angle , which is 90@xmath3 in the ideal spinel structure .",
    "this bond angle strongly depends on the fractional coordinate @xmath20  @xcite . from table  1",
    "we conclude that , as @xmath20 is almost constant for the ferromagnets under consideration , it can not explain the difference in the fm exchange interactions , and one can speculate that the increase in ferromagnetic exchange rather comes from an increasing covalency of the cr-@xmath4-cr bonds when moving from the sulfides to the selenides .",

    "also single crystals have been grown by gas transport using chlorine as transport agent or by liquid - transport methods .",

    "x - ray diffraction revealed cubic single - phase materials with lattice constants and anion fractional coordinates as indicated in table  1 .",
    "magnetic susceptibilities were measured with a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer for temperatures from 1.8  k to 400  k. curie - weiss temperatures and paramagnetic moments are included in table  1 .",
    "reflectivity experiments were carried out in the far - infrared range using the bruker fourier - transform spectrometer ifs113v equipped with a he bath cryostat . with our setup of mirrors and detectors",
    "we were able to measure the frequency range from 50 to 650  @xmath21 .",
    "the ceramic samples were pressed with a maximal pressure of 1  gpa . nevertheless , neither surface nor the density of the ceramics was ideal and of perfect optical quality . to correct for these factors we multiplied the measured reflectivities of the ceramic samples cco , zco , zcs and hcs by a factor of 1.2 .",
    "this factor has been derived from a set of measurements of different sulfide- and selenide - spinels at room temperature in ceramic and single - crystalline form .",
    "the measurements on pressed ceramics hence limits the precision of the value of @xmath22 and concomitantly of the dielectric strength .",
    "but the absolute errors will be certainly less than 10% and will not affect the variation of the derived parameters as a function of temperature and external magnetic field .",

    "the frustration in all compounds , geometric as well as bond frustration , seems to be released by a spin - driven jahn - teller effect  @xcite , inducing lattice anomalies and strong symmetry breaking in the dynamic variables . in this report we presented a detailed study of the phonon properties in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states .",
    "we observed strong shifts of the eigenfrequencies and characteristic splittings of the phonon modes , which are different for the different order of the magnetic moments .",
    "frequency shifts and mode splitting are compared for all compounds and are related to a spin - correlation function of nearest neighbour spins . moreover , the temperature dependence of the splittings and shifts seem to follow the sublattice magnetisation in the ordered compounds .",
    "this seems to be best documented for zncr@xmath0s@xmath1 , which shows a splitting of all modes below @xmath37 ( green symbols in panels ( a)-(d ) ) .",
    "but for some modes , short - range order effects extending to temperatures far above @xmath37 are clearly observed .",
    "positive and negative shifts can be related to dominating fm and afm exchange acting on specific bonds , which are actively involved in the ir - active modes .",
    "finally , we also analyzed the intensity of the different modes and found , as expected from simple electronegativity considerations , decreasing mode intensities when moving from the oxide over the sulphide to the selenides .",
    "this decreasing mode intensities signal an increasing covalency of the bonds , with cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 being strongly ionic , while zncr@xmath0se@xmath1 being predominantly covalent bonded .",
