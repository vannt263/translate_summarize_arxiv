    "a closed and oriented 3-manifold @xmath1 which is described by a plumbing tree @xmath2 of oriented circle bundles over @xmath3 , all having euler numbers less than or equal to @xmath4 , admits many stein fillable contact structures . a kirby diagram of @xmath1 is given by a collection of unknotted circles in @xmath5 corresponding to the vertices of @xmath2 , linked with respect to the edges of @xmath2 so that the smooth framing of a circle in the diagram is exactly the euler number @xmath6 corresponding to the circle bundle it represents .",
    "to find stein fillable contact structures on @xmath1 one can simply put all the circles into legendrian position ( with respect to the standard contact structure in @xmath5 ) in such a way that the contact framing , i.e. , the thurston - bennequin number @xmath7 of a circle @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 .",
    "then by applying legendrian surgery on these legendrian circles in @xmath5 we get a stein fillable contact structure on @xmath1 .",
    "note that , the freedom to legendrian realize each @xmath8 with different rotation numbers ( but fixing @xmath10 ) will enable us to find different stein fillable contact structures on @xmath1 .",
    "we will call a plumbing tree  non - positive \" if @xmath11 for every vertex @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the degree of the @xmath12-th vertex",

    "a planar open book supporting the contact structure obtained by a legendrian realization of a non - positive plumbing tree was presented in @xcite . in this article",
    "we will generalize the methods in @xcite to find an open book supporting the contact structure obtained by a legendrian realization of a plumbing tree which is not necessarily non - positive .",
    "the genus of the open book we will construct for a tree @xmath2 is given by a number @xmath15 , which we define in section  [ sec : surg ] .",
    "as a preliminary step in the construction of the open books we first derive special legendrian surgery diagrams for @xmath1 in section  [ sec : surg ] . in the following section",
    "we show how to realize these legendrian surgery diagrams on the pages of an open book for @xmath16 thus after legendrian surgery we have an open book supporting the desired contact structure .",
    "we also discuss how to apply these ideas to more general contact surgery diagrams . these constructions lead to open books decompositions supporting all tight contact structures on small seifert fibered spaces with @xmath17 having page genus zero or one . in the last section we exhibit various examples of our construction .",
    "suppose that for an oriented link @xmath18 in a closed and oriented 3manifold @xmath1 the complement @xmath19 fibers over the circle as @xmath20 such that @xmath21 is the interior of a compact surface bounding @xmath18 , for all @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath23 is called an _ open book decomposition _ ( or just an _ open book _ ) of @xmath1 . for each @xmath22 , the surface @xmath24",

    "the monodromy of the fibration @xmath25 is defined as the diffeomorphism of a fixed page which is given by the first return map of a flow that is transverse to the pages and meridional near the binding .",
    "the isotopy class of this diffeomorphism is independent of the chosen flow and we will refer to that as the _ monodromy _ of the open book decomposition .",
    "an open book @xmath23 on a 3manifold @xmath1 is said to be _ isomorphic _ to an open book @xmath26 on a 3manifold @xmath27 , if there is a diffeomorphism @xmath28 such that @xmath29 on @xmath30 .",
    "in other words , an isomorphism of open books takes binding to binding and pages to pages .",
    "an open book can also be described as follows .",

    "thus we get a closed @xmath46-manifold @xmath47 equipped with an open book decomposition whose binding is the union of the core circles @xmath45 s that we glue to @xmath38 to obtain @xmath1 . in conclusion ,",
    "an element @xmath48 determines a @xmath46-manifold together with an  abstract \" open book decomposition on it .",

    "if we use a left - handed dehn twist instead then we call the result a _ negative stabilization_. the inverse of the above process is called _ positive _ ( _ negative _ ) _ destabilization_. notice that although the resulting monodromy depends on the chosen curve @xmath58 , the 3manifold specified by @xmath61 is diffeomorphic to the 3manifold specified by @xmath62",

    "we describe legendrian surgery diagrams of some contact structures on plumbings of circle bundles over @xmath3 according to trees which are not necessarily non - positive .",
    "these surgery diagrams will be transformed into open books in the following section .",

    "then take a maximal linear subtree @xmath75 which includes at last one bad vertex of @xmath76 it is clear that by iterating this process we will end up with a subtree @xmath77 without any bad vertices , for some disjoint subtrees @xmath78 such that @xmath79 , for @xmath80 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath81 may not be uniquely determined by @xmath2 . in particular , given any tree @xmath2 , the number @xmath82 above is not uniquely determined .",
    "nevertheless there is certainly a minimum @xmath82 , associated to @xmath2 , over all possible choices of subtrees in the above process .",
    "we will refer to this number as the _ genus _ of @xmath2 and denote it by @xmath15 .",
    "if there is no bad vertex in @xmath2 then we define @xmath15 to be zero .",
    "[ surg ] suppose that we are given a plumbing tree @xmath2 of @xmath83 circle bundles @xmath84 such that @xmath85 for all @xmath12 .",
    "there are @xmath86 special legendrian surgery diagrams giving stein manifolds with boundary @xmath66 these all have different @xmath87 s so the associated stein fillable contact structures are distinct .",
    "_ we do not claim these are all possible stein fillable contact structures on @xmath88 but in some cases ( like when @xmath89 is a small seifert fibered space with @xmath90 ) we do construct all stein fillable ( and all tight ) contact structures .",
    "this follows from the classification of tight contact structures in @xcite . _",
    "_ there are other , possibly more obvious , legendrian surgery diagrams for these contact structures on @xmath88 but the diagrams we derive here are the key to our constructions of open books in the next section . _    from @xcite we recall how to `` roll up '' a linear plumbing tree @xmath76 let @xmath2 be the linear plumbing tree for @xmath91 where each @xmath84 is plumbed to @xmath92 and @xmath93 see the left hand side of figure  [ rolledup ] .",
    "the standard surgery diagram for @xmath2 is a chain of unknots @xmath94 with each @xmath95 simply linking @xmath96 and @xmath97 and with @xmath95 having framing @xmath98 we think of this chain as horizontal with components labeled from left to right .",
    "let @xmath99 start with @xmath100 and slide it over @xmath101 to get a new link with @xmath100 replaced by an unknot @xmath102 that now links @xmath103 @xmath104 times .",
    "now slide @xmath105 over @xmath106 continue in this way until @xmath107 is slid over @xmath108 the new link @xmath18 is called the  rolled up \" surgery diagram .",
    "see the right hand side of figure  [ rolledup ] .",
    "we observe a few salient features of this construction .",
    "first , each @xmath109 links @xmath110 for @xmath111 the same number of times .",
    "denote this linking number by @xmath112 secondly , @xmath113 for all @xmath114 ( recall @xmath115 is negative . ) in fact , @xmath116 thirdly , the framings @xmath117 on the @xmath109 s are non - increasing and decrease only when @xmath118 in fact , @xmath119 fourthly , the meridians @xmath120 for @xmath95 simple link @xmath121 and",
    "lastly , @xmath18 sits in an unknotted solid torus neighborhood of @xmath122 there is an obvious legendrian representation of @xmath18 such that @xmath123 is the legendrian push off of @xmath124 with @xmath125 stabilizations .",
    "thus legendrian surgery produces exactly the number of stein manifolds claimed in the statement of the theorem .    returning to the topological situation",
    "consider a tree @xmath2 with one valence three vertex , then we can decompose @xmath2 as above into linear trees @xmath126 and @xmath127 where the first sphere bundle of @xmath128 is plumbed into the @xmath12-th sphere bundle of @xmath129 let @xmath130 and @xmath131 be the rolled up surgery links for @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively .",
    "it is clear that if the neighborhood of @xmath132 in which @xmath133 sits is identified with a neighborhood of the meridian @xmath120 for @xmath95 then the resulting surgery link will describe @xmath66 as above we can legendrian realize @xmath134 and @xmath135 moreover , if @xmath136 then there will be a zig - zag from the stabilization of @xmath109 and we may link @xmath133 into @xmath109 using this zig - zag as shown in figure  [ li ] .    if @xmath137 then there is no zig - zag and no apparent way to hook @xmath133 to @xmath138 however we can preform a type 1 legendrian reidemeister move to create a cusp edge that can be used to hook @xmath133 to @xmath139 as shown in figure  [ li ] .",
    "thus we have legendrian realized @xmath140 and have the desired number of stein fillings of @xmath66    we can continue in this way to obtain rolled up surgery diagrams and legendrian surgery diagrams for any plumbing tree .",
    "note that we will need to add @xmath141 type 1 legendrian reidemeister moves to each legendrian knot corresponding to a bad vertex .",
    "using the notation established at the beginning of section  [ sec : surg ] we are ready to state our main result .    [ tree ] suppose that we are given a plumbing tree @xmath2 of circle bundles @xmath84 such that @xmath85 for all @xmath12 .",
    "then the legendrian realizations of @xmath142 from proposition  [ surg ] give rise to stein fillable contact structures that are supported by open books of genus @xmath15 .",
    "this theorem was proven in @xcite for the case with no bad vertices ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "we generalize the ideas there for our current proof .    _ in @xcite it was shown that if a contact structure is filled by a symplectic 4-manifold whose intersection pairing does not embed in a negative definite form then the contact structure can not be supported by a planar open book .",
    "we observe that the intersection forms of some plumbings can embed in negative definite forms but the above theorem still gives an open book with genus larger than zero .",
    "for example if a plumbing graph has one bad vertex with euler number @xmath143 and valence @xmath144 where @xmath83 is the number of branches from the bad vertex with length greater than 1 , then the intersection form of this plumbing can embed into a negative definite form .",
    "it would be very interesting to see if the genus of these open books can indeed be reduced .",

    "see for example @xcite , this algorithm seems to produce much smaller genus open books .",
    "we demonstrate this by constructing an open book for each tight contact structure on small seifert fibered spaces with @xmath145 for notation see @xcite .",

    "if we roll up the rest of the @xmath185 s onto the @xmath184 s , as in the proof of proposition  [ surg ] , we can easily modify the proof of theorem  [ tree ] to construct a genus zero open book for these contact structures .",
    "the @xmath186 follows similarly , the only difference with the @xmath187 case is that @xmath188 will be @xmath189 thus we will not be able to stabilize the knot corresponding to @xmath190 however when one `` rolls up '' the @xmath191 s on @xmath188 we will still be able to realize them on the page of the open book . thus we still get a genus zero open book .",
    "the sporadic examples with @xmath192 follow from the classification of tight contact structures given in @xcite and using the methods in the proof of theorem  [ tree ] to convert the contact structure diagrams in that paper to open books .",

    "( note that in terms of contact structures this corresponds a legendrian surgery . )",
    "the monodromy of the open book in @xmath5 with page @xmath196 ( as shown in figure  [ 235 ] ) is @xmath198 .",
    "this is obtained by stabilizing the annulus carrying the curve @xmath199 in figure  [ 235 ] by attaching the 1handle carrying the curve @xmath200 .",

    "the monodromy of the elliptic fibration @xmath204 can be given by @xmath205 , using the notation in figure  [ 235 ] , except that we think of the curves @xmath200 and @xmath199 embedded on a non - punctured torus . by removing the union of a section and a cusp fiber from @xmath206 we get a lefschetz fibration on the 4manifold @xmath207 with punctured torus fibers whose monodromy is @xmath208 .",
    "one can check that @xmath209 is diffeomorphic to @xmath194 by kirby calculus ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "thus there is an induced open book on @xmath194 with monodromy @xmath208 . since the monodromy of this open book is a product of right - handed dehn twists only , the contact structure supported by this open book is stein fillable ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and in fact @xmath207 is a stein filling of its boundary .",
    "we conclude that the elliptic open book with monodromy @xmath208 has to support the unique tight contact structure on @xmath194 .",
    "finally we note that the two elliptic open books we described above are in fact isomorphic . in order to see the isomorphism we first observe that @xmath210 .",
    "then we plug this relation into @xmath211 to get @xmath212 note that we used the  braid \" relation @xmath213 repeatedly and cyclically permuted the words in the calculation above .      then applying our algorithm",
    "we can construct an open book supporting the contact structure obtained by the ( unique ) legendrian realization of this plumbing diagram .",
    "the page @xmath214 of the open book is a torus with two boundary components and the monodromy is given by @xmath215 which is equivalent to the more symmetric form @xmath216 where we depicted the curves @xmath217 and @xmath201 on @xmath214 in figure  [ page5vertex ] .",
    "note that dehn twists along two disjoint curves commute .",
    "moreover , by plugging in @xmath218 we can also express the monodromy as @xmath219      in this final example we will illustrate how to build open books corresponding to a tree with two subtrees , each containing a bad vertex , meeting at a bad vertex . as the first subtree @xmath126 take the linear tree on top with five vertices with a bad vertex in the second and fourth place , and as the second subtree",
    "take @xmath128 the subtree of @xmath220 branching from the left most bad vertex on @xmath129 notice that in the rolled - up version the part corresponding to @xmath128 is  linked \" to the part corresponding to @xmath126 .",
    "so we start with the open book for @xmath126 and make sure the open book has been stabilized twice so that @xmath128 and the top most vertex can be linked into @xmath129 then @xmath128 is put on the pages of the open book . to this end",
    "we must stabilize again to accommodate the bad vertex in @xmath174 the resulting open book has page as shown in figure  [ plumb ] .",
    "in particular , it is a surface of genus two with one boundary component .",
    "the monodromy of the open book supporting the contact structure obtained by legendrian surgery on the legendrian realization of @xmath2 is then given by @xmath221    the careful reader might have noticed that there is in fact a maximal linear subtree of @xmath2 including both bad vertices ( i.e. , @xmath222 ) and using that as the initial subtree we could construct a genus one open book ( with two binding components ) supporting the same contact structure . however , we wanted to illustrate how to build an open book corresponding to a tree with two subtrees , each containing a bad vertex , that meet at a bad vertex .",
