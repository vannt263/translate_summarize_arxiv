    ", we present a comprehensive photometric study of vdbh1 , 10 , 31 , 72 , 87 , 92 and 118 ; the last four clusters were discovered by @xcite .",
    "as far as we are aware , previous photometric studies were performed for vdbh 1 ( = haffner7 ) , 10 (= ruprecht35 ) and 31 (= ruprecht60 ) @xcite . in section 2",
    "we describe the collection and reduction of the available photometric data and their thorough treatment in order to build extensive and reliable data sets .",
    "the cluster structural and fundamental parameters are derived from star counts and colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams as described in section 3 .",

    "the nights were of photometric quality with a typical seeing of 1.1@xmath12 .",
    "the data sets used in this work were downloaded from the public website of the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) science data management ( sdm ) archives.the log of the observations is presented in table  [ tab : table1 ] , where the main astrometric and observational information is summarized .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note : to convert 1 arcsec to pc , we use the following expression,10@xmath1110@xmath13sin(1/3600 ) , where @xmath14 is the true distance modulus .",
    "we used the mean cluster radii to extract the cluster colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "they account for the luminosity function , colour distribution and stellar density of the stars distributed along the cluster line of sights , so that we statistically cleaned the cmds before using them to estimate the cluster fundamental parameters .",
    "we employed the cleaning procedure developed by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "see their fig .",
    "the method compares the extracted cluster cmd to distinct cmds composed of stars located reasonably far from the object , but not too far so as to risk losing the local field - star signature in terms of stellar density , luminosity function and/or colour distribution .",
    "here we chose four field regions , each one designed to cover an equal area as that of the cluster , and placed around the cluster .",
    "note that the four selected fields could not adequately represent the fore / background of the cluster if the extinction varies significantly accross the field of view .",
    "comparisons of field and cluster cmds have long been done by comparing the numbers of stars counted in boxes distributed in a similar manner throughout both cmds . however , since some parts of the cmd are more densely populated than others , counting the numbers of stars within boxes of a fixed size is not universally efficient .",
    "for instance , to deal with stochastic effects at relatively bright magnitudes ( e.g. , fluctuations in the numbers of bright stars ) , larger boxes are required , while populous cmd regions can be characterized using smaller boxes .",
    "thus , the use of boxes of different sizes distributed in the same manner throughout both cmds leads to a more meaningful comparison of the numbers of stars in different cmd regions .",
    "precisely , the procedure of @xcite carries out the comparison between field - star and cluster cmds by using boxes which vary their sizes from one place to another throughout the cmd and are centred on the positions of every star found in the field - star cmd .    by starting with reasonably large boxes  typically ( @xmath15(magnitude),@xmath15(colour ) ) = ( 1.00 , 0.50 ) mag  centred on each star in the four field cmds and by subsequently reducing their sizes until they reach the stars closest to the boxes centres in magnitude and colour , separately , we defined boxes which result in use of larger areas in field cmd regions containing a small number of stars , and vice versa .",
    "note that the definition of the position and size of each box involves two field stars , one at the centre of the box and another -the closest one to box centre - placed on the boundary of that box .",
    "next , we plotted all these boxes for each field cmd on the cluster cmd and subtracted the star located closest to each box centre .",
    "since we repeated this task for each of the four field cmd box samples , we could assign a membership probability to each star in the cluster cmd .",
    "this was done by counting the number of times a star remained unsubtracted in the four cleaned cluster cmds and by subsequently dividing this number by four .",
    "thus , we distinguished field populations projected on to the cluster area , i.e. , those stars with a probability @xmath16 @xmath17 25% ; stars that could equally likely be associated with either the field or the object of interest ( @xmath16 = 50% ) ; and stars that are predominantly found in the cleaned cluster cmds ( @xmath18 75% ) rather than in the field - star cmds . statistically speaking ,",
    "a certain amount of cleaning residuals is expected , which depends on the degree of variability of the stellar density , luminosity function and colour distribution of the field stars .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] illustrates the performance of the cleaning procedure in the field of vdbh72 , where we plotted three different ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) cmds : a single field - star cmd ( top left - hand panel ) for a circular region with an area equal to that of the cluster ; that for the stars located within the cluster radius ( bottom left - hand panel ) ; and the cleaned cluster cmd ( bottom right - hand panel ) for stars with @xmath21 25% ( pink ) , @xmath22 50% ( light blue ) and @xmath21 75% ( dark blue ) . in the field - star cmd we overplotted the boxes generated by the cleaning procedure . a schematic finding chart with a circle of radius equal to the cluster radius is shown in the top right - hand panel .          figures  [ fig : fig5 ] to [ fig : fig11 ] show the whole set of cmds and colour - colour ( cc ) diagrams for the cluster sample that can be exploited from the present extensive multi - band photometry .",

    "we have also incorporated to the figures the statistical photometric memberships obtained in sect .",
    "3.2.1 by distinguishing stars with different colour symbols as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . at first glance ,",
    "the cleaned cluster cmds ( stars with @xmath18 75% ) resemble those moderately young to intermediate - age , projected on to star fields with different levels of crowdness .",
    "@xcite introduced a new age - metallicity diagnostic diagram for the washington photometric system , @xmath23@xmath24 versus @xmath23@xmath10 - @xmath23@xmath24 , which has shown the ability of unambiguously providing age and metallicity estimates , simultaneously . @xmath23@xmath10 and @xmath23@xmath24 are the respective magnitude differences between the giant branch clump and the main sequence turnoff ( msto ) .",
    "the new procedure allows to derive ages from 1 up to 13 gyr and metallicities [ fe / h ] from -2.0 up to + 0.5 dex , and is independent of the cluster reddening and distance modulus .",
    "we used here that procedure to estimate the age and metallicity of three clusters ( vdbh1 , 31 and 118 ) whose cleaned cmds show a handful of red clump ( rc ) stars ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , [ fig : fig7 ] and [ fig : fig11 ] ) , besides their mstos .",
    "we used the cleaned cluster cmds to measure @xmath10 and @xmath24 magnitudes at the msto and rc , then computed @xmath23@xmath10 and @xmath23@xmath24 and entered into the age - metallicity diagnostic diagram to estimate cluster ages and metallicities .",
    "the resulting @xmath23@xmath24 and @xmath23@xmath10 - @xmath23@xmath24 values with their uncertainties are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12 ] , where we have traced iso - age lines and marked iso - abundance positions using colour - coded lines and filled circles , respectively . from this figure",
    "we estimated by interpolation ages of 1.3@xmath250.2 gyr , 1.5@xmath250.2 gyr and 2.9@xmath250.4 gyr for vdbh1 , 31 and 118 , respectively .",
    "as for the mean metallicities , although rather more uncertain than the ages ( @xmath26[fe / h]= 0.25 dex ) , the clusters appear to be of solar or slightly subsolar metal content .    for the remaining clusters in our sample ( vdbh10 , 72 , 87 and 92 )  whose cmds and cc diagrams resemble those of young clusters ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : fig6 ] , [ fig : fig8 ] , [ fig : fig9 ] and [ fig : fig10 ] )  we also adopted a solar metal content ( see last column of table  [ tab : table9 ] ) .",
    "note that , by considering the whole metallicity range of the milky way open clusters ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by using the theoretical isochrones of @xcite , the differences at the zero age main sequence ( zams ) in @xmath20 and @xmath27 colours is smaller than @xmath3 0.08 and 0.04 mag , respectively .",
    "this result implies that negligible differences between the zamss for the cluster metallicity and that of solar metal content would appear , keeping in mind the intrinsic spread of the stars in the @xmath19 vs @xmath20 and @xmath24 vs @xmath27 cmds .    the availability of six cmds and three different cc diagrams covering wavelengths from the blue up to the near - infrarred allowed us to derive reliable ages , reddenings and distances for the studied clusters .",
    "particularly noticeable in the @xmath19 vs @xmath28 cmd , but applicable to every cmd , the shape of the main sequence ( ms ) , its curvatures ( those less and more pronounced ) , the relative distance between the rc and the msto in magnitude and colour separately , among others , are features tightly related to the cluster age , regardless their reddenings and distances . for this reason , we started by selecting theoretical isochrones @xcite with the adopted cluster metallicities in order to chose those which best match the clusters features in the cmds . from our first choices , we derived the cluster reddenings by shifting those isochrones in the three cc diagrams following the reddening vectors until their bluest points coincided with the observed ones .",
    "note that this requirement allowed us to use the @xmath29 vs @xmath30 cc diagram as well , even though the reddening vector runs almost parallell to the cluster sequence .",
    "finally , the mean @xmath31 colour excesses were used to properly shift the chosen isochrones in the cmds in order to derive the cluster true distance modulii by shifting the isochrones along the magnitude axes .",
    "we iterated this procedure whenever refinements in the cluster ages were necessary .",
    "nevertheless , we found that isochrones bracketing the initial age choice by @xmath15 log(@xmath32 yr@xmath33 ) = @xmath250.10 represent the overall age uncertainties owing to the observed dispersion in the cluster cmds and cc diagrams .",
    "although in some cases the age dispersion is smaller than @xmath15 log(@xmath32 yr@xmath33 ) = 0.10 , we prefer to keep the former value as an upper limit to our error budget . in order to enter the isochrones into the cmds and cc diagrams we used the following ratios : @xmath34/@xmath31 = 0.72 + 0.05@xmath11@xmath31 @xcite ; @xmath35/@xmath31 = 0.65 , @xmath36/@xmath31 = 1.25 , @xmath37/@xmath31 = 3.1 @xcite ; @xmath38/@xmath31 = 1.97 , @xmath39/@xmath31 = 0.692 , @xmath40/@xmath31 = 2.62 @xcite .",

    "that this error comes from propagation of the @xmath19 magnitude errors in the mass distribution along the theoretical isochrones .",
    "it does not reflect the deviation of the cluster mass computed from stars with @xmath18 75% from the actual total cluster mass . nevertheless , at first glance , the appearance of the cluster cmds and cc diagrams ( @xmath18 75% ) do not seem to significantly differ from those including any other observed stars placed along the adopted isochrones with @xmath42 75% , thought to be cluster stars . at the same time",

    ", they derived a slightly younger age which in turn led to estimate a larger distance .",
    "we are confident of our age value which comes from a cmd analysis as well as from the washington age - metallicity diagnostic diagram analysis .",

    "the studied clusters are mostly located between the carina and perseus arms , with the sole exception of vdbh118 , which lies between the carina and crux spiral arms and is one of the most distant open clusters from the sun in that direction as well . in general terms , the seven vdbh clusters are distributed outside the circle around the sun ( d @xmath3 2.0 kpc ) where the catalogued clusters are mostly concentrated .        the structural parameters estimated from the stellar density radial profiles in combination with the fundamental properties derived from the analysis of cmds and cc diagrams allow us to investigate the internal dynamical state of the clusters . here",

    "@xcite presented a unified picture for the evolution of star clusters on the two - body relaxation timescale from direct n - body simulations of star clusters in a tidal field .",
    "their treatment of the stellar evolution is based on the approximation that most of the relevant stellar evolution occurs on a timescale shorter than a relaxation time , when the most massive stars lose a significant fraction of mass and consequently contribute to a global expansion of the system . later in the life of a star cluster , two - body relaxation tends to erase the memory of the initial density profile and concentration .",
    "they found that the structure of the system , as measured by the core to half mass radius ratio , the concentration parameter @xmath7= log(@xmath57 ) , among others , evolve toward a universal state , which is set by the efficiency of heating on the visible population of stars induced by dynamical interactions in the core of the system . in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] we plotted the dependence of the concentration parameter @xmath7 with the cluster mass and the age/@xmath5 ratio , respectively .",
    "they show that our dynamically evolved clusters are within those with relatively high @xmath7 values , and that star clusters tend to initially start their dynamical evolution with relatively small concentration parameters .",

    "[ fig : fig14 ] shows that the studied clusters have @xmath59 ratios in fairly agreement , within the uncertainties , with that of tidally filled clusters , and @xmath58 ratios suggesting mass segregation in their core regions .",

    "the employed technique makes use of variable cells in order to reproduce the field cmd as closely as possible .    the availability of three cc diagrams and six cmds covering wavelengths from the blue up to the near - infrarred allowed us to derive reliable ages , reddenings and distances for the studied clusters .",
    "we exploited such a wealth in combination with a new age - metallicity diagnostic diagram for the washington system and theoretical isochrones computed by @xcite to find out that the clusters in our sample cover a wide age range , from @xmath3 60 myr up to 2.8 gyr , are of relatively small size ( @xmath3 1 @xmath4 6 pc ) and are placed at distances from the sun which vary between 1.8 and 6.3 kpc , respectively .",

    "it also belongs to the sample of the farthest known clusters placed between the carina and crux spiral arms .",
    "we estimated lower limits for the cluster present - day masses as well as half - mass relataxion times .",
    "their resulting values suggest that the studied clusters have advanced states of their internal dynamical evolution , i.e. , their ages are many times the relaxation times ( @xmath3 20 @xmath4 320 ) .",
    "when combined with the obtained structural parameters , we found that the clusters are possible in the phase typical of those tidally filled with mass segregation in their core regions .",
    "we compared the cluster masses , concentration parameters and age/@xmath5 ratios with those for 236 clusters located in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the seven vdbh clusters are within more massive ( @xmath3 80 @xmath4 380@xmath6 ) , with higher @xmath7 values , and dynamically evolved ones .",
    "there is also a broad correlation between the cluster massses and the dynamical state , in the sense that the more the advanced the internal dynamical evolution , the less the cluster mass .",
    "the apparent decrease of clusters with masses smaller than @xmath3 200@xmath6 and ages @xmath3 100 times older than their relaxation times could suggest the beggining of cluster dissolution , with some exceptions .",

    "<S> we present results from johnson @xmath0 , kron - cousins @xmath1 and washington @xmath2 photometries for seven van den bergh - hagen ( vdbh ) open clusters , namely , vdbh1 , 10 , 31 , 72 , 87 , 92 , and 118 . the high - quality , multi - band photometric data sets were used to trace the cluster stellar density radial profiles and to build colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and colour - colour ( cc ) diagrams from which we estimated their structural parameters and fundamental astrophysical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters in our sample cover a wide age range , from @xmath3 60 myr up to 2.8 gyr , are of relatively small size ( @xmath3 1 @xmath4 6 pc ) and are placed at distances from the sun which vary between 1.8 and 6.3 kpc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimated lower limits for the cluster present - day masses as well as half - mass relaxation times ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting values in combination with the structural parameter values suggest that the studied clusters are in advanced stages of their internal dynamical evolution ( age/@xmath5 @xmath3 20 @xmath4 320 ) , possibly in the typical phase of those tidally filled with mass segregation in their core regions . </S>",
    "<S> compared to open clusters in the solar neighbourhood , the seven vdbh clusters are within more massive ( @xmath3 80 @xmath4 380@xmath6 ) , with higher concentration parameter values ( @xmath7 @xmath3 0.75@xmath41.15 ) and dynamically evolved ones .    </S>",
