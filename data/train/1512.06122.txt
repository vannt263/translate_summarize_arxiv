    ", a two - dimensional version of graphite , is a very promising material in emerging nanoelectric devices , such as transistors  @xcite , tunable terahertz ( thz ) antennas  @xcite and surface plasmon waveguides  @xcite .",

    ", a two - dimensional graphene can be numerically characterized through the scalar conductivity  @xcite without the magnetic bias .",
    "some numerical methods are emerging to deal with the scalar conductivity of graphene , such as , the method of moments ( mom )  @xcite , finite difference time domain ( fdtd )  @xcite method , and the partial element equivalent circuit ( peec ) method  @xcite . for fdtd method",
    ", it turns the surface conductivity of graphene into the complex permittivity by dividing the thickness of graphene .",
    "afterwards , by applying three dimensional meshes , the finite difference method can solve this two - dimensional geometry cumbersomely .",
    "for the integral - based algorithms , for example , the mom method , it can directly implement the surface conductivity into the numerical process , but the physical process of how the magnetostatic field affects the properties of graphene is not clear since this is a pure mathematical process . among these numerical methods , peec has its natural advantage over any other methods .",
    "it not only proposes an equivalent circuit model for graphene which can capture the physical characteristics , but also it applies the surface conductivity graphene directly without involving volumetric meshes , which significantly reduces the time consumption and memory size .",

    "hence , the numerical methods have to settle the dispersive and anisotropic properties of graphene simultaneously . in  @xcite ,",
    "a fdtd approach is developed by transforming the 2d drude - model surface conductivity of graphene into a volumetric tensor , and implementing it by using the auxiliary differential equation ( ade ) and the matrix exponential method .",

    "is proposed to solve the dispersivity and anisotropy of magnetostatically biased graphene . in the equivalent circuit model",
    ", the diagonal elements of the surface conductivity tensor intrinsically correspond to the resistance of each inductive branch , which is the same as the unbiased scalar conductivity of graphene  @xcite .",
    "for the off - diagonal elements of the conductivity tensor , a new equivalent circuit model is developed to model the resistive characteristics by utilizing current control voltage sources ( ccvss ) .",
    "the ccvss are in series with the intrinsic resistors . to demonstrate our proposed method , several numerical examples are compared with the results from other numerical methods .",
