    "attracting interest in the field of wave chaos @xcite , elastomechanical systems are being studied analytically , numerically , and experimentally .",
    "weaver first measured the few hundred lower eigen frequencies of an aluminum block and worked out the spectral statistics @xcite .",
    "spectral statistics coinciding with random matrix theory were observed in experiments for monocrystalline quartz blocks shaped as three - dimensional sinai billiards @xcite , as well as , in experimental and numerical studies of flexural modes @xcite and in - plane modes @xcite for stadium - shaped plates .",
    "statistical properties of eigen functions describing standing waves in elastic billiards were first reported by schaadt _",
    "the authors measured the displacement field of several eigen modes of a thin plate shaped as a sinai stadium . due to a good preservation of up - down symmetry in the case of thin plates they dealt with two types of modes .",
    "the flexural modes with displacement perpendicular to the plane of the plate are well described by the scalar biharmonic kirchoff - love equation @xcite . in this case a good agreement with theoretical prediction for both intensity statistical distribution and intensity correlation function was found .",
    "however in the case of in - plane displacements described by the vectorial navier - cauchy equation @xcite an agreement between the intensity correlator experimental data and the theory was not achieved @xcite .    the aim of present letter is to present an analogue of the berry conjecture for elastic vibrating solids and derive the amplitude and intensity correlators with corresponding comparison to numerics .",
    "quite recently , acolzin and weaver suggested a method to calculate the intensity correlator of vibrating elastic solids @xcite .",
    "based on the green s function averaging technique they succeeded to derive the intensity correlator of flexural modes generalized due the finite thickness of a plate .",
    "although the method might be used for the in - plane modes in elastic chaotic billiards , we propose here a more simple and physically transparent approach based on random superposition of traveling plane waves ( gaussian random wave ( grw ) or the berry function @xcite ) .",
    "we show that the approach allows to derive all kinds of the correlators of rgw not only in infinite elastic media but also to take into account the double ray splitting at the boundary of a plate that plays a significant role in the elastomechanical chaotic motion @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the two - dimensional case because of the current experiments available .",
    "note however that the method can be easily generalized for the three - dimensional case .",
    "shapiro and goelman @xcite first presented statistics of the eigenfunctions in chaotic quantum billiard although their numerical histogram was not compared with the gaussian distribution .",
    "this was done by mcdonnell and kaufmann @xcite who concluded that the majority ( @xmath0 ) of the eigenfunctions of the bunimovich billiard are a gaussian random field .",
    "later it was confirmed by numerous numerical and experimental studies .",
    "the simple way to construct rgf is random superposition of particular solutions of eq .",
    "( [ helm ] ) @xcite with sufficient number @xmath1 .",
    "thus we come to the berry conjecture in the form @xcite @xmath2,\\ ] ] where the phases @xmath3 are random distributed uniformly in range @xmath4 and all the amplitudes are taken to be equal ( one could assume random independent amplitudes , without any change in the results ) .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath5 are uniformly distributed on a d - dimensional sphere of radius @xmath6 .",
    "it follows now from the central limit theorem that both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are independent gaussian variables . in a closed billiard",
    "the berry function is viewed as a sum of many standing waves , that is simply real or imaginary part of function ( [ berryqm ] ) .    in our case one",
    "has to construct a rgw - function describing acoustic in - plane modes .",
    "these modes are described by a two - dimensional navier - cauchy equation @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the displacement field in the plate , @xmath11 are the material dependent lam@xmath12 coefficients , and @xmath13 is the density . introducing elastic potentials @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 with the help of the helmholtz @xcite decomposition the displacement field @xmath16 could be written , @xmath17 eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) reduces to two helmholtz equations for the elastic potentials @xmath18 here @xmath19 are the wave numbers for the longitudinal and transverse waves , respectively and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is young s modulus . in the two - dimensional case potential * a * has only one none - zero component @xmath22 and the dimensionless longitudinal and transverse sound velocities @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is poisson s ratio @xcite . @xmath21 and @xmath25 are functions of the lam@xmath12 coefficients @xcite .",
    "our conjecture is that both elastic potential be statically independent berry - like functions ( [ berryqm ] ) .",
    "we write the potentials in the following form @xmath26,\\nonumber \\\\ a_z({\\bf x } ) = \\frac{a_t}{ik_t}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}}\\sum_{n=1}^n\\exp[i({\\bf k}_{tn}{\\bf x}+\\theta_{tn})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are statistically independent random phases .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 are uniformly distributed on circles of radii @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively . according to ( [ poten ] )",
    "the components @xmath33 of the vectorial displacement field @xmath16 could be now written @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\    + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{n}}\\sum_{n=1}^n    \\sin\\phi_{tn}\\exp[i({\\bf k}_{tn}{\\bf x}+\\theta_{tn})],\\nonumber\\\\ v({\\bf x})= \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\gamma}{n}}\\sum_{n=1}^n    \\sin\\phi_{ln}\\exp[i({\\bf k}_{ln}{\\bf x}+\\theta_{ln})]\\nonumber\\\\    -\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{n}}\\sum_{n=1}^n    \\cos\\phi_{tn}\\exp[i({\\bf k}_{tn}{\\bf x}+\\theta_{tn})],\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 are the angles between @xmath36 and the x - axis respectively .",
    "the prefactors @xmath37 are chosen from the normalization condition @xmath38 , and @xmath39 means average over the random phase ensembles .",
    "parameter @xmath40 ranges from 0 ( pure transverse waves ) to 1 ( pure longitudinal waves ) . by similar way one can construct the elastomechanical grw for a closed system .",
    "one can see that the berry analogue of chaotic displacements ( [ full ] ) is not a sum of two independent grws ( or two independent berry functions ) @xmath41 as it was conjectured by schaadt _",
    "_ @xcite with arbitrary coefficients @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , each component @xmath43 and @xmath44 in eq ( [ full ] ) is related to the berry functions ( [ berry ] ) via space derivatives in accordance to relations ( [ poten ] ) .",
    "first , we calculate the amplitude correlation functions in chaotic elastic plate for in - plane grw ( [ full ] ) . for quantum mechanical grw ( [ berryqm ] ) the two - dimensional correlation function @xmath45 was found firstly by berry @xcite .",
    "straightforward procedure of averaging over ensembles of random phases @xmath46 and next , over angles of k - vectors gives    ) for @xmath47 ( green solid line ) , @xmath48 ( red dashed line ) , and @xmath49 ( blue dot - dashed line ) ; @xmath50 ( aluminum ) . ]",
    "@xmath51    where @xmath52 it is important to note that the correlation functions ( [ correl ] ) were obtained for given direction of the vector @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the angle included between vector @xmath55 and the x - axis .",
    "however , averaged over all directions of @xmath56 , the first two correlators simplify @xmath57 while the third vanishes @xmath58 .",
    "one can see that in the averaged case the amplitude correlation function is defined by two scales because of two different sound velocities @xmath59 ; that is obvious .",
    "the correlation function @xmath60 is shown in fig .",
    "[ correlam ] .",
    "next , we calculate the intensity correlation functions @xmath61 where the intensity @xmath62 proportional to the elastic energy of the in - plane oscillations . in quantum mechanics",
    "this value is analogous to the probability density , the correlation function of which was calculated by prigodin _",
    "_ @xcite . for the in - plane chaotic grw of the form @xmath41 schaadt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite derived the intensity correlation function as @xmath63 ^ 2.\\ ] ]    our calculations similar to those as for the amplitude correlation functions ( [ correl ] ) give the different result @xmath64 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2\\eta}[(\\gamma j_2(k_ls)-(1-\\gamma)j_2(k_ts)]^2&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 for real grw and @xmath66 for complex one .",
    "although the first term in ( [ p2 ] ) corresponds to ( [ p2shaadt ] ) there is a different term consisted of the bessel functions @xmath67 .",
    "the mathematical origin of deviation is that formula ( [ full ] ) contains the contributions of the components of the wave vectors @xmath68 and @xmath69 via space derivatives .",
    "waves propagate freely inside the billiard , that is , the longitudinal and transverse components are decoupled .",
    "wave conversion occurs at the boundary according to snell s law @xmath70 the reflection amplitudes for each event of the reflection can be easily found following the procedure described in @xcite . at",
    "first we consider more easy case of the dirichlet bc ( the boundary is fixed ) . approximating the boundary as the straight lines for the wavelengths much less than the radius of curvature we have for the reflection amplitudes @xmath71     of the eigen state at frequency @xmath72 in the quarter of the bunimovich billiard with fixed boundary , @xmath50 . ]",
    "next , we assume that all directions of waves are statistically equivalent",
    ". then we have for the energy density of reflected wave @xmath73 where @xmath74 substituting into here ( [ t11 ] ) one can obtain after elementary calculations @xmath75 we do not present here integrals @xmath76 , since after substitution of ( [ tout ] ) into ( [ refl ] ) they cancel each other .",
    "the equality @xmath77 gives a very simple evaluation @xmath78 the next remarkable result is that although the reflection amplitudes for the free bc @xcite have the form different from ( [ t11 ] ) ( see , for example , formulas in @xcite ) , the evaluation of @xmath40 by the same procedure gives the same form as for the fixed bc .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the result does not depend on either the free bc or the fixed bc is applied . using ( [ velocities ] ) formula ( [ gamma ] )",
    "could be written in a more simple form @xmath79     averaged over 200 eigenfunctions of the quarter bunimovich plate .",
    "the solid line is plotted by formula ( [ gam - sigma ] ) . ]",
    "for numerical tests we took the quarter of the bunimovich billiard and calculated the eigenstates of the navier - cauchy equation ( [ basic ] ) with the fixed bc : @xmath80 at the boundary of the billiard by the finite - difference method .",
    "an example of the eigenstate in the form of intensity @xmath81 is presented in fig .",
    "first of all we verified formula ( [ gam - sigma ] ) . for each value of poisson s ratio @xmath25 in the range",
    "@xmath82 $ ] with the step 0.05 , 200 eigenfunctions of the billiard were found to calculate averaged @xmath40 .",
    "the resulted dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath25 is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] , that demonstrates a good agreement with formula ( [ velocities ] ) .",
    "thereby we can evaluate @xmath40 for specific @xmath50 which correspond to aluminum plate and plot the correlation functions . the intensity correlation function ( [ p2 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ p2comp ] compared to the numerics calculated for the eigen function presented in fig .",
    "one can see a good coincidence of the theory with the numerical results that demonstrates correctness of the grw - approach ( [ full ] ) to chaos in elastic billiards .",
