    "electroweak properties of the nucleon can be studied by parity - violating electron - nucleon scattering at low to medium energies @xcite .",
    "such experiments can measure the asymmetry factor coming from the difference between cross sections of left- and right - handed electrons .",
    "this asymmetry between left- and right - handed particles , as a result of a parity - violating interference between the weak and electromagnetic forces , is clearly predicted in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "extracting the physics of interest from the measured asymmetry requires evaluating nlo contribution to electroweak scattering at very high precision .",
    "the method for evaluation of the electron - nucleon up to nlo differential cross sections most commonly found in the literature is to follow the feynman rules for the particles of the standard model .",
    "the dominant contribution normally comes from the leading order ( lo ) correction in perturbation theory .",
    "some of the electroweak nlo contributions to intermediate energy , parity non - conserving semi - leptonic neutral current interactions have been addressed previously in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also estimated effects due to an intrinsic weak interaction in the nucleon ( e. g. the anapole moment ) in chiral perturbation theory , and found the anapole moment contributions insignificant , only slightly enhancing the axial vector nlo contribution .",
    "later work in @xcite took the advantage of the modern computational opportunities and improved the techniques for one - quark nlo computation by retaining analytical momentum - dependent expressions , and providing the numerical evaluations of 446 one - loop diagrams .",
    "it also included calculation of the soft photon emission contribution .",
    "however , in @xcite , even after removing infra - red ( ir ) divergences through soft - photon emission corrections , calculated one - quark nlo contribution show a logarithmic dependence on the detector s photon acceptance parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the article presented here demonstrates that elimination of this dependence can be achieved by adding the hard - photon bremsstrahlung ( hpb ) differential cross section .",
    "we express general electroweak couplings by inserting appropriate form factors into vertices and construct hpb differential cross sections as a function of mandelstam invariants . for each set of experimental constraints ,",
    "integration over the emitted photon phase space can be performed numerically .",
    "analytical results of this article can be used for several recent pv experiments @xcite .",
    "the article provides a detailed description of both hard- and soft - photon emission treatment of infrared divergences the pv electroweak interference and pure weak contributions to the total differential cross section . as an example",
    ", we choose to consider electron - proton scattering , as one of the most relevant cases from a physics perspective .",
    "however , the same technique of treating infrared ( ir ) divergences can be expanded to neutron or any other baryon target if same effective structure of the coupling is used .",
    "if the structure of the nucleon is investigated using weak , neutral current probe @xcite , it is necessary to enhance the weak contribution in electron - nucleon scattering by exploiting the parity - violating nature of the weak interactions and constructing the following quantity ( asymmetry ) : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is a leading order asymmetry measured in the parts per million ( ppm ) and second term of eq.([eq : pv1 ] ) is a parity - violating nlo contribution to the asymmetry .    finally , if the axial - vector ( @xmath3 ) or vector - axial ( @xmath4 ) form factors of the parity violating amplitude are studied @xcite , which can be taken from pv hamiltonian @xmath5,\\label{eq : pvhamiltonian}\\ ] ] with perturbative expansion resulting in @xmath6    all of the above nlo contributions to the either asymmetry ( eq.([eq : pv1 ] ) ) or pv form - factor ( eq.([i1.5 ] ) ) in general can be infra - red divergent @xcite , and can be treated by the soft and hard - photon emission contribution shown on fig .",
    "( [ fbr1.1 ] ) .     ]    the differential cross section associated with bremsstrahlung emission in electron - nucleon scattering can be described by the following formula , @xmath7 the first term of eq.([eq : br1.1 ] ) is responsible for the cancellation of ir divergences if a parity conserving electromagnetic probe is used .",
    "the second term , when used in the asymmetry @xmath8 is responsible for canceling ir divergences in eq.([eq : pv1 ] ) . finally , ir divergences in the nlo form - factors ( eq.([i1.5 ] ) ) are indirectly treated by the third term of eq.([eq : br1.1 ] ) , and will be discussed later in this article .",
    "generally , bremsstrahlung diagrams can be described as @xmath9 processes in which integration over emitted photon s phase space should be performed .",
    "if the momentum of the emitted photon is small enough to be neglected in the numerator algebra , we can present the bremsstrahlung cross section as a soft photon factor multiplied by the tree level differential cross section of @xmath10 process .",
    "let us consider an example .",
    "the scattering amplitude for the first diagram of fig.([fbr1.1 ] ) , for the neutral current reaction , has the following structure : @xmath11 where the photon polarization vector enters as @xmath12 ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the couplings of electron with z boson , nucleon with z boson , and photon with nucleon , respectively , defined as @xmath15,\\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\\\gamma_{z - n}^{\\mu}\\,(q ) & = & ie\\left[f_{1}(q)\\gamma^{\\mu}+\\frac{i}{2m_{n}}\\sigma^{\\mu\\rho}q_{\\rho}\\ , f_{2}(q)+g_{1}(q)\\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma_{5}\\right],\\label{br1.2}\\\\ \\nonumber \\\\\\gamma_{\\gamma - n}^{\\alpha}\\,(q ) & = & ie\\left[f_{1}(q)\\gamma^{\\alpha}+\\frac{i}{2m_{n}}\\sigma^{\\alpha\\rho}(q)_{\\rho}f_{2}(q)\\right].\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 corresponds to the momentum transferred to the nucleon from the vector boson .",
    "the shortened notation of @xmath17 and @xmath18 refers to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the weinberg mixing angle . for the form factors @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 we have used @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 defined as",
    "the nucleon s dirac , pauli , and axial form factors at zero momentum transfer and corresponds to the electric charge , anomalous magnetic moment , and axial charge , respectively . here",
    ", we use the universal formfactor of monopole or dipole type @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29    in the soft - photon emission limit the coupling between the emitted photon and the nucleon , @xmath30 , is just equal to @xmath31 , where charge @xmath32 for proton ( neutron ) .",
    "the numerator of nucleon s propagator @xmath33 can be replaced by @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be easily simplified into @xmath36 . using the dirac equation for free spinors , we have @xmath37 now we can present the soft - photon amplitude in the following form : @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is a tree level amplitude of @xmath10 process . eq.([br1.4a ] ) can be used for the other photon emission diagrams with a different factor @xmath40 .",
    "now we can sum over all four graphs on fig.([fbr1.1 ] ) and square the total amplitude to get the following : @xmath41 the photon couples to a current which is conserved : @xmath42 this fact , and the summation over all photon polarizations gives us the possibility to replace @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "the last step is to integrate over the emitted photon phase space @xmath45 and regularize the infrared divergence by assigning to the photon small rest mass @xmath46 this dependence on the rest mass of the photon will be canceled when added to ir divergent nlo contribution ( see eqs.([eq : pv1 ] , [ eq : asymbr ] ) ) .",
    "the resulting soft - photon emission differential cross section is expressed as @xmath47 here @xmath0 is the maximum possible energy of emitted photon for which the soft - photon approximation is still valid .",
    "numerical analysis leads to a typical constraint @xmath48 .    in eq.([br1.6 ] ) , @xmath49 is the soft - photon emission integral evaluated earlier by @xcite , and equal to @xmath50,\\label{br1.7}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the fermion s energy and spatial momentum in center of mass reference frame , correspondingly .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 can be extracted from table ( [ softtable ] ) .",
    ".soft photon emission integral parameters of eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) [ softtable ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     data for table ( [ t1.2 ] ) have been computed using the same integration technique , and it is clear that variations of the asymmetry are @xmath55 . in the test of independence from the @xmath0 parameter we took one of the kinematic points of the g0 experiment , with @xmath56 gev@xmath57 . for the complete analysis of @xmath58 pv scattering asymmetries it is required to include all the lo and nlo contributions , which will be left to a future publication using the treatment of ir divergences described in this article .",
    "the calculation routines , tested for electron - proton scattering and presented in our previous work @xcite , are valid for any electroweak processes involving particles of the standard model .",
    "the hpb contribution computed in the current work can be applied for virtually any scattering process .",
    "again , when computing hard - photon bremsstrahlung terms for electron - proton scattering , we use effective @xmath59 and @xmath60 couplings with monopole type form factors .",
    "the enormous size of the complete analytical expressions involved makes it impossible to present them in this paper .",
    "the complete analytical expression in the @xmath61 file is available from authors upon request .",
    "we observed that for the energy range employed by the pv experiments the hpb differential cross section is dominated by part of hpb amplitude without the photon momentum in the numerator .",
    "it is still necessary to keep in mind that the process is @xmath62 when the cross section is calculated .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath63 tend to be important for higher energies .",
    "this simplifies calculations of the hpb cross section for the considered experiments significantly , as it simplifies the numerator algebra .",
    "we split the amplitude in two parts , with one part being the amplitude without the momentum of the emitted photon in the numerator .",
    "this step is important , because , according to the numerical analysis performed , this term has a strong dominant structure similar to the soft - photon emission factor .",
    "another interesting result of this work is that all of the effects , including soft- and hard - photon bremsstrahlung terms , can be now accounted for on the level of pv formfactors .",
    "the proper account of the soft- and hard - photon bremsstrahlung effects has allowed us to achieve final results that are free from a logarithmic dependence on the detector photon acceptance parameter .",
