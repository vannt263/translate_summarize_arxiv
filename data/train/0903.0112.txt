    "given a closed , irreducible 3manifold , its complexity is the minimum number of tetrahedra in a ( pseudo  simplicial ) triangulation of the manifold .",
    "this number agrees with the complexity defined by matveev  @xcite unless the manifold is @xmath4 @xmath5 or @xmath6 the complexity for an infinite family of closed manifolds has first been given by the authors in @xcite .",
    "the family consisted of lens spaces having a non - trivial @xmath7cohomology class and satisfying an additional , combinatorial constraint .",
    "the main idea in the present paper is the following .",
    "suppose @xmath8 is a 3manifold having a connected double cover , @xmath9 a one - vertex triangulation , @xmath10 of @xmath8 lifts to a 2vertex triangulation , @xmath11 of @xmath9 because there are two vertices , the lifted triangulation will , in general , not be minimal .",
    "one may choose an edge , @xmath12 joining the two vertices .",
    "if certain hypotheses apply , @xmath13 and the tetrahedra incident with it can be _ crushed _ to form a new one - vertex triangulation @xmath14 of @xmath9 if @xmath15 denotes the number of tetrahedra incident with @xmath12 then @xmath16 if the complexity of @xmath17 is known , this line of argument can be used to show that a given triangulation of @xmath8 must be minimal . the weakest general bound resulting from this approach",
    "is stated below :    [ pro : crushing - intro ] let @xmath8 be a closed , orientable , connected , irreducible 3manifold , and suppose @xmath17 is a connected double cover of @xmath18 if @xmath19 then @xmath20    this paper determines the minimal triangulations of the manifolds for which equality holds .",
    "this is based on previous work @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath21 has complexity @xmath22 the lens space @xmath21 double covers both the lens space @xmath0 and the generalised quaternionic space @xmath23 where @xmath24    [ pro : crushing - eq ] let @xmath8 be a closed , orientable , connected , irreducible 3manifold , and suppose @xmath17 is a connected double cover of @xmath18 if @xmath25 then either    1 .   @xmath26 and @xmath27 or 2 .",
    "@xmath28 for some @xmath29 and @xmath8 has a unique minimal triangulation and is the lens space @xmath0 or the generalised quaternionic space @xmath30    it should be noted that the proof does not use the fact that the minimal triangulation of @xmath21 is unique ; the uniqueness part follows from the fact that these triangulations are shown to be dual to one - sided heegaard splittings .",
    "we now describe the unique minimal triangulations in an alternative way .",
    "recall from @xcite that each lens space has a unique _ minimal layered triangulation _ and that this is conjectured to be its unique minimal triangulation .",
    "the minimal layered triangulation of the lens space @xmath0 has @xmath31 tetrahedra .",
    "( the main result in @xcite does not include these lens spaces . )    following burton @xcite , a _ layered chain _ of length @xmath2 denoted @xmath32 is defined to be a certain triangulation of the solid torus with four boundary faces and @xmath31 tetrahedra . a suitable identification of the boundary faces of @xmath33 results in the _ twisted layered loop triangulation _ @xmath34 of @xmath30    [ cor : minimal triangulations ] for every @xmath35 @xmath0 and @xmath1 have complexity @xmath36 the unique minimal triangulation of @xmath0 is its minimal layered triangulation and the unique minimal triangulation of @xmath1 is its twisted layered loop triangulation .",
    "this implies that for every positive integer @xmath2 there is a closed , orientable , connected , irreducible 3manifold of complexity @xmath36 since @xmath4 @xmath37 and @xmath38 have complexity one , we in fact have :    [ cor : amusing ] for every positive integer @xmath2 there are at least two spherical 3manifolds of complexity @xmath36    the first author is partially supported by nsf grant dms-0505609 and the grayce b. kerr foundation .",
    "the second and third authors are partially supported under the australian research council s discovery funding scheme ( project number dp0664276 ) .",
    "we use the same notation as in @xcite for triangulations and for the standard models of low degree edges in minimal triangulations .    [",

    "hence @xmath40 has precisely two vertices .",
    "denote @xmath13 an edge in @xmath40 with distinct endpoints .",
    "suppose @xmath13 is contained in at most three tetrahedra .",
    "then the same is true for its image @xmath46 in @xmath47 moreover , there is a non - trivial homomorphism @xmath48 associated with the covering , and @xmath49=1.$ ]    first note that if the degree of @xmath46 is at most five , then inspection of the possibilities stated in @xcite keeping in mind that @xmath49=1,$ ] @xmath50 and @xmath46 is incident with at most three tetrahedra yields the possibilities @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 recall that @xmath15 denotes the number of tetrahedra incident with @xmath55 the last two possibilities force @xmath56 a contradiction . in case",
    "it is modelled on @xmath51 one observes that @xmath13 is of degree five and contained in precisely four tetrahedra in @xmath57 a contradiction .",

    "it remains to analyse the possibilities when @xmath61 we make some preliminary observations that limit the number of cases to consider .",
    "since @xmath62 and @xmath39 is 0efficient , it follows that no face in @xmath39 is a cone @xcite or a dunce hat @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath63 is a 3simplex in @xmath64 then @xmath65 consists of at most four edges , and the possibilities ( up to combinatorial equivalence ) are shown in figure [ fig : edges ] .",
    "note that type 3b is not possible , since @xmath66 in @xmath67 for each tetrahedron of type 2a , 3a or 4 , we have that each of its two lifts to @xmath40 is incident with @xmath55 for each of the others , at least one of the lifts is incident with @xmath55    since @xmath68 at least one face of the tetrahedra incident with @xmath46 does not have @xmath46 as an edge .",
    "so at least one of the tetrahedra is of type 1 or 2a .",
    "since @xmath69 the only case with two tetrahedra is ( 2a,4 ) ; this is not possible as the faces incident with @xmath46 can not be matched in pairs . in case",
    "there are three tetrahedra , no tetrahedron can be of type 2a , 3a or 4 as otherwise @xmath70 this leaves no possibility when @xmath61    if @xmath8 has complexity @xmath71 or @xmath72 and @xmath17 is a connected double cover of @xmath73 then the inequality @xmath74 holds by inspection of the census of @xcite . to streamline notation",
    ", we will list the possibilities as @xmath75 they are : @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 and the cases @xmath79 in the families @xmath80 and @xmath81      [ pro : crushing ] suppose that the minimal triangulation @xmath39 of the closed , orientable , connected and irreducible 3manifold @xmath8 is lifted to a triangulation @xmath40 of a connected double cover , and that @xmath82    then every edge connecting the two distinct vertices in @xmath40 is contained in at least three distinct tetrahedra and can be crushed . in particular , if @xmath13 is such an edge , then @xmath83 where @xmath15 is the number of tetrahedra incident with @xmath55    since @xmath43 @xmath39 is @xmath45efficient with a single vertex , and hence @xmath40 has precisely two vertices .",
    "let @xmath13 be an edge in @xmath40 with distinct endpoints .",
    "it follows from lemma [ lem : edges ] that @xmath84 as in @xcite , we can crush @xmath13 and the surrounding tetrahedra to form a one vertex triangulation triangulation of @xmath17 , so long as there are no inadmissible gluings on the boundary of this set of tetrahedra . that this is",
    "always the case follows from the fact that the two ends of @xmath13 are the two vertices , @xmath85 and @xmath86 of the triangulation .",
    "so any edge @xmath87 in a face @xmath88 containing @xmath13 can not be glued to the third edge @xmath89 of @xmath88 , since if @xmath87 has ends at @xmath90 then @xmath89 has ends at @xmath91 and vice versa . moreover ,",
    "neither @xmath87 nor @xmath89 can be glued to @xmath13 since otherwise the image of @xmath88 in @xmath39 is a cone or dunce hat which implies @xmath92 since @xmath39 is 0efficient ( see @xcite corollary  5.4 and @xcite lemma  7 ) .",
    "hence @xmath13 can be crushed and we have @xmath93    suppose the hypothesis of the proposition is satisfied . if @xmath94 the statement follows from the discussion preceding proposition [ pro : crushing ] .",
    "hence assume @xmath50 and choose a minimal triangulation , @xmath10 of @xmath18 then every edge connecting the two vertices , @xmath85 and @xmath95 of @xmath40 can be crushed .",
    "since we stipulate equality , it follows that every such edge is contained in precisely three distinct tetrahedra .",
    "hence its image under the covering map is contained in at most three distinct tetrahedra in @xmath47 denote @xmath46 the image in @xmath39 of an edge in @xmath40 connecting the two vertices .",
    "it follows from lemma [ lem : edges ] that @xmath46 is of degree four and its neighbourhood is modelled on @xmath42 note that each of its lifts , @xmath96 to @xmath40 also has its neighbourhood modelled on @xmath42 moreover , each tetrahedron incident with @xmath97 has precisely one edge with both ends at @xmath85 and one with both ends at @xmath98 since each tetrahedron also contains other edges than @xmath97 connecting the two vertices , this propagates and one observes that in @xmath40 there is precisely one edge with both ends at @xmath85 and precisely one edge with both ends at @xmath98 moreover , there is a normal surface , @xmath99 made up entirely of quadrilateral discs which is the boundary of a neighbourhood of each of these edges . since @xmath17 is orientable , this implies that @xmath100 is a torus .",
    "( alternatively , observe that @xmath100 is separating and has vanishing euler characteristic since all vertices in the cell decomposition of @xmath100 by quadrilateral discs have degree four . )",
    "whence @xmath17 is a lens space .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 contains a quadrilateral surface which is double covered by the torus and dual to the @xmath101cohomology class .",
    "it hence is a klein bottle and incompressible . in particular ,",
    "the triangulation @xmath39 is dual to a 1sided heegaard diagram .",
    "the regular neighbourhood of the klein bottle is homeomorphic to the twisted @xmath102bundle over the klein bottle , and its boundary is hence a torus . as in @xcite , choose generators @xmath103 for the klein bottle such that @xmath104 correspond to standard generators for the boundary torus .",
    "then @xmath8 is obtained by attaching a solid torus with meridian disc corresponding to the curve @xmath105 for some @xmath106 and @xmath107 the dual triangulation has precisely one tetrahedron for each intersection point of the boundary of the meridian disc .",
    "the minimal number of such points is @xmath108 and there is a unique curve up to isotopy which realises this .",
    "hence @xmath39 is the unique minimal triangulation of @xmath18    moreover , the cover @xmath17 can now be identified as @xmath109 where @xmath110 where @xmath111 are chosen such that @xmath112 note that @xmath17 is not uniquely determined by this .",
    "however , we know by assumption that @xmath113 this forces @xmath114 since otherwise @xmath115 as can be seen from the number of tetrahedra in the minimal layered triangulation of @xmath109 see @xcite .",
    "but then @xmath116 or @xmath117 which gives the conclusion of the proposition .",
    "it is shown in the above proof that for every @xmath35 @xmath1 and @xmath0 have a 1sided heegaard diagram with precisely @xmath31 intersection points , and hence a triangulation having precisely @xmath31 tetrahedra .",
    "the statement of the corollary holds for @xmath118 by inspection of the census in @xcite .",
    "hence assume @xmath119 then , by inspection of the census , we have @xmath120 and @xmath121    suppose a minimal triangulation of @xmath0 or @xmath1 has at most @xmath122 tetrahedra . lifting to the double covering @xmath21 , we get the triangulation @xmath40 with two vertices and at most @xmath123 tetrahedra .",
    "proposition [ pro : crushing ] implies that any edge connecting the two vertices can be crushed and must belong to at least three tetrahedra .",
    "so crushing such an edge gives a one - vertex triangulation of @xmath21 with at most @xmath124 tetrahedra , giving a contradiction to the fact that @xmath21 has complexity @xmath22 hence both @xmath0 and @xmath1 have complexity @xmath31 and the manifolds satisfy the hypothesis of proposition [ pro : crushing - eq ] .    the unique minimal triangulations have been described via the dual 1sided heegaard diagram ; the alternative descriptions stated in corollary [ cor : minimal triangulations ] are given in the next subsections .",
    "for the lens space @xmath126 the minimal layered triangulation , @xmath10 is obtained from the minimal layered extension of @xmath127 by folding along @xmath128 see  @xcite for details .",
    "the sequence of labelings of the layered triangulation is : @xmath129 the minimal layered triangulation of @xmath125 has therefore @xmath31 tetrahedra , and hence is the unique minimal triangulation .",
    "note that @xmath130 the latter being the unique normal form . moreover , @xmath131 element @xmath132 has order @xmath133 @xmath134 has order @xmath135 the subgroup @xmath136 has index two , hence it is normal , and @xmath137 has order @xmath138 it follows that @xmath139 if @xmath31 is odd , and @xmath140 if @xmath31 is even .",
    "the double cover of @xmath141 associated to the action of @xmath142 on @xmath143 is a lens space ; in fact @xmath144        the starting point for the twisted layered loop triangulation is the triangulation with two faces of the annulus shown with labelling in figure [ fig : quaternionic ] .",
    "the edges corresponding to the two boundary components are denoted @xmath145 for _ top _ and @xmath146 for _ bottom _ , and oriented so that they correspond to the same element in fundamental group .",
    "the remaining two edges are @xmath147 and @xmath148 oriented from @xmath145 to @xmath149 tetrahedron @xmath150 is layered along @xmath151 and the new edge denoted @xmath152 and oriented from @xmath145 to @xmath149 the annulus is thus identified with two faces of @xmath153 inductively , tetrahedron @xmath154 is layered along edge @xmath155 and the new edge @xmath156 is oriented from @xmath145 to @xmath149 assume @xmath31 tetrahedra have thus been attached ; if @xmath157 we have an annulus , if @xmath158 a creased solid torus and if @xmath159 a solid torus . denote the resulting triangulation @xmath160    then the two free faces of tetrahedron @xmath161 in @xmath33 are identified with the two free faces of tetrahedron @xmath150 such that @xmath161 is layered along @xmath147 with @xmath162 @xmath163 and @xmath164 the result is a closed 3manifold , denoted @xmath165 and the triangulation , denoted @xmath34 is termed its _ twisted layered loop triangulation_.        place a quadrilateral in each tetrahedron separating edges @xmath145 and @xmath149 this gives a one - sided klein bottle , @xmath168 in @xmath165 and @xmath169 is a solid torus with core @xmath170 we thus have a one - sided heegaard splitting of non - orientable genus two .",
