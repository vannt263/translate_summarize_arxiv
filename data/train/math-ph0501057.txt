    "the recurrence relation follows from the orthogonality condition : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , the @xmath15 are real and @xmath16 are strictly positive .    in this paper",
    "we describe a formalism which will facilitate the determination of the recurrence coefficients for polynomials with singular weights .",
    "two points of view lead to this problem : on one hand the x - ray problem @xcite of condensed matter theory , on the other hand related problems in random matrix theory which involve the asymptotics of the fredholm determinant of finite convolution operators with discontinuous symbols @xcite .",
    "this paper is the first in a series that systematically study orthogonal polynomial where the otherwise smooth weights have been singularly deformed .",
    "the ultimate aim is the computation for large @xmath4 of the determinant @xmath17 of the @xmath18 moments or hankel matrix @xmath19 with moments @xmath20 where @xmath21 , thereby doing what has been done for the determinants of @xmath18 toeplitz matrices with singular generating functions @xcite .",
    "the deformed weight with one jump is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the position of the jump , @xmath24 is the heaviside step function and the real @xmath25 parametrises the height of the jump .",
    "more generally , we take @xmath26 to be the canonical jump function @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ".    the actions of the ladder operators on @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are non - vanishing one must add @xmath36 to and respectively .",
    "now @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the coefficient functions in the ladder operators , satisfy identities analogous to those found for smooth weights @xcite : @xmath37 the derivation of - will be published in a forthcoming paper where the weight has several jumps and @xmath38 $ ] is the jacobi weight .    multiplying the recurrence relation evaluated at @xmath39 by @xmath40 and noting as well as we arrive at the universal equality @xmath41 similarly , squaring @xmath42 we find a second universal equation @xmath43    note that in the expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 only @xmath44 , the `` potential '' associated with the smooth reference weight , appears .",
    "the discontinuities give rise to @xmath45 and @xmath46    it is clear from and that if @xmath47 is rational , then @xmath0 and @xmath1 are also rational .",
    "this is particularly useful for our purpose which is the determination of the recurrence coefficients , for in this situation by comparing residues on both sides of and we should find the required difference equations @xcite .    in the following section the above approach is exemplified by the hermite weight , @xmath48 and @xmath49 given by .",
    "it turns out that in this situation @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related to @xmath52 and @xmath53 in a very simple way .",
    "now , @xmath48 , so that @xmath54 , and @xmath55 as in . also , @xmath56 which are independent of the particular choice of @xmath2 and @xmath57 particular to @xmath58 note that @xmath59 is the value of @xmath60 at @xmath61    instead of proceeding with the full machinery of and we take advantage of the fact that @xmath54 . from orthogonality and the recurrence relation ,",
    "we have @xmath62 by integration by parts .",
    "the string equation , @xmath63 is an immediate consequence of the orthogonality condition .",
    "again , an integration by parts and noting that @xmath64 produces @xmath65 it should be pointed out here that in general neither the string equation nor will provide the complete set of difference equations for the recurrence coefficients which can be seen if @xmath2 were the jacobi weight .",
    "in such a situation the compatibility conditions and must be used .    now and become @xmath66 and @xmath67 equations and , supplemented by the initial conditions @xmath68^{-1 } \\quad \\textrm{and } \\quad r_0({{\\tilde x } } ) = 0 \\ , \\ ] ] can be iterated to determine the recurrence coefficients numerically . also , explicit solutions to and",
    "can be produced for small @xmath4 .",
    "if and are combined with the evolution equations to be derived in this section , the painlev iv mentioned in the abstract is found .",
    "we begin with the @xmath9 norm @xmath70 , , which entails @xmath71 and thus @xmath72 since @xmath73 . with ,",
    "@xmath74 which is the first toda equation .",
    "taking the derivative with respect to @xmath69 of at @xmath75 and using the definition of the monic polynomials then gives @xmath76 since @xmath77 is an immediate consequence of the recurrence relation .",
    "therefore @xmath78 the second toda equation .",
    "eliminating @xmath79 from and the second toda equation , gives @xmath53 in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath80 : @xmath81 using the first toda equation to express @xmath82 in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath83 and substituting into produces a particular painlev iv @xcite , @xmath84 which can be brought into the canonical form with the replacements @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "entails @xmath93 the apparent pole at @xmath94 can be shown to have vanishing residue by considering @xmath95 : @xmath96 where the last equality is due to .",
    "a further regular term can be found as a contribution from the taylor series of @xmath97 about @xmath94 namely , @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath64 and , we see that the first two terms of combined into @xmath100 cancel the third .",

    "@xmath50 and @xmath53 can be determined analytically to any order in @xmath4 because an approximation of @xmath50 to order @xmath126 gives rise to a difference equation for @xmath53 to order @xmath127 via . in turn , @xmath53 to order @xmath127 produces an equation for @xmath50 to order @xmath127 and so forth .",
