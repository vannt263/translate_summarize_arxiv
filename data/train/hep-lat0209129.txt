    "the quark propagator is a fundamental quantity of qcd .",
    "though gauge dependent , it manifestly displays dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , contains the chiral condensate and @xmath0 , and has been used to compute the running quark mass  @xcite .",
    "some model hadron calculations rely on anstze for the quark propagator  @xcite , yet on the lattice we have the opportunity to study it in a direct , nonperturbative fashion .",
    "we use the `` asqtad '' quark action  @xcite , a highly improved staggered action that formally has no @xmath1 errors .",
    "we extend some earlier work  @xcite by also using an improved gluon action .",
    "we have calculated the quark propagator on three sets of configurations : @xmath2 and @xmath3 at @xmath4 ( @xmath5 fm ) and @xmath3 at @xmath6 ( @xmath7 fm ) , each ensemble consisting of 100 configurations .",
    "the configurations were fixed to landau gauge .",
    "most results shown here are from the larger , finer lattice , where we used 8 quark masses : @xmath8 = 0.012 , 0.018 , 0.024 , 0.036 , 0.048 , 0.072 , 0.108 , 0.144 ( 19 to 114 mev ) .    in the ( euclidean ) continuum , lorentz invariance allows us to decompose the full quark propagator into dirac vector and scalar pieces @xmath9.\\ ] ] asymptotic freedom means that , as @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( the free propagator ) where @xmath12 is the bare quark mass .    from consideration of the tree - level form of our lattice action , we define the momentum variable @xmath13\\ ] ] for the asqtad action , where @xmath14 is the usual lattice momentum , @xmath15 by considering the propagator as a function of @xmath16 instead of @xmath14 , we ensure that the lattice quark propagator has the correct tree - level form for @xmath17 and hopefully better approximates its continuum behaviour .",
    "it has already been seen that this produces a significant improvement in the rotational symmetry of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "this prescription does not , however , tell us how to treat the mass function and in the past it has been considered as a function of either @xmath18 or @xmath19 in different studies .",
    "figure  [ fig : quarkmom ] shows the quark mass function for the coarser lattice as a function of both @xmath18 and of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 clearly has less anisotropy when plotted against @xmath19 .",
    "this issue has been studied for the overlap quark propagator and there the mass function appears to converge to the continuum limit most rapidly as a function of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the optimal momentum variable must therefore be determined for each action .",
    "we test for finite volume effects by comparing the quark propagator on the two @xmath21 lattices in fig .",
    "[ fig : finite_volume ] .",
    "no sign of finite volume artefacts is seen in the mass function , but the infrared supression of @xmath17 is stronger on the smaller lattice .",
    "the mass dependence of @xmath22 can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : asq_b460_mall ] .",
    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking can be seen in the infrared enhancement of the mass function which , for small quark masses , is almost independent of the bare mass . for large quark mass ,",
    "the function flattens off . in the case of the @xmath17 function ,",
    "dependence on the quark mass is very weak .    in the continuum , in the chiral limit , the asymptotic behaviour of the quark mass function is related to the chiral condensate  @xcite .",
    "we performed an extrapolation to the chiral limit using a quadratic fit in the quark mass to the cylinder cut data .",
    "a determination of the chiral condensate was then be made by fitting to the tail of @xmath22 .",
    "we chose 2 - 3 gev ( @xmath23 ) for the fit region and set @xmath24 at 691 mev mev  @xcite and converting it to the @xmath25 scheme as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "we find @xmath26 mev ; the quoted error is purely statistical .",
    "a fit to each of the mass functions was done using the ansatz @xmath27 this is the same as the ansatz used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but written slightly differently",
    ". we shall refer to it here as the `` simple '' ansatz .",
    "fit results are shown in table  [ tab : simple_fits ] .",
    "as before , we see that at small quark masses @xmath28 is favoured , while it is near one for the heavier quarks . in this model , @xmath29 is acting as a function of the bare mass , controlling the dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "one fit is shown , for @xmath30 at zero quark mass , in fig .  [",
    "fig : asq_b460_mall ] .",
    "we also investigated a more `` complete '' ansatz , @xmath31^{\\gamma_m } \\biggr )        \\\\",
    "+ \\frac{{\\widehat{m}}}{\\bigl [ \\ln \\bigl ( ( q^2 + \\lambda^2)/{\\ensuremath{\\lambda_{\\text{qcd}}}}^2 \\bigr )            \\bigr]^{d_m}},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is an extension of the one used above that has the correct asymptotic behaviour .",
    "@xmath32 is dimensionless , @xmath33 is the rgi quark mass , @xmath34 is the anomalous dimension of the mass , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 can be related to the scalar condensate  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the current data is insufficient to simultaneously determine @xmath32 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is possible to determine @xmath36 separately from the asymptotic behaviour , as above , but the end product fits the data no better than the simple ansatz ."
