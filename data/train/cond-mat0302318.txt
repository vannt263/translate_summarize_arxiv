    "<S> it is shown that the density of states ( dos ) proportional to the excitation energy , the so - called polar like dos , can arise in the odd - parity states with the superconducting gap vanishing at points even if the spin - orbit interaction for cooper pairing is strong enough . </S>",

    "<S> this is due to the fact that the gap vanishes in quadratic manner around the point on the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the region of quadratic energy dependence of dos , in the state f@xmath4 , is restricted in very small energy region making it difficult to distinguish from the polar - like dos .    in early stage of research of the heavy fermion superconductors </S>",
    "<S> , it has been important to infer the gap anisotropy from the power - law of the temperature dependence of a series of physical quantities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was a sort of the golden rule there that point node(s ) of the superconducting gap leads to the density of states ( dos ) , @xmath5 , while line node(s ) leads to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> it was also emphasized that all the odd - parity pairings would have only point node(s ) if the spin - orbit coupling for the pairing interaction were so strong that the spin- and orbital degrees of freedom of the gap function can not change independently  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not so self - evident whether the spin - orbit coupling for pairing is really so strong to quench technically the independent variation in spin- and orbital space  @xcite . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , the classification scheme proposed by volovik and gorkov ( vg ) has been believed to rule out the polar - like dos for the odd - parity states . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to point out that three of the non - unitary states in vg scheme has the polar - like dos because the @xmath7-dependence of the gap around the point node is quadratic rather than linear .    in the odd - parity manifold , the quasiparticle energy is the matrix in the representation of spin eigen state as follows  @xcite : @xmath8^{1/2 } , \\label{dispersion}\\ ] ] where the superconducting gap is also the 2@xmath92 matrix in the presentation of spin eigenstate , and is represented in terms of the @xmath10-vector as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the pauli matrix of the @xmath13-the component , with @xmath13=@xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . </S>",

    "<S> the result is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the dos is similar to those for the polar state .    </S>",

    "<S> the gap vanishes linearly around the nodes so that the dos is proportional to the square of the energy @xmath30 . </S>",

    "<S> other example , in which the point node(s ) give the polar - like dos , is the so - called planar state with e@xmath44 symmetry which is unitary state and was proposed as a candidate of that of upt@xmath45  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> so , the quasiparticles around the point nodes should also give the polar - like dos if there exists the fermi surface around the nodes .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have pointed out by explicit calculations that the superconducting gap with point nodes in the non - unitary states , f@xmath0 , f@xmath1 , and f@xmath2 , classified by volovik and gorkov , exhibits the polar - like dos which is proportional to the excitation energy itself rather than its square . </S>",
    "<S> this results arises from the fact that the @xmath7-dependence of the gap around the point nodes is quadratic rather than linear as expected in general .    </S>",
