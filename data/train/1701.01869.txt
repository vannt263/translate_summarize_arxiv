    "<S> ( [ model hamiltonian ] ) , one can obtain the many - body ground states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a primary finding is the existence of an exotic supersolid phase with chiral symmetry breaking as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in this phase , </S>",
    "<S> the two spin components are separated along the radial direction in each crystal cell , with one component surrounding the other to form a ring structure . </S>",
    "<S> this form of phase separation is attributed to the choice of unequal intra - component soft - core interactions , and the component with weaker intra - component interaction is always surrounded by the stronger one  [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a)-[fig1](d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> while the phase of the spherical component is trivial , there exists a @xmath15 phase gradient along a closed path around the spin - polarized core in the toroidal component , forming a vortex in each crystal cell [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e)-[fig1](f ) ] . each crystal cell of the supersolid is very similar to the half - quantum vortex predicted in so - coupled condensates with a strong harmonic trap  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that the circulating direction of the superfluid velocity in the vortex is related to the spin orientation in the vortex core , and they satisfy the right - hand rule  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a surprising observation is that the forms of phase separation for all crystal cells are coincident , thus all vortices in the supersolid crystal have the same direction and provide finite net angular momentum in the system with the chiral symmetry broken . </S>",
    "<S> this is distinct from the vortex lattices in an so - coupled hard - core system , where vortices and antivortices emergence in pairs , thus provide zero net angular momentum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the creation of vortex lattices with finite angular momentum is attributed to the combined effects of the so coupling and interatomic soft - core interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this goes beyond the conventional view that an external rotation  @xcite or an effective gauge magnetic field  @xcite is necessary to create a vortex lattice with all vortices rotating in the same direction .    according to the hydrodynamic theory  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the actual particle current in an so - coupled system is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 representing the superfluid velocity and @xmath19 being the normalized spin density vectors . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , while the superfluid velocity contribution @xmath20 is maintained , the gauge term @xmath21 is in direct proportion to the so coupling strength , and will play a dominated role for larger @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the circulating direction of the gauge part @xmath21 and the spin orientation in the vortex core satisfy the left - hand rule [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a)-[fig2](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the opposite chirality between the superfluid velocity and gauge contributions to the particle current can be understood by noting that the opposite directions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 will lead to a minimal particle current @xmath22 , thus require less energy cost than the case for which @xmath20 and @xmath21 are in the same direction . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of chiral circulating current implies that their exists a finite kinetic angular momentum in the ground state  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the kinetic angular momentum can be altered by adjusting the intra - component soft - core interactions , which will also change the magnetization of the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if one exchanges the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the places of the two component condensates will be accordingly swapped in the radial separation , thus the magnetization of the vortex core flips into the opposite direction . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the so coupling fixes the chirality between the spin orientation in the vortex core and the circulating direction of the particle current . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , both the canonical and gauge parts of the kinetic angular momentum reverse their directions , and the orientation of the total kinetic angular momentum carried by a crystal cell is altered from @xmath25 to @xmath26 axis [ see figs  [ fig2](a)-[fig2](b ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> _ _ phase diagram.__we next map out the phase diagram of the many - body ground states spanned by the rashba so coupling and the soft - core interaction strengths . </S>",
    "<S> first we devote to the influences of the soft - core interactions by fixing the so coupling strength at @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that when one of the intra - component soft - core interactions is relatively smaller than the inter - component one with a critical value , the ground state is a spin - polarized superfluid ( spsf ) phase , where all particles condense at the component with weaker intra - component soft - core interaction [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ] . in this spin - polarized case , </S>",
    "<S> the so coupling becomes irrelevant , and the density and phase are uniformly distributed in space with both the spatial translational symmetry and the time - reversal symmetry conserved .    </S>",
    "<S> when the intra - component soft - core interactions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are both stronger than the inter - component soft - core interaction @xmath28 , the ground state prefers a non - chiral supersolid phase . in this phase , both of the components have periodic density modulation with the spatial translational symmetry broken , and form a supersolid crystal . </S>",
    "<S> different from the usual supersolid crystal discovered in a system without so coupling  @xcite , the phase distribution in space is nontrivial , and has a linear gradient along some spontaneous direction , implying the breaking of both time - reversal symmetry and spatial rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> each unit cell of the supersolid crystal is very similar to the plane wave phase discovered in a hard - core system with so coupling  @xcite , as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) , [ fig4](b ) and [ fig4](e ) . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> , we denote this phase as plane - wave supersolid ( pwss ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) . it should be noted that even though there exists a phase gradient for the pwss , representing a finite superfluid velocity , the total particle current is zero because the superfluid velocity part @xmath20 is canceled by the gauge part @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this is very different from the case of css , where the superfluid velocity part and gauge part can not cancel each other . besides </S>",
    "<S> , the css phase is found to be present in the middle interaction region over a wide parameter range as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) .    the strength of the so coupling also plays an important role in determining the phase diagram . for strong enough so coupling strength @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> both the css and spsf phases disappear , and are replaced by another non - chiral supersolid phase as shown in the phase diagram fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) . in this new phase , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of so coupling becomes dominant , leading to the presence of spin stripes within each crystal cell [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) , [ fig4](d ) and [ fig4](f ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> each crystal cell of this supersolid is very similar to the standing wave phase discovered in a hard - core system with so coupling  @xcite , thus we denote this phase as standing - wave supersolid ( swss ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that in the swss phase there exist two types of translational symmetry breaking , with one related to the formation of supersolid crystal , and the other to the formation of stripes within a crystal cell .    </S>",
    "<S> _ _ anomalous phase separation.__in the phase diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) , we find another chiral symmetry broken supersolid phase within the intermediate region of so coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is referred as anomalous chiral supersolid ( acss ) phase , and is distinct from the css phase in two aspects . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the spin texture of the radial phase separation is reversed for the acss state , such that the spin component with weaker intra - component interaction forms a higher - density shell about the one with stronger interaction  [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> for a two - component bec without so coupling , this form of phase separation is in general energetically unfavorable  @xcite , replaced by forming a lower - density shell in the component with stronger interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , such an anomalous structure can be stabilized in the present system with a fairly strong so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by noting that stronger so coupling requires larger angular momentum , which can be more easily sustained by a higher - density shell .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , as the chirality between the spin orientation and the circulating particle current is preserved by the specific form of so coupling , the change in the radial phase separation will induce a change of sign for the angular momentum , which can be read from the canonical part of the angular momentum related to the phase gradient as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . that is to say </S>",
    "<S> , one can alter the direction of the angular momentum by adjusting the so coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> this observation goes beyond the intuitive sense that adjusting so strength can only change the magnitude of the angular momentum .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ rashba vs dresselhaus effects on the chirality.__the emergence of chiral particle current is attributed to the special form of the rashba - type so coupling , which has been previously demonstrated to introduce rigorous mathematical mapping to a chiral magnet with dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question is whether one can change the chirality by changing the type of so coupling from rashba to dresselhaus . in consideration of this </S>",
    "<S> , one recalls that the circulating direction of the particle current is related to the spin matrix vector @xmath29 of the so coupling as @xmath30 . changing the form of so coupling from rashba - type to dresselhaus - type </S>",
    "<S> will be accompanied by a space reflection of the spin along the @xmath31-axis , and lead to a new spin matrix vector @xmath32 . in such case , the gauge part of the particle current is rewritten as @xmath33 , thus may lead to a change of chirality . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations demonstrate that the dresselhaus so coupling lead to an opposite chirality of the particle current with that of the rashba case as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion.__in summary , we have mapped out the ground - state phase diagram of spin - orbit - coupled soft - core bose gases . a surprising </S>",
    "<S> finding is the existence of an exotic chiral supersolid phase , which shows many unique properties : ( ) the chiral symmetry is broken and accompanied by the spontaneous emergence of circulating particle current in each crystal cell . </S>",
    "<S> ( ) the system gains a finite angular momentum in a non - rotating frame , whose direction can be altered by adjusting the strengths of spin - orbit coupling or interatomic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> ( ) in some parameter regions , the chiral supersolid manifests anomalous behaviour of phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> ( ) the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling lead to opposite chiralities in the supersolid . </S>",
    "<S> all of these aspects break through the conventional knowledge of generating angular momentum and phase separation , and bring new perspectives on the physics of spin - orbit coupling and supersolid phenomena .    </S>",
