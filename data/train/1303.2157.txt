    "in the last fifty years our understanding of equilibrium critical phenomena has developed to a point where well established results are available for a range of different situations . in particular ,",
    "the origin of and the difference between equilibrium universality classes is now well understood .",
    "far less is known , however , on the properties of non - equilibrium phase transitions taking place in interacting many - body systems that are far from equilibrium . as for the equilibrium situation ,",
    "a continuous non - equilibrium phase transition is also characterized by a set of critical indices .",
    "absorbing phase transitions encountered in reaction - diffusion systems @xcite and phase transitions found in driven diffusive systems @xcite are well studied examples of continuous phase transitions taking place far from equilibrium . even though the values of the critical exponents have been determined in many cases ,",
    "a classification of non - equilibrium phase transitions into non - equilibrium universality classes is far from complete .",
    "a different type of non - equilibrium criticality is encountered when kinetic ferromagnets are subjected to a periodically oscillating magnetic field @xcite .",
    "when increasing the frequency of the field , a phase transition takes place between a dynamically disordered phase at low frequencies , where the ferromagnet is able to follow the changes of the field , and a dynamically ordered phase at high frequencies , where the magnetic system does not have time to adjust to the magnetic field before it changes its orientation . in the dynamically disordered phase the magnetization oscillates around zero , but in the dynamically ordered phase the magnetization keeps oscillating around a non - vanishing average value",
    "this type of phase transition has been studied in a range of systems , with applications in chemical , physical , and materials systems as well as in ecology , and this both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "most of these studies looked at general properties of the dynamical ordering , without trying to fully characterize the corresponding continuous transition through the determination of the critical indices .",
    "it is only for the two - dimensional kinetic ising model in a periodically oscillating field that the critical exponents have been measured @xcite . interestingly , even though the studied phase transition is a non - equilibrium transition , the values of the exponents were found to coincide with the values of the universality class of the equilibrium two - dimensional ising model .",
    "this result agrees with an earlier conjecture @xcite , based on the symmetry of the problem , as well as with an investigation of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau model with a periodically changing field @xcite . from the symmetry argument given in ref . [ ] one expects also for other cases that this dynamic phase transition falls into the universality class of the equilibrium counterpart , but this has not yet been confirmed .",
    "interestingly , we showed in a recent study @xcite that the above mentioned symmetry argument breaks down when the dynamic phase transition takes place in systems with boundaries , yielding surface critical exponents at the non - equilibrium phase transition that do not coincide with the corresponding equilibrium exponents .    in this short communication we present evidence that also for other bulk systems the dynamic phase transition falls into the corresponding equilibrium universality class",
    "this is done through a study of the critical properties of the kinetic three - dimensional ising model in a square - wave field .    in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss the three - dimensional kinetic ising model and the quantities used to characterize the critical properties at the dynamic phase transition .",

    "the hamiltonian of the three - dimensional kinetic ising model is given by the expression @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the usual ising spin located at site @xmath2 .",
    "the first sum in that expression runs over bonds connecting nearest neighbor spins .",
    "@xmath3 is a ferromagnetic coupling and @xmath4 is a spatially uniform periodically oscillating magnetic field . following [ ] we use a square - wave field of amplitude @xmath5 and half - period @xmath6 . for the data presented in this paper we choose temperature and magnetic field strength so that the system is in the multidroplet regime : @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with the critical temperature @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant ) .",

    "the first five periods are shown for each case .",
    "the red dashed line is @xmath14 where @xmath5 is the amplitude of the magnetic field .",
    "whereas for case ( a ) we are in the dynamically ordered phase , for case ( c ) the system is dynamically disordered . case ( b ) is close to the dynamical phase transition .",
    "the parameters are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the system contains @xmath15 spins .",
    "the unit of time is one monte carlo step .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    let us pause briefly in order to summarize the mechanism underlying the dynamical ordering observed in the kinetic ferromagnets , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . assuming the magnetization being aligned with the external field , a reversing of the direction of the field results in a metastable state from which the system tries to escape by nucleating droplets that are pointing in the same direction as the field .",
    "whereas in the dynamically disordered phase , the ferromagnet is able to reverse its magnetization before the field is changed again , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , in the dynamically ordered phase the system is still in the metastable state when the field direction switches back , thereby yielding a time dependent magnetization that oscillates around a finite value , as shown in fig .",
    "this competition between the magnetic field and the metastable state is captured by the variable @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the metastable lifetime . for the kinetic ising model @xmath18",
    "plays the same role as that played by temperature in the equilibrium system . changing @xmath6 changes the value of @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , there is a critical value @xmath19 where the dynamic phase transition between the dynamically ordered and the dynamically disordered phases takes place , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b .    in order to determine the metastable lifetime we consider an equilibrated system in a field of constant strength @xmath5 . reversing the sign of the field",

    "the unit of time is one monte carlo step .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to elucidate the critical properties of the dynamic phase transition we study a range of different quantities .",
    "the main quantity of interest is the period - averaged magnetization @xmath21 where the integration is performed over one period of the oscillating field .",
    "the time dependent magnetization is given by @xmath22 we thereby consider cubic systems with periodic boundary conditions and linear extend @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath25 is then obtained after averaging both over time ( i.e. an average over many periods ) and over different realizations of the noise .",
    "some quantities of interest are directly obtained from the order parameter .",
    "thus we calculate the binder cumulant @xmath26 that we use to determine the critical point , see section iii .",
    "the susceptibility describing the fluctuations of the order parameter is given by @xmath27 we also calculated the period - averaged energy @xmath28 and its fluctuations @xmath29    close to the critical point , the order parameter and the response functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 display an algebraic behavior : @xmath32 with the critical exponents @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "as a necessary prerequisite for a reliable determination of the critical exponents we need to know the location of the critical point with high precision . as usual for continuous phase transitions",
    "the various quantities show a characteristic behavior in finite systems when approaching the critical point .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the binder cumulant , the order parameter , as well as for the fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "even though one can get an estimate for the critical value @xmath19 by analyzing the shift of the maximum of the susceptibility when changing the system size , the most reliable way to determine the critical point is to study the binder cumulant . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , for the kinetic three - dimensional ising model the data sets obtained for different system sizes all cross at a common value @xmath36 .",
    "this value being compatible with the finite - size shifts of the position of the maxima in @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we take this value as the critical value @xmath19 where the dynamic phase transition takes place .",

    "in addition , the susceptibility displays in the finite systems a maximum close to that value of @xmath18 . the data result from averaging over typically 100000 periods .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to determine the values of the critical exponents , we perform a finite - size scaling analysis @xcite , similar to what has been done previously for the two - dimensional kinetic ising model @xcite .",
    "close to the critical point systems of different sizes should display the following scaling behavior : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the reduced control parameter and @xmath40 is the critical exponent describing the divergence of the correlation length when approaching the critical point .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are scaling functions , where the sign @xmath44 correspond to @xmath45 .",
    "comparison of data obtained at the critical point @xmath46 should yield for all three quantities an algebraic dependence on the system size , which allows to directly determine the critical exponents from the slopes in a double logarithmic plot .",
    "[ h ]   ( a ) order parameter @xmath47 , ( b ) order parameter susceptibility @xmath30 , and ( c ) energy fluctuations @xmath31 at the critical point @xmath46 as a function of system size .",

    "[ fig4 ] all three quantities indeed depend algebraically on the system size . from the slopes",
    "we obtain the values @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ( for the specific heat we did not take into account the largest system size , due to the rather poor quality of the data ) . comparing these values with the well known equilibrium values for the three - dimensional ising model @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57",
    ", we see that the set of exponents we obtain for the dynamic phase transition of the kinetic ising model indeed agree with the equilibrium values @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",

    "[ ] is also valid in three space dimensions .",
    "classifying and understanding universality classes of non - equilibrium phase transitions remains an important task .",
    "for some types of systems , as for example absorbing phase transitions , field theoretical methods can be used successfully , which then allow not only to calculate critical quantities but also to understand what features of a given system are universal . still , the classification of non - equilibrium universality classes is far from complete , and much work remains to be done before a more complete understanding of the origin of universality far from equilibrium is achieved .",
    "the dynamic phase transition encountered in magnetic systems in an oscillating field constitutes an interesting case .",
    "indeed , it was shown that for the two - dimensional kinetic ising model the critical exponents at this non - equilibrium phase transition coincide with those of the equilibrium ising model @xcite .",
    "this result is supported by a symmetry argument @xcite . on the other hand , the presence of surfaces results in non - equilibrium surface universality classes that differ from those encountered in the equilibrium semi - infinite ising model @xcite .",
    "in this work we have shown that also for the dynamic phase transition in the three - dimensional kinetic ising model the same critical exponents as for the three - dimensional equilibrium model are obtained .",
    "this lends further support to the symmetry argument given in [ ] .",
