    "the extended continuum emission is likely to correspond to thermal dust emission , which could contain additional dust cores in the irs1 region .",
    "it is also plausible that the sw extension corresponds to a dust component which is located along the interface between the ionized and molecular medium and is compressed by the ionized outflow .",
    "the carma image at 3.4 mm ( figure 1c ) shows a point - like source with no significant detection of the sw extension .",

    "the carma 1.3-mm image ( figure 1d ) , convolved to a circular beam of 01 , shows a central emission peak with a flux density of 1.0@xmath150.1 jy beam@xmath6 .",
    "the innermost part of the hc   region at 1.3 mm is un - resolved , which could be the optically thick part of the ionized outflow containing an accretion disk in irs 1 . because the optically thick free - free emission dominates the 1.3-mm continuum , as well as the limitation of the angular resolution",
    ", the postulated ionized disk in irs1 has not been detected . in the carma 1.3-mm image ( figure 1d ) , extensions along the south and north directions from the bright point source has been revealed with a scale of 08 above a noise level of 4 @xmath17 .",
    "the emitting lobes appear to be from the inner portion of the ionized outflow .",

    "figure 2 compares the carma 1.3-mm image with previous vla images . at wavelengths",
    "@xmath18 cm , a dark lane divides two emission peaks in the center of the irs1 region , which is probably due to the self - absorption in the ionized gas . at shorter wavelengths , @xmath19 mm , a single emission peak appears , located at r.a .",

    "at 1.3-mm wavelength , the sma data for ngc7538irs1 show numerous strong molecular emission lines along with a few absorption features .",
    "a large portion of the emission is from the molecular lines with high excitation energy levels ( e.g. ocs , ch@xmath2cn , ch@xmath2och@xmath2 and c@xmath20h@xmath21oh ) , showing a strong emission peak at a radial velocity of @xmath22 km s@xmath6 with a scatter of about one channel width ( @xmath00.5 km s@xmath6 ) .",

    "the gaussian fitting shows an average peak velocity of @xmath24 km s@xmath6 for these lines .",
    "these lines are with higher excitation energy than the ones observed in the 1.3-mm sma data , as well as lower optical depths ( for the two rare isotopic ones ) . on the other hand , since the @xmath02angular resolution of the 0.86-mm observations is poor compared to the 1.3-mm observations , it is possible that the 0.86-mm emission includes the kinematics of surrounding medium ( e.g. , outflow , infall ) .",
    "therefore , considering the results of all the observations we adopt @xmath25 km s@xmath6 , as the systemic velocity of the irs1 system in the following analysis .",

    "multiple @xmath27 transitions of ch@xmath2cn(12 - 11 ) included in both ext and vex configuration observations were selected in our analysis to determine the excitation condition and kinematics in the irs1 region .",
    "the channel maps of the ocs(19 - 18 ) line show two significant velocity components in ocs(19 - 18 ) emission ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the main ocs(19 - 18 ) emission component in the velocity range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 km s@xmath6 is referred to as irs1 sw as it is located to the south and southwest of the hc region irs1 , while the fainter , less extended redshifted component , hereafter irs1 ne , is located to the northeast of irs1 ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "no significant ocs(19 - 18 ) emission is present in the velocity range between @xmath32 and @xmath33 km  s@xmath6 .",

    "the total integrated line flux of ocs(19 - 18 ) for irs1 sw ( @xmath38 jy km s@xmath6 ) is about three times of the value for irs1 ne ( @xmath39 jy km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "figure 6b shows the line profiles of the ocs(19 - 18 ) spectra at the peak positions of irs1 sw and ne , and figure 6c shows the spectral profile integrated over the entire irs1 region .",

    "the centroid velocity of irs 1 sw is close to @xmath26 km s@xmath6 used in this paper , suggesting that ambient gas might dominate this component .",
    "the spectrum of irs 1 ne is not a well - defined gaussian shape , and the large line width suggests that it is subject to more dynamic interaction than irs1 sw .",

    "similar to what is seen in ocs(19 - 18 ) , the ch@xmath2cn(12 - 11 ) lines also show an emission peak at @xmath46 km s@xmath6 with weaker redshifted components . at the intensity peak of irs 1 sw",
    ", the line profiles of @xmath27=0 - 8 transitions are shown in figure 7a and b , while as for irs 1 ne , only @xmath27=0 - 7 transitions are detected above 3-@xmath17 level .",
    "the @xmath27=0 and @xmath27=1 transitions , however , only have a frequency difference of 4.25 mhz ( @xmath05.8 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "we used double - component gaussian models to fit the @xmath27=0 , 1 line profiles for sw and ne respectively , which give uncertainties of 10% for sw and 15% for ne in line fluxes .",
    "another issue is that the velocity separation between @xmath27=0 and 1 transitions is comparable to the velocity difference of the emission peaks toward sw and ne . with our sub - arcsec resolution ,",
    "irs 1 ne and sw are only marginally separated , therefore the blending of the main @xmath27=1 emission from irs1 sw with the redshifted @xmath27=0 emission from irs1 ne is expected . due to the contamination caused by the blending",
    ", the transition of @xmath27=0 toward irs1 ne should be used with caution in the following analysis . as figure 7b shows , the @xmath27=0 and @xmath27=2 transitions from irs 1 sw are quite weak toward irs 1 ne . assuming that the main @xmath27=1 emission from irs 1 sw has a similar intensity , we estimate that about 15% of the observed intensity of the redshifted @xmath27=0 emission toward irs 1 ne is actually contributed by the blending from the main @xmath27=1 emission . toward irs 1",
    "sw the error of the main @xmath27=1 emission due to the blending from the redshifted @xmath27=0 emission is negligible .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath27=3 component for both irs1 ne and sw is abnormally low compared to the other @xmath27 components under the assumption that the ch@xmath2cn components are in local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) , homogeneous and optically thin .",
    "as shown in figure 7a and b for the sw component , the peak intensity of the @xmath27=0 - 4 transitions are nearly identical , indicating that the low @xmath27 transitions of ch@xmath2cn in the sw component are optically thick .",
    "the optical depth of @xmath27=3 component is even higher due to its doubled statistical weight .",
    "thus , the optically thick components must be excluded in the fitting for kinetic temperature with the assumption of optically thin and lte ( see section 4.5 ) .",
    "in addition , we noticed that the intensity of the @xmath27=6 component toward irs1 ne is higher than the other components including @xmath27=3 , 4 , 5 and 7 .",
    "this could be attributed to two causes .",
    "first , the @xmath27=6 component has a much higher column density than the components of @xmath27=4 and 5 due to its doubled statistic weight , but it still remains optically thin compared to the components of @xmath27=0 , 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "second , the intensity of the @xmath27=6 component toward irs1 ne is likely to be affected by the line blending with hnco(10@xmath47 - 9@xmath48 ) at rest frequency @xmath49 ghz from sw and ch@xmath50cn(12@xmath2 - 11@xmath2 ) at @xmath51 ghz from ne itself . from the comparison of figure 7b and 7d",
    ", it seems that these possible line blending caused a non - zero baseline in the frequency range from 220.58 to 220.61 ghz toward ne , which might contribute up to 20% to the measured peak intensity of @xmath27=6 component of ch@xmath2cn(12 - 11 ) .",
    "the possible blending from weaker molecular lines is also examined .",
    "we noticed that the line frequencies of c@xmath20h@xmath21oh are close to the @xmath27=1 , 3 and 4 transitions of ch@xmath2cn(12 - 11 ) and a ch@xmath2ocho - e line close to @xmath27=3 transition of ch@xmath2cn(12 - 11 ) .",
    "however , according to the jpl catalog , the typical intensities of those lines are only a few percent of the ch@xmath2cn lines , and the contamination would produce no significant effects .",
    "we constructed line images for each @xmath27 transition ( not shown in this paper ) and fitted the intensity peak positions for both the irs1 sw and ne components based on the integrated line flux images of @xmath27=0 - 8 .",
    "we also fitted the line profiles of each @xmath27 transition to determine their peak intensities ( @xmath52 ) , centroid velocity ( @xmath53 ) and fwhm line width ( @xmath54 ) . the derived values for these quantities",
    "are summarized in table 4 .",
    "taking the strong transitions @xmath27=2 - 5 , with no blending , we combined the visibility data of the four transitions in the lsr - velocity domain to construct the channel maps of ch@xmath2cn(12 - 11 ) ( figure 8) , which is equivalent to averaging the line intensities from the @xmath27=2 - 5 transitions .",

    "some of the @xmath27 components of ch@xmath2cn(12 - 11 ) are obviously optically thick ( see section 4.4 ) .",
    "therefore , we made iterations in fitting the rotation temperature .",
    "first , higher @xmath27 components ( @xmath27=4 , 5 , 7 and 8 for sw , and @xmath27=4 , 5 , and 7 for ne ) were assumed to be optically thin and used in the initial fitting with equation ( 1 ) by eliminating the optical - depth term @xmath75 .",
    "the initial fitting gave a rotation temperature @xmath76 and a total column density @xmath77 , with which the corresponding optical depths @xmath78 and optical - depth - correction factors @xmath79 were derived for each @xmath27 components .",
    "in the following iterations , we used @xmath80 to correct the observed surface column densities @xmath81 and added the other @xmath27 components to the fitting . to avoid the bias caused by the optically thick @xmath27 components ,",
    "their weighting in the fitting was inversely proportional to their deviations from the fitting curve of the previous iteration .",

    "the density of the environment is much higher to the south of irs1 ; thus the molecular emission from irs1 sw is stronger , and the ionized outflow in this direction is highly confined .",
    "the redshifted radial velocity of irs1 ne could also be due to rotation of the wide - angle outflow around its axis .",
    "an ionized outflow which rotates around its axis could entrain the adjacent molecular gas , and consequently , the impact of the ionized outflow on the circumstellar gas could produce highly - excited molecular species at the positions of irs1 ne and sw .",
    "the ambient density is higher to the south and sw of irs1 , so the entrainment of the ionized jet is not significant . to the north of irs1 ,",
    "the density is lower , and the ionized outflow can penetrate and produce significant redshifted movement of the entrained gas ne of irs1 .",
    "we can roughly estimate the angular momentum of the ne component to be 3.6@xmath9010@xmath198 m@xmath187 m@xmath199 s@xmath6 by assuming a mass @xmath200 m@xmath187 ( see section 4.5 ) , rotation velocity @xmath201 km s@xmath6 , and radius @xmath202 au ( @xmath203 , see table 4 ) .",
    "the angular momentum input to irs1 is about 5.7@xmath9010@xmath195 m@xmath187 m@xmath199 s@xmath6 yr@xmath6 with an infall rate of 5@xmath9010@xmath176 m@xmath187 yr@xmath6 , a radius of 1900 au ( @xmath007 ) and an enclosed mass of 30 m@xmath187 .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that the ionized outflow could cause the observed redshifted movement of the component ne in the lifetime of the accretion process .",
    "using sub - arcsec resolution observations at 1.3 and 3.4 mm with sma and carma , we analyzed the molecular lines and continuum emission from ngc7538irs1 to investigate the dynamic processes related to the star - forming activities in this region . with an image",
    "convolved to 01 from carma b - array observation at 1.3 mm , the primary continuum source irs 1 , an hc region , was resolved into two components , an unresolved compact core with a linear size @xmath1 au and a north - south extended lobe of the ionized outflow in agreement with the predicted extrapolation of a power - law dependence made by @xcite .",
    "both the sma and carma show extended dust continuum emission to the sw of irs1 , which might indicate a reservoir of molecular gas .",
    "the molecular lines ocs(19 - 18 ) , ch@xmath2cn(12 - 11 ) and @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) , show that dense molecular gas is primarily distributed southwest to northeast across irs1 with an angular size of @xmath02@xmath901 .",
    "the locations and velocities of the molecular clumps suggest that they might be heated by interaction between the ionized outflow from irs1 and the adjacent molecular gas in a rotating wide - angle outflow in a n - s direction from irs1 .    from high - resolution ( 08@xmath9006 )",
    "observations of @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) , co(2 - 1 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) , we fitted multiple gaussian velocity components to the spectra toward the continuum sources in irs 1 .",
    "we found that the significant molecular lines in absorption are redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity toward irs 1 , suggesting that a large amount of material surrounding the region is infalling toward irs1 .",
    "an infall rate of @xmath03 - 10@xmath9010@xmath176 m@xmath187 y@xmath6 was inferred from @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) lines .",

    "<S> @xmath0 07 , the sma and carma observations show that the continuum emission at 1.3 and 3.4 mm from the hyper - compact region irs1 is dominated by a compact source with a tail - like extended structure to the southwest of irs1 . with a carma b - array image at 1.3 mm </S>",
    "<S> convolved to 01 , we resolve the hyper - compact region into two components : an unresolved hyper - compact core , and a north - south extension with linear sizes of @xmath1 au and @xmath02000 au , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fine structure observed with carma is in good agreement with the previous vla results at centimeter wavelengths , suggesting that the hyper - compact region at the center of irs1 is associated with an ionized bipolar outflow . </S>",
    "<S> we image the molecular lines ocs(19 - 18 ) and ch@xmath2cn(12 - 11 ) as well as @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) surrounding irs1 , showing a velocity gradient along the southwest - northeast direction . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral line profiles in @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) , co(2 - 1 ) , and hcn(1 - 0 ) observed toward irs1 show broad redshifted absorption , providing evidence for gas infall with rates in the range of @xmath4 m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 inferred from our observations . </S>"
