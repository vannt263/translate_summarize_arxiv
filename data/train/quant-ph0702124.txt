    "over the last two decades , a number of authors have expressed the view that our efforts to develop an understanding of quantum theory are impeded by a lack of understanding of the physical origin of the quantum formalism , and that our efforts would thereby be significantly aided by a systematic derivation of the formalism from a set of physically comprehensible assumptions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several authors have proposed that the concept of information may be the key , hitherto missing , ingredient which , if appropriately applied and formalized , might make such a derivation possible  @xcite .    the proposal that information might enable a derivation of quantum formalism rests , to a significant degree , upon the recognition that the concept of information plays a new and fundamental role in quantum physics .",
    "one way to see this is as follows . in classical physics",
    ", an experimenter presented with a system in an unknown state can , in principle , perform an ideal measurement upon the system which gives perfect knowledge about the state of the system .",
    "hence , there is no fundamental distinction between the state and an ideal experimenter s _ knowledge _ of the state . in quantum physics",
    ", however , an ideal measurement  ( or even a finite number of such measurements performed upon an ensemble of identically - prepared systems ) provides only partial knowledge about the unknown state of a quantum system . hence , in sharp contrast to the situation in classical physics , a fundamental distinction is drawn between the state and the knowledge that the experimenter can conceivably have of it . the concept of information then immediately assumes a fundamental role through the natural attempt to quantitatively _ relate _ the two :  ` how much information has been obtained by the experimenter about the state ? '",
    "one of the earliest attempts to explore the role of information is due to wootters  @xcite .",
    "suppose that alice has a stern - gerlach apparatus oriented at angle  @xmath0 , and attempts to communicate the angle  @xmath1 to bob using spin-@xmath2 particles as follows .",
    "alice prepares  @xmath3 spin-@xmath2 particles in the state  @xmath4 using her stern - gerlach apparatus , and sends the particles to bob , who measures them using a vertically - aligned stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "the data he obtains provides information about the outcome probabilities ,  @xmath5 , of the measurement , where  @xmath6 is the probability of a spin emerging in the positive channel .",
    "since , from quantum theory ,  @xmath7 , bob thereby gains information about  @xmath1 .",
    "however , we can now ask the question :  suppose we did not know quantum theory , and instead simply regard the experimental arrangement as a way for bob to learn about  @xmath1 by observing the frequencies of the two possible outcomes of his stern - gerlach apparatus ; what function  @xmath8 would maximize the amount of information obtained by bob about  @xmath1 for given  @xmath3 ? wootters finds that , if the information is quantified using the shannon information measure , then , in the limit as  @xmath9 , the function is  @xmath10 , where  @xmath11 , a generalized form of malus law , which includes the correct result as a special case .",
    "wootters result is remarkable since it shows that , using the standard inferential methods of probability theory and the well - established shannon information measure , and taking an operational approach that assumes the probabilistic nature of measurement outcomes , it is possible to make a correct , non - trivial physical prediction concerning a quantum experiment from a plausible information - theoretic principle .",
    "however , wootters attempt to generalize this result in the direction of the quantum formalism meets with limited success .",
    "more recently , other attempts  @xcite have been made to examine and quantify the gain of information in the measurement process , and which differ in various ways from wootters approach , but which are also able to derive the generalized form of malus law .",
    "however , as with wootters approach , they are unable to generalize their results to obtain a significant part of the quantum formalism .    in contrast , several other recent approaches  @xcite which involve the concept of information succeed in deriving a significant fraction of the quantum formalism . however , at the outset , these approaches make abstract assumptions of key importance which are given no physical interpretation , and which detract from the understanding of the physical origin of the quantum formalism that can thereby be obtained . for instance , in the approach described in  @xcite",
    ", it is shown that , provided one assumes that a complex number is associated with each suitably - defined experimental set - up , feynman s rules  @xcite for combining complex probability amplitudes can be derived from a set of plausible consistency conditions .",
    "however , the choice of number field is not given a physical interpretation , and an alternative choice of field , such as the reals or quaternions , would lead to a different set of rules . in the approaches described in  @xcite ,",
    "a similar choice regarding the applicable number field is made at the outset  -algebraic framework , which employs the complex number field , and  ( b )  grinbaum s axiom vii  @xcite makes specific assumptions regarding the applicable number fields . ] .    in this paper and a companion paper  @xcite  ( hereafter referred to as paper  ii ) , we attempt to build upon the insights provided by wootters approach , and formulate an information - theoretic principle and a set of physically comprehensible assumptions from which it is possible to derive the standard formalism of quantum theory .",
    "in particular , we obtain the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism , namely  ( a )  the von neumann postulates for finite - dimensional systems , ( b )  the tensor product rule for expressing the state of a composite system in terms of the states of its sub - systems , and ( c )  the result due to wigner that any symmetry transformation of a quantum system can be represented by a unitary or antiunitary transformation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we obtain the formal rules of quantum theory  , such as the canonical commutation relations , which are necessary to apply the abstract formalism to obtain concrete models of particular experimental set - ups .",
    "we proceed as follows .    first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : f - idealised - set - up ] , we describe an idealized , abstract experimental set - up , which provides a general framework within which particular experimental set - ups can be described . the preparations , interactions , and measurements that are permitted in a given set - up are defined in an operational manner .",
    "this makes it possible to operationally specify set - ups , where , like those set - ups ordinarily considered in quantum theory , the preparation provides the maximum possible control over the system insofar as predictions about the outcome probabilities of the measurement are concerned , and the interactions only affect the degrees of freedom of the state of the system that are under control of the preparation .",
    "second , in sec .",
    "[ sec : f - statement - of - postulates ] , we present a set of postulates which concern the behavior of measurements performed on the system , and which determine the theoretical representation of measurements , the state of the system , and physical transformations of the system .",
    "the postulates are formulated so as to be physically comprehensible , and an analysis of their comprehensibility is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : overview ] .",
    "the key postulate is the _ principle of information gain _ , which expresses the idea that , although different measurements yield different information about the state of a system , they nonetheless provide the same _ amount _ of information about the state .",
    "that is , although different measurements provide different perspectives on a system , none is informationally privileged with respect to any other .",
    "third , in sec .  [ sec : d ] , we show that , within the framework provided by the abstract set - up , these postulates are sufficient to derive the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism , apart from the form of the temporal evolution operator . in paper",
    "ii , we formulate an additional principle , the _ average - value correspondence principle _ , with which we obtain the form of the temporal evolution operator and the formal rules of quantum theory .",
    "in the course of the derivation , we find that the concept of information , via the principle of information gain , gives rise to a number of the key features of the quantum formalism , such as the importance of square - roots of probability  ( real amplitudes ) and the sinusoidal variation of probability with parameters , and plays a key role in the restriction of possible transformations of state space to unitary and antiunitary transformations .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] with a discussion of the results .",
    "in this section , we shall first present an idealized , abstract experimental set - up , which provides a general framework within which particular experimental set - ups can be described .",
    "we shall then state a set of postulates which determines the abstract theoretical model of the abstract experimental set - up .",
    "the description of an experimental set - up in a manner sufficiently precise to enable modeling using the quantum formalism involves the use of terms that are particular to the abstract language of the quantum formalism .",
    "for example , one speaks of a set - up that prepares a system in a _ pure state _ , but the concept of a pure state has a specialized meaning which presupposes the quantum formalism .",
    "however , since our goal is to derive the formalism , our first task is to devise a way of defining , with sufficient precision , what constitutes an experimental set - up without making reference to such terms .    at the outset , we shall adopt , as background assumptions , the following idealizations drawn from classical physics :    * _ partitioning_. the universe is partitioned into a system , the background environment  ( or simply , the  _ background _ )  the background environment of a systems is , by definition , that part of the environment of a system which non - trivially influences the behavior of the system , but which is not reciprocally affected by the system .",
    "for example , if a planet in the gravitational field of a star is modeled as a test particle in a fixed gravitational field of the star , then the planet  ( test particle ) is the system , and the gravitational field is its background .",
    "if a part of the environment is reciprocally affected by the system , the system is enlarged to include this part of the environment .",
    "for example , if the reciprocal affect of the planet on the star is relevant , the system is enlarged to include the star , and the star and planet are regarded as interacting sub - systems within the enlarged system . of the system , measuring apparatuses , and the rest of the universe . * _ time_. in a given frame of reference , one can speak of a physical time which is common to the system and its background , and which is represented by a real - valued parameter ,  @xmath12 . * _ states . _ at any time , the system is in a definite physical state , whose mathematical description is called the mathematical state , or simply the _ state _ , of the system .",
    "the state space of the system is the set of all possible states of the system .",
    "the general abstract experimental set - up that we shall consider is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : idealised - set - up ] .",
    "a _ source _ provides identical copies of a physical system of interest . a _ preparation step _ either selects or rejects the incoming system . in a particular run of the experiment ,",
    "a physical system from the source passes the preparation , and is then subject to a _",
    "measurement _ or _",
    "measurements_. in addition , following the preparation , the system may undergo an _ interaction _ with a physical apparatus .",
    "we shall only consider set - ups which satisfy particular idealizations .",
    "in particular , we shall restrict consideration to measurements that have the following properties :    * _ finiteness _ :  the measurements yield a finite number of possible outcomes , * _ distinctness _ :  the possible outcomes of a measurement have distinct values , * _ repetition consistency _ :  when a measurement is immediately repeated , the same outcome is observed with certainty , and * _ classicality _ :  the measurements do not involve auxiliary quantum systems .",
    "in addition , we shall assume that interactions have the following properties :    * _ identity - preserving _ :  the interactions preserve the identity of the system , and * _ reversible and deterministic _ :  the interactions are reversible and deterministic at the level of the state of the system , and so can be represented as one - to - one maps over state space .",
    "we shall also assume that the background of the system can be adequately modeled within the classical framework insofar as its internal dynamics is concerned .",
    "for example , in the case of a system in a background electromagnetic field , the field is assumed to be modeled classically .",
    "similarly , we shall assume that parameters which determine the measurement being performed  ( the orientation of a stern - gerlach apparatus , for instance ) are described classically as real - valued numbers .",
    "in short , it is assumed that the non - classicality is entirely concentrated in the system and in its interactions with the background and the measurement devices .",
    "the essential purpose of the experimental set - up illustrated in fig .",
    "1 is to allow some property of a physical system to be studied under controlled conditions  .",
    "ideally , one would like to prepare the system such that , immediately following the preparation , one has as much knowledge as possible about the degrees of freedom of the state of the system that are relevant to the property under study , and one would like to interact with the system so that only these degrees of freedom are affected .",
    "for example , if one wishes to study the spin properties of a system , one would prepare the system so that its spin direction is fixed  ( in classical physics ) , or its state is pure  ( in quantum physics ) .",
    "similarly , one would allow uniform @xmath13-field interactions since these only affect the spin degrees of freedom of the system , but non - uniform @xmath13-field interactions would be excluded since they couple spin and spatial degrees of freedom , and since spatial degrees of freedom are not under control of the preparation .",
    "now , ordinarily , we rely upon a particular physical theory to tell us which preparations are _ maximal _ with respect to a given measurement in the sense that they provide us with as much control as physically possible over the degrees of freedom of the state of the system that are relevant to predictions concerning the outcomes of the given measurement , and which interactions are _ compatible _ with the preparation and measurement in the sense of only affecting the degrees of freedom that are under control of the preparation . however , since our goal is to derive the abstract quantum formalism , where measurements and interactions are treated purely in the abstract , it is necessary to find a way to establish _ when _ a preparation is maximal with respect to a given measurement , and when an interaction is compatible with a preparation and measurement , in a correspondingly abstract manner .",
    "to do so , we make use of the fact that , in both classical and quantum physics , a preparation is maximal with respect to a given measurement if and only if the preparation is _ complete _ in that it renders the history of the system prior to the preparation irrelevant insofar as predictions concerning the measurement outcomes are concerned .",
    "for example , in classical physics , if a preparation places a system in a precisely known state  ( which is , in principle , possible ) , one has maximal degree of control over the state , and the results of subsequent measurements performed on the system are independent of the history of the system prior to the preparation , so that the preparation is also complete .",
    "the converse is also true .    in quantum physics ,",
    "one encounters a similar situation .",
    "for example , consider an experimental set - up where , in each run , a spin-1/2 system undergoes a preparation by a stern - gerlach measurement device , and subsequently undergoes a stern - gerlach measurement . from quantum theory , we know that the preparation in this case is maximal with respect to the subsequent stern - gerlach measurement , and we also know that the outcome probabilities of the measurement are independent of the pre - preparation history of the spin-1/2 system , so that the preparation is also complete .",
    "the converse is also true . more generally , if the preparation of a quantum system is maximal with respect to a given projective measurement , then we know from quantum theory that a system is prepared in a pure state , so that the preparation is also complete with respect to the measurement ; and conversely .",
    "now , most importantly , unlike the notion of maximality , it is straightforward to operationalize the notion of completeness :",
    "continuing with the example of the spin-@xmath2 experiment , if one models the data obtained from the measurement in  @xmath3 runs of the experiment using a probabilistic source  , one finds that , in the limit of large  @xmath3 , the outcome probabilities of the source are independent of arbitrary pre - preparation interactions   with the system .    using this operationally - defined notion of completeness as a basis",
    ", we shall see below that it is possible to give precise expression to the idea that , roughly speaking , a pair of measurements are examining the same property of the system from different perspectives , and that an interaction is only manipulating this particular property of the system .",
    "the measurements employed in the abstract set - up are chosen from a _ measurement set _",
    ",  @xmath14 .",
    "as mentioned previously , it will be assumed that each measurement has the property of finiteness , which we shall now operationalize by saying that , when the measurement is carried out on a system which has been emitted from the source and has undergone arbitrary interactions thereafter , the measurement generates one of a finite number of _ possible outcomes _ , a possible outcome being defined as one that has a non - zero probability of occurrence .",
    "it will also be assumed that the measurement detectors do not absorb the systems that they detect .",
    "a preparation consists of a measurement that determines to which outcome the incoming system belongs , followed by the selection of the system if the measurement registers a given outcome , and the rejection of the system otherwise .",
    "if detectors that do not absorb the detected systems are unavailable , a preparation can instead be implemented using a measurement where one of the detectors is removed .",
    "consider now an experiment  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : idealised - set - up ] ) in which a system from a source is subject to a preparation consisting of measurement ,  @xmath15 , with  @xmath16 possible outcomes , with outcome  @xmath17 selected  ( @xmath18 ) , followed by measurement  @xmath19  ( with  @xmath20 possible outcomes ) , without an interaction in the intervening time .",
    "suppose that the data obtained in  @xmath3 runs of the experiment are modeled by a probabilistic source with  @xmath20 possible outcomes , whose most likely probabilities  ( calculated on the basis of the data ) are given by  @xmath21 , where  @xmath22 is the probability of the  @xmath23th outcome  @xmath24  . , the modeling process can be formalized using standard methods of bayesian data analysis .",
    "see  @xcite , for example , for a general discussion on the subject . ]",
    "if , for all  @xmath17 , @xmath25 is independent of arbitrary pre - preparation interactions with the system in the limit of large  @xmath3 , the preparation will be said to be _ complete _ with respect to measurement  @xmath19 .",
    "if the completeness condition also holds true when  @xmath19 and  @xmath26 are interchanged , then  @xmath19 and  @xmath26 will be said to form a _",
    "measurement pair_.    the set of measurements _ generated _ by  @xmath27 forms a measurement set ,  @xmath14 , which is defined as the set of all measurements that  ( i ) form a measurement pair with  @xmath19 and that  ( ii ) are not a composite of other measurements in  @xmath14",
    ". an important corollary of this definition is that two measurement sets are either identical or disjoint .",
    "interactions that occur after the preparation step are chosen from an _ interaction set _ ,",
    "@xmath28 , which is defined as follows .",
    "suppose that , in the experiment of fig .",
    "[ fig : idealised - set - up ] , an interaction ,  @xmath29 , occurs between the preparation and measurement .",
    "if , for all  @xmath30 , the preparation remains complete with respect to the subsequent measurement , then  @xmath29 will be said to be _ compatible _ with  @xmath14 and the source .",
    "the set  @xmath28 is then defined as the set of all such compatible interactions .",
    "if there are two experimental set - ups , each with a source containing identical copies of the same physical system , with respective disjoint measurement sets ,  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 , then the set - ups will be said to be _ disjoint_. this makes precise the rough notion that the set - ups examine different aspects of the same physical system .      to illustrate the above definitions , consider again the spin-1/2 experiment , where silver atoms emerge from a source  ( an evaporator ) , pass through a stern - gerlach preparation device ,",
    "undergo an interaction , and finally undergo a stern - gerlach measurement . in this case , the set ,  @xmath14 , generated by any stern - gerlach measurement consists of all stern - gerlach measurements of the form  @xmath33 , where  @xmath0 is the orientation of the stern - gerlach device .",
    "however , measurements that are composed of two or more stern - gerlach measurements are excluded from  @xmath14 .",
    "consider now an interaction ,  @xmath34 , consisting of a uniform @xmath13-field acting during the interval  @xmath35 $ ] in some direction  @xmath36 .",
    "if such an interaction occurs between the preparation and measurement , one finds that the completeness of the preparation with respect to the measurement is preserved ; that is , the interaction is compatible with  @xmath14 and the system .",
    "hence , all interactions in which a uniform magnetic field acts between the preparation and measurement are in the interaction set ,  @xmath28 .",
    "however , interactions consisting of a non - uniform @xmath13-field do not preserve completeness  ( viewed from the quantum theoretic model , such interactions couple the spin and position degrees of freedom of the system ) , and are therefore excluded from  @xmath28 .    finally , to illustrate the concept of disjoint set - ups , consider a source which emits a system consisting of two distinguishable spin-1/2 particles on each run of an experiment , and consider two set - ups where the first set - up has a measurement set  @xmath31 consisting of all possible stern - gerlach measurements performed on one of the particles , and the second has a measurement set  @xmath32 consisting of all possible stern - gerlach measurements performed on the other particle . in this case , the two measurement sets are disjoint .",
    "the set - ups themselves are accordingly said to be disjoint , which precisely expresses the notion that the two set - ups are examining distinct aspects of the same physical system .",

    "for the purposes of discussion , it is helpful to distinguish two _ levels _ of physical comprehensibility",
    ". first , at the minimum , a comprehensible postulate is one that can be transparently understood as a simple assertion about the physical world .",
    "if this is the case , we shall say that the postulate has the property of _",
    "transparency_. second , a postulate has an additional level of comprehensibility if it can also be traced to well - established experimental facts and physical ideas or principles  ( _ traceability _ ) .    to illustrate these ideas ,",
    "consider the example of einstein s postulate of the constancy of the speed of light .",
    "the postulate can be transparently understood as the simple assertion that measurements of the speed of light in different inertial frames will yield the same result .",
    "in addition , the postulate can also be understood as a direct generalization of the well - established results of the michelson - morley experiment , the generalization being achieved by an appeal to the general principle of the uniformity of nature .",
    "hence , the postulate is both transparent and traceable .",
    "since the assumptions underlying classical physics are transparent and traceable to well - established experimental facts and theoretical ideas , and since these assumptions remain fundamental to the way in which we conceptualize the physical world , we attempt to preserve them as far as possible in the face of quantum phenomena .",
    "accordingly , we draw the majority of the postulates from classical physics , either by taking fundamental features of the theoretical framework of classical physics and modifying these , if necessary , in light of experimental facts that are characteristic of quantum phenomena , or by transposing particular features of the classical models of physical systems into the quantum realm via a classical  quantum correspondence argument . furthermore , in our treatment of information , we use the standard inferential methods of probability theory , and employ the conceptually and mathematically well - established framework of shannon information theory . the remaining assumptions , which have no obvious classical counterparts , are based on experimental facts that are characteristic of quantum phenomena but have no classical analog , or are based on novel theoretical ideas and principles .    in our discussion",
    "below , we shall divide the postulates into  ( i )  postulates that are adopted from classical physics , or are modified therefrom in light of experimental facts characteristic of quantum phenomena , ( ii )  postulates that are obtained through a classical - quantum correspondence argument , and  ( iii )  novel postulates with no classical counterparts .      a classical model of a physical system",
    "is based upon the _ partitioning _ , _ time _ and _ states _ background assumptions given earlier , and these are adopted unchanged in the abstract quantum model .",
    "the classical model additionally makes the following additional key assumptions :    1 .",
    "_ measurements . _",
    "* _ operational determinacy . _",
    "the outcome of a measurement performed on the system is determined by experimentally - controllable variables . *",
    "_ continuum .",
    "_ the values of the possible outcomes of a measurement form a real - valued continuum .",
    "_ * _ determinacy .",

    "if a map represents a continuous transformation  ( such as temporal evolution ) that depends continuously upon a set of real - valued parameters , then , for some value of these parameters , the map reduces to the identity .",
    "we remark that the measurements mentioned in  a12 are idealized , fundamental measurements , such as measurements of the position of a particle , which , in the framework of classical physics , are assumed to yield a continuum of possible outcomes  .",
    "similarly , although fundamental measurements of a physical quantity in a particular situation  ( such as the frequency of a bound membrane ) may take a discrete number of possible values , it is assumed that the discreteness arises through the particular boundary conditions that are applicable , rather than being an intrinsic feature of the measurements themselves .",
    "we also remark that , in  c0-c3 , it is assumed that physical transformations of a physical system are deterministic and reversible , which prevents the description of irreversible or indeterministic transformations within the classical framework at a fundamental level .",
    "first , we consider those postulates which adopt classical assumptions unchanged",
    ". postulates  3 and  3.1 correspond , respectively , to assumptions  c0 and  c1 , while postulate  3.3 is a combination of assumptions  c2 and  c3 .",
    "second , in light of the results of experiments involving quantum systems  ( such as stern - gerlach measurements on silver atoms ) , it is reasonable to modify assumptions  a1 ,  a2 and  b1 as follows :    * _ probabilistic operational determinacy . _",
    "the data obtained when a measurement is performed on the system are best modeled by a probabilistic source whose outcome probabilities are determined by experimentally - controllable variables . * _ finiteness .",
    "_ a measurement performed on a system has a finite number of possible outcomes . *",
    "_ probabilistic determinacy . _ the state of the system and a theoretical description of a measurement that is performed on the system only _ probabilistically _ determine the measurement outcome .",
    "we emphasize that , although these modifications are reasonable , they are not the only possibilities consistent with the experimental facts . for example , the probabilistic operational determinacy that one finds empirically can be accommodated in at least two ways .",
    "first , one can assume that the state of the system does , in fact , determine the outcome of a measurement performed upon the system , but that one can not , for some reason , control all of the relevant degrees of freedom of state .",
    "second , one can assume that the degrees of freedom of the state only determine the probability that a measurement yields a particular value .",
    "in this instance , we have taken the latter option .",
    "these modified assumptions are contained within postulates  1.1 and  2.1 .",
    "specifically , postulate  1.1 contains assumption  a1@xmath129 and  a2@xmath129 , while postulate  2.1 incorporates assumption  b1@xmath129 .",
    "a general guiding principle in building up a quantum model of a physical system is that , in an appropriate limit , the predictions of the quantum model of the system stand in some one - to - one correspondence with those of a classical model of the system . by establishing such a correspondence between the quantum and classical models of a particle",
    ", we shall transpose several elementary properties of the classical model across to the quantum model and then , by generalization , to the abstract quantum model ,  @xmath82 .",
    "consider an experiment in which a position measurement is used to prepare a particle at time  @xmath130 , and a position measurement is subsequently performed at time  @xmath131 , during which interval a potential  @xmath132 is assumed to act .",

    "for such an ensemble model , one can choose to describe an ensemble for the case of given total energy by means of a probability density function over phase space , and to describe the evolution of this function using newton s equations of motion .",

    "consider a system which admits abstract quantum model ,  @xmath532 , with respect to measurement set  @xmath31 , and which admits abstract quantum model ,  @xmath533 , with respect to measurement set  @xmath32 , where the set - ups defined by measurement sets  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 are disjoint  ( in the sense defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : f ] ) .",
    "the system can also be modeled as a whole .",
    "that is , we can construct the measurement set  @xmath534 , and construct abstract quantum model  @xmath82 , where  @xmath535 .",

    "one often prepares a state of a composite system by first preparing each of its subsystems , and then allowing these subsystems to interact with one another . in order to formally describe such a procedure",
    ", one needs a rule , the composite system rule , which we shall now derive , that enables the state of the system to be written down in terms of the states of its sub - systems .      in order to derive the composite system rule",
    ", we shall apply postulate  5 to the case of a composite system with two sub - systems with abstract models  @xmath532 and  @xmath533 , respectively , where the composite system has the abstract model  @xmath82 .",
    "suppose that the sub - systems are in states represented as  @xmath86 and  @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "then , by postulate  5 , the state of the composite system can be represented as  @xmath90 , where @xmath538 if we write the states of the sub - systems in complex form , @xmath539 and @xmath540 respectively , and , similarly , write the state of the composite system as @xmath541 then it follows from eqs .   and   that  @xmath96 can simply be written as  @xmath542 .",
    "more generally , consider a composite system with @xmath536  sub - systems , numbered  @xmath543 , in states  @xmath544 , respectively .",
    "we can regard sub - systems  @xmath174 and  @xmath175 as comprising a bipartite composite system , system  @xmath545 , which , according to the above result , is in state  @xmath542 .",
    "next , we can regard system  @xmath545 and sub - system  @xmath546 as comprising a bipartite composite system , system  @xmath193 , which is therefore in state  @xmath547 . continuing in this way",
    ", we can see the state of the composite system with @xmath536  sub - systems has the state  @xmath548 .",
    "suppose that measurement  @xmath549 , represented by @xmath83-dimensional hermitian operator  @xmath550 , with eigenstates  @xmath551 and eigenvalues  @xmath552 , respectively , is performed on sub - system  1 of a bipartite composite system .",
    "with respect to the abstract quantum model  @xmath82 of the composite system , measurement  @xmath553 is _ not _ in the measurement set  @xmath14 of the composite system since the measurement has only  @xmath83 distinct outcomes whereas a measurement in  @xmath14 has  @xmath554 possible outcomes .",
    "however , it is convenient to be able to describe measurement  @xmath553 , which we shall describe as a _ sub - system measurement _ , as an @xmath38-dimensional operator  @xmath95 , in the framework of  @xmath82 .    to determine the form of  @xmath95 , it is sufficient to consider the effect of  @xmath95 on product states of the form  @xmath555 of the composite system , where  @xmath556 .",
    "if the composite system is in such a state , then sub - system  1 is in state  @xmath551 .",
    "therefore , when measurement  @xmath553 is performed , outcome  @xmath552 is obtained with certainty , and the state of sub - system  1 is unchanged  ( up to an irrelevant overall phase ) .",
    "therefore , the state of the composite system remains unchanged .",
    "if we require that  @xmath95 has eigenvectors  @xmath557 , with respective eigenvalues  @xmath552 , it follows that  @xmath95 can be taken to be  @xmath558 , where  @xmath559 is the identity matrix in the model of sub - system  2 , with the only freedom being a physically irrelevant overall phase in each of the eigenstates of  @xmath550 .",
    "the above result trivially generalizes to the case of a measurement performed on one sub - system of a composite system consisting of @xmath536  sub - systems .",
    "the model  @xmath82 , whose explicit mathematical form has been derived above , applies to an abstract set - up where the measurements , chosen from the set  @xmath14 , have  @xmath38 possible outcomes and therefore , by the distinctness assumption of sec .",
    "[ sec : f - idealised - set - up ] , necessarily have  @xmath38 distinct outcome values . from the above discussions",
    ", it follows that each measurement  @xmath37 is represented by a non - degenerate hermitian operator of dimension  @xmath38 .",
    "now , it is useful to be able to describe measurements within the context of model  @xmath82 which have fewer than  @xmath38 outcomes .",
    "an example of such measurements that we have discussed above are sub - system measurements .",
    "we shall now broaden the discussion to allow for measurements with  @xmath560 possible outcomes where  @xmath561 is not a multiple of  @xmath38 and which therefore can not be regarded as sub - system measurements .",
    "consider an abstract set - up where a preparation implemented using a measurement from  @xmath14 is followed by measurement  @xmath19 , whose observable outcome probabilities are denoted  @xmath188 .",
    "suppose that , if measurement  @xmath562  ( with  @xmath560 ) possible outcomes ) replaces measurement  @xmath19 , the outcome probabilities ,  @xmath563 of measurement  @xmath562 can be determined from the  @xmath22 by a many - to - one map of the outcomes of  @xmath19 to the outcomes of  @xmath562 .",
    "for example , in the case where  @xmath564 and  @xmath565 , the map from the outcomes of  @xmath19 to the outcomes of  @xmath562 might consist in  @xmath566 , @xmath567 and  @xmath568 , in which case  @xmath569 and  @xmath570 .",
    "in such a case , we shall say that measurement  @xmath562 is a _ degenerate form _ of measurement  @xmath19 ; or , more simply , that measurement  @xmath562 is a degenerate measurement .",
    "now , measurement  @xmath562 can _ formally _ be treated as if it has  @xmath38 possible outcomes , but where some of these outcomes have the _ same _ value . in this mode of description , in the above example , one can maintain a one - to - one map between the outcomes of  @xmath19 and of  @xmath562  ( so that  @xmath571 , @xmath572 and so on ) , but label the outcomes of  @xmath562 with their outcome values , and , when computing the outcome probabilities of  @xmath562 , group together the outcomes with the same outcome value . in the above example , one would respectively label the three outcomes with outcome values  @xmath573 and  @xmath574 , and but have  @xmath575 .",
    "since measurement  @xmath562 is a degenerate form of measurement  @xmath19 , it can be represented by the @xmath38-dimensional degenerate hermitian operator  @xmath576 , where  @xmath577 .",
    "the outcome probabilities for measurement  @xmath562 can then be computed in the usual way , on the understanding that those outcomes with the same outcome values must not be regarded as physically distinguishable , but must be grouped as just described .",
    "conversely , in an abstract set - up where  @xmath14 contains measurements represented by all possible non - degenerate hermitian operators , a degenerate hermitian operator can be regarded as representing a measurement which is a degenerate form of some measurement in  @xmath14 .",
    "above , we have formulated a set of background assumptions  ( _ partitioning _ , _ time _ , and  _ states _ ) , an abstract experimental set up , and a set of postulates , from which we have shown that it is possible to derive the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism  ( apart from the explicit form of the temporal evolution operator , which will be derived in paper  ii ) .",
    "as described earlier , the background assumptions and the postulates have been formulated as far as possible so that they possess the properties of transparency and traceability .",
    "the background assumptions and a number of the postulates  ( postulates  3 ,  3.1 ,  3.3 ) are drawn unchanged from the framework of classical physics , and most of the remaining postulates are drawn from the framework of classical physics but modified in light of experimental facts  ( postulate  1.1 ) , or are based on a classical - quantum correspondence argument  ( postulates  2.1 ,  2.4 ,  3.2 ,  3.4 ,  5 ) .",
    "hence , the majority of the background assumptions and postulates can be traced to facts or principles that are , or can be , well grounded or reasonably well grounded in experimental facts or in our theoretical intuition .    of the remaining , novel postulates  ( postulates  1.2 ,  2.2 ,  2.3 ,  4 ) , postulate  1.2 is a direct generalization of experimental facts , and postulate  4 is a reasonable consistency principle .",
    "postulates  2.2 and  2.3 are both transparent in that they can be clearly understood as assertions about the physical world , and postulate  2.3 is traceable to a plausible theoretical principle . furthermore , since postulates  2.2 and  2.3 , in conjunction with the above - mentioned postulates , give rise to the abstract quantum formalism , there is good reason to believe that they are valid .",
    "nevertheless , these two postulates , particularly postulate  2.2 , are less well grounded in our theoretical intuition than the others , and since they play such a key role in the emergence of the quantum formalism , they shall be discussed further below .",
    "we mention briefly that it is also possible to understand some of the postulates using concepts that have not been mentioned thus far .",
    "for example , postulate  2.1 implies that , when a measurement is performed on a system , there are degrees of freedom in the state of a system about which no information is gained .",
    "hence , postulate  2.1 can be regarded as a concrete expression of bohr s principle of complementarity .",
    "consequently , it is possible for different measurements in the measurement set ,  @xmath578 , to be inequivalent in that they yield inequivalent information about the state of the system .",
    "if one accordingly regards measurements in  @xmath578 as providing distinct , inequivalent points of view of a physical system , then two questions arise which do not arise in classical physics , namely ( a )  how should one theoretically represent these different measurements , and ( b )  whether some measurements yield more information about the state of a system than other measurements . postulate  1.2 answers the first question by asserting that it is possible to represent all measurements in  @xmath578 in terms of any given measurement in  @xmath578 and appropriately chosen interactions in the interaction set ,  @xmath579 .",
    "postulate  2.3 answers the second question with the assertion that none of these points of view are privileged insofar as the _ amount _ of information they yield about the system , which can be regarded as a kind of principle of relativity applied to the perspectives provided by the different measurements in  @xmath14 .",
    "the derivation itself is noteworthy in several respects .",
    "first , it gives rise to a mathematical structure that is neither more nor less general than the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism .",
    "therefore , any change to the formalism would require a modification of the postulates or background assumptions .",
    "consequently , as we shall illustrate below , the derivation provides an excellent ` laboratory ' for investigating proposed modifications of the quantum formalism .",
    "second , the derivation yields the conclusion that physical transformations are represented either by unitary or antiunitary transformations .",
    "this is a rather remarkable , unanticipated feature of the derivation since antiunitary transformations are not generally regarded as an integral part of the abstract quantum formalism  ( as formalized , for instance , by dirac or von neumann ) , but are instead usually introduced by reference to the theorem of wigner  @xcite mentioned in the introduction .",
    "in addition , we note that antiunitary transformations have not been obtained in any of the recent attempts to derive the quantum formalism in which a significant fraction of the quantum formalism is obtained  @xcite . furthermore",
    ", since unitary and antiunitary transformations emerge simultaneously in the above derivation , the derivation suggests that antiunitary transformations are , in fact , an integral part of the quantum formalism .",
    "third , the derivation shows that the use of complex numbers in the quantum formalism is directly connected with the fact that the set of possible physical transformations can be represented by the set of all unitary or antiunitary transformations of a suitably defined complex vector space .",
    "specifically , the complex form of the quantum state and the ( anti)unitarity of physical transformations arise simultaneously as a result of imposing postulate  3.2 which , in turn , is based on the simple idea that a change in the overall value of the  @xmath147 in the hamilton - jacobi model has no physically observable consequences . hence , the derivation significantly elucidates the use of complex numbers in the quantum formalism .",
    "fourth , it is apparent from the derivation that the concept of information plays a substantial role in giving rise to the quantum formalism .",
    "the information gain condition directly leads to @xmath209-space , which introduces square - roots of probability , or _",
    "real _ amplitudes and , via postulate  2.3 , leads to a @xmath178-dimensional @xmath209-space .",
    "furthermore , in conjunction with postulate  2.4 , postulate  2.3 leads to the function  @xmath580 . hence , the sinusoidal functions into which the phases in a quantum state enter can be directly traced to the concept of information . finally , the prior over the unit hypersphere in @xmath211-space induced by the imposition of postulate  2.3 leads , via postulate  4 , to the strong constraint that physical transformations can only be represented by orthogonal transformations of the unit hypersphere .",
    "fifth , the formulation highlights the physical importance of the notion of a prior over a continuous parameter .",
    "the notion plays a key role in the derivation , entering through the definition of the shannon - jaynes entropy and through postulate  2.4 .",
    "this is noteworthy since the notion of prior appears to be underappreciated , occurring rather infrequently in discussions of the probabilistic aspects of quantum theory , and not occurring in most of the aforementioned deductive approaches to quantum theory  ( the approach due to caticha  @xcite being the only exception ) .",
    "sixth , from the perspective provided by the derivation , one can see rather clearly which assumptions quantum theory shares with classical physics , which assumptions are modifications of classical ideas in light of experimental facts , which assumptions are drawn from classical physics using a correspondence argument , and which are novel insofar as they have no classical counterparts . in particular",
    ", one can see that the new ideas that need to be introduced beyond those familiar from classical physics in order to obtain the quantum formalism all arise from the concepts of probability , information , or from classical - quantum correspondence arguments . since ideas concerning probability and correspondence played an important role in the historical development of quantum theory and in its interpretation in the years immediately following its formulation , the concept of information is the obvious new addition .",
    "postulate  2.2 introduces the assumption that , when a measurement is performed on a physical system , there are outcomes  ( which we have labeled  @xmath48 and  @xmath49 , and  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 ) that are objectively realized , but go unobserved by the experimenter",
    ".    the apparently successful derivation of the quantum formalism lends support to the plausibility of the assumption that a measurement generates unobserved outcomes .",
    "as mentioned above , the assumption also has the benefit of transparency .",
    "nevertheless , it raises two natural questions , namely  ( i ) to what physical property or properties should the outcomes  @xmath48 and  @xmath49 , and  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 be attributed ,  ( ii ) why are these outcomes not observed in standard experiments .",
    "a preliminary response to these questions is as follows .",
    "first , by examining the quantum model of a structureless particle in the classical limit  ( as @xmath139  tends to macroscopic values ) , we have seen that , for a system in an eigenstate of energy , the variable  @xmath47 in the quantum model corresponds to  @xmath147 in the discretized form of the classical hamilton - jacobi model .",
    "now , the  @xmath147 encode the local momenta and total energy of the system .",
    "hence , if a position measurement is performed and yields the observed outcome  @xmath23 , then we can associate the outcomes  @xmath581 and  @xmath582 with the local momenta and the total energy of the system",
    ".    more generally , if a measurement  @xmath19 is performed on a system , it seems reasonable to associate the outcomes  @xmath581 and  @xmath583 with the property  @xmath584 , which is complementary to property  @xmath585 , and with the total energy ,  @xmath76 , of the system .",
    "we shall say that property  @xmath584 is complementary to the property  @xmath585 measured by  @xmath19 in the sense that exact knowledge of the properties  @xmath585 and  @xmath584 suffice to determine the classical state of the system .",
    "second , the unobservability of the outcomes  @xmath581 and  @xmath582 may be roughly understood as follows .",
    "we shall see in paper  ii that , for a system in an eigenstate of energy  @xmath76 , the overall phase ,  @xmath586 , of its quantum state  ( in the complex representation ) changes at the rate  @xmath587 .",
    "a measurement which is able to resolve the outcomes  @xmath581 and  @xmath582 must therefore have a temporal resolution  @xmath588 .",
    "now , according to the energy - time uncertainty relation  @xmath589   as being a consequence of the classical result  @xmath590  ( relating the uncertainty in the duration and angular frequency of a wave ) and the photon energy - frequency relationship  @xmath591 .",
    "however , the validity and meaning of the energy - time uncertainty relation , and of the inferences that can legitimately drawn from it , have been , and continue to be , the subject of debate  ( see , for example  @xcite,  12.8 , and  @xcite ) . the argument given in the text leading to  @xmath592 should , accordingly , only be regarded as suggestive insofar as it relies on a particular interpretation of the energy - time uncertainty relation . ]",
    ", the energy associated with the interaction used to implement the measurement has uncertainty  @xmath593 , so that  @xmath592 . from  @xmath594",
    ", it then follows that  @xmath595 must be of the order of the rest energy of the system .",
    "a measurement of such energy would therefore probably not preserve the identity of the system , thereby violating the assumption that interactions preserve the identity of the system  ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : f - idealised - set - up ] ) .",
    "hence , a measurement with the requisite temporal resolution can not be consistently described within the quantum formalism .",
    "conversely , a measurement that , with high probability , preserves the identity of the system , will have insufficient temporal resolution to resolve the outcomes  @xmath581 and  @xmath582 .",
    "the information gain condition plays a key role in the above derivation via postulate  2.3 . in order to obtain a clearer understanding of the condition ,",
    "it is helpful to ask whether it resembles , or is equivalent to , other informational principles , or has other consequences which coincide with well - known results .",
    "below , we shall outline two of the consequences which are in agreement with results that are well - known in probability theory and statistics , and shall outline the connections to two other informational principles that have been proposed in the context of recent informational approaches to quantum theory .    first",
    ", we have shown elsewhere  @xcite that the assumption that the information gain condition applies to a probabilistic source is equivalent to jeffreys rule  @xcite , a general rule for the assignment of prior probabilities which was first suggested in the context of probability theory .",
    "this rule is widely used in some areas  ( in econometrics , for example ) , and yields priors for parameterized probability distributions  ( such as for the mean and standard deviation of a gaussian distribution ) that are in agreement with the results of other , independent lines of argument  ( see  @xcite , for example ) .",
    "we also note that the metric  @xmath596 , introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : d1-info - gain ] , provides a natural measure of the distance between probability distributions , and is equivalent , up to an irrelevant multiplicative constant , to the fisher metric ,  @xmath597 , which measures the distance between the probability distributions  @xmath25 and  @xmath598 .",
    "second , we note that the fisher metric was obtained in  @xcite as a natural measure of the distance between probability distributions , where it was connected with the hilbert space distance between pure states .",
    "the fisher metric also gives rise to the so - called fisher information of a continuous probability distribution , which is central to the fisher information approach to understanding quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that , if the information gain condition applies to a probabilistic source with some probability n - tuple ,  @xmath25 , it follows that , in  @xmath3 interrogations of the source , the amount of shannon - jaynes information provided by the data about  @xmath25 is an increasing function of  @xmath3 in the limit as  @xmath9 .",
    "this condition , which we shall call the _ condition of information increase _ , accords with the rather simple and intuitively plausible idea that , as one gathers more data from a probabilistic source , one s information about  @xmath25 strictly increases .",
    "this condition was first proposed , in a slightly different form , in  @xcite , where it forms the basis for an attempt to derive a part of the quantum formalism .",
    "hence , it appears that the information gain condition has a number of interesting and important connections to results in probability theory and to principles in various informational approaches to quantum theory .",
    "one of the major objectives of the programme of deriving quantum theory using the concept of information is to determine whether the concept of information is indispensable to our understanding of the quantum formalism , and , if so , to illuminate the precise relationship between the concept of information and the quantum formalism .    on the first issue , although many recent approaches to derive the quantum formalism involve the concept of information , the conclusion that information is indispensable to our understanding of the quantum formalism can not be drawn , either because the approaches are unable to obtain the quantum formalism  ( even though they are able to derive specific results , such as malus law ) , or because , in those approaches that are able to obtain a significant fraction of the quantum formalism , the abstract nature of some of the assumptions that are employed obscures the role played by information in determining the formalism .",
    "indeed , further doubt on the need for information is cast by other recent approaches , most notably due to hardy  @xcite , that are successful in deriving a significant fraction of the quantum formalism without invoking the concept of information in any way .    on the second issue",
    ", it is remarkable that the manner in which the concept of information is formalized differs considerably amongst the various informational approaches .",
    "consequently , as we shall elaborate upon below , the question of precisely _ how _",
    "one should formalize the concept of information in the quantum setting has received a wide range of often incompatible answers .",
    "however , it is difficult to evaluate the relative merits of these answers , for the same reasons just given above , namely either because the approaches are too incomplete or because they use abstract assumptions that obscure the role played by information .",
    "the formulation presented here provides significant new insight into both of these issues .",
    "first , the formulation rests on assumptions that are transparent and that are , to a large extent , traceable to familiar or well - established experimental facts or theoretical ideas .",
    "for example , abstract assumptions that directly introduce complex numbers are avoided . as a result ,",
    "the role played by information in the derivation can be clearly seen , and its role is sufficiently widespread that it seems very likely that the concept of information could indeed have a fundamental role to play in our understanding of the origin of the quantum formalism .    in order to discuss the second issue ,",
    "it is convenient to classify the above - mentioned differences in the formalization of the concept of information with respect to ( a )  what the information is about , ( b )  whether or not information is quantified in some way , ( c )  which information measure is chosen , and ( d )  when the shannon - jaynes measure is used , whether there is a naturally preferred prior , and , if so , what is the form of the prior .    in particular , with respect to  ( a ) , in  @xcite ,",
    "information gain is , as in our approach , regarded as the gain of information about the state of the system due to the receipt of data obtained through performing a measurement on the system .",
    "in contrast , in  @xcite , information gain is taken to be the removal of the uncertainty of the experimenter about the outcome of a measurement as a result of the measurement being performed . in respect to  (",
    "b ) , one finds that , for example , in  @xcite , information is not subject to quantification , whereas in  @xcite , a particular quantification measure is employed .    with respect to  ( c ) ,",
    "the shannon - jaynes entropy is used in  @xcite , whereas  @xcite employs a measure that differs from the shannon entropy , it being argued that the shannon entropy is inapplicable in the quantum setting  @xcite .",
    "finally , with respect to  ( d ) , some authors  @xcite appear to hold the view that there is no natural basis for determining a prior for the shannon - jaynes entropy , while , in the field of probability theory , authors who have sought plausible general principles for the assignment of priors have obtained different priors over probability n - tuples  ( for example , see  @xcite ) on the basis of their arguments .",
    "the approach described here supports the view that information is primarily to be regarded as information gained about the state of a system by an experimenter as a result of performing measurements on the system .",
    "in addition , the approach demonstrates the importance of information quantification , and provides significant support for the view that the shannon - jaynes entropy is the appropriate information measure in a quantum setting .",
    "finally , we have shown that , for an experimenter who receives a system prepared in a pure but unknown state , it is possible to formalism an intuitively plausible principle  ( postulate  2.3 ) which determines the prior for the probabilistic source that models a measurement performed on the system by the experimenter .",
    "as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : f - idealised - set - up ] , one can see that the experimenter s state of knowledge in this case is not arbitrarily chosen , but precisely reflects the knowledge that a system has been prepared in such a way that its pre - preparation history is irrelevant insofar as the outcomes of subsequent measurements in the set - up are concerned  ( a preparation which is analogous to an idealized complete preparation in classical physics ) and therefore has fundamental physical significance .",
    "the deductive formulation has several implications for some issues of concern in the interpretation of quantum theory , and for some of the proposed modifications of quantum theory .",
    "we shall briefly outline one example .",
    "[ [ modification - of - the - quantum - formalism . ] ] modification of the quantum formalism .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    since the development of the quantum formalism , there has been some uncertainty as to whether the formalism is the most general formalism for the description of quantum phenomena .",
    "various possibilities have been suggested for the generalization of the formalism which , from a purely mathematical point of view , seem to be plausible , and which may have interesting physical consequences .",
    "for example , the possibility of non - unitary temporal evolution has been considered by several authors  @xcite .    in some cases",
    ", it is possible to devise experimental tests to rule out certain types of modification on physical grounds .",
    "however , it is not always possible to devise such tests or to implement them .",
    "the deductive formulation described here provides another way in which the physical plausibility of a proposed modification may be assessed .",
    "the deductive formulation shows that a set of postulates implies the existing quantum formalism .",
    "hence , if any proposed modification of the formalism is to be valid , one or more of these postulates must be changed in some way . by tracing the dependency of the features of the quantum formalism that are at issue to specific postulates , and assessing the consequences of modifying one or more of these postulates , one can potentially use the deductive formulation to obtain another indication as to whether a proposed modification is physically plausible .",
    "furthermore , the formulation has the potential to allow one to explicitly work out the effect that specific changes to particular postulates would have upon the quantum formalism .    for example",
    ", for the purpose of illustrating how the deductive formulation can help guide modifications to quantum formalism , suppose that one wishes to modify the quantum formalism so as to allow continuous transformations to be represented by non - unitary transformations .",
    "now , in the deductive formulation , unitarity depends most directly upon postulate  3.2  ( _ invariance _ ) , and additionally depends upon several supporting postulates which are based on classical physics , on probabilistic ideas , or on novel assumptions .",
    "the proposed modification implies that one or more of these postulates needs to be modified .    amongst the supporting postulates , all but postulate  2.2 have a reasonably high degree of certainty .",
    "however , it does not appear to be possible to modify postulate  2.2 in any plausible manner so as to give rise to non - unitary transformations .",
    "the most likely candidate for modification therefore appears to be postulates  3.2 .",
    "consider the extreme case where the constraint imposed by postulate  3.2 is entirely removed .",
    "then , the set of possible transformations consists of the set of orthogonal transformations of the unit hypersphere in  @xmath211 .",
    "when expressed in complex form , this set of transformations contains transformations that are neither unitary nor antiunitary .",
    "thus , a simple modification of the postulates readily yields a set of non - unitary transformations which can then be subjected to further examination to assess their physical significance and plausibility .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that majority of the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism can be derived from a set of physically comprehensible assumptions .",
    "the derivation illuminates the physical origin of the quantum formalism and the role played by information in quantum theory , makes clearer the commonalities and differences in the assumptions underlying quantum physics and classical physics , and potentially has significant implications for the interpretation and proposed modifications of quantum theory .",
