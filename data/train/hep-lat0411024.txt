    "in the past years , there has been a tremendous amount of progress in the analytical understanding of supersymmetric theories due to the discovery of ads / cft correspondence @xcite , using ",
    "orbifolding \" @xcite ,  orientifolding \" @xcite , or others .",
    "recently armoni , shifman and veneziano have shown that in the large @xmath1 limit a non - supersymmetric gauge theory with a dirac fermion in the antisymmetric tensor representation is equivalent , both perturbatively and nonperturbatively , to @xmath0=1 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory in its bosonic sector @xcite . since for @xmath4",
    "the non - supersymmetric gauge theory is just one - flavor qcd , even though we have to keep in mind @xmath5 corrections , knowing the nonperturbative properties of @xmath0=1 sym is of great importance from phenomenological viewpoint as well .",
    "accordingly , one can not stress enough the importance of being able to perform some nonperturbative numerical calculations for @xmath6=1 sym to test the predictions made by armoni , shifman and veneziano .",
    "however , this is not an easy task by any means .",
    "this is because the supersymmetry ( susy ) transformation , which is an extension of the poincar transformation , is broken on a lattice due to the lack of continuous spatial translational symmetry and because leibniz rule does not hold on a lattice .",
    "therefore , new attempts to put sym on the lattice are interesting and eagerly awaited .",
    "there have been some promising approaches along this direction @xcite that partially preserve susy .",
    "however , there still appear to be some remaining issues before the method introduced by cohen , kaplan , katz and unsal becomes a practical computational approach @xcite .",
    "the approach by sugino @xcite has encountered unwanted surplus modes in four dimensions ( in euclidean space ) @xcite and is still waiting numerical simulations=2 sym on the two dimensional lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "for other recent progress in an effort to realize susy on a lattice , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently the authors proposed another method to put sym on a lattice @xcite .",
    "this approach is in fact not a new idea , rather it is motivated by the idea of the  ( de)construction \" @xcite and is a mixture of the two existing ideas ; the transverse lattice @xcite and supersymmetric discrete light cone quantization ( sdlcq ) @xcite .",
    "our first attempt was made for 2 + 1 dimensional @xmath7 sym with one transverse lattice .",
    "here we present a formulation for 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath0=1 sym with a two dimensional transverse lattice in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "at each site of the two dimensional lattice , we have one gauge boson and one four - component majorana spinor .",
    "adjacent sites are connected by the link variables .",
    "all these fields depend only on the light - cone time and spatial coordinates @xmath8 and are associated with two site indices , say @xmath9 . in the large @xmath1 limit , however , it turns out that we are allowed to drop the site indices for our calculation .",
    "this is in some sense the manifestation of the eguchi - kawai reduction @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the naive eguchi - kawai reduction encounters a problem due to the violation of one of the assumptions made by eguchi and kawai @xcite .",
    "that assumption is the @xmath10 symmetry . since we do not have to assume the @xmath10 symmetry to justify our reduction of the transverse lattice degrees of freedom , we believe that we do not have to introduce quenching @xcite or twisted @xcite lattices , which were invented to overcome the problem associated with the naive eguchi - kawai reduction at weak couplings . for more complete and detailed discussion for this claim , see appendix [ reduction ] . with this reduction of the transverse degrees of freedom",
    ", we can regard all the fields as 1 + 1 dimensional objects .",
    "that is to say that we have some complicated 1 + 1 dimensional field theory with some highly non - trivial interactions of the fields .",
    "furthermore , since we can always work in the frame where we have zero transverse momenta @xmath11 , @xmath0=1 susy algebra in 3 + 1 dimensions becomes identical to @xmath0=2 susy algebra in 1 + 1 dimensions , which is sometimes referred to as @xmath0=(2,2 ) susy in literature , ( 2,2 ) for two @xmath12 s and two @xmath13 s .",
    "we are able to maintain one of this underlying @xmath14=(2,2 ) susy algebra in our formulation , meaning that we are able to preserve one exact susy .",
    "we discretize light - cone momentum @xmath15 by imposing the periodic condition on the light - cone spatial coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we have two spatial lattices and one momentum lattice in our model .",
    "since we are dealing with spatial lattices , one has to be concerned about the notorious fermion doubling problem .",
    "in fact it is well known that the transverse lattice suffers from the doubling problem @xcite .",
    "however , the authors have found that sdlcq formulation of a transverse lattice model is automatically free of the doubling problem @xcite .",
    "there are some aspects of this calculation that are similar to the 2 + 1 dimensional model @xcite and there are others that are not .",
    "what is not the same is that the supercharge @xmath17 has terms which have different powers of the coupling @xmath18 , where @xmath19 . to be more precise",
    ", @xmath17 consists of terms proportional to @xmath20 and terms proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "the different powers of @xmath20 give rise to a rich spectrum as one varies @xmath20 , and the wavefunctions depend on @xmath20 .",
    "this means that it is possible to see wavefunctions which are almost vanishing at small couplings , but become very large at strong couplings , and vice versa .",
    "one more thing which is different from the previous case is that our @xmath17 has terms of third and fifth order in dynamical fields , while all of the terms in @xmath13 are of third order for 2 + 1 dimensional case .",
    "this leads to a hamiltonian of eighth order in fields , which is of higher order than the hamiltonian of sixth order that we get from the standard formulation of 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath0=1 sym on the two transverse lattice .",
    "we admit that this is a disadvantage of our formulation in 3 + 1 dimensions compared to that in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , we still think that our approach is more advantageous since in the sdlcq formulation we use @xmath17 , not the hamiltonian , and this @xmath17 is still of lower order in fields than the hamiltonian obtained from the standard formulation , and since the standard formulation suffers from the fermion doubling problem .",
    "similar to the 2 + 1 dimensional case we are not able to preserve the full supersymmetry algebra .",
    "we are able to maintain one exact susy .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that when quantizing the dynamical fields we have to make the link variable , which is a unitary matrix , a linear complex matrix .",
    "one way to compensate for the effects of this  linearization \" is to make use of the  color - dielectric \" formulation of the lattice gauge theory @xcite . in this formulation",
    "we consider smeared degrees of freedom @xmath22 , which are obtained from the original link variable @xmath23 by averaging @xmath23 over some finite volume , say @xmath24 . in order for this smeared theory to be equivalent to the original one , we must have an effective potential for the @xmath22 defined by integrating out @xmath23 @xcite @xmath25=\\int { \\cal d}m\\delta({\\cal m}-\\sum_{av}m)\\exp[-s_{canonical}(m)].\\]]however , this @xmath26 can be very complicated and performing the path integral above is extremely difficult , if not impossible .",
    "thus , one makes some approximations with ansatz to determine @xmath27 . for more detail",
    ", we d refer the reader to the refs .",
    "@xcite .    to constrain the linearized fields ,",
    "we require the model to exactly conserve one susy as we did for our 2 + 1 dimensional calculation .",
    "that is , we present a physical @xmath17 that preserves one susy . by",
    " physical \" we mean a @xmath17 which transforms one physical state into another physical state .",
    "we are not able to fully recover susy due to the absence of a physical @xmath28 .",
    "this defect results in a different number of massless states in the bosonic and fermionic sectors .",
    "however , we do see the mass degeneracy among the massive bosonic and fermionic states .",
    "the linearization doubles the bosonic degrees of freedom , leading to the susy breakdown .",
    "the partial recovery of susy implies that we have cured some but not all of the problems associated with the linearization .",
    "we are numerically able to identify what we call the cyclic states and non - cyclic states by examining the properties of the states .",
    "the cyclic states are those whose color flux winds all the way around in one or two of the transverse directions . for the non - cyclic",
    "states the color flux is localized in color space .",
    "the cyclic bound states have a non - trivial spectrum as a function of the winding number .",
    "we find that @xmath3 for the cyclic bound states can be fit by either @xmath29 or @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are some constants and @xmath32 is the winding number in the @xmath33-direction with @xmath34 .",
    "it could be interesting to know how the form of the @xmath3 changes from weak coupling to strong coupling however the complicated spectrum for strong couplings puts this beyond our reach at the present time .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in sec .  2 we present a standard formulation of @xmath0=1 sym with a two dimensional transverse lattice and derive constraint equations on the physical states .",
    "we discuss the implications of those in some detail .",

    "show that this formulation is free from the doubling problem .",
    "the coupling dependence of the mass spectrum is discussed in sec .  4 followed by numerical results for cyclic bound states in sec .  5 and for non - cyclic bound states in sec .",
    "the summary and possible further directions of investigation are given in sec .",

    "let us point out the fact that this naive lagrangian formulation is _ not free from the fermion species doubling problem _ , while our sdlcq formulation that we will introduce in the next section actually _ is _",
    "nonetheless , the constraint equation would still be valid since the constraint equation ( [ equations ] , [ constraint ] ) was derived from @xmath127 in which we do not have any problematic terms responsible for the doubling problem , i.e. the terms which contains the difference between fermions at different sites .",
    "therefore , we assume that this physical constraint is valid for our sdlcq formulation in the next section and we will fully utilize it when we carry out our numerical calculations .    with this subtlety in mind , let us complete this section by discussing the physical constraint in more detail .",
    "the states are all constructed in the large@xmath1 limit , and therefore we need only consider single  trace states . in order for a state to be color singlet at each site , _ each color index has to be contracted at the same site_. as an example consider a state represented by @xmath128 , where we ve suppressed the momentum carried by @xmath124 and @xmath125 and we ll do so hereafter unless it s necessary for clarity . for this state",

    "the color @xmath106 is contracted at site @xmath52 _ only _ and the color @xmath107 at site @xmath130 _ only_. therefore , this is a physical state satisfying eq . .",
    "a picture to visualize this case is shown in fig .",
    "diagrammatically , one can say that at every point in color space one has to have either no lines or two lines , one of which goes into and the other of which comes out of the point , so that the color indices are contracted at the same site .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     recall that we found in sec .  4 that a bound state would be a linear combination of states of the four types we enumerated in sec .  4 . hence",
    ", it is instructive to see if we can identify the three bound states with any of the four types .",
    "for @xmath132 we can identify all the three bound states with those that are killed by @xmath133 and whose mass in units of @xmath134 are independent of @xmath20 .",
    "however , as @xmath135 increases , we are not able to classify them into any particular type of the four .",
    "this is because as we increase @xmath135 the number of states becomes very large and the mass spectrum becomes dense .",
    "it is likely that these states mix with other nearby states with the same coupling dependence , giving rise to small changes in @xmath3 but still the same general coupling dependence . at this time",
    "however we are not able to resolve the spectrum in an enough detail to study these effects .",
    "we have presented the standard formulation of @xmath0=1 sym in 3 + 1 dimensions with a two spatial dimensional transverse lattice .",
    "then we gave the sdlcq formulation of the theory .",
    "we found that the standard formulation suffers from a fermion species doubling problem , while sdlcq formulation does not . in the frame where the transverse momenta equal to zero , @xmath0=1 susy in 3 + 1 dimensions is equivalent to @xmath0=2 susy in 1 + 1 dimensions",
    "also known as @xmath0=(2,2 ) susy .",
    "we were able to present @xmath17 which has the correct continuum form and yields by the susy algebra a discrete form of @xmath99 , where @xmath19 .",
    "this @xmath99 then coincides with its continuum form in the continuum limit .",
    "since @xmath136 and @xmath137 do nt commute with each other in our formulation , we are to use only one of them to solve the mass eigenvalue problem , preserving one exact susy .    we found that this @xmath17 consists of terms which are proportional to @xmath138 and terms which go like @xmath21 .",
    "this led us to investigate in some detail the @xmath20 dependence of the mass spectrum . from a simple toy model we concluded that the rich , complicated behavior of the mass spectrum with varying @xmath20 is due to some non - trivial coupling dependence of the wavefunctions .",
    "this is also responsible for a  transition \" in the structure of a bound state when going from weak coupling to strong coupling . because the dominant structure of a bound state changes with changing @xmath20 .",
    "we classified the bound states into two types , the cyclic and non - cyclic as we did in ref .",
    "the cyclic bound states are those whose color flux goes all the way around in one or two of the transverse directions .",
    "the bound states whose color flux is localized and does not wind around are referred to as the non - cyclic bound states . for each type of the bound states",
    ", we were able to identify some bound states in the mass spectrum for @xmath139 and found the @xmath140 limit of @xmath3 .",
    "for the cyclic bound states we were able to present @xmath3 as a function of the winding number @xmath32 in the @xmath33 direction with @xmath34 .",
    "we found two very good fits to the data .",
    "the first fit @xmath30 is motivated by the string theory , where the energy has the form @xmath141 , where @xmath142 are some integers , @xmath143 is the string tension and @xmath144 is the period of the transverse lattice .",
    "the other fit @xmath29 is motivated by the operator structure of @xmath17 .",
    "it appeared that @xmath30 is preferable ,    for the non - cyclic states as @xmath145 we saw good linear conversion of @xmath3 of the low - energy bound states that we could identify and gave the extrapolated values for @xmath3 .",
    "we could identify for @xmath132 the bound states with a state whose @xmath3 in units of @xmath134 are independent of @xmath20 though we were not able to do so for higher @xmath135 s because of the dense , and complicated spectrum .    in summary",
    ", we were able to present a formulation of sym in 3 + 1 dimensions with one exact susy on a two dimensional transverse lattice and find the mass spectrum nonperturbatively .",
    "there remain however a number of important questions to answer .",
    "first and foremost it is of great importance to determine the form of @xmath3 numerically to better precision .",
    "it is interesting to see what the winding number dependence of @xmath3 is if both of the winding numbers are non - zero .",
    "we need to invent a method to resolve the dense spectrum at strong couplings .",
    "this will help us see if there is any  transition \" in the form of @xmath3 as one goes from weak coupling to strong coupling .",
    "however , perhaps most importantly , as discussed in appendix [ reduction ] we need to know to what extent we ve resolved the problem caused by the linearization of the link variables that we needed to quantize the fields . knowing this tells us how reliable our numerical results are . because one of our major simplifications in numerical calculation in the large @xmath1 limit comes about from the reduction of the transverse degrees of freedom whose justification relies upon the presence of the quantized fields and the vacuum .",
    "restoration of susy for massive bound states , which has been broken by the linearlization gives us some confidence that our formulation indeed provides some sensible results .",
    "however , we would still have to clarify the issue to be more certain and confident .",
    "to this end , we need to compare our numerical results with some well - established theoretical predictions and with other numerical results obtained from the usual lattice calculation .",
    "hence , it is of importance to apply our formulation to some other supersymmetric theories in higher than 1 + 1 dimensions , for instance , wess - zumino model , lattice sigma model , and sqed .",
    "it appears that the application is relatively straightforward . from more practical point of view ,",
    "a next question to ask is what happens if one includes scalars and their superpartners in theory .",
    "we did not consider this case in this paper simply because this was the first attempt to formulate sym in 3 + 1 dimensions with one exact susy on a two dimensional transverse lattice and , thus , we wanted to consider the simplest possible case .",
    "however , it is of great interest to consider the question in the future .",
    "the authors believe that when we are able to answer all those questions , we will also be able to test the predictions made by armoni , shifman and veneziano @xcite .",
    "this work was supported in part by the u.s .",
    "department of energy .",
    "for our numerical calculation we ve set @xmath146 , in other words , we ve dropped the site indices .",
    "this reduction of the transverse degrees of freedom has brought a great amount of simplification in our calculation and needs some detailed justification . since it is only the supercharges that we need to do our calculation , if the supercharges do not depend on the site indices in the large @xmath1 limit , neither does any quantity that can be computed from @xmath17 , for instance @xmath3 for our case .",
    "therefore , in order to justify the reduction of the degrees of freedom for our purposes , it suffices to show the independence of @xmath17 of the site indices in the large @xmath1 limit . in this appendix , in particular , we will show that in the large @xmath1 limit the leading order terms of the supercharges @xmath17 with keeping all the site indices are the same as those with setting @xmath146 .",
    "we should note that this sort of arguments about the justification of the reduction on a transverse lattice have already been given in literature , for instance see refs .",
    "@xcite and our arguments below closely parallel those in the refs .  @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we only consider @xmath136 , however the same arguments apply equally well to @xmath137 . for definiteness",

    "we get by setting @xmath146 is down by @xmath5 compared to the leading order term eq .",
    "and thus we can ignore it in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "of course , in the above example , we could and would have gotten many more terms depending on what we have in those dots inside the trace of the fock state we considered .",
    "however , it is easy to see that our conclusion remains the same ; all the extra terms we get by having only one site are down by @xmath5 or more powers of @xmath5 .",
    "this all comes down to the fact that we can have only single - traced states in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "therefore , we find that the leading order terms of @xmath17 are the same whether we keep track of the site indices or not .",
    "although this proof is for finite @xmath135 , we suspect that the same result would persist at infinite @xmath135 .    the way to justify the reduction here",
    "should be contrasted to the way exploited by eguchi and kawai @xcite .",
    "eguchi and kawai showed that in the large @xmath1 limit we can work with only one lattice site in each of the space - time directions in euclidean space .",
    "however , the proof was based on , among others , the assumption that @xmath10 symmetry is not spontaneously broken , where @xmath119 is the number of the space - time dimensions .",
    "this assumption was found to be wrong for @xmath157 at weak couplings by the authors of ref.@xcite . to resolve this problem ,",
    "there have been many models proposed , for instance quenching @xcite and twisted @xcite lattice formulations . here in our formulation , however , we believe that we do not have to introduce any of the modified lattice formulation since the way we justify the reduction is quite different the way eguchi and kawai do .",
    "our proof stands on its own feet regardless of us maintaining the @xmath10 symmetry or not and , therefore , would not suffer from the problem associated with the naive eguchi - kawai reduction as we go from weak to strong couplings .",
    "a question , however , remains .",
    "that is the question of how well we ve managed to quantize the fields since all our arguments above rely on the fact that we have the quantized fields and true vacuum .",
    "put in another way , how good the reduction procedure is depends on how good our quantization procedure is .",
    "recall that to quantize , we had to `` linearize '' the unitary link variables , which leads to the breakdown of susy .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite make use of the `` color - dielectric '' formulation to resolve the problem for non - supersymmetric theories .",
    "although this formulation resolves the problem completely , it prevents one from going to small lattice spacings . in our formulation",
    "we do not have that constraint on the lattice spacing .",
    "however , the price we pay is that we resolve the problem of the linearization partially , not completely .",
    "thus , it is of great importance for one to see to what extent we ve resolved the problem and , if possible and necessary , to find a way to get around it completely . up to this point",
    "we are not able to answer this question , but this is one of the crucial steps we should take towards a more sensible supersymmetric model on a lattice within our formulation .",
    "in this appendix we give the super - algebra in majorana representation in @xmath35 dimensional light - cone coordinates where @xmath36 .",
    "in majorana representation majorana spinors have real component fields , and can be written as @xmath158 where @xmath159 , @xmath160 are left - moving , right - moving spinors with real components .",
    "this implies that the supercharge @xmath161 is also a majorana spinor with real components of the form @xmath162 where the integration is taken over the @xmath163 spatial dimensions , @xmath164 is the supercurrent , which is a majorana spinor .                in 3 + 1 dimensions majorana spinors",
    "have four components and thus the supercharge can be written as @xmath177 gamma matrices are @xmath178 matrices given by @xmath78 @xmath79 then eq .   yields @xmath179 hence , we find @xmath180 @xmath181 where @xmath182 .",
    "note that if @xmath183 , then this algebra coincides with the one for @xmath0=2 susy in 1 + 1 dimensions also known as @xmath0=(2,2 ) susy .",
