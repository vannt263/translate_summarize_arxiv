    "one of the principal goals of globular cluster photometric studies carried out during the past century was to determine period changes of rr lyrae stars .",
    "the hope to reveal evolutionary changes motivated many extensive works .",
    "( for details see e.g. @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "however , attempts to connect the observed period changes directly with the different phases of horizontal branch ( hb ) evolution have not led to indisputable conclusions .",
    "neither the large period decreases nor the random and/or abrupt period changes that have been detected in many clusters can be explained on the basis of steady evolutionary effects .",
    "the basic tool in the determination of period changes of variable stars is the @xmath1 diagram .",
    "this plots the difference between the observed times ( @xmath2 ) of a particular phase ( e.g. maximum ) of the light - curve and the predicted times of the same phase ( @xmath3 ) calculated according to an accepted ephemeris .",
    "a nonlinear @xmath1 indicates period changes while a linear @xmath1 with a non - zero slope points to inaccuracy of the adopted period .",
    "@xcite showed that period - noise can have a cumulative effect in the @xmath1 of variable stars , thus mimicking true period changes .",
    "however , in case of rr lyrae stars @xcite concluded that their @xmath1 diagrams can not be wholly explained as the result of period - noise .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite showed that the mean period change rates observed in globular clusters were consistent with synthetic hb models if the hb types of the clusters were also considered .",
    "however , accurate determinations of period changes are available for only a small sample of clusters and for many of these , the derived period change rates vary from one study to another ( see e.  g. the @xmath4 d / myr difference in the mean period change rate for ngc  7006 given by @xcite and @xcite ) . thus it is still an important task to define accurate period change rates in globular clusters by using not only the most recent data , but also any earlier observations , even if they can only be reconstructed from published light curves or epochs of maximum light . searching for unpublished cluster observations and making them accessible for future studies is very worthwhile .",
    "the preference for period increases in @xmath0  centauri was first noticed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite strengthened this result and raised the possibility of an evolutionary explanation .",
    "the recent ccd observations of the variables @xcite within the framework of the ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment ) project have lengthened the time - base of the observations to more than one hundred years , thus making it possible to extend the earlier period change studies .",
    "we used all known and available photometric information on @xmath0  centauri variables including the original photographic data of @xcite and the recent ccd v observations of @xcite .",
    "in addition , the scarce photoelectric v observations made by @xcite and @xcite of v92 proved to be useful in some cases for defining an @xmath1 value at an epoch when no other observations were obtained .",
    "@xcite published @xmath1 values for 47 rrab stars based partly on observations obtained with the yale - columbia 26-inch refractor in 1947 , 1948 , 1956 , 1958 , 1961 , 1962 and 1963 .",
    "the individual magnitudes were not included in her paper .",
    "however , we have obtained most of the unpublished data for these 47 rrab stars and for a further 41 variables , mainly rrc stars .",
    "in addition , magnitudes derived from observations made with the same telescope in 1965 and 1967 have been obtained . in table",
    "[ belserene ] , a sample of the magnitudes for the first 11 stars are listed ; the rest are available in the electronic edition",
    ". observations of some variables not included in the present study are also given in table  [ belserene ] ( sx phe : v65 , red variable : v164 , and variables with not enough data to investigate period changes : v167 and v169 ) .",
    "we used @xmath1 values that @xcite derived from the @xmath5 observations @xcite and for the yale - columbia 1961 and 1962 observing seasons because these original data could not be located .",
    "@xcite examined the period changes of bl  her type stars in globular clusters . to give the most complete sample of the period changes",
    ", we have also included the @xmath0  centauri stars they studied in our present work , even though new data have not been obtained for all of the variables .",
    "about 400 photographic b plates were taken by c. clement with the university of toronto s 61 cm ( f/15 ) helen sawyer hogg telescope at the las campanas observatory of the carnegie institution of washington from 1972 to 1986 .",
    "the plates were measured on a cuffey iris astrophotometer .",
    "as these observations span more than a decade , they have crucial importance for following the period changes in the second half of the century . in table",
    "[ lacampanas ] , part of these data for the first 14 variables are given .",
    "the entire data set is presented in the electronic edition .",
    "photographic b and v observations obtained by e. h. geyer with the 80/90/300 cm adh baker schmidt camera of the boyden observatory in the 1962 observational season @xcite were also used .",
    "the photometric data of these observations have not been published , but recovery of the original measurements is possible for 18 variables out of which 16 are used in this work .",
    "the other two stars are v65 ( sx phe ) , and v167 .",
    "table  [ adh ] lists these photographic b data . for most of the observed stars only folded light - curves are available .",
    "these folded curves could be used to determine phase relation only if the assumed period and initial epoch were known without doubt .    in table",
    "[ data - all ] the different observations of the @xmath0  centauri variables are summarized .",
    "the new variables discovered by @xcite are not included in table  [ data - all ] because there is no previous record for determining the period variation .",
    "rr lyraes with not enough data to construct any reliable segment of their @xmath1 are also omitted ( v80,110,114,135,136,137,141,143,145,146,147,153,154 , 156,157,158,158,169 and all the variables after v170 ) .",
    "we used the original photometric data to determine phase shifts whenever they were available .",
    "( these sources are denoted by x in table  [ data - all ] . )",
    "the ccd v @xcite observations were used to define the normal curves and the phase shifts for the other epochs were measured relative to these curves .",
    "both vertical and horizontal shifts were derived for all the other photometric data in order to match the normal curve best .",
    "the most deviant magnitudes were omitted from each dataset .",
    "we applied a single vertical ( zero - point ) shift to the different observations , with the exception of the ogle measurements .",
    "when the same star appeared in different ogle fields , these data were treated separately and differences in their zero points were also determined .    for determining @xmath1 values ( horizontal shifts )",
    "the datasets were divided into shorter segments ( @xmath6 years long ) .",
    "( for simplicity , we denote @xmath1 as the phase shift between the light - curves as a whole instead of the traditional definition of reading phase shifts only between special parts of the light - curves . )",
    "if there were no ogle observations of the star , the phase shifts were measured relative to martin s ( 1938 ) photographic @xmath7 curves .    as phase shifts between photographic b , v ,",
    "photoelectric and ccd v observations were measured , it was also important to check the effect of data inhomogenity on the results . by determining the optimal horizontal and vertical shifts between the b and v light - curves of the recent ccd b and v observations of the m2 variables @xcite , a mean phase shift of 0.0021 d ( with 0.0039 rms ) between the v and b light - curves of the 19 rrab stars was found .",
    "the shift for the 12 rrc stars is 0.0001 d ( 0.0021 rms ) .",
    "consequently , although the times of maxima systematically deviate in b and v , when the phase shifts of the whole light - curves are considered then no significant difference according to the colors occur .",
    "the @xmath1 ambiguity arising from data inhomogeneity is therefore less than @xmath8 of the period .",
    "@xmath1 values were derived from the data compiled in table  [ data - all ] at all of the epochs for which it was possible to obtain a reliable value .",
    "observations of @xcite and @xcite were divided into two parts , while the las campanas observations allowed for the determination of six independent @xmath1 points in most cases .",
    "observations from the different ogle fields were used independently .",
    "if the observations of one of the ogle fields were extensive enough , @xmath1 -s were determined for two of its segments .",
    "the @xmath1 values given by @xcite for @xmath5 , 1961 and 1962 ( jd  2423530 , 2437454 and 2437727 , respectively ) were appropriately transformed if the @xmath1 curve was constructed with a period different from the one she used .",
    "similar transformations were applied for the adh schmidt data in cases where only the folded light - curves were available .",
    "we constructed the @xmath1 curve by using an estimated value of the average period over the century ( @xmath9 ) in order to obtain a symmetrical form and fitted the @xmath1 points by different order polynomials .",
    "the @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the epoch number , and @xmath9 is the period used to determine @xmath1 .",
    "if we approximate the @xmath1 with a polynomial in the form of @xmath12 then the temporal period can be determined using the @xmath13 coefficients : @xmath14 if it is possible to determine the period with sufficient accuracy at the date of the observations , we also have a direct measure of the period changes for comparing with the above fit .",
    "furthermore , if we transform the time according to @xmath15 then all the data can be folded with a single period because , from eq .",
    "2 , it follows that the @xmath1 term vanishes .",
    "thus we have two methods for checking the validity of both the @xmath1 values and their trial polynomial fits , namely ( a ) a comparison of the direct period determinations with the temporal periods predicted according to the derivative of the @xmath1 and ( b ) the scatter of the folded curve of the time transformed data .",
    "this is essential when an ambiguity in the cycle number counts occurs .    figs .",
    "1a - l , 2a - h and 3 show the results for rrab , rrc and rr lyrae - like stars ( which were formerly called bl  her type variables ) , respectively . in the left panels which show the @xmath1 data and their polynomial fits ,",
    "the filled circles denote @xmath1 points derived from the phase shifts of the original data while open circles are for belserenes s ( 1964 ) @xmath1 values for @xmath5 , 1961 and 1962 and for phase shifts which were read from geyer s folded light - curves .",
    "if the above checks could not help in deciding cycle numbers , and/or there remained significant uncertainties in the @xmath1 curve or in its polynomial fit , the fit is shown by a dashed line .",
    "the @xmath1 were divided into two overlapping parts which were fitted separately with different order polynomials in the cases of some rrc stars showing very complex @xmath1 ( v10 , 64 , 76 , 95 , 126 ) .",
    "this procedure avoids strong discontinuities in the @xmath1 and period fits .",
    "however , the possibility that the period changes are in reality abrupt can not be excluded .    in the middle panels , period changes calculated from the @xmath1 fit according to eq .",
    "3 ( dashed lines ) are shown and compared with the results of direct period determinations .",
    "whenever the observations span over two or more consecutive seasons , then direct period determinations with sufficient accuracy may also become possible . in some cases periods",
    "were determined from single observing seasons , but usually the accuracy of these period determinations was not good enough to make any use of them .",
    "when no ambiguity in the @xmath1 values has arisen , i.e. @xmath9 seemed to be correct , this period was taken as an initial trial period for each data set .",
    "periods in the vicinity of @xmath9 were checked and the one that gave the light - curve with the smallest @xmath16 scatter in a least squares solution was adopted . in those cases",
    "when @xmath9 might be questioned , i.e. cycle number ambiguity has arisen indicating that aliasing might seriously affect the period determinations , a period search using the mufran package @xcite was performed . if there was more than one possible peak in the amplitude spectra of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , the peak which was closest to the period determined from the other observations was chosen if it was consistent with the @xmath1 fit as well .",
    "the error range of the periods was determined by checking the residuals ( @xmath16 ) of the folded curves using periods close to the one accepted according to the procedure described above .",
    "the upper and lower limits were set to the periods for which the scatter of the folded curves increased by @xmath17 .",
    "for the best light - curves ( some of martin s and kaluzny s observations if more than 200 data - points were available , and the quality of the light - curve was high enough to fit a higher order ( @xmath18 ) fourier sum ) , only @xmath19 was allowed .",
    "these percentages can be justified as the @xmath20 confidence region of the period assuming normal errors , correspond e.g. to @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath17 increases in the @xmath16 scatter of the fit in cases of n=250 , m=15 ; n=120 , m=10 , and n=60 , m=5 ( n : number of data , m : order of the fourier fit ) , respectively ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "checking whether the periods determined from eq .",
    "3 matched the actually observed periods within their error ranges could help in many cases to decide the proper cycle numbers .",
    "the folded curves of all the photometric data derived from the time - transformation of eq .",
    "4 are shown in the right panels of figs .",
    "1 - 3 . as a result of this transformation all the data could be brought into phase with the normal curve . in those cases where the cycle number or the shape of the @xmath1 fit was dubious , the solution that was accepted was the one that resulted in smaller scatter on the folded curve of the time - transformed data .",
    "we recall that these folded curves were matched to ccd v or to photographic @xmath7 normal curves depending on whether the star was measured by the ogle project or not .",
    "the scatter of the time transformed data and the agreement between the observed periods and the derivative of the @xmath1 fit served as checks on the correctness of the @xmath1 and its polynomial fit .",
    "different order polynomials with different weightings , interpolations and extrapolations were tested in order to get the most reliable solution .",
    "the aim was to determine a more precise @xmath1 curve which also enabled us to estimate the contribution of random changes to the global period changing term .    in table",
    "[ oc - dat ] the @xmath1 values , the order of the @xmath1 fit and the actual periods measured and their possible ranges at different epochs are given for v3 .",
    "the results for all of the other variables studied are available in the electronic edition which presents table  [ oc - dat ] in its complete form .",
    "the period change rates defined as @xmath22 are determined by using the polynomial fits to the @xmath1 curves .",

    "measuring @xmath25 in this way gives practically the same result as calculating @xmath26 from a quadratic @xmath1 fit where @xmath27 is the coefficient of the second order term or from measuring the period difference between the first and last observed epochs .",
    "it is difficult to determine whether a period change is actually random or monotone .",
    "however , the @xmath16 scatter of the calculated @xmath24 values during the century ( @xmath28 ) may give some indication .",
    "if the scatter is large , the changes are probably random . in the discussion that follows",

    "27 were excluded from the plot .",
    "four ( v9,11,56,59 ) have ambiguous @xmath1 curves ( all of them exhibit blazhko behavior ) while for eight others ( v91,106,132,134,139,144,149,150 ) , there are not enough data to draw any firm conclusion about their long term period changes . in addition , those stars that did not show significantly monotonic changes in their periods according to the criterion of eq .",
    "5 are also omitted .",
    "v56 and v84 were also excluded because their radial velocities indicate that they are non - members @xcite .",
    "altogether , there remain 45 rrab stars for which monotonic period change rates seem to have been followed .",
    "nine have decreasing periods ; one of them ( v104 ) has a steady period decrease at a very high rate ( @xmath33 days / day ) .",
    "the period of this star , however , is unusually long for an ordinary rrab star ( @xmath34 d ) .",
    "thus its inclusion in the sample may be questioned .",
    "the other eight stars have periods decreasing at @xmath30 and @xmath35 days / day magnitude rates . period increases at similar rates have been detected in 30 of the 45 stars .",
    "for the other six , no change or very slight positive period changes were detected ( @xmath36 days / day ) .",
    "the mean @xmath25 of the 44 stars ( omitting v104 ) is @xmath37 days / day ( 0.15 days / myr ) , the median is 3.8 or 0.14 in the respective units .",
    "it was shown by @xcite , that in contrast to the large chemical inhomogeneity of the @xmath0  centauri stars , the majority of the rrab stars have surprisingly homogeneous metallicity . using the empirical formula that relates [ fe / h ] to fourier coefficients @xcite , metallicities of 48 rrab stars observed by @xcite were derived . as no data were given in @xcite we list the physical parameters of rrab stars calculated from the light - curves @xcite in table  [ paramab ] ( see also sect .",
    "4 ) . in this sample ,",
    "40 stars have similar metallicities ; their [ fe / h]@xmath38  dex .",
    "of these 40 , reliable @xmath1 could be determined for 39 stars .",
    "considering the period changes of only these variables , the tendency for the periods to increase is also clear .",
    "positive @xmath25 values have been detected in 24 stars , only 4 have negative ones , 1 does not show any period change and irregular period changes are observed in 10 cases .",
    "there was one star ( v99 ) found to be more metal poor ; its steady period increase rate is @xmath39  days / day . of the 7 relatively metal rich stars excluding the non - member v84 and the peculiar v104 ,",
    "3 have shown steady period increases while only one is with decreasing period and the period change of one star is not monotonic .    regarding the blazhko type behavior ,",
    "we have found that 14 out of the 71 rrab stars clearly exhibit some type of modulation in their light - curves . excluding the non - member v56",
    ", there is no sign of monotonic period change in five of the stars , while out of the eight variables showing monotonic period variation , a decreasing period has been observed for only one ( v120 ) . although the periods of the @xmath0  centauri rrab stars span a very wide range ( @xmath40 d ) , all the blazhko variables have periods less than 0.7 d.    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the distribution of the normalized period changes ( @xmath41 ) is plotted as a function of the period .",
    "stars without a definite sign for their period changes are arbitrarily placed at @xmath42 .",
    "these stars are also found only among the shorter period variables , most of them have periods within a very narrow ( @xmath43 d ) period range .",
    "this unusual coupling of the periods of the blazhko variables with the periods of stars showing random period variations might probably indicate some kind of physical relation between these phenomena .    in conclusion",
    ", we have found that , although random variations dominate the period changes of 14 stars , period increases dominate in most of the remaining stars . among the rrab variables exhibiting steady period changes , only 9 have decreasing periods while 34 have increased their periods during the past century .",
    "we have constructed @xmath1 plots for 48 rrc type variables , but out of which 26 must be taken with caution because of cycle number ambiguity or not enough time coverage . the rrc sample shown in figs .",
    "2a - h clearly indicates that the period changes of rrc stars are more complex than those of the fundamental mode ( rrab ) stars . out of the rrc stars with well defined @xmath1 curves ,",
    "period increases occur in 10 , period decreases in 4 , random period changes in 7 cases , and 1 star does not show any period change .",
    "the equivalent numbers for the 26 stars with less certain @xmath1  -s are 4 , 3 , 17 , and 1 , respectively , if v168 is not included because it is not a radial velocity member .    a thorough examination of the light - curves of the rrc stars revealed the existence of some kind of modulation in at least 8 out of the 48 first overtone variables .",
    "this is a similar percentage ( @xmath44 ) to the occurrence of blazhko behavior in the case of rrab stars ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we call attention to a special group of variables v47 , v68 , and v123 ( showing also light - curve variation ) which we included in the rrc group because of their amplitudes and light - curves shapes , although it was shown in @xcite that their @xmath46 fourier parameters are anomalously large .",
    "@xcite also noticed that some of the rrc stars define a bluer ridge in the b@xmath47v.@xmath48.log@xmath49 plane , and among others v47 and v123 were found to belong to this group .",
    "the periods of these three stars are unusually long ( @xmath50 d ) , which would rather indicate fundamental mode oscillation and their mean magnitudes are among the brightest of the rrc sample .",
    "v47 and v68 are 0.1 and 0.2 mag brighter than any of the others and the mean magnitude of v123 corresponds to that of the brightest among the other variables . though the period changes of these stars are irregular according their @xmath32 parameter , in v68 and v123 significant period increases ( 1.9 and 5.5 d / myr , respectively ) have occurred during the past century .",
    "thus we may be seeing an indication of their more evolved status , although this is not as marked as in the case of the rr lyrae - like stars discussed in the next section ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "these latter stars are typically more than 0.5 mag brighter than the rr lyrae stars .",
    "there is , however a discernible similarity between the light - curves of these stars and that of the faintest evolved star ( v92 ) even though it has a much longer ( 1.34 d ) period . at present",
    "we can safely conclude that further studies , especially accurate color determinations are needed in order to clarify the true nature of these peculiar objects .    omitting these 3 variables and stars with too short @xmath1 segments , a similar plot of the @xmath41 distribution of the rrc variables as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the rrab stars is shown in fig .",
    "again , stars with irregular period changes tend to be found among the longer period rrc stars where the modulated ( blazhko ) variables are .",
    "@xcite made a thorough analysis of period changes of bl  her stars in globular clusters .",
    "they classified 5 of the @xmath0  centauri variables as bl  her type and found period increase rates in the range of @xmath52  days / day for all of them .",
    "the name bl  her is no longer used for these longer period rr lyrae - like stars ( short period population  ii cepheids ) , but the classification scheme has not yet been settled ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this category",
    ", we consider the ahb1 stars ( according to the nomenclature of @xcite ) .",
    "ahb1 stars are ` above horizontal branch ' stars which are either significantly brighter ( @xmath53  mag ) or have longer periods than the cluster rr lyrae stars .",
    "thus we also add v52 to this group because it is @xmath54 mag brighter than other rrab stars with similar period ( 0.66  d ) .",
    "based on its period we may also include v104 ( p=0.87  d , @xmath55  days / day ) into this group , however its very large monotonic period decrease rate represents a disturbing extreme in any of the groups .",
    "we also included v43 and v48 in our study , although no new observations were available .",
    "the period change rates we have determined for these stars agree within the errors to those of @xcite , showing the compatibility of our method with other period changes studies .",
    "the addition of new @xcite data to the earlier measurements strengthens the dominance of the monotonic period increases for v60,v61 and v92 .",
    "our solutions for v60 and v92 are , however , somewhat different from the earlier results @xcite mainly because we also take direct period determinations into account and this yields even larger period increase rates .",
    "thus the period increases observed in these stars are in agreement with their evolved hb status . in the last phase of the hb , during evolution towards the asymptotic giant branch , large period increases are expected .",
    "we have shown in sect .",
    "[ ab ] that most of the rrab stars have increased their periods by some @xmath56 days / day rate during the past century .",
    "this is in agreement with evolutionary model predictions for the late , redward phase of the horizontal branch evolution .",
    "the period changes along the post zero age horizontal branch , as derived from the @xcite models and from the linear pulsation period formulae of @xcite , range typically from @xmath57 to @xmath58 days / day . within the instability strip",
    "there is no metallicity and mass value for which the evolutionary period decrease rate is larger than some @xmath59 days / day , but period increases of the order of @xmath60 days / day do occur in the redward phase of the blue loops in the hb evolution , especially for the lower mass stars .",
    "the physical parameters derived from the light - curves ( jurcsik 1998b , and table  [ paramab ] ) indicate that most of the rrab stars in @xmath0  centauri belong to a very homogeneous population , and are already in the evolved ( redward ) phase of their hb evolution .",
    "thus , their comparison with model predictions of unique chemical composition models give adequate results , in spite of the fact that large chemical inhomogeneities have been detected in @xmath0  centauri stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] horizontal branch evolutionary tracks are shown for oxygen enhanced models with [ fe / h]@xmath61 dex @xcite . tracks for four different masses ( @xmath62 ) are shown .",
    "the position of the 40 rrab stars which were found to have [ fe / h]@xmath63 dex @xcite are also given .",
    "the luminosities and temperatures of these variables ( given in table  [ paramab ] ) were determined by using the empirical relations between the physical parameters and the fourier coefficients of the light curves ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the empirical @xmath64 and @xmath65 scales are shifted by 0.10 and 0.016 , respectively , in order to reach agreement with evolutionary results @xcite .",
    "this transformation yields a mean pulsational mass of @xmath66 with @xmath67 rms scatter for these 40 variables .",
    "linear pulsational periods have been calculated for different locations along the tracks where the fundamental mode period falls within the @xmath68  d range .",
    "then , evolutionary period changes have been calculated using these periods and the evolutionary time scales of the @xcite models .",
    "they are given in units of @xmath30 days / day in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] for those rrab stars which have well defined monotonic period change rates is in very good agreement with the evolutionary @xmath25 values calculated within the region occupied by these stars .    summarizing our results ,",
    "we have found that , for those @xmath0  centauri rrab stars that exhibit dominantly monotonic period changes , the period change rates can be brought into very good agreement with horizontal branch evolutionary model predictions .",
    "thus the observed period changes of these stars may directly indicate evolutionary effects .",
    "however , irregular period changes and one very large period decrease rate ( similar to those observed in other globular clusters ) also occur in @xmath0  centauri and no satisfactory explanation for these phenomena has yet been given .",
    "the much less regular period change behaviour of the first overtone rrc stars is also not yet understood .",
    "we are grateful to the referee , emilia belserene , for useful comments and suggestions .",
    "we also thank e. belserene for sending some of her unpublished magnitudes . c. clement would like to thank peter hanson and tom wells for making the iris photometer measurements .",
