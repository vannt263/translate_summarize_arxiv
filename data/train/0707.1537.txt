    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) mechanisms are often invoked to explain the launching , acceleration and collimation of jets from young stellar objects , x - ray binaries , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , microquasars , and quasars ( see , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "strongly magnetized jets , particularly those with a strong toroidal field encircling the collimated flow , are often referred to as `` current - carrying '' or `` poynting flux - dominated '' ( pfd ) jets .",
    "a large current flowing parallel to the jet flow is responsible for generating a strong , tightly wound helical magnetic field .",
    "the global picture of a current - carrying jet with a closed current system linking the magnetosphere of the central engine and the hot spots was introduced by @xcite and applied to agn double radio sources .",
    "this closed current system includes a pair of current circuits , each containing both a forward electric current path ( the jet flow itself , with its toroidal magnetic field , toward the lobe ) , and a return electric current path ( along some path back to the agn core ) .",
    "theory of magnetically driven outflows in the electromagnetic regime has been proposed by @xcite and @xcite and subsequently applied to rotating black holes @xcite and to magnetized accretion disks @xcite .",
    "an underlying large - scale poloidal field for producing the magnetically driven jets is almost universally assumed in many theoretical / numerical models .",
    "however , the origin and existence of such a galactic magnetic field are still poorly understood .",
    "in contrast with the large - scale field models , lynden - bell @xcite examined the `` magnetic tower '' ; expansion of the local force - free magnetic loops anchored to the star and the accretion disk by using the semi - analytic approach .",
    "global magnetostatic solutions of magnetic towers with external thermal pressure were also computed by @xcite using the grad - shafranov equation in axisymmetry .",
    "full three - dimensional mhd numerical simulations of magnetic towers have been performed by @xcite .",
    "recent x - ray and radio observations have revealed the dynamical interaction between the outbursts driven by agn and the background igm / icm , such as x - ray `` cavities '' with corresponding radio \" bubbles  @xcite .",
    "the cavities are believed to be filled with very low density relativistic plasma , inflated from the electromagnetic jets that are being powered by agns .",
    "this paper describes nonlinear dynamics of propagating magnetic tower jets in galaxy cluster scales ( @xmath0 tens of kpc ) based on three - dimensional mhd simulations to argue the jet / lobe transition @xcite and the stability properties @xcite .",
    "we solve the nonlinear system of time - dependent ideal mhd equations numerically in a 3-d cartesian coordinate system @xmath1 .",
    "the basic numerical treatments are introduced in @xcite .",
    "we assume an initial hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitationally stratified medium , adopting an iso - thermal king model @xcite to model the magnetic towers from agns in galaxy cluster systems .",
    "agn accretion disk can not be resolved in our computational domain , and thus the magnetic flux and the mass are steadily injected in a central small volume during a certain time period . since the injected magnetic fields are not force - free , they will evolve as a `` magnetic tower '' and interact with the ambient medium . in the present paper ,",
    "we present two different runs : one is called the `` unperturbed case '' in the following discussion , which is a run without any initial perturbation to the background initial profiles @xcite . the other is called the `` perturbed case '' , where a finite amplitude perturbation ( a few percent of the background sound speed ) is given to the velocities of the background gas @xcite .    the total computational domain is taken to be @xmath2 corresponding to a ( 160 kpc:@xmath3 to @xmath4 kpc)@xmath5 box .",
    "the numerical grids are @xmath6 in the unperturbed case and @xmath7 in the perturbed case .",
    "normalizing factors are a length @xmath8 kpc , a sound speed @xmath9 cm s@xmath10 , a time @xmath11 yr , a density @xmath12 g @xmath13 . the corresponding unit pressure @xmath14 as @xmath15 dyn @xmath16 , and the unit magnetic field @xmath17 as @xmath18 @xmath19 g .",
    "the initial sound speed in the simulation is constant , @xmath20 , throughout the computational domain , which give a sound crossing time @xmath21 , corresponding to a typical time scale @xmath22 myr .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 is equivalent to the unit time scale @xmath24 myr . in the king model",
    "we use here , we adopt the cluster core radius @xmath25 to be @xmath26 ( i.e. , 20 kpc ) and the slope @xmath27 to be @xmath28 in the unperturbed case and @xmath29 in the perturbed case . magnetic fluxes and mass are continuously injected into a central volume of the computational domain for @xmath30 , after which the injection is turned off .",
    "a magnetic energy injection rate is @xmath31 ergs s@xmath10 , a mass injection rate is @xmath32/yr , and an injection time is @xmath33 myr .",
    "distribution of density in the @xmath34 plane along with the poloidal velocity ( _ left _ ) and three - dimensional view of selected magnetic field lines ( _ right _ ) for the perturbed case . ]    during the dynamical evolution of magnetic tower jet , the narrow `` jet body '' and the expanded `` lobe '' are formed as shown in fig . 1 ( _ left _ )",
    ". the 3d view of magnetic field lines as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 ( _ right _ ) indicates that the magnetic tower jet has a well - ordered helical field configuration showing that a tightly wound central helix goes up along the central axis and a loosely wound helix comes back at the outer edge of the magnetic tower .",
    "the profiles of underlying external gas plays an important role in the transition of jet / lobe . the jet body is confined jointly by the external pressure and the gravity inside @xmath25 , while it expands radially beyond @xmath25 to form the lobe in a steeply decreasing ambient pressure .",

    "the jet axial current and the ambient gas pressure can determine the radius of the magnetically dominated lobes @xcite , that is , the internal gas pressure plays a minor role in the lobes which are typically seen in fr i radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "our numerical result shows the magnetically dominated lobes expand subsonically which can be seen in some observations @xcite . a preceding hydrodynamic shock wave beyond the tower , which may be identified as an agn - driven shock in recent x - ray observations @xcite .",

    "the interior of tower ( lobe ) is separated from the non - magnetized external gas via this discontinuity .",
    "figure 2 shows the distributions of forces ( _ left _ ) and the magnetic field components ( _ right _ ) along the radial directions . at the tower edge",
    ", the outwardly directed magnetic pressure gradient force is roughly balanced with the inwardly directed thermal pressure gradient force . on the other hand ,",
    "at the core part of jet body , the quasi - force free equilibrium is achieved . in the context of magnetically controlled fusion systems , the helical field in the magnetic tower",
    "can be regarded as the reversed field pinch ( rfp ) profile .",
    "the current - carrying magnetic tower jet , which possesses a highly wound helical field , is subject to the current - driven instability ( cdi ) .",
    "although the destabilizing criteria will be modified by the ambient gas and the rfp configuration of the tower , we find that the propagating magnetic tower jets can develop the non - axisymmetric cdi modes . both the internal elliptical ( @xmath39 ) mode ( fig .",
    "3 _ right _ ) like the `` double helix '' and the external kink ( @xmath40 ) mode ( fig .",
    "3 _ middle _ ) grow to produce the wiggles at the different parts ( fig .",
    "3 _ left _ ) @xcite . this morphological feature ( the jet is suddenly disrupted at the lobe region with visible [ external ] wiggles )",
    "can be observed in hercules a @xcite .",
    "by performing 3d mhd simulations , we have investigated the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic tower jets in the galaxy cluster system . under the gravitationally stratified atmosphere , the magnetic tower jet forms a global current closure system having the reverse field pinch magnetic configuration .",
    "the magnetic tower jet is well confined by the external gas pressure to form the collimated `` jet body '' inside the cluster core radius .",
    "the narrow jet expands radially to form the magnetically dominated `` lobe '' beyond the cluster core radius .",
    "thus , the profiles of underlying external gas play a important role in the transition of jets / lobes .",
    "the current - carrying tower jet , which possesses a highly wound helical magnetic field , is subject to the current - driven instability . in the gravitationally stratified atmosphere",
    ", the effect of thermal confinement on the magnetic tower jet will get gradually weaker as it grows . as a result ,",
    "a separation of current flowing path between the jet axial current and the return current occurs .",
    "therefore , the edge of the jet axial current becomes a free boundary against the external kink mode to produce the visible wiggles as seen in some observations .",
