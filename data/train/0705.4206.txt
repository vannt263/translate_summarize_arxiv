    "the effect of volume reflection ( vr ) of charged particles from bent crystal planes was predicted in @xcite and recently observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "its evidence was also found @xcite in collimation experiments @xcite .",
    "present interest to vr is mostly inspired by the possibilities which it opens up for the beam extraction and collimation @xcite .",
    "a principal advantage of the vr effect is its manifestation in the whole interval of tangential directions to bent crystal planes which greatly simplifies the crystal alignment .",
    "however a small value of the vr angle makes it necessary @xcite to use multiple proton passage which , still , does not allow to reduce the proton interaction rate with crystal at the lhc considerably @xcite .",
    "the particle loss in crystal would be considerably reduced if the vr angle was larger . in this paper",
    "we will show that the increase of the latter is made possible by the particle reflection from multiple sets of crystal planes inside one bent crystal which becomes possible when protons move at a small angle with respect to a crystal axis .",
    "vr occurs @xcite when a direction of particle motion becomes tangential to the local direction of bent crystal planes . till now only the reflection from crystal planes normal to the bending plane was studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in particular , an explicit expression for the angle of vr from such `` vertical '' plane was obtained recently @xcite .",
    "the stationary cartesian coordinate system @xmath0 with @xmath1 axis parallel to a set of crystal axes at the crystal entrance and plane @xmath2 parallel to the plane of crystal bending will be used to describe the particle motion outside the crystal  see fig .",
    "however to describe the particle motion inside the latter the comoving cartesian coordinate system @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is more suitable @xcite .",
    "both the longitudinal axis @xmath4 and the transverse plane @xmath5 of this coordinate system rotate synchronously with the particle radius vector @xmath6 by its azimuthal angle @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the bending radius , @xmath9 is the time equal zero at the crystal entrance and @xmath10 is the particle velocity .",
    "the dynamics of the reflection process from a `` vertical '' plane is described by the effective potential @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radial coordinate , @xmath13 is the planar potential and @xmath14 is the particle momentum .",
    "the comoving coordinate system is also suitable for treating the interaction with various crystal planes touched by particles moving at a small angle with respect to a crystal axis ",
    "1 . with one exception",
    "all these planes are `` inclined '' , i.e. form angles @xmath15 , @xmath16 , with the bending plane  see figs 1 - 3 .",
    "all the planes remain stationary while the horizontal velocity component @xmath17 ( we assume that @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , on the opposite , changes with time in the transverse plane @xmath5 of the commoving coordinate system ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . as a result ,",
    "different `` inclined '' planes , one after another , become tangential to the particle velocity .",
    "however the planes are not `` smooth '' , rather consist of axes forming the angle @xmath20 with the current particle velocity . at relatively large @xmath21 the maximum particle deflection angle by an axis",
    "is estimated by the formula @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total energy of a particle which is assumed to be ultrarelativistic and @xmath24 is an interatomic distance on the axis .",
    "a `` smooth plane '' approximation in which a particle deflection by the axes does not differ considerably from that by the continuum potential of the plane constituted by these axes can be used if @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the critical channeling angle of the considered plane set .",
    "on can make certain that the latter condition is equivalent to @xmath27 in the case of @xmath28 proton deflection by low index @xmath29 planes which we will consider as an example throughout the paper .",
    "the predictions made using the `` smooth plane '' approximation will be checked by the direct simulations of particle motion in the field of axes in the next section . for now let us consider a particle deflection in the planar potential of an inclined bent plane .    to evaluate the angle of vr from the latter we will introduce the rotated axes @xmath30 and @xmath31 being , respectively , normal and parallel to the local direction of the bent crystal plane and situated in the transverse plane @xmath5  see fig .",
    "the particle motion along these axes is governed , respectively , by the effective potentials @xmath32 and @xmath33 and characterized by the modules @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the corresponding velocity components , where @xmath36 is the speed of light .",
    "the energies @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the transverse nonrelativistic particle motion in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 directions are determined by the coordinates @xmath39 and velocity components @xmath40 , @xmath41 at the crystal entrance .",
    "the equation @xmath42 determines the turning point x - coordinate @xmath43 at a specified @xmath37 value . with a view to obtain explicit expressions for the particle deflection angles both in @xmath2 and @xmath44 planes we will follow @xcite introducing the x - component @xmath45 of the velocity of particle motion in the constant plane potential @xmath46 in the comoving coordinate system .",
    "since the turning point is the point of symmetry of the particle trajectory , we will , as usual @xcite , consider only a first half of it .",
    "the auxiliary velocity @xmath30-component ( 6 ) allows to write the time of particle motion from the point @xmath47 , @xmath48 , to a point @xmath30 , @xmath49 , in the form @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 note that since @xmath52 the particle moves with negative velocity @xmath30-component @xmath53 up to the turning point .",
    "the difference of @xmath54 and @xmath55 decreases fast and , consequently , the integral ( 8) saturates at @xmath56 or at the angles @xmath57 of the vector @xmath6 rotation . here",
    "@xmath58 is the planar potential amplitude which determines the critical channeling angle @xmath59 value .",
    "the negative integral ( 8) represents itself a reduction of the time of particle motion through the reflection region @xmath60 due to the local transverse motion acceleration in the planar potential .",
    "the time ( 7 ) which can also be expressed through the velocity y - component ( 4 ) : @xmath61\\ ] ] determines the angle @xmath62 of the local coordinate system rotation which enters the expression @xmath63 for the particle velocity component along the stationary axis @xmath64 .",
    "the couple of expressions ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) allows to represent eq .",
    "( 10 ) in the form @xmath65 sin \\alpha.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq . ( 11 ) reduces both to the initial velocity @xmath64-componrent @xmath66 at the crystal entrance and to the expression @xmath67 for the particle velocity x - component in the turning point @xmath43 in which , according to the definitions ( 3 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , one has @xmath68 .    applying further eq . ( 13 ) to the intervals of particle motion before and behind the turning point",
    "one can evaluate the reflection angle at arbitrary value of the crystal bending angle @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the crystal length .",
    "however here we will consider the most practically important case of large bending angles @xmath71 allowing both to neglect the difference @xmath72 and put @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( 8) . doubling then , as usual @xcite , the deflection angle at the turning point , one finally obtains the particle deflection angle in the @xmath2 plane @xmath74=-\\theta_{r}(r / sin \\alpha)sin \\alpha\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the deflection angle in the incidence plane which is parallel both to the @xmath30-axis and initial particle velocity and in which the particle trajectory is situated .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , naturally , reduce to the expression @xcite for vr angle from a `` vertical '' bent plane at @xmath76 .",
    "note also that the angle ( 14 ) is negative for sufficiently large bending radii at any @xmath77 .    in much the same way eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 9 ) can be used to write the velocity @xmath78 component in the form @xmath79 cos \\alpha\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] allowing to obtain the particle deflection angle in the @xmath44 plane @xmath80    eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 17 ) , naturally , describe the change of transverse velocity components accompanying a mirror particle reflection from an inclined bent plane with the angle of incidence equal @xmath81 . in general , since the turning point coordinate is determined by eq .",
    "( 5 ) containing the effective bending radius @xmath82 , the angle ( 15 ) can not be reduced to the expression @xcite for the angle of reflection from a `` vertical '' bent plane by the replacement of the integration variable .",
    "such a reduction , fortunately , becomes possible at @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is an inter - planar distance , when the angle ( 15 ) approaches the limit for infinite bending radius which does not depend on both @xmath8 and @xmath77 .",
    "in other words , the reflection angle ( 15 ) is bound from above by the same value of about @xmath85 @xcite as that from `` vertical '' plane .",
    "the angles ( 14 ) and ( 17 ) of particle deflection from an inclined plane allow to evaluate the total angle of mvr from multiple crystal plane sets touched by a particle inside a bent crystal .",
    "an important point here is that inclined planes constitute symmetrical pairs with complimentary inclination angles @xmath77 and @xmath86  see figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the reflection angles ( 14 ) in the @xmath2 plane from such symmetrical crystal planes sum up opening a possibility to considerably increase the angle of the vr in the bending plane @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the angles ( 17 ) of reflection in the vertical @xmath44 plane are opposite in sign ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , allowing the angle of vr in this plane to vary from several critical channeling angles down to zero . note that significant particle deflection either in the process of mvr inside a crystal or at repetitive passages through it will violate the symmetry of particle motion in the bending plane and can cause both `` switching on '' and `` off '' of some crystal plane sets from the mvr process . as a consequence the latter will start giving its contribution to the particle deflection in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "thus , to maintain the horizontal direction of mvr a special care in choosing crystal length , bending angle and orientation in the horizontal plane should be taken .",
    "to simplify the situation we will make here the angle of mvr in the vertical plane equal to zero restricting our consideration to the case of mvr in the crystal bending plane @xmath2 .",
    "let as consider a multiple reflection of @xmath87 protons from the bent crystal planes passing through the @xmath88 axis as an example .",
    "one of the three strongest planes @xmath89 passing through this axis will be directed at a right angle to the bending plane playing the role of `` vertical '' plane of `` single '' vr ",
    "see figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "we will also hold fixed both the crystal bending angle @xmath90 and symmetric direction @xmath91 of particle incidence in the @xmath2 plane ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and investigate the dependence of the mvr angle on the bending radius varying the latter proportionally to the crystal length @xmath70 .    in order to give its contribution to mvr , a crystal plane has to have an inclination angle @xmath77 exceeding the angle @xmath92 of particle incidence with respect to the bending plane @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "this condition considerably limits the initial y - component of particle velocity . in order to use the rest two strongest planes @xmath93 and @xmath94 having inclination angles @xmath95 and",
    "@xmath96 we will choose the value @xmath97 corresponding to @xmath98 . the main planes @xmath99 , @xmath89 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath94 will give their contributions to mvr at such an @xmath103 choice , while the planes @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 will not  see fig .",
    "2 . note that the chosen @xmath107 value makes the `` smooth plane '' approximation applicable , at least for the low index crystal planes .",
    "the bending radius dependence of contributions of the low - index planes to the mvr angle in the @xmath2 plane is illustrated by fig .",
    "the bending radius is measured in units of @xmath108 .",
    "4 indeed demonstrates that an additional reflection from the inclined planes increases the total particle deflection angle about four times .    to confirm this prediction based , in fact , on the `` smooth plane '' approximation direct simulations of the @xmath87 proton motion in the field of @xmath88 axes should be used .",
    "our simulation procedure , in many respects reminding that described in @xcite , was considerably accelerated by the use of the approximation @xmath109 to the potential of the @xmath110 @xmath29 axis in which @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the @xmath29 lattice constant .",
    "this approximation allows to treat particle motion analytically both in the field of each axis and in between the neighboring @xmath110 axes constituting a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice in the transverse plane ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . these semi - analytical simulations allow to obtain such two - dimensional particle distributions in scattering angles as that shown in fig . 5 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "corresponding one - dimensional distribution in @xmath117 turns out to be nearly symmetric , demonstrating the absence of large coherent deflection effects in the @xmath44 plane predetermined by the opposite particle deflections by the paired symmetrical planes .",
    "the same situation is observed in a wide region of @xmath107 variation at symmetric particle incidence with @xmath118 in the bending plane . at some @xmath107 values , however , a capture into the channeling regime motion in the field of various crystal planes at the crystal entrance makes the distribution in @xmath117 angle strongly asymmetric even at @xmath118 . in general ,",
    "particle capture by the numerous crystal planes at the crystal entrance , becoming possible when particles move at small angles with respect to a crystal axis , opens up other new possibilities for beam extraction and collimation which will be described elsewhere .",
    "the distributions in @xmath119 angle present in fig . 6 for several crystal bending radii confirm in general the predictions obtained in the `` smooth plane '' approximation .",
    "the positions of maxima of these and several other distributions are shown by circles in fig .",
    "4 along with an interpolating curve .",
    "one can see that the `` smooth plane '' approximation slightly overestimates the mvr angle at small and considerably underestimates it at large bending radii . in principle , the particle scattering from all the high - index planes can be additionally taken into consideration in the `` smooth plane '' approximation to fill the gap between the two upper curves at large bending radii .",
    "some of such planes , for instance , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , act coherently leading to the cumulative deflection angle distinguishable in fig .",
    "the `` smooth plane '' approximation is much less applicable for these planes than for the low - index ones at the relatively small @xmath107 values necessary to involve more crystal planes in the mvr process in relatively short crystals .",
    "in addition , a shallow planar potential of high - index planes leads to relatively high particle volume caption probability .",
    "all these complications make a direct simulation of the particle motion in the field of crystal axes the preferred method of the mvr study .",
    "the `` smooth plane '' approximation , nevertheless , gives both the simplest picture and correct intuitive estimate of the multiple volume reflection effect , which can be applied for both other crystal elements and orientations as well as for the negative particle case .    for the purpose of comparison , the distribution of protons reflected from a single vertical plane bent with @xmath122 radius is also shown in fig . 6 on the right . figs .",
    "4 - 6 visually demonstrate that the angles of mvr can more than four times exceed that of the `` single '' vr from a `` vertical '' bent plane .",
    "one can also see from fig .",
    "4 that the angular width of the mvr peaks exceeds that of the `` single '' vr one .    the mvr distributions are also more asymmetric than the `` single '' vr one . at this",
    "10% - 15% of the protons are deflected in the direction of crystal bending acquiring a positive velocity x - component ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) . at `` single ''",
    "vr such protons amounts to 3 - 5% appearing because of the volume capture into the channeling regime motion due to the incoherent scattering by both electrons and nuclei .",
    "however , when particles move at small angles with respect to crystal axes constituting crystal planes , additional volume capture becomes possible due to the coherent particle scattering by separate crystal axes .",
    "note that we have not considered the incoherent particle scattering by electrons which has to increase the particle volume caption additionally .",
    "on the one hand , the volume caption and deflection in the direction of crystal bending of ten or fifteen percent of the particles will make it more difficult to deflect the most part of them by a large angle using mvr in a long sequence of bent crystals . on the other , the increase of the mean reflection angle , of its angular dispersion and of the number of volume captured particles all add up to the broadening of the beam angular distribution . as a result , the mean square deflection angle of all the incident particles , important for efficient beam collimation @xcite ,",
    "can exceed @xmath123 in a 1 cm @xmath29 crystal in the mvr conditions .",
    "the main idea of the paper was that particles moving at small angles with respect to a crystal axis in a bent crystal experience volume reflection from the numerous crystal planes passing through this axis .",
    "both the newly developed model of particle reflection from inclined crystal planes and the direct simulations of particle motion in the field of crystal axes demonstrate that the total mvr angle exceeds that of the vr from a `` single '' `` vertical '' plane more than four times .",
    "the particle deflection angle magnification by the mvr , also used in series of parallel strip - like crystals , multiple - strip crystals , crystals periodically curved by groves or alternative tensile coating opens up new possibilities to improve the efficiency of both the beam deflection and collimation at the lhc and many other accelerators ."
