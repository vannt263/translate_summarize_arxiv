    "it is nowadays well known that the nonlocal properties of quantum mechanics @xcite enable striking processes in quantum information @xcite . in these processes",
    "it is prominent the role of maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "however , very often , the decoherence effects due to the environment transform the pure entangled state into a statistical mixture and degrade quantum entanglement in the real world @xcite .",
    "although purification schemes may be applied to noisy channels @xcite , there exist some mixture states which maintain interesting properties .",
    "an illuminating example is provided by the werner mixture @xcite , which is not a mixture of product states , nonetheless not violating any bell s inequality @xcite , but still useful for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "such states belong to systems with two discrete degrees of freedom like two spin-@xmath0 .",
    "however , information processing may sometimes involve hybrid systems where one degree of freedom has discrete variables and the other continuous variables .",
    "it may happen , for instance , in trapped ions @xcite , or in trapped electrons @xcite or in cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , it will be the aim of this paper to consider a mixture , which resembles the werner one , but one of the two subsystems is described by continuous variables .",
    "on the other hand , states and processes used in quantum information typically need of a well characterization @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished by using tomographic techniques @xcite . concerning the quantum state measurement , after the seminal work by vogel and risken @xcite ,",
    "a lot of progress has been obtained and further techniques and algorithms were developed @xcite .",
    "we would just mention the possibility of state reconstruction , for a composite system of discrete and continuous variables , by simply measuring the set of rotated spin projections and displaced number operators , @xcite .",
    "then , we shall provide the tomographic characterization of a werner - like mixture by generalizing that method .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in section ii we discuss the werner mixture and we extend the concept by considering one of the two subsystems with continuous variable .",
    "then we characterize such a state in terms of mixedness and entanglement .",
    "section iii is devoted to the tomographic method employed for such a state reconstruction . in section",
    "iv we present the results of numerical simulations . finally , in section v we discuss a possible implementation and section vi is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in his pioneering paper , bell proved that a local realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics is impossible @xcite , and for the case of pure states it is known that , when measurements are performed on two quantum systems separated in space , their results are correlated in a manner which , in general , can not be explained by a local hidden variables model @xcite . since the only pure states satisfying the bell inequality are pure product states , one might naively think that the only mixed states that do not violate bell s inequality are mixtures of product states .",
    "however , werner @xcite showed that this conjecture is false for the so - called werner states @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) stands for the identity operator of a single qubit ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 is the spin singlet state .",
    "a more general werner mixture can be obtained by considering one of the two subsystems , say @xmath6 , as described by continuous variables . a way to encode qubit in continuous variable systems",
    "could be the use of even and odd cat states which are orthogonal @xcite , thus resulting in the same situation of eq.([eq : rhower ] ) .",
    "instead , the choice we are going to make is more general and gives the possibility to explore a variety of situations .    that is , we now replace the states @xmath7 , @xmath8 of the second qubit with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where the latter are coherent states of amplitude @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively ( we shall consider @xmath13 throughout the paper for the sake of simplicity ) . therefore ,",
    "a werner - like mixture would be @xmath14 \\left[{}_{1}\\langle\\downarrow|{}_{2}\\langle\\alpha| -{}_{1}\\langle\\uparrow|{}_{2}\\langle-\\alpha|\\right]\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath15 , the above state does nt describe a real two qubit system , but rather a two qubit system with nonorthogonal states @xcite .",
    "of course , for @xmath16 eq.([eq : rhoal ] ) behaves like the state ( [ eq : rhower ] ) , but we want to study its characteristics for a generic value of @xmath11 . to this end , we map the above state in the two spin-@xmath0 hilbert spaces by introducing for the subsystem @xmath6 a vector @xmath17 @xmath18 and considering the non orthogonal states @xmath19 instead of @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . then , eq.([eq : rhoal ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath22 \\left[{}_{1}\\langle\\downarrow|{}_{2}\\langle\\psi| -{}_{1}\\langle\\uparrow|{}_{2}\\langle\\downarrow|\\right ] \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the degree of mixedness of the state ( [ eq : rhopsi ] ) can be evaluated by using the von neumann entropy @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the eigenvalues of the matrix representation of @xmath25 .",
    "we have calculated such eigenvalues in the basis @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and we have plotted the entropy @xmath31 in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we can see that also for @xmath32 the state is a mixture , then , it becomes more and more mixed by increasing the value of @xmath11 , but never reaching the maximum ( a completely mixed density operator in a @xmath33-dimensional space has entropy @xmath34 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that for @xmath11 ( @xmath35 ) arbitrary , eq.([eq : rhopsi ] ) is not a mixture of bell s states as it is for the werner mixture ( [ eq : rhower ] ) , i.e. , for @xmath36 .",
    "let us now consider the measure of entanglement .",
    "for a two spin-@xmath0 system the state separability is related to the partial transposition operation @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of partial transposition @xmath37 of a state @xmath25 are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "a density matrix @xmath25 for a two spin-@xmath0 system is inseparable if and only if its partial transpose , @xmath37 , has any negative eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "then , a suitable measure of entanglement can be defined as @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a negative eigenvalue of @xmath37 .",
    "it is worth noting that this measure satisfies the necessary conditions required for every measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "then , we have plotted in fig.[fig2 ] the quantity @xmath43 calculated by exploiting again the matrix representation of eq.([eq : rhopsi ] ) in the basis @xmath44 .",
    "we can see that the werner - like mixture is factorisable for @xmath32 , then , by increasing @xmath11 , its degree of entanglement increases saturating at the value @xmath45 characteristic of the true werner mixture ( [ eq : rhower ] ) .",
    "this latter value of entanglement is known to be sufficient to improve the teleportation performances over classical limit once the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) initially share the state ( [ eq : rhower ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus , it is straightforward to ask to what extent a werner - like mixture can be used for the same goal . to establish a threshold value for @xmath11 we are going to consider the teleportation fidelity . to this end , we first write the state @xmath25 through the hilbert - schmidt decomposition @xmath46\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 are the standard pauli matrices , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are vectors in @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , the coefficients @xmath52 $ ] form the real matrix @xmath53 describing the correlations between the two qubits . thus",
    ", the teleportation capabilities will depend on the specific form of @xmath53 .",
    "in particular it is shown in ref.@xcite that the teleportation fidelity amounts to @xmath54\\,.\\ ] ] then , in fig.[fig3 ] we have plotted the quantity @xmath55 versus @xmath11 compared with the classical fidelity @xmath56 .",
    "we immediately recognize the presence of a threshold value ( @xmath57 ) below which the werner - like mixture becomes useless for quantum teleportation .",
    "we now discuss the possibility of a complete characterization of the werner - like mixture through tomographic techniques .",
    "in particular , we generalize the method presented in refs.@xcite to non pure states .    accordingly to the state reconstruction principle developed in ref.@xcite we choose an observable , here @xmath58 , then we apply suitable unitary transformations to get a set of observables giving the whole state information upon measurements . in our case",
    "the transformations would be @xmath59\\ , , \\label{eq : u}\\\\ d(\\beta)&=&\\exp\\left[\\beta a^{\\dag}-\\beta^ { * } a\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which lead to rotated ( by angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) spin projection in the subsystem @xmath62 @xcite , and to displaced number state ( by a complex amount @xmath63 ) in the subsystem @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "then , it is possible to consider the following measurable marginal distributions @xmath64 having as variables the eigenvalues @xmath65 , @xmath66 of @xmath67 and @xmath68 as variables and parametrically depending on @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , measuring the state @xmath25 would mean the possibility to express @xmath25 as a functional operator of @xmath69 , i.e. to invert expression ( [ eq : wdef ] ) .",
    "this also means the possibility to sample the density matrix elements ( in some basis ) from the quantity measured by spanning the whole space of parameters .    in reality",
    ", we shall see that it is not necessary to consider all possible values of parameters . as matter of fact",
    ", we write the density operator ( [ eq : rhoal ] ) as @xmath70\\ , , \\quad \\rho^{\\downarrow\\uparrow}=[\\rho^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}]^{\\dag}\\,,\\ ] ] where each operator @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , can in turn be represented in the fock basis of the subsystem @xmath6 .",
    "now , we set @xmath75 and we suppose to retain only the measurement results @xmath76 ; then , expanding the density operator @xmath71 in the fock basis , and defining @xmath77 as an appropriate estimate of the maximum number of excitations ( cut - off ) , we have @xmath78 the projection of the displaced number state @xmath79 onto the fock state @xmath80 can be obtained generalizing the result derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now consider , for a given value of @xmath81 , @xmath69 as a function of @xmath82 $ ] @xcite and calculate the coefficients of the fourier expansion @xmath83 for @xmath84 . combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wup ] ) and ( [ eq : ftwup ] ) , we get @xmath85 where the explicit expression of the matrices @xmath86 is given in ref .  @xcite",
    ".    we may now notice that if the distribution @xmath87 is measured for @xmath88 $ ] with @xmath89 , then eq .  ( [ eq : wgrho ] ) represents , for each value of @xmath90 , a system of @xmath91 linear equations between the @xmath91 measured quantities and the @xmath92 unknown density matrix elements",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the latter , we only need to invert the system @xmath93 where the matrices @xmath94 are given by @xmath95 .",
    "the procedure can be repeated with @xmath96 in order to get the matrix elements of @xmath74 .",
    "then , changing the parameters so that @xmath97 and @xmath98 we can get the real part of the matrix elements of @xmath72 . instead , with @xmath97 and @xmath99 we can get the imaginary part of the matrix elements of @xmath72 , thus concluding the reconstruction procedure of the state ( [ eq : rhomat ] ) .",
    "as an example of the proposed method , we show in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] the results of numerical monte - carlo simulations of the reconstruction of the state  ( [ eq : rhoal ] ) once written in the form ( [ eq : rhomat ] ) . in this simulation",
    "we have used the value @xmath100 which make the state different from a true werner mixture , but still having nonclassical features as discussed in section ii .    in order to account for experimental conditions ,",
    "we have also considered the effects of a non - unit quantum efficiency @xmath101 in the counting of the number of excitations . when @xmath102 , the actually measured distribution is related to the ideal distribution by a binomial convolution  @xcite .",
    "statistical errors are accounted for as well by considering an estimation of the marginal distributions given by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the number of events with @xmath66 counts at phase @xmath105 , while @xmath106 is the total number of events at the same phase .",
    "then , following the arguments given in refs.@xcite , the quantities @xmath104 can approximately be regarded as independent poissonian random variables , whose means and variances are given by @xmath107 .",
    "the variance of @xmath108 may then be approximated by @xmath109 , so that the variances of the real and imaginary parts of the density matrix can be easily estimated using eq.([eq : rhogw ] ) ( and similarly for the other density operators ) .",
    "this means that the errors can be estimated in real time as the experiment runs , simultaneously with the reconstruction of the density matrix elements .",
    "other error sources leading to discrepancies between true and reconstructed density matrices can be identified in the choice of @xmath81 , @xmath77 and @xmath110 ( number of phases ) . however , as it can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] the reconstructed density matrices turn out to be quite faithful .",
    "in addition to the present case we have performed other simulations with different values of @xmath11 and several values of the parameters , which confirm that the present method is quite stable and accurate .",
    "the phase - space description corresponding to  ( [ eq : rhomat ] ) is given by the wigner - function matrix  @xcite @xmath111 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } { \\rm tr}_{2}[\\rho^{\\uparrow\\uparrow}\\,\\delta(\\gamma -\\hat{a } ) ] & { \\rm tr}_{2}[\\rho^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}\\,\\delta(\\gamma -\\hat{a } ) ] \\\\ { \\rm tr}_{2}[\\rho^{\\downarrow\\uparrow}\\,\\delta(\\gamma -\\hat{a } ) ] & { \\rm tr}_{2}[\\rho^{\\downarrow\\downarrow}\\,\\delta(\\gamma -\\hat{a } ) ] \\end{array } \\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is the fourier transform of the displacement operator @xcite .",
    "then , the wigner functions corresponding to the density matrices of figs.[fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , are shown in figs.[fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .    the reconstructed wigner functions as well turn out to be quite faithful .",
    "we would like to emphasize their particular shape .",
    "in @xmath113 there are two hills , one centered in @xmath114 and the other in @xmath115 coming from the random part of the state ( [ eq : rhoal ] ) , instead , the pseudo singlet part of the state contributes only to the bump in @xmath12 , thus producing the asymmetric effect .",
    "the opposite happens for @xmath116 .",
    "the shape of @xmath117 is due to the quantum interference given by the entanglement between the two degrees of freedom : in fact , in absence of entanglement @xmath72 would just be a replica of the diagonal parts @xmath71 and @xmath74 .",
    "we now briefly discuss a system where the werner - like mixture could be synthesized and even measured .",
    "it is a single electron trapped in a penning trap  @xcite , where two different degrees of freedom of the same particle can be entangled and also measured .",
    "an electron in a penning trap is confined by the combination of a homogeneous magnetic field along the positive @xmath118 axis and an electrostatic quadrupole potential in the @xmath119 plane  @xcite .",
    "the spatial part of the electronic wave function consists of three degrees of freedom , neglecting the slow magnetron motion ( whose characteristic frequency lies in the khz region ) , here we only consider the axial and cyclotron motions , which are two harmonic oscillators radiating in the mhz and ghz regions , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin dynamics results from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the static magnetic field , so that the free hamiltonian reads as  @xcite @xmath120 where the indices @xmath118 , @xmath121 , and @xmath65 refer to the axial , cyclotron and spin motions , respectively .    here , in addition to the usual trapping fields , we consider an external radiation field as a standing wave along the @xmath118 direction and rotating , _ i.e. _ circularly polarized , in the @xmath119 plane with frequency @xmath122  @xcite . to be more specific , we consider a standing wave within the cylindrical cavity configuration  @xcite with the ( dimensionless ) wave vector @xmath123 .",
    "then , the interaction hamiltonian  reads @xcite @xmath124",
    "\\cos(k z + \\chi ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\hbar\\zeta\\left [ \\sigma_-e^{i(\\omega t+\\varphi ) } + \\sigma_+e^{-i(\\omega t+\\varphi ) } \\right ] \\sin(k z + \\chi)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "the phase @xmath127 defines the position of the center of the axial motion with respect to the wave . depending on its value",
    "the electron can be positioned in any place between a node ( @xmath128 ) and an antinode ( @xmath129 . instead , the phase @xmath61 is related to the initial direction of the electric ( magnetic ) field in the @xmath119 plane , or to the phase of any reference field .",
    "the two coupling constants @xmath130 and @xmath131 are proportional to the amplitude of the applied radiation field . depending on @xmath122 and @xmath127 , the interaction hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hnodip ] ) gives rise to different contributions at leading order in the taylor expansion of @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "we immediately recognize the possibility of implementing the transformations ( [ eq : u ] ) , ( [ eq : d ] ) on the spin and cyclotron degrees of freedom by appropriately exploiting the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hnodip ] ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath134 can be realized by setting @xmath135 , @xmath128 , and then adjusting @xmath61 and @xmath136 .",
    "differently , @xmath137 can be realized by setting @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and then adjusting @xmath140 .",
    "these transformations easily allow to generate the disentangled components of the mixture ( [ eq : rhoal ] ) , i.e. , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , starting from the typical initial state @xmath143 .    instead , for what concerns the generation of the entangled fraction of the mixture ( [ eq : rhoal ] ) , we recall the procedure developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "that is , we consider the possibility of introducing pulsed standing waves through the microwave inlet  @xcite so that @xmath130 , @xmath131 become time dependent and @xmath144 , @xmath145 indicate the pulse area ( the duration of the pulse is assumed to be much shorter than the characteristic axial period , which is of the order of microseconds ) . then , nonclassical cyclotron states can be entangled with the spin states through the following steps @xcite .    *   first , we consider @xmath128 , @xmath146 , and a pulsed standing wave lasting @xmath147 ; *   second , we allow a free evolution for a time @xmath148 ; *   third , we consider the action of another pulsed standing wave with @xmath139 , @xmath149 , for a time @xmath150",
    ".    finally , if we consider the initial axial state as a gaussian state with momentum width much smaller than @xmath151 ( which is easily obtained in the case of the ground state of the axial oscillator ) , we end up with an evolution operator of the form @xmath152 , where @xmath11 is related to @xmath153 , @xmath151 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is then immediate to see that the initial state @xmath143 may evolve with the aid of @xmath152 and a spin rotation into @xmath154 this state has been already discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and constitutes the pseudo singlet component of the mixture ( [ eq : rhoal ] ) .",
    "thus , at each run of the experiment the desired component of the werner - like mixture can be synthesized , thus allowing the generation of the state ( [ eq : rhoal ] ) on average ensemble .    for what concerns",
    "the measurement , the addition of a particular inhomogeneous magnetic field ( known as the magnetic bottle field @xcite ) to that already present in the trap , allows to perform a simultaneous measurement of both the spin and the cyclotron excitations number .",
    "the useful interaction hamiltonian for the measurement process is @xmath155 z^{2}\\,,\\ ] ] where the angular frequency @xmath156 is directly related to the strength of the magnetic bottle field",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : hbottle ] ) describes the fact that the axial angular frequency is affected both by the number of cyclotron excitations @xmath157 and by the eigenvalue of @xmath67 .",
    "the modified ( shifted ) axial frequency can be experimentally measured @xcite after the application of the inhomogeneous magnetic bottle field .",
    "one immediately sees that it assumes different values for every pair of eigenvalues of @xmath157 and @xmath67 due to the fact that the electron @xmath158 factor is slightly ( but measurably @xcite ) different from @xmath6",
    ".    however , prior such kind of measurement , one has to deal with the transformations ( [ eq : u ] ) , ( [ eq : d ] ) which can be realized through the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hnodip ] ) as discussed above .",
    "repeating this procedure many times allows us to recover the desired marginal distributions , hence to sample the density matrix elements .",
    "in conclusions , we have studied the properties of a werner - like mixture and a reliable method to achieve its tomographic characterization .",
    "a useful system to investigate such states has been individuated in the trapped electron .",
    "there are other candidate systems that offer the possibility to generate and manipulate the studied state .",
    "we mention for example trapped ions @xcite , or atoms in cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , in such systems the studied state might involve two particles , or quite generally the two subsystems could be spatially separated .",
    "the experimental studies on this state might yield new insight in the foundations of quantum mechanics and allow further progress in the field of quantum information .",
