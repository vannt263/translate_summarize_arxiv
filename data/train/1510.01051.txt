    "in the past decade , there has been significant interest in topological phases of condensed matter  @xcite . in fully gapped systems ,",
    "the nontrivial topological phase is defined by a quantized topological invariant , which implies the appearance of the edge states on the boundary of the system .",
    "recently , research has also been extended to the topological gapless systems  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the weyl semimetal is such a representative topological fermionic gapless one  @xcite , which has pairs of gapless points ( weyl nodes ) in the bulk spectrum and fermi arcs on the boundaries , even for disordered ones  @xcite .",
    "an idea of weyl semimetal in condensed matter system was first proposed theoretically that it may be realized in a class of pyrochlore iridates  @xcite .",
    "recently it was predicted that it may be realized in non - centrosymmetric transition metal monophosphides ( including taas , tap , nbas and nbp ) based on the first principle calculation  @xcite .",
    "soon after the theoretical prediction , the indications of weyl fermions in taas  @xcite , nbas  @xcite , tap  @xcite , and nbp  @xcite , have been reported experimentally .",
    "another kind of weyl semimetal is the wx@xmath0-family material ( wte@xmath0 and wote@xmath0 )  @xcite . very interestingly",
    ", it was revealed that wote@xmath0 material is a superconductor with the maximum transition temperature at 8.2 k under pressure  @xcite , providing us with a potential platform to study the interplay between the topology and superconductivity in weyl semimetal systems .",
    "generally the superconducting state should be the ground state of a metal via the pairing interaction mediated by the phonon or other bosons .",
    "thus it is understandable to observe the superconductivity in weyl semimetals .",
    "actually , the superconductivity in weyl semimetal systems has been studied before  @xcite .",
    "theoretically the ground state of the weyl - type superconductors is still to be confirmed yet .",
    "starting from the lattice model , it was proposed that a finite momentum pairing state [ fulde - ferrell- larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state ] is favorred over the uniform zero momentum pairing ( bcs - type pairing )  @xcite . while an odd - parity superconductivity is proposed by later studies  @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that the fflo state is favorred for local interaction while the bcs state wins out for non - local interaction  @xcite .",
    "very recently , it was indicated that the bcs state is the ground state for an inversion symmetric doped weyl semimetals  @xcite .",
    "note that all of the above studies are merely based on a free energy analysis .",
    "the gap magnitude is self - consistently determined while the form of the gap functions is preset . to our knowledge",
    ", full self - consistent studies about the superconducting pairing in this kind of systems are still awaited . also ,",
    "for both bcs and fflo states , there exist some exotic features , such as the crossed flat bands in the uniform bcs - type pairing state  @xcite , and the spacetime supersymmetry in the fflo - type pairing state  @xcite .",
    "thus it is timely and of fundamental interest to study the competition of these two superconducting states in more detail and clarify what kind of state is the genuine ground state .",
    "another important issue in topological superconducting systems is the excitations of the majorana fermions ( mfs ) , which can in principle help us to realize non - abelian statistics and have potential applications in topological quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "generally in a bulk gapped topological superconductor , the mfs naturally appear at the system boundaries . while for the weyl superconductors , the bcs - type pairing state is bulk gapless , different from usual topological superconductors . and so far , the numerical identification for mfs in topological fflo states is also lack .",
    "thus it is insightful to identify the mfs numerically in possible superconducting states in weyl semimetals .    in this paper , motivated by the above considerations , we study numerically the ground state and the mfs in the weyl superconductors from the lattice - type model with the inversion symmetry",
    ". following refs .",
    "@xcite , we here consider the superconductivity in doped weyl semimetals .",
    "while different from their studies which are based on the free energy analysis , we here perform a self - consistent study based on the the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "our numerical results reveal that the bcs pairing state is favorable .",
    "the competition between the bcs state and the fflo state is studied in detail through the normal state fermi surface and the spectral functions .",
    "the physical properties in these two superconducting states are also investigated .",
    "the mfs in both the bcs state and the fflo state are studied numerically .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model and work out the formalism . in sec .",
    "iii , we perform numerical calculations and discuss the obtained results .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary in sec . iv .",
    "we start from a model hamiltonian including the normal state term and the pairing term , @xmath1 the normal state term @xmath2 is a general two - band model , given by @xmath3 with @xmath4 represents a site on the three dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 represents the base vector along @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 direction .",
    "@xmath11 is the on - site superconducting pairing term , expressed by @xmath12    the above hamiltonian can be diagonalized by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations , @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 are obtained from eq.(2 ) .",
    "the superconducting order parameter @xmath18 is calculated self - consistently , @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the pairing strength .",
    "the edge states of the system may be studied with a cylindrical geometry , i.e. , considering the periodic boundary condition along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "thus the hamiltonian can be reduced to a quasi - two - dimensional one by a partial fourier transformation , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the period of the lattice along the @xmath8 direction , and @xmath23 represents a site in the reduced @xmath24-plane . as a result ,",
    "the normal state hamiltonian @xmath2 may be rewritten as @xmath25\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\sum\\limits_{k_x\\underline{\\bf i}\\sigma}(\\sigma h-2\\sigma t_x\\cos k_x-\\mu)c^{\\dagger}_{\\underline{\\bf i}\\sigma } ( k_x)c_{\\underline{\\bf i}\\sigma}(k_x)\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\sum\\limits_{k_x\\underline{\\bf i}}[\\lambda c^{\\dagger}_{\\underline{\\bf i}\\uparrow}(k_x)c_{\\underline{\\bf i}+\\hat{y}\\downarrow}(k_x)-\\lambda c^{\\dagger}_{\\underline{\\bf i}\\downarrow}(k_x)c_{\\underline{\\bf i}+\\hat{y}\\uparrow}(k_x)\\nonumber\\\\&+2\\lambda \\sin k_x c^{\\dagger}_{\\underline{\\bf i}\\uparrow}(k_x)c_{\\underline{\\bf i}\\downarrow}(k_x)+h.c.].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the superconducting state , in the mean - field level , both uniform bcs type and fflo type solutions are in principle possible when the spin - polarized term exists . usually the fflo modulation is suppressed and the bcs state is the ground state with a strong spin - orbital interaction  @xcite . in the present model , a strong spin - flip hopping term",
    "is considered in the @xmath8 direction , which could suppress the fflo modulation along this direction .",
    "thus it is reasonable to consider the superconducting order parameter being uniform along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the normal state fermi surface analysis in doped weyl semimetals .",
    "generally the fermi surface should consist of two disconnected fermi pockets around the pair of weyl points  @xcite . in principle ,",
    "two competing pairing states are possible , i.e. , the inter - pocket bcs pairing and the intra - pocket fflo pairing .",
    "note that for both pairing states the net momentum of the cooper pair along the @xmath26 direction keeps zero [ see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "that is , the superconducting pairing term can be written as , @xmath27.\\ ] ]    the @xmath26 dependent bdg equation can be obtained from eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) , with the formalism similar to eq.(4 ) . the order parameter @xmath28 is calculated as , @xmath29    in the reduced low - dimensional system , we may define a spectral function depending on the site and partial momentum @xmath30 as @xmath31    the normal state hamiltonian [ eq.(2 ) ] can be expressed in the momentum space by a full fourier transformation , which is written as the @xmath32 matrix , @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the identity matrix and @xmath35 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the two normal state energy bands are given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 , the system may enter a weyl semimetal phase .",
    "a pair of weyl points @xmath38 may be obtained from the above energy bands through choosing appropriate parameters , with @xmath39)$ ] .    in the present work ,",
    "the parameters are chosen as : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . in this case , there exist two weyl points at @xmath44 . with the chemical potential @xmath45 , the system may be metalic with a fermi pocket surrounding each weyl point .",
    "we have checked numerically the our main results are not sensitive to the parameters .",
    "we first study the partially fourier transformed hamiltonian from eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) . the bdg equations are solved self - consistently and the superconducting order parameters are obtained based on eq.(9 ) .",
    "the superconductivity appears with a strong attractive interaction @xmath46 , qualitatively consistent with previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , here only uniform superconducting order parameters are obtained , i.e. , the bcs - type pairing is supported by a self - consistent calculation .",
    "we also checked numerically that this result is qualitatively the same when the input parameters and initial order parameters are varied . in detail , we consider different initial input order parameters : uniform ones ( bcs - type ) , periodic ones ( fflo - type ) , and random ones .",
    "the converged solution is always uniform when the self - consistency is achieved .",
    "the starting model of the present work is qualitatively the same as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , while it was indicated there that an fflo - type superconducting should be a most favorable state .",
    "it is interesting to note that their result is opposite to ours .",
    "another difference is that in ref .  @xcite superconductivity can occur for very weak interaction , which is also inconsistent with our numerical calculation .",

    "1(c ) and 1(d ) , respectively .",
    "as is shown , significant spin imbalance exists : the spin up quasiparticles have large spectral weight as @xmath56 , while the spin down ones have large spectral weight as @xmath57 . and",
    "it seems that the fermi surface nesting exists with the nesting vector @xmath58 , as indicated in fig .",
    "1(a ) . as a result ,",
    "if the superconductivity is completely determined by the quasiparticles on the fermi surface , the pairing between two quasiparticles with the momentum @xmath59 and @xmath60 should be favorable , with @xmath61 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the superconducting pairing is considered merely at a thin shell around the fermi surface .",
    "thus the superconducting pairing is determined entirely by the fermi surface topology . as a result ,",
    "the fflo - type pairing is supported and the superconductivity occurs for even very weak attractive interactions .",
    "however , for the present model , it is needed to emphasize that the fermi surface analysis is not enough to confirm the superconducting pairing because the fermi pockets are too tiny  @xcite .",
    "now let us study what kind of pairing is more favorable in more detail .",
    "we first illustrate the two possible pairing states in fig .",

    "the quasiparticles momenta from one pair are @xmath59 and @xmath62 , respectively . and for the fflo state , the momenta are @xmath59 and @xmath63 , respectively . so more conclusive results may be obtained by comparing the spin dependent energy bands at the momenta @xmath59 , @xmath64 , and @xmath63 . for the present model ,",
    "the energy bands from the bdg equations are usually the superpositions of the spin up and spin down electrons due to the spin flip term .",

    "the corresponding spectral functions for spin up quasiparticles at the momenta @xmath64 and @xmath63 are presented in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) , respectively .",
    "we first compare figs .",
    "2(b ) with 2(c ) to roughly evaluate whether the bcs pairing is favorred . at low energies , as displayed , the energy bands at @xmath59 and @xmath66 are obviously similar .",
    "the quasiparticle velocities are small near the fermi energy from both spectra .",
    "the increase of the density of states for low energy quasiparticles may increase the possibility of the bcs pairing .",
    "we then compare figs .",
    "2(b ) with 2(d ) to study the possibility of the fflo pairing . as is seen , the fermi momenta @xmath67 are nearly the same .",
    "this feature favors the fflo pairing . while , on the other hand , their quasiparticle band dispersions are significantly different , that is , the states at @xmath63 and @xmath59 have different energies when away from the fermi surface .",
    "this feature is unfavourable to the fflo pairing .",
    "we can estimate the volume of the two fermi pockets from fig .  1 or eq.(12 ) , which is only about @xmath68 of that of the brillouin zone . thus for the present case , the fermi pockets are very tiny and the finite energy quasiparticles are also important to determine the ground states . as a result ,",
    "when considering the quasiparticle pairing in the whole brillouin zone , the bcs pairing wins over the fflo pairing .",
    "very recently , it was also proposed that bcs - type pairing should win out for an inversion - symmetric doped weyl semimetal system  @xcite .",

    "<S> we study theoretically the superconductivity in doped weyl semimetals with an inversion symmetry based on the bogoliubov - de gennes equations . in principle , the two superconducting states , i.e. , the zero momentum bcs - like pairing and the finite momentum fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) pairing are competing in this kind of systems . </S>",
    "<S> our self - consistent calculation indicates that the bcs - type state may be the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between these two pairing states is studied in detail through normal state fermi surface and the finite energy spectral functions . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the fermi surface topology supports the fflo pairing while the finite energy band structure favors the bcs - type pairing . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the physical properties and address the majorana fermions excitation in these two superconducting state respectively . </S>"
