    "recent galaxy redshift surveys ( e.g. , 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have allowed us to map the universe on the largest scale ever and study systematically the detailed properties of the cosmic large - scale structures .",
    "it is confirmed by these surveys that the galaxies in the universe are not distributed evenly but develop pattern of network connected by filaments and sheets which in turn are separated by immense voids .",
    "voids are defined observationally as large regions with very low galaxy number density and shown to occupy approximately @xmath0 of the cosmic volume @xcite .",
    "the striking vastness of the observed void volumes inspired a flurry of research on the origin and properties of cosmic voids @xcite .",
    "it is now generally believed that voids are originated from the local minima of the primordial density fluctuations and expand faster than the rest of the universe .",
    "the very fact that voids are extremely underdense and expand faster has led many authors to assume somewhat naively that the shapes of voids should be spherical .",
    "in fact previous analytical and numerical works on voids are based on this assumption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "very recently , however , @xcite investigated systematically the shapes of voids by applying the excursion set approach to the density field in n - body simulations and demonstrated that the intrinsic shapes of voids are far from spherical symmetry .",
    "they claimed that voids are most vulnerable to external shears due to their low - density , so that their shapes are disturbed to be nonspherical in spite of their faster expansion .",
    "although @xcite focused on the shapes and morphology of voids , we note here that if the tidal shear plays a significant role in the case of voids , then it should cause not only the shapes of voids to be nonspherical but also voids to acquire the spin angular momentum .",
    "our goal here is to construct an analytic model for the spin angular momentum of voids originated from the tidal shear effect and test the analytic predictions against the data from the recent millennium run simulation .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in @xmath1 , the analytic model for the void spin angular momentum and",
    "the void spin correlation properties are presented . in @xmath2",
    ", the millennium run galaxy catalog is analyzed to determine void spin statistics , and the numerical results are compared with the analytic predictions . in @xmath3 , the achievements and caveats of our works are discussed , and a final conclusion is drawn .",
    "let us consider a lagrangian region in the linear smoothed density field . according to the linear tidal torque theory @xcite , the spin angular momentum of matter which make up this region , @xmath4 , is proportional to the tensor product as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the inertia tensor of the region , and @xmath7 is the local tidal tensor at the center of the mass of the region defined as the second derivative of the perturbation potential : @xmath8",
    ".    strictly speaking , equation ( [ eqn : ang ] ) gives a valid first order approximation to the spin angular momentum only when the lagrangian regions correspond to bound halos .",
    "however , to quantify the effect of tidal field on voids , we extend the validity of the linear tidal torque theory to the case of underdense proto - void regions and define the _ spin angular momentum of a void _ by equation ( [ eqn : ang ] ) .",
    "since a void is an unbound system , its spin angular momentum has a distinct meaning from that of a bound halo although defined in a similar way .",
    "basically , the spin angular momentum of a void is introduced to quantify how a proto - void region reacts to the effect of the local tidal force .",
    "the local tidal field will generate non - radial motion of the material in the proto - void region , leading the distribution of matter in the void to deviate from spherical symmetry .",
    "the magnitude of the void spin angular momentum quantifies the degree of this deviation , and its direction indicates the direction along which the maximum deviation occurs .",
    "it was shown by n - body simulations that in the overdense proto - halo regions the principal axes of @xmath9 are in fact strongly correlated with that of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite has shown analytically that the degree of the misalignment between the principal axes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 decreases monotonically with the linear density of the region .",
    "in other words , the more underdense a region is , the more misaligned the principal axes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are .    given these numerical and analytical findings , we propose a new hypothesis that a void forms from the initial underdense region where the principal axes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are maximally misaligned with each other . this hypothesis combined with equation ( [ eqn : ang ] ) leads us to expect that the alignment between the void spin axes and the principal axes of the local tidal tensor should be strongest for the proto - void regions .",
    "@xcite showed that the alignment between the spin axis of a lagrangian region and the intermediate principal axes of the local tidal tensor can be best quantified by calculating the expectation value of the unit spin given the tidal tensor , and they derived an approximate formula for it .",
    "their original formula is characterized by a correlation parameter , @xmath11 , in the range of @xmath12 $ ] , which was introduced to represent the degree of the alignment , which is nothing but @xmath13 times @xmath11 . ] between the spin axes and the principal axes of the tidal tensors .",
    "the case of maximum alignment corresponds to @xmath14 while no alignment case to @xmath15 . for the case of halo spins , they found @xmath16 empirically . in accordance of our hypothesis ,",
    "@xmath14 for void spins .",
    "now , with the value of @xmath11 set at unity , the formula of @xcite is rewritten for the case of void spins as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : spincorr ] ) indicates that the spin axes of voids are spatially correlated due to the spatial correlation of the tidal field .",
    "the alignments between the spin axes of neighbor void spins can be quantified by the two - point spin - spin correlation function which was introduced by @xcite for the case of dark halos : @xmath21 here , the constant @xmath22 represents the value of @xmath23 for the case of no alignment .    for the case of a power - law power spectrum , the void spin - spin correlation function , @xmath24 ,",
    "can be approximated @xcite as @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the correlation function of the linear density field smoothed on a typical lagrangian scale of voids , defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dimensionless power spectrum and @xmath29 is the top - hat spherical filter of scale radius , @xmath30 . since voids and galaxy clusters can be thought of the counterparts which are supposed to form at the local minima and maxima of the initial density field , respectively , we assume the typical lagrangian scale of voids are same as that of galaxy clusters , setting the value of @xmath31 at @xmath32mpc . since the concordance @xmath33cdm cosmology is well represented by a power - law power spectrum @xmath34 on the scale of @xmath32mpc , one can regard equation ( [ eqn : eta ] ) as a valid approximation .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the misalignment between the principal axes of @xmath10 and @xmath9 ( i.e. , the value of the correlation parameter @xmath14 ) is characteristic for those underdense regions in the initial density field that will eventually become voids .",
    "although the majority of the initial underdense regions will evolve into voids , some underdense regions could merge into overdense region to collapse rather than to become voids @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed both analytically and numerically that for the case of dark halos the separation vectors between the neighbor halos , @xmath35 , are aligned with the major axes of the tidal tensors . to quantify the degree of this alignment , @xcite proposed the following formula : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a correlation parameter in the range of @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the negative sign in front of the parameter @xmath38 indicates that @xmath39 is aligned with the _ major _ principal axis of @xmath40 unlike @xmath41 .",
    "the value of @xmath38 was determined empirically to be approximately @xmath42 for the case of halos @xcite .",
    "similarly , we expect that the separation vectors between the neighbor voids are aligned with the _ minor _ axes of the tidal tensors",
    ". then , equation ( [ eqn : dencorr ] ) should be also true for the case of voids .",
    "we assume further that @xmath38 has the same value of @xmath42 .",
    "now that the spin axes of voids are aligned with the intermediate axes of the local tidal tensors ( eq.[[eqn : spincorr ] ] ) while the separation vectors to the nearest voids are aligned with the minor axes of the local tidal tensors , one can expect that the spin axes of voids should be anti - aligned with the separation vectors to the nearest voids .",
    "the expected spin - direction anti - alignment can be quantified by the following correlation function @xcite : @xmath43 it was found by @xcite that for the case of small - scale galactic halos equation ( [ eqn : dencorrft ] ) can be approximated as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the typical lagrangian size of a galactic halo and @xmath46 .",
    "this approximation was made under the assumption that the tidal field does not vary significantly within the lagrangian distance @xmath47 .",
    "for the cases of large - scale voids , however , this assumption may not be valid since within the void separation the tidal field is likely to vary significantly .",
    "taking into account the spatial variance of the tidal field , we find that for the case of voids the spin - direction correlation function is better approximated as @xmath48",
    "to test the analytic predictions made in @xmath1 , we use the millennium run galaxy catalog carried out by the virgo consortium @xcite .",
    "the catalog consists of total @xmath49 galaxies at redshift @xmath50 in a periodic box of linear size @xmath51mpc , with information on various galaxy properties such as position , velocity , mass , magnitude , and star formation rate .",
    "voids are identified in the catalog by the void - finding algorithm described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hv02 ) which was in fact first suggested by @xcite .",
    "to apply the hv02 algorithm to the millennium run catalog , we first determine the values of the key parameters , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the two parameters , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , represent the distance within which a field galaxy is required not to have any three neighbors and a threshold for the minimum linear size of a void , respectively .",
    "for the millennium run catalog , the key parameter values we obtain are @xmath54mpc and @xmath55mpc , respectively . for the detailed description of the procedures to identify voids from the millennium run catalog , see our companion paper ( d. park & j. lee 2006 in preparation ) .",
    "the total @xmath56 voids are found from the catalog .",
    "the volume @xmath57 of each void is measured by means of the monte - carlo integration method described in hv02 . the effective radius of each void is then determined as @xmath58 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath59 is obtained to be @xmath60mpc .",
    "the density of each void , @xmath61 , is measured by counting the number of void galaxies : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number density of void galaxies , and @xmath64 is the mean number density of the total catalog galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : den ] plots the probability distribution of @xmath61 .",
    "as can be seen , the voids found in the catalog are extremely underdense with the mean density @xmath65 .",
    "we first choose only those voids which contain more than @xmath66 void galaxies .",
    "total number of such voids is found to be @xmath67 .",
    "the specific spin angular momentum , @xmath68 , of each selected void is determined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the mass of the @xmath72-th galaxy and the total mass of all galaxies in each void , respectively .",
    "the position and the velocity of the @xmath72-th void galaxy in the center of mass frame are represented by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "we rescale this specific spin angular momentum to be dimensionless as @xmath75 with @xmath76 , which is analogous to the definition of the halo spin parameter @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : void ] illustrates a few examples of the voids identified from the catalog with the directions of the void spin axes marked as short solid line on the voids .",
    "figure [ fig : log ] plots the distribution of @xmath77 for the voids from the catalog as histograms , which shows that @xmath78 has a log - normal shape .",
    "we fit the following log - normal formula to the histogram with adjusting the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 : @xmath81 the best - fit values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are found to be @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the value of @xmath77 spreads over a large range , revealing the strong shear effect on voids .",
    "we measure the cosine of the relative angle , @xmath84 , between the spin axes of each void pair in the catalog , and determine the average of @xmath85 as a function of the separation distance between the two voids .",
    "for this , we also use only those voids which have more than @xmath66 galaxies . the two - point spin - spin correlation function ( eq.[[eqn : eta ] ] ) is then determined simply by subtracting one third from the average , @xmath86 .    figure [ fig : spincorr ] plots the numerical result as solid squares with errors .",
    "the errors are calculated as the standard deviation of @xmath85 for the case of no correlation .",
    "the horizontal dotted line corresponds to the case of no alignment .",
    "as can be seen , there is a clear signal of alignment up to the distance of @xmath87mpc , which is almost an order of magnitude stronger compared with the case of halos .    the analytic prediction ( eq.[[eqn : spincorrft ] ] ) is also plotted as solid line for comparison . as can be seen ,",
    "the analytic prediction is in excellent agreement with the numerical result .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the analytic prediction is not a fitting model but derived from first physical principles under the assumption that voids form in the initial regions where the tidal and the inertia tensors are maximally uncorrelated with each other .",
    "the good agreement between the numerical result and the analytical prediction supports this idea .    in a similar manner",
    ", we also determine the void spin - direction correlation function ( eq.[[eqn : omega ] ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dencorr ] plots the numerical result as solid squares with errors .",
    "as can be seen , there is a clear signal of anti - alignment between the void spin axes and the direction toward the nearest neighbor voids , which is also an order of magnitude stronger compared with the case of halos .",
    "the analytic prediction ( eq.[[eqn : dencorrft ] ] ) is also plotted as solid line for comparison . we find a good agreement between the analytical and the numerical results for the spin - direction correlation , too .",
    "in the light of the work of @xcite who claimed that the tidal shear must play a strong role in case of voids , we have proposed a scenario that voids are originated from the regions in the initial density field whose inertia tensors are completely uncorrelated with the local tidal tensors . since the alignment between the principal axes of the inertia and tidal tensors plays a role of reducing the tidal shear effect according to the linear tidal torque theory , the hypothesis implies that voids should have very high spin angular momentum .",
    "we define the concept of the spin angular momentum for an unbound void to quantify the effect of the tidal field on the distribution of matter that make up voids .",
    "our analytic model based on the linear tidal torque theory have predicted that there is a strong spatial alignment between the spin axes of neighbor voids and a strong anti - alignment between the spin axes of voids and the directions to the nearest voids .",
    "our predictions have been tested against the millennium run galaxy catalog where @xmath67 large voids with more than @xmath66 galaxies are identified .",
    "we have measured numerically the distribution and correlation functions of void spins , and found that the predictions of our analytic model are in excellent agreement with the numerical results .",
    "the success of our work is , however , subject to a couple of caveats .",
    "the first caveat comes from our implicit assumption that the matter voids are same as the galaxy voids . in our analytic model",
    ", we consider the matter voids . while in the numerical analysis we deal with the galaxy voids .",
    "although the two types of voids are not necessarily same , they should be at least closely correlated with each other .",
    "the second caveat lies in the fact that there is no standard way to identify voids .",
    "unlike the case of halo - finding , the use of different algorithms could produce different results for some properties of voids .",
    "especially , the shapes and volumes of voids can differ significantly by the underlying criterion of the void - finding algorithm .",
    "if one use an algorithm which regards a void as a spherical region of low density , then all voids found by that algorithm would be spherical . in spite of this ambiguity in finding voids",
    ", we expect that our result on the correlation properties of the void spin angular momentum would not change significantly by the different choice of the void finding algorithm , since the correlation properties are basically determined not by the shapes of voids but by the galaxies in voids .",
    "another issue we would like to discuss here is a possibility of testing numerically our key assumption that a void forms in the initial underdense region where the misalignment between the principal axes of the inertia and the tidal tensors becomes maximum .",
    "although @xcite has already shown analytically that our assumption is true , it would be highly desirable to test it against numerical data from the millennium run simulation .",
    "for this , it would be necessary to find the lagrangian positions of all the particles that make up each void and to determine the inertia momentum tensor of each lagrangian proto - void region in the principal axis frame of the initial tidal field .",
    "as the initial density field of the millennium run simulation is not available to the public yet , the numerical test of our assumption is postponed .",
    "we hope to report the test result elsewhere in the future .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions .",
    "the millennium run simulation used in this paper was carried out by the virgo supercomputing consortium at the computing center of the max - planck society in garching .",
