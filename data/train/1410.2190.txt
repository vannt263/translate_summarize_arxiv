    "statistical mechanics models of `` disordered system '' such as glasses or spin - glasses are notoriously difficult to study analytically . nonetheless , since the early 2000s physicists have developed an analytic but nonrigorous approach , the so - called _ cavity method _ , to put forward precise conjectures on an important class of models called _ diluted mean - field models_. these are models where the geometry of interactions between individual `` sites '' is determined by a sparse random graph or hypergraph .",
    "apart from models of inherent physical interest , the cavity method has since been applied to a wide variety of problems in combinatorics , computer science , information theory and compressive sensing  @xcite .",
    "what these problems have in common is that there are `` variables '' and `` constraints '' whose mutual interaction is governed by a sparse random hypergraph . in effect , it has become an important research endeavour to provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the cavity method .",
    "the present paper contributes to this effort .    among the various predictions deriving from the cavity method ,",
    "perhaps the most intriguing ones pertain to the existence and location of phase transitions .",
    "in particular , according to the cavity method in a variety of models there occurs a so - called _ condensation phase transition_. this is a phenomenon that is ubiquitous in physics .",
    "its role in the context of structural glasses goes back to the work of kauzmann in the 1940s  @xcite .",
    "however , there are but a few rigorous results on the condensation phase transition in diluted mean - field models .",
    "the aim of the present work is to establish the existence and asymptotic location of the condensation phase transition in a well - studied diluted mean - field model , the _ random hypergraph @xmath2-coloring problem_. to define this model , we recall that a @xmath3-uniform hypergraph @xmath4 consists of a finite set @xmath5 of vertices and a set @xmath6 of edges , which are subsets of @xmath5 of size @xmath3 . for a @xmath3-uniform hypergraph @xmath4 and a map @xmath7 we let @xmath8 be the number of edges @xmath9 such that @xmath10 , that is , either all vertices of @xmath11 are set to @xmath12 or to @xmath13 under @xmath14 .",
    "thus , if we think of @xmath14 as a coloring of the vertices of @xmath4 with two colors , then @xmath8 is the number of monochromatic edges .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath6 gives rise to a boltzmann distribution @xmath15 on the set of all maps @xmath16 in the usual way : we let @xmath17=\\frac{\\exp(-\\beta e_h(\\sigma))}{z_\\beta ( h ) } \\nonumber\\\\[-8pt]\\\\[-8pt ] \\eqntext{\\displaystyle\\mbox{where } z_\\beta(h)=\\sum_{\\tau : v_h\\rightarrow \\{{-1,1 } \\}}\\exp\\bigl(-\\beta e_h(\\tau)\\bigr)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the partition function .",
    "we refer to @xmath18 as the _ inverse temperature_. clearly , as the boltzmann distribution @xmath15 will place more and more weight on maps @xmath14 with fewer and fewer monochromatic edges . for a given hypergraph @xmath4 , the key object of interest is the function @xmath19 , the _",
    "free entropy_.    while the definition  ( [ eqboltzmann ] ) makes sense for any hypergraph @xmath4 , in the diluted mean - field model the hypergraph itself is random .",
    "more specifically , we consider the random hypergraph @xmath20 on @xmath21 vertices @xmath22 , in which each of the @xmath23 possible hyperedges comprising of @xmath3 distinct vertices is present with probability @xmath24 $ ] independently . throughout the paper , we always let @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a real number and @xmath28 is an integer . the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath18 are going to remain fixed while we are going to let @xmath30 . the main objective is to determine @xmath31},\\ ] ] the _ free entropy density_. of course , in  ( [ eqfreeentropydensity ] ) the expectation is over the choice of the random hypergraph @xmath20 .",
    "an obvious question is whether the limit  ( [ eqfreeentropydensity ] ) exists for all @xmath32 .",
    "that this is indeed the case follows from an application of the combinatorial interpolation method from  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a standard application of azuma s inequality shows that for any @xmath32 the sequence @xmath33 converges to @xmath34 in probability .      in this paper",
    ", we establish the existence and approximate location of the condensation phase transition in random hypergraph @xmath2-coloring .",
    "more specifically , we are going to obtain a formula that determines the location of the condensation phase transition up to an error @xmath35 that tends to @xmath0 for large @xmath3 .",
    "this is the first ( rigorous ) result that determines the condensation phase transition within such accuracy in terms of the finite parameter @xmath18 ( the `` positive temperature '' case , in physics jargon ) .",
    "we call @xmath36 _ smooth _ if there exists @xmath37 such that the function @xmath38 admits an expansion as an absolutely convergent power series around @xmath39 .",
    "otherwise , we say that a _ phase transition _ occurs at @xmath39 . with these conventions ,",
    "we have the following theorem .    [ thmcond ] for any fixed number @xmath40",
    ", there exists a sequence @xmath41 with @xmath42 such that the following is true .",
    "let @xmath43    if @xmath44 , then any @xmath45 is smooth and @xmath46    if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 has a unique zero @xmath49 and :    * any @xmath50 is smooth and @xmath51 is given by  ( [ eqthmcondfreeentropy ] ) , * there occurs a phase transition at @xmath52 , * for @xmath53 we have @xmath54    in summary , theorem  [ thmcond ] shows that in the case that the `` density '' @xmath55 of the random hypergraph is less than about @xmath56 , there does not occur a phase transition for any finite @xmath18 .",
    "by contrast , for slightly larger densities there is a phase transition .",
    "its approximate location is given by @xmath57 .",
    "while in theorem  [ thmcond ] this value is determined implicitly as the zero of @xmath48 , it is not difficult to obtain the expansion @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , the proof of theorem  [ thmcond ] shows that there exists @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",
    "thus , theorem  [ thmcond ] determines the critical density from that on a phase transition starts to occur and the critical @xmath57 up to an error term that decays exponentially with  @xmath3 .      in this section , we explain how theorem  [ thmcond ] relates to the predictions based on the physicists `` cavity method '' .",
    "we also comment on further related work .",
    "as usual , we say that an event occurs _ asymptotically almost surely _",
    "( a.a.s . ) if its probability converges to @xmath12 as @xmath63 .",
    "theorem  [ thmcond ] is perfectly in line with the picture sketched by the ( nonrigorous ) cavity method , and its proof is inspired by the physicists notion that the condensation phase transition results from an `` entropy crisis ''  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it is expected that already for densities much smaller than the one treated in theorem  [ thmcond ] , namely for @xmath55 beyond about @xmath64 and for large enough @xmath18 , the boltzmann distribution can be approximated by a convex combination of probability measures corresponding to `` clusters '' of @xmath2-colorings a.a.s .",
    "that is , there exist sets @xmath65 and small numbers @xmath66 such that :    * if @xmath67 for some @xmath68 , then @xmath69 , * if @xmath70 with @xmath71 , then @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , with @xmath73 the volume of @xmath74 , we have @xmath75-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{z_{\\beta , i}}{z_\\beta(h_k(n , p))}\\cdot\\pi_{h_k(n , p),\\beta } [ \\cdot{|}{{\\mathcal c}}_{\\beta , i}]\\biggr{\\vert}_{\\mathrm{tv}}<\\exp\\bigl(-\\omega ( n)\\bigr).\\ ] ] given a hypergraph , the definition of the `` clusters '' @xmath76 is somewhat canonical ( under certain assumptions ) ; we will formalise the construction in section  [ secoutline ] .    with the cluster decomposition in place",
    ", the physics story of how the condensation phase transition comes about goes as follows .",
    "if @xmath18 is sufficiently small , we have @xmath77 a.a.s .",
    "that is , even the largest cluster only captures an exponentially small fraction of the overall mass @xmath78 .",
    "now , as we increase @xmath18 ( while @xmath55 remains fixed ) , both @xmath78 and @xmath79 decrease .",
    "but @xmath78 drops at a faster rate .",
    "in fact , for large enough densities @xmath55 there might be a critical value @xmath80 where the gap between @xmath81 and @xmath82 vanishes .",
    "this @xmath80 should mark a phase transition .",
    "this is because @xmath81 and @xmath83 can not both extend analytically to @xmath84 , as otherwise we would arrive at the absurd conclusion that @xmath85 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thmcond ] is based on turning this `` entropy crisis '' scenario into a rigorous argument . to this end",
    ", we establish a rigorous version of the above `` cluster decomposition '' and , crucially , an estimate of the cluster volumes @xmath86 .",
    "the arguments that we develop for these problems partly build upon prior work from  @xcite .    the key difference between  @xcite and the present work",
    "is the presence of the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely , @xcite dealt with _ proper _ hypergraph @xmath2-colorings , that is , maps @xmath87 such that @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the boltzmann distribution in those papers is just the uniform distribution over proper @xmath2-colorings , and the partition function is the number of proper @xmath2-colorings . in a sense",
    ", this corresponds to setting @xmath89 in the present setup .",
    "in particular , the only parameter present in @xcite is the average degree @xmath90 of the random hypergraph , whereas in the present paper we deal with a two - dimensional phase diagram governed by @xmath90 and , additionally , @xmath18 . of course , from a `` classical '' statistical physics viewpoint it seems less natural to vary the parameter @xmath90 that governs the geometry of the system and fix @xmath18 than to fix @xmath90 and vary @xmath18 .",
    "theorem  [ thmcond ] encompasses the latter case .    to prove theorem  [ thmcond ] , we extend some of the arguments from  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we provide a `` finite-@xmath18 '' version of the second moment arguments from  @xcite . independently of the present work",
    ", a similar extension was obtained by achlioptas and theodoropoulos  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we extend the argument for estimating the cluster size from  @xcite to the case of finite @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the argument that we develop for inferring the condensation transition from the second moment method and the estimate of the cluster size draws upon ideas developed for the @xmath89 case in  @xcite . especially with respect to the estimate of the cluster size , dealing with finite @xmath18 requires substantial additional work and ideas .",
    "the first rigorous result on a genuine condensation phase transition in a diluted mean field model is due to coja - oghlan and zdeborov  @xcite , who dealt with the proper hypergraph @xmath2-colorings ( i.e. , the @xmath89 case of the problem considered here ) .",
    "thus , the only parameter in  @xcite is  @xmath90 .",
    "the main result of  @xcite is that there occurs a condensation phase transition at @xmath91 , where @xmath92 . up to the error term @xmath93",
    ", the result confirms a prediction from @xcite .",
    "moreover , as theorem  [ thmcond ] shows , the result from  @xcite matches the smallest density for which a condensation phase transition occurs for a finite @xmath18 . in this sense",
    ", @xcite determines the intersection of the `` condensation line '' in the two - dimensional phase diagram of theorem  [ thmcond ] with the @xmath90-axis",
    ". additionally , bapst , coja - oghlan , hetterich , ramann and vilenchik  @xcite determined the condensation phase transition in the random graph coloring problem .",
    "this is the zero - temperature case of the potts antiferromagnet on the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph .",
    "thus , also in  @xcite the parameter @xmath18 is absent .",
    "the only prior ( rigorous ) paper that explicitly deals with the positive temperature case is the recent work of contucci , dommers , giardina and starr  @xcite .",
    "they study the @xmath3-spin potts antiferromagnet on the erds  r ' enyi random graph with finite  @xmath18 and show that for certain values of the average degree a condensation phase transition exists . but to the extent that the results are comparable , @xcite is less precise than theorem  [ thmcond ] . indeed",
    ", a direct application of the approach from  @xcite to the present problem would determine @xmath57 only up to an additive error of @xmath94 , rather than an error that diminishes with @xmath3 .",
    "this is due to two technical differences between the present work and  @xcite .",
    "first , the second moment argument required in the case of the @xmath3-spin potts antiferromagnet is technically _ far _ more challenging than in the present case . in effect",
    ", an enhanced version of the second moment argument along the lines of  @xcite ( with explicit conditioning on the cluster size ) is not available in the potts model .",
    "second , @xcite employs a conceptually less precise estimate of the cluster size than the one we derive .",
    "more precisely , @xcite essentially neglects the entropic contribution to the cluster size , leading to under - estimate the typical cluster size significantly .    the condensation line at finite @xmath18 in the potts antiferromagnet on the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph was studied by krzakala and zdeborov  @xcite by means of nonrigorous techniques .",
    "they predict the location of the condensation line in terms of an intricate fixed - point problem .",
    "( while conjectured to yield the exact location of the phase transition for large enough average degrees @xmath90 , no explicit expansion for large @xmath90 such as the one of theorem  [ thmcond ] was given . )",
    "because we take the limit @xmath30 and due to the presence of the sequences @xmath95 , theorem  [ thmcond ] is an asymptotic statement in both @xmath21 and @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , throughout the paper we tacitly assume that both @xmath96 are sufficiently large .",
    "we use the standard @xmath97-notation when referring to the limit @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath98 means that there exist @xmath40 , @xmath99 such that for all @xmath100 we have @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , we use the standard symbols @xmath102",
    ". in particular , @xmath103 stands for a term that tends to @xmath0 as @xmath63 .",
    "we adopt the common notation that for the symbol @xmath104 the sign matters , that is , @xmath105 means that there exist @xmath40 , @xmath99 such that for all @xmath100 we have @xmath106 whereas @xmath107 implies @xmath108 for all @xmath100 .",
    "additionally , we use asymptotic notation with respect to @xmath3 . to make this explicit , we insert @xmath3 as an index .",
    "thus , @xmath109 means that there exist @xmath40 , @xmath110 such that for all @xmath111 we have @xmath112 .",
    "further , we write @xmath113 to indicate that there exist @xmath40 , @xmath110 such that for all @xmath111 we have @xmath114 .",
    "an analogous convention applies to @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
