    "the satellite rotates with 1rpm around an axis kept fixed for a pointing period ( pid ) of about 50 minutes , then shifts along the ecliptic by 2. this keeps a point source near the ecliptic in the main beam ( 2 fwhm ) for about @xmath0 pids ( depending on frequency ) for each survey ; for sources near the ecliptic poles the coverage can be much larger . analysing the time information in planck data for a particular sky direction",
    "thus allows to search for variability in the sky signal .",
    "variability mapping is based on four - dimenional healpix ( ( * ? ? ? * grski etal .  2005 ) ) constructs called 4d - maps , which record for every sky pixel @xmath1 all contributions of a given detector at times @xmath2 and beam orientation @xmath3 , where the index @xmath4 refers to planck pids . to construct an average sky signal @xmath5 free from beam orientation effects",

    "a variability map is then a two - dimensional healpix map of a quantity @xmath6\\ ] ] where + @xmath7 @xmath8 is the number of entries for pixel @xmath1 in the 4d signal map @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the beam - reconvolved average 4d - map based on the _ artdeco _ map @xmath5 , @xmath11 is the detector white noise , and @xmath12 combines all instrumental fluctuations which factor on the signal ( e.g. , calibration , inaccuracies of the beam model ) .",
    "the definition of @xmath13 is motivated by the chernoff bound on the cdf @xmath14 , with for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the distribution of x - values over a sky map is indicateive not only of variability , but also to incorrect estimations of noise and instrumental variations ( see fig .",

    "the tail to large values of @xmath13 indicates the presence of true sky variability .",
    "a tail to large negative values of @xmath13 would indicate an overestimation of @xmath12 , an offset of the peak from @xmath19 an incorrect estimation of @xmath18.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "as the analysis of time variations in the sky is essentially background - free , our method provides a way to extract time resolved planck fluxes down to a time resolution of a few hours .",
    "if the position of a variable point source is known , the residual 4d - map , @xmath20 , can be beam - deconvolved to the source position by a simple division and thus provide an estimate of the flux variation , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a _ beamfactor map _ expressing the measured flux of a unit emitter at the source position in a beam centered at pixel @xmath1 and time @xmath2 .",
    "this method is used , e.g. , to extract time - resolved planck fluxes for co - eval monitoring of blazars with the f - gamma program ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "our analysis tools work on unified data structures , which ensures that all methods for variability analysis and flux extraction are applicable to lfi and hfi data in the same way .",
    "interfaces for intitial 4d - mapping are in place at both the lfi and hfi dpc .",
    "we expect that all planck frequencies will be analysed for variability , and science results prepared for publication well before the planck legacy release ."
