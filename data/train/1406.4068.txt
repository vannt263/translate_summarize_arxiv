    "in recent decades , technological innovations have produced data that are increasingly complex , high dimensional , and structured .",
    "a large fraction of these data can be characterized as _ functional data _ , and has sparked the rapid development of a new area of statistics , _ functional data analysis _ ( fda ) .    with functional data ,",
    "the ideal units of observation are functions defined on some continuous domain , and the observed data consist of a sample of functions taken from some population , with each function sampled on a discrete grid",
    ". this grid could be fine or sparse , regular or irregular , common or varying across sampled functions .",
    "most commonly , these functions are defined on a 1-dimensional euclidean domain , but this paradigm also includes functions on higher dimensional domains such as 2d or 3d image data or time - space data , as well as functions observed on manifolds and other non - euclidean domains .",
    "the genesis of this field was largely motivated by _ longitudinal data _ , growth curves or time series for which @xmath0 represents time , typically observed on sparse grids .",
    "recently , technological innovations in various application areas have produced functions on other domains , including spatial domains , imaging domains , spectral domains , and even genomic locations , which has brought with it higher dimensional and more complex functional data .",
    "the key idea characterizing fda is to think of each function as a single structured object rather than a collection of data points , which engenders a simplicity of thought that enables the building of models that can simultaneously handle complex structure both within functions and between functions .",
    "the recognition of fda as its own field was sparked in large part by the seminal textbook of ramsay & silverman ( 1997 ) .",
    "this book introduced the philosophical thinking behind fda , and described many aspects of fda including registration , clustering , graphical displays , descriptive statistics , and various strategies for regression analysis . in their final chapter",
    ", they made a key observation that two factors are simultaneously at work in fda : _ replication _ and _ regularization_. replication involves combining information _ across _ functions to draw upon their commonalities and make inferences on the populations from which they were sampled , while regularization involves the borrowing of strength _ within _ a function , exploiting the expected underlying structural relationships within a function to gain efficiency and interpretability .",
    "this article will focus on functional regression , the area of fda that has gotten the most attention in applications and methodological development .",
    "the goal of this article is to describe the historical development of work in this area , and to highlight the role of regularization and replication in the various modeling approaches that have been developed .",
    "first will be an overview of basis functions , key building blocks for functional regression methods , followed by a description of the general strategies used for regularization in functional regression using various basis functions .",
    "next , the methodological developments for each type of functional regression will be described in turn : [ 1 ] functional predictor regression ( scalar - on - function ) , [ 2 ] functional response regression ( function - on - scalar ) , and [ 3 ] function - on - function regression .",
    "each section will begin with a general discussion of the role of replication and regularization in the given type of regression , and then step through the methodological development in a historical manner , at times deviating from the historical timeline to mention closely related work or describe a cluster of work done by the same researchers",
    ". the primary focus will be on modeling and methodology , not so much on theory or computations , highlighting the modeling structures that have been developed and the various regularization approaches employed .",
    "the end of each section will contain a summary and a list of publicly available software for fitting some of the methods discussed .",
    "while much work has focused on point estimation , some papers have highlighted the inferential capabilities of their methods , and in these cases inferential approaches will be discussed , which include point wise and joint intervals , variable selection , and hypothesis testing , based on either asymptotic results , bootstrap , or bayesian modeling .",
    "most methods involve linear regression and independently sampled 1d euclidean functions , but others are more advanced , handling nonlinear regression , correlated functions , and functions on higher dimensional domains like images .",
    "the presentation will highlight these advances .",
    "in this section , three functional data sets are introduced to highlight some different types of functional data and provide a concrete backdrop for the discussion of functional regression methods .",
    "for the first two , functions are defined on a 1d euclidean domain , with the first ( _ dti data set _ ) having relatively simple , smooth functions sampled on a moderately sized grid ( @xmath1 observations per curve ) , and the second ( _ mass spectrometry data set _ ) having complex , spiky functions sampled on a high dimensional grid ( @xmath2 observations per curve ) .",
    "the third ( _ glaucoma data set _ ) is included to illustrate functional data on non - euclidean domains , with functions defined on a 2d partial spherical domain .",
    "figure [ fig : data ] contains representative plots of these data sets .",
    "one can refer back to these example data in thinking about the different functional regression methods and associated modeling issues described in this article .        * * ( simple , smooth functions , moderate grid ) : this data set contains fractional anisotropy ( fa ) tract profiles from diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) data collected at johns hopkins university and the kennedy - krieger institute , and is freely available as part of the @xmath3 r package .",
    "the data set involves 382 dti scans from a total of 142 subjects , 100 with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and 42 healthy controls . from each dti scan , fa profiles are obtained along the corpus callosum ( fa - cca ) and right corticospinal ( fa - rcst ) tracts , yielding functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "additionally , for each subject the data includes their ms status @xmath6 if ms , @xmath7 if control , plus their paced auditory serial additional test ( pasat ) score @xmath8 , a continuous measurement of cognitive function relating to speed and flexibility in processing auditory information .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : data](a)-(b ) , these functions are relatively simple and smooth and sampled on a moderately sized grid of 93 ( for cca ) or 55 ( for rcst ) positions .",
    "this data set can be used to illustrate all three types of functional regression described in this article , and has been used in numerous papers in current literature ( greven et al .",

    "( 2005 ) , blood serum was taken from 139 pancreatic cancer patients and 117 healthy controls , and run on a mass spectrometry instrument to obtain proteomic spectra @xmath17 for each sample @xmath18 .",
    "each spectrum is a spiky function whose peaks correspond to proteins and peptides with molecular mass ( actually mass per unit charge m / z ) roughly equal to @xmath0 , and whose spectral intensity approximates its relative abundance .",
    "each spectrum is observed on a high dimensional grid of size @xmath19 for a range of m / z values from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "as can be see in in figure [ fig : data](c ) , these functions are spiky and irregular , and illustrate a type of complex , high - dimensional functional data that is not the focus of most functional regression development , but increasingly encountered in many applications . for data like these , flexibility , adaptiveness , and computational efficiency are important considerations for methodology development .",

    "functional mixed models ( section [ sec : frr ] ) need to be used to account for correlation between eyes from the same subject , and for longitudinal correlations across measurements for different pressure levels in the same eye .",
    "if not wanting to assume linearity in age , semiparametric functional mixed models can be used to estimate @xmath35 that captures the effect of age on mps as a smooth nonparametric effect varying across locations within the eye , indexed by @xmath36 .",
    "one such modeling effort for these data is presented in lee et al .",
    "this example illustrates how functional regression approaches can simultaneously handle complex within- and across - function structure and be applied to functions on non - euclidean domains .",
    "inherently , any statistical method combines information across observations in some way to make inference on the populations from which they were sampled .",
    "most basic methods involve either _ replication _ , combining information _ across _ sampled units , or _ regularization _ , combining information _ within _ sampled units .",
    "fda involves both .    to expound , replication is the concept exploited in most commonly used statistical models . for example ,",
    "given replicate sampled pairs of responses and predictors , regression models combine information across these pairs to discover the relationship between them and build a predictive model .",
    "replication is also the underlying concept involved when accounting for correlation among the sampled observations , e.g. induced by multi - level designs , in which case information is combined together in a careful way depending on the relative variabilities and sample sizes at each stochastic level , for example using mixed effect models or bayesian hierarchical models . in fda",
    ", we consider each function as the sampled unit , and replication involves how our models combine information across functions so we can make inferences on the populations from which they were drawn .",
    "regularization involves borrowing strength across observations within a function that are expected to be similar to each other , exploiting their expected regularity even though they are discretely observed .",
    "this is the key idea behind ( single function ) nonparametric regression or kriging in spatial data analysis , where estimation of a process at some location @xmath0 is improved by borrowing strength from nearby observations within the function using some smoothing mechanism . for most fda methods ,",
    "regularization involves global smoothing , implying an assumption that similarity within the function is strictly related to distance between the observations",
    ". global smoothing may not be sufficient to adequately capture the internal structure of some functions , especially more complex high dimensional ones such as the _ mass spectrometry data _ in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "for example , some functions are _ spatially heterogeneous _ , meaning some parts of the function are smoother ( i.e. more similar across @xmath0 ) than others , and in other cases there are distant parts of the function that are correlated with each other . in these cases ,",
    "more general forms of regularization are needed .",
    "regularization is closely tied to the modeling of correlation for gaussian data .",
    "it can be applied in the likelihood of the functional data to capture the within - function correlation , or in penalties or priors for functional coefficients in the regression model to improve their estimation .",
    "the key idea is that we believe that by exploiting this regularity , we can gain more efficient and interpretable estimators , better predictions , and at times calculations that are potentially faster and more stable .",
    "replication and regularization can be done separately using a two - step approach or together using a unified modeling approach .",
    "for example , in functional response regression when functions are all sampled on a common grid , a two - step approach would involve fitting separate regression models for each @xmath0 and then smoothing the functional coefficients , or smoothing each individual function and then performing separate regression models on a grid of values for @xmath0 .",
    "this approach is convenient , but may be inferior to unified modeling approaches that perform replication and regularization jointly , since the borrowing of strength across functions can lead to more efficient regularization , and the regularization can more accurately inform how information is combined across functions ( i.e. replication ) . at places , this article will highlight cases in which unified modeling is done and evidence of these benefits have been shown .",
    "basis functions are the building blocks of fda and typically determine the mechanism by which regularization is done .",
    "each basis function defines a linear combination among the locations within the function , which in effect induces a correlation among those functional regions sharing loadings of high magnitude , and thus establishing a specific framework for borrowing strength .",
    "their use also allows finite numbers of basis coefficients to yield estimates and inference in an infinite - dimensional function space",
    ". some of the most commonly used basis functions in fda are splines , fourier series , wavelets , and principal components , and each is suited for functions with certain characteristics .",
    "splines are well suited to modeling smooth functions , and given their usual fitting approach work better when the dimension of the observational grid is not too high .",
    "fourier series transform the functions into the frequency domain , and work well for functions with stationary periodic characteristics .",
    "wavelets are multi - resolution basis functions that decompose a signal in a dual frequency - time domain , and their local support make them ideal for irregular functions with spikes , discontinuities , and other nonstationary features .",
    "both fourier and wavelet bases possess fast algorithms for calculating basis coefficients and reconstructing the function from the basis coefficients when functions are regularly sampled on a grid of size @xmath37 , with fourier o(@xmath37log@xmath37 ) and wavelets o(@xmath37 ) , so are well - suited for functions sampled on high - dimensional , regular grids .",
    "principal components ( pcs ) are basis functions empirically estimated from the data using eigen - decompositions .",
    "they are well - suited for functions with simple structure leading to rapidly decaying eigenvalues , and are able to capture distant , non - local correlations within the functions .",
    "we will discuss some considerations and developments regarding the use of pc for fda below .",
    "kernels can also be thought of as basis functions that define a weighting over which local mean estimation or regression is done , and are suitable for smooth functions when global bandwidths are used , and can be used with spatially heterogenous functions when varying bandwidths are used .",
    "lin et al . ( 2004 ) showed the equivalence between certain kernel and spline models .",
    "regularization of functions is accomplished by applying one of three operations to its basis coefficients : [ 1 ] _ truncation _ , [ 2 ] _ roughness penalties _",
    "( l2 penalization ) , or [ 3 ] _ sparsity _ ( l1 penalization ) . for ordered bases ,",
    "truncation involves the elimination of all bases after a certain point .",
    "this is most commonly utilized in pca , keeping only the first few pcs explaining the most variability , but can also be used with fourier and wavelet bases ordered by increasing frequency if low - pass filters are applied , with orthogonal polynomials if polynomials above a certain order are removed , or with unpenalized regression splines for which the use of limited pre - specified knot locations can be viewed as a form of basis truncation .",
    "roughness penalties penalize the integrated squared second derivative of the function , which involves some type of generalized l2 penalty on the basis coefficients .",
    "given a single smoothing parameter , this leads to global smoothing and a ridge regression - like structure .",
    "fitting can be done by penalized least squares ( penls ) , a bayesian model with gaussian priors , or a linear mixed model , which is especially convenient when using demmler - reinsch basis functions ( demmler and reinsch 1975 ) that are orthogonalized with respect to the roughness penalty .",
    "smoothing splines involve natural cubic spline bases with knots at each observed data point while incorporating this roughness penalty , and penalized splines involve roughness penalties but using fewer knots .",
    "other l2 penalties have been used in place of pure roughness penalties , with marx & eilers ( 1996 ) proposing an l2 penalty on the first difference of b - spline coefficients in their _ p - spline _ construction , and ruppert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) inducing a type of l2 penalization by assuming independent and identically distributed ( iid ) gaussian distributions for truncated power series spline coefficients .",
    "sparsity in the basis coefficients is related to l1 penalization , which can be induced through bayesian modeling using sparsity priors that involve stochastic search variable selection ( ssvs , george & mcculloch 1993 ) or nonlinear shrinkage ( bayesian lasso , park & casella 2008 ; normal - gamma , griffin & brown 2010 ; horseshoe , carvahlo et al .",
    "2010 ; generalized beta , armagan et al . 2011 ) , or though penls using l1 sparsity penalties such as the lasso ( tibshirani 1991 ) or one of its many variants .",
    "l1 penalization is a standard approach for wavelet regression , and leads to a type of adaptive regularization that removes noise while preserving dominant local features , accommodating spatial heterogeneity ( donoho and johnstone 1995 ) .",
    "sparsity is also the regularization mechanism of free - knot splines ( gervini 2006 ) , and has been used as an alternative to truncation in pc regression when one does not want to assume that the pc dimensions explaining the most variability are necessarily the most predictive ( joliffe 1982 ) .",
    "principal components play a key role in fda and are worthy of some additional discussion . in principal component analysis ( pca ) ,",
    "the basis functions are empirically generated by estimating the within - function covariance surface , combining information across the replicated functions , and are thus an example of replication informing regularization .",
    "they have been a major workhorse in fda , especially for simple smooth functions in which case it is common for a few pcs to explain a high percentage of the total variability .",
    "care must be taken , however , in using pca for very complex , high dimensional functional data for which the decay rate in the eigenvalues is slow , especially when the number of functions is small . in certain high dimensional ,",
    "low sample size settings pcs have been shown to be inconsistent ( hall et al .",
    "2005 ; baik & silverstein 2006 ; jung & marron 2009 ; lee et al . 2010 ; shen et al .",
    "2013 ) , as in these cases there is insufficient sample size to empirically estimate the complex covariance surface characterizing the functional process .",
    "these problems can be at least partially mitigated at times by using one of the functional principal component ( fpc ) approaches that incorporate regularization in the pc calculation and effectively reduce the dimensionality of the covariance surface , although it is currently not clear how to decide in a given situation whether these methods are sufficient to lead to well - estimated eigenfunctions .",
    "various approaches have been used to estimate regularized or sparse empirical basis functions and compute the corresponding scores using fpca .",
    "two - step approaches have been proposed , whereby one first smooths the individual curves and then computes pcs , or computes the pcs and then smooths the eigenfunctions ( ramsay & silverman 2005 , ch 8) .",
    "besse & ramsay ( 1986 ) smoothed sparse functional data to interpolate and then applied pca .",
    "james ( 2002 ) first smoothed the raw curves using natural cubic splines and then computed the pcs on the spline coefficients .",
    "johnstone & lu ( 2009 ) talked about sparse pca , and described an approach that involves using sparsity in the wavelet space to obtain sparse pca , and mostacci et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , rislien & winje ( 2013 ) , and meyer et al .",
    "( 2013 ) all used approaches involving wavelet denoising followed by pc calculation .",
    "silverman ( 1996 ) introduced a unified approach for calculating pcs while penalizing roughness .",
    "other advances in pca have allowed the calculation of pc scores in settings with functions observed on sparse and variable grids and for multi - level models with multiple sources of stochastic variability .",
    "in modeling repeated samples of functions within dose groups , staniswallis & lee ( 1998 ) used kernels to smooth the covariance surface from which the fpcs are estimated , using quadrature to estimate the fpc scores when functions are sampled on sparse , irregular grids that vary across functions .",
    "yao et al . ( 2005a ) developed a similar approach _",
    "principal analysis by conditional expectation _ ( pace ) , which borrows strength across sparse curves using a kernel - smoothed covariance matrix to estimate the eigenfunctions and computing the individual pc score as blups of a linear mixed model .",
    "staniswallis & lee ( 1998 ) performed separate fpc decompositions at two levels of a multi - level functional model , dose group and subject within dose group . in a more general context , di et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented an approach ( ml - fpca ) that obtains separate fpc scores at each level of multi - level functional data based on smoothed covariance estimates constructed from method - of - moment estimates at the various levels of the multi - level models for densely sampled functions , and later generalized this to sparsely observed functions ( di , et al . 2014 ) .",

    "most work in functional predictor regression is based on a variant of the functional linear model ( flm ) , first introduced by ramsay & dalzell ( 1991 ) and first written in its commonly encountered form by hastie & mallows ( 1993 ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a continuous response , @xmath41 a functional predictor , @xmath10 functional coefficient , @xmath42 intercept , and @xmath43 residual errors . for non - gaussian responses ,",
    "many have worked with the generalized flm ( gflm ) , first introduced by marx and eilers ( 1999 ) for exponential family responses as @xmath44 for some link function @xmath45 .",
    "ramsay & silverman ( 1997 , section 10.4 ; 2005 , section 15.3 ) discussed using truncated basis function expansions for @xmath46 and @xmath47 . if we let @xmath48'$ ] , @xmath49'$ ] , @xmath50'$ ] , and @xmath51'$ ] , then the functional regression terms can be written @xmath52 if the same orthogonal basis functions are used for $ \\bphi$ and $ \\bpsi$ , then $ j_{\\phi,\\psi}=i$ and $ \\bx_i^{**}=\\bx_i^*$. [ 2 ] if all $ x_i(t)$ are observed on the same regular grid $ \\bt$ of size $ t$ , then one can write $ j_{\\phi , \\psi}=\\bphi \\bpsi'$ , where $ \\bphi=[\\bphi(t_1 ) , \\ldots , \\bphi(t_t)]$ and $ \\bpsi=[\\bpsi(t_1 ) , \\ldots , \\bpsi(t_t)]$.    as discussed in section \\ref{sec : basis } , regularization can be done in the basis space either through truncation , roughness penalties , or sparsity .   for functional predictor regression , this regularization can be applied to the functional coefficients $ b(t)$ and/or predictors $ x_i(t)$.   the regularization of $ b(t)$ accomplishes several purposes : [ 1 ] reduces collinearity in the regression fit , [ 2 ] increases interpretability of coefficient estimates , [ 3 ] potentially increases estimation and prediction efficiency by making use of the functional nature of the data to borrow strength across $ t$.   best choice of basis and regularization strategy is likely to vary across data sets , depending on the characteristics of the functions and the true functional coefficient .",
    "the use of basis functions and regularization across $ x_i(t)$ has two potential purposes : [ 1 ] reduce measurement error in predictors $ x_i(t)$ , which for gaussian responses increases estimation efficiency and for nonlinear models involving non - gaussian outcomes reduces measurement - error - induced bias ( carroll et al . 1995 ) , and [ 2 ] accommodate functional predictors with sparse and/or irregular grids that vary across sampled functions .           most existing methodological development in functional predictor regression",

    "they are also involved in _ regularization _ , since within - function covariance assumptions for each level of random effect functions define how strength is borrowed within a function which impacts estimation and inference of the functional coefficients .",
    "these are the type of random effect functions in model ( [ eq : fmm1 ] ) . in classic linear mixed effect models , random effects are integrated out and fixed effects are estimated using marginal likelihood , leading to a wls - like fitting procedure that re - weights the observations according to the covariance structure induced by the random effects . as a result ,",

    "there is no integration over these sources of variability in estimation and inference of the fixed effect functions .",
    "thus , these _ conditional random effect functions _ behave much like fixed effect functions , providing smoothed estimates for specific individuals but not allowing inference on the the fixed functional regression coefficients to cover the reference population from which they were drawn .",

    "<S> functional data analysis ( fda ) involves the analysis of data whose ideal units of observation are functions defined on some continuous domain , and the observed data consist of a sample of functions taken from some population , sampled on a discrete grid . </S>",
    "<S> ramsay and silverman s 1997 textbook sparked the development of this field , which has accelerated in the past 10 years to become one of the fastest growing areas of statistics , fueled by the growing number of applications yielding this type of data . </S>",
    "<S> one unique characteristic of fda is the need to combine information both across and within functions , which ramsay and silverman called replication and regularization , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this article will focus on functional regression , the area of fda that has received the most attention in applications and methodological development . </S>",
    "<S> first will be an introduction to basis functions , key building blocks for regularization in functional regression methods , followed by an overview of functional regression methods , split into three types : [ 1 ] functional predictor regression ( scalar - on - function ) , [ 2 ] functional response regression ( function - on - scalar ) and [ 3 ] function - on - function regression . </S>",
    "<S> for each , the role of replication and regularization will be discussed and the methodological development described in a roughly chronological manner , at times deviating from the historical timeline to group together similar methods . </S>",
    "<S> the primary focus is on modeling and methodology , highlighting the modeling structures that have been developed and the various regularization approaches employed . at the end is a brief discussion describing potential areas of future development in this field .    </S>",
