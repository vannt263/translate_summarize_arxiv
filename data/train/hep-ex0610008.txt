    "inclusive decay rates of charm mesons into mesons with large @xmath0 inherent quark content , the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons , are important for studies of both charm and @xmath11 decays .",
    "non - strange @xmath12 mesons are generally expected not to decay into such objects , while the @xmath8 is likely to have both @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks present after the primary @xmath15 transition , resulting in many more such particles .",
    "this is particularly useful in distinguishing between @xmath16 and @xmath9 mesons as the @xmath16 decays into @xmath12 s with a large rate of @xmath1790% , while the decays into @xmath8 are at the @xmath1710% level .",
    "we expect that the reverse is true for @xmath9 mesons .",
    "knowledge of the charm yields into these mesons would allow alternative analyses of @xmath9 rates at the @xmath10 or at hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "in this analysis we use 281 pb@xmath6 integrated luminosity of cleo - c data produced in @xmath18 collisions and recorded at the peak of the @xmath19 resonance ( 3.770 gev ) to study the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 yields in @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays .",
    "production in @xmath8 decays is studied at 4170 mev , where the cross - section for @xmath20 is @xmath171 nb @xcite .",
    "the cleo - c detector is equipped to measure the momenta and directions of charged particles , identify charged hadrons , detect photons , and determine with good precision their directions and energies .",
    "it has been described in more detail previously @xcite .",
    "fully reconstructed charged or neutral @xmath12 meson candidates are selected from the data at 3.770 gev , where pairs of @xmath23 or @xmath24 mesons are produced .",
    "the decay modes used are listed in table  [ tab : d0dprecon ] . in general , in this paper",
    ", @xmath12 refers to either a @xmath4 or @xmath5 meson and its anti - particle , and @xmath25 refers to @xmath8 meson and its anti - particle .",
    "( also , mention of a flavor specific state also implies use of the charge - conjugate state . )",
    ".tagging modes and numbers of signal and background events determined from the fits to the @xmath21 and @xmath26 beam constrained mass distributions , after making the mode - dependant @xmath27 cuts .",
    "the error on the summed signal yield is obtained by adding the errors on the individual yields in quadrature . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the large asymmetry in the yields of these particles between @xmath25 and the lighter @xmath12 mesons will permit further studies of @xmath9 decays at the @xmath28(5s ) , and will be most useful for separating @xmath9 from @xmath16 decays at hadron colliders .",
