    "we will describe the nature of the various primordial perturbations and give the corresponding spectra , without deriving them from quantum field theoretical arguments .",

    "we will then compute the corresponding angular power spectra of temperature anisotropies in the cmb .",

    "a few percent change in @xmath2 could lead to an almost flat universe or a wide open one .",
    "this simple picture could be realized in the context of a single - field scalar potential  @xcite or in multiple - field potentials  @xcite , as long as there exists a false vacuum during which the universe becomes homogeneous and then one of the fields tunnels to the true vacuum , creating a single isolated bubble .",

    "although single - field models can in principle be constructed , they require a certain amount of fine tuning in order to avoid tunneling via the hawking - moss instanton  @xcite .",

    "for that reason , it seems more natural to consider multiple - field models of open inflation  @xcite , where one field does the tunneling , another drives slow - roll inflation inside the bubble , and yet another may end inflation , like in the open hybrid model  @xcite .",
    "such models account for the large scale homogeneity observed by cobe  @xcite and are also consistent with recent determinations of a low density parameter  @xcite .",

    "the reason is that the quantum tunneling responsible for the nucleation of the bubble does not occur simultaneously along both field directions and equal - time hypersurfaces in the open universe are not synchronized with equal - density or fixed - field hypersurfaces  @xcite .",
