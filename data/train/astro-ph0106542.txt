    "discrepancies between the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model and observations on galactic scales @xcite have led to recent revival of the suggestion that the dark matter is self - interacting @xcite .",
    "simulations of halo formation in a cdm universe predict that dark matter halos have a cuspy inner profile .",
    "most simulations find that , at small radii , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 to @xmath9 . an inner density profile this steep may be consistent with the dark matter density profile inferred from many high surface brightness galaxies and clusters of galaxies ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "however , low surface brightness galaxies , and dwarf irregular galaxies in particular , require an inner density profile which is less steep ( @xcite ; for a contradictory view see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite have emphasized that too much dark matter in the centers of galaxies is incompatible with rotating bars , which are common in massive galaxies such as the milky way .",
    "a separate problem for standard cdm model is that it predicts many more dark matter satellites of a milky way - sized galaxy than are observed @xcite .",
    "this substructure can not simply be dark satellites in which stars have not formed , because they would thicken the disk of the milky way as they passed through the plane of the disk .",
    "while it is possible that the inclusion of baryonic physics would lead to a less cuspy dark matter halo , perhaps due to supernova driven gas outflow in dwarf galaxies @xcite , this seems unlikely , as cooling baryons would lead to further concentration of the dark matter halo through adiabatic compression .",
    "exploding gaseous disks will drive a strong wind off the plane , but most simulations show that the cold , dense component of a multi - phase medium would be difficult to remove @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these solutions to the cusp problem does not address the problem of too much substructure on small scales .",
    "recent attention has focused instead on the possibility that the dark matter is self - interacting . a remarkable number of different models have been proposed . for example , several authors have considered a model in which the dark matter is a self - interacting scalar field with quartic potential @xcite . @xcite",
    "have suggested a model in which cores are produced in dwarf galaxies due to the wave nature of dark matter , if the matter is an ultra - light scalar particle .",
    "another interacting dark matter candidate is q - balls , non - topological solitons with properties that allow it to scatter , possibly with a time - dependent cross - section , or to merge @xcite .",
    "several authors have simulated halo evolution and formation in scenarios in which the dark matter scatters .",
    "all authors agree that on short time scales , scattering reduces the logarithmic slope of the inner density profile substantially ; some authors have found that the inner density profile subsequently steepens as the halo undergoes core collapse @xcite , while others disagree @xcite .",
    "self - annihilating dark matter is another possible solution to the problem @xcite , although the particle physics must be carefully contrived so that the dark matter does not completely self - annihilate in the early universe .",
    "an analytic calculation of the density of a self - annihilating dark matter halo demonstrates the formation of a core .",
    "physically , the core develops because annihilation becomes very efficient at removing mass from the halo above a density that depends on the annihilation cross section .",
    "@xcite point out that this annihilation also causes an adiabatic expansion of the halo , and numerically calculate the effects of adiabatic expansion ; the core density including expansion is smaller than that predicted from annihilation alone by a factor of ten ( for dwarf galaxies ) to three ( for clusters ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite points out that unitarity bounds require that annihilation be accompanied by scattering .    in this paper",
    ", we simulate the behavior of an isolated dark matter halo which undergoes both scattering and annihilation . in section [ sec : dmmodel ] , we describe our dark matter model and our simulation methods . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results of our simulations , and in section [ sec : conc ] we compare our results with those of previous authors .",
    "we simulated the evolution of an isolated halo ; the initial density profile is the @xcite profile , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total mass of the halo , and @xmath12 is the scale radius .",
    "we take the dynamical time for this model to be the circular orbit time at the scale radius @xmath12 , @xmath13 in the simulations below , we work in units in which @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the profile has been generated to guarantee that the center of mass of the halo is also the origin used in calculating the density of the hernquist profile .",
    "we first choose the energy for each particle , then select a radius for the particle ; these determine the magnitude of the velocity of the particle .",
    "we adopt an isotropic velocity distribution . for each particle generated with position @xmath17 ,",
    "a second particle is generated with position @xmath18 ; the second particle has the same energy as the first .",
    "the distribution is truncated at a radius of 100@xmath12 .",
    "the direction of the velocity of each particle is generated independently , but the net velocity of the halo is set to zero .",
    "we adopt a model similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "the probability for interaction for a particle which moves a distance @xmath19 in time step @xmath20 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mean free path for interactions ; this expression is valid only when @xmath23 .",
    "our simulations include both scattering and annihilation .",
    "we use the notation @xmath24 to denote the annihilation cross section per unit mass and @xmath25 to denote the scattering cross section per unit mass .    the probability that a _ pair _ of particles scatters in time step @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the local density , and @xmath29 is the _ relative _ velocity of particles @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "scattering is completely elastic , and is isotropic in the center of momentum frame of the pair of particles .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , only @xmath32-wave annihilation is consistent with observations . for @xmath32-wave annihilation",
    ", @xmath33 is independent of velocity , so that the cross section for annihilation per unit mass , @xmath34 , is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is determined by the scattering potential .",
    "the numerical value we assume for the scattering cross section is given below .",
    "the probability for an annihilation interaction in time step @xmath26 is : @xmath37 where @xmath28 is the local density .",
    "the annihilation probability is independent of velocity .",
    "we model the decay of the dark matter particles represented by our simulation particles by assigning to each simulation particle a probability for annihilation given by equation ( [ eq : prob - ann ] ) . if the local density is large enough , @xmath38 is the probability that some of the dark matter particles represented by the simulation particle would interact and decay .",
    "if a simulation particle decays , its mass @xmath39 is reduced by fraction @xmath40 , @xmath41 thus , the effective probability for annihilation of individual dark matter particles in our model is the product @xmath42 .",
    "the mass lost in an annihilation is a pre - set fraction of the current mass of the particle undergoing annihilation . in other words ,",
    "the _ fractional _ mass lost in an annihilation is held fixed .",
    "the absolute mass loss , @xmath43 , decreases as a particle undergoing repeated annihilation loses mass .",
    "our simulations were run on a grape3-af special purpose hardware card @xcite using a direct summation code .",
    "the time step was chosen to be small enough to satisfy both the courant condition and to ensure that @xmath44 .",
    "each run contained 30,000 particles .",
    "detailed numerical parameters for each run are shown in table [ table : num - params ] .",
    "runs s0a0 , s3a0 , and s3a1  ran for roughly 10 dynamical times with approximately 2100 steps per dynamical time ; a fourth run , s.3a.1 , was done with a much larger plummer softening and time step ; it ran for 100 dynamical times with approximately 400 steps per dynamical time .",
    ".simulation parameters[table : num - params ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     one run , s0a0 , had no interactions , and was used to determine the stability of the integration .",
    "the run s3a0  had no annihilations , but non - zero scattering cross - section .",
    "two runs with annihilation and scattering were performed .",
    "one , s3a1 , was short ( the final time was a tenth of a hubble time assuming a 10@xmath3m@xmath4 halo ) , but had the same scattering cross - section as the scattering - only run . the other , s.3a.1 , ran for ten times longer , with both annihilation and scattering cross section reduced by a factor of ten . in both annihilation",
    "runs the scattering and annihilation _ probabilities _ are equal at the scale radius ; inside of that radius scattering will be enhanced relative to annihilation because the scattering probability increases with velocity .",
    "the fractional mass loss per annihilation in both was @xmath45 .",
    "the cross section per unit mass for scattering can be calculated in physical units from @xmath46 the cross - section for annihilation is given by @xmath47 for @xmath48  kpc and @xmath49m@xmath50 , the half mass dynamical time is .168  gyr .",
    "our cross - sections are @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the run s3a1 ; in the run s.3a.1 , both cross sections are a factor of ten smaller .",
    "our values of @xmath53  span the range suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered a broader range of values for @xmath53 ; our choice for our runs with the largest scattering cross section is in the middle of their range .    in both annihilating runs",
    ", we chose our annihilation cross section to be comparable to the scattering cross section .",
    "however , this annihilation cross section in the run s3a1  is about 300 times larger than that suggested by @xcite based on fits of rotation curves to dwarf galaxies .",
    "the run s.3a.1 , with an annihilation cross section ten times smaller , is closer to what they suggest . with a mass loss factor @xmath40 of 5% ,",
    "the effective cross section @xmath54 is comparable to the value required to match observations . in both cases ,",
    "the scattering cross section is above the minimum required by unitarity bounds @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of annihilation in our simulations causes a reduction in the central density of the halo .",
    "figure [ fig : dens - annihil ] shows the evolution in the density profile of a halo with both annihilation and scattering ; the top panel shows a short run with high cross section ( s3a1 ) , and the bottom a run with smaller cross section run for longer time ( s.3a.1 ) .",
    "the central density rapidly decreases , and remains low for the duration of the simulations , about 100 ( 10 ) dynamical times for run s.3a.1  ( s3a1 ) .",
    "the core is not due to numerical effects .",
    "the force softening is .05 ( .01 ) in the run s.3a.1  ( s3a1 ) ; the flattening of the inner density profile we observe occurs at radii 210 ( 1050 ) times larger than that and is unlikely to have been caused by softening . to test the stability of our code and the effects of our relatively limited particle number , we ran a simulation with no interactions for ten dynamical times .",
    "the simulation with no interactions s0a0  shows no evidence of the development of a core .",
    "the density profile of the halo was essentially unchanged over the course of the simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : dens - annihil ] shows the beginning profile and the final profile for this run .",
    "we have examined the mechanism by which the core forms in our interaction simulations .",
    "there are three related mechanisms one might imagine contributing to the development of a core .",
    "first , mass lost due to annihilation and the disappearance of the relativistic decay products from the halo directly decreases the central density of the halo .",
    "second , this direct mass loss reduces the gravitational potential of the halo , causing particles in the central region to become less bound .",
    "third , energy is transferred from the central region of the halo outward by scattering , depressing the central density .",
    "although scattering at first suppresses the central density , core collapse begins fairly rapidly in halos with scattering only , as reported by @xcite .",
    "we have run one simulation with scattering alone to determine whether the core that initially forms persists .",
    "the results of this run are shown in figure [ fig : scatt - dens ] .",
    "the central density initially drops and then increases after a few dynamical times . in the absence of annihilation",
    ", scattering does not produce a persistent core in simulations of _ isolated _ halos .",
    "it is unclear whether or not cores persist in high resolution simulations of halo formation in a cosmological setting @xcite .    in order to differentiate between direct mass loss from annihilation and a change in the density profile due to a change in gravitational potential",
    ", we calculate the change in number density of simulation particles as a function of radius .",
    "if direct mass loss due to annihilation is causing most of the decline seen in the density profile , the number density profile ought to be unchanged , with particles in the central region of the halo simply becoming less massive . instead , as can be seen in figure [ fig : num - dens - change ] , which shows the evolution in the number density of particles early in the simulation , we find that the number density rapidly diminishes in the center of the halo , indicating that much of the change in central density is due to the motion of particles away from the center , not from direct mass loss .",
    "the trend of particle number density decreasing in the center continues throughout the simulation , as can be seen from figure [ fig : dens - annihil ] .",
    "density profiles are calculated with a fixed number of particles per bin , so the location of the first point in the density profile is a radius that encloses a fixed number of particles ; this point moves farther from the origin throughout the simulation .",
    "furthermore , the total mass lost by the halo over the entire simulation is only 12% of the initial halo mass .",
    "the halo in the annihilating model forms a core very rapidly , and the size of the core continues to grow over the course of the simulation .",
    "we fit two different functional forms to the density profile of the halo .",
    "one is a modification of the initial hernquist profile [ eq : hern - prof ] to allow for a core , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the core radius in units of the scale radius .",
    "the other density profile was derived by @xcite ; their profile takes into account modifications of the initial halo density profile due to direct annihilation only , without scattering .",
    "adiabatic expansion of the core as mass is lost decreases the core density .",
    "we have derived the profile appropriate for an initial hernquist model , @xmath58 ( note that @xmath59 is related to the annihilation cross section in kaplinghat s model ( eq . [ eq : kapl - core - rad ] ) ; in doing our fits we have treated @xmath59 as a free parameter to see how well the shape of the density profile is fit by the function ) .",
    "fits to both functions are shown at four different epochs in figure [ fig : halo - fits ] .",
    "the two profiles differ only in the innermost region of the halo . @xcite",
    "found that dwarf galaxies are well fit by the profile @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the central density of the halo , and @xmath62 its core radius .",
    "we do not expect the burkert profile to be a good fit to our halo because the initial halo profile has both a different radial dependence at large radii , and a length scale ( the scale radius ) in the initial conditions separate from the core radius .",
    "the halo shows a clear evolution from a kaplinghat profile to a modified hernquist profile . at early times , the kaplinghat model is a better fit than the modified hernquist model . at later times , the modified hernquist model is a better fit .",
    "this is good news , because the modified hernquist profile is closer in form to the burkert profile .",
    "the evolution in profile shape makes sense ; early in the simulation the adiabatic effect of annihilation on the gravitational potential will be small , and the kaplinghat profile should be a good fit .",
    "the core radius in the modified hernquist profile continues to grow throughout the simulation , as shown in figure [ fig : core - rad - growth ] .",
    "the final core radius is 3  kpc , in the range suggested by @xcite for a halo of the mass we studied .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that annihilation produce cores of radius a few kiloparsecs in dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies ; we now discuss whether this dark matter model preserves the successes of non - interacting cdm , the extent to which it addresses the problem of too much substructure in galactic dark matter halos , and the plausibility of the particle physics of the model .",
    "there is little evidence for cores in clusters ; for an annihilation model to be plausible it must modify small scale behavior of dark matter while leaving large scale behavior unchanged . in the analytic model of @xcite ,",
    "the core radius grows linearly in time , and is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the characteristic density of the nfw profile and @xmath65 is the age of the halo . since lower mass halos have higher density , and formed earlier , than high mass halos , one would expect a decreasing core radius with increasing mass .",
    "figure [ fig : core - mass - depend ] shows the trend of core radius with mass , assuming the core radius is given by equation ( [ eq : kapl - core - rad ] ) ; the core radius has been normalized to that of a @xmath66 halo ( approximately 3  kpc ) to eliminate the dependence of the core radius on cross section .",
    "characteristic densities and halo ages were calculated using the @xcite model , assuming a @xmath67 , @xmath68 flat cosmology with @xmath69 .",
    "most of the decrease in core radius is due to the decrease in characteristic density as mass increases ; the age difference of the lowest and highest mass halo accounts for only 20% of the difference in core radius .",
    "our model clearly creates large cores in low mass / high density halos without producing them in high mass / low density halos .",
    "thus if the annihilations lead to a core radius of 3  kpc for dwarf galaxies , as appropriate , the predicted dark matter core radius in rich clusters would be @xmath70  pc , which is deep within the central galaxy .",
    "the core structure of the dark matter halo of a high surface brightness galaxies is unclear .",
    "@xcite argue that the concentrations of dark matter halos predicted in the standard @xmath71cdm  model are consistent with both the tully - fisher relationship and the amount of dark matter interior to the solar radius . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argues that detailed mass modeling of the barred spiral ngc 4123 requires either a modest core in the dark matter halo , with a core radius of 16  kpc , or an nfw profile with very low concentration . arguing more generally , @xcite find that a high density dark matter halo in a barred galaxy leads to rapid slowing of bar rotation . for the same choice of annihilation cross - section that generates a 3  kpc core in dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the core radius in a @xmath72  m@xmath6 galaxy such as the milky way would be @xmath73  kpc , and would resolve the difficulties of bar spirals in standard @xmath71cdm  discussed by @xcite .",
    "the standard @xmath71cdm  model also predicts more substructure on galactic scales than is observed @xcite .",
    "although the simulations we have done can not directly address the question of substructure , figure [ fig : core - mass - depend ] can be extended to low mass halos . as halo mass shrinks , the core radius increases while the virial radius increases .",
    "the two are equal for halos of mass 3@xmath74m@xmath4 ; halos with mass @xmath75 solar masses have a core radius that is half the virial radius .",
    "this suggests that halos smaller than a few times @xmath75 solar masses would not be present in an annihilating dark matter model .",
    "further simulation of structure formation in a cosmological context with annihilating dark matter would be helpful .",
    "one of the problems with earlier self - interacting dark matter proposals @xcite is that ram pressure stripping will destroy small halos too efficiently @xcite .",
    "newer models in which the dark matter behaves like a viscosity - free fluid @xcite avoid this problem , but may overly - suppress the growth of structure on small scales in the linear regime @xcite , a problem shared by the earlier self - interacting dark matter models @xcite .",
    "the model proposed by @xcite has some similarities to our model .",
    "they investigated the properties of dark matter that self - annihilated ( that is , interactions occurred in which the annihilation products were the dark matter particles ) .",
    "their model affects the structure of halos by heating dense regions , and affects fluctuations in the early universe through the introduction of a non - trivial jean s length for the dark matter .",
    "our model differs in that we assume the dark matter annihilates to something relativistic that no longer contributes to the gravitational potential of a halo after annihilation .",
    "this should lead to a greater effect on the core properties of the halo , through adiabatic changes to the gravitational potential , than the model of @xcite .",
    "the interacting dark matter model proposed by @xcite is constructed so as to avoid excessive suppression of the power spectrum on small scales .",
    "the dark matter is presumed to be cold , and the interaction cross sections are small enough that the probability of interaction is small at the time of recombination .",
    "there are additional problems with an annihilating dark matter model .",
    "first , the amount of energy released in dark matter annihilation is tremendous ; in our simulation of a single halo , the mass loss from annihilation ( in whatever the decay products are ) has an energy equivalent of @xmath76  erg  s@xmath1 averaged over the lifetime of the universe .",
    "this is far too large to be consistent with observations of the gamma ray background .",
    "if the dark matter annihilates , the decay products can not include photons .",
    "second , as discussed at length by @xcite , the particle physics underlying an annihilating dark matter model must be carefully contrived so as to avoid complete annihilation of the dark matter in the early universe .",
    "the suppression of annihilation must be in place for @xmath77 , which is a rather low energy for any reasonable phase transitions in the dark matter sector .",
    "annihilating dark matter leads to halo density profiles consistent with those observed in dwarf spiral galaxies .",
    "annihilation leads to a rapid reduction in the central density of a dark matter halo , driven mainly by adiabatic expansion of the core region as matter is lost .",
    "an annihilation cross section sufficient to generate a core in a dwarf galaxy halo generates a moderate core in a milky way sized halo , and a negligible core in a rich cluster .",
    "the core radius decreases rapidly with halo mass , primarily because larger objects form later in hierarchical clustering models , when the mean density of the universe is lower .",
    "objects smaller than @xmath78m@xmath6 are unlikely to be present in an annihilating dark matter model , because the core radius will be large compared to the virial radius .",
    "a reduction in structure on this scale would be useful ; cdm predicts many more halos of this size than are observed .    on the other hand",
    ", there is no compelling motivation for such a complex dark matter candidate .",
    "a special mechanism is needed to suppress annihilation of the dark matter in the early universe , and the dark matter must decay to particles that do not interact with ordinary matter .",
    "although a particle physics model with the required properties could no doubt be constructed , such a model would be contrived .    further study of the impact of annihilation in a cosmological setting would be useful in evaluating the promise of this model .",
