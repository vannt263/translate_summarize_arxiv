    "the properties of spin glasses in a magnetic field have been the subject of considerable attention .",
    "it is widely recognized that the parisi replica - symmetry breaking ansatz @xcite provides an essentially correct mean - field solution for the infinite - range sherrington - kirkpatrick model .",
    "@xcite the spin - glass phase in this model is separated from the paramagnetic phase in the @xmath5 plane by the de almeida - thouless ( at ) critical line .",
    "@xcite the situation is less clear in the case of finite - dimensional short - range models .",
    "rigorous theoretical results show viability of the mean - field approach for the description of these systems , @xcite but progress is impeded by significant analytical difficulties .",
    "numerical studies have repeatedly suggested the existence of an at - type critical line at @xmath6 and higher dimensions .",
    "@xcite however , magnetic field effects present a difficult challenge for computer simulations . finite size , and difficulties in equilibrating large samples , do not yet allow a clear distinction between the mean - field picture and the droplet scenario .",
    "@xcite because of this , the existence of the spin - glass phase transition in a magnetic field is considered a most relevant open problem.@xcite    the experimental evidence for an at - type critical behavior appears ambiguous .",
    "many real spin glasses have mean - field - like phase diagrams , @xcite with an onset of strong @xmath7 irreversibility along a certain line .",
    "this irreversibility is usually interpreted as a sign of replica - symmetry breaking . however , real spin glasses are always out of equilibrium , and the measured at lines are time dependent .",
    "therefore , it appears impossible to obtain information about the _ equilibrium _",
    "phase diagram directly from experiments .",
    "we show in this paper , however , that the study of magnetic field effects on the _ nonequilibrium _ dynamics of spin glasses can shed light on the magnetic properties of the equilibrium spin - glass state .",
    "our motivation for this work is twofold .",
    "first , effects of magnetic field are understood fairly well within the mean - field theory , where they are derived from first principles .",
    "the minimum possible overlap , @xmath8 , of two states in the presence of a magnetic magnetic field , @xmath9 , plays an important role in this approach . yet , as usually happens in spin - glass physics , the theoretical predictions can not be easily related to experimentally observable phenomena .",
    "even those models of spin - glass dynamics that are based on the mean - field - like hierarchical picture of phase space tend to treat magnetic field effects phenomenologically in terms of the zeeman energy . in this paper",
    ", we show that experimental results on the magnetic field dependence of spin - glass dynamics are consistent with the mean - field description .",
    "the second reason for this work is practical .",
    "spin - glass relaxation properties are usually studied under a change in magnetic field .",
    "it is often believed that the subsequent response is linear in magnetic field `` for reasonably small field values ( say @xmath10 ) '' .",
    "@xcite we show in this paper that the very definition of what one means by `` reasonably small '' fields is impossible without knowledge of the spin - glass phase diagram .",
    "this knowledge becomes vital when results for different temperatures or different samples are compared .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section describes a theoretical picture underlying our analysis .",
    "iii.a presents results of magnetization measurements .",
    "iii.b is devoted to experimental results for the effective waiting time . in sec .",
    "iii.c , the waiting - time dependence of the measured quantities is discussed in detail .",
    "iv summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the main obstacle to an experimental test of mean - field - theory predictions is the problem of relating experimentally accessible spin - glass dynamics to the static equilibrium properties of the spin - glass state , described by the parisi solution .",
    "phenomenological phase - space models have provided important insights into possible physical mechanisms for spin - glass relaxation.@xcite a recent theoretical breakthrough has been achieved within the mean - field theory of aging phenomena , proposed by cugliandolo _",
    "et al_. @xcite because these theoretical developments have profound significance for the interpretation of our experimental results , we shall briefly review them here .",
    "the well - known fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite establishes a link between the linear response of a system to an external perturbation , and the fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the response of a spin system at time @xmath11 to an instantaneous field at time @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the spin autocorrelation function , @xmath14 , are defined as follows : @xmath15 @xmath16 in thermodynamic equilibrium , both functions are time - translation invariant , and related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 the violation of this theorem in a general off - equilibrium situation is described by the function @xmath19 : @xcite @xmath20 violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is associated with a deviation from linear response .",
    "a second - order nonlinearity does not appear because the magnetization changes sign when the field is reversed .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the presence of a third - order nonlinear response turns the fluctuation - dissipation theorem into a fluctuation - dissipation inequality .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is generally less than unity .",
    "when these formulas are applied to spin - glass dynamics , the relevant times are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the waiting time and observation time after the waiting time , respectively .",
    "the dynamical quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be related to their equilibrium counterparts if both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are sent to infinity . however , time - translational invariance does not hold off equilibrium , and the limiting values depend on how the limits are taken",
    ". one can write for the correlation function , @xcite @xmath28 and @xmath29 eq .",
    "( 5 ) is a dynamical definition of the edwards - anderson order parameter , @xmath30 , as the value of the correlation function at the limit of validity of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "( 6 ) expresses the property of weak ergodicity breaking in spin glasses .",
    "if the waiting time is finite and the magnetic field is zero ( giving @xmath31 ) , the system is able to escape arbitrarily far from the configuration it had reached at @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite    the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath33 is defined as the limit of the function @xmath21 , taken along a path in the @xmath34 plane , characterized by a given value @xmath35 of the correlation function @xmath14.@xcite the most important result of the theory is the fact that , under the assumption of stochastic stability,@xcite @xmath33 is equal to the equilibrium order parameter function @xmath36 : @xmath37 the function @xmath36 is an integral of the parisi order parameter @xmath38,@xcite which can be introduced for short - range spin glasses within the standard replica - symmetry breaking formalism .",
    "@xcite according to eq .",
    "( 7 ) , there is a deep relationship between spin - glass dynamics and the static equilibrium properties of the spin - glass state .",
    "it implies that `` in any finite - dimensional system , replica - symmetry breaking and aging in the response functions either appear together or do not appear at all '' .",
    "we now consider the physical ( experimental ) significance of these theoretical results .",
    "it is well known that there are two main regimes of spin - glass relaxation . in the equilibrium , or stationary regime , observation times @xmath39 , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds and the response function depends only on @xmath25 . in the nonequilibrium , or aging regime , observation times @xmath40 , the fdt is violated and the relaxation depends on @xmath24 for any @xmath25 .",
    "both regimes have been observed experimentally @xcite and studied numerically.@xcite the transition from one regime to the other is marked by a peak in the relaxation rate , corresponding to strong violation of fdt at @xmath41 .",
    "these effects can be naturally explained within the mean - field theory of aging phenomena .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the function @xmath21 , introduced to describe violations of the fdt in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , depends on its time arguments only through the correlation function : @xmath42 $ ] . in the equilibrium regime ,",
    "the correlation function decreases rapidly ( on the linear time scale ) from 1 to @xmath30 , and @xmath43 . in the aging regime",
    ", the correlation function relaxes slowly from @xmath30 to @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite the transition from one regime to the other is a direct consequence of replica - symmetry breaking at @xmath46 .",
    "another important issue is the chaotic nature of the spin glass state with respect to magnetic field .",
    "it has been demonstrated numerically that a small change in external field leads to a considerable reorganization of a spin configuration.@xcite the parisi solution suggests that an average equilibrium overlap between two states at different but similar magnetic fields , @xmath47,@xcite is equal to @xmath44 , i.e. the minimum possible overlap.@xcite analysis of fluctuations around the parisi solution , carried out by kondor,@xcite demonstrates that the correlation overlap function @xmath48 for two spins , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , at a distance @xmath51 , behaves as @xmath52 this means that the projection of the correlation @xmath53 at field @xmath9 onto the correlation @xmath54 at zero field vanishes beyond the finite characteristic length @xmath55 . near @xmath56 and at low fields , this magnetic correlation length is simply @xmath57 . in the mean - field theory , @xmath58 , so that @xmath55 diverges rapidly as the field goes to zero .",
    "the behavior of the correlation function , eq .  ( 8) , is a consequence of replica - symmetry breaking .",
    "the low - temperature spin - glass phase has an essentially infinite number of pure equilibrium states .",
    "each of them is characterized by an infinite correlation length .",
    "these states have equal free energies per site , except for differences of the order @xmath59 .",
    "only a few states with the lowest energies contribute significantly to the partition function . because of the small energy differences , any small ( but finite ) amount of energy , added to the system , is enough to reshuffle the boltzmann weights of the different states and thus completely reorganize the equilibrium spin configuration .",
    "application of a magnetic field is an example of such a perturbation .",
    "the magnetic correlation length , @xmath55 , has the following meaning.@xcite when a magnetic field @xmath9 is applied to the system , the minimum possible overlap of two states is equal to @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , all the states having overlaps @xmath60 are suppressed by the field .",
    "their free energies increase , and they acquire the finite correlation length @xmath55 .",
    "the spatial spin correlations , corresponding to these states , survive only within this range .",
    "all the other pure states are still characterized by an infinite correlation length . at the at line , where @xmath61 , all the states have a finite correlation length , and",
    "the system becomes paramagnetic .",
    "thus , a change in magnetic field has a randomizing effect on the spin - glass state .",
    "the ratio @xmath62 is a natural measure of this effect .",
    "the chaotic nature of the spin - glass state is also reflected in the phenomenological droplet model .",
    "the magnetic correlation length is determined as an average droplet size for which the zeeman energy is equal to the energy of the droplet excitation .",
    "it is given by the following expression:@xcite @xmath63 even though this result , with @xmath6 and @xmath64 , is similar to the result of the mean - field theory , the physics is quite different .",
    "spin - glass properties in this model are governed by low - energy excitations of the ground state , created by coherent flipping of compact clusters of spins .",
    "it is suggested that the magnetic field , @xmath9 , would flip all the droplets with sizes greater than @xmath55 and thus destroy _ all _ spin - glass correlations beyond this length scale .",
    "therefore , at any nonzero field , there is only a paramagnetic state with the finite correlation length @xmath55 .    in both these approaches ,",
    "the chaotic nature of the spin - glass state with respect to magnetic field leads to departures from linear response as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the study of violations of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem as a function of magnetic field change @xmath0 . according to eq .",
    "( 7 ) , aging dynamics of the spin - glass state is ultimately determined by static equilibrium properties .",
    "any violation of the fdt contains information about replica - symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , studies of the gradual deviation from linear response as @xmath0 increases can provide insight into the nature of the spin - glass phase diagram .",
    "direct experimental determination of the correlation function , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , requires sophisticated measurements of the time dependent magnetic noise spectrum.@xcite instead , we make use of quantities which can be obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements .",
    "the first quantity of interest is the difference of the values of remanence , measured in trm and zfc experiments : @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , within the linear regime , this quantity is zero , provided that all three magnetizations are measured at the same time after the initial quench .",
    "the second quantity of interest is the effective waiting time , @xmath2 , defined as the value of the observation time @xmath25 where the relaxation rate @xmath65 has a maximum .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that , within the linear response regime , @xmath66 , so that the peak in @xmath67 is essentially unaffected by a small magnetic field change .",
    "the third quantity we study experimentally is the difference @xmath3 .",
    "it describes a change in the measured magnetization as a result of the waiting time , and thus allows closer examination of aging phenomena .",
    "all experiments were performed on a single crystal of cu : mn 1.5 at % , a typical heisenberg spin glass with a glass temperature of about @xmath68 .",
    "results of conventional studies of the phase diagram for this sample will be reported elsewhere .",
    "a commercial quantum design squid magnetometer was used for all the measurements .",
    "1 exhibits the dependence of @xmath69 , @xmath7 , and their difference , on the field change @xmath0 , measured at @xmath72 .",
    "all data points were taken at the same short observation time , @xmath73 , with zero waiting time , and an effective cooling time of about @xmath74 .",
    "error bars are smaller than the symbol sizes .",
    "the same will apply to all figures without error bars .",
    "1 shows that three different types of spin - glass behavior can be distinguished for different ranges of magnetic field change , @xmath0 . for field changes from @xmath75 to @xmath76 ,",
    "the difference @xmath1 is zero to within our experimental accuracy . between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , there are weak deviations from linear response . at @xmath79 ,",
    "corresponding approximately to the peak in the @xmath7 remanence , violation of linear response becomes strong , and the difference @xmath1 is a linear function of @xmath0 with a large slope .",
    "the temperature dependences of the critical field changes @xmath80 and @xmath81 are presented in fig .  2 and fig .  3 .",
    "the figures also show the critical at line , determined for the same sample at the same observation and cooling times , using the onset of strong @xmath7 irreversibility as the signature of the spin - glass phase transition .",
    "we assume that this dynamical line approximates the equilibrium at line for infinite waiting time . the difference @xmath7 in fig .",
    "1 is not zero at the at field of @xmath82 because transverse freezing above the at line leads to a weak longitudinal irreversibility.@xcite    one sees from fig .",
    "2 that all three lines in the @xmath4 plane have the same functional form , @xmath83 , typical of the equilibrium at critical line @xcite in the sk model .",
    "moreover , the two linear - response violation lines , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , determine dynamical transition temperatures which are very close to the actual glass temperature @xmath56 . it would thus be incorrect to say that the critical at - type line plays a role at high fields only .",
    "our results demonstrate that this line manifests itself dynamically even at very low fields .",
    "a critical field change for a given degree of linear response violation seems to be a constant fraction of the at field .",
    "it means , from a practical point of view , that results obtained at different temperatures can be directly compared only if they have the same @xmath86 ratio .",
    "a comment should be made at this point .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that a @xmath87 dependence for transition lines is not a unique feature of the mean - field theory .",
    "a similar power law could be obtained from purely dynamical considerations without using the concept of the spin - glass phase transition.@xcite a dynamical freezing line , @xmath88 , appears in the droplet model as well.@xcite in the present analysis , we do not rely on the existence of the @xmath89 dependence by itself .",
    "our argument is based on the fact that the experimental at and linear response violation lines have the _ same _ functional form , as illustrated in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "this result suggests that there is a close relationship between the static and dynamic properties of the spin - glass state , assuming that the measured at line is related to the equilibrium one .",
    "of course , measured values of the critical field changes depend on both the waiting time and the observation time .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 where values of @xmath1 are plotted for @xmath90 and @xmath91 . as the waiting time becomes larger , @xmath77 increases ,",
    "while @xmath81 decreases .",
    "thus , longer equilibration times make the system less susceptible to external perturbations , but only up to a certain point .",
    "this issue will be discussed further in sec .",
    "iii.c .",
    "let us now turn to a discussion of the effective waiting time , @xmath2 .",
    "5 exhibits the dependence of @xmath92 on the magnetic field change @xmath93 for three different waiting times : @xmath94 , and 0 .",
    "the temperature is the same as in fig .  1 .",
    "one can easily discern three regimes of fdt violation , corresponding to the three regimes of deviation from linear response seen in fig .  1 .",
    "as the magnetic field change , @xmath0 , increases from zero up to about @xmath95 , the effective waiting time decreases only slightly .",
    "this means that fdt holds for observation times less than @xmath96 .",
    "of course , if the waiting time is short , @xmath2 is determined by the cooling procedure .    in the interval from @xmath95 to about @xmath97 , the effective waiting time drops sharply , and the field dependence of its logarithm is linear . in this case , nonequilibrium behavior appears much earlier , and the fdt holds only at short times @xmath98 .",
    "this corresponds to the weak deviation from linear response between @xmath77 and @xmath81 in fig .  1 .    when the field change exceeds @xmath97 , the fdt is strongly violated .",
    "one can see from fig .  5 that , in this regime , the curves for long waiting times approach the curve for zero waiting time , and the waiting time dependence almost disappears .",
    "this situation corresponds to the strong deviation from linear response at short observation times above @xmath81 in fig .  1 .",
    "therefore , the break from the linear dependence of @xmath92 on @xmath0 , observed at large field changes , is directly related to strong nonlinearity in the spin - glass response . the effective waiting time in this case",
    "is determined primarily by the zero waiting time results , dependent on the experimental protocol .    the waiting time dependence in fig .",
    "5 supports the conclusion , drawn from fig .  4 , that an increase in waiting time leads to an expansion of the linear response region to higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "an increase in the observation time @xmath25 has the opposite effect .",
    "the field dependence is more pronounced at longer times .",
    "this accounts for the fact that the critical field changes , extracted from the effective waiting time experiments ( fig .  5 ) ,",
    "seem to be lower than those obtained from the short - time magnetization measurements ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "another interesting feature of our results is that the dependence of @xmath92 on @xmath0 for @xmath90 , determined exclusively by the cooling procedure , does not exhibit the low - field plateau seen at longer waiting times .",
    "this behavior is analyzed in sec .",
    "the temperature dependence of the effective waiting time is exhibited in fig .",
    "6 and fig .  7 , where @xmath92 vs. @xmath0 data for @xmath91 are plotted for four different temperatures . the results for the smallest field change of @xmath99 are not exactly the same because the effective cooling time increases as the measurement temperature is lowered .",
    "it is quite evident from fig .  7 , however , that the four curves scale rather well together if plotted vs. @xmath100 .",
    "this means that the critical at line sets a characteristic magnetic field scale at any temperature below @xmath56 , and that it plays an important role for _ all _ aspects of spin - glass dynamics .",
    "the waiting time dependences of the characteristic field changes , corresponding to the weak and strong linear response violations , deserve special attention .",
    "our experimental results , exhibited in fig .  4 and fig .",
    "5 , suggest that @xmath77 increases with @xmath24 , while @xmath81 diminishes .    in order to check this conclusion ,",
    "we have measured the field dependence of the thermoremanent magnetization , @xmath101 , for three different waiting times : @xmath94 , and 0 .",
    "the measurement temperature is @xmath72 , and the observation time after the field change is @xmath102 . for convenience",
    ", we shall refer to the zero - waiting - time dependence as @xmath103 .",
    "this nonequilibrium relaxation function is determined by the cooling process and not by the waiting time .",
    "the results are exhibited in fig .",
    "one can see that the maxima in the trm curves shift towards lower fields as the waiting time increases . to examine evolution of the measured magnetization curves due to aging phenomena",
    ", we consider the differences @xmath104 , where both @xmath69 and @xmath105 are measured at the same observation time .",
    "8 suggests that the maxima in @xmath104 correspond to higher fields at longer waiting times .",
    "fig .  9 exhibits the logarithm of the ratio @xmath106 .",
    "two different types of behavior can be clearly distinguished .",
    "the ratio increases as long as the field change is less than about @xmath107 , and decreases at higher @xmath0 . the field dependence of its logarithm can be approximated by straight lines in both regimes .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "9 can be understood if we compare them with the data in fig .",
    "5 . at low field changes ,",
    "the effective waiting time for @xmath105 decreases more steeply with increasing @xmath0 than the effective waiting time for @xmath69 , which has a plateau in this region .",
    "the decay of the @xmath105 becomes faster in time , and the ratio @xmath106 , measured at fixed observation time , increases with @xmath0 . at higher magnetic field",
    "changes the drop in the effective waiting time for the @xmath69 is greater than for the @xmath105 .",
    "as a result , the ratio @xmath106 decreases . according to fig .  9 , the transition from one regime to the other occurs at a higher magnetic field change for a longer waiting time .",
    "this observation supports our conclusion that the plateau in the field dependence of the effective waiting time broadens as the system equilibrates .",
    "10 provides further insight into the nature of this effect .",
    "it displays the same quantity , the logarithm of @xmath108 , as a function of time at constant @xmath109 .",
    "the experimental protocol is the same as before , except for the different waiting times .",
    "one can see a deep similarity between the results in fig .",
    "9 and fig .  10 .",
    "the waiting time dependence exhibited in fig .",
    "10 is readily understandable : the system stays longer in the quasiequilibrium regime for longer @xmath24 , so the maximum in @xmath104 shifts towards longer observation times .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "9 suggests that the same is true for the field dependence : the system in the quasiequilibrium regime can sustain a stronger perturbation for a longer waiting time .",
    "this similarity between the effects of the observation time and of the field change on the spin - glass state is a natural consequence of replica - symmetry breaking .",
    "the weak ergodicity breaking scenario , mentioned in sec .",
    "ii.a , suggests that , as the observation time increases , the system can evolve very far from the state at time @xmath24 , with the minimum correlation set by @xmath44 .",
    "this results from the fact that the average relaxation time is infinite because of the exponential distribution of free energies of different states .",
    "chaotic nature of the spin - glass state with respect to magnetic field , discussed in sec .",
    "ii.b , forces the new equilibrium configuration after a field change to have the minimum overlap @xmath44 with the old configuration .",
    "this phenomenon is also related to existence of an essentially infinite number of states with very similar free energies .",
    "thus , both an increasing observation time and an increasing field change make the spin - glass state less correlated with the state at time @xmath24 .",
    "it is of interest to examine the waiting time dependences of @xmath77 and @xmath81 for the two `` competing '' descriptions of spin - glass dynamics : the droplet model and the phase - space picture .    in the droplet",
    "model,@xcite if @xmath110 is an average droplet size , and @xmath111 is an observation length scale , two limiting cases can be distinguished . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the fdt is violated when @xmath113 , and the field does not play a significant role . for @xmath114 ,",
    "the fdt is violated as soon as @xmath115 , and the waiting time is relatively unimportant .",
    "these regimes correspond approximately to experimental regimes with @xmath116 and @xmath117 , as discussed above .",
    "there is also an intermediate regime with @xmath118 .",
    "this regime is very interesting physically , because violation of the fdt depends on interplay among all three length scales : @xmath119 .",
    "unfortunately , no predictions for this regime are given within the droplet model.@xcite it has been argued@xcite that , if the crossover between linear and nonlinear regimes is defined by a condition @xmath120 , the field change , needed to provoke nonlinear relaxation , should decrease with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "this argument can explain the waiting time dependence of @xmath81 .",
    "however , it fails in the case of @xmath77 , which _ increases _ with @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the experimentally observed waiting time dependence of @xmath77 appears rather counterintuitive within the droplet scenario .",
    "the phase - space picture of spin - glass dynamics does provide a consistent explanation for these phenomena . in this approach , evolution of a system in the phase space",
    "can be viewed as a series of transitions among traps , separated by free - energy barriers .",
    "@xcite as the system equilibrates , it encounters traps with higher barriers , and these traps increasingly resemble the pure states , contributing to equilibrium.@xcite the quasiequilibrium relaxation regime at short observation times corresponds to evolution within each trap , and the subsequent nonequilibrium behavior is related to evolution from trap to trap . as the waiting time ,",
    "@xmath24 , increases , the system has to overcome a higher effective barrier to leave a trap .",
    "this takes a longer time , or ( if the observation time is fixed ) a larger field change .",
    "therefore , the characteristic field change for the weak linear response violation , @xmath77 , increases with @xmath24 .",
    "however , after overcoming a higher barrier , the system can explore a broader free - energy landscape due to hierarchical structure of the phase space .",
    "it takes less time or a smaller field change to produce a state very different from the one at @xmath24 .",
    "the nonequilibrium behavior is thus more affected by external perturbations for longer waiting times .",
    "therefore , the characteristic field change for the strong linear response violation , @xmath81 , decreases with @xmath24 .",
    "the transition from the quasiequilibrium to the nonequilibrium regime is better defined after longer waiting times , both as a function of the observation time and as a function of the field change .",
    "this conclusion agrees with results of numerical simulations , which show the same effect when susceptibility is studied as a function of correlation.@xcite +",
    "the usual method for studying the spin - glass phase diagram is the observation of the @xmath7 irreversibility as a function of temperature at a fixed magnetic field , @xmath121 .",
    "a different approach is employed in the present paper .",
    "the temperature is kept constant and `` irreversibility of the irreversibility '' , @xmath1 , is measured as a function of magnetic field change @xmath0 .",
    "increasing @xmath0 leads to a gradual deviation from linear response , and , equivalently , to a violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "this violation , according to the mean - field theory of aging phenomena , is directly related to replica - symmetry breaking .",
    "our experiments show that both methods give the same functional form for the critical lines , suggesting a mean - field - like phase diagram .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by measurements of the effective waiting time , @xmath2 .",
    "the study of waiting time effects on the linear response violation suggests the validity of the phase - space picture for spin - glass dynamics .",
    "our results demonstrate the existence of a fundamental link between static and dynamic properties of spin glasses , predicted by the mean - field theory of aging phenomena .",
