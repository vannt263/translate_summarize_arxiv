    "the concept of universality near critical points in equilibrium systems has a long history and is theoretically well - developed @xcite . when equilibrium systems undergo second order phase transition at a critical point , they display universal scaling properties for thermodynamic quantities and correlation functions . these are characterized by a set of scaling exponents , which are _ universal _ in the sense that they depend only on the spatial dimension @xmath3 and the symmetry of the order parameter ( e.g. , ising , xy etc . )",
    "@xcite , but not on the parameters that specify the ( bare ) hamiltonian .",
    "notable exceptions are the @xmath4 model and the related models , where the renormalization group flow is characterized by a fixed line and consequently the scaling exponents exhibit a continuous dependence on the value of the bare stiffness parameter that appears in the model hamiltonian .",
    "the idea of universality may be readily extended to equilibrium dynamics close to critical points , where the systems exhibit universality through the dynamic scaling exponents , which characterize the time - dependent unequal - time correlation functions .",
    "their universality classes depend upon the presence or absence of conservation laws and the non - dissipative ( reactive ) terms in the underlying dynamical equations @xcite . for driven dissipative out of equilibrium systems with nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) ,",
    "the general picture about universality is still wide open . in the recent past",
    ", attempts with significant success have been made in classifying the physics of non - equilibrium systems at long time and large length scales into universality classes .",
    "for example , the robustness of the standard universality classes in critical dynamics to detailed - balance violating perturbations are shown in ref .",
    "in addition only models having conserved order parameters and spatially anisotropic noise correlations exhibit novel features .",
    "in contrast , recent works demonstrate that truly non - equilibrium dynamic phenomena , whose steady states can not be described in terms of gibbsian distributions , are rather sensitive to all kinds of perturbations .",
    "well - known examples include driven diffusive models  @xcite , and fluid- and magnetohydrodynamic- turbulence  @xcite .",
    "overall , in contrast to equilibrium systems , how one may classify the universality classes for systems out of equilibrium remains an unresolved issue till the date .",
    "it is well - known that for models driven out of equilibrium , not only dynamical properties but even the static properties ( e.g. , the static correlation functions ) depend crucially on the distributions of noises which appear in a langevin description of the model . in light of this",
    "a useful strategy is to investigate nonequilibrium universality classes is to construct simple models with non - thermal noises , whose dynamics will reveal this sensitive dependence of universal properties on noise distributions in a systematic manner .    in this article",

    "we use field theoretic renormalization group calculation @xcite using dimensional regularization @xcite based on an @xmath9-expansion @xcite scheme .",
    "our principal results are : ( i ) as a temperature - like variable in the model ( see below ) is lowered , our model undergoes a phase transition from a _ high temperature _ paramagnetic disordered phase to a _ low temperature _ ferromagnetic ordered phase undergoing a second order phase transition at a nonequilibrium critical point , ( ii ) universal scaling behavior near the critical point determined by a set of standard scaling exponents characterizing the correlation and the response functions that depend explicitly on the magnitude of the noise cross - correlations ; in effect we obtain a continuous universality parameterized by the noise cross - correlations , the latter being a marginal operator in the model .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we set up our continuum @xmath0 symmetric dynamical model for a non - conserved order parameter to study its universal properties near the critical point .",
    "we introduce noises which break the fluctuation - dissipation - theorem ( fdt ) @xcite , and thus drive the system out of equilibrium , but keep the rotational invariance in the order parameter space unbroken . in the next sec .",
    "[ results ] we set up the field theoretic formulation for our model in terms of a path integral description .",
    "we use a diagrammatic perturbation theory and calculate fluctuations corrections to different vertex functions up to the two - loop order .",
    "we then use a minimal subtraction scheme to calculate different critical exponents within an @xmath9-expansion . in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] we summarize and discuss the implications of our results .",
    "in this section we set up our model equations to describe a simple nonequilibrium generalization of the relaxational ( model a ) dynamics in the overdamped limit of a non - conserved @xmath0 symmetric order parameter .",
    "the equilibrium characteristics of this dynamical model have been extensively discussed in the literature , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we consider a second order phase transition described by a vector order parameter @xmath10 .",
    "as we furthermore assume isotropy in order parameter space , the static critical properties are described by an @xmath0-symmetric @xmath11-type landau - ginzburg - wilson free energy functional in @xmath3 space dimensions , @xmath12=\\int d^dx [ \\frac{\\tau}{2 } ( { \\phi_1}^2 + { \\phi_2}^2 ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\{(\\nabla \\phi_1)^2 + ( \\nabla\\phi_2)^2\\ } + \\frac{u}{4 ! } ( { \\phi_1}^2 + { \\phi_2}^2)^2 ] , \\label{free}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the bare relative distance from the mean - field critical temperature @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a ( bare ) coupling constant .",
    "the free energy functional @xmath16 is manifestly rotation invariant in the order parameter space .",
    "this @xmath16 determines the equilibrium probability distribution for @xmath17 .",
    "free energy functional @xmath16 allows us to compute any of the two ( independent ) critical exponents , e.g. , the anomalous dimension @xmath18 and the correlation length exponent @xmath19 , by means of renormalization group procedure , based on diagrammatic perturbation theory with respect to the static non - linear coupling @xmath20 within a systematic expansion in terms of @xmath21 about the static upper critical dimension @xmath22 .",
    "these exponents have well - defined physical meaning .",
    "for example , the exponent @xmath18 characterizes how the order parameter correlation function at criticality decays in a spatial power - law fashion , @xmath23 , or equivalently of the static susceptibility @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a wavevector , and the exponent @xmath19 describes how the correlation length @xmath26 diverges as the renormalized critical temperature @xmath27 is approached , latexmath:[$\\xi\\propto    temperature @xmath27 is smaller as compared to the mean - field critical temperature @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast to equilibrium systems , for systems out of equilibrium , there is no detailed balance and even the static quantities must be calculated from the underlying dynamics directly .",
    "the description of the dynamics of such systems in terms of continuum degrees of freedom are often based on stochastically driven langevin equations of motion for the relevant dynamical degrees of freedom . for langevin equations describing processes relaxing towards a thermal equilibrium state the correlation functions of a given degree of freedom and the corresponding susceptibility",
    "are connected through the fdt which in turn fixes specific relations between the variances of the noises and the diffusivities .",
    "for example , the non - conserved relaxational ( model a ) dynamics for a vector order parameter @xmath17 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 ; @xmath16 is given by ( [ free ] ) , @xmath33 is a kinetic coefficient and @xmath34 are temporally delta - correlated zero - mean gaussian stochastic noises with specified variances . assuming spatial translational invariance we can write generally @xmath35",
    "if we now set @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath38 is the temperature , then the fdt is obeyed and the corresponding fokker - planck equation admits a steady - state equilibrium solution @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "in contrast , in nonequilibrium situations there are no general relations linking the noise variance and the kinetic coefficients and the fdt is broken . since noises in a langevin description",
    "describe the effects of the environment ( e.g. , thermal baths ) , such nonequilibrium noises reflect external drives .",
    "what are the simplest choices of the noise variances which explicitly break the fdt , without having to break the @xmath0 symmetry ?",
    "one possible way to do that is to introduce two different noise strengths in the noise correlation matrix and break the fdt .",
    "this can be realized by the choice @xmath40 such a choice as above will certainly break the fdt but unfortunately will break the @xmath0 symmetry of the ensuing dynamics as well .",
    "@xcite investigated nonequilibrium critical properties of o(n)-symmetric models with reversible mode - coupling terms .",
    "specifically , a variant of the model of sasvri , schwabl , and szpfalusy ( sss ) is studied , where violation of detailed balance is incorporated by allowing the order parameter and the dynamically coupled conserved quantities to be governed by heat baths of different temperatures .",
    "they however find that upon approaching the critical point detailed balance is restored , and the equilibrium static and dynamic critical properties are recovered .",
    "yet another option is to couple the system with the corresponding conserved angular momentum and introduce dynamical anisotropy in the noise for the conserved quantities , i.e. , by constraining their diffusive dynamics to be at different temperatures @xmath41 and @xmath42 in @xmath43- and @xmath44-dimensional subspaces , respectively , see ref .",

    "@xcite showed that the equilibrium fixed point ( with isotropic noise ) to be stable with respect to these non - equilibrium perturbations , and the familiar equilibrium exponents therefore describe the asymptotic static and dynamic critical behavior .",
    "novel critical features are only found in extreme limits , where the ratio of the effective noise temperatures @xmath45 is either zero or infinite . in a similar study , ref .",
    "@xcite discussed nonequlibrium dynamics in a liquid - gas model with reversible mode couplings .",
    "the model is driven out of equilibrium by introducing different temperatures for different dynamical variables , or , by having anisotropic noises .",
    "however , no new genuine nonequilibrium stable fixed point is found ( within one - loop calculations ) .",
    "similar approaches to nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the relaxational models c and d ( in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are discussed in ref .",

    "an alternative route to introduce detailed balance violation in the simple model a - type relaxational dynamics for the order parameter @xmath17is to introduce non - zero noise cross correlations which will make the noise matrix off - diagonal .",
    "this will break the fdt as the noise matrix is then not proportional to the kinetic coefficient matrix ( which is proportional to the unit matrix in the present case ) .",
    "we take cross noise strengths as @xmath46 .",
    "we write @xmath47 in general the function @xmath48 is a complex function of wavevector @xmath25",
    ".    the form of the function @xmath46 may be restricted by demanding rotational invariance of the noise variance matrix ( equivalently by demanding @xmath0 symmetry of the dynamics ) . under a rotation by an arbitrary angle @xmath49 in the order parameter space",
    "the noise variance matrix transforms to n= (    cc & + - &    ) (    cc d & + ^ * & d    ) (    cc & - + &    ) .[noisemat ] where the noise variance matrix before rotation is n= (    cc d & + ^ * & d    ) .",
    "now we demand @xmath50 due to rotational invariance .",
    "this after a simple algebra then yields that the noise cross correlation amplitude should be fully imaginary or @xmath51 .",
    "since in the real space @xmath52 must be a real function , we find @xmath53 must be an odd function of @xmath25 . in order for the noise cross correlation to have the same nave dimension as @xmath54 (",
    "so that both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are equally _ relevant _ in an rg sense ) , we set @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a constant ( and has the same dimension as @xmath58 ) .",
    "we henceforth replace @xmath46 by @xmath59 where @xmath48 is now completely real .",
    "this reflects the fully imaginary nature of the cross correlation explicitly .",
    "thus the explicit forms of the two equations of motion for @xmath60 and @xmath61 are @xmath62 complemented by the noise variances as below : @xmath63 one may in addition consider including a conserved angular momentum as a slow variable in the problem ( see , e.g. , model e in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we do not do that here for simplicity .",
    "model equations ( [ basiceom ] ) suffices for our purposes of exploring nonuniversal features in a simple setting .",
    "are there limits on the value of @xmath1 in this model ? to obtain that we demand the noise variance matrix to have eigenvalues which are real positive or zero .",
    "the eigenvalues concerned are @xmath64 .",
    "thus @xmath65 , or in terms of a dimensionless number @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "in the subsequent calculations we will find that @xmath68 enters into the expressions of different scaling exponents explicitly .    equations of motion ( [ basiceom ] ) are written in an @xmath0 invariant representation .",
    "using the equivalence between @xmath0 and @xmath69 representations , one may write an equivalent @xmath69 representation of the dynamics . the free energy in the @xmath69 representation takes the form @xmath70=\\int d^dx [ \\tau\\psi\\psi^ * + ( \\nabla \\psi ) ( \\nabla\\psi^ * ) + \\frac{u}{3 ! } ( \\psi\\psi^*)^2 ] , \\label{u1}\\ ] ] where complex fields @xmath71 ; @xmath72 is the complex conjugate of @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding langevin equations of motion in the overdamped limit are given by @xmath74 where zero - mean gaussian distributed complex noise @xmath26 has the following correlations in the fourier space : @xmath75 thus introduction of noise cross - correlations in the @xmath0 description is equivalent to adding an imaginary and odd function of @xmath25 in the variance @xmath76 . before we embark upon detailed calculation let us consider possible physical ( microscopic ) realizations of our continuum model in terms of stochastic lattice - gas models .",
    "however , what we discuss below does not fully and precisely define a microscopic model , but rather outlines broad features that an eventual appropriate microscopic realization should posses .",
    "consider a system of xy ( @xmath77 spins ) either on a ( hypercubic ) lattice or a continuum in @xmath3-dimensions , interacting with an additional mobile species in the system which diffuses randomly , undergoing symmetric exclusion process ( sep ) to any of the nearest sites , if vacant .",
    "a simple model of interaction between these two species could be where each diffusing particle carries an xy spin attached to it , and the nearest - neighbor exchange coupling @xmath78 that defines the xy model is related to the local particle density @xmath79 at site @xmath80 via @xmath81 .",
    "next , noting that the microscopic dynamics of both the spins and particles are stochastic , characterized by two sets of random numbers @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , we impose that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are cross - correlated , with the cross - correlation function being of the form ( in the continuum limit ) @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are two points in the lattice , @xmath89 is a numerical constant and @xmath90 is an odd function of position @xmath91 having the same dimension as @xmath92 .",
    "the presence of the odd function @xmath93 in the cross - correlation function ensures lack of reflection invariance of the underlying stochastic microscopic dynamics .",
    "thus the measured quantities ( e.g. , correlation functions of appropriate densities ) should reflect this lack of reflection invariance . at this level , the dynamics for the additional species is clearly conserving .",
    "this implies there will be no timescale present on which the additional variables of the mobile species can be treated as fast and eliminated to yield an effective equation of motion for the xy spins alone with the effects of the diffusing species buried in the additive noises in the effective spin equations .",
    "however , if particle nonconservation is introduced , e.g. , via evaporation - deposition affects , the local particle density dynamics will be fast and then may be eliminated to produce an effective spin dynamics .",
    "since the noises in such effective theories contain information about the already eliminated fast degrees of freedom ( in this case the local diffusing particle density ) , there will be non - zero noise cross - correlations of specified structures as above , due to the particular chosen structure of the underlying reflection invariance breaking microscopic dynamics .",
    "alternatively , one may introduce the driving as a temporally delta - correlated fluctuating magnetic field @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 having short ranged spatial correlations as in ( [ finalnoise ] ) . in both the cases , noise cross - correlations of appropriate structures will be generated in the effective langevin description . with this short background in mind ,",
    "let us now investigate the universal scaling properties of the model described by the langevin equations ( [ basiceom ] ) together with the noise variances ( [ finalnoise ] ) .",
    "the presence of non - linear terms in eqs .",
    "( [ basiceom ] ) rules out exact solutions , and we resort to perturbative calculations that we discuss below .",
    "let us first consider the high temperature phase of the system . at high temperature with @xmath97 ,",
    "the system is in the paramagnetic phase , i.e. , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 means averaging over the noise distributions .",
    "the correlation length @xmath26 remains finite for all @xmath97 .",
    "the only effect of the noise cross - correlations is to make the cross - correlation function @xmath100 non - zero with a finite correlation length @xmath26 .",
    "further , as in equilibrium critical dynamics , the paramagnetic phase is linearly stable and the fluctuations have a finite life time for all wavevector . nevertheless , the fdt is violated for all @xmath97 due to the noise cross - correlations .    near the critical point ,",
    "the system becomes scale invariant and the correlation length @xmath26 diverges , leading to the emerging macroscopic physics near the critical point being vastly different from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "a quantitative description of the nature of correlations near the critical point requires the principles and formalisms of the dynamic renormalization group ( drg ) , which we execute here by using a field - theoretic framework .",
    "detail discussions of the technical aspect of field - theoretic drg calculations are well - documented in the literature , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . in order to set up the background",
    "let us examine the linearized version of the model equations ( [ basiceom ] ) together with the noise correlations ( [ noisevar ] ) at @xmath101 by dropping all the non - linear terms ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the system remains @xmath0 invariant , but the fdt is already broken at this linear level due to the noise cross - correlations .",
    "obviously , the field correlations from the linearized model equations can be exactly calculated . in this linear theory , in the critical region , defined by @xmath101 , the linear theory is massless resulting in divergent long wavelength fluctuations , as can be seen by explicit calculations of the correlation functions @xmath103 , which may be written down in a scaling form at the critical point @xmath101 : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is an analytic function of its argument . for the cross - correlation function @xmath106 ( and by symmetry @xmath107 )",
    "displays the same scaling form , but with a different amplitude and is an odd function of @xmath91 .    what is the nature of these diverging fluctuations when the non - linear terms are present ( @xmath15 ) ?",
    "the presence of nonlinear terms no longer allows for exact solutions , in contrast to the linearized theory .",
    "however , this question may be systematically addressed via standard implementation of drg procedure , based on a perturbative expansion in the _ small _ coupling @xmath20 about the linear theory .",
    "the perturbative corrections to the correlation function may be equivalently viewed as arising from modifications ( renormalization ) of the parameters @xmath108 and the dynamical fields @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "renormalizability of the theory ensures that correlator @xmath109 will retain scaling forms similar to ( [ scalingform ] ) with exponents different from those appearing in ( [ scalingform ] ) and new scaling functions at ( renormalized ) @xmath101 : @xmath110 where @xmath18 and @xmath111 are the anomalous dimension and dynamic exponents respectively , and @xmath112 is a new scaling function @xcite . for the linear theory described above , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the nonlinear coupling @xmath20 is expected to change these exponents for the linear theory .",
    "the equilibrium critical dynamics of several nonlinear problems have been described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our subsequent analysis",
    "below we assume renormalizability and justify it _ post facto _ by a low order ( up to two - loop ) perturbation theory .    operationally , the drg procedure is conveniently performed in terms of a path integral description based on a dynamic generating functional which is to be constructed out of the langevin equations ( [ basiceom ] ) and the corresponding noise variances given by eq .  ( [ finalnoise ] ) following standard procedures @xcite .",
    "the dynamic generating functional for the present model is given by & = & _ 1 d_2 d_1 d_2 + & & , [ gen ] where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are conjugate response fields corresponding to the order parameter fields @xmath60 and @xmath61 used to obtain the noise - averaged generating functional @xmath117 . clearly , with our choice of the noise cross - correlations , the generating functional respects the @xmath0 symmetry of the underlying dynamics , but explicitly breaks the fdt .",
    "it now remains to be seen whether this breakdown of the fdt remains valid even for the _ effective , renormalized _ version of this theory , or it is restored in the long wavelength limit . in the above we have used the ito prescription @xcite while writing down the generating functional ( [ gen ] ) .",
    "the perturbative calculational framework begins with the construction of the perturbation expansion of one - particle irreducible feynman diagrams for all possible correlation and the corresponding vertex functions constructed out of the fields @xmath60 , @xmath115 , @xmath61 and @xmath116 .",
    "such a perturbation expansion is meaningful only wheen the coupling @xmath20 is small .",

    "first of all , as is evident from the results presented above , the static susceptibility and the equal - time correlation function _ do not _ display the same spatial scaling , since @xmath223 .",
    "this is an important evidence of breakdown of the fdt in the renormalized theory .",
    "note , in the linearized theory breakdown of the fdt is manifested in the existence of non - zero cross - correlation functions : the correlation matrix pick up non - zero off - diagonal elements , where as the dynamic susceptibility matrix remains diagonal .",
    "nevertheless , all elements of the correlation and the dynamic susceptibility matrix exhibit the same scaling properties at the critical point .",
    "in contrast , in the renormalized non - linear theory , not only the correlation matrix is off - diagonal where as the susceptibility matrix remains diagonal , the elements of the correlation matrix scale differently from those of the susceptibility matrix .",
    "the latter result is purely a non - linear effect .",
    "further , the dynamic exponent for finite @xmath68 , @xmath224 is larger than @xmath225 , its value for equilibrium dynamics .",
    "thus relaxation for finite @xmath68 is _ slower _ than for the corresponding equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the correlation length exponent @xmath19 has been calculated only up to @xmath226 and is equal to its equilibrium value . however , as there are @xmath68-dependent corrections to @xmath227 at the two - loop order , the value of @xmath19 is likely to be different from its equilibrium value at the two - loop order .",
    "lastly , the @xmath68-dependence of all the scaling exponents are _ continuous _ - all of them vary continuously with @xmath68 and go over to their equilibrium values when @xmath68 is set to zero .",
    "our claim of the scaling exponents varying continuously with @xmath68 rests on the marginality of @xmath68 .",
    "we have shown explicitly up to two - loop order that @xmath183 does not renormalize . hence @xmath68 does not renormalize up to two - loop order and depends on the bare value of @xmath228 .",
    "any non - zero fluctuation corrections to @xmath48 must be an odd function of the its wavevector argument . in order to have that one must have odd number of internal cross - correlation line .",
    "since all internal wavevectors are integrated over , such a contribution will vanish in the limit of vanishing external wavevector and frequency .",
    "thus @xmath48 and remains unrenormalized and hence @xmath68 appears as a dimensionless marginal operator to any order in perturbation .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the universal scaling properties of a nonequilibrium version of @xmath0-symmetric dynamical model near the critical point .",
    "we write down a non - conserved relaxational dynamics for the order parameter field .",
    "we have introduced cross - correlations between the two additive noises in the langevin equations , so that the fdt is immediately broken .",
    "we then show that if the cross - correlation is imaginary and odd in wavevector , the underlying @xmath0 symmetry is still maintained .",
    "we calculate the scaling exponents of the model in a drg framework using an @xmath9-expansion scheme , where @xmath229 with 4 being the upper critical dimension of the model .",
    "we show that at the two - loop order there are diagrammatic corrections to the various two - point vertex functions in the model arising from the cross - correlations .",
    "we have used heuristic arguments to extract the dominant contributions to the two - loop diagrams involving cross - correlations , which have allowed us to evaluate the respective cross - correlation contributions in a simple and controlled manner .",
    "we finally argue that the cross - correlation amplitude appears as a marginal operator in the problem .",
    "since this amplitude appears in the expressions of the scaling exponents we have an example of a continuously varying universality class . technically speaking we obtain a _ fixed line _",
    ", parametrized by the value of the parameter @xmath68 introduced above , instead of a single or isolated fixed points .",
    "every point on the fixed line characterizes a universality class , parametrized again by @xmath68 .",
    "the fixed line begins from @xmath222 , which is the equilibrium fixed point .",
    "this stands in contrast to , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , where nonequilibrium noises lead to additional fixed points , but not a fixed line as here .",
    "there are other dynamical models where cross - correlated noises lead to universal properties varying continuously with the amplitude of the noise cross - correlations .",
    "notable examples are the stochastically driven generalized burgers model ( gbm ) @xcite and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence ( mhd ) @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath3-dimensional gbm and mhd models are intrinsically nonequilibrium and do not generally have an equilibrium limit : switching off the noise cross - correlation does not make these models equilibrium in general @xmath3-dimensions .",
    "in contrast , the present model has a well - defined equilibrium limit given by @xmath222 for any dimension @xmath3 .",
    "thus not only does our model here exhibit continuously varying universal properties , it can be driven away from equilibrium continuously and incrementally by tuning @xmath68 . continuously varying",
    "universality has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite as well . however , ref .",
    "@xcite required coupling of the order parameter field with a conserved density .",
    "in contrast in our work we have the order parameter field only as the relevant dynamical field .",
    "quantitative accuracy of our results is limited by the heuristic arguments we resorted to while evaluating the diagrams arising from noise cross - correlations . in order to verify this",
    ", direct numerical simulations of the model langevin equations , or simulations of appropriately defined lattice - gas models should be performed . in the present article",
    "we have discussed the universal scaling properties at the critical point only .",
    "numerical simulations of a driven @xmath230 model @xcite displays existence of spatio - temporal chaotic low - temperature regime below its critical point in the absence of stochastic noises .",
    "this chaos , when _ controlled _ , is replaced by spatially periodic steady helical states which are robust against noise . in view of these results in ref .",
    "@xcite , it would be interesting to examine the properties of the ordered phase below @xmath27 , and their dependences on the parameter @xmath68 introduced above . in the above",
    "we have confined ourselves in discussing a usual order - disorder transition and the associated universality at the critical point . for any model ,",
    "such a scenario holds as long as the physical dimension is greater than the lower critical dimension @xmath231 of the model . for equilibrium models with continuous symmetries ,",
    "e.g. , the @xmath0-symmetric model in equilibrium , the mermin - wagner theorem tells us that @xmath232 . for models out of equilibrium , there are no such general results",
    ". it would be interesting to examine the present model , perhaps through non - perturbative methods , at @xmath233 , in particular the role and dynamics of topological defects in the presence of noise cross - correlations .",
    "we hope our theoretical results will inspire more detailed theoretical studies on more realistic models or experimental work on driven systems with coupled variables , where the role of noise cross - correlations in determining the universal properties may be explicitly tested .",
