    "gas accretes with negative peculiar velocity onto the host , is enriched and accelerated to outflow velocities of a few hundred @xmath11 by blastwave feedback , and slows down as it sweeps the ism and halo material .",
    "the peak velocity is comparable to those observed in high redshift lbgs ( e , g .",

    "it is also comparable to the velocities adopted in various kinetic feedback models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . after reaching a peak value , the gas proper velocity declines rapidly , and particles",
    "are swept by the hubble flow as they move farther from the center into the igm .",
    "this behaviour is typical of all enriched gas particles .",
    "the rapid decline of the proper velocity is also seen in the kinetic feedback model of @xcite , where outflowing particles are allowed to interact hydrodyamically with the ism , and pressure forces within the disk significantly decrease the wind speed .",
    "observations of local starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that outflow speeds are correlated with halo masses and star formation rates , and that the correlation flattens out for sfr@xmath122 @xcite . to investigate the existence of such relationship in the erismc simulation , we plot in the upper panel of figure [ fig15 ] the peak velocity of gas particles that become unbound after they are enriched in the main host , as a function of their enrichment redshift .",
    "we choose the gas peak velocity as this is close to the flow speed when the wind is launched , and is relatively unaffected by interactions between the outflow and the ism / gaseous halo .",
    "note that , because of the limited time resolution , we may actually underestimate the peak velocity of gas particles that reach a maximum speed and then slow down significantly within the time interval of two simulation outputs ( @xmath123 myr ) .",
    "the scatter plot shows that enriched gas particles can often reach velocities in excess of @xmath124 , with a few of them moving as fast as @xmath125 , a value that is consistent with the highest velocity material observed in lbgs at @xmath126 by @xcite .",
    "the mass and metal - weighted outflow average speed typically ranges between 200 and 400 @xmath11 . from redshift 9.3 to 3.0 , the total mass of the main host halo increases from @xmath127 to @xmath128 .",
    "the mean outflow speed increases for @xmath129 and decreases again at @xmath130 , so there is no obvious correlation between halo mass and the peak outflow velocity in erismc .",
    "similarly , we find only a weak correlation between the maximum wind velocity and star formation rate .",
    "however , if we define the mass averaged mean outflow velocity at distance @xmath131 as :    @xmath132    where n is the total number of outflow gas particles in a radial shell of thickness @xmath1330.02 @xmath63 at distance @xmath131 , @xmath134 is the mass of particle @xmath55 and @xmath135 its outflow radial velocity ( relative to the host s center ) .",
    "there is a correlation between the mean outflow velocity and the peak circular velocity of the host , as shown in figure [ fig16 ] .",
    "figure [ fig17 ] shows the metallicity of inflowing and outflowing material at erismc s virial radius as a function of redshift .",
    "galactic outflows are enriched to a typical metallicity in the range @xmath136 since redshift @xmath137 , with little dependence on cosmic time .",
    "the mean metallicity of inflowing gas shows a more marked evolution , as it increases by about one dex in the interval @xmath138 .",
    "this is a consequence of more processed material falling back onto erismc in a  halo fountain \" @xcite as well as being accreted via infalling satellites .",
    "only half of the inflowing material at @xmath63 is unprocessed primordial gas .",
    "the gas metallicity of inflowing gas at z @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) is typical of the metallicity observed in damped ly@xmath141 and lyman - limit systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mass loading factor characterizes the amount of material involved in a galactic outflow , and is defined as @xmath142sfr , where @xmath143 is the rate at which mass is ejected .",
    "observations of galactic outflows powered by starbursts suggest a wide range of mass loading factors , @xmath144 , with no obvious correlation with the star formation rates of their hosts @xcite . in low - resolution cosmological simulations ,",
    "the mass loading factor is one of the input parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most models adopt a constant mass loading factor , except for the momentum - driven model @xcite , where it is assumed to be inversely proportional to the host galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath145 , @xmath146 . in our sn - driven blastwave feedback scheme",
    "there is no specific parameter for mass loading . in this section",
    "we explore the mass loading factor in erismc and its variation with star formation and halo mass .",
    "we compute the wind mass loading at a distance @xmath131 from the center as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the thickness of the radial shell , n is the total number of outflow gas particles in the shell , @xmath134 is the mass of particle @xmath55 and @xmath135 its outflow radial velocity ( relative to the host s center ) .",
    "we have measured the mass flux at 0.2 , half , and one virial radius , and divided it by the instantaneous sfr ignoring any time delay between star formation and large - scale outflow , for erismc and the 9 most massive dwarf halos within 250 kpc at @xmath0 .",
    "we find ( see fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] ) a strong correlation of the mass - loading factor ( @xmath149 ) and the mean outflow velocity ( @xmath150 ) with halo mass .",
    "while @xmath149 is of order unity for the main host , it can exceed 10 ( and reaches 80 in one case ) for nearby dwarfs and satellites .",
    "similarly , @xmath150 increases from @xmath20 50 km / s for nearby dwarfs to @xmath20 150 km / s for the main host .",
    "satellite systems of erismc are indicated with open square symbols in the figure , as their mass loss and outflow velocity may be affected by tidal stripping .",
    "it is interesting to note here that , with a comparable mass loading factor to erismc , our eris2 simulation @xcite appears to be able to produce interstellar absorption line strengths of , , , , and as a function of galactocentric impact parameter that are in good agreement with those observed at high - redshift by @xcite .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the metal - enriched cgm of a massive galaxy at @xmath0 using results from a zoom - in hydrodynamic simulation of a disk galaxy with mass comparable to the milky way .",
    "our approach to understanding the role of inflows , star formation feedback , and outflows in governing the gaseous and metal content of galaxies and their environment , is different to that of many recent theoretical efforts : eris extreme mass and spatial resolution allows us to follow self - consistently the venting of metals by small progenitor dwarf satellites and the transport of heavy elements from their production sites into the environment .",
    "the reference run adopts a blastwave scheme for supernova feedback that generates galactic outflows without explicit wind particles , and a star formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold .",
    "we have found that erismc s metal - enriched cgm extends as far as 4 virial radii ( about 200 physical kpc ) from its center .",
    "approximately 41% , 9% , and 50% of all gas - phase heavy elements within 250 kpc from the center are hot ( @xmath4 k ) , warm ( @xmath151 k ) , and cold ( @xmath6 k ) , respectively .",
    "more than 40% of all gas - phase metals lie outside the virial radius : while cold metal - rich material traces large overdensities within the main host , about 50% of all warm and 70% of all hot metals are found in low density @xmath152 regions beyond erismc s virial radius .",
    "intergalactic metals are characterized by a strong temperature gradient with overdensity , as the metal - weighted temperature climbs from @xmath78 k at @xmath84 to above @xmath85 k at @xmath86 .",
    "sn - driven winds are able to transport metals to regions at @xmath91 where they accumulate , creating a peak in the cold gas metallicity - density relation at @xmath153 .",
    "the mean metallicity of cold gas drops quickly below @xmath89 at overdensities @xmath91 .",
    "we have identified three sources of heavy elements in the simulated region : 1 ) the main host , responsible for 60% percent of all the metals found within @xmath7 , and for none of those found beyond @xmath7 ; 2 ) its satellite progenitors  systems accreted by the main halo before redshift 3 , which shed their metals before and during infall and are responsible for 28% of all the metals within @xmath7 ; and its orbiting nearby dwarfs , which give origin to 12% of all the metals within @xmath7 and 95% of those beyond @xmath7 .",
    "late ( @xmath8 ) galactic  superwinds \"  the result of recent star formation in erismc  account for only 9% of all the metals observed beyond @xmath9 , the rest having been released at redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "these findings confirm the ideas put forward by @xcite , that enrichment from nearby dwarfs may contribute significantly to ( and dominate at large distances ) the pollution of the cgm around lbgs .",
    "@xcite argued that massive galaxies at high redshift are likely to be surrounded by the metal bubbles produced by nearby dwarfs and satellites at earlier epochs , and that gravity will tend to increase the spatial association between such metal bubbles and lbgs .",
    "the strong association observed between stronger  systems and lbgs led @xcite to argue that metal - rich  superwinds \" from lbgs may be responsible for distributing the product of stellar nucleosynthesis on ( comoving ) mpc scales .",
    "the analytical results of @xcite and the simulations presented here show that this is not the case , as it is nearby dwarfs that dominate the metal enrichment beyond 2 - 3 @xmath154 of lbgs .",
    "this is not to imply that most of the metals observed in the igm at high redshift have been ejected by dwarf galaxies : rather than , as a function of distance from a massive system , the contribution of the main host becomes sub - dominant compared to that of its smaller companions .",
    "simulations of larger cosmological volumes are needed to assess whether our results are consistent with observations of the diffuse metal - enriched igm .",
    "substantial amounts of heavy elements are generated at a larger distance from the main host s center than their current location , and subsequently are accreted by the host along filaments via low - metallicity cold inflows .",
    "galactic outflows have velocities of a few hundred @xmath11 .",
    "the outflows decelerate rapidly , and the resulting long metal transport timescales produce an age gradient in metals as a function of distance from the main host .",

    ", sph does not include any implicit diffusion of scalar quantities such as metals . in the absence of some implementation of diffusion",
