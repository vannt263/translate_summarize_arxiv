    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern near geneva , switzerland is about to become operative . the searches at the lhc for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) will mainly include the potential discoveries of the higgs boson , supersymmetry , and extra dimensions .",
    "in this paper , we will be interested in the third issue , _",
    "i.e. _ , extra dimensions . indeed , an observation of extra dimensions would be truly revolutionary and would completely change our view of the universe .    the idea that spacetime could have more than four dimensions",
    "was first proposed by theodore kaluza @xcite and oskar klein @xcite at the beginning of the twentieth century .",
    "one of the most interesting features of extra dimensions is that they are not ruled out by experiments , provided only that they are compact and small enough to have avoided detection so far . in the scenario known as large extra dimensions",
    ", they could even be macroscopically large .",
    "large extra dimensions were first proposed by arkani - hamed , dvali , and dimopoulos ( add ) in 1998 , their model being known as the add model @xcite .",
    "the novel feature of this model is the assumption that the sm fields are confined to a so - called brane , which is a four - dimensional manifold residing in the full bulk spacetime .",
    "this brane is to be identified with ordinary four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "since the sm fields are not allowed to probe the extra dimensions , experimental constraints on their size are avoided to a large extent .",
    "gravity , on the other hand , carries no sm charges and is allowed to probe the extra dimensions . in principle , the assumption that gravity lives in a higher - dimensional spacetime leads to sizable deviations from newton s inverse - square law at short distances .",
    "however , because of the weakness of the gravitational force relative to the sm forces , newton s law has only been tested down to distances of the order of micrometers , and hence , the experimental constraints are still quite weak .",
    "one of the main motivations for the add model is that it provides a solution to the so - called hierarchy problem between the electroweak scale @xmath0 and the ( reduced ) planck scale @xmath1 .",
    "theoretically , the bare higgs mass is expected to receive higher - order quantum corrections of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "this would mean that extreme fine - tuning of the parameters would be needed in order for the electroweak scale to be as low as @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the add model provides a very elegant solution to this problem .",
    "since gravity really propagates in more than four spacetime dimensions , the planck scale that we observe through gravitational measurements is an effective scale , valid only for energies lower than the inverse of the radius of the internal space .",
    "the planck scale is related to the true fundamental energy scale for gravity through the volume of the internal space .",
    "if this volume is large enough , then the fundamental scale for gravity could actually be as low as the electroweak scale .",
    "however , there is a problem related to this solution in the add model .",
    "while the problem of the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the fundamental scale for gravity is solved , there is a new large hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the inverse of the radius of the internal space .",
    "thus , the hierarchy problem is only reformulated as the question of why the radius of the internal space is so large compared to the electroweak scale .",
    "however , in the add model , the internal space is assumed to be flat and compactified on a torus .",
    "thus , one possible solution to the problem of the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the radius of the internal space is to drop this assumption and instead consider a different geometry .",
    "therefore , it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that a compact hyperbolic internal space in particular is a better alternative than the flat geometry of the add model .",
    "note that , in some sense , the hyperbolic model is a generalization of the add model .",
    "in addition , it should be mentioned that there are other models of extra dimensions that include branes .",
    "one of the most important models is the so - called randall  sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite , in which two branes are introduced and the sm fields are confined to one of these branes only .",
    "nevertheless , we will not consider such models further .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate large extra dimensions with the internal space being a two - dimensional hyperbolic disc .",
    "especially , we study two plausible signals , _",
    "i.e. _ , the reactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes a kaluza  klein ( kk ) mode of the graviton , that could be measured at the lhc using missing - energy techniques .",
    "it should be noted that the hyperbolic disc model , like the add model , is only an effective theory , which means that it is a non - renormalizable low - energy approximation of a more fundamental theory that is called the ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of the effective theory .",
    "the phenomenology of the add model has been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , signals of the add model that are relevant for the lhc have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a model with a spherical internal space has been examined .",
    "in addition , a model of rs type , which is similar to ours , was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the setting of discretized extra dimensions . finally , hyperbolic extra dimensions could have interesting implications in cosmology , which have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , though we will not discuss this issue further in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thehyperbolicdiscmodel ] , we present the hyperbolic disc model for large extra dimensions and obtain an approximate form for the kk spectrum of the graviton in this model . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : interactions ] , we analyze the interactions between the graviton and the sm fields that are relevant for the plausible signals of the model at the lhc .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : numericalanalysisofsignals ] , we give our numerical results for the cross sections of the signals discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : interactions ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summaryandconclusions ] , we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the model that we consider is similar to the add model , with the only exception that the internal space is a two - dimensional hyperbolic disc , which is denoted @xmath7 .",
    "hence , the geometry of the higher - dimensional spacetime is a product @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes four - dimensional minkowski space .",
    "the sm fields are assumed to be confined to a four - dimensional brane , while gravity alone probes the extra dimensions .",
    "the metric for the six - dimensional spacetime is @xmath10,\\]]where @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 are polar coordinates and @xmath13 is the curvature of the disc .",
    "the coordinate system is such that @xmath14 is the physical radial distance between the origin and a point @xmath15 .",
    "we follow the convention that indices in the full spacetime are written as upper - case roman letters , @xmath16 , minkowski indices are written as lower - case greek letters , @xmath17 , and indices in the internal space are written as lower - case roman letters , @xmath18 .",
    "also , @xmath19 denotes the coordinates in @xmath9 or in the full higher - dimensional spacetime and @xmath20 the coordinates in @xmath7 . note that @xmath21 , which means that there is no ambiguity in using the symbol @xmath22 for both of these quantities . the number of extra dimensions is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "the most common way to hide the extra dimensions is through compactification of the internal space as a quotient space @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of the internal space . in this paper , we consider instead an internal space with an explicit boundary .",
    "the main motivation for this choice is computational simplicity . for an internal space of hyperbolic geometry ,",
    "it is not possible to solve for the kk spectrum analytically . instead",
    ", numerical calculations are needed , and these are much simpler in a space with a boundary than in a quotient space .",
    "we do not attempt to describe the origin of the boundary , but simply to investigate its possible implications .",
    "an important consequence of this choice of geometry is that , in contrast to the add model , the physical results depend on the position of the brane in the internal space .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the metric is @xmath26 . as mentioned , we do not attempt to justify this solution of einstein s equations . for a deeper discussion , see refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the most important advantage of a hyperbolic space is that it offers the possibility of a more satisfactory solution to the hierarchy problem than the add model does , as is described below .",
    "another important advantage is that astrophysical constraints on the lower bound on the fundamental mass scale , which are particularly important in the two - dimensional add model @xcite , can be avoided to a large extent .",
    "thus , the model can allow for a low value of this mass scale even in the case of two extra dimensions only .",
    "the constraints on the parameter space are described in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] .    since gravity is the only field probing the internal space , it plays an important part in any phenomenological studies of the model . by assumption",
    ", it is governed by the six - dimensional einstein ",
    "hilbert action @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ricci scalar , @xmath29 is a cosmological constant , and the mass scale @xmath30 is introduced in order to make the action dimensionless . in the same way as in the add model , @xmath30 replaces the planck scale @xmath2 as the fundamental mass scale for gravity .",
    "the two scales are related through the equation @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 is the volume of the internal space .",
    "however , note that the definition of the fundamental mass scale differs between authors . in order for the model to provide a solution to the hierarchy problem , we demand that @xmath30 is of the order of @xmath33 . in",
    "the add model , where @xmath34 , this gives the radius @xmath35 , which is unnaturally large in comparison to @xmath30 if @xmath23 is not very large .",
    "hence , the hierarchy problem is not really solved , but simply rephrased as the question of why the product @xmath36 is large . in our model , on the other hand , the volume of the internal space is @xmath37 for large @xmath38 , the volume increases exponentially as a function of the radius .",
    "this has the consequence that the relation between the mass scale and the volume of the internal space can be satisfied for @xmath39 without generating a large hierarchy between @xmath30 and @xmath40 , if @xmath13 is suitably adjusted .",
    "this fact is our main motivation for the hyperbolic geometry of the internal space . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ml ] , the product @xmath36 is plotted as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the result is nearly independent of @xmath30 in the range that we are interested in . for @xmath41",
    ", we obtain the lowest possible value @xmath42 , while for smaller @xmath13 , the value of the product is significantly larger .",
    "note that our effective model is supposed to be valid only up to energies of the order of @xmath30 , and hence , we do not consider values of @xmath13 larger than this scale .",
    "thus , the best possible solution to the hierarchy problem in our model is obtained when the curvature @xmath13 is of the same order of magnitude as the fundamental mass scale . in this case",
    ", there is also no new hierarchy problem involving @xmath13 .     as a function of @xmath43.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      in order to investigate the phenomenology of our model , we now use the ordinary procedure of kk decomposition to reformulate it as an equivalent four - dimensional field theory . in this picture , the graviton field propagating in the full spacetime is represented by an infinite kk tower of particles with different masses , called the kk modes of the graviton .",
    "the set of masses is known as the kk spectrum , and each mass corresponds to a quantum of momentum in the internal space .    in the add model with @xmath23 extra dimensions ,",
    "the graviton living in the full spacetime is expanded in terms of harmonic functions @xmath44 with corresponding masses @xmath45 . here , @xmath46 is a @xmath23-dimensional vector with integer entries . in our model ,",
    "the geometry is more complicated , and this has the result that it is not possible to obtain the kk spectrum analytically .",
    "thus , in this section , we derive approximate expressions for the kk modes and masses in our model .",
    "the starting point is the equations of motion for the graviton . from the action",
    ", it follows that the free equations of motion are the free einstein equations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the ricci tensor .",
    "the dynamics of the graviton is studied by expanding these equations to first order in a perturbation @xmath49 about the background metric .",
    "the perturbation @xmath49 is interpreted as the massless spin-2 graviton field in the six - dimensional spacetime .",
    "we are only interested in the dynamics of the four - dimensional part @xmath50 of the perturbation , and hence , we make the simplifying approximation of setting all other components to zero , which has often been done in the literature @xcite . therefore , the resulting metric is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the minkowski metric and the factor @xmath53 ensures that the graviton has the correct dimension , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath54 . under the assumption that the unperturbed einstein equations are satisfied",
    ", the detailed derivation of the linearized equations of motion has been performed in ref .",
    "the resulting equations are @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the laplace ",
    "beltrami ( lb ) operator , which is the generalization of the laplace operator to curved spaces . in terms of a coordinate system @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath58 because of the factorizable geometry , the laplace  beltrami operator can be written as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the dalembert operator in four - dimensional minkowski space and @xmath61 is the laplace ",
    "beltrami operator in the two - dimensional hyperbolic space . in order to reformulate the theory without explicit reference to the extra dimensions , @xmath50",
    "is expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions of @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath62 the coefficient functions @xmath63 are the kk modes of the graviton , satisfying the equations @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenfunction @xmath66 . here , @xmath67 denotes any general set of kaluza  klein indices . from eq .",
    ", it follows that @xmath68 has the interpretation of the mass of the kk mode @xmath69 .",
    "although no analytic form for the kk spectrum is known , several important results are generally true for the spectrum of the laplace ",
    "beltrami operator on a riemannian manifold @xmath70 ( possibly with a boundary ) .",
    "it is assumed that the closure of @xmath70 is connected and compact , which is true for a hyperbolic disc .",
    "the eigenfunctions belong to the hilbert space @xmath71 of square - integrable functions on @xmath70 , with the inner product given by @xmath72 where the star denotes complex conjugation .",
    "then , if the boundary conditions fall into one of the four categories a ) dirichlet conditions , b ) neumann conditions , c ) mixed dirichlet and neumann conditions , or d ) periodic conditions , the following results hold @xcite :    1 .",
    "the set of eigenvalues consists of a sequence , @xmath73 in the case of neumann or periodic conditions , or @xmath74 in the other cases , and each associated eigenspace is finite - dimensional .",
    "[ item : point1 ] 2 .",
    "eigenspaces , belonging to distinct eigenvalues , are orthogonal in @xmath71 , which is the direct sum of all eigenspaces .    thus , when the internal space is compact , the spectrum of the laplace ",
    "beltrami operator is countable , and it is possible to make a kk expansion of the type .",
    "now , we need boundary conditions at @xmath75 and @xmath76 . at @xmath75",
    ", we only have to demand that the solutions are finite . at @xmath76 ,",
    "the possible alternatives are in principle dirichlet or neumann conditions , or a combination of both .",
    "as mentioned above , the eigenvalues are interpreted as the squared masses of the corresponding kk modes , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath77 .",
    "according to [ item : point1 ] .",
    ", there is no massless mode in the spectrum for dirichlet or mixed conditions , while for neumann conditions there is such a mode .",
    "hence , in order to obtain the correct low - energy behavior , we impose neumann conditions at @xmath76 .",

    "hence , most of the eigenfunctions are equal to zero at the origin . as is demonstrated in sec .  [",
    "sec : interactionlagrangian ] , the couplings of the kk modes to sm fields are proportional to the modulus squared of the eigenfunctions , evaluated at the position of the brane .",
    "thus , for the most symmetric location of the brane , at @xmath115 , only the @xmath116 modes couple to sm fields . in this case , it is not possible to probe the extra dimensions with the methods that are investigated in this paper , as is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : numericalanalysisofsignals ] .",
    "if the parameter @xmath105 is restricted to real values , then the relation implies that the spectrum is restricted to the interval @xmath117 .",

    "nevertheless , we assume in the remainder of this paper that the kk spectrum lies in the interval @xmath117 .",

    "since it is not possible to obtain the kk spectrum of the graviton analytically , we have used a combination of numerical calculations and weyl s asymptotic formula , as well as the form of the approximate solutions obtained by using the wkb approximation .",
    "we assume that there are no zeros of the derivative of @xmath174 for @xmath155 .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath162 , this means that any allowed value of @xmath105 has to be such as to fulfill the relation @xmath175 where @xmath176 .    performing the numerical calculations , we have found that the spectrum increases logarithmically for small @xmath177 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath178 . comparing it with the result of weyl s asymptotic formula , which increases as @xmath179",
    ", it is in fact nearly constant at @xmath180 .",
    "this is expected , since the spectrum from weyl s formula starts out at @xmath118 , while the true spectrum starts out at the non - zero value @xmath181 .",
    "hence , the true spectrum has to increase slower than the approximate formula in order for the two results to converge for large @xmath67 .",
    "we have not been able to solve numerically for the spectrum up to values where the two results converge .",
    "instead , we have resorted to solving numerically only for a manageable number , @xmath182 , of eigenvalues and extrapolating these results up to a point where weyl s formula is supposed to hold .",
    "this point is taken as the intersection between the extrapolated results from the numerical solution and the result from weyl s formula .",
    "since the spectrum is nearly constant at @xmath183 in the lower regime , our final result is @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the heaviside step function .",
    "in order to study interactions between the kk modes of the graviton and the sm fields , we need the interaction terms in the action . in the general case",
    "when @xmath186 , the higher - dimensional coupling between gravity and the sm fields to first order in @xmath187 is given by @xmath188 because of the confinement of the sm fields to the brane at @xmath189 , the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath190 ( no summation ) , where @xmath191 is the dirac delta function and @xmath192 is the ordinary sm energy - momentum tensor . inserting this expression into eq .",
    "and using the kk expansion yields the individual interaction terms @xmath193 where we have explicitly displayed the normalization of @xmath136 . using the relation @xmath31 ,",
    "these interaction terms can be rewritten as @xmath194 where @xmath195 which are dimensionless numbers characterizing the coupling strengths . in",
    "the add model , the corresponding constants @xmath196 are unimodular , and hence , they do not affect any physical results . in our model , the numbers",
    "@xmath197 are generally not unimodular , which has the results that different kk modes have different coupling strengths and that these coupling strengths depend on the position of the brane in the internal space .",
    "however , note that the angular parts of the eigenfunctions , @xmath198 , are still unimodular , and thus , @xmath197 only depends on the radial position of the brane and not on the angular position . from the above discussion , it follows that the constants @xmath197 provide a parametrization of the difference between the add model and the hyperbolic disc model in the coupling strengths of the individual kk modes .",
    "since the interaction terms in the action differ from those in the add model only by the constant factors @xmath197 , the feynman rules for the hyperbolic disc model are the same as those for the add model , except that the vertex factors involving kk modes of the graviton are multiplied by these same factors .",
    "the feynman rules for the add model are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and since our normalization convention agrees with theirs , the results can be used to obtain the feynman rules for the hyperbolic disc model .",
    "note , though , that their results are expressed in terms of the quantity @xmath199 , which is related to @xmath30 as @xmath200 .    since the amplitudes for processes involving kk modes of the graviton are suppressed by the planck scale , the cross sections for production of a single kk mode are extremely low . however , at sufficiently high energies , a large number @xmath201 of kk modes are kinematically available .",
    "the cross sections for production of any available kk mode are suppressed only by powers of the higher - dimensional gravitational mass scale @xmath30 , which could be significantly smaller than the ordinary planck scale .",
    "once produced , a kk mode is extremely weakly interacting and consequently it appears as missing energy in detectors .",
    "the cross section for production of any kk mode is obtained by summing over the kinematically available individual cross sections , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are the usual mandelstam variables . the standard way to treat this sum is to observe that the mass splittings are small in relation to any other relevant mass scale . in the add model ,",
    "the mass splittings are @xmath205 , while in our model , the mass splittings are @xmath206 , which is small for the regions of the parameter space that we consider .",
    "thus , the sum can be approximated to good accuracy by an integral , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the density of states for the kk modes . using the approximate expression for the spectrum given in eq .  , the density of states is @xmath209    there is a technical problem related to the evaluation of the integral . while the differential cross section @xmath210 and the density of states @xmath208 are given as functions of @xmath177 , the constants @xmath197 are only available as functions of the kk indices @xmath105 and @xmath162 , and we have no analytic relation between these quantities .",
    "hence , in order to evaluate the integral , we need to numerically translate the constants into functions of @xmath177 .",
    "this can be done by averaging @xmath197 over the allowed values of @xmath162 for each value of @xmath105 , and using the relation to express @xmath105 in terms of @xmath177 . from eq .",
    ", it follows that , for fixed @xmath105 , @xmath162 is restricted to the interval @xmath211 $ ] , where @xmath212 .",
    "now , in order to perform the averaging , an estimate of the density of eigenvalues for given @xmath105 and @xmath162 is needed .",
    "the approximate eigenfunctions that we employ consist of a decaying factor and an oscillating factor @xmath213 $ ] . since the eigenvalues are determined by the positions of the zeros of @xmath214 as a function of @xmath105 , we consider the eigenfunctions evaluated at the position of the brane , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath215 .",
    "in addition , since @xmath149 $ ] is a slowly varying function of @xmath105 and @xmath162 , we may locally consider the oscillating factor , seen as a function of @xmath105 , to have a well - defined wave number equal to @xmath216 .",
    "thus , the density of zeros of @xmath217 as a function of @xmath105 is approximately proportional to @xmath216 .",
    "we are interested in the zeros of the derivative @xmath214 , and we assume that there is exactly one such zero between each pair of zeros of @xmath217 .",

    "cross sections for such processes are calculated using the parton model .",

    "all of our results are presented for @xmath244 .",
    "since we consider high - energy processes , the partons are approximated as being massless .",
    "as there are massless particles in the final states in both of the processes that we study , the expressions for the cross sections suffer from collinear divergences in the limit of zero transverse momentum of these particles . in order to avoid these singularities",

    "almost all of the contributions to the cross sections come from subprocesses with an effective center - of - mass energy lower than the fundamental mass scale , and hence , these results can be trusted .",
    "these regions depend on the chosen set of parameters , and differ between jet and photon reactions . in general , the results become better for higher @xmath30 , but at the same time the cross sections decrease . hence , we need to make a trade - off between these two competing effects .    as discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : thehyperbolicdiscmodel ] , in the case that the brane is positioned at the center of the disc , only the @xmath116 kk modes couple to the sm fields .",
