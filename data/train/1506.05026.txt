    "famous rogers - ramanujan identities are two analytic identities , for @xmath5 or @xmath6 , @xmath7 if , for @xmath5 , we expand both sides in taylor series , then the coefficient of @xmath8 obtained from the product side can be interpreted as a number of partitions of @xmath9 with parts congruent @xmath10 . on the other side , the coefficient of @xmath8 obtained from the sum side can be interpreted as a number of partitions of @xmath9 such that a difference between two consecutive parts is at least two .",
    "we can write a partition as @xmath11 meaning that the part @xmath12 appears @xmath13 times in the partition , and @xmath14 for all but finitely many @xmath12 . with this notation",
    "the difference two condition between two consecutive parts can be written as @xmath15 and two ways of expressing the coefficient of @xmath8 in taylor series of ( [ e : analytic rr ] ) can be stated as combinatorial rogers - ramanujan identity @xmath16 analytic rogers - ramanujan identities have gordon - andrews - bressoud s generalization ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these identities also have a combinatorial interpretation , but in general it is not so easy to interpret sum sides of analytic identities as generating functions for a number of partitions satisfying certain difference conditions among parts .    in 1980 s rogers - ramanujan - type identities appeared in statistical physics and in representation theory of affine kac - moody lie algebras .",
    "this led to two lines of intensive research and numerous generalizations of both analytic and combinatorial identities , the reader may consult , for example , the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "j. lepowsky and s. milne discovered in @xcite that the product sides of gordon - andrews - bressoud identities , multiplied with certain fudge factor @xmath17 , are principally specialized characters of standard modules for affine lie algebra @xmath18 .",
    "lepowsky and r. l. wilson realized that the factor @xmath17 is a character of the fock space for the principal heisenberg subalgebra of @xmath18 , and that the sum sides of gordon - andrews - bressoud identities are the principally specialized characters of the vacuum spaces of standard modules for the action of principal heisenberg subalgebra . in a series of papers ",
    "see @xcite and the references therein  lepowsky and wilson discovered vertex operators in the principal picture on standard @xmath18-modules and constructed bases of vacuum spaces for the principal heisenberg subalgebra parametrized by partitions satisfying certain difference 2 conditions .",
    "very roughly speaking , in the rogers - ramanujan case , the vacuum space @xmath19 is spanned by monomial vectors of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a highest weight vector and @xmath22 are certain @xmath23-operators .",
    "the degree of monomial vector ( [ e : lw argument 1 ] ) is @xmath24 since @xmath23-operators @xmath22 on @xmath19 satisfy certain relations , roughly of the form @xmath25 ( see @xcite and @xcite for precise formulation ) , we may replace the _",
    "leading terms _ @xmath26 of relations ( [ e : lw relations ] ) with `` higher terms '' @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and reduce the spanning set ( [ e : lw argument 1 ] ) of @xmath19 to a spanning set @xmath30 by invoking the product formula for principally specialized character of @xmath19 and rogers - ramanujan identities , we see that vectors in the spanning set ( [ e : lw argument 4 ] ) are in fact a basis of @xmath19 .",
    "in such a way gordon - andrews - bressoud identities also appear for low level representations of different affine lie algebras or for representations of low rank affine lie algebras ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite ) , and s. capparelli has found new combinatorial identities ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the analogous construction in the homogeneous picture is obtained in @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper are closely related to a similar construction of combinatorial bases for standard @xmath18-modules obtained in @xcite and @xcite by a. meurman and the first author , and independently in @xcite by b. feigin , r. kedem , s. loktev , t. miwa and e. mukhin .",
    "the starting point is a basis of @xmath18 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the standard basis of @xmath33 , and the corresponding poincar ' e - birkhoff - witt monomial spanning set of level @xmath0 standard @xmath18-module @xmath34 @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the spanning set ( [ e : mp argument 2 ] ) is analogous to the spanning set ( [ e : lw argument 1 ] ) .",
    "we have a relation @xmath37 with the leading term @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this is analogous to ( [ e : lw relations ] ) and ( [ e : lw argument 3 ] ) , and we can reduce the spanning set ( [ e : mp argument 2 ] ) to a smaller spanning set satisfying the difference condition @xmath41 but this spanning set is not a basis of @xmath34 .",
    "all the relations needed to reduce ( [ e : mp argument 2 ] ) to a basis of @xmath34 are obtained from ( [ e : mp argument 3 ] ) by the adjoint action of @xmath33 , and all the leading terms are obtained by the adjoint action of @xmath33 on ( [ e : mp argument 4 ] ) @xmath42 ( see ( [ e:12.16 ] ) bellow ) . by using these relations and their leading terms we can reduce a spanning set ( [ e : mp argument 2 ] ) to a smaller spanning set of @xmath34 satisfying the difference conditions @xmath43 in @xcite and @xcite it is proved , by different methods , that this spanning set is a basis of @xmath34 .",
    "this is analogous to difference conditions for the basis ( [ e : lw argument 4 ] ) .",
    "the degree of monomial vector ( [ e : mp argument 2 ] ) satisfying the difference conditions ( [ e : mp argument 6 ] ) is @xmath44 so we are naturally led to interpret monomial basis vectors ( [ e : mp argument 2 ] ) in terms of colored partitions with parts @xmath12 in three colors : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( cf .",

    "we can write the leading term of a relation  in our example it is the monomial @xmath63 this monomial is the leading term of some relation for @xmath64 i.e. , for standard module @xmath65 . by using these relations and their leading terms we can reduce a pbw - spanning set @xmath66 of @xmath34 to a smaller spanning set satisfying difference conditions @xmath67 for any two cascades as above .",
    "_ we conjecture that this spanning set is in fact a basis . _",
    "if we interpret @xmath33 as type @xmath68 lie algebra , then our list of leading terms coincides with ( [ e : mp argument 5 ] ) , and our difference conditions ( [ e : cn argument 1 ] ) coincide with difference conditions ( [ e : mp argument 6 ] ) , so by @xcite and @xcite the spanning set is a basis . for level @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "the spanning set is a basis by @xcite , and we show in that the spanning set is a basis for @xmath69 and all @xmath2 .",
    "these are the only cases in which our conjecture is proved .",
    "numerical evidence supports our conjecture in the case @xmath71 ( see example 7.1 in the last section ) .",
    "it took us quite a while to understand the combinatorial parametrization of leading terms even for the @xmath72 type affine lie algebra  in level one case i. siladi ' c enumerated leading terms by using a computer .",
    "g. trupevi ' c in @xcite first encountered the `` combinatorics of cascades '' in his construction of combinatorial bases of the feigin - stoyanovsky type subspaces of standard modules for affine lie algebras @xmath73 , a very special case of which are the `` admissible configurations '' in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite combinatorial bases of the feigin - stoyanovsky type subspaces of all standard modules for affine lie algebras of type @xmath74 were constructed .",

    "for example , @xmath447 we visualize this calculations by representing monomials @xmath448 as multiple points in two copies of triangle @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath449 and by representing the action of @xmath450 with an arrow which moves the points from the place @xmath451 to the place @xmath452 , and from the place @xmath452 to the place @xmath453 . then we can simplify and visualize previous calculation without explicitly keeping track of coefficients : after applying one arrow on @xmath454 we obtain two terms by acting on two different factors @xmath455 and the first monomial is smaller because in our reverse lexicographical order we compare parts from the right to the left @xmath456 now we act with the second arrow on each of these monomials  from the first monomial we obtain three terms @xmath457 and from the second monomial we obtain another three terms @xmath458 the smallest term is the very first monomial @xmath459 and we see that our guiding `` principle '' should be : _ act with an arrow on the largest part of the smallest colored partition to obtain the smallest term_. in general we obtain all leading terms ( [ e:12.16 ] ) in the following way : first for @xmath460 we act with @xmath90 arrows on @xmath461 and , acting always on the largest possible part @xmath462 , we get @xmath463 with @xmath464 the smallest possible part to act on is @xmath465 and with additional @xmath466 arrows , @xmath467 , we get @xmath468 once we have obtained a factor @xmath469 , the smallest part the arrow can act on nontrivially is @xmath470 , and we proceed with changing the left triangle .",
    "essentially the same procedure used for @xmath471 can be used for @xmath83 of type @xmath50 , @xmath2 , a difference being in a use of different `` kinds '' of arrows acting on @xmath472 for example , by applying @xmath473 arrows @xmath279 $ ] to the factor @xmath474 we get @xmath475 .",
    "we visualize this step as moving @xmath476 points from the place @xmath307 to the place @xmath477 by using @xmath476 arrows @xmath279 $ ] , and after that by using another @xmath476 arrows @xmath279 $ ] we move @xmath476 points from the place @xmath477 to the place @xmath478 in the second row ( see lemma [ l : arrows 6 ] ) .",
    "any additional @xmath279 $ ] arrow will act trivially on monomial @xmath475 and will move points corresponding to the factor @xmath479 .",
