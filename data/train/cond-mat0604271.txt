    "nonequilibrium models with phase transitions into absorbing states arise in studies of biological populations , chemical reactions , spreading of diseases , and many other  @xcite .",
    "an absorbing phase is a subspace of states that can be reached but not be left by the dynamics . in biologically motivated models absorbing phases occur whenever a system reaches a configuration or a dynamical state from where it can not escape . in many cases an absorbing state",
    "is characterized by a complete loss of activity .",
    "it is believed that phase transitions into an absorbing state generically belong to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class  @xcite .",
    "dp is extremely robust and includes even models with several species of particles  @xcite and infinitely many absorbing states  @xcite .",
    "exceptions from dp are usually observed in models with long - range interactions , quenched randomness , and non - conventional symmetries such as a @xmath1-symmetry or conservation of particle number .    in models with several species of particles and several absorbing states , there exist in addition to transitions where one species goes extinct , multicritical points where several reduced control parameters vanish simultaneously .",
    "such multicritical points are characterized by a hierarchy of order parameter exponents with only one of them being the dp exponent , and by a crossover exponent @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "again , the multicritical behavior is different in the presence of symmetries  @xcite .",
    "most dp models have in common that active sites may become inactive at a certain rate , i.e. particles can disappear spontaneously .",
    "but even models with a different mechanism for particle removal may belong to the dp class . for example",
    ", in branching and annihilating random walks particles can only annihilate pairwise , leading to an algebraic decay in the subcritical phase . until recently , it was believed that such models do not show a dp - like phase transition in dimensions larger than two .",
    "however , as has been shown by canet _",
    "@xcite , in higher dimensions such transitions occur also , but only beyond a minimum annihilation rate , so that freshly produced offspring can annihilate with its parent with a sufficiently large probability before diffusing away .    in this article",
    ", we consider a two - species model , which is inspired by biology .",
    "a special feature of this model is that one of the two species ( denoted as @xmath3 ) can not vanish spontaneously , instead it can only be destroyed by the other one ( called @xmath4 ) . in one dimension",
    "it turns out that the two species can not coexist and the phase transition is discontinuous for the first species . in higher dimensions",
    "the two species can coexist in a certain region of the phase diagram , giving rise to three different phases .",
    "we find numerically that all phase boundaries where one species becomes extinct , are in the dp class , while the multicritical point where the two critical lines meet , shows a more complex scaling behavior . near the multicritical point",
    ", the critical region becomes very small , and therefore the dp behavior can hardly be seen in numerical simulations .",
    "we apply numerical studies as well as mean - field calculations and scaling arguments .",
    "in addition to the stationary state , we also investigate the dynamical behavior starting from a random initial state .",
    "we find that two different scaling forms are needed to describe different dynamical regimes .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the next section , we motivate and define our model . in section  [ sec : mf ] we formulate a mean field theory and discuss the corresponding phase diagram . numerical simulations in one and two spatial dimensions are presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] . in section  [ sec : scaling ] we suggest phenomenological scaling theory for the dynamical and the stationary regimes .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the model is defined on a @xmath5-dimensional hypercubic lattice with @xmath6 sites .",
    "each lattice site is occupied either by species @xmath4 , or by species @xmath3 , or it is empty .",

    "* a site occupied by species @xmath4 turns into an empty site with rate @xmath9 .",

    "the two species can not coexist in the same patch , and therefore each patch is occupied at most by one of the two species  @xcite .",
    "species @xmath4 has the higher fitness and therefore displaces species @xmath3 when it enters a patch occupied by @xmath3 .",
    "however , species @xmath4 has a certain risk of dying out in a patch , for instance because it can not respond well to adverse circumstances , such as illness or extreme weather conditions . @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath3 may stand for an asexual and a sexual species , for instance oribatid mites in the soil  @xcite , or ostracods in ponds lakes  @xcite , where asexual and sexual species are known to have coexisted for a long time .",
    "asexual species have a higher reproduction rate , but can accumulate deleterious mutations  @xcite , which reduce their fitness below that of the sexual variant .    in our model",
    "the dynamics of species @xmath4 is not affected by the presence of @xmath3 since empty sites and sites occupied by @xmath3 can both be conquered by @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics of species @xmath4 is therefore a version of dp , and the phase transition of species @xmath4 to extinction is in the dp universality class .",
    "more specifically , the dynamic rules of the @xmath4 s are equivalent to those of a so - called contact process  @xcite , which is a well - studied lattice model of dp with random - sequential updates .",

    "thus , matching initial decay and subsequent growth this second crossover time has to scale as @xmath136 therefore , in finite dimensions the two crossover times @xmath137 and @xmath134 scale _ differently _ with respect to @xmath25 which explains the necessity of two separate scaling forms .",
    "the exponents @xmath115 and @xmath116 for the crossover from regime ii to regime iii can be determined as follows . on the one hand , the density @xmath19 saturates at the value @xmath94 for @xmath138 on the vertical phase transition line , independent of @xmath25 , implying that @xmath139 on the other hand , scale invariance of the argument of the scaling function in eq .",
    "( [ scalingform ] ) requires that @xmath140 therefore , the resulting scaling form reads : @xmath141 this scaling form can be verified numerically by a data collapse along the vertical transition line , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling]e . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling]f we demonstrate that this data collapse works not only at the vertical transition line but also along the curved phase transition line .",
    "since the dp - like decay of @xmath19 is expected to set in when @xmath17 becomes stationary , i.e. , at time @xmath142 , it follows that the two time scales , namely , the dp correlation time @xmath143 and the second crossover time @xmath144 become identical on the curved critical line .",
    "more specifically , the phase transition line is expected to be characterized by a constant value of the scale - invariant combination @xmath145 , hence @xmath146 inserting the numerical estimates @xmath147 and @xmath92 we obtain @xmath148 in fair agreement with the numerically extrapolated value in sect .",
    "[ phasetransitionline ] .    for large times , the expression ( [ scalingform2 ] ) for",
    "@xmath19 must approach an asymptotic value that is independent of time .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath149 this implies that lines of constant density in the @xmath25-@xmath24-plane are given by constant ratios @xmath150 .",
    "as we have mentioned , the scaling relation ( [ scalingrelation ] ) implies that the dp - like decay of species @xmath3 sets in only after its density has increased to a considerable value . at this time species",
    "@xmath3 has lost the memory of its past , and its dynamics is essentially determined by species @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the time evolution @xmath36 is from then on identical to the one obtained starting the simulation with a stationary @xmath17 and with a finite and random occupation with @xmath3 . this conclusion is supported by comparing the two simulations , as shown in fig .  [ stationary ] .",
    "f , but with time measured in units of @xmath143 on the horizontal axis .",
    "right panel : simulation with the same parameters , but with a stationary initial distribution of @xmath4 particles .",
    "[ stationary],width=321 ]    -5 mm    the range of the axes is the same in both panels , and one can clearly see that for sufficiently large times the two types of curves agree .",
    "this agreement of the large - time behavior for the two different types of initial conditions occurs also in the mean - field theory , as mentioned at the end of section [ sec : mf ] .",
    "finally let us study the asymptotic critical behavior of @xmath19 in the vicinity of the curved phase transition line .",
    "close to the multicritical point we have shown that this line can be parametrized by @xmath151 where @xmath152 is non - universal metric factor .",
    "on the curved line the density @xmath36 decays asymptotically as @xmath97 , i.e. , as in a critical dp process . slightly above in the coexistence phase",
    ", @xmath36 will eventually saturate at a value proportional to @xmath153 , where @xmath154 denotes again the vertical distance from the line .",
    "this means that in addition to the previously discussed invariance under the transformation @xmath155 the system _ simultaneously _ has to be invariant under the dp - like scale transformation @xmath156 with another scale factor @xmath157 independent of @xmath158 .",
    "the second type of scale invariance further constraints the form of @xmath159 , effectively reducing the number of independent arguments in the corresponding scaling form to  1 . to see this it is convenient to switch from the parameters @xmath27 to the parameters @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the normalized distance from the critical line . in terms of these new parameters , the scaling form ( [ scalingform2 ] )",
    "is expressed equivalently as @xmath162 where @xmath163 .",
    "obviously , the parameter @xmath164 is invariant under the first type of scale transformation  ( [ scalingtype1 ] ) while it scales as @xmath165 under the second type of scale transformations ( [ scalingtype2 ] ) .",
    "applying the latter to the scaling form  ( [ newscalingform2 ] ) yields @xmath166 setting @xmath167 one obtains @xmath168 in fact , the argument @xmath169 is a scale - invariant ratio under _ both _",
    "types of scale transformations , proving that the off - critical dp - process of species @xmath4 and the almost - critical dp - process of species @xmath3 can be described in terms of a unified scaling theory .",
    "we emphasize that this scaling form is valid _ only _ in the temporal regime iii close to the curved phase transition line , where @xmath170 .",
    "the scaling form ( [ finalnewscalingform ] ) reproduces the expected dp behavior .",
    "initially the system does not yet feel the influence of @xmath164 , hence @xmath171 for small @xmath172 .",
    "later , for @xmath173 , the initial dp - like decay of @xmath19 crosses over to a stationary value , meaning that for large arguments @xmath174 becomes constant .",
    "hence @xmath19 evolves as @xmath175 \\delta_s^\\beta & \\mbox { for } \\,\\,\\ , t/\\xi_\\parallel \\gg \\delta_s^{-\\nu_\\parallel}\\ , , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the stationary correlation length of species @xmath4 .",
    "exactly on the curved transition line , we have @xmath176 , and @xmath19 therefore decays forever . the unit time is set by @xmath177 , which is the life time of the largest voids of the @xmath4-process .",
    "close to the curved transition line , a decay of @xmath19 with @xmath97 occurs only if the time scale for saturation , @xmath178 is larger than the crossover time @xmath134 , implying @xmath179 , or , equivalently , @xmath170 .",
    "otherwise , as we have already mentioned , the scaling form ( [ finalnewscalingform ] ) is not valid , and saturation sets in directly after the growth in regime ii , without dp - like decay of @xmath19 .    finally , let us compare the results once more to mean - field theory . in mean - field theory , the two crossover times scale in the same way , making the distinction between two different scaling forms unnecessary and removing the intermediate growth in regime ii close to the critical line , where the dp - like decay of @xmath19 becomes visible .",
    "the values of the exponents are in mean - field theory @xmath180 .",
    "the behavior in regime iii near the critical line that we found in mean - field theory resembles qualitatively the one described in this section . in particular",
    ", the proportionality factor between @xmath19 and @xmath181 diverges at the multicritical point , and so does the factor in front of the @xmath97 decay .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a simple model of two competing species @xmath4 and @xmath3 feeding on the same resources and living in `` patches '' represented by lattice sites .",
    "species @xmath4 is characterized by fast reproduction and can therefore displace species @xmath3 and evolves independently according to the dynamic rules of a contact process . hence it belongs to the universality class of directed percolation .",
    "special @xmath3 has a lower reproduction rate and is therefore restricted to live in those patches where @xmath4 is absent .",
    "in contrast to species @xmath4 , which can die out in a patch , patches occupied by species @xmath3 do not become empty spontaneously .",
    "in one spatial dimension , the phase diagram comprises two different phases where one of the species goes extinct , separated by a first - order transition line . in higher dimensions",
    "an additional mixed phase emerges , bounded by two continuous transition lines .",
    "this mixed phase is characterized by a non - trivial coexistence of the two species in the stationary state . sites ) , one can generate a modified version of the model where the two species can coexist even in one dimension , and where the phase transition of @xmath3 is also continuous . ]    the curved phase transition line ( except for the multicritical point ) is found to belong to the dp universality class .",
    "this result may be surprising because @xmath3-individuals do not vanish spontaneously .",
    "on the other hand the result is also plausible since species @xmath3 ` percolates ' in the voids of the _ supercritical _ dp of species @xmath4 . since the spatio - temporal arrangement of species @xmath4 involves only short - range correlations these voids are uncorrelated on large scales , which effectively leads to a dp transition .",
    "at the multicritical point the correlation lengths of the @xmath4-process diverges , leading to a non - trivial scaling behavior . in this case , starting with a mixed random initial conditions , @xmath3-occupied patches mark those lattice sites that have been never visited by a species @xmath4 before . therefore",
    ", the density @xmath19 decays in the same way as the so - called local persistence probability in dp . for @xmath62 , however , this decay crosses over to an increase of @xmath19 when the reproduction of @xmath3 becomes visible .",
    "this increase continues until a stationary state is reached in which the two species coexist if the parameters are not too close to the curved phase transition line .",
    "close to the curved phase transition line , @xmath19 decreases again after times long enough that @xmath17 has become stationary and saturates eventually at a small nonzero value depending on the distance to the critical line .",
    "we succeeded in introducing scaling variables and scaling functions that characterize the behavior of @xmath19 in the different regimes ."
