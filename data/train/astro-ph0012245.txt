    "we have previously reported broad - band ( jhk ) imaging observations of qsos of redshift 0.9 to 4.2 at resolutions @xmath10.2 arcsec ( hutchings et al 1999 : paper 1 ) , which indicated extended or tidal structures in most of them .",
    "we also reported finding that the radio - loud qsos appear to live in dense environments of small companion galaxies whose colours suggest young stellar populations .",
    "these earlier data , like those reported here , were taken with the pueo adaptive optics system of the canada france hawaii telescope .",
    "this paper describes observations of qsos made with the same system using nir narrow band filters to isolate the emission from the lines of [ o  iii ] , and h@xmath0 at the redshift of the qsos .",
    "the idea is to study the morphology of emission line gas in and around the qsos , and possibly to detect such emission from associated galaxies .",
    "thus , this investigation studies the gas in the environment of high redshift qsos , rather than the stellar content seen in the continuum imaging previously reported .",
    "it is known in low redshift qsos that extended emission line gas is seen in and even beyond the stellar population , and is evidence for stripping of gas in galaxy collisions , and illumination by the active nucleus ( boroson , persson , and oke 1985 , stockton and mackenty 1987 ) .",
    "our new data necessarily include broad - band images for continuum removal , and we use these to further discuss the stellar populations of the qso and probable neighbours .    the observing progam is heavily constrained by practical considerations .",
    "first , using the existing narrow - band filters , only certain lines at certain redshifts can be observed .",
    "second , as in all programs with the camera , only qsos with a bright guide star nearby can be observed .",
    "third , the filter wheel for the observing run can not hold all available filters , so further downselection is generally needed .",
    "finally , the qsos observable depended on the scheduled dates of observation .",
    "the observations were made on two nights in january 2000 , and the above constraints left us with 12 targets for emission line imaging .",
    "their distribution around the sky allowed good observations to be made of 5 of these , and broad - band imaging was performed for a further one which had not previously been observed .",
    "the result is that while we obtained good data on the objects , the sample finally observed had very little latitude for selection by properties such as redshift , luminosity , or radio emission .",
    "nevertheless , a reasonable range of redshifts and radio characteristics was achieved .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observations .",
    "the objects were observed with the narrow band filter that contains the emission line , and also with the broad - band filter most appropriate for continuum subtraction .",
    "the narrow - band filters used have bandwidths of 150 - 200a , and qso redshifts were selected to place the emission lines well within this - in all cases within the fwhm of the roughly gaussian bandpass . in velocity ,",
    "our filters correspond to rest wavelength ranges of 2000 to 4600 km.s@xmath2 , and in all cases , we observe emission within 650 km.s@xmath2 of ( and up to 2000 km.s@xmath2 from ) the qso redshift .",
    "table 1 lists the filter central wavelengths .",
    "each set of observations was carried out as a series of 200 - 300 sec exposures in broad - band and 600 sec exposures in narrow - band .",
    "these were generally executed as a set of dithered exposures marking a square of about 7 arcsec side , sometimes with one in the centre .",
    "each observation set also included one or more short exposures of the guide star in the same positions on the detector , to be used as psf data .",
    "photometric standard stars were observed with the broad - band and one of the narrow - band filters as a check on the continuum subtractions .",
    "the weather was clear on most of both nights , but the image quality was significantly superior on the second night . in some objects , data from night one were found not to add information to the subset of data from night 2 .",
    "table 1 lists details including image quality and sky brightness during the observing run .    in the sections below",
    ", we discuss the objects and the observations on each in turn .",
    "the data were processed in standard ways , as described in paper 1 , using the dithered science exposures to create a sky image . where there was a bright guide star in the frame ,",
    "the bright signal pixels were masked out when creating the median sky frame .",
    "the final images were derived by subtracting the mean sky image derived in this way , for the filter used .",
    "these were then averaged with sigma clipping after being shifted to remove the dither offsets .",
    "the shifts were measured from centroids of bright objects in the images .",
    "there are several ways to estimate the scaling to apply between the broad and narrow band filter images , for continuum removal . in order of increasing reliability , these include measuring the signal rates from dome flat exposures , calculating the relative throughput from the bandpasses and filter transmissions , observations of standard or guide stars , and measurements of stars or foreground galaxies in the final science images .",
    "we did not obtain bright star exposures for all the filters , but the science images contained objects that were seen in both filters in all cases . in the sections below , we comment on the process as it applied in the different cases . in all cases ,",
    "the continuum and narrow - band images were obtained close in time , on the same night , to minimise changes in seeing and image correction from the ao system . where observations were obtained on both nights , continuum and narrow - band images",
    "were processed before being combined or compared .",
    "thus , psf modelling and subtraction are not a critical part of the emission line results reported .",
    "we did additionally perform some psf - subtraction , mainly in the broad - band qso images .",
    "in general , this process involves matching the qso psf by using a short exposure on the guide star , which is then smoothed and scaled so that the nucleus is still the brightest part of the result .",
    "detailed modelling of the degradation of the psf with angle from the guide star ( see hutchings et al 1998 ) was not attempted , since it is not adequately calibrated by the exposures in this program , which was aimed at the narrow - band imaging .",
    "we discuss each case individually below . in individual sections",
    "below , we also comment on objects that have intrinsic blue colours . by this , we mean that rest wavelength colours can arise only from a young population of stars , dominated by spectral types o and b. the qso broad - band magnitudes are accurate to 0.1 m , from the photometric calibration and expected photon errors .",
    "table 2 summarizes the principal results from all program objects , described in detail in the following sections .",
    "this qso at z = 1.52 is a compact flat spectrum radio source with flux about 500 mjy ( preston et al 1985 , neff et al 1989 ) , and our vla a - configuration 5 ghz map from the latter paper shows no structure .",
    "the visible magnitude is 19.0 and wright et al ( 1983 ) give j magnitude 17.7 and k magnitude 16.1 .",
    "the field was observed in h band and a nearby narrow - band filter which includes the redshifted h@xmath0 . while the field was observed on both nights , the images from night 1 were the worst of the run , and those from night 2 were 3 times sharper in fwhm .",
    "thus , almost all our information comes from the second night s data .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the images of this qso .",
    "the qso is clearly resolved in our images ( see profile plots in figure 3 ) .",
    "the qso also has a slightly curved narrow jet - like extension , seen clearly in the broad - band image at position angle @xmath1 - 120@xmath3 .",
    "the narrow - band image has a sharper linear feature closer in to the nucleus , with similar position angle ( @xmath1 - 135@xmath3 ) . while narrow , this feature has fwhm close to the psf , and its ridge extends along several pixels . in both the raw and psf - subtracted images ,",
    "the continuum feature appears separated from the central object .",
    "the h - band feature is visible out to some 0.6 `` from the qso , while the narrow - band feature is seen within 0.15 '' of the nucleus .",
    "we measure the qso h band magnitude as 17.1 , which is consistent with the j and k band values quoted above .",
    "in addition to the jet - like features , the emission line image has asymmetrical extended flux to the nw and the s while the h band image is more nearly azimuthally symmetrical .",
    "the psf - subtracted h band image shows extension along the ne - sw direction on both sides of the nucleus , with the ` jet ' being part of this structure . the jet feature may not connect with the main host galaxy in the subtracted image , and thus might be a tidally extended companion being accreted .",
    "these results are robust to all feasible psf scaling factors in the subtraction , as the features lie well outside the central psf .",
    "the total flux of the host galaxy thus derived is 1/7 of the total , which corresponds to a luminosity of m@xmath4 -24.6 for the host galaxy , including the outer extended regions .",
    "the emission line equivalent width ( @xmath5 plus [ n ii ] ) is 300a from the resolved narrow - band flux .",
    "the field around the qso has a few faint objects in it , with a range of sizes and fluxes . aside from the guide star ,",
    "there is a star of comparable brightness to the qso , a nucleated round galaxy , a faint diffuse galaxy , and 3 resolved objects within about 2 arcsec of the qso .",
    "what we have found for this qso is that it is resolved in both continuum and line emission .",
    "the h band resolved light extends over one arcsec and is elongated about the nucleus , including the linear feature seen in the raw image .",
    "this ` host galaxy ' flux corresponds to a luminous galaxy at the qso redshift .",
    "the h@xmath0 line emission is less extended but also suggests a narrow feature within the host galaxy , and more diffuse light that spreads orthogonal to the host galaxy .",
    "we speculate that the host galaxy is linear , or edge - on , possibly merging , and undergoing a burst of star - formation which is visible as h@xmath0 emission in material blown away from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the unresolved nuclear radio source suggests the qso event is relatively young : see neff and hutchings ( 1990 ) for an overview of radio quasar evolution with redshift .",
    "this qso was studied in paper 1 in k band , with the same instrumentation .",
    "it was reobserved this time in h band and a narrow - band filter to include redshifted [ o  iii ] . as we noted in our earlier paper ,",
    "the qso lies in a rich field of objects that could be companions .",
    "the qso is a compact ghz - peaked radio source ( odea et al 1990 ) , which is just resolved as a vlbi source ( schilizzi and shaver 1981 ) , with a halo of major axis of pa 110@xmath3 to 70@xmath3 . at higher frequencies the source is better resolved and may be undergoing superluminal expansion .",
    "the radio source is powerful and is considered to show synchrotron self - absorption and radio recombination lines ( bell et al 1984 ) .",
    "all these properties suggest the source is immersed in a dense local medium and probably young .    in paper 1",
    "we noted the high density of companions likely to be associated with this qso .",
    "thus , objects in the field may also have [ o  iii ] emission in the narrow passband , and may not be relied on to define the null ratio of narrow and broad - band signals .",
    "the filter passbands and throughput values indicate that the ratio in our images should be 0.09 or less . of the 6 objects with measurable narrow band signal , four have values near 0.07 , so we have adopted this as the null ratio .",
    "the qso ( plus host ) has a value of 0.092 , which indicates an equivalent width of [ o  iii ] of 35a .",
    "the other object measured in the nb field has a value of 0.11 ( ew=40a ) , and may indeed be an emission - line galaxy at the qso redshift .",
    "this object lies some 15 \" to the nw of the qso .",
    "uncertainties in the above measures amount to 1@xmath6 errors in ew of some 5a , based purely on the difference in the broad to narrow band image fluxes .",
    "the continuum - subtracted [ o  iii ] image shows an elongated structure on both sides of the nucleus with position angle very close to that of the vlbi radio source(s ) ( see figures 1 and 4 ) .",
    "note that the closely spaced contours near the nucleus arise from some psf mismatch near the nucleus .",
    "the contours along the nw - se extensions are , however , robust to a wide range of psf scalings and locations .",
    "the emission is stronger to the nw , and is seen over a distance of about 0.5 `` . using a short exposure of the guide star as psf , the h - band image with psf",
    "subtracted shows some faint light in a broad region to the nw ( i.e. also along the axis of radio and line emission ) , that is invariant to the details of the psf subtraction .",
    "this extends to some 0.7 '' from the nucleus .",
    "the overall host galaxy light is strongly dependent on the psf scaling and modelling and lies in the range 3 to 10 times fainter than the qso .",
    "the qso is very luminous , with m@xmath4 at -30.1 ( using our cosmology parameters from paper 1 of h@xmath7=75 km.s@xmath2.mpc@xmath2 , q@xmath7=0.5 , and no k - correction ) .",
    "this means the host galaxy absolute magnitude is in the range -28 to -29 , which is also extremely luminous .",
    "the qso colour can be derived by using the measures from paper 1 .",
    "while there are minor uncertainties because of weather differences , the differences between k and k calibrations , and the possibility of variability of the qso , we find that the qso is significantly reddened .",
    "the qso is in fact the reddest object in the field .",
    "this may indicate internal dust associated with extensive star - formation , and may be the reason that the [ o iii ] equivalent width is the lowest we detect ( see table 2 ) , if the dust is patchy and associated with the emission line regions .",
    "( note that the red colour of the qso and location of the nb passband will cause us to overestimate the ew , although only at the few percent level . )",
    "this scenario is consistent with the youth and local absorption noted above from the radio observations .    the new h band images , combined with the data from paper 1 , reveal the colours of many of the nearby objects , which are of interest . our earlier k band images and the new h band ones do not overlap exactly , so it is impossible to get colours for all objects in paper 1",
    "we do see the same objects in the overlapping areas of old and new data .",
    "the colours we measure range over some 0.8 mag in h - k , and magnitudes range from 2 to 6 magnitudes fainter than the qso .",
    "all objects are compact and although the brightest may be foreground objects , the rest are unusually luminous and blue objects if they are at the qso redshift .",
    "overall , this qso may be in a central luminous galaxy of a group of compact bright galaxies .",
    "there is line emission aligned with the compact radio source that is more extended than the radio , but lies within the body of the host galaxy .",
    "it seems probable that this qso is in its early stages and lies within a reddened galaxy with considerable star - formation .",
    "it should be detectable as a source further into the infrared .",
    "this qso appears in radio source catalogues as 7c0825 + 2930 , b0825 + 295 , and j0828 + 29 .",
    "the radio flux is given as 719 mjy at 151 mhz ( 7c ) ( willott et al 1998 ) , 226 mjy at 1.4 ghz ( white and becker 1992 ) , 100 mjy at 8 ghz ( wilkinson et al 1998 ) , and 50 - 100 mjy at 5 ghz ( falco et al 1998 ) .",
    "the spectral index is given by willott et al as 0.45 , and wilkinson et al report a faint jet 1 \" long at position angle -90@xmath3 to -60@xmath3 .",
    "the optical redshift determination is reported at 2.315 by willott et al and 2.322 by falco et al .",
    "either redshift puts emission lines well within the filters used .",
    "the optical identification is not described in detail , and there are two faint compact objects within about 2 arcsec .",
    "the radio source position lies within 0.2 arcsec of the southern of the two objects .",
    "our observations show that both these objects are very compact , and their azimuthal profiles are similar in the h and k band images .",
    "figure 3 shows the h - band profiles , in which the southern object is designated qso , and it is slightly more extended than the psf and the other object . in two dimensions ,",
    "the extensions in the southern object are the same in h and k band images from both nights .",
    "subtraction of our psf profile scaled to remove the central peak leaves faint extended flux , largely to the ne , in the southern object .",
    "figures 1 , 4 and 5 show images of this qso and its companion .    the narrow band flux is larger in the southern object , in both [ o  iii ] and h@xmath0 , which confirms our identification .",
    "if the [ o  iii ] continuum subtraction from the narrow - band image is scaled to remove the northern object , the qso image has a nuclear source plus a possible extension to the ne , about 0.3 arcsec long .",
    "this subtraction is not perfect , however , since it either leaves a point source at the centre of the northern object , or oversubtracts its extended light .",
    "this probably arises from changes in the seeing between the continuum and narrow - band images : if so , it also provides a calibration of the effect , assuming there is no [ o  iii ] emission in the northern object .",
    "the scale factor that we derive this way is exactly what we expect based on the bandpasses of the two filters and exposure times used : 7.4 .",
    "however , this is not a robust result as the transparency during the observations was variable .",
    "the narrow band image that isolates h@xmath0 shows a larger difference between the two objects , but unfortunately the northern object lies on the intersection of two quadrants of the detector , so that it is not a good control for the scaling of the continuum image subtraction .",
    "however , using the value derived from the filter bandpasses and exposure times , the signal left in the northern object is within the noise level of zero , while leaving a substantial signal at the southern object .",
    "the morphology of the continuum - subtracted qso image is extended in all directions , particularly along ne - sw .",
    "we note that both [ o iii ] and h@xmath0 are extended to the w. the stronger ne extension seen in [ o  iii ] is not apparent in h@xmath0 .",
    "the excess light in the narrow - band images compared with the scaled broad - band images corresponds to equivalent widths overall of 120a in [ o  iii ] and 290a in h@xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath0 filter will also include light from the [ n ii ] nebular lines in the host galaxy .",
    "the h and k magnitudes for the qso and northern object are 17.8 , 17.3 and 17.8 , 17.8 respectively , based on our standard star data , again with the caveat that the transparency was variable .",
    "willott et al ( 1998 ) report a k magnitude of 17.55 and falco et al ( 1998 ) report i magnitude of 18.5",
    ".    the only other object in the 35 `` field , apart from the guide star , is a galaxy about 7.9 '' to the south of the qso .",
    "it is smooth and round ( like an elliptical ) of diameter some 1.5 \" , and has h and k magnitudes 18.0 and 17.5 .",
    "the close grouping and similar magnitudes of the objects detected raises the question of whether they are related .",
    "however , the galaxy is too bright to be at the qso redshift , and is certainly a foreground object , probably at redshift 0.5 or lower from its magnitude , colour , and size .",
    "the unresolved nature , colour , and lack of line emission from the northern companion all suggest that it is a star , of type mid - f or earlier .",
    "thus , the information on the qso from our data is that its host galaxy is marginally detected as light extending to the ne .",
    "its luminosity indicates m@xmath4 -23 or so ( with uncertainty of a magnitude ) .",
    "there is line emission from both [ o  iii ] and h@xmath0 .",
    "the [ o  iii ] may be extended along a ` jet ' whose direction is close to that of the reported radio jet , but much shorter .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission appears to be generally extended along the ne - sw directions , which suggests it is located throughout the host galaxy .",
    "all these results are close to the detection limit of our data , so need confirmation with much larger signal levels , and high spatial resolution .",
    "this qso is a compact radio source , and is the lowest redshift object in this sample at z = 0.85 . in paper 1",
    "we noted a knot 1.4 `` to the nw and a faint wisp of luminosity extending beyond , particularly in k band , in the direction of an object ( considered to be a star , 6 '' from the qso ) .",
    "we note that the published visible magnitude for the qso of 17.5 in hewitt and burbidge ( 1993 ) appears to be discrepant , as their references give 18.5 .",
    "our new data are in j band , in which our narrow - band filter isolates redshifted h@xmath0 .",
    "the images had the lowest fwhm of any we obtained , close to 0.11 `` , in both narrow and broad band filters .",
    "the ratio of narrow to broad band filter signal is 0.081 for the 3 brightest objects in the field , and 0.23 for the qso . with 0.08 scaling ,",
    "the continuum subtracted images removed the nearby star completely but left a considerable signal at the qso . however , the continuum - subtracted qso image also has fwhm 0.11 '' , so the h@xmath0 emission is also close to unresolved , and must arise overwhelmingly in or very near the nucleus .",
    "the subtracted image is elongated slightly ne - sw ( see figure 1 ) , so there may be some marginally extended line emission .",
    "the equivalent width of the h@xmath0 ( plus [ n ii ] ) implied is 290a .",
    "this yields a continuum j magnitude of 17.3 ( 17.1 without the h@xmath0 correction ) .",
    "the knot 1.3 \" to the nw , which is clearly seen in the h and k band images , is much fainter in j band , but present .",
    "its j magnitude is poorly determined at about 22 .",
    "the dither pattern used in the observation and the position of the guide star in this field resulted in some unevenness in the sky images in the region between the qso and the nearby star .",
    "it was not possible to detect the extended flux seen in the h and k bands from paper 1 ( taken with different dither pattern ) , and its j - band flux would be very low if it is as red as the knot .",
    "there is no evidence for h@xmath0 emission from this region in our data .",
    "accurate psf - subtraction from the j band image requires detailed modelling not possible with the data from this run .",
    "an approximate subtraction was done of a bright star closer to the guide star ( profiles shown in figure 3 ) .",
    "this results in an elongation ne - sw , similar to that of the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 image .",
    "while this is in the general direction of the guide star ( the direction the system might produce distortions ) , it is different by some 30@xmath3 . the flux after psf - subtraction corresponds to j magnitude 20.2 for the host galaxy , which is similar to the values found in h and k in our earlier paper , although less accurate with estimated error at 0.3 mag .",
    "overall , the new evidence on this object is that the host galaxy is blue ( nir colour indices close to zero ) and some times fainter than the nucleus , which corresponds to an absolute magnitude close to -22 in j , h , and k with no k - correction .",
    "it is possibly extended ne - sw in both continuum and h@xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath0 is predominantly unresolved , and there is no extended line emission associated with the wisp seen in h and k bands , to the nw .",
    "the nearby companion or knot is redder but detected in j band , and not in h@xmath0 .",
    "this is a qso from the hamburg quasar survey .",
    "only its redshift ( 2.154 ) and visible magnitude ( 18.4 ) are published ( engels et al 1998 ) , and it is not a known radio source .",
    "its redshifted [ o  iii ] is in our narrow - band filter .",
    "we find no source in the first radio survey at this position , to a flux density of @xmath11 mjy .",
    "the h band magnitude of the qso is 15.8 .",
    "the 2.6 mag difference to v = 18.4 corresponds to rest wavelengths of 1700 to 5000 .",
    "this suggests that the qso has uv extinction , contains a significant red component , or has varied .",
    "the guide star provides a rough check on the continuum subtraction scale factor at about 0.066 , while the filter bandpass data suggest a value of 0.071 . the observed ratio of 0.133 for the qso corresponds to an [ o  iii ] equivalent width of about 150a .",
    "the redshifted c iv 1550a ew indicated by the published spectrum of engels et al ( 1998 ) is about 100 , and the flux out to observed 6500a is declining with increasing wavelength .",
    "the continuum - subtracted [ o  iii ] image shows a broad asymmetry of emission to the sw ( see figures 1 and 6 ) , with a central jet - like feature that curves to the s from the nucleus , some 0.3 \" long .",
    "such structures are generally associated with radio jet activity from the nucleus . however , because of the very small scale and spatial resolution limits , it is possible that the structure arises from the merging or superposition of two bright emission line regions .",
    "the continuum image has a small inner bright extension from the nucleus in the same direction , but no signature of galaxy interaction .",
    "the removal of the broad - band psf is not straightforward .",
    "there is a companion star to the guide star that serves well as psf , and it has considerably sharper profile . the qso image is extended along the line to the guide star , and so needs modelling .",
    "if the psf image is elongated so as to match the qso radial profile , it loses the diffraction rings , which can be seen in the qso image .",
    "figures 3 and 6 illustrate this object . in any subtraction",
    ", there is significant residual light for any operation that leaves a light maximum at the qso nuclear position ( i.e. is not oversubtracted ) .",
    "there is no definite or persistent structure for the psf - removed image , and the signal level that remains indicates nuclear to host galaxy flux ratio in the range 2.5 to close to 1.0 .",
    "this is consistent with the well - resolved [ o  iii ] flux , and indicates a host galaxy of m@xmath4 - 28.4 , which is very luminous , even with the large uncertainty of 0.5 magnitudes in this value .",
    "the h - band image shows little in the field other than the qso .",
    "the position of the guide star just outside the field of view , leads to several diffuse reflections near the qso , which are easily recognized by their round flat - topped profiles .",
    "in addition , a bright diffraction spike for the guide star runs through the qso image . it is unlikely that these spurious features hide any real objects , and we detect only one compact galaxy , close to the guide star .",
    "overall , we find evidence for a luminous host galaxy , with asymmetrical line emission . the object should be re - observed with different camera orientation and in different filters , to learn more about it , and to confirm the results .",
    "this qso was observed only in h band , on both nights , as its redshift does not place an emission line in a nb filter bandpass .",
    "the image quality was comparable and the data were combined .",
    "there is no source at the qso position in the first radio survey , to a limit of about 2mjy .",
    "the qso was identified from the einstein emss x - ray survey as a 19th magnitude qso at redshift 1.843 .",
    "our broad - band data show the qso to have h magnitude 19.0 , which suggests it may be very blue , if it has not varied .",
    "the field is empty except for one faint galaxy some 17 `` to the south , and a large foreground spiral galaxy 12 '' to the north .",
    "the qso appears resolved in good seeing ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the image shows the elongation along the line to the guide star , as also seen in by 1227 + 4641 .",
    "the host galaxy flux for our best subtraction of profile and image ( i.e. not oversubtracted in the inner regions ) is 1.8 mag fainter than the qso , which corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -23.9 .",
    "the elongation towards the guide star is asymmetrical and thus may be partly instrinsic to the qso host galaxy , but there is no definite structure in the raw or psf - subtracted image .",
    "the uncertainty is about 0.5 magnitudes for the host galaxy magnitude , but in any case it is less luminous than the others in this program .",
    "this appears to be a radio - quiet qso in a poor environment .",
    "this investigation has detected extended line emission in all of the five qsos observed , and the results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the line emission is very compact and requires @xmath10.1 \" resolution to be seen .",
    "three of the qsos have redshifts close to 2.3 , and the others are lower , at 0.9 and 1.5 .",
    "all but one of the qsos are ( very compact ) radio sources , and in the two radio sources that are resolved , the line emission is aligned with it .",
    "we do not detect line emission from outside the qso host galaxy , such as found by stockton and mackenty ( 1987 ) in a low redshift sample , which include similar emission line fluxes .",
    "however , they note , along with boroson , persson , and oke ( 1985 ) that strong extended [ o  iii ] emission is generally found in qsos with extended steep - spectrum radio emission , and our sample are all compact radio sources or radio quiet",
    ". as well as being at high redshift , the qsos in this program are generally of higher luminosity .",
    "we have not attempted to compare the emission line region sizes and fluxes in table 2 , because of the effects of redshift and varying image quality and signal level , as well as small sample size .",
    "the h@xmath0 equivalent width is similar for the 3 objects where it is detected , and arises in all cases in extended regions that probably indicate young stars , and certainly arises within the confines of a normal - sized host galaxy .",
    "h@xmath0 also appears as a jet - like nuclear feature in 0348 - 120 , that may also indicate nuclear beaming .",
    "the [ o iii ] emission in all three detected cases forms a radial linear feature from the nucleus that suggests beamed nuclear activity , particularly as it aligns with the radio structure in the two resolved radio sources .",
    "the [ o iii ] equivalent width has a wider range than h@xmath0 , and we have already speculated that the cause of the one low value ( 0552 + 398 ) may be dust .",
    "the apparent sizes of the emission line regions ( see figure 1 ) are quite similar , with an inverse correlation with redshift at the half - power level ( hence similar in actual size ) .",
    "all these quantites need to be investigated in a larger sample before we can expect significant correlations .",
    "the success of this program indicates that it is possible to study the evolution of emission line gas in qso host galaxies , as well as their stellar populations and morphology .",
    "the linear nature of the emission line regions , and the association with known radio structure , strongly suggest that line emission is excited by nuclear radiation , which is beamed .",
    "the sizes of the regions we have observed lie between the nelr structure seen in low redshift seyferts and in low redshift qsos , but we have not sampled the full range of radio structures , which are strongly correlated with elr at low redshifts . since the high redshift qsos are in host galaxies at early stages of their formation and evolution , these observations will provide a measure of the beaming , gas density , and effects of merging within the host galaxies at different cosmic times .",
    "thus , extending the redshift range , and inclusion in the sample of large radio source qsos are highly desirable in order to map the evolution of the elr of qsos .",
    "two of our objects are very bright in h and ( hence ) very red : 0552 + 398 and 1227 + 4641 . both appear to have considerable resolved h - band flux , which needs more careful psf modelling , since the implied luminosities are very high .",
    "it is possible that these are young and dusty objects in which we speculate that much of the nuclear flux may be scattered into the nir .",
    "table 2 includes counts of other objects in the field : these are not sensitive to the range of exposure times or image quality in the sample , as they can all be seen within the range of image quality in the data , and in exposure subsets as short as our shortest observations .",
    "the numbers given exclude the guide star and other clearly identified stars , and large foreground galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "faint objects can be lost near to the guide star , and it is not always easy to distinguish faint stars from compact galaxies .",
    "the fields for the two objects also in paper 1 are not placed exactly as before , so there are small differences in galaxy counts for that reason too .",
    "we have already discussed this in the overlapping sample in paper 1 , in some more detail , but the numbers are consistent and the range of richness of possible companions in the field is large enough to be worthy of comment .",
    "the qso 0552 + 398 still stands out as having an unusually rich environment , and the two radio - quiet qsos have poor environments ( but so does one radio - loud one : 0828 + 2919 ) .",
    "there are suggestions that 3 of the qsos have visible signs of galaxy merging : 0348 - 120 , 0915 - 213 , and 1227 + 4641 , but deeper broad - band imaging is required .",
    "the broad - band exposures in this program were designed principally to enable continuum - subtraction from the narrow - band images .",
    "it is clear that a proper study of high redshift host galaxies and companions requires very deep exposures as well as high resolution .",
    "the narrow - band imaging results need to be extended to a sample of qsos of the type that have extended line emission at low redshift : steep spectrum extended radio sources , those with strong narrow emission lines , and weak fe ii emission .",
