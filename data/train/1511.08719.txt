    "control of quantum states by ac electric fields has attracted considerable attention in condensed matter physics  @xcite . in particular , coherent control of single - electron states in semiconductor superlattices ( sls )",
    "is a longstanding issue .",
    "it can be easily dealt with as a single - electron problem in a periodic potential driven by external fields , and has provided fascinating phenomena .",
    "a typical example of the related phenomena is the dynamical wannier - stark ladder ( dwsl ) in biased semiconductor sls driven by a terahertz cw laser@xcite .",
    "as is well known , when a static electric field @xmath6 is applied to semiconductor sls with a lattice constant @xmath7 , there appears discretized energy levels ( wannier - stark ladder , abbreviated as wsl ) with a constant energy interval of a bloch frequency @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the elementary charge of electron and planck s constant divided by @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "dwsl is the wsl driven by a cw laser with the frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the applied laser generally causes the photon - assisted tunneling ( pat ) between discrete wsl levels , leading to miniband formation accompanied by delocalized states of electron . on the contrary , at a certain strength of the laser intensity the formed miniband is collapsed , resulting in dynamic localization of electrons .",
    "thus , in dwsl , both of the localized and delocalized states are coherently controlled by altering a couple of laser parameters .",
    "as stated above , dwsl can be treated as a single - electron problem and has often been investigated by using a tight binding model . here",
    ", it should be noted that the tight binding model only takes account of a few lowest bound states in quantum wells .",
    "in fact , in a real situation , a strong laser field induces non - negligible couplings not only between these bound states but among all states including all bound states and continuum states .",
    "the effects caused by these couplings are termed as ac - zener tunneling ( ac - zt ) effects , and the tight binding model only partially incorporates the ac - zt effects  @xcite .",
    "some of the present authors and coworkers treat dwsl as a multichannel scattering problem incorporating all parts of the ac - zt effects  @xcite , and investigate the resonances structure of dwsl with integer numbers of a ratio @xmath12 by virtue of the numerical method based on the r - matrix floquet theory  @xcite ; @xmath1 is termed the matching ratio . here",
    "the term `` channel '' is associated with a photon - sideband state formed in dwsl .",
    "it is well - known that physical properties of dwsl are characterized by the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "dwsl with fractional @xmath13 is an objective of the present study , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are relatively prime numbers . herein , this is called dynamic fractional stark ladder ( dfsl )  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we focus on multi - channel resonance structure of dfsl caused by the ac - zt effect in a region of high laser - intensity . according to the preceding study  @xcite ,",
    "it is shown that a resonance peak of dfsl is shifted and broadened by the effect of the ac - zt and a fractal pattern characteristic of dfsl  @xcite does not necessarily hold . however , this study resorts just to a single - channel scattering problem without interchannel couplings ; this is considered correct just under the high - frequency approximation with @xmath16 .",
    "we examine the resonance structure of dfsl by resorting to a multichannel scattering problem including full effects of interchannel couplings . here , excess density of states ( dos )  @xcite , @xmath0 , is considered , which is closely related to the lifetime of the concerned floquet state with quasienergy @xmath17 .",
    "the obtained results are discussed with the idea that @xmath0 is analytically classified into a single - channel contribution @xmath18 , a multichannel non - resonance term @xmath19 , and a multichannel resonance term @xmath20  @xcite . for @xmath5",
    ", @xmath0 shows the appearance of a larger number of new peaks with increasing laser - intensity .",
    "in particular , we put a stress on that one of these grows into a new and discernibly intense peak in the vicinity of the second - lowest level of the wsl with anomalously long lifetime . as shown later , these phenomena are explained based on the mechanism of feshbach - like resonance  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework of our study is already described in the series of preceding papers  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we present its brief explanation for readers understanding .",

    "it is remarked that , in the asymptotic region of @xmath36 , @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] become the constant values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "in addition , @xmath62 should vanish in the region of @xmath73 .",

    "the shape of @xmath93 is more deformed and @xmath88 gradually increases  @xcite .",
    "however the peak structure of @xmath18 is still kept unaltered to some extent .    for larger @xmath34",
    ", @xmath88 further develops and accordingly , the contributions from the interchannel couplings , i.e. , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are expected to become dominant .",
    "particularly , @xmath0 is governed by @xmath20 for large @xmath88 , and it is shown that @xmath20 can be approximately expressed as @xmath94 with real values @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the notation of @xmath97 is introduced to represent a set of the indexes @xmath98 , where @xmath99 represents the quasienergy level associated with the @xmath100-th single channel equation  @xcite .",
    "as shown later in detail , according to eq .",
    "( [ rhores ] ) , in the region of large @xmath34 , there is a possibility that @xmath0 possesses novel spectral peaks which are not attributed to those of @xmath18 , where the peak is located at @xmath101 with the resonance width @xmath102 .",
    "it is seen that the sum of @xmath20 and @xmath19 is akin to the spectral function of the shore profile  @xcite with @xmath19 as a background ; this is an absorption lineshape of feshbach resonance  @xcite characteristic of a multichannel scattering problem . strictly speaking",
    ", the resonance mechanism described by @xmath103 and @xmath104 differs from the original feshbach resonance mechanism in that in the later , a pure discrete state decays into unstructured continuum states , whereas in the former , a shape - resonance state with relatively narrow width decays into that with structured continuum states with large width  @xcite .",
    "actually , even the lowest level in wsl is not completely bounded owing to a tilted potential .",
    "for this reason , the resonance governed by @xmath103 and @xmath104 is termed `` feshbach - like '' resonance in this study .",
    "finally , we give a comment on the periodicity of @xmath0 in dfsl for @xmath13 ; this quantity ensures the following periodicity relation in the brillouin zone with an interval @xmath3 as @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 as integers , where @xmath107 is termed as a split - subband index in this paper with @xmath108  @xcite .",

    "then , each potential of different channel also supports a photon - sideband at the same well , which results in the periodicity @xmath111 .",
    "in addition , it can be found that neighboring quantum wells also support the same lowest level , whose quasienergy levels shift by @xmath112 , causing the periodicity @xmath113 for @xmath5 . both of the periodicity are combined into the eq .",

    ".    it would be certain that the novel peaks `` a '' and `` b '' for @xmath153 are also due to the feshbach - like resonance mechanism . now , the origin of such new - peak appearance is brought to light based on the total green function projected onto a closed channel , denoted as @xmath154 ; this is associated with the denominator of the shore profile of eq.([rhores ] )  @xcite .",
    "the green function is formally expressed as @xmath155 , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 represent an unperturbed energy and a self - energy at quasienergy @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "it is noted that both energy and width of the feshbach - like resonance are determined by poles of @xmath154  @xcite in the lower - half complex @xmath17-plane .",
    "that is , the real part of a pole of @xmath154 gives the resonance energy and the imaginary part gives the resonance width . in the present system , @xmath157 includes the effect of the ponderomotive coupling @xmath88  @xcite in a non - perturbative manner .",
    "when @xmath88 is small , @xmath157 can be treated perturbatively , and thus @xmath154 has a single pole at @xmath158 .",
    "however , when @xmath88 is strong enough , a non - perturbative treatment is necessary , and it is required to solve the transcendental equation of @xmath159 to determine resonance poles ; the solutions generally correspond to multiple poles of @xmath154 .",
    "such a scenario suggests that a feshbach - like resonance peak originated from @xmath104 would split into a larger number of peaks with the increase in @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , the peak splitting of `` @xmath144 '' and `` a '' can be interpreted that a single pole of @xmath154 in the region of @xmath160 bifurcates in the region of @xmath161 .",
    "next , a stress is put on that the peak `` a '' at @xmath139 has extremely small @xmath162 .",
    "this seems to manifest itself under a particular condition that one of the two poles exists in the vicinity of a real axis in the lower - half complex @xmath17-plane . in general ,",
    "it is known that spectral peaks are more broaden as the strength of an applied laser increases because of a power - broadening mechanism due to a strong non - linear optical effect  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the irregularity observed here in spectral peak should be distinct from such a conventional understanding . according to our calculation ,",

    "it is found that resonance peaks show just monotonic behavior in both energy - shift and width in contrast to those for @xmath5 ; this is consistent with results of dwsl with larger integers of @xmath171 .",
    "this is because the effect of @xmath88 becomes negligibly smaller as @xmath1 increases  @xcite , and thus the contribution from @xmath20 is less dominant .",

    "the underlying physics of this manifestation is discussed in the light of the feshbach - like resonance profile described by both @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and poles of the associated green function @xmath154 . in particular , the peak splitting of `` @xmath144 '' and `` a '' at @xmath139 seems to result from the bifurcation of pole of @xmath154 due to the non - perturbative effect of @xmath88 .",
    "further , the origin of the narrow width of the peak `` a '' at @xmath139 is also discussed in terms of @xmath154 . on the other hand , long - lived states are generally extremely rare in such a high laser - intensity region due to the effect of power - broadening .",
