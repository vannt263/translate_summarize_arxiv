    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) arises in a broad range of astrophysical problems , most importantly in accretion disks , where it is generally accepted to be the source of the turbulence needed for material to spiral inward and accrete onto the central object @xcite .",
    "because of this crucial role that it plays in astrophysics , there is considerable interest in trying to study the mri in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "one recent suggestion @xcite involves externally imposing combined axial and azimuthal magnetic fields , which yields a new type of traveling wave mri . in this letter we present experimental evidence of these traveling waves , in accordance with the theory .",
    "the mri is a mechanism whereby a differential rotation flow that satisfies the rayleigh criterion , and is therefore hydrodynamically stable , may nevertheless be magnetohydrodynamically unstable .",
    "the addition of a magnetic field allows angular momentum to be transferred outward by the magnetic tension in the field lines , thereby bypassing the rayleigh criterion , which relies on individual fluid parcels conserving their angular momentum .",
    "the mri is particularly relevant to keplerian flows such as those found in accretion disks , where @xmath0 , which would indeed be stable according to the rayleigh criterion .",
    "the simplest design for attempting to reproduce the mri in the lab is based on the familiar taylor - couette problem , consisting of the flow between differentially rotating cylinders . while one can not achieve precisely a keplerian flow profile in this problem , by appropriately choosing the rotation rates of the inner and outer cylinders one can easily achieve a rayleigh - stable profile , which is all that is really required . by suitably adjusting the strength of an externally imposed magnetic field one",
    "should then be able to destabilize the flow again , via the mri .",
    "unfortunately , the situation is not quite so simple after all .",
    "if the imposed field is purely axial @xcite , the relevant parameter for the onset of the mri turns out to be the magnetic reynolds number @xmath1 , which must exceed @xmath2 . the hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath3 then exceeds @xmath4 , due to the extremely small magnetic prandtl numbers @xmath5 of liquid metals",
    "( @xmath6 is the viscosity , @xmath7 the magnetic diffusivity ) .",
    "such large rotation rates can be achieved , but for increasingly large reynolds numbers end - effects become increasingly important , and at @xmath8 may well disrupt the experiment @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if a combined axial and azimuthal field is imposed @xcite , the relevant parameter turns out to be @xmath9 , which must only be as large as @xmath10 to obtain the mri .",
    "these end - effects are therefore less severe .",
    "the solutions in this case are also somewhat different from those for purely axial imposed fields ; one obtains much the same taylor vortices as before , but the whole pattern now drifts along the length of the cylinders @xcite .",
    "this unfortunately introduces significant end - effects of its own , familiar in other contexts , such as drifting dynamo waves @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that the experimental results in a bounded cylinder agree reasonably well with the theoretical results in an unbounded cylinder .",
    "the experimental apparatus consists of a cylindrical annulus made of copper , with @xmath11 cm , @xmath12 cm , and height 40 cm .",
    "the top endplate is made of plexiglass , and is stationary ; the bottom endplate is made of copper , and rotates with the outer cylinder .",
    "an axial magnetic field is imposed by running a current , up to 200 a , through a series of coils surrounding the entire apparatus ; an azimuthal magnetic field is imposed by running a current , up to 8000 a , through a rod along the central axis .",
    "field strengths of several hundred g can then be achieved , for both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the fluid contained within the vessel is a gainsn alloy , having density @xmath15 , viscosity @xmath16 and magnetic diffusivity @xmath17 , so @xmath18 .",
    "measurements were made by two ultrasonic transducers mounted on opposite sides of the top endplate , 1.5 cm from the outer wall .",
    "these provided measurements of @xmath19 at these particular locations , along the entire 40 cm depth of the container .",
    "see also @xcite for further details of the experimental setup .    for the results presented here ,",
    "the rotation rates of the inner and outer cylinders were fixed at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , so @xmath22 , within the rayleigh - stable regime @xmath23 .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath24 .",
    "the axial field @xmath13 was also fixed , at 77.2 g , corresponding to a hartmann number @xmath25 .",
    "the azimuthal field @xmath14 was then varied , between 0 and 350 g ( at @xmath26 ) , corresponding to electric currents up to 7000 a along the central rod .",
    "figure 1 shows the temporal variation of the axial velocity @xmath19 , as a function of @xmath27 along the container .",
    "the ( depth - dependent ) time - average has been subtracted , to remove the two ekman vortices induced by the endplates @xcite .",
    "as @xmath14 is increased , we see the gradual emergence of ever more coherent structures , drifting at speeds of 0.51 mm / s .",
    "focussing attention on @xmath27 between 10 and 20 cm , where the waves are most clearly defined , we obtain around 0.6 mm / s for 3 ka , and 0.8 mm / s for 5 and 7 ka .",
    "the corresponding wavelengths are 78 cm for 3 ka , and 5 - 6 cm for 5 and 7 ka .",
    "we claim that these structures are precisely the expected traveling wave mri .",
    "note though that end - effects do indeed play an important role in fig .  1 , for example at the upper boundary , where the waves die away some 510 cm from the end .",
    "another indication of the importance of end - effects , and in particular the asymmetry between the two ends , can be seen in the 0 a results : the asymmetry between top and bottom that is already visible even in this case must be caused entirely by the endplates , as a purely axial field does not distinguish between @xmath28 .",
    "figure 2 shows the critical reynolds number for the onset of this traveling wave mri in an unbounded cylinder , as a function of the externally imposed fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; these results were computed as in @xcite or @xcite , with conducting boundary conditions . provided @xmath29 g and @xmath30 g , reynolds numbers of @xmath10 are already sufficient",
    ". if @xmath14 is less than 150 g , @xmath31 gradually rises , until for @xmath32 we would have @xmath33 , the familiar result from the analysis of purely axial fields .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath13 is less than 30 g , the instability simply ceases to exist ; that is , @xmath31 has an essentially vertical asymptote at this boundary .",
    "the five asterisks in fig .  2 correspond to the five plots shown in fig .  1 , and",
    "the dotted contour line to the experimental value @xmath34 .",
    "we see therefore that the experimental runs with @xmath35 , 1 and 3 ka should be stable , whereas the ones with 5 and 7 ka should be unstable .",
    "this is broadly in agreement with fig .  1 ,",
    "although there even the supposedly stable runs already show hints of traveling wave disturbances , particularly at 3 ka .",
    "however , the waves are much more strongly developed for the 5 and 7 ka runs , as predicted by fig .",
    "2 .    fig .",
    "3 shows the wavelengths and speeds of the unstable solutions at @xmath36 .",
    "wavelengths are in the range 1020 cm , speeds around 1.1 mm / s ( for @xmath37 g ) .",
    "the speeds agree rather well with fig .  1 ;",
    "the experimental result that 5 and 7 ka yield virtually the same speed , 0.8 mm / s , also nicely matches the theoretical prediction that the speed should be almost independent of @xmath14 ( provided @xmath14 is large enough to be in the unstable regime at all ) .",
    "the wavelengths do not agree quite so well ; the values in fig .  1 are barely half those in fig .  3 .",
    "presumably this is again due to end - effects ; a 20 cm long wave certainly could not traverse a 40 cm long container without experiencing significant end - effects .",
    "in this letter we have presented experimental evidence for the existence of traveling wave disturbances in a liquid metal taylor - couette apparatus , and shown them to be in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions , particularly with regard to the wave speeds .",
    "future experimental work will more thoroughly map out the entire @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 parameter space , as well as explore the role that different axial boundary conditions , on both the flow @xcite and the field @xcite , might play . future numerical work will similarly consider the problem in bounded cylinders , with different boundary conditions on the endplates .",
    "only then will we fully understand what influence the endplates , and possible asymmetries between them , have on the mri .",
