    "the idea of deforming the oscillator algebra to obtain new solvable systems - in particular those connected to quantum optics @xcite - is a vivid example of an old precept : there are two classes of problems , given by the unsolved ones and the harmonic oscillator ; the idea is to move examples of the former class into the latter @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath1- and @xmath0- deformations of the heisenberg algebra @xcite have proved to be sufficiently rich , containing hamiltonians with both finite and infinite levels in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "moreover , the inherent nonlinearity of deformations suggests a strong relation to old , but relevant models of electrodynamics @xcite . in a different realm of physics , but following the same precept , a mapping of a dirac oscillator to a lattice has been reached by means of recursion relations @xcite .",
    "this indicates a direct connection between the number of quanta of an oscillator and the site number of a semi - infinite chain @xcite .    despite the vast literature related to this subject ,",
    "little has been said about the configuration space emanating from algebraic deformations . in this paper",
    "we show the existence of an @xmath0-deformed heisenberg algebra that turns the hamiltonian @xmath2 into an ergodic operator , while its position @xmath3 - equivalently @xmath4 - acquires a spectrum given by the cantor set .",
    "this surprising result makes manifest the non - trivial topological properties of an algebraically modified space .",
    "for instance , the spectral measure of such a space vanishes , despite the uncountability of the eigenvalues associated to the deformed position operator .",
    "we thus have a _ purely singular  _ phase space , if we borrow the term from spectral theory @xcite .",
    "we proceed in two steps . in section [ one ]",
    "we show a direct relation between the position operator of a deformed heisenberg algebra and a deformed tight - binding chain without on - site potentials .",
    "then , in section [ two ] we map unitarily an off - diagonal operator representing @xmath3 to harper s model .",
    "the map contains as a special case a deformed semi - infinite tight - binding chain without potentials .",
    "the spectrum of the resulting system is found to be identical to hofstadter s butterfly @xcite when plotted as a function of an external parameter .",
    "a few remarks on finite size effects in numerical results are given .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the @xmath5deformations of heisenberg s algebra suggested by manko @xcite allow the introduction of a very general deformation function @xmath6 of the usual number operator @xmath7 . in natural units ,",
    "we have the well - known relations    = i , = 1 , af(n)=f(n+1)a . [ algebra ] a= ( x+ip ) , a^= ( x - ip ) . meanwhile , the deformed operators @xmath8 are established ) , which is slightly different from the standard notation .",
    "see the third relation in ( [ algebra ] ) .",

    "we have    h= ( p^2 + x^2 ) = ( aa^ + a^ a ) = , showing that the spectrum @xmath10 is not necessarily equispaced .",
    "since the last relation expresses @xmath11 as a function of @xmath12 , @xmath10 can be obtained by acting directly on the usual harmonic oscillator basis @xmath13 , resulting in the following expression    e_n = , n=0,1,2,3 , ... on the other hand , the spectrum of the position operator @xmath3 can be found by diagonalizing the matrix representation @xmath14 between harmonic oscillator states :    n | x | m = . incidentally , since phase space operators are unitarily related by    p = ( i ) x ( - i ) = i^n x i^-n , then @xmath4 and @xmath3 are isospectral .",
    "now , if the eigenstates @xmath15 of @xmath3 are expanded in the usual oscillator basis @xmath16 , we are led to a recurrence relation for @xmath17 after substituting in @xmath18 , i.e.    _ n+1 + _ n-1",
    "= _ n with the boundary condition @xmath19 .",
    "this can indeed be interpreted in terms of a nearest - neighbour tight - binding model : if we identify @xmath20 with hopping amplitudes @xmath21 ( also known as couplings ) and @xmath22 with the @xmath23-th energy of a hopping particle in a chain , we have the equivalent relation    _",
    "n+1 ^k_n+1 + _",
    "n ^k_n-1 = _ k ^k_n and the boundary condition can be fictitiously imposed by setting @xmath24 ; this completes the analogy with a semi - infinite chain .",
    "we may employ translation operators @xmath25 and a site - number operator @xmath12 to express the tight - binding equation in hamiltonian form ,    h_t.b.| ^k =| ^k = ^k | ^k , |^k = _ n=0^ _ n^k | n , with the properties t |n = | n+1 ,",
    "t^|n= | n-1 , t^ | 0 = 0 , n |n = n | n . the atomic states @xmath26 must now be interpreted as vectors whose space representations @xmath27 are functions of a real position variable @xmath28 ; such functions are localized around site @xmath29 .",
    "it is convenient to mention here that in certain applications of tight - binding models , such as photonic crystals @xcite or optical lattices @xcite , the coupling constants @xmath30 can be engineered by means of evanescent waves coming out of a potential well or a resonating cavity located at a lattice site .",
    "ergodic hamiltonians @xcite are a key ingredient of fractal spectra , in particular for the ` almost ' mathieu operator @xcite . in a more general fashion , an ergodic hamiltonian may contain operators whose spectrum is dense and uncountable in a subset of @xmath31 . here",
    "we must specify our deformation function such that @xmath32 is ergodic .",
    "an operator @xmath33 with such a property can be obtained by means of a quasiperiodic function of @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath33 be periodic of period @xmath34 :    o(n+ ) = o(n ) but now , if @xmath35 and @xmath34 are non - commensurate , the operator @xmath36 does not have period @xmath34 in the variable @xmath12 :    o((n+ ) ) = o(n + ) o(n ) .",
    "moreover , there is no translation of oscillator quanta that leads to invariance , i.e. for any @xmath37    o((n+k ) ) = o(n + k ) o(n + q ) = o(n ) .",
    "in addition , if @xmath33 is a hermitian bounded operator its spectrum must be dense , for acting on @xmath38 yields a set equivalent to the irrational numbers within @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "a more specific example can be given in terms of trigonometric functions : if our deformation function @xmath40 is set as    f(n ) = [ f ] then the hamiltonian @xmath41 will become    h = ( ^2 + ^2 ) .",
    "now we take @xmath35 to be non commensurate with @xmath42 , such that @xmath43 generates a dense set contained in an interval .",
    "one can verify that the limits of the interval depend on @xmath35 .",
    "the position operator @xmath3 now has the form of an ergodic operator , since it contains ( [ f ] ) in its definition , and when @xmath35 is non commensurate with @xmath42 , the spectrum of @xmath44 is dense in the interval @xmath45 $ ] . here",
    "we claim and prove that in fact @xmath3 is isospectral to a tight - binding hamiltonian that produces harper s equation , namely    h _",
    "= t + t^ + 2 ( n - ) .",
    "[ harper ] this is in principle unusual , since @xmath46 contains no lattice deformations ( constant couplings ) and the effect of fractality in its spectrum is due solely to the external field . on the other hand , @xmath3 is a pure deformation , without diagonal terms .",
    "we shall see that there exists a unitary @xmath47 such that @xmath48 with @xmath49 an overall scaling factor .",
    "let us start with    x & = & a + a^ + & = & a + a^ + & = & a + a^. from here , we see that we may work with more generality using the following rescaled operator and the introduction of an extra parameter @xmath50    x _ = a + a^ + = a + a^ + a + a^ + h_0 + v , [ x ] where h_0= a + a^ + v = a + a^. in what follows we show that @xmath51 corresponds to the addition of two translation operators and @xmath52 to a local potential of a transformed variable , using the appropriate basis .",
    "in order to transform @xmath53 unitarily , we work now at the level of states using the definition     appropriate normalization constant .",
    "it is a matter of simple algebra to verify the following equations :    \\ { a^ } | k ) = | k+1 ) , \\ { a } | k ) = |",
    "k-1 ) [ trans0 ] \\{a + a^ } |k ) = 2 | k ) .",
    "[ trans ] here one may proceed by direct substitution of ( [ expansion ] ) in the second relation of ( [ trans0 ] ) , while the first relation follows by recognizing that     & = & \\ { a^ } | k ) .",
    "in fact , the expansion coefficients in ( [ expansion ] ) can be derived by solving the set of recurrences emerging from ( [ trans0 ] , [ trans ] ) as requirements .",
    "now that we have established these properties , the following identifications are in order    h_0 = t_k + t^_k , v = 2 i.e. @xmath54 are translation operators in @xmath23 and @xmath52 is a function of the number operator @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",
    "we also write @xmath57 , @xmath58 to simplify the notation .",
    "harper s equation now emerges transparently when @xmath53 is applied to its eigenvector @xmath59 written as a linear superposition @xmath60 ; the recurrence is    _",
    "k+1 + _ k-1 + 2 ( k - ) _ k = _",
    "k. moreover , since @xmath61 , this equation corresponds to an infinite chain .",
    "it is left to verify that the transformation @xmath62 is unitary .",
    "this is most easily done by applying the transpose conjugate of ( [ expansion ] ) to @xmath63 as follows :    _",

    "k=-^ \\{-i } + _ m=0^ \\{i } |m + = _ m=0^ \\ { i } \\{_k=-^ e^2 ik ( n - m)}| m + = |n where in the last line we recognize that the summation in braces is a properly normalized delta , so @xmath64 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the map described above does not work when ( [ harper ] ) contains the more general potential @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "this seems to be connected with the known result @xcite that only @xmath67 produces a purely singular spectrum . for general @xmath68 ,",
    "the deformation function becomes complex    f(n ) & = & + & = & and its spectrum is modified .",
    "when @xmath69 or @xmath70 , the trigonometric part becomes a mere perturbation .",
    "as pointed out in very early works @xcite on this subject , the spectrum of this system is equivalent to cantor s set when @xmath35 is non commensurate with @xmath42 , i.e. it is purely singular .",
    "this is independent of the value of @xmath50 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath35 and @xmath42 are commensurate we have @xmath71 , and the system becomes periodic .",
    "the period is @xmath1 if @xmath72 are relatively primes ; this implies that a structure of @xmath1 bands should emerge .",
    "as @xmath73 approaches irrationality , the number of such bands increases as a power of a given initial number ( say , two bands for a precursor of cantor s set ) and their length decreases in a similar amount .",
    "this analysis is also valid for our off - diagonal @xmath53 as expressed in ( [ x ] ) , since it only requires the ergodic behavior of @xmath74 .",
    "usually , the spectrum is depicted by showing a sequence of shrinking intervals as a function of @xmath35 , giving rise to the famous butterfly . in our problem",
    ", we may diagonalize directly the operator @xmath53 by a suitable numerical routine and plot the spectrum",
    ". since the matrix representations that we use are of a finite size , an additional artefact appears in the pattern : the gaps between bands for rational @xmath35 contain eigenvalues due to edge states .",
    "such bands proliferate in a self - similar pattern and it is to be expected that edge states appear in various regions of the spectral span . to verify that indeed such states are due to finite size effects , we proceed to diagonalize @xmath53 for increasing sizes @xmath75 and we vary @xmath76 for each size .",
    "we show the results in fig . [",
    "fig : i.0 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : i.1 ] we repeat the calculation , but with periodic boundary conditions ; the results reveal a significant displacement of border levels towards the allowed bands",

    "a fractal position spectrum has been found .",
    "the example that we have studied has been shown to be equivalent to the reduced problem of an electron in a square lattice under the influence of a magnetic field .",
    "we also computed the spectrum numerically to verify the property of isospectrality , recognizing that very small discrepancies arise due to finite size .",
    "undoubtedly , experiments can be carried out in the context of artificial solids , such as those produced by optical lattices , photonic crystals or microwave resonators . in particular",
    ", a nearest - neighbour tight - binding chain of identical sites and adjustable distances has been used succesfully to produce other models , and this choice is likely to give immediate results in the present case .",
    "it is also important to note that a realization of ergodic hamiltonians using a fixed photon mode in a cavity is not a complete diversion from quantum optical applications : it is a non - linear example of oscillation that can be studied and perhaps partially tested . due to the extreme dependence of its effective frequency @xmath79",
