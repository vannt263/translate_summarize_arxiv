    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) has proven to be an excellent technology for quantum communication , with spdc photons functioning as `` flying qubits . ''",
    "the discovery by knill _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that linear optics and single photon detectors are sufficient for scalable quantum computation has opened the possibility that spdc may also be useful for quantum computation .",
    "as the proposals for quantum information processing with spdc become more sophisticated , the technical demands placed on spdc sources become more stringent . for example , a quantum key distribution experiment based on polarization entanglement requires that two two - photon amplitudes ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for example ) be made indistinguishable .",
    "the spectral properties of the two photons are only important if they are correlated to the polarization degree of freedom . a more stringent form of indistinguishability is typically required for quantum computation with linear optics : it must be impossible to determine which source produced a certain photon after that photon emerges from a beamsplitter .",
    "this in turn requires that all of the photons properties be controlled such that it is impossible to learn any information about the identity of a given photon s source .",
    "photon pairs produced by spdc are often correlated in one or more of their properties ( frequency , direction , etc . ) .",
    "these correlations can destroy the requisite indistinguishability by enabling one to learn about one photon by performing measurements on its twin  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe an spdc source that produces photon pairs that have arbitrary correlation in frequency .",
    "the source we propose enables an unusual flexibility in the control of the marginal spectra of the spdc photons .",
    "specifically , our source can produce frequency - uncorrelated photon pair in which the center frequency and the bandwidth of each photon is controlled independently , regardless of the nonlinear material s dispersion curves .",
    "this makes the source well - suited for applications that span quantum communication and computation , such as teleportation  @xcite and entanglement swapping  @xcite . in these applications ,",
    "one photon of a pair ( the `` communication '' photon ) is often sent to another party through a long span of optical fiber , while the other photon ( the `` computation '' photon ) is analyzed and detected in a localized interferometer .",
    "it is desirable that the communication photon be narrow - band ( such that effects like polarization mode dispersion are mitigated ) and have a wavelength in the infrared ( where optical fiber is least lossy ) .",
    "contrariwise , the computation photon should be broad - band ( such that it can be used in interferometers with small path - length differences ) and have a wavelength suited for high - efficiency single - photon counters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ gapmspdc ]",
    ", we introduce the new technique and demonstrate that it permits the generation of photon pairs with arbitrary joint spectrum . in section  [ example ] , we show how this spectral control can be combined with polarization entanglement by considering a specific example involving a bbo waveguide . in section  [ int ]",
    ", we discuss the possibility of using this source as part of a distributed quantum information processor based on integrated optics .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "our source is a generalization of the design we previously introduced under the name _ auto - phase - matched _",
    "spdc  @xcite ; thus , we name the new scheme _ generalized _ auto - phase - matched spdc . like the original scheme , the new scheme features counter - propagating spdc created in a single - mode nonlinear waveguide by a transverse pump pulse . in the original scheme ( fig .",
    "[ setup]a ) , the pump pulse is cross - spectrally pure ( _ i.e. _ the complex envelope factors into separate functions of space and time ) , and impinges on the waveguide at normal incidence . in the new scheme ( fig .  [ setup]b ) , the pump pulse may have cross - spectral correlations , and may approach the waveguide at non - normal incidence . with these constraints on the pump pulse",
    "relaxed , the center frequency and bandwidth of each spdc photon may be controlled independently .    in typical spdc experiments ,",
    "a monochromatic pump beam is used . in this situation ,",
    "the sum of the frequencies of the signal and idler photons is fixed , thus the photons frequencies are anticorrelated .",
    "spdc with generalized joint spectral properties ( _ i.e. _ correlated , uncorrelated , anticorrelated ) was studied theoretically by campos _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we review the experimental proposals for generating frequency - uncorrelated spdc .",
    "a number of techniques have been proposed for creating frequency - uncorrelated spdc ; however , they all impose certain constraints on the center frequencies and/or bandwidths of the spdc photons .",
    "proposed a method for creating frequency - uncorrelated spdc based on a group - velocity matching condition introduced by keller and rubin  @xcite .",
    "their method can be used to create degenerate , frequency - uncorrelated photons ; however , the center frequency of down - conversion is fixed by the nonlinear material , and the bandwidth of two spdc photons must be equal .",
    "they also demonstrate that degenerate , frequency - uncorrelated photons with different bandwidths may be generated ; however , in this case the bandwidths are fixed and can not be independently controlled .",
    "proposed extending the approach of grice _ el al .",
    "_ by using a periodically poled nonlinear crystal  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to to satisfy the zeroth - order term in the phase - matching relation at an arbitrary pump wavelength , making the group - velocity matching relation easier to satisfy .",
    "even with such an enhancement , this approach does not have sufficient flexibility to allow independent control of the marginal spectra .",
    "a distinct approach for creating frequency - uncorrelated spdc was independently discovered by uren _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and our group  @xcite . instead of relying on the satisfaction of a group - velocity matching condition , these approaches rely on the geometrical symmetry of degenerate , non - collinear type - i spdc ( the previously mentioned techniques only worked with type - ii spdc ) .",
    "the essential difference between the two proposals is that for uren _ et al .",
    "_ , the phase - matching relation in the pump propagation direction is a constraint that must be satisfied , while for our auto - phase - matched technique , the single - mode waveguide ensures that this relation is satisfied , regardless of the system parameters .",
    "the relative lack of constraints for these techniques makes them attractive , since it suggests that they remain viable options even if the center frequency of spdc is constrained by some other factor ( optical fiber loss , detector efficiency , etc . ) .",
    "nonetheless , both techniques suffer a lack of flexibility that is reminiscent of the previously mentioned schemes .",
    "the spdc photons must be degenerate , and the bandwidths of the two photons must be equal . in the next section ,",
    "we show that by generalizing our auto - phase - matched technique , we can obtain independent spectral control of the spdc photons .",
    "to begin , we review the relationship between the pump pulse and the spdc in the geometry of fig .",
    "[ setup ] . following the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite , a classical pump pulse described on the free - space side of the waveguide - air interface by @xmath2 stimulates the creation of a pair of photons described by the two - photon wavefunction @xmath3 where @xmath4\\ ] ] @xmath5 is the refractive index for the pump polarization . here , and for the rest of the paper , we use the variable @xmath6 to refer to the component of the pump wavevector along the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the ket @xmath8 represents a signal photon in the frequency mode @xmath9 and an idler photon in the frequency mode @xmath10 with corresponding propagation constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . equation  ( [ wavefunction ] ) conveys the main result of this paper : assuming the dispersion properties of the medium are known , it is possible to generate a down - converted photon pair with arbitrary joint spectrum by appropriately engineering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the pump pulse .    in fig .",
    "[ setup]a , the pump pulse is parameterized by three numbers : the center frequency , the temporal coherence length @xmath13 , and the spatial coherence length @xmath14 .",
    "these parameters may be chosen to produce degenerate spdc with controllable entanglement , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , in order to obtain independent control of the center frequency and bandwidth of each spdc photon , one must relax the constraints on the pump pulse , as in fig .",
    "[ setup]b . using eqs .",
    "( [ pump ] ) and ( [ wavefunction ] ) , it is straightforward to show that a pump pulse described by    @xmath15\\ ] ]    will yield the following frequency - uncorrelated two - photon state @xmath16\\,|\\omega_s\\rangle_s\\,|\\omega_i\\rangle_i,\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the center frequencies of the signal and idler beams , respectively , and we have used the following definitions and approximations : @xmath19 these approximations are valid in typical situations ; however , if required , more terms may be used at the expense of a more complicated expression for the pump pulse .",
    "equations  ( [ genpump ] ) and ( [ genwavefunction ] ) summarize the central result of this work . taken together , these relations can be thought of as an algorithm for producing frequency - uncorrelated spdc with arbitrary marginal spectra .",
    "the wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ genwavefunction ] ) describes a frequency - uncorrelated two - photon state in which the signal photon is centered on @xmath17 with a bandwidth @xmath20 , and the idler photon is centered on @xmath18 with a bandwidth @xmath21 .",
    "note that these two photons are not themselves indistinguishable ( unless @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , the indistinguishability arises in a multi - photon experiment when one photon of the pair enters an interferometer with one or more photons that have identical spectra . in this case",
    ", the lack of frequency correlations between the signal and idler prevents a loss of interferometric visibility by ensuring that spectral measurements on one photon of the pair wo nt reveal any spectral information about the other .",
    "equations  ( [ genpump]-[end ] ) demonstrate that the four numbers @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , along with the dispersion properties of the waveguide , are sufficient to determine the form of the pump pulse required to generate the desired wavefunction .",
    "we can simplify the description of the pump pulse by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ genpump ] ) as @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 the algorithm for creating the appropriate pump pulse to produce the state in eq .",
    "( [ genwavefunction ] ) is as follows .",
    "a pulse is created with center frequency @xmath26 , spectral bandwidth @xmath27 and spatial bandwidth @xmath28 .",
    "next , a dispersive element such as a wedge of quartz or a diffraction grating is used to correlate @xmath6 and @xmath29 by effecting the substitution @xmath30 finally , the pulse it directed towards the nonlinear waveguide at incidence angle @xmath31 where @xmath32 is measured outside the waveguide ( see fig .  [ setup]b ) , and @xmath33 is the speed of light in vacuum .        in fig .",
    "[ jointspectrum ] , we present a graphical depiction of the relationship between the pump pulse and the resulting two - photon state , for both auto - phase - matched spdc ( fig .",
    "[ jointspectrum]a ) and generalized auto - phase - matched spdc ( fig .",
    "[ jointspectrum]b ) . in both cases ,",
    "a plot of @xmath34 is superposed over the joint spectrum of the signal and idler photons . by plotting @xmath34 at the correct location and on the correct inner axes",
    ", one can immediately infer the joint spectrum of the down - converted photons , simply by interpreting the plot using the outer axes . in fig .",
    "[ jointspectrum]a , the non - zero portion of @xmath34 is centered on the @xmath35 axis , and one of the inner axes is scaled by the factor @xmath36 , which is the first derivative of @xmath37 evaluated at @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ jointspectrum]b , the non - zero portion of @xmath34 is located at a general position , and the inner axes are no longer orthogonal ( unless @xmath39 ) . using this figure ,",
    "the two desirable features of the two - photon joint spectrum ( non - degeneracy and independently controlled bandwidths ) are easily interpreted in terms of the pump pulse .",
    "that is , the non - degeneracy of the photon pair derives from the condition @xmath40 , which in turn derives from the non - normal incidence of the pump pulse .",
    "similarly , the independent control of the two photons respective bandwidths derives from the cross - spectral correlation in the pump pulse ( @xmath34 does not factor into a function of @xmath6 times a function of @xmath29 ) .",

    "the pump pulse is comprised of coherently superposed , independently controlled pulses @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the two polarization modes @xmath7 and @xmath47 , respectively .",

    "[ gapmspdc ] .",
    "the negative values of @xmath32 indicate that the projection of the pump wavevector along the waveguide is oriented in the negative @xmath7 direction ( see fig .",
    "[ setup]b ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the generalized auto - phase - matched technique , one can obtain polarization entanglement by adjusting the polarization state of the pump pulse , without sacrificing the spectral control described above . to illustrate this feature , we present an example involving non - degenerate",
    ", polarization - entangled spdc produced in a single - mode bbo waveguide .",
    "the general idea is to use two of the nonlinear medium s @xmath49 tensor elements at the same time , by preparing a coherent superposition of two polarization modes of the pump pulse . when producing polarization - entangled photon pairs , it is typically desirable that a given photon have the same spectral properties for both two - photon polarization amplitudes",
    ". therefore , in creating the pump pulse , we use the same four numbers @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 in calculating the desired pulse shape for both pump polarization modes .",
    "however , since the two two - photon amplitudes relate to spdc processes taking place in distinct polarization modes , the dispersion properties of the waveguide will in general be different .",

    "these values for center wavelength and coherence length were chosen in order to make the signal photon suitable for long - distance optical fiber transmission , and the idler photon suitable for local processing in an integrated optical circuit .",

    "generalized auto - phase - matched spdc is particularly well - suited for quantum information processing on an integrated optical circuit ( see fig .  [ integrated ] ) . among the advantages of replacing an array of discrete optical elements with an integrated optical circuit",
    "are the following : reduced size , reduced loss due to fewer connectors , and `` common mode '' noise processes because of the close proximity of optical elements .",
    "however , there are substantial experimental challenges associated with constructing an integrated optical quantum information processor .",
    "perhaps the most obvious challenge is finding a material that can perform as many of the required functions ( photon source , modulation , detection ) as possible . a significant advantage of generalized auto - phase - matched spdc in that the choice of material places essentially no limitation on the spectral and polarization properties of the photon pairs that will be produced .",
