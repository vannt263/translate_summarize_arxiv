    "in this paper we investigate a phenomenon of vast relevance in physics : returns .",
    "whenever a system evolves according to a deterministic , or even a probabilistic law , along the course of time it may pass close to points previously visited .",
    "we then speak of returns and of return times .",
    "of course , this concept can be made precise and rigorous : this has been done since the beginning of the theory of dynamical system , where poincar theorem  establishing that in measure preserving systems returns happen almost surely  is probably the first and certainly the most celebrated result . passing via kac theorem and coming to recent years",
    ", mathematical investigation has flourished and produced beautiful results relating the statistics of return times , _",
    "i.e. _ the collective counting of these values , to more conventional dynamical indicators , such as generalized dimensions of invariant measures , lyapunov exponents and the like",
    ". this paper continues in this ongoing investigation , with a special character : rather than presenting a single , thoroughly investigated result , we attempt to provide a heuristic , global picture of the dynamical phenomena that are at work . this picture will be confirmed by numerical experiments .",
    "rigor and detailed proofs will be the matter for successive publications .",
    "there exist many different alternatives when defining returns : in this paper , we make specific reference to what is called the first return of a ( measurable ) subset @xmath0 of a compact metric space , endowed with a measure @xmath1 defined on the borel sigma algebra @xmath2 .",
    "motion on @xmath3 is effected by the action of a transformation @xmath4 that preserves the measure @xmath1 .",
    "we thereby define the _ time of first return of @xmath0 _ into itself as @xmath5 as anticipated in the abstract , this is the time of the earliest return to @xmath0 of one of its points : @xmath6    two choices will be made for @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , @xmath0 will be a ball of radius @xmath7 , centered at a point @xmath8 : @xmath9 .",
    "secondly , @xmath0 will be a dynamically generated cylinder .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath10 is a finite partition of @xmath3 and take the n - join , @xmath11 .",
    "we call cylinder of length @xmath12 around @xmath13 , denoted with @xmath14 , the unique element of @xmath15 containing @xmath16",
    ". the statistics of return times are then defined by the collective counting , over different sets , of the values @xmath17 .",
    "the distribution of return times , @xmath18 is @xmath19 similarly , @xmath20 is defined replacing @xmath9 by @xmath14 .",
    "they measure the fraction of points in the space @xmath3 whose neighborhood ( whether a ball of radius @xmath21 , or a cylinder of length @xmath22 ) first returns to itself after @xmath23 iterations of the map .",
    "we shall also consider the cumulative distributions ( integrated statistics ) @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "our aim will be to study the behavior of these distributions in systems that are simple enough to permit both a theoretical analysis and a precise numerical simulation .",
    "the time of first return of sets ( [ deftc ] ) arises in several circumstances .",
    "since it controls the shortest return time of points in the set , it plays a crucial role to establish the asymptotic ( exponential ) distribution of the return times of all points to the set @xmath0 , when the measure of the set @xmath0 goes to zero , a different and much investigated topic @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been used to define the recurrence dimension , being used as the gauge set function to construct a suitable carathodory measure @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been related to the algorithmic information content @xcite .",
    "returns of sets is also relevant in applications , like those of biological interest .",
    "in fact , when the space @xmath3 consists of sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet ( think _ e.g. _ of dna sequencing ) particular _ words _ , or _",
    "motifs _ have been found to be related to biological mechanisms like transcription sites or protein interaction ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is then important to quantify the statistical properties of these words within the genome .",
    "in particular , a typical word of length @xmath22 ( that is , a finite sequence of @xmath22 letters ) will recur within a time of the order @xmath27 , for large @xmath22 , where @xmath28 is the metric entropy of the system , as predicted by the ornstein - weiss theorem @xcite . yet",
    ", if we look at the delay of the first recurrence of the same word , when observed in the whole ( possibly infinite ) sequence , this scales as @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this time of first return is precisely the quantity studied in this paper .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in the next section we review a few results that are useful for the understanding of the paper .",
    "for this reason we neither need nor claim completeness . in sect .",
    "[ seccyl ] we consider the case of return times in cylinders for bernoulli systems .",
    "quite evidently , this is the simplest setting where to study return times of sets .",
    "we first present a heuristic explanation of the results rigorously proven in @xcite and @xcite that permit to compute , via return times , the rnyi entropies .",
    "then , we refine this analysis to obtain new results on the type of convergence of the conventional quantities and we introduce a new one , for which convergence is much faster .",
    "moreover , our theory allows us to obtain a description of the different asymptotics of @xmath20 in the @xmath29 plane . in sect .",
    "[ secexpa ] we leave the symbolic description to enter a geometric setting by considering expanding maps of the interval .",
    "we show how results proven in the symbolic setting can be adapted to describe the distribution function @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , we obtain a formula for the asymptotic behavior of this function when @xmath23 and @xmath31 grow while keeping a constant ratio , that involves the lyapunov exponent and the rnyi entropies . while the treatment of sect .",
    "[ secexpa ] is tailored on the specific system under investigation , the following sect .",
    "[ secexpa2 ] introduces a more general approach , that confirms the results of the previous section . following these ideas , in sect .",
    "[ seccat ] we consider the case of linear automorphisms of the two - dimensional torus , that can be investigated completely .",
    "we also conjecture a general form for the constant @xmath23 over @xmath31 asymptotics described above . in the conclusions we review the new results presented in this paper .",
    "many facts concerning return times of sets are known . in this section",
    "we review a few of these results that are relevant for the understanding of this paper .",
    "if the dynamical system @xmath32 has positive metric entropy , @xmath33 , it has been proven @xcite that : @xmath34    the limit of the quantity above exists and is equal to one @xmath1-almost everywhere in certain cases , including irreducible and aperiodic subshifts of finite type , systems verifying the specification property @xcite and even non - uniformly hyperbolic maps of the interval @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of importance to study the measure of the set of points that deviate from the almost - sure behavior , a quantity that typically decays exponentially in time .",
    "to do this precisely , one defines the deviation function @xmath35 , @xmath36 in the language of the previous section this becomes @xmath37    in @xcite it has been proven that , for @xmath38-mixing dynamical systems with some restrictions ( see the original paper for definition and further specifications ) the limit above exists and is related to the generalized rnyi entropies @xmath39 of the invariant measure @xmath1 via @xmath40 whenever the latter function exists , being it defined via a summation over all cylinders @xmath41 of length @xmath22 , @xmath42 observe that meaningful values of @xmath43 in eq .",

    "( [ dev2 ] ) applies .",
    "rnyi entropies have been introduced in @xcite and they have been extensively studied for their connections with various generalized spectra of dimensions of invariant sets , see for instance @xcite . the restrictions in @xcite have been removed in @xcite and in this last paper the rnyi entropies have been proved to exist for a weaker class of @xmath38-mixing measures .    on the other hand , one might try to answer similar questions when balls are considered in place of cylinders .",
    "for instance , if @xmath9 is the ball of radius @xmath7 centered at @xmath46 , the natural generalization of the limit ( [ lmtc ] ) is the quantity @xmath47 for a large class of maps of the interval , it has been proved in @xcite that @xmath48 exists for @xmath1-almost all @xmath16 and is equal to the inverse of @xmath49 , the lyapunov exponent of the measure @xmath1 . for hyperbolic smooth diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold a similar result holds , to the extent that @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the largest and the smallest lyapunov exponents , while @xmath53 is the smallest _ positive _ lyapunov exponent and @xmath54 is the largest _ negative _ lyapunov exponent , see @xcite . in the case of diffeomorphisms in two dimensions , the above formula leads to the equality @xmath55 the last equality above is young s formula , in which @xmath56 is the information dimension and @xmath57 is the metric entropy of the measure @xmath1 .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to generalize the results ( [ smi1 ] ) , ( [ dev2 ] ) in the case of balls .",
    "in this section we take a close look at bernoulli processes , that are the simplest , yet significant , example of @xmath38-mixing systems . for these",
    ", eq . ( [ dev2 ] ) holds and the function @xmath39 can be easily computed . in our view , this result is particularly significant , because it relates a thermodynamical quantity , the spectrum of rnyi entropies , to the statistics of return times .",
    "our aim is to investigate the kind of convergence holding for eq .",
    "( [ smi1 ] ) and more generally the form of the distribution @xmath20 .",
    "we shall also introduce a slightly different quantity than @xmath58 , still based on return times , that also yields @xmath35 in the limit , but for which convergence is much faster .",
    "let us start from notations : we consider the full shift on the space of sequences of @xmath59 symbols , @xmath60 .",
    "let us stipulate that the cylinders in @xmath61 can be written as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , for @xmath64 . for short , we shall sometimes write @xmath65 for the vector of indices @xmath66 , and @xmath67 will be the length of this vector .",
    "@xmath65 is also called a `` word '' in symbolic language . with a slight abuse of notation",

    "the second is the much faster decay of @xmath82 .",
    "both these features , and more , can be explained by computing the asymptotic behavior of @xmath20 for @xmath23 fixed and large @xmath22 .    the case @xmath83 follows immediately from the observation that the only words @xmath65 for which @xmath84 are composed of a single symbol : @xmath85 for all @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
