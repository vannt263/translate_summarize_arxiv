    "hidden u(1)s arise in these scenarios from space - time filling d7-branes wrapping cycles in the extra dimensions which are not intersecting the visible sector branes ( cf .",
    "[ scenarios](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "another possibility giving rise to hidden sector u(1)s are anti d3-branes ( cf .",

    "therefore , in scenarios where the volume @xmath33 is large , the corresponding gauge coupling is small , giving rise to hyperweak interactions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , from eqs .",
    "and we estimate @xmath34 which can be tiny for @xmath35 and string scales much below the planck scale , corresponding to large bulk volumes .",
    "this can be clearly seen by looking at the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : couplingsvsms ] , where we show the estimate for the gauge coupling of a u(1 ) on a d7 brane .",
    "in contrast the gauge coupling on an ( anti ) d3 brane or a d7 brane on a collapsed cycle is unaffected by the volume suppression and therefore comparatively large , i.e. @xmath26 , as can be seen from the blue line in fig .",

    "prior to the breaking of supersymmetry , in the 4d effective theory the kinetic mixing appears as a holomorphic quantity in the gauge kinetic part of the supergravity lagrangian , @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the field strength superfields for the two u(1 ) gauge fields and @xmath38 are the holomorphic kinetic mixing parameter and gauge couplings that must run only at one loop .",
    "the well known expression for the holomorphic gauge running is = - _ r p/ , here , @xmath39 denotes the charge under group @xmath40 carried by @xmath41 fields .",
    "the physical gauge couplings are given in terms of the holomorphic quantities by the kaplunovsky - louis formula @xcite ( given here specialised to u(1 ) gauge groups ) : g_a^-2 = - _ r z^(r ) - _ r ^2 k , where @xmath42 is the renormalised kinetic energy matrix of fields having charge @xmath43 ( i.e. the renormalised khler metric @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 is the full khler potential and @xmath46 .",
    "we should expect that a similar formula should be obeyed for the kinetic mixing , too .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that the relevant expression , exact to all orders in perturbation theory , is = ( _ ab^h ) + ( q_a q_b z ) + _ r n_r q_a q_b ( r)^2 k , [ kltypeformula]where @xmath47 is now the parameter in the canonical lagrangian density _ d^2 \\ { w_a w_a + w_b w_b - _ ab w_a w_b } .",
    "this is easiest to understand using the techniques of @xcite ; it is a consequence of rescaling the vector superfields from the holomorphic basis ( where the gauge kinetic terms are as above ) to the canonical basis , @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , the analysis used there follows through exactly for the kinetic mixing ( with the exception of the supergravity contribution proportional to the full khler potential ) .",
    "apart from the applications in this paper , the above formula can be used to derive the running of couplings for several u(1 ) factors to specified orders in perturbation theory , such as in @xcite .",
    "it is worth also noting that the same formalism also describes `` magnetic mixing ''  @xcite . defining @xmath49 and similarly for @xmath50 ,",
    "there are terms in the lagrangian density f_^a ^a , + f_^b ^b - f_^a ^b , where a tilde denotes the dual field strength , and @xmath51 is the `` magnetic - mixing '' angle , ( _ ab ) = . we then find a `` physical '' magnetic mixing in analogy to the above ; the resulting canonical lagrangian density is @xcite _ f_^a^a + f_^b ^b - f_^a ^b .",
    "since @xmath52 run only at one loop , the same is true of @xmath53 , with the `` physical '' quantities obtaining corrections only through the modification of the gauge coupling .",
    "so far we have considered the form of the gauge coupling in 4d supergravity .",
    "further information can be obtained by dimensional reduction from the original 10 dimensions .",
    "in particular , moduli fields will now appear .",
    "again , we will specialize to the case of a iib setup .    as reviewed in appendix [",
    "appendix : effective ] , in large volume type iib models , the gauge groups are supported on d7 branes , which wrap four - cycles @xmath54 corresponding to the @xmath55 khler moduli @xmath56 , but may in addition support magnetic fluxes wrapping two - cycles @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 depends upon the moduli , both closed and open .",
    "the closed string khler moduli @xmath59 transform under peccei - quinn symmetries ( which lead to discrete shifts of their imaginary parts ) .",
    "therefore , they can only enter as exponentials .",
    "however , they also depend upon the inverse string coupling @xcite ( see equation ( [ effective : kaehlerdef ] ) and the text below it ) and consequently an exponential dependence would be non - perturbative .",
    "thus they _ can not _ enter at 1-loop .",
    "accordingly , @xmath47 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the complex structure moduli , and @xmath62 are the open string moduli .",
    "the above is in analogy to the structure of gauge kinetic functions , see for example @xcite .",
    "generically , the @xmath61 enter the holomorphic kinetic mixing in polynomial or exponential form ( for example in the explicit example of toroidal models they enter via powers of exponentials  @xcite ) and will typically be numbers of order one , although certain may be exponentially small at the end of a warped throat  @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that generically @xmath63 using the above expression ( [ kltypeformula ] ) to compute the canonical kinetic mixing and the fact that , for a hidden u(1 ) separated by distances greater than the string scale from the hypercharge there are no light states connecting them ( i.e. charged under both ) and thus no contributions from the khler potential , we expect a kinetic mixing of order @xmath64    this is one of our main results . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chivsms ] , we display the predictions of kinetic mixing for the two first scenarios of hidden u(1)s shown in fig .",
    "[ scenarios ] , as a function of the string scale , which we vary from the tev scale up to the gut scale . for the case of a hyperweak u(1 ) , realized by the geometric setup in fig .  [ scenarios ] ( a ) , quite interesting values for kinetic mixing are predicted , @xmath65 as is apparent from the red band in fig .",
    "[ fig : chivsms ] and a comparison with the present phenomenological limits in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_limits ] .",
    "even larger values are predicted if the hidden u(1 ) sits on a collapsed cycle , as in fig .",
    "[ scenarios ] ( b ) , because the hidden gauge coupling is in this case just of order one , irrespective of the string scale .",
    "the corresponding estimate is the blue band in fig .",
    "[ fig : chivsms ] .",
    "so far , we have discussed the generic expectation for kinetic mixing between the visible u(1 ) and a hidden u(1 ) in large volume string compactifications .",
    "much smaller values could result in special cases where the one - loop contribution is cancelled or vanishes .",
    "they arise from a non - perturbative contribution which would be suppressed by a factor of @xmath66 for some @xmath67 . in the following subsection [ special",
    "] we will therefore briefly check when this could happen .",
    "another suppression of the mixing could result from effects from the khler potential corrections in  .",
    "those become effective , however , only in the case when the hyperweak brane intersects the standard model brane and there are states charged under both hypercharge and the hyperweak group .",
    "we argued previously that the generic value for the holomorphic kinetic mixing parameter is @xmath68 .",
    "however , there are certain cases where it may vanish , and we must carefully examine the details of the compactification .",
    "firstly there exists the simplest case , that we have a toroidal model with parallel branes without magnetic fluxes ( this forced the calculations of @xcite to specialise to the mixing between branes and antibranes ) . in this case",
    "it is the fact that the messenger fields stretching between the branes fall into @xmath69 multiplets that effects the cancellation ( recall that the calculation is similar to that of gauge threshold corrections , and the cancellation thus follows from the vanishing beta function for @xmath69 supersymmetry ) .",
    "however , this is somewhat misleading , since on a general calabi - yau manifold ( rather than an orbifold of the torus ) there can only be two supersymmetries , and we can therefore assume that even in the case of parallel branes in such cases we will have non - vanishing masses and mixings .",
    "the second case is cancellations due to orientifold images .",
    "if we are calculating the mixing between two branes @xmath40 and @xmath70 and their images in the upstairs geometry @xmath71 and @xmath72 , then for usp - type projections the mixing will be @xmath73 ( for so - type projections the signs will all be positive and we can thus expect a mixing unless the branes lie on the orientifold planes ) . clearly if either brane @xmath40 or @xmath70 lies on the orientifold plane and",
    "its gauge bundle is invariant then this will vanish .",
    "other than this case and the special case of toroidal models , however , we generically expect @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , as discussed in @xcite , the technique of displacing away from orientifold planes merely cancels the mass for the u(1 ) , whilst allowing for kinetic mixing .",
    "the third , final and most important case is that the massless u(1 ) , i.e. the visible u(1 ) , crucially resides on a single stack of branes broken by giving a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to one type of magnetic flux , such as that considered in local iib and f - theory guts  @xcite . for example , with a stack of five d7-branes wrapping a divisor @xmath75 and making an su(5 ) group , we can turn on a flux vev for one element of @xmath76 ( trivial on the overall calabi - yau to ensure the u(1 ) is massless ) proportional to @xmath77 in the gauge indices , which breaks the model to su(3)@xmath78su(2)@xmath78u(1 ) .",
    "we can view the u(1 ) as two u(1)s with field strengths @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "an additional non - trivial flux can be turned on to make the trace - u(1 ) massive .    in these models , we can analyse the closed string fields that mediate the mixing and determine whether it will vanish .",
    "the relevant couplings arise from the dimensional reduction of the chern - simons action in eqs .",
    "( [ effective : dbi]),([effective : sdbi ] ) and are given by @xmath81\\nonumber\\\\ + & [ { \\rm vis}\\leftrightarrow { \\rm hidden } ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 are the four and , for future use , six - dimensional hodge star operators respectively , @xmath83 is the khler form on the compact dimensions , we have defined @xmath84 to be the two - form 4-d ( @xmath85 ) component of the @xmath86 r - r @xmath87-forms , and @xmath88 are the @xmath89 form 6-d ( @xmath90 ) components ; @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 is the first chern class of the line bundle @xmath93 .",
    "it is equal to the curvature two - form divided by @xmath94 and this is equal to the full higher dimensional fields strength . on the visible brane",
    "the gut group is broken by @xmath95 and we find @xmath96 .",
    "we are now interested in the cross terms between the visible and the hidden parts of eq .  .",
    "since the gut group is broken only by the fluxes , any contribution that is not dependent on the internal fluxes will cancel due to the tracelessness of the hypercharge .",
    "this removes the six - form and the @xmath97 piece coupling to the antisymmetric tensor @xmath98 .",
    "then we can see that the remaining @xmath98 piece exactly cancels with the @xmath99 contribution since they are scalars on the calabi - yau .",
    "this leaves only two potential contributions : where the @xmath98 field couples to the flux on the visible brane but @xmath100 on the hidden brane ( i.e. only applicable for hidden photons with non - zero chan - paton traces on at least one stack of branes ) and that coming from the axion @xmath101 .",
    "the d7 brane wraps a divisor @xmath75 in the compact space , and once we have introduced a gut - breaking flux , the integral @xmath102 ( this contributes to the d3-brane tadpole ) , every component of the @xmath98 field that is non - vanishing at the two - cycle dual to @xmath103 couples it to branes with non - vanishing chan - paton trace ( note that the two - cycle must have zero volume if the manifold is khler ) .",
    "thus we expect our hyperweak gauge group to have a kinetic mixing with the hypercharge provided it does not have a similar gut - breaking flux , since it does not lie on an orientifold plane ( otherwise it would not carry a u(1 ) ) .    to establish whether the final contribution will vanish ,",
    "i.e. whether the hypercharge will mix with hidden u(1)s at singularities similar to the visible one , we must understand the propagation of the r - r forms on the calabi - yau space .",
    "the calculation of kinetic mixing can be interpreted as the integrating out of the form by its equation of motion ; we wish to solve ( k^2 + d d ) z_2 = a_1^k _ ( [ d_1 ] c_1 ( _ 1 ) ) + a_2^k _ ( [ d_2 ] c_1 ( _ 2 ) ) and extract the piece proportional to @xmath104 ( since the zero mode gives us the masses ) . in fact , the above should reduce to finding the green function of the laplacian on the compact space once we take into account gauge fixing of the forms under @xmath105 .",
    "we then need to examine the eigenforms of the laplacian @xmath106 .",
    "a given eigenform will then mediate mixing if @xmath107 , where @xmath108 are the two - cycles on the divisors @xmath109 dual to @xmath92 . if @xmath110 is trivial , then @xmath111 , so we expect non - zero modes to contribute .",
    "however , since @xmath112 have zero volume on a khler manifold , this requires @xmath113 to be singular .",
    "this implies that generically this contribution will be zero unless @xmath114 ( similar to the setup of @xcite ) i.e. the three - cycle @xmath40 should extend into the bulk and connect the two hidden sectors .",
    "this is similar to gauge threshold corrections @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we generically expect a non - vanishing kinetic mixing between the visible u(1 ) and a hyperweak one ( scenario shown in fig .",
    "[ scenario1 ] ) . in the mixing between the visible u(1 ) and a hidden u(1 ) on a collapsed cycle ( cf .",
    "[ scenario2 ] ) cancellations may occur but there are also setups of this type where we expect non - vanishing kinetic mixing .",
    "in addition to supersymmetric kinetic mixing contributions , there will also be those coming from supersymmetry breaking effects .",
    "the first kind , extensively discussed in @xcite , is that from mixing between branes and anti - branes . in large volume models where the uplift to a de sitter vacuum is provided by @xmath115-branes ( cf .",
    "@xcite and fig .",
    "[ scenarios ] ( c ) ) , the predicted hidden u(1)s will generically mix with u(1)s with a term that is volume suppressed but may not obtain a stckelberg mass ( cf .",
    "[ stueck ] ) since the @xmath98 and @xmath99 zero modes are projected out . from the analysis above , we can see that these will mix with the hypercharge even in a gut model , since the @xmath98 and @xmath99 contributions now have the same sign and couple to @xmath116 on the visible d7 brane .",
    "the mixing thus generically has magnitude @xcite _",
    "d7_v ~ , giving @xmath117 for tev strings and @xmath118 for @xmath21 gev .",
    "this is shown as the turquoise band in fig .",
    "[ fig : chivsms_susybroken ] .",
    "it should be emphasized here that , for tev strings , this prediction fits very well to the region phenomenologically favored by a possible explanation of excesses in galactic cosmic ray data through decaying hidden photino dark matter ( item 5 in the introduction ) . since uplifting to a de sitter space is a phenomenological necessity , this a very interesting result .",
    "however , the introduction of anti d3-branes is not the only way to uplift .",
    "it may also be performed through @xmath119-terms  @xcite or @xmath75-terms on supersymmetric branes  @xcite .    in cases",
    "where the supersymmetric contribution to kinetic mixing vanishes , we may yet generate khler potential corrections yielding kinetic mixing , at much smaller values than ( [ susykmestimate ] ) , where the gauge bosons couple to the @xmath119- and @xmath75-terms @xmath120 that break supersymmetry via @xmath121 where the scale @xmath122 can be set to the string scale , with the coefficients absorbing the quantitative information .",
    "there is no term of @xmath123 since there is no operator that can generate it : the above are generated by corrections to the khler potential of the form @xmath124 note that the above is schematic ; the full set of operators involves permuting the insertions of superspace derivatives @xmath125 etc .. now , in large volume models , of the gravity - mediated contributions only the dilaton and khler moduli obtain @xmath119-terms , and @xmath75-terms are initially considered to vanish , but then are corrected by uplifting - and , of course , the higgs vev gives a @xmath75-term to the hypercharge .",
    "following @xcite , we shall assume that there are three classes of cycles with corresponding khler moduli : `` large '' cycles @xmath126 , `` small '' cycles ( which intersect no others and are wrapped by a d3-brane instanton @xmath127 , and collapsed `` matter '' cycles @xmath128 .",
    "we will also denote hidden `` collapsed '' cycles @xmath129 .",

    "we would now like to estimate the coefficients appearing in equations , , , and determine whether they might vanish .",
    "firstly , we should note that if the @xmath119-term spurions are the khler moduli @xmath138 then they will have axionic couplings to gauge fields ; the expressions should then be a function of terms like @xmath139 .",
    "however , replacing @xmath140 in eq .",
    "with @xmath141 yields a term with three gauge fields .",
    "this is excluded by furry s theorem .",
    "consequently , terms of the form , are excluded , too .",
    "in addition , from the cft point of view it is possible to see that such an amplitude is forbidden by worldsheet charge conservation .",
    "we can then turn to cft computations on toroidal backgrounds to estimate the magnitude of the coefficients .",
    "let us now turn to the contribution  , . since we have already argued that the visible sector should always mix supersymmetrically with a hyperweak gauge group , we shall focus on interactions between branes at fixed points of orbifolds .",
    "a calculation involves the scattering of two gauge bosons and the appropriate @xmath75 or @xmath119 term vertex operators , and includes contributions from @xmath69 and @xmath142 sectors .",
    "the presence of @xmath142 sectors implies shared cycles , which as we also argued yields supersymmetric mixing .",
    "so we need only consider the @xmath69 sectors , which are identical to the interaction between d3-branes except for chan - paton factors . however , since the operators corresponding to the khler modulus and dilaton @xmath119-terms do not carry chan - paton factors , and the @xmath69 sector amplitude is independent of the fluxes on the branes , we conclude that the contributions to ( [ special : secondorderf ] ) cancel .",
    "turning now to the @xmath75-terms , we shall restrict our attention to the contributions to ( [ special : secondorderd ] ) of vanish .",
    "this forbids terms where the @xmath75-terms arise from a ( broken ) non - abelian u(1 ) .",

    "note that we consider only the case with two different u(1)s in the operator .",
    "in string theory a particle can be charged only under two u(1)s .",
    "therefore , operators with more than two different u(1)s can appear only at two or more loops .    to determine the mass scale @xmath122 appearing in the above we can attempt a calculation for toroidal orientifolds .",
    "one method to obtain the coefficient is to calculate the scattering amplitude of four gauge bosons ; conveniently this has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the result for the @xmath69 sector , as discussed in appendix [ appendix : toroidal ] , is ~ , up to an order one constant .",
    "the key is that the @xmath69 sectors will always be present since they are mediated by untwisted modes , linking two hidden sectors , and provides a lower bound upon the mixing .    of course",

    "the two natural values that we shall take for our hidden gauge couplings @xmath149 are then the electroweak value , @xmath198 , and the hyperweak one , @xmath199 .    breaking the u(1 ) with a hidden higgs mechanism leads to some interesting features such as , e.g. , the existence of a hidden higgs which can be phenomenologically interesting .",
    "we will discuss this and the constraints on the hidden higgs from the underlying susy in the next subsection . then we will estimate the possible range of soft masses that will set the scale for the hidden higgs vev .",

    "[ mcps ] . from a phenomenological point of view : in hyperweak scenarios searching for a massive hidden photon is a competitive and sometimes even more sensitive probe of the extra gauge group than searching for a minicharged higgs or other minicharged hidden matter .      in a setup with hyperweak interactions , it is naively straightforward to obtain a light u(1 ) : @xmath208 where @xmath209 is a hidden sector higgs .    using the hyperweak gauge coupling @xmath210 for a low string scale @xmath211 and a vev for the hidden higgs of the order of @xmath212",
    "this immediately suggests a very interesting mass in the ev regime and a kinetic mixing @xmath213 .",
    "however , since we are dealing with a supersymmetric theory we have to be slightly more careful .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "typically , @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the negative mass - squared responsible for the higgs vev , @xmath216 is the quartic hidden higgs coupling and @xmath217 is the ( physical ) mass of the hidden higgs .",
    "typically naturalness arguments are based on an argument that @xmath218 and therefore @xmath219 .",
    "but , this naive argument fails in supersymmetric models with hyperweak gauge interactions because @xmath220 using this and the fact that we expect the negative mass - squared to be roughly of the same order as the soft supersymmetry breaking masses in the hidden sector we get our generic expectation , @xmath221 in particular , we typically do not expect a hierarchy between the hidden higgs mass and the hidden photon mass .",
    "let us confirm this expectation by looking at the minimal model of one hidden higgs pair @xmath222 charged only under the hidden u(1 ) with opposite charges @xmath223 , since softly broken supersymmetry dictates that the potential is v = m_1 ^ 2 |h_1|^2 + m_2 ^ 2    [ minmalhiggsv ] where @xmath224 is a fayet - iliopolous term .",
    "if @xmath225 then the symmetry breaking is as in @xcite and we find @xmath226 . as expected this allows no hierarchy between the gauge boson and higgs masses , so we may not obtain lighter hidden gauge bosons .",
    "if we assume @xmath227 then the higgs masses are @xmath228 . if we set @xmath229 or equivalently relatively increase the masses @xmath230 , then we find a very similar situation ; the lightest higgs is naturally of similar mass to the heavy gauge bosons .",
    "schematically we find @xmath231 , @xmath232 .",
    "we can not have simultaneously a light hidden gauge boson and comparatively heavy higgs without a substantial degree of fine tuning .",
    "this is analogous to the situation in the mssm .",
    "clearly this is a result of supersymmetry dictating the size of the quartic coupling for this minimal situation .",
    "however , the large volume scenario need not give us the minimal scenario .",
    "in subsection [ stringscenarios ] we shall consider what types of higgs fields may appear in large volume compactifications and how they might turn out to be heavier than the hidden photon .",
    "finally let us note , that the case when hidden higgs does not acquire a vacuum expectation value is interesting in itself . in this case",
    "the hidden photon is massless ( unless it gets a mass from the stckelberg mechanism ) and the hidden higgs is nothing but a charged hidden matter particle .",
    "it then behaves as a minicharged particle with @xmath233 if the gauge coupling @xmath149 is hyperweak this particle has an interesting phenomenology as it behaves in many situations as if the hidden photon is not present ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have seen that the mass scale of the hidden photon is typically given by the soft masses @xmath234 arising from supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector .",
    "let us now turn to estimating the size of these soft masses in various scenarios of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "let us start with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking . in a simple scenario of this type , @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the typical scale of soft supersymmetry breaking masses in the visible ,",
    "i.e. electroweak , sector and @xmath237 is the supersymmetry breaking in a sequestered supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "moreover , @xmath238 is the mass of the messengers .",
    "naturally we expect that @xmath236 sets the scale for electroweak symmetry breaking ( with possibly an additional factor @xmath239 ) .",
    "we can now apply the same line of reasoning to the hidden sector . in principle",
    "we have two possibilities :    * the hidden sector couples directly ( via its hyperweak interaction ) to the sequestered susy breaking sector , @xmath240 this assumes the most conservative choice of messenger properties ; that the supersymmetry breaking scale and messenger masses are identical to those of the visible sector .",
    "of course , there is no a priori reason for this to be true , and we can therefore envisage that there is a very large range of hidden soft masses generated this way . * the hidden sector couples only indirectly via the kinetic mixing with the electromagnetic ( hypercharge ) u(1 ) to the sequestered susy breaking sector .",
    "this is the case considered in @xcite , where it transpires that the `` semi - direct mediation '' via the @xmath75-term of the hypercharge induces an effective fayet - iliopoulos term for the hidden gauge group @xmath224 of _ h = d_y and thus generate masses of magnitude ( including some tachyonic ) ( m^hid_soft)^2 = q_h g_h d_y = q_h g_h g_y v^2 2 ( m^vis_soft)^2 . this dominates over the `` little gauge mediation '' contributions @xmath241 in fact , the scenario of @xcite which is of particular phenomenological interest in the context of hidden sector dark matter ( see item 3 in the introduction and references therein and the region labeled  unified dm \" in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_limits ] ) can be easily realised if we locate the hidden sector on a collapsed cycle analagous to the standard model cycle ( as in fig .",
    "[ scenarios](b ) ) , so that @xmath242 and we obtain a hidden u(1 ) mass of @xmath243 .",
    "the model requires @xmath244 , which corresponds to the supersymmetric contribution @xmath245 , and thus from the earlier discussion we conclude that this scenario can be realised if the hidden and visible sectors have a homologous collapsed two - cycle .    in fig .",
    "[ softmasses ] we show the typical hidden sector soft masses arising via gauge mediation as a function of the string scale , for the minimal choice of messenger sector ; less minimal choices would lead to an even wider range of values .",
    "the red areas are for hyperweak hidden sectors whereas the blue areas correspond to hidden sectors on collapsed cycles with gauge couplings of strength @xmath26 .",
    "darker shades correspond to the mediation via mechanism ( a ) and lighter shades to mechanism ( b ) .",
    "overall we note that in gauge mediation scenarios the soft masses in the hidden sector can be many orders of magnitude smaller than those in the visible sector , in particular if the gauge coupling is hyperweak .",
    "[ softgauge ]      we should however keep in mind that in addition to the gauge mediation contributions there is always an unavoidable contribution from gravity mediation , but we may not simply take the naive contributions to the soft mssm and gravitino masses .",
    "this is because while all @xmath119 terms effectively couple to the gravitino , not all @xmath119 terms couple at tree level to the matter fields .",
    "soft masses for fields with diagonal khler metric @xmath246 are given by m_soft,^2 = ( m_3/2 ^ 2 + ) - ^ f^n _ _ n k _ , where @xmath247 is the vacuum expectation value of the potential . for states with generic volume dependence of their khler metric @xmath248",
    "we have for @xmath249 m_soft,^2 ~ m_3/2 ^ 2 . [ leadingmass ] in gauge mediation scenarios the susy breaking of size @xmath250 in the sequestered sector would give a contribution of size @xmath251 to the gravitino mass .",
    "but the gravitino mass could of course be bigger because there could be susy breaking that is not coupled via gauge mediation .",
    "for example , for @xmath252 ( as we shall later find corresponding to higgs localised on large cycles ) we then find a tachyonic mass @xmath253 .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , for fields on a collapsed cycle such as a `` collapsed - collapsed '' or a `` collapsed - large '' higgs field , which have khler metric @xmath254 , and assuming @xmath255 , the leading terms in the above equation cancel , and we have a naive contribution from gravity mediation which is much smaller , [ gravsupp1 ] m_soft,^2 ~m_3/2 ^ 2 . however , in @xcite it was conjectured that the khler metric for chiral matter at collapsed cycles may actually be [ gravsupp2 ] k _ = e^k/3 , where @xmath45 is the khler potential of the moduli .",
    "this would then cancel the soft masses from gravity mediation exactly , leaving only higher order corrections .",
    "these must then be compared to any gauge or anomaly mediated contribution .",
    "the conclusion is that the gravity mediated soft masses may be almost independent of the gravitino mass , and that if we take the visible sector soft terms to arise from gravity mediation then this provides a lower bound for any hidden sector terms .",
    "on the other hand , if the visible susy breaking arises from gauge mediation the soft masses arising from gravity mediation in the hidden sector could be nearly arbitrarily small .",
    "having discussed our expectations for the scale of the hidden photon and hidden higgs masses arising in scenarios with hidden higgses let us now turn to concrete string realizations . in this context",
    "we will also keep an eye on the possibility that we can obtain larger higgs masses than the naive expectation @xmath256 .    hidden higgs fields , being scalars ,",
    "must occur at the intersection between two branes , although this includes intersections with orientifold images .",
    "since the branes wrap four - dimensional divisors on the calabi - yau space , they either overlap ( for `` collapsed - collapsed '' brane matter ) , having a four - dimensional intersection , or their intersections are two - dimensional curves ( riemann surfaces ) ; this occurs for `` large - large '' and `` large - collapsed '' matter . using the knowledge that the chiral wavefunctions are localised at the intersection and that the wilsonian yukawa couplings do not depend upon the khler moduli , this allows us to estimate the scaling of the khler potential with the cycle volumes . for the states on two - dimensional intersections , if we rescale @xmath257 , then since @xmath258 we must rescale all of the two - cycles that comprise @xmath129 ; then the intersection will rescale as @xmath259 .",
    "we shall take the khler potential for chiral fields to have volume dependence of @xmath260 where the @xmath261 states are analagous to d3-d7 states in a local orbifold model , and thus we have the above dependence @xcite .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that we have a vector - like pair of hidden higgs fields at the intersection of the large cycle with its orientifold image .",
    "the number of vector - like higgs fields @xmath262 is counted by @xmath263 $ ] where @xmath264 is the curve over which the brane and image intersect ; this is given by the two - cycle @xmath265 , where c^i = _ i. then , since we are perturbatively allowed a @xmath266 term , we find the scaling with volume of the khler potential of such states , since the intersection grows as @xmath267 , is k^(bb ) ~^-1 .",
    "this leads to a tachyonic gravity - mediated mass using equation ( [ leadingmass ] ) for the higgs pair of m_h_h^2 ~- m_3/2 ^ 2 .",
    "in such a scenario , we can also consider the possibility that the large cycle is not rigid , allowing an adjoint singlet @xmath268 .",
    "since we are not concerned about the hidden u(1 ) unifying into a larger gauge group , and that the cycle can be potentially stabilised by supersymmetry breaking effects , it is reasonable to consider this possibility .",
    "in such a case , there will be a holomorphic yukawa coupling to the vector higgs pair of w _",
    "h_h _ h. by dimensional reduction of the dirac - born - infeld action , the adjoint khler potential scales as @xmath269 , and thus the gravity - mediated mass generated for it , using equation ( [ leadingmass ] ) , is m_s_h^2 ~2 m_3/2 ^ 2 .",
    "this is large and positive , stabilising the adjoint at zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "then , as shown in @xcite in the context of global supersymmetry , we have an additional contribution to the physical ( i.e. normalised ) higgs quartic coupling of [ quartichiggs ] v h_h^2 _ h^2 , after integrating out the scalars for @xmath268",
    ". this can allow an increase in the hidden higgs mass compared to the naive expectation .",
    "however , note that in eq .",
    "the coupling scales like @xmath270  so we would nt expect an increase by orders of magnitude .",
    "this is because for a very specific value of the ( holomorphic and thus khler modulus independent ) @xmath271 the fields are @xmath142 supersymmetric .",
    "this occurs when the physical coupling @xmath272 ( assuming the hidden higgs field has charge @xmath223 under the hidden gauge group ) .",
    "since there is no such @xmath142 symmetry for a general calabi - yau orientifold , we generically expect @xmath271 to differ from this value  possibly allowing for a significant increase of the hidden higgs mass .",
    "we can also consider the higgs to be a chiral state , intersecting the hyperweak brane and a hidden cycle . in string models",
    "we find that chiral higgs , in contrast to a higgs pair stretching between brane and orientifold image as above , will always be charged under an additional gauge group ( which may be anomalous ) .",
    "if this group has a coupling @xmath273 that is not hyperweak ( i.e. if the hidden higgs is at an intersection between the hyperweak gauge group and a hidden sector on collapsed cycles - exactly the place where the gravity mediated masses may be acceptable ) then we have an additional quartic coupling contribution and the higgs masses will be enhanced relative to their vev . however , if this gauge group is massless , then we will find a rank one mass matrix for the two gauge bosons , i.e. one linear combination will remain massless , as in the mssm .",
    "the natural remedy for this is that they are charged under an additional hidden broken u(1 ) that has a mass from the stckelberg mechanism . for an appropriate stckelberg mass",
    ", we then expect the hidden higgs breaking to give @xmath274",
    ". however , we must be careful since the stckelberg couplings , being supersymmetric , affect the @xmath75-terms .",
    "we saw in section [ stueck ] that stckelberg masses are generated by the coupling of space - time two - forms to the gauge fields ; these two - forms are associated to either orientifold - even two - forms or odd four - forms on the compact space .",
    "however , space - time two - forms are dual to scalars , and it is the scalars that appear in the supergravity lagrangian , as the lowest components of linear multiplets . however , they can be equivalently written in terms of chiral multiplets , and as this is the form that the moduli are usually written in the literature we shall follow this convention .",
    "the couplings @xmath275 are proportional to the string mass and numerical factors ( depending on the magnetic fluxes and cycles wrapped ) but not the volume or string coupling . when we dualise ( keeping the discussion general so that the superfield is @xmath276 , where @xmath86 is the axion and @xmath277 a modulus ) we find the khler potential to quadratic order is k k_ij ( x_i + _ i + 2_ik g_k v_k)(x_j + _ j + 2_jl g_l v_l ) , where @xmath278 are the chiral superfields with couplings @xmath279 . the khler potential @xmath280 , the inverse of @xmath164 in",

    "only two - forms will yield masses suppressed relative to the string scale for branes on collapsed cycles , and so this is the case to which we shall restrict ourselves .",

    "finally , let us also note that the hidden higgs could also remain vev - less .",

    "here we shall briefly review the low energy field theory of type iib strings relevant for large volume compactifications ; for a more complete treatment see for example @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the ten - dimensional bosonic action @xmath301 where in the string basis the propagating degrees of freedom are the metric variations @xmath302 , antisymmetric tensor @xmath303 , dilaton @xmath304 ( where @xmath305 ) and @xmath306 @xmath307-forms @xmath308}$ ] , and the field strengths h_3 d b_2 , f_1 d c_0 , f_p+1 d c_p - c_p-2 h_3 , and @xmath309 must be imposed on the equations of motion .",
    "note that the above action ( [ effective:10diib ] ) does not have a canonical einstein - hilbert term when the dilaton is treated as a dynamical field .",
    "one approach to remedy this is to rescale to the `` einstein metric '' @xmath310 ( note that @xmath311 under @xmath312 ) .",
    "note that the kinetic terms of @xmath307-forms rescale as @xmath313 and the dilaton obtains a canonical kinetic term . with the new metric the volume rescales so that @xmath314 .",
    "the above is supplemented by the d - brane actions @xmath315 here @xmath316 are the @xmath317-roof genus associated with respectively the tangent and normal bundles on the d - brane , particularly relevant when the volume of the brane is small . for branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles ( the only case we consider in this work ) the first , dirac - born - infeld term above becomes @xmath318 where the integration is over the visible four dimensions ( hence the subscripts denote the four - dimensional metric and antisymmetric tensor ) and @xmath189 is the central charge z = _ [ dp ] , where we integrate only over the compact cycle wrapped by the d@xmath307 brane .",
    "the above can then be dimensionally reduced , keeping only the massless modes ; we find scalars , vectors and pseudoscalars according to zero , one or two indices on the non - compact dimensions respectively .",
    "the metric variations can be decomposed in terms of four - dimensional fields as @xmath319 where @xmath85 are the coordinates on minkowski space ; @xmath83 is the khler form ; @xmath320 a basis of the cohomology group @xmath321 ; @xmath322 some coordinates on the calabi - yau ; @xmath323 the holomorphic three - form ; and @xmath324 a basis of @xmath325 .",
    "@xmath326 is a set of complex scalars ; @xmath326 and @xmath327 are then the fields corresponding to variations of the calabi - yau metric .",
    "note that we define all of the fields to be dimensionless .",
    "next we examine the form potentials , @xmath328 here @xmath329 is a basis of @xmath330 ; and @xmath331 are a symplectic basis of three cycles , @xmath45 running from @xmath291 to @xmath332 .",
    "we then see that the @xmath326 and @xmath333 must form the scalar and vector part of @xmath334 vector multiplets making the complex structure moduli fields , while @xmath335 form the four real scalars of a set of @xmath336 hypermultiplets which comprise the khler moduli .",
    "we then introduce an orientifold projection @xmath337 where @xmath338 is the left - moving worldsheet fermion number for excitations on minkowski coordinates invariant but under which @xmath339 are odd . ] ; @xmath340 is worldsheet parity reversal are even and @xmath341 are odd due to the difference of gso projections between left and right moving sectors in iib . ] ; and @xmath342 is the pull - back of an isometry @xmath343 ( with @xmath344 ) of the calabi - yau manifold onto differential forms are even and @xmath345 are odd . ] .",
    "the action of @xmath342 on the khler form is @xmath346 and on the holomorphic three - form @xmath347 .",
    "this generates @xmath348 and @xmath349 planes ( for @xmath350 we would have @xmath351 and @xmath352 planes ) .",
    "the cohomology groups @xmath353 then split into @xmath354 according to their eigenvalue under @xmath342 . we can then split @xmath321 into @xmath355 with basis @xmath356 and @xmath357 with basis @xmath358 according to their eigenvalues ; there is then a corresponding basis @xmath359 of @xmath360 and @xmath361 respectively .",
    "note that these are dual to the @xmath362 ; @xmath363    for the three - forms , since @xmath343 is a holomorphic involution that commutes with the hodge @xmath364 operation , we find @xmath365 . clearly since the holomorphic three - form is unique and odd under the involution we find @xmath366 . of the metric variations ,",
    "clearly since the khler form is even only the @xmath355 elements survive ( @xmath367 ) ; while for the complex structure variations it is the odd elements since the holomorphic three - form is odd ( @xmath368 ) . then the surviving form fields are @xmath369 here it is worth noting that @xmath370 and thus the invariant states @xmath371 are actually _ real _ fields , with @xmath372 being a real symplectic basis of @xmath373 .",
    "thus we see that half of the states have been projected out .",
    "note that with the orientifold projection on the forms we can define new quantities via the intersection form ; on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath374 , the intersection form is defined in terms of a basis of two - forms @xmath375 as k_abc _ y _ a _ b _ c. after the orientifold projection , the intersection numbers @xmath376 . the volume is then given by @xmath377 which involves only positive eigenforms of @xmath342 .",
    "the metric is also affected ; g_ab _ a _ b and so @xmath378 here we have defined @xmath379 which corresponds to the volume ( in string units ) of the four - cycle dual to @xmath356 .    now if we take the surviving fields and insert them into the effective action ( [ effective:10diib ] ) we can identify the chiral superfields that are the khler coordinates on the moduli space .",
    "one finds that the khler potential is given by corrections due to @xmath380 , where @xmath381 is the euler number of @xmath374 and @xmath382 is the riemann zeta - function . ]",
    "k = - 2 - -4 where the complex fields , in addition to the complex structure moduli @xmath61 , are @xmath383 the above is given in the string frame as will appear in string effective actions from loop computations . noting that @xmath384 , the appearance of @xmath385 in front of the volume factor indicates that positive powers of the modulus @xmath59 can not appear perturbatively beyond tree level .",
    "now we note that @xmath59 has a set of shift symmetries c^a c^a + ^a , ^a ^a + k_bc b^a ^c which become gauged upon the addition of d - branes ( in fact , once we add d - branes we find that the separation between khler and complex structure moduli spaces becomes obscured , but this is not important for this work ) .",
    "therefore the khler moduli , beyond tree level , may only appear as exponentials in the superpotential , and only from non - perturbative contributions .",
    "this can also be understood as the khler moduli scalars being the lowest components of linear multiplets ( which may not perturbatively appear in the superpotential ) whereas the complex structure moduli lie in chiral multiplets .",
    "the complex structure moduli of these , with the extra degree of freedom corresponding to shifts of the holomorphic three - form @xmath386 ; this is removed by choosing a basis @xmath387 . ]",
    "@xmath61 do not have a shift symmetry and do not carry factors of the string coupling , and therefore the superpotential and gauge kinetic functions may be arbitrary functions of these .",
    "this is in contrast to the case in iia strings , where both complex and khler moduli have peccei - quinn shift symmetries .",
    "here we wish to calculate the operators ( [ special : secondorderf],[special : secondorderd ] ) for a generic renormalisable model having messenger superfields @xmath389 coupling to a pseudomodulus @xmath140 having a vev @xmath390 .",

    "we then find effective terms in the lagrangian : @xmath395 however , to find the corresponding terms in the khler potential for the @xmath119-terms we must be careful , since there may be terms of the form d^4 w^(d _ ) _ ^^ ( ) 4 d d |f_|^2 , which contains no kinetic mixing term .",
    "therefore we must compare with the scattering of a photon and a hidden photon with two auxiliary @xmath119 fields and examine the coefficient of @xmath396 .",
    "since the auxiliary fields do not couple to the fermions , the photon vertex coupling to scalars is identical to the coupling of the @xmath75 field to scalars up to a factor of the external momentum ; therefore we do not generate terms of the above form , and we conclude that the corrections to the khler potential are @xmath397\\bigg ( w^{\\alpha } w_{\\alpha}^\\prime \\ov{\\xi } d^2 ( \\xi )   + \\ov{w}_{\\dot{\\alpha } } \\ov{w}^{\\prime \\dot{\\alpha } } \\xi \\ov{d}^2 ( \\ov{\\xi } ) \\bigg)\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sum_i \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2 } \\frac{1}{m^4_i } q_{i } q_{i}^{\\prime } q_{i } q_{i}^{\\prime }   w^\\alpha w_{\\alpha}^\\prime   \\ov{w}_{\\dot{\\alpha } } \\ov{w}^{\\prime \\dot{\\alpha } } \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sum_i\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2 } \\frac{1}{3m^4_i } q_{i } q_{i } q_{i } q_{i}^{\\prime }   ( w^\\alpha w_{\\alpha } \\ov{w}_{\\dot{\\alpha } } \\ov{w}^{\\prime \\dot{\\alpha } } + w^\\alpha w_{\\alpha}^\\prime \\ov{w}_{\\dot{\\alpha } } \\ov{w}^ { \\dot{\\alpha } } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sum_i \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2 } \\frac{1}{3m^4_i } q_{i } q_{i}^\\prime q_{i}^\\prime q_{i}^{\\prime } ( w^\\alpha w_{\\alpha}^\\prime \\ov{w}_{\\dot{\\alpha}}^\\prime \\ov{w}^{\\prime \\dot{\\alpha } } + w^{\\alpha \\prime } w_{\\alpha}^\\prime \\ov{w}_{\\dot{\\alpha}}^\\prime \\ov{w}^ { \\dot{\\alpha}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "to calculate the terms in the effective action , , for a toroidal model , we can compute scattering amplitudes with the auxiliary fields .",
