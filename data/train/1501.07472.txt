    "as described in the main text , we use an effective potential that captures the important features of the depletion interaction between lock - and - key colloids .",
    "the effective interaction potential is @xmath46 where the vector between two particles is @xmath47 and their orientations are @xmath48 .",
    "our goal is to parameterise the function @xmath49 so that our simplified model accurately represents the behaviour of a mixture of hard indented colloids and ideal depletant particles .",
    "the optimal effective model would match two - body interactions exactly : @xmath50   = { \\tilde g}_0(\\bm{r}_{12},\\bm{n}_1,\\bm{n}_2 ) \\label{equ : eff}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the two - particle distribution function for the colloids , normalised so that @xmath52 at large distances .",
    "the subscript ` 0 ' indicates that this function is calculated in a dilute limit , where the colloid density is taken to zero ( at fixed depletant volume fraction @xmath14 ) .",
    "the function @xmath51 can be obtained computationally , but it depends on the distance @xmath53 and on three different angles . parameterising",
    "this non - trivial function of a four variables is rather difficult  we have used numerical simulation to identify the most important features of this function , which we incorporate into a simplified effective potential .",
    "the radial distribution function in the dilute limit may be obtained as @xmath54 where both integrals run over the entire unit sphere .",
    "[ fig : grmap ] shows an example of this function , in a situation where both lock - key and back - to - back binding are signficant .",
    "the two separate peaks indicate the different binding mechanisms , but this representation does not reveal the orientation dependence of the interaction .",
    "[ fig : coords ] shows the choice of co - ordinate system that we have used to capture this dependence . in lock - key",
    "binding , one particle plays the role of the `` lock '' and the other the `` key '' .",
    "the definition @xmath55 takes the smaller of the angles between @xmath47 and the directors @xmath48 ; the particle associated with this smaller angle plays the part of the lock .",
    "we define @xmath56 so that @xmath57 corresponds to angle between the director and a vector pointing out through the `` lip '' of the lock mouth .",
    "lock - and - key binding happens only for @xmath58 while back - to - back binding happens for @xmath59 .",
    "since back - to - back binding takes place between two convex surfaces , this part of the interaction depends weakly on angular co - ordinates , so the effective potential includes a square well of range @xmath60 in that case .",
    "the contribution to the effective potential @xmath49 is therefore @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the step function . for lock - and - key bonding ,",
    "the angular dependence is less simple , but the dominant effect can be accounted for through the angle @xmath8 , which measures the rotation of the `` key '' particle within the mouth of the lock . hence the interaction potential for lock - key binding is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the piecewise linear function of @xmath65 shown in fig .  1  of the main text .",
    "in fact , this simple function provides an almost quantitative description of the @xmath8-dependence of the effective potential  [ 38 ] .",
    "having specified the form of the effective potential , we now describe how the parameters @xmath20 are chosen .",
    "the ( effective ) second virial coefficient for the indented colloids in the presence of the depletant is  [ 39]@xmath66\\ ] ] we split @xmath67 into two pieces , associated with lock - key and back - to - back binding : @xmath68 \\nonumber \\\\ b_2^{\\rm bb } & = 2\\pi \\int_{\\sigma}^\\infty \\mathrm{d}r\\ , r^2 [ 1-g_0(r ) ] \\label{equ : b2split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these two parameters indicate the strength of the two kinds of binding . a representative plot of @xmath69 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grmap ] .",
    "the peak at @xmath70 is associated with lock - key binding , and its area sets the strength of this interaction .",
    "the peak at @xmath71 is associated with back - to - back binding .    from ( [ equ : gr ] ) , @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be written as integrals of @xmath74 .",
    "motivated by ( [ equ : eff ] ) , our procedure is therefore to choose @xmath75 so that the corresponding integrals of @xmath76 $ ] are equal to @xmath77 .",
    "these integrals are contributions to the second virial coefficient of the effective model , so we denote them by @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    since the potential is a square well and the hard - particle interactions have range at most @xmath0 , it is easily verified that @xmath80 where @xmath81 accounts for the excluded volume between two indented colloids , and @xmath82 are phase space volumes associated with the two binding modes",
    ".      to estimate @xmath69 for the system with depletant , we use the geometrical cluster algorithm ( gca ) to simulate two colloidal particles in a box , mixed with depletant , as in  [ 17 ]  ( this procedure accounts for finite - size corrections to @xmath83 ) .",
    "representative results for @xmath77 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : etalb2 ] , for several size ratios @xmath12 .",
    "as expected , these parameters become large and negative as the nanoparticle volume fraction @xmath14 increases .",
    "the corresponding quantities @xmath84 were calculated numerically by the same method , but using the effective potential instead of an explicit depletant .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lb2 ] , including fits to ( [ equ : b2eff ] ) , from which we estimate the small volume associated with lock - and - key binding to be @xmath85 .",
    "comparison of figs  [ fig : etalb2 ] and  [ fig : lb2 ] allows straightforward mapping from the depletion parameters @xmath86 to the parameters @xmath20 of the effective potential .",
    "the lock - key interactions in our system are typically strong , implying a strongly negative chemical potential and consequently a very low acceptance rate for standard particle transfers ( insertions and deletions ) in grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) simulations . to counter this we introduce an additional biased transfer update in addition to the standard one .",
    "this operates by preferentially attempting to insert an indented particles in a bound configuration around a target colloid .    to implement the `` biased insertion ''",
    ", we first pick a target colloid randomly from the existing ones in the box . the location of the centre of the colloid to be inserted",
    "is then chosen randomly from within a narrow spherical shell surrounding the target .",
    "the shell radii are chosen to represent the typical separation of bound colloids . for a given point in the shell",
    "there will be a range of solid angle for the particle director which avoids hard particle overlaps , and we choose the director of the new particle uniformly from within this range .",
    "the biasing factor needed to maintain detailed balance is therefore a product of the shell volume and the solid angle that avoids overlap .",
    "this biasing factor can also be calculated for a bound particle which is to be removed from the system , based on its separation from its bound neighbour , and so enters symmetrically in the grand canonical acceptance probabilities .",
    "our gcmc simulations sample the fluctuations in the colloid number density @xmath87 and energy density @xmath88 .",
    "well within the two - phase region , the probability distribution @xmath89 exhibits a pair of widely separated peaks centered on the coexistence densities .",
    "accordingly @xmath19 serves as an order parameter for the transition , and the coexistence densities ( binodal ) can be simply read off from the peak positions  [ 29 ] .",
    "closer to the liquid - vapor critical point , the fluctuations in @xmath19 and @xmath90 assume a universal character which can be probed via the properties of the joint distribution @xmath91  [ 29,30 ] . in models that exhibit particle hole symmetry , the order parameter distribution at criticality matches the ( independently known ) universal fixed point form of the ising magnetisation distribution @xmath92 .",
    "effecting this matching provides a means of estimating the critical parameters .",
    "however , since our model lacks particle - hole symmetry , field mixing is expected to occur .",
    "this implies that the scaling equivalent of @xmath93 is the linear combination @xmath94 [ 29,30 ] .",
    "( strictly speaking , a non - linear combination may be appropriate  40 ] , but the linear combination is a simple and practical choice . ) . to estimate",
    "the critical parameters the field mixing parameter @xmath95 must be tuned along with @xmath96 and @xmath97 such as to best match @xmath98 to @xmath99 [ 29 ] .",
    "we have used these techniques to determine the critical points and coexistence binodals for a selection of values of @xmath12 in the interval @xmath100 $ ] ; the results are shown in fig .  2(a , d )  of the main text .",
    "our universal distribution matching method also delivers estimates for the field mixing properties of the critical fluid . for @xmath23 , a satisfactory matching of the number density distribution to the ising fixed point form",
    "can be obtained as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : critical](a ) , so field mixing is negligible in this case .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath27 , no satisfactory matching can be obtained under the assumption @xmath101 .",
    "the situation is greatly improved , however , by forming the distribution of the mixed field ordering operator @xmath98 , as shown in fig .",

    "these calculations were performed at states where @xmath106 .",
    "the porous structure of the liquid at @xmath27 means that @xmath105 is greater by several orders of magnitude than the corresponding state at @xmath23 .",
    "we also show the void spaces associated with typical configuration , at @xmath104 .",
    "note that the sizes of the typical voids increase along with their volume fraction ; at @xmath27 , the largest cluster has percolated the system .",
    "in the main text , arguments based on wertheim s theory of associating fluids  [ 34 ]  were used to investigate the effects of branching and non - specific binding on phase behaviour .",
    "the theory consists of two main parts .",
    "the first is an exact representation of a fluid s partition function , where the density is decomposed as a sum of partial densities that describe particles in different local environments .",
    "the second part is an ( approximate ) thermodynamic perturbation theory ( tpt ) which facilitates explicit calculations . in [ 17 ] , we developed this theory for a system of indented colloids that forms linear chains , but both chain branching and back - to - back binding were neglected .",
    "the generalisation of this theory to include these effects is straightforward , although some book - keeping is required to keep track of the various local environments .",
    "briefly , the interaction between particles is broken down into three parts , which take care of particle overlaps , lock - and - key binding , and back - to - back interactions .",
    "this decomposition is performed at the level of the mayer @xmath107-function , so the diagrammatic expansion of the free energy contains three kinds of interaction .    within this diagrammatic expansion , wertheim s theory requires that particles be classified according to their local bonding . in practice",
    ", we keep track of the number of inward and and outward lock - and - key bonds , and the number of back - to - back bonds . the constraint ( recall fig .  3  of main text ) that each particle has at most one outward bond is enforced at the level of the diagrammatic series ( this is the key advantage of wertheim s approach ) .",
    "to develop the theory , let @xmath108 be the number of particle with @xmath3 inward bonds , @xmath109 outward bonds and @xmath110 back - to - back bonds .",
    "these are the quasispecies densities of wertheim s theory  [ 34 ] . for simplicity",
    "we assume that particles may have at most two inward lock - and - key bonds ( @xmath111 ) , at most one outward lock - and - key bond ( @xmath112 ) and at most one back - to - back bond ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "further , we assume that that particles with back - to - back bonds have no inward lock - and - key bonds and vice versa , so that only one of @xmath109 or @xmath110 may be greater than zero . even with these constraints , there are still eight distinct local environments , but the advantage of the tpt is that the various @xmath108 have fairly simple relations between them .",
    "we postpone the detailed analysis to a later work and quote only the main results , with their physical interpretation .",
    "we use the notation @xmath114 , for brevity .",
    "`` chemical equilibrium '' between free monomers and particles with a single inward bond ( and no other bonds ) means that @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the density of unoccupied lock sites ( see also the main text ) , and @xmath117 is an equilbrium constant which , at the simplest level , is equal to @xmath118 . more generally , @xmath117 may be obtained within the tpt as an integral involving the radial distribution function @xmath83 in a hard - particle reference system .",
    "chemical equilibria between other particle quasispecies yield @xmath123 where @xmath124 is an equilibrium constant for back - to - back binding , and @xmath125 is a geometrical factor that accounts for the reduced volume available when binding a second lock onto a key where a lock is already bound .",
    "( the theory provides integral expressions for these quantities ; in general we expect @xmath125 to depend weakly on the energy scales @xmath75 while @xmath126 . )",
    "the wertheim theory also builds in independence of bonds for the lock- and key - sites of a given particle .",
    "this means for example that @xmath127 , and similarly @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "since the total density @xmath19 is equal to the sum of all the partial densities @xmath131 etc , we also have @xmath132 which simply means that all key - sites must be either free or involved in some kind of bonding . combining ( [ equ : rho010],[equ : rho001 ] ) yields @xmath133 from which one may derive @xmath134",
    "this equation enforces the constraint that all lock - sites are either occupied or unoccupied , analogous to ( [ equ : key - sum ] ) .",
    "following  [ 23 ] , we obtain the pressure of the system within the tpt as a sum of two terms @xmath36 where @xmath39 is an estimate of the number of clusters in the system and @xmath135 is a contribution from the hard - particle reference system , which has a reduced pressure @xmath136 that depends on the total density @xmath19 but not on the quasispecies densities . as discussed in the main text",
    ", @xmath39 is equal to the number of clusters in the system if there are no internal loops within clusters ( in that case , formation of any bond decreases the total number of clusters by @xmath121 ) .",
    "this `` tree - like '' assumption motivates the notation @xmath39 .",
    "the theory described here gives @xmath137 to see this , note that if all clusters are tree - like then their number is equal to the difference between the total number of particles and the total number of bonds ( either lock - key or back - to - back ) .",
    "the number of lock - key bonds is @xmath138 and the number of back - to - back bonds is @xmath44 , yielding ( [ equ : tree ] ) .",
    "liquid vapour phase transitions occur if @xmath139 for some volume @xmath140 . here",
    "the derivative is taken at a constant value of the total particle number @xmath141 , but the numbers of particles within each quasispecies depend on @xmath140 .",
    "the reference contribution @xmath38 is decreasing in @xmath140 so a necessary condition for phase separation within wertheim s theory is that @xmath142 . at constant @xmath97 , @xmath39 is a simple function of @xmath19 , which implies @xmath143 , so phase separation can occur only if @xmath144 ( more precisely , one requires @xmath145 . )    the relation ( [ equ : sep - suff ] ) provides a useful necessary condition for phase separation . in particular , for the system considered here , the densities @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath44 , etc are all monotonic in @xmath19 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : mono ] below ) . in the absence of back - to - back binding",
    ", one has @xmath146 from ( [ equ : tree ] ) , the pressure is monotonic in @xmath19 , so the theory predicts that no phase transition is possible .    physically , the idea is that internal loops within bonded clusters of particles are suppressed by the directed lock - key bond and the fact that a lock - site can bind to at most one key - site .",
    "the wertheim theory captures this property .      to complete the argument that phase transitions within the theory requires @xmath147",
    ", we prove that @xmath33 and @xmath34 depend monotonically on @xmath19 . starting from ( [ equ : lock - sum ] ) , we use ( [ equ : ma ] ) to express all quantities in terms of @xmath148 , and we consider small variations in @xmath149 , obtaining @xmath150 from ( [ equ : key - sum],[equ : lock - sum ] ) , we have @xmath151 and again considering small variations in @xmath148 yields @xmath152 using ( [ equ : sum - both ] ) again gives @xmath153 it follows from ( [ equ : dr],[equ : drlk ] ) that @xmath154 and @xmath155 are both monotonic in @xmath156 , which implies that @xmath157 are both monotonic in @xmath19 , as are @xmath158 .",
    "given that @xmath159 , it follows that @xmath37 must be monotonic if @xmath160 , in which case @xmath161 and the theory predicts no phase transition ."

    "<S> fig : liq - vap](d ) closely resembles the behaviour of polymers in solution , interacting via a relatively weak non - specific attraction  @xcite . as the polymer length increases in that system , the critical point moves to lower polymer density and weaker non - specific interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these systems also exhibit strong `` field - mixing '' at the critical point  @xcite : the natural order parameter for the liquid - vapor phase transition is not the density of the system , but rather a linear combination of the density and the energy . we show evidence in appendix b that the liquid - vapor critical points of the indented colloids are in the ising universality class ( as expected ) , but with strong field - mixing , as in the polymer case  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this latter effect reflects the unusual structures of the liquid and vapor states , especially the strong asymmetry between the structures of liquid and vapour states in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : liq - vap](b , c ) , ( that is , particle - hole asymmetry ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this analogy with polymers leads to a prediction for the colloidal system : in the limit of long polymers , one expects the liquid - vapor critical point to occur at the @xmath31-temperature of the polymer  @xcite , where the chain statistics are those of a simple random walk . </S>",
    "<S> this requires a weak non - specific attraction , to overcome the excluded volume interactions that cause the polymer to swell . for the colloidal system </S>",
    "<S> , the long - polymer limit corresponds to @xmath32 , in which case one would expect the liquid - vapor critical point to occur when the non - specific ( back - to - back ) interaction @xmath5 balances the excluded volume swelling effect . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the line of critical points in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : liq - vap](a ) should tend to a non - zero value of @xmath5 , as @xmath32 , consistent with our results .    </S>",
    "<S> however , while this analogy between chains of indented colloids and linear living polymers is appealing , it misses an important feature of the colloidal system . for the particle shape considered here </S>",
    "<S> , these colloids readily form _ branched _ chains . in patchy - particle models , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of branching is sufficient to drive a liquid - vapour phase transition  @xcite , but this is not the case for lock - and - key colloids . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is the directed nature of the lock - key bond . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : network ] , we illustrate different local structures in these systems , and the construction of a bond network . </S>",
    "<S> lock - key bonds are indicated by arrows that point from the `` lock '' particle to the `` key '' . in this representation , </S>",
    "<S> the crucial feature is that a particle may have several inward bonds , but at most one outward bond . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that a cluster of particles connected by lock - key bonds may contain at most one loop , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : network](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this feature has important implications for phase behaviour  a condensed liquid phase can be stable only in the presence of percolating clusters that contain large numbers of internal loops . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be illustrated using wertheim s theory of associating fluids  @xcite , which divides particles into `` quasispecies '' according to their local bonding , and predicts the number densities associated with these species . </S>",
    "<S> for indented colloids , we define @xmath33 as the number density of unoccupied `` lock sites '' ( colloidal indentations ) , and @xmath34 as the number density of free `` key sites '' ( concave colloid surfaces ) to which no particle is bound . </S>",
    "<S> the theory provides `` mass - action '' equations which relate the numbers of bonds in the system to @xmath33 and @xmath34  @xcite : see appendix d. within wertheim s theory , the pressure @xmath35 of a fluid of clusters satifies  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an estimate of the number density of bonded clusters in the system , and @xmath38 is a contribution coming from a hard - particle reference system . </S>",
    "<S> the density @xmath39 counts the number of clusters under the assumption that they are all `` tree - like '' ( containing no loops ) . for indented colloids without back - to - back interactions </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath40 ( in the absence of loops , every cluster has exactly one unoccupied lock site ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , liquid - vapor phase transitions require @xmath41 ; it is easily shown within wertheim s theory that @xmath42 , and we expect on very general grounds that @xmath38 is increasing in @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the absence of back - to - back binding , the theory predicts that no phase transition is possible : see appendix d.    however , if we include back - to - back binding within the theory , we find @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number density of back - to - back bonds . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath33 and @xmath44 are increasing functions of @xmath19  in this case the theory predicts that phase transitions can occur only when @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> note however that if @xmath37 is negative then it no longer represents a good estimate of the number of clusters in the system : due to the construction of @xmath37 , this signifies that a proliferation of loops is necessary for condensation into a liquid phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the theory used here treats back - to - back binding in a schematic way and is therefore not quantitatively accurate . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this analysis illustrates the importance of cluster loops in liquid - vapour phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the phase transitions that occur in patchy colloids are driven by branching and do not require `` non - specific '' interactions such as the back - to - back binding considered here  this is possible because there is no difference between the `` inward '' and `` outward '' bonds shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : network ] , so there is no constraint on the number of loops within a single cluster . in those cases , </S>",
    "<S> the wertheim theory is quantitatively accurate  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these results for indented colloids illustrate the subtle role of the bonding topology in hierarchical fluids . </S>",
    "<S> we see that loops are essential for condensation  they may arise either from `` undirected '' branching ( as in patchy colloids ) or from non - specific interactions ( as in polymer - solvent criticality and indented colloids ) . </S>",
    "<S> yet another point of reference is provided by dipolar fluids  @xcite , where formation of ring ( or loop ) structures acts to _ suppress _ condensation , due to the absence of non - specific interactions between closed rings , and the low probability of branching . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while the formation of colloidal polymers may appear similar for several kinds of particle , the energy scales associated with liquid - vapor phase separation can be quite different , as can the properties of the coexisting phases .    in conclusion , indented colloids with depletion interactions support unusual liquid and vapor phases , which arise from a hierarchy of energy scales for lock - key and back - to - back binding . </S>",
    "<S> when the energy scales are well - separated , these systems also share some properties with empty liquids  @xcite , dipolar fluids  @xcite , and polymer - solvent systems  @xcite , but we emphasise that these systems have different mechanisms of condensation , due to the different topological properties of the bond network in each case . for small @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> the liquid phases of indented colloids are `` porous '' , being characterised by large percolating voids , the typical size of which can be tuned by varying the properties of the depletant fluid . </S>",
    "<S> these states resemble `` equilibrium gels '' , which are not dynamically arrested  @xcite . the fine experimental control that can be achieved by manipulation of particle shape and depletant properties  @xcite makes indented colloids ideal systems for further study in this direction .    </S>",
