    "correlators of two currents @xmath1}(x)$ ] , where @xmath1}(x)$ ] is the scalar @xmath2 , pseudo - scalar @xmath3 , vector @xmath4 , or axial - vector @xmath5 current , are important for many interesting phenomenological purposes .",
    "their low energy expansions , in particular , are of interest for applications based on sum rules @xcite like the determination of the charm and bottom quark mass from @xmath6 @xcite .    in three - loop approximation ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath7 , the moments of the taylor expansion for the four correlators were evaluated up to @xmath8 in @xcite using recursion algorithms originally suggested in @xcite .",
    "the series was evaluated in four - loop approximation up to the first physical moment @xmath9 @xcite employing the laporta algorithm @xcite .",
    "the three - loop singlet contributions have been calculated in @xcite up to the seventh and eighth moments for the axial - vector and the scalar and pseudo - scalar correlators , respectively .",
    "recently , using a completely different technique based on master differential equations @xcite , the three - loop vector correlator has been calculated up to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "higher moments of the pseudo - scalar correlator might be used to determine the impact of non - perturbative effects in the determination of quark masses from lattice calculations @xcite .    in this work",
    "we calculate the low energy expansions for the four types of correlators in order @xmath11 up to @xmath10 , including the logarithms which arise from the singlet contribution , given by double triangle diagrams .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : met ] we briefly present the methods used in the calculation , paying special attention to the singlet parts . the results are presented in section [ sec : sc ] where we also compare the explicitly calculated moments with the behavior for large powers of @xmath12 derived from the threshold region .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "the polarization functions are defined by @xmath13 with the currents @xmath14 in the low energy limit the polarization functions can be written as a series in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass of the heavy quark , @xmath17 with @xmath18    the singlet contributions @xmath19 arise from the diagrams shown in fig . [",
    "fig : dias ] .",
    "it has to be noted that these are not simple power series in @xmath20 but contain logarithms of the form @xmath21 .",
    "this logarithmic dependence on @xmath12 reflects the presence of massless cuts in the diagrams .",
    "the expansion in the limit @xmath22 can be achieved in two different ways .",
    "one possibility is to first expand the propagators and later reduce the resulting massive tadpoles to master integrals . for each order in the @xmath20-expansion two more powers of the propagators",
    "arise . for large @xmath0",
    "this makes the reduction to master integrals through the reduction formalisms of broadhurst or laporta very cumbersome .",
    "the second possibility is the reduction of the full propagators to master integrals .",
    "these master integrals have then to be known at least as an expansion in the external momentum which can be calculated efficiently to high orders . the price to pay",
    "is the increased difficulty in obtaining the necessary reduction to master integrals . in this paper",
    "we choose the latter approach , which we present in more detail in the following .    in the first step ,",
    "the diagrams are generated with ` qgraf ` @xcite .",
    "the occurring topologies are identified with the help of ` q2e ` and ` exp ` @xcite .",
    "the integrals are reduced to scalar propagator - type integrals of the form @xmath23[dk_2][dk_3]}{d_1^{a_1}d_2^{a_2}\\dots d_9^{a_9}}\\quad . \\label{propagatorintegral}\\ ] ] using the computer algebra program ` form ` @xcite .",
    "the denominators are given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a linear combination of the loop momenta @xmath26 and the external momentum @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the mass of the corresponding propagator .",
    "only one non - zero mass is taken into account for the heaviest quark , lighter quarks are treated as massless .",
    "the powers @xmath29 of the denominators are integers .",
    "irreducible scalar products are expressed as propagators with negative powers .",
    "the integrals are dimensionally regularized in space - time dimension @xmath30 .    in a next step ,",
    "integration - by - parts @xcite and laporta s algorithm @xcite are used to reduce all needed integrals of the form ( [ propagatorintegral ] ) to master integrals .",
    "this reduction is done with the program ` crusher ` @xcite . `",
    "crusher ` uses ` ginac ` @xcite for algebraic manipulations and ` fermat ` @xcite for the simplification of the intermediate expressions using a special interface @xcite . as a result of",
    "the reduction one finds a total of 55 master integrals .",
    "the master integrals have to be expanded for small external momenta around @xmath31 .",
    "to achieve this , we use the scaling equation @xmath32 for the master integrals @xmath33 . @xmath34",
    "applied to @xmath33 gives the mass dimension of @xmath33 . carrying out the mass derivative produces integrals with additional powers of propagators , that are again mapped to master integrals .",
    "this gives a system of coupled inhomogeneous linear differential equations in @xmath12 .",
    "for the non - singlet part , the system is solved by a taylor series @xmath35 where the coefficients @xmath36 have to be calculated .",
    "diagrammatically , the coefficients are tadpole diagrams . as boundary conditions , the three - loop master tadpoles depicted in fig .",
    "[ boundaries ] @xmath37-@xmath38 are chosen .",
    "the @xmath36 can be expressed as linear combinations of these .",
    "for the singlet part , non - integer powers of @xmath12 have to be taken into account : @xmath39 in this case , the boundary conditions for the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the diagrams depicted in fig . [ boundaries ] @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "generation and solution of the system are implemented in a ` mathematica ` program . with our setup",
    "we can calculate the @xmath12 expansion to almost arbitrary depths . in this work we limit ourselves to the first @xmath44 moments .",
    "this way of calculating expansions of integrals was proposed in @xcite and applied to the vector current in @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50    to perform the renormalization we need the strong coupling @xmath51 @xcite and the mass renormalization constant at two - loop order @xcite .    for the pseudo - scalar and axial - vector currents we have to pay special attention to the treatment of @xmath52 .",
    "while in the non - singlet contributions @xmath52 can simply be considered as anticommutating this is not possible for the singlet contributions . in the latter case",
    "the @xmath52 matrix can not easily be removed from the problem and has to be treated properly to avoid problems with dimensional regularization .",
    "therefore we follow the prescription proposed by larin @xcite and use the definition @xmath53 . since the @xmath54-tensor is intrinsically a four - dimensional object it can not be used in dimensional regularization and has to be taken out of the calculation until the renormalization has been performed . taking the @xmath54-tensors out of the calculation the tensor structure of the pseudo - scalar and axial - vector correlators",
    "can be cast into the form @xmath55}_{\\sigma ' ] } +    \\pi^{p}_2    q^{[\\mu}q_{[\\mu'}g^{\\nu}_{\\nu'}g^{\\rho}_{\\rho'}g^{\\sigma]}_{\\sigma ' ] }    \\ , \\\\    { \\pi^{a}}^{\\mu\\nu\\rho}_{\\mu'\\nu'\\rho ' } & = & \\pi^{a}_1     g^{[\\mu}_{[\\mu'}g^{\\nu}_{\\nu'}g^{\\rho]}_{\\rho ' ] } +    \\pi^{a}_2 q^{[\\mu}q_{[\\mu'}g^{\\nu}_{\\nu'}g^{\\rho]}_{\\rho ' ] }   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 $ ] denotes total antisymmetrization .",
    "after renormalization these expressions can be multiplied with the @xmath54-tensors to obtain the final result .",
    "the correlators are then given by @xmath57 the pseudo - scalar and the longitudinal part of the axial - vector correlator are connected through a ward identity .",
    "@xmath58 in order to retain this ward identity for the singlet contribution it is necessary to cancel the axial - vector anomaly . for this reason we computed the singlet part @xmath59 of the axial - vector correlator for an isospin doublet @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is taken to be heavy and @xmath62 light .",

    "for convenience we set the renormalization scale @xmath65 .",
    "since the longitudinal part of the axial - vector correlator can be easily obtained from the pseudo - scalar one by use of the ward identity ( [ eq:1 ] ) we give only the results for the transversal part in this case .",
