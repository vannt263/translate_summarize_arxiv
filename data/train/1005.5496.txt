    "the process of the energy interchange between radiation and matter provided by compton scattering is relevant in many areas of physics .",
    "for example , in cosmology it keeps the matter at the same temperature as radiation @xcite .",
    "compton scattering is also a unique spectroscopy for condensed matter physics , which has acquired greater importance with the advent of modern synchrotron sources @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been used to extract information about wave functions of valence electrons in a variety of systems ranging from ice @xcite and water @xcite to alloys @xcite and correlated electron systems @xcite . moreover",
    ", compton scattering can potentially help delineate confinements @xcite and spin polarization effects @xcite in nanoparticles .",
    "the compton scattering cross section strength is determined by the classical electron radius , also known as the thomson scattering length , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron charge , @xmath4 is the electron mass , @xmath5 is the speed of light and @xmath6 is the dielectric constant .",
    "unfortunately , the small size of @xmath7 makes compton experiments in condensed matter systems difficult .",
    "this is why only a few experiments have been done , even with the best synchrotron sources .",
    "the classical proton radius is even smaller by a factor of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the proton mass .",
    "therefore , nuclei are practically invisible in x - ray compton scattering experiments .    in 1952 ,",
    "max born suggested that the electronic radius @xmath7 is connected to an absolute length scale @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , if the electromagnetic interaction strength is modified , @xmath1 must change as well . understanding this variation",
    "could enable us to enhance the compton scattering cross sections by _ engineering _ an effective quantum electro - dynamics ( qed ) interaction .",
    "the effective coupling constant @xmath10 can be modified through the dielectric response @xmath6 , for instance , if the incident photon energy is tuned near to the binding energy of a deep core electron level in certain materials .",
    "this work shows that the compton cross section can depend strongly on the effective coupling constant @xmath0 and that a reduction of @xmath0 as small as @xmath11 may lead to an increase in the cross section by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the present results connect @xmath7 to a fundamental length @xmath1 and thus are consistent with the old hypothesis by born .        the triple - differential scattering cross section for the process shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] , which is the elementary step underlying compton scattering ,",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scattering angle , @xmath15 is the fourier transform of the occupied dyson orbital @xmath16 with binding energy @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the momentum transferred to the final system , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the energies of the photon before and after the collision . the ejected electron state is usually approximated by a plane wave with momentum @xmath21 and energy @xmath22 if @xmath23 . in this regime , compton scattering is a unique window on the electronic structure of matter because in contrast with most structural analysis techniques which can only deliver information on the total electron densities , this spectroscopy allows direct measurements in momentum space of the electron density associated with a single ionization channel ( i.e. a dyson orbital in a one - electron picture ) . in the low - energy limit ( i.e. @xmath24 ) , thirring @xcite has shown that the compton scattering cross section with all radiative corrections reduces in the non - relativistic expression given by eq .",
    "( [ eqcross ] ) .",
    "the only effect of the vacuum or the medium is to renormalize the thomson scattering length @xmath7 .",
    "the _ thirring theorem _ is a consequence of lorentz and gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "we now turn to a general thermodynamic argument in order to derive how the electron volume @xmath25 depends on the effective coupling constant @xmath0 . since the classical electron radius @xmath7 is the length at which qed renormalization effects become important , our argument must be consistent with differential equations of the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "thermodynamics is widely considered as a fundamental theory , since it has a universal applicability @xcite .",
    "indeed it does not need any modification due to either relativity or quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics gives the variation of internal energy @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the temperature , @xmath28 is the entropy and @xmath29 is a pressure imposed by a fictitious piston on the volume @xmath30 in order to set the units scale for a given @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy scale is characterized by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents a positive integer exponent to be determined .",
    "the negative sign of the pressure @xmath33 is explained by the fact that the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuation ( i.e. , the casimir effect ) tries to pull the piston back into the system .",
    "similar inward pressures are produced by cosmological constants @xcite .",
    "the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eqde ] ) is similar to a chemical potential term , since the number of virtual photons is proportional to the effective coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we are assuming that the electron mass @xmath4 determines the chemical potential of the virtual photons and that it is generated by the coulomb field of the electron .",
    "in adiabatic conditions , the term @xmath34 vanishes .",
    "moreover , at equilibrium , @xmath35 , thus the renormalization group @xmath36 function @xcite deduced from eq .",
    "( [ eqde ] ) is given by @xmath37 the solutions for @xmath38 show that the electron localizes ( i.e. , @xmath39 becomes small ) when the interaction strength increases .",
    "when @xmath40 , the radius scales as @xmath41 and has a maximal finite size @xmath42 corresponding at @xmath43 while for @xmath44 , the scaling is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is radius corresponding at @xmath47 .",
    "the exponent @xmath48 is consistent with the qed @xmath36 function @xcite .",
    "the born hypothesis is also verified when @xmath48 , since the corresponding solution admits a minimal length @xmath1 different from zero . in this case , the thomson scattering length depends on @xmath49 by an exponential function @xmath50 where @xmath1 is a certain small length to be determined .",
    "moreover , the corresponding pressure @xmath51 sets the atomic energy units .",
    "in fact , the atomic units are as natural as the fundamental planck units @xcite : their ratios to the fundamental units can be explained within our present argument connecting the thomson scattering length to the fundamental scale .",
    "interestingly , the volume renormalization factor @xmath52 is @xmath53 for @xmath48 .",
    "this term is similar to the boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics ( where @xmath0 plays the role of an effective temperature ) .     as a function of the inverse of the effective coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "both @xmath54 and @xmath0 are pure numbers ( units are dimensionless ) . ]    the cross section enhancement defined by @xmath55^{2/3}\\ ] ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the case @xmath48 : a reduction of @xmath0 by few percents induces a huge increase in @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , cross section enhancements obtained by tuning the incident photon energy near the binding energy of a deep core electron level can be described by the behavior for @xmath48 while the cases @xmath56 give negligible cross section enhancements for small variations of @xmath0 .",
    "the trend of @xmath54 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] can be produced by a change @xmath57 of the dielectric response near an absorption edge .",
    "standard inelastic x - ray scattering experiments without the measurement of the kinematics of the outgoing ( recoil ) electron contain many other processes in addition to the elementary scattering event of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . therefore , coincidence @xmath58 experiments @xcite are needed in order to separate the x - ray compton scattering with nearly free electrons from complicated processes .",
    "some @xmath58 spectrometers are already available for hard x - rays @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , standard @xmath58 experiments can be tremendously challenging .",
    "instead , one could use a soft - x - ray fluorescence spectrometer by carlisle _",
    "_ @xcite . by tuning the incident photon at the @xmath59 edge of graphite , enhancement effects of the total cross section have been already observed . a coincidence measurement detecting the electrons escaping from the sample",
    "can then be used to separate compton from other types of inelastic scattering . in this much simpler setup multiple scattering of the electrons in the sample",
    "are not an impediment to extracting the compton contribution .",
    "realistic dielectric data for graphite provided by draine @xcite illustrate how tuning the incident photon energy near the binding energy of the @xmath59 core level changes the dielectric response and thus the effective coupling constant for the valence electrons . when @xmath48 , a compton cross - section enhancement @xmath54 of almost a factor @xmath12 is predicted in graphite by using draine s dielectric data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "( ratio of the real part of the dielectric function @xmath6 and the vacuum permittivity @xmath60 ) near the @xmath59 edge of graphite .",
    "@xmath61 is the incident photon energy .",
    "the points are from draine @xcite .",
    "symbol size is representative of error bars .",
    "bottom : corresponding cross section enhancement @xmath54 . ]",
    "we note that a similar variation of the dielectric function for diamond has been previously reported by nithianandam and rife @xcite . besides , a calculation based on the finite difference method for near - edge structure ( fdmnes ) @xcite agrees with the dielectric data of draine .",
    "fdmnes shows that the anomalous scattering factor near the @xmath59 edge of graphite becomes greater in amplitude than the number of electrons , causing the real part of @xmath62 to be greater than unity ( @xmath60 is the vacuum permittivity ) .",
    "next , we justify a value for @xmath1 . according to veneziano @xcite , a consistent quantum gravitational theory should obey the born principle of reciprocity @xcite , a symmetry law under the interchange of space - time coordinates and the energy - momentum coordinates , which naturally leads to harmonic oscillators and to the normal modes of vibrating strings .",
    "in such theory it is natural to take as the action quantum the square of the planck length @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the planck constant and @xmath65 is the gravitational constant . indeed , by using eq .",
    "( [ eqr0 ] ) with the planck length @xmath1 and @xmath66 , the calculated thomson scattering length is @xmath67 , which differs about @xmath68 from its exact value .",
    "minor renormalization effects of the gravitational constant @xmath65 could improve the agreement @xcite .",
    "finally , we could also reverse the logic . in our treatment",
    "the length @xmath1 is not fixed _ a priori_. therefore",
    ", we can use data from x - rays experiments in graphite to get information about the size of @xmath1 .",
    "this would strongly vivify a big portion of the existing literature in quantum gravity for which the presence of an effective minimal length is assumed to describe the discretization of a quantum space - time .",
    "presently , in the absence of any experimental signature for quantum gravity , such a minimal length is generically set between the electroweak scale of @xmath69 cm and the planck length . as a result",
    "we are opening the door to the possibility of determining an extreme energy effect with sophisticated low energy experiments .",
    "in addition since preliminary data seem to support the idea that @xmath70 up to 1 @xmath71 , we can get more stringent constraints about the extension of the conjectured additional spatial dimensions with respect to what we currently know from the observed short scale deviations of newton s law @xcite .    in conclusion , we suggest that the low energy compton cross section for the valence ( i.e. , nearly free ) electrons of graphite can be described within the framework of the thirring theorem , implying that the only effect of the medium is to renormalize the thompson scattering length @xmath7 .",
    "besides , a general thermodynamic argument shows that the compton scattering cross section grows exponentially if the effective coupling constant @xmath0 decreases .",
    "in particular , a striking enhancement is predicted when the incident photon energy is tuned near the binding energy of the @xmath59 core level of graphite .",
    "the present enhancement effect is also consistent with the qed renormalization group .",
