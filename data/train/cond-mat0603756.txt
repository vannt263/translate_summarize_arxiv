    "polyelectrolytes ( pe s ) are polymer chains that carry ionizable groups along their backbones . upon solution in aqueous solvents ,",
    "these groups dissociate , leaving behind a charged chain and the corresponding counterions in the solution .",
    "chemically anchoring @xmath0 such pe - chains on a colloidal particle of radius @xmath1 gives rise to a spherical polyelectrolyte brush ( spb ) . in the limit in which the height @xmath2 of the brush greatly exceeds @xmath1 , one talks instead about polyelectrolyte stars . a great deal of theoretical@xcite and",
    "experimental@xcite effort has been devoted in the recent past with the goal of understanding the conformations and the interactions of spb s and pe - stars .",
    "the reasons are many - fold .",
    "the grafted pe - chains can provide an electrosteric barrier against flocculation of the colloidal particles on which the chains are grafted , rendering the systems very interesting from the point of view of colloidal stabilization .",
    "moreover , they can act as control agents for gelation , lubrication and flow behavior . from the point of view of fundamental research , pe - stars are a novel system of colloidal particles that combine aspects from two different parts of colloid science : polymer theory and the theory of charged suspensions . accordingly , the derivation of the effective interaction between pe - stars has led to their description as ultrasoft colloids and to theoretical predictions on their structural and phase behavior@xcite that have received already partial experimental confirmation.@xcite moreover , certain similarities in the structural and phase behavior of pe - stars and ionic microgels have been established , demonstrating the close relationship between the two systems.@xcite    by and large , the theoretical investigations involving pe - stars have been limited to the study of either single pe - stars or bulk solutions of the same . however , a new field of promising applications and intriguing physics is arising when pe - stars or spb s are mixed with hard colloids or brought in contact with planar walls .",
    "indeed , pe - stars can be used to model cell adhesion and are also efficient drug - delivery and protein - encapsulation and immobilization agents.@xcite on the other hand , hydrogels , which are physically similar to pe - stars , adsorbed on planar walls , form arrays of dynamically tunable , photoswitchable or bioresponsive microlenses.@xcite the encapsulation properties as well as the characteristics of the microlenses depend sensitively on the interactions between the pe - stars and the colloidal particles or the wall , respectively .",
    "therefore , there exists a need to undertake a systematic effort in trying to understand these interactions physically and make quantitative predictions about the ways to influence them externally . in this paper , we take a first step in this direction by considering a pe - star in the neighborhood of a planar , uncharged and purely repulsive wall .",
    "we analyze the mechanisms that give rise to an effective star - wall repulsion and identify the counterion entropy and the chain compression against the planar wall as the major factors contributing to this force .",
    "our findings are corroborated by comparisons with molecular dynamics simulation results for a wide range of parameters that structurally characterize the stars .",

    "we study a dilute , salt - free solution of pe - stars confined between two hard walls parallel to the @xmath3-@xmath4-plane at positions @xmath5 , resulting in an overall wall - to - wall separation @xmath6 .",
    "we assume a good solvent that is only implicitly taken into account via its relative dielectric permittivity @xmath7 , i.e. , we are dealing with an aqueous solution . to avoid the appearance of image charges,@xcite we assume the dielectric constants to be the same on both sides of the respective confining walls .",
    "it turns out , however , that this is not a severe assumption , because the effective charge of a pe - star is drastically reduced compared to its bare value , due to the strong absorption of neutralizing counterions.@xcite hence , the influence of image charges can be expected to be of minor importance .",
    "the pe - stars themselves consist of @xmath0 pe - chains , all attached to a common colloidal core of radius @xmath1 , whose size equals the monomer size and is therefore much smaller than the typical center - to - end length of the chains for all parameter combinations .",
    "the introduction of such a core particle is necessary to place the arms in the vicinity of the center , where the monomer density can take very high values .",
    "the theoretical approach pertains to the limit of vanishingly small core size . in order to remove effects arising from the small ( but finite ) value of the core in the simulation model and to provide a comparison with theory",

    "[ sec : comparison ] , we want to point out that significant deviations arise between the effective star - wall forces as obtained by our computer simulations and their theoretical counterparts @xmath134 calculated using the formalism presented in sec .",

    "now , we want to elucidate the physical mechanism leading to these deviations and derive simple expressions for additional contributions to both the total effective forces and potentials , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "therewith , we will conclude the development of our theoretical approach .",
    "the need to introduce these supplementary contributions is due to so far unconsidered conformational changes enforced by the presence of the confining wall . during the construction of the mean - field part of our theory , we neglected such changes by assuming density profiles of monomers and counterions which are undisturbed compared to the case of isolated stars in full 3d geometries .",
    "the influence of the wall became manifest in a truncation of the spheres representing star and associated counterion cloud , only .",
    "but in reality , for @xmath42 in the order of the typical length of an arm of the star , the star will undergo strong configurational variations to avoid the wall since the monomers are not able to interpenetrate it .",
    "thereby , due to the presence of neighboring arms , it can be energetically favorable for chains directing towards the wall to compress instead of bending away from the surface , although this compression leads to an extra cost in electrostatic energy .",
    "the latter obviously originates in a decrease of the ion - ion distances along the backbones of the chains .",
    "[ fig : arm - comp](a ) and [ fig : arm - comp](b ) depict the situation .",
    "once a critical value of the chain length is reached , a further shortening of the chains under consideration becomes disadvantageous .",
    "electrostatic repulsions and excluded volume interaction increase more and more strongly , the chains will preferably curve and start to relax in length , see fig .   [",
    "fig : arm - comp](c ) .",
    "the occurrence of such compression - decompression processes is proved by our simulation runs .    in what follows",
    ", we will use a simplified picture and model the affected arms as rigid , uniformly charged rods of common length @xmath138 and diameter @xmath11 for both the compressed and the bent regime . in the former case",
    ", we assume the rods to have orientations perpendicular to the wall surface . in the latter case",
    ", we will account for the bending only via the re - lengthening of the rods and their change in orientation with respect to the @xmath35-axis .",
    "[ fig : arm - comp](c ) visualizes this approximation , whereby the shaded straight chain represents the imaginary rod that replaces the bent arm within the framework of our modeling . the total charge of one such rod is just @xmath139 , leading to an @xmath138-dependent linear charge density , @xmath140 , given by @xmath141 .",
    "we consider then the self - energy of one rod , as a function of its respective length @xmath138 , to be made up of a purely repulsive contribution which is electrostatic in nature and arises due to like - charge repulsions , and a second harmonic term with an effective spring constant @xmath142 describing the binding of the chain monomers in a coarse - grained fashion .",
    "thus , we have:@xcite @xmath143 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : correction:1 ] ) , we then obtain the corresponding force @xmath144 that acts on the ends of the rod parallel to its direction ( a negative / positive sign of @xmath145 corresponds to a force that tends to compress / stretch the rod . ) the competition of a repulsive and an attractive part results in a finite equilibrium length @xmath146 of the rod , i.e. , @xmath147 vanishes for @xmath148 .",
    "clearly , @xmath146 is related to the above introduced spring constant @xmath142 by the following condition : @xmath149    now , let @xmath150 and @xmath151 determine the range of center - to - surface distances for which the above described processes take place .",

    "[ fig : f - correct ] shows a concluding comparison of the full effective potential @xmath75 and the same without the inclusion of the compression term @xmath166 .",
    "according to the plot , the theoretically predicted total potential is purely repulsive and ultra - soft . as we will see in sec .",

    "using standard md techniques , a straightforward measurement of ( effective ) interaction potentials is not possible .",
    "thereto , one would have to apply more sophisticated methods.@xcite but since the mean force acting on the center of a pe - star can be easily received from computer experiments,@xcite we will focus on a comparison of such effective forces and corresponding theoretical predictions . to be more precise",
    ": when choosing the colloidal center of a star at a fixed position @xmath167 as effective coordinate in our simulations , the effective force can be measured as the time average over all instantaneous forces @xmath168 acting on the core ( cf .  also the simulation model in  sec .",
    "[ sec : md ] ) by means of the expression : @xmath169    in all considerations to come , we will deal with absolute values of the forces only .",
    "it is obvious from the chosen geometry that the effective forces are in average directed perpendicular to the confining wall , i.e. , parallel to the @xmath35-axis .",
    "thus , the mean values of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-components vanish , leading to the relation @xmath170 . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "the effective forces and potentials depend on the @xmath35-component of @xmath167 alone , whereas @xmath171 .",
    "consequently , the forces are connected to the potential by the following simple equation : @xmath172 therewith , predictions for the effective forces can be computed starting from theoretical results for the corresponding potential ( see sec .  [",

    "this allows the desired comparison to md data .",

    ", we also refer to table [ table : radii ] , where the number of condensed counterions @xmath60 as obtained from our md runs is shown for different parameter combinations together with corresponding values for isolated pe - stars in unconfined geometries .",
    "[ fig : f - results ] is the core piece of this work and finally presents both our simulational and theoretical results for the effective star - wall forces .",
    "as can be seen from the plots , we find a very good agreement for all combinations of arm numbers and charging fractions .",
    "the theory lines exhibit a remarkable step - like shape for intermediate values of the center - to - surface distance @xmath42 arising due to the introduction of the chain compression term @xmath136 .",
    "the latter had to be added to the electrostatic - entropic forces @xmath134 to account for conformational changes induced by the spatial proximity of the star to the planar wall .",
    "in doing so , the functional form of the theoretically predicted forces accurately renders the results found by our computer experiments .",
    "when using the respective star s radius as basic length scale for the plots , the position of the step is independent of the parameters considered . in this sense",
    ", the effect is universal and there is no influence by specific details of the system .",
    "note that the distinct kink is an artifact resulting from the special construction of @xmath136 , it does not have any physical meaning .",
    "again , it should be emphasized that the described behavior is in contrast to the well - known star - star case.@xcite the difference between both systems mainly lies in the fact that a star is strictly forbidden to access the region of the wall , while it is allowed to interpenetrate another star - branched macromolecule to a certain degree . to put it in other words :",
    "a wall is impenetrable , while a second star is a diffuse , soft object . here , we also want to emphasize that the step is no hysterisis / metastability effect , as in our md simulations the center - to - surface separation @xmath42 is varied by pulling the stars away from the wall instead of pushing them towards it .",

    "[ fig : f - results ] are given in the corresponding legend boxes . obviously , @xmath60 significantly grows with both the charging fraction @xmath22 and the arm number @xmath0 , as is physically reasonable .",
    "table [ table : radii ] compares the fit values used to their counterparts obtained by our simulations .",
    "thereby , one recognizes systematic deviations , i.e. , the fit values are always slightly off from the numbers computed using the md method . both quantities",
    "are of the order of 50 - 60% of the total counterion number , for all functionalities @xmath0 and charging fractions @xmath22 .",
    "the discrepancies emerge due to the different meanings of the quantities star radius @xmath2 and number of condensed counterions @xmath60 . within the scope of the simplified theoretical model ,",
    "a pe - star is a spherical object of well - defined radius , while we observe permanent conformational fluctuations of the simulated stars .",
    "thus , the md radius does not identify a sharp boundary , but determines a typical length scale only . in this sense",
    ", the star can be viewed as a fluffy object .",
    "most of the time , there are monomers , monomer ions and condensed counterions located at positions outside the imaginary sphere of radius @xmath2 , and such counterions are not counted when measuring @xmath60 , thus the theory value typically exceeds the simulation one . with increasing arm number @xmath0 and charging fraction @xmath22 , there is less variation in length of different arms of a star , resulting in smaller deviations between the theoretically predicted @xmath60 and its md equivalent .",
    "table [ table : radii ] confirms this trend .",
    "a last remark pertains to the behavior for small center - to - surface distances @xmath42 .",
    "since our simulation model includes a colloidal core of finite radius @xmath1 , the forces obtained from md runs diverge for vanishing wall separations due to the core - wall lj repulsion which mimics the excluded volume interaction .",
    "in contrast , our theoretical model has no core , for this reason the predicted forces remain finite for the whole range of distances . according to this ,",
    "our theoretical approach is in principle not capable of reproducing a divergence of the forces , even in case of close proximity to the confining wall .",
    "we have measured by means of molecular dynamics simulations and analyzed theoretically the effective forces emerging when multiarm polyelectrolyte stars approach neutral , impenetrable walls .",
    "the forces have the typical range of the star radius , since osmotic pe - stars reabsorb the vast majority of the counterions and are thereby almost electroneutral ; longer - range forces that could arise due to the deformation of the diffuse counterion layer outside the corona radius are very weak , due to the small population of the free counterion species .",
    "the dominant mechanism that gives rise to the soft repulsion is the entropy of the absorbed counterions and the reduction of the space available to them due to the presence of the impenetrable wall . at the same time , a novel , additional mechanism is at work , which stems from the compression of a fraction of the star chains against the hard wall . for star - wall separations that are not too different from the equilibrium star radius ,",
    "the chain compression gives rise to an additional repulsive contribution to the force . at close star - wall approaches ,",
    "the compressed chains ` slip away ' to the side , orient themselves parallel to or away from the wall and thus the compression process ceases and the additional contribution to the force vanishes .",
    "the compression force could play a decisive role in influencing the cross - interaction between pe - stars and spherical , hard colloids of larger diameter .",
    "indeed , for this case , the cross - interaction could be calculated by using the results of the present work as a starting point and performing a derjaguin approximation",
