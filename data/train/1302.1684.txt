    "a tournament is an orientation of a complete graph .",

    "already in the 1960 s a whole monograph  @xcite was dedicated to this subject .",
    "many theorems have been proved about tournaments over the years . here",
    "we take a geometric perspective of the subject and view a tournament as an orientation of the one - dimensional skeleton of a simplex . as it turns out , higher - dimensional analogs where we orient the higher skeletons of the simplex are rich in structure and raise many intriguing problems . to make the distinction clear , we often refer henceforth to traditional tournaments as @xmath4-tournaments and to their @xmath0-dimensional counterparts as @xmath0-tournaments .    as far as we know , the first paper on higher dimensional tournaments is due to leader and tan  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known and easy to prove that in a @xmath4-tournament at most one quarter of the triples are cyclic , and they investigate higher - dimensional analogs of this statement .",
    "we start with some definitions and background material . unless otherwise stated , every tournament that we consider has vertex set @xmath5=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] with the natural order . maintaining the topological terminology",
    ", we refer to a subset @xmath6 as a _ face _ of _ dimension _ @xmath7 .",
    "a face of dimension @xmath0 is called a @xmath0-face for short , or even just a face when the relevant dimension is clear from the context .",
    "a @xmath0-tournament @xmath8 on vertex set @xmath9 is specified by a mapping @xmath10 . for a @xmath0-face @xmath11",
    "we call @xmath12 the _ orientation _ of @xmath13",
    ". we mostly write @xmath14 rather than @xmath12 .    for faces @xmath15 of dimension @xmath16 , respectively ,",
    "define @xmath17 as the orientation _ induced _ on @xmath18 by the positive orientation of @xmath13 ( viewed as a @xmath0-dimensional simplex ) .",
    "namely , let @xmath19 , @xmath20 , then @xmath21 .",

    "we often do not distinguish between a face and the corresponding ( column ) vector of the incidence matrix .",

    "the proof(s ) involve both analytic and geometric ideas .",
    "in particular , it is easy to tell from the degree vector of a @xmath4-tournament whether or not the tournament is acyclic .",

    "we call @xmath25 _ collapsible _ if it is possible to arrive at @xmath65 in a series of elementary collapses . note , e.g. , that the @xmath34-tournament of example [ ex1 ] has no free faces and is , therefore , not collapsible .",

    "it is easy to see that a collapsible tournament must be acyclic .",
    "no subface of a face that participates in a cycle can be free .",
    "this remains so even following any sequence of elementary collapses .",
    "let us recall the following well - known fact about @xmath4-tournaments @xcite :    every @xmath4-tournament on @xmath1 vertices has an acyclic subtournament on @xmath69 vertices .",

    "this , in particular , holds for random @xmath4-tournaments .    in section  [",

    "we show that every @xmath1-vertex @xmath0-tournament has an acyclic subtournament on @xmath71 vertices and the bound is tight .",
    "there are several simple conditions on @xmath4-tournaments which are all equivalent to `` transitivity '' .",

    "as we observe below , there is a natural bijection between @xmath1-vertex acyclic @xmath0-tournaments and the chambers of a certain arrangement in @xmath81 .",

    "@xmath90    before we prove inequality  ( [ recursion ] ) , we use it to derive the lower bound in theorem  [ thm1 ] . for @xmath3",

    "[ d-0/1]@xmath207[d - acyclic ]    start with the standard @xmath214-point triangulation of the projective plane in figure  [ fig:2 ] , where each of the @xmath215 faces is oriented clockwise . now add the face @xmath216 with the orientation @xmath217 i.e. , @xmath218 . note that the sum of the @xmath215 faces @xmath219 is zero .",
    "hence this partial tournament is already cyclic , but contains no cycle in @xmath201 coefficients .",
    "we could try and orient the remaining @xmath220 faces so as to maintain the property that there is no cycle in @xmath201 coefficients , but this plan must fail . consider the face @xmath221 and note that both @xmath222 are expressible as @xmath201 combinations of already oriented faces , namely @xmath223 @xmath224 consequently , however we orient @xmath225 , a @xmath201-cycle is created .",
    "as it turns out , this plan does work if we slightly modify the above construction .",
    "start instead from the @xmath215 point triangulation in figure  [ fig:2 ] along with the face @xmath216 .",
    "again the @xmath226 faces in this triangulation are oriented clockwise and @xmath217 .",
    "consequently ,    * this partial tournament has a single cycle , _ not _ in @xmath201 coefficients . *",
    "no additional cycle can be created by the addition of any single oriented face .",
    "it follows that we can orient the remaining faces one by one so as to preserve the first property .",
    "let @xmath225 be a face which was nt oriented yet .",
    "suppose that both orientations of @xmath225 are creating new cycles .",
    "namely , @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "then @xmath229 is another cycle , which does nt involve @xmath225 .",
    "hence , this must be ( a positive constant times ) the only existing cycle .",
    "this means that the two new cycles created by @xmath230 are using only the original faces and @xmath225 , contrary to the above second property .",
    "point triangulation of the real projective plane , and a modified @xmath215 point triangulation.,width=491,height=226 ]    [ d - acyclic]@xmath207[d - collapse ]    using a computer search , we found a point @xmath231 which does nt satisfy any of the equations @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "as explained above , such a point belongs to a unique chamber which corresponds to an acyclic @xmath220-vertex @xmath34-tournament .",
    "the resulting tournament is checked by the computer not to be collapsible .",
    "the point we found is @xmath234 @xmath235 ( coordinates are indexed by unordered pairs and appear in lexicographic order ) .",
    "better still , consider the following point in @xmath236 .",
    "@xmath237 @xmath238 this example is easier to verify , since the acyclic @xmath215-vertex @xmath34-tournament corresponding to @xmath40 has no free faces .",
    "[ d - collapse]@xmath207[d - realization ]    we describe a collapsible @xmath239-vertex @xmath34-tournament which is not realizable in the plane .",
    "we note first that there are precisely six isomorphism types of acyclic @xmath239-vertex @xmath34-tournaments , three of which are realizable in the plane .",
    "all other three are collapsible .",
    "we prove this for a specific tournament : let vertices @xmath240 be any triangle in the plane , with @xmath241 being mapped to the same point in the interior of the triangle ( think of @xmath239 as residing above @xmath242 ) .",
    "all faces , except for the three faces containing the edge @xmath243 are orientated clockwise .",
    "these three faces are oriented consistently with the orientation @xmath244 of the edge @xmath243 .",
    "the resulting @xmath34-tournament is collapsible , since all the edges @xmath245 are free , and each face contains one of these edges .    to see that this tournament is not realizable in the plane , note that its set of free edges form a disconnected graph , whereas in a realizable @xmath0-tournament the free @xmath42-faces form a ( topological ) cycle .",
    "although we are mostly concerned here with acyclic @xmath0-tournaments , we find the other notions interesting as well .",
    "below we make some comments about them , with a special interest in the relevant enumeration problems .",
    "leader and tan s notion of a @xmath0-dimensional cycle @xcite ( which they call  a directed simplex \" ) coincides with our @xmath185-cycle . in section [ sec_ramsey ]",
    "we make several observations concerning @xmath185-cycle - free @xmath0-tournaments .",
    "as mentioned , it is a classical fact that the largest acyclic subtournament of a random @xmath4-tournament has logarithmic order . corollary  [ no_cycle ] gives a @xmath0-dimensional analog of this statement , which is even stronger , since ",
    "acyclic \" is replaced by  contains no @xmath185-cycle \" .",
    "we give here upper bounds on the number of acyclic tournaments under the various interpretations of acyclicity , but we still do not know how many @xmath1-vertex @xmath185-cycle - free @xmath0-tournaments there are .",
    "the proof of lemma  [ no_d+2_cycle ] gives the upper bound @xmath246 which far exceeds the other upper bounds proved here on the number of  acyclic \" tournaments . whether or not this gap is inevitable we do not know .",
    "theorem  [ easy_ub ] is initially presented as an easy way to derive an upper bound on the number of acyclic tournaments .",
    "however its proof and specifically lemma  [ lem : deg_seq ] show the equivalence of the following two classes of @xmath0-tournaments : ( i ) those that contain no cycle in @xmath201 coefficients , and ( ii ) those that are uniquely reconstructible from their degree sequence .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ easy_ub ] gives an upper bound on the number of @xmath0-tournaments with no @xmath201-cycles .",
    "the lower bound in theorem  [ thm1 ] actually applies to the smaller class of collapsible @xmath0-tournaments . to see this , note that inequality ( [ recursion ] )",
    "can be proved likewise if `` acyclic '' is replaced by `` collapsible '' .",
    "it is interesting to get better upper and lower bounds on the number of collapsible @xmath1-vertex @xmath0-tournaments . in particular",
    ", better lower bounds will improve the lower bound in theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "an @xmath205-realizable @xmath0-tournaments is synonimous with an @xmath1-point _ order type _ in @xmath205 .",
    "order types are of much interest in discrete geometry ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "their number is known to be @xmath247  @xcite .",
    "we feel compelled to recall the following well - known conjecture    for every graph @xmath248 there is a @xmath249 such that every @xmath1-vertex graph which contains no induced copy of @xmath248 must have either a clique or an anticlique of cardinality @xmath250 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite this conjecture can be restated as follows :    for every @xmath4-tournament @xmath62 there is a @xmath249 such that every @xmath1-vertex @xmath4-tournament which contains no copy of @xmath62 has an acyclic subtournament on @xmath250 vertices .",
    "it would be interesting to consider high - dimensional analogs of these statements .",
    "in section  [ sub : arr ] we study a hyperplane arrangement in @xmath251 whose cells are in @xmath252 correspondence with the acyclic @xmath1-vertex @xmath0-tournaments .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the analogous arrangements in @xmath253 and in particular ask about the fundamental group of these complex arrangements .",
    "the situation for @xmath4-tournaments is well understood .",
    "namely , for @xmath254 let @xmath255 be the hyperplane defined by the equation @xmath256 .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath257 is the so - called pure braid group , a mathematical object of great importance and interest .",
    "it is an intriguing possibility that there are interesting groups waiting to be discovered for larger @xmath0 .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to determine the fundamental group @xmath258 , where for @xmath259 we define @xmath260 as the hyperplane in @xmath261 whose equation is @xmath262 .",
