    "the discontinuity disappears when the theory is extended at the non - linear level and then the vainshtein ( screening mechanism ) operates . in its original version",
    ", the mechanism works due to the appearance of a sixth degree of freedom , namely , the boulware - deser ghost @xcite , which is able to cancel exactly the effects of the scalar component at scales shorter than the vainshtein radius ( @xmath0 ) @xcite . in the new version of massive gravity",
    ", the mechanism appears through the non - linearities of the theory @xcite .",
    "the connection between vainshtein mechanism and the hawking radiation inside massive gravity has been analyzed in @xcite . regarding the vacuum solutions in massive gravity , they contain a natural degeneracy , difficult to explain inside the standard framework of gr @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy provides a natural loss of predictability of the theory .",
    "a possible solution to this problem has been done by the author in @xcite .",
    "the vacuum degeneracy is related to the preferred time - direction of the theory defined by the stckelberg function ( @xmath1 ) . in this sense , the gauge symmetry of the theory is spontaneously broken at the vacuum level . then the observers taking their time in different directions ( different frames of reference ) , define a set of vacuums , related to each other through rotations around the complex plane for the time coordinate . if the vacuum is shifted in order to get the physical one , then it is possible to explain the dynamical origin of the graviton mass as a vainshtein mechanism in time - domains .",
    "it can be concluded that there is a special class of observers defining the time in agreement with the stckelberg field function ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the observers defining a boost in agreement with the notion of time @xmath1 , will not perceive the effects of the dynamical graviton mass at all .",
    "@xmath1 contains the information of the extra - degrees of freedom of the theory and it has a trivial component which can be gauged away and a non - trivial one which contains the scales of the theory and the relevant information related to the extra - degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamical origin of the graviton mass ( higgs mechanism ) , comes from the relation between the observers defining the time in agreement with @xmath1 and the observers defining the time in a different direction ( different frame of reference or boost ) .",
    "the changes of the function @xmath1 under gauge transformations can be found if we consider as a local symmetry the set of diffeomorphism transformation of the action .",
    "in such a case , any generator related to the time - coordinate is a broken one . by the date ,",

    "in addition , some attempts for understanding the symmetry breaking pattern in massive gravity and the symmetry breaking mechanism from the perspective of the space - time have been done recently @xcite .",
    "the role of the symmetry breaking mechanism in the scenario of the effective theory of inflation , has been considered in @xcite . however , since the vainshtein mechanism is the responsible for the recovery of gr at scales below @xmath0 , and as a consequence , it is the mechanism able to recover the continuity between massive gravitons and massless ones ; then it is natural to suspect that the understanding of the higgs mechanism in massive gravity is related to a reformulation of the vainshtein mechanism in this theory .",
    "one important step toward this direction has been done by the author in @xcite , where the mechanism was expressed in terms of stckelberg functions ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this provides the chance of understanding the dynamical origin of the graviton mass if the vainshtein mechanism is analyzed over the time domains and not in the usual spatial domains .",
    "the scale at which the symmetry is broken , is clearly determined by the vainshtein scale , which is contained inside the non - trivial part of the function @xmath1 .",
    "for the family of solutions with one free - parameter and the stckelberg function arbitrary , the relation between the free - parameter of the potential ( massive action ) and the total derivative of @xmath1 , determines whether the vacuum is degenerate or not .",
    "this is analogous to the simplest case analyzed for the scalar field for the nambu - goldstone theorem . here in the formulation of higgs mechanism",
    ", there is a fraction of the christoffel connection which plays the role of the gauge field since it contains terms depending explicitly on the stckelberg function at the perturbative level .",
    "the other fraction , corresponds to the usual gr contribution .",
    "then in a free - falling frame , the non - trivial contribution for the christoffel connection and related to the stckelberg function , does not vanish , contrary to the case of the gr contribution .",
    "in fact , in a free - falling frame of reference , expanding the dynamical metric as a function of the stckelberg function at the perturbative level , it is not conformal to minkowski , except when the stckelberg function is spatially and time - independent",

    "gravity enters perturbatively through a dimensionless parameter @xmath2 , which depends on the fundamental scales of the theory and on the distance of the observer with respect to the source .",
    "the vacuum degeneracy for this case is equivalent to a multiplicity of fundamental scales of the theory . finally , in sec .",
    "( [ conc ] ) , i conclude .",
    "the coming analysis in this manuscript , is expected to be more general than the theory of massive gravity . however , for study purposes , i formulate the problem inside the drgt theory of massive gravity , which is well known inside the community .",
    "the action in the drgt non - linear massive gravity formulation is defined as @xcite :    @xmath3    this action contains three free - parameter , namely , the graviton mass , and the two parameters appearing inside the potential @xmath4 :    @xmath5    where :    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    we can then compute the field equations as follows :    @xmath13    where :    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the fiducial metric and @xmath16 is the trace of the matrix @xmath17 .",

    "these set of parameters are related to the previously defined @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite . under this previous condition",
    ", the stckelberg function @xmath1 becomes arbitrary .",
    "this is not a coincidence because the theory has three parameters .",
    "if we fix one of the parameters with the background , then the other two parameters remain free .",
    "there exists a non - trivial connection between the mass parameter and the stckelberg function which is the key point for the higgs mechanism formulation . later in this manuscript",
    "i will explain this connection .",
    "there is a second family of solutions .",
    "they correspond to the case with two - free parameters satisfying the condition @xmath24 with the stckelberg function @xmath1 constrained to some specific dependence on the space - time .",
    "the constraint has the finkelstein - type form if we impose the regularity condition for the future event horizon . in this case , again there are two - free parameters after constraining one . any solution satisfying the spherically symmetric condition ,",
    "is expressed generically as :    @xmath25    where :    @xmath26    with @xmath27 .",
    "this previous solution looks similar to the schwarzschild - like one after coordinate transformations .",
    "however , here we have to take into account that @xmath1 is not in reality a coordinate ( gauge ) transformation function , but rather a stckelberg function containing the information of the extra - degrees of freedom of the theory .",

    "( [ eq : drgt metric ] ) are obtained after using the non - linear version of the stckelberg trick expressed as :    @xmath28    with the components of the stckelberg function given by :    @xmath29    in eq .",

    "the vainshtein radius defines three regimes , given by :    @xmath36    the original formulation of the vainshtein mechanism in terms of stckelberg functions was developed in @xcite .",
    "the so - dubbed vainshtein conditions were derived originally by the author and they are defined in the previous section .",
    "they correspond to extremal conditions of the dynamical metric in unitary gauge .",

    "the extremal condition applied to the potential defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b2 ] ) , implies :    @xmath37    the details of the potential expansion are not relevant at all .",
    "what is important is that @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of matrices of the form @xmath38 . for the cases with all the gravitational degrees of freedom inside the dynamical metric ,",
    "then eq . ( [ eq : ptm ] ) becomes :    @xmath39    and this is just equivalent to :    @xmath40    this previous condition has to be applied to all the components of the dynamical metric in unitary gauge .",
    "if we want to calculate the vainshtein radius , all what we have to do is to translate all the degrees of freedom ( in any coordinate system ) inside the dynamical metric and then after we can apply the conditions ( [ eq : this one ] ) , after which we can solve the equation for the scale @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the conditions ( [ eq : this one ] ) , are the ones necessary for expressing the vainshtein mechanism in terms of stckelberg functions .",

    "i will summarize the results due to the nambu - goldstone theorem .",
    "we have seen in the previous explanations that the sigma model provides a basic example of the theorem . in this example , the symmetry @xmath45 is broken and then the symmetry @xmath61 remains after selecting some vacuum . here",
    "i will explain how the sigma model is a consequence of a more general theorem , namely , the nambu - goldstone theorem .",
    "note that in general , the potential @xmath62 , can be expanded as :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 , since we are expanding around an extremal point .",
    "the mass matrix is symmetric and given by the coefficient :    @xmath65    this previous condition is due to the fact that @xmath66 represents a minimum . at this point",
    "i will assume that the full action given by :    @xmath67    is invariant under the the action of the group @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the selected vacuum state is invariant under the action of a subgroup of @xmath69 , given by @xmath70 .",
    "the vacuum state is not invariant under the action of the full group @xmath69 . in resume :    @xmath71    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote the representations of the groups @xmath69 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "however , the potential @xmath76 is still invariant under the action of the full group @xmath69 .",
    "the action of this group on the potential expansion ( [ eq : invariant ] ) gives the result :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the generator of the group transformation . in the @xmath73 representation for example",
    ", it would take the form :    @xmath79    where @xmath78 denotes the action of the operator @xmath80 on the function state @xmath81 . if we introduce the result ( [ eq : globalsymmetry ] ) inside the expansion ( [ eq : invariant ] ) , then we get the condition :    @xmath82    note that if @xmath83 , namely , when the vacuum state selected is invariant under the action of the the group , then the corresponding mass component @xmath84 is not necessarily zero . on the other hand , when the symmetry generator is broken , namely , when the group element belonging to @xmath69 does not leave the vacuum invariant , then @xmath85 and then the mass components related to this condition are necessarily zero ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "then the number of broken generators are clearly related to to the existence of the nambu - goldstone bosons . in resume ,",
    "the number of fields whose mass is not required to be zero , is determined by the dimension of the subgroup @xmath75 under which the vacuum is invariant . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of nambu - goldstone bosons ( massless particles ) is determined by the dimension of the coset @xmath87 .",
    "the results of this section were taken from @xcite .",
    "in quantum theory , the goldstone theorem suggests that if there is a field operator @xmath88 with non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath89 and in addition , the vacuum expectation value is not a singlet under the transformations of some representation of a symmetry group , then some massless particles will appear in the spectrum states .",
    "it is well known that up to a total derivative term in the action ( lagrangian @xmath90 ) , the conserved charge is given by :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 corresponds to the field variations under symmetry transformations of the lagrangian .",
    "the previously defined current is divergence - less and the corresponding charges are given by :    @xmath93    in the standard cases , these charges are conserved , @xmath94 , and they have a well defined commutation relations given by :    @xmath95=c^{abc}q^c,\\ ] ]    where @xmath96 are the structure constants of the lie algebra .",
    "we can define an unitary operator with the charge being the generator of the group transformations :    @xmath97    if the vacuum is non - degenerate , then the previously defined charge annihilates the vacuum , namely , @xmath98 , or equivalently :    @xmath99    when the vacuum is degenerate , then these previous conditions are not satisfied and in general :    @xmath100    this case is the interesting one for the purposes of this manuscript .",
    "it is not difficult to observe that in drgt massive gravity , for the black - hole solutions , the mass of the black - hole will play the role of the charge . in fact , the apparent non - conservation of the komar and adm mass in the non - liner theory of massive gravity , is a consequence of the fact that the vacuum is degenerate after the vainshtein radius @xcite .",
    "the apparent non - conservation is provoked by the presence of the extra - degrees of freedom appearing after the vainshtein scale .",
    "their presence , creates a distortion of the notions of time perceived by observers located at scales larger than the vainshtein one .",
    "the distortions of time , specifically in its periodicity in the complex plane after analytical extension is what generates the effect of extra - particle creation process for a black - hole inside this theory @xcite .",
    "as has been explained before , this extra - component of radiation comes from the mismatch between the periodicity of the function @xmath1 and the standard time - coordinates @xmath101 .",
    "these previous effects are all consequence of the direction deviations between the killing vector in the direction @xmath1 with respect to the one defined in the direction of @xmath101 . at this point we can recognize a connection between the standard nambu - goldstone theorem with the related higgs mechanism when the symmetries involved are local ; and the mechanisms responsible for the particle creation process of black - holes , namely , mechanisms related to the conformal symmetry .",
    "this manuscript can also be perceived as a connection between the higgs mechanism and the particle creation process of black - holes when we consider gauge symmetries .",
    "returning to the main topic of this section , if the operator @xmath88 is not a singlet , then its commutation with the charge @xmath102 is non - zero and given by :    @xmath103=\\phi(x).\\ ] ]    the vacuum expectation value of this operator is given by :    @xmath104    if we introduce the definition of charge given in eq .",

    "note that @xmath107 and the spatial integrals were evaluated .",
    "the current conservation guarantees that the previous expression is independent of @xmath108 .",
    "then it is trivial to observe that @xmath109 and this proves the goldstone theorem . the proof elaborated in the previous way can be found in @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we observed that the goldstone theorem is a consequence of group theory and the exact form of the potential is not important at the moment of understanding how many nambu - goldstone bosons appear after breaking the symmetry .",
    "notice that in the previous section in order to get the goldstone theorem result , it was enough to consider global symmetries for the lagrangian . in this section , i will explain the higgs mechanism .",
    "the higgs mechanism appears when we consider local gauge symmetries .",
    "consider for example the lagrangian :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the corresponding covariant derivative , which transforms like the field @xmath81 under local gauge transformations .",
    "the potential for the previous lagrangian is given by :    @xmath112    the action is invariant under the following transformations :    @xmath113    the ground state is given by :    @xmath114    note that @xmath115 can not be interpreted at this point as the mass but rather as a parameter .",
    "in fact , @xmath116 is necessary in this case .",
    "since the vacuum breaks the symmetry , this means that we are working around the wrong vacuum , then we can redefine it by using the following shift :    @xmath117    in terms of this field redefinition , the lagrangian ( [ eq : mylag ] ) becomes :    @xmath118    note that there is a mix between the kinetic term of the field @xmath119 and the massless vector field @xmath120 .",
    "then we can eliminate the @xmath119 field by doing the following transformations :    @xmath121    after introducing these set of transformations , we get :    @xmath122    we can observe that this lagrangian has two fields , namely , one vector field @xmath120 which is massive and a second scalar field @xmath123 , which is massless for a total of four degrees of freedom .",
    "the degrees of freedom ( one ) represented by the field @xmath119 has been eaten up by the vector field .",
    "then the nambu - goldstone bosons produced after symmetry breaking , can be eaten up by other fields and then such fields become massive .",
    "the gauge represented by the lagrangian ( [ eq : reallag ] ) is called unitary gauge because it represents the gauge where physical particles will appear .",
    "the higgs mechanism as explained in this section , is taken from @xcite .",
    "here i will analyze the theory around a `` free - falling '' frame satisfying the condition @xmath124 locally for any observer .",
    "the dynamical metric in this case is not necessarily minkowski inside the massive gravity formulation if the stckelberg function is expanded on it at the perturbative level . under stationary solutions , only when the spatial derivative of the stckelberg function vanishes , the free - falling metric is conformal to minkowski .",

    "this is consistent with what has been already found in @xcite . on the other hand , for any value taken by the parameter @xmath131 , at the background level",
    ", the massive action will behave as a cosmological constant term .",
    "different case is expected at the perturbative level , where the massive action will have a non - trivial behavior ( to be analyzed later ) .",

    ", there is no preferred time orientation and the physics will be independent on the frame of reference selected by the observer .",
    "this is equivalent to a local vainshtein mechanism and is independent of the position of the observers with respect to the source . in other words ,",

    "for the case with two free - parameters with the stckelberg function constrained to behave as a finkelstein - type coordinate in order to guarantee regularity , the analysis at the background level revealed that the massive action is just a cosmological constant term . at the perturbative level however , we expect a fierz - pauli behavior or something similar . what is interesting is the fact that the graviton mass is fixed at this level ( with the two free - parameters of the potential arbitrary ) . for the second case , namely , with one free - parameter and the stckelberg function arbitrary , the behavior is not trivial but",

    "in this manuscript i have done a possible consistent formulation of the higgs mechanism at the graviton level based on the vainshtein mechanism in time - domains .",
    "this means that the vacuum has a preferred time direction and then it becomes degenerate .",

    "the number of independent broken generators are related to the nambu - goldstone bosons of the theory . however at this point it is not clear how many broken generators are related to the number of nambu - godstone bosons .",
    "initially for a clean analysis , i have worked in a free - falling frame , which from the gr point of view would correspond to a flat spacetime ( minkowski ) . in massive gravity , only when the spatial dependence of the stckelberg function vanishes , the dynamical metric in unitary gauge is conformal to minkowski . for a non - vanishing @xmath133 , the conformal triviality in a free - falling frame",
    "is lost in some scenarios .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for the case of two free - parameters with the stckelberg function demanding regularity on the future event - horizon , the free - falling condition guarantees that @xmath126 .",
    "however , when we have one free - parameter with the stckelberg function arbitrary , there is no connection between the free - falling condition and the vanishing derivative of the stckelberg function .",
    "then the equivalence principle is broken for this particular family of solutions if we include all the degrees of freedom inside the dynamical metric .",
    "this case is the interesting one for the purposes of this manuscript and the key ingredient for the formulation of the higgs mechanism at the graviton level .",
    "the non - vanishing term @xmath133 has a double role in the higgs mechanism .",
    "the first one is that it appears in the definition of the false ( physical ) vacuum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : acalanojo234mamamia ] ) .",
    "the second role is that it appears inside the christoffel connection terms of the action , which otherwise would vanish in a free - falling frame of reference .",
    "the christoffel connections , then play the role of gauge fields generating the graviton mass dynamically . note that in this manuscript initially i considered the condition @xmath226 , and then i extended the results to the situations where this condition is not satisfied .",
    "if we consider the background to be stationary , then any deviation from this condition will enter at the perturbative level .",
    "finally , in this paper i introduced the gravitational effects for the cases where the free - falling condition is not satisfied .",
    "i introduced the gravitational effects through the parameter @xmath2 , which contains the gravitational scales of the theory .",
    "this parameter appears inside the function @xmath245 .",
    "the vacuum will be then degenerate due to the presence of the functions @xmath240 ( non - trivial time - dependence of @xmath1 ) and @xmath259 in the solutions .",
    "this is not new with respect to the other cases , however , what is interesting in this situation is that this degeneracy is equivalent to a multiplicity of the fundamental scales of the theory .",
    "this issue can be connected with a renormalization flow and the notions of observers in this theory .",
    "an observer defining the time in agreement with @xmath1 , will define @xmath260 .",
    "for this observer , the gravitational effects disappear .",
    "all the other observers defining the time arbitrarily , will perceive the gravitational effects at the perturbative level through the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this multiplicity of the fundamental scales of the theory will be related each other through the set of diffeomorphism transformations depending on the stckelberg functions ( related to the time - direction ) . in other words , they are connected through the broken generators , which are related to the coset space . for the special case where we only consider the scalar stckelberg function , the multiplicity of the fundamental scales of the theory will be connected each other through a transformations of the type @xmath201 in the complex plane .",
