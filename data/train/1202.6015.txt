    "for long wavelengths , the propagation of sound waves in a moving fluid is analogous to that of light in a curved metric  @xcite . however , hawking radiation issues from very short wavelength modes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , dispersion effects must be taken into account when computing the spectrum emitted by an acoustic black hole . when the dispersive scale @xmath0 ( the healing length in a bose condensate ) is much smaller than the surface gravity scale @xmath1 , which fixes the hawking temperature @xmath2 ( in units where @xmath3 ) ,",
    "it is now well - understood that the spectrum is robust  @xcite .",
    "however , the precise extension of this regime , and the spectral properties outside it , are still poorly understood .",
    "the aim of this paper is to remedy this situation .",
    "doing so , we shall complete ref .",
    "@xcite where we studied flow profiles with a local perturbation which strongly varies close to the horizon .",
    "up to a certain high frequency introduced by dispersion , it was observed that the spectrum remains accurately planckian even when the temperature significantly differs from the standard one .",
    "hence , below that frequency , the whole spectrum is accurately characterized by the low - frequency effective temperature .",
    "analyzing this temperature , two regimes were found : as long as the perturbation scale is larger than a certain critical length , the temperature remains very close to the standard one fixed by @xmath4 . for variations on shorter distances instead",
    ", the temperature is given by a spatial average over that critical length .",
    "interestingly , the latter is not simply given by the dispersive length @xmath0 .",
    "rather , it scales as @xmath5 for quartic dispersion .    to complete that analysis",
    ", we determine the low - frequency temperature in simpler flows characterized by fewer parameters .",
    "we observe two well - defined regimes .",
    "first , when the flow is smooth and dispersion negligible , the spectrum slightly differs from the relativistic one .",
    "second , there is an opposite regime which is well - described by using steplike profiles to characterize the near - horizon metric  @xcite . with numerical techniques",
    "@xcite , we investigate the intermediate situations and show that there are no other regimes than these two , in agreement with ref .  @xcite .",
    "we also show that the transition from one regime to the other is governed by a single parameter which scales in the same way as the above - mentioned critical distance .",
    "interestingly , this parameter also fixes the ( finite ) redshift undergone by dispersive modes when scattered on a sonic horizon .",
    "for definiteness , we consider the phonon spectra in the context of atomic bose condensates . yet",
    ", our analysis applies to other superluminal dispersion relations , as well as subluminal ones , in virtue of the correspondence  @xcite between the various types of dispersion relations .",
    "it can therefore be used to explore the consequences on black hole thermodynamics  @xcite which arise from violations of lorentz invariance found in certain theories of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the relevant parameters which govern the mode scattering on a sonic horizon .",
    "we then compute the low - frequency limit of the emitted fluxes in steplike flow profiles .",
    "finally , by numerically scanning a wide parameter space , we characterize the validity domains of both the hawking and the steplike regimes . in the appendices , we present the basic concepts governing phonon fluxes , as well as the tools needed to compute these fluxes in steplike flows .",
    "we also show that our main results remain unchanged when considering a larger class of flows .",
    "we consider elongated condensates stationary flowing along the longitudinal direction @xmath8 , and we assume that the transverse dimensions are small enough that phonon excitations are longitudinal . in the hydrodynamic regime ,",
    "phonon propagation is governed by the dalembert equation in the metric  @xcite @xmath9 where the flow velocity @xmath10 and the speed of sound @xmath11 only depend on @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the condensate flows from right to left ( @xmath12 ) and that the sonic horizon ( where @xmath13 crosses @xmath14 ) is located at @xmath15 .",
    "when the gradient @xmath16 is positive , one obtains an analogue black hole horizon .",
    "indeed , in the near - horizon region ( nhr ) where @xmath17 is a good approximation , the null outgoing ( upstream ) geodesics are @xmath18 .",
    "correspondingly , the wave vectors obey  @xcite @xmath19 these equations are the signatures of a ( killing ) horizon . notice that this exponential decay law is also found in an inflationary de  sitter space where the hubble parameter @xmath20 plays the role of @xmath21 . in that case",
    ", the number of @xmath6-folds @xmath22 is used to quantify the duration of the inflationary period .",
    "the origin of this instructive correspondence is simple : when @xmath23 , the de  sitter metric in lematre coordinates reads @xmath24 . to leading order in @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , it coincides with the metric of eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) evaluated in the nhr when imposing that @xmath27 , the speed of sound at the horizon , is 1 . for more details , see sec .  3.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    when ignoring high - frequency dispersion , eq",
    ".   implies that @xmath28 , the spectrum of upstream phonons spontaneously emitted from the horizon , is planckian with hawking temperature @xmath29 , in units where @xmath30 .",
    "when introducing dispersion for frequencies above @xmath31 , the characteristics of the wave equation no longer follow null geodesics close to the horizon  @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , eq .   still applies in the nhr , and this is the root of the robustness of the spectrum  @xcite . to characterize the properties of @xmath28",
    ", we define the temperature function @xmath32 by @xmath33 as such , @xmath32 is simply another way to express @xmath28 .",
    "it is particularly useful because it was observed  @xcite that @xmath28 stays accurately planckian ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : tom ] of appendix  [ app : d2 ] ) over a wide range of frequencies even when the temperature significantly differs from the relativistic one .",
    "in addition , in strongly dispersive regimes , i.e. for @xmath34 , it was found that @xmath28 still diverges like @xmath35 for @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "hence , in all cases , the low - frequency part of the spectrum is governed by the effective temperature @xmath37 we define the _ hawking regime _ by situations where @xmath38 differs from @xmath39 by less than 10% .",
    "we aim to determine the extension of this regime when introducing short - distance dispersion .    in a stationary flowing atomic bose condensate , the dispersion relation of phonons",
    "is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the conserved frequency @xmath42 , @xmath43 the wave vector @xmath44 , @xmath45 the atom mass , @xmath27 the speed of sound at the horizon , and @xmath46 the frequency associated with the healing length @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",
    "this dispersion relation directly follows from the bogoliubov - de  gennes equation  @xcite , see eq .   in appendix",
    "[ app : system ] , where more details can be found .",
    "because of dispersion , as mentioned above , upstream wave packets no longer follow null geodesics . yet , when they propagate in the nhr , the exponential decay law of eq .",
    "is still satisfied when @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "but what is essential here is that the trajectories stay in the nhr only for a finite time , even when the above inequalities are not satisfied . as a result , unlike what is found in de  sitter space , the accumulated redshift effect saturates at a finite value ( when the asymptotic values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 are finite , which is the case we shall consider ) . to quantify this saturation , we use @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the asymptotic values of the ingoing and outgoing wave numbers , solutions of eq .   with @xmath54 , see appendix  [ app : system ] .",
    "these roots describe the negative frequency partner which is trapped in the supersonic region , on the left of the horizon .",
    "as we shall see , the number of e - folds @xmath55 , or its exponential @xmath56 , offers a simple description of the low - frequency spectrum outside the hawking regime .",
    "it is thus important to determine how it depends on the dispersive scale @xmath46 and on the flow profile parameters .    to reduce the number of these parameters",
    ", we impose @xmath57 by introducing the parameter @xmath58 , we specify how @xmath13 is shared between @xmath11 and @xmath10 . in the forthcoming numerical simulations , we shall not use special values of @xmath58 , such as 0 ( constant flow velocity ) or 1 ( constant speed of sound ) , in order to obtain results which are generically valid .",
    "notice that @xmath59 is also particular as it minimizes the coupling between right- and left - going waves  @xcite . as a representative value of the generic case ,",

    "this latter fact renders @xmath62 a very relevant spectral parameter in the presence of dispersion  @xcite .    to compute @xmath56 of eq .  , we need to analyze the two roots of eq .   with @xmath65 .",

    "above which there is no radiation .",
    "however , it is more subtle to understand why @xmath7 also determines the low - frequency ( @xmath83 ) properties of the spectrum .",
    "a detailed analysis  @xcite of the connection formula governing the scattering on the sonic horizon confirms that the first deviations from the hawking spectrum are governed by the particular combination of @xmath46 and @xmath62 entering in @xmath7 . from eq .",

    "when ignoring greybody factors , the spectral properties of @xmath85 are analytically known in the hawking regime which is found in the dispersionless limit ( @xmath86 , fixed @xmath4 ) . in the opposite limit of infinite surface gravity ( @xmath87 , fixed @xmath46 ) ,",

    "this scaling is in perfect agreement with the steplike prediction of eq .  .",
    "this is further confirmation of the applicability of steplike techniques in a wide region of parameters .",
    "however , unlike @xmath38 and @xmath100 which are well - approximated by using a steplike profile only for @xmath131 , their ratio behaves as @xmath135 in the whole plane .",
    "this means that @xmath134 scales in the same way in the hawking and in the steplike regimes .",
    "we also emphasize that @xmath134 is maximal for large values of @xmath62 .",
    "this is also rather unexpected because the coupling between right and left sectors is a nonadiabatic effect .",
    "the coupling should thus be smaller for smoother profiles  @xcite .",
    "when adding high - frequency dispersion to a two - dimensional conformally invariant massless field  @xcite , this is indeed the case , see fig .",
    "19 in ref .",
    "however , when using the quasiparticle wave equation of some condensed matter model , the opposite behavior is found , see e.g. figs .  11 and  12 of @xcite . combining these results with the present analysis of step functions ,",
    "it is now clear that the spectrum @xmath89 of left movers increases with @xmath62 even though the profile is smoother for larger @xmath62 .",
    "to summarize the results , we schematically illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] the validity regions of the two regimes .",
    "the region where the temperature @xmath38 differs from @xmath39 by less than 10% is shaded in dark gray , whereas that approximately governed by a steplike profile is shaded in light gray .",
    "we reemphasize that the expressions obtained using a steplike profile provide very good approximations not only where @xmath136 is large ( right lower corner ) , but in general when @xmath113 is small , independently of the value of @xmath136 .    .",
    "it is clear that @xmath116 governs the extension of the two domains and the transition between them . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] , we see that the white area from @xmath137 is not covered by either approximation . to characterize the effective temperature in this transitory regime",

    "transposing these notions to the present context , the boundary of the region where the hawking regime ceases to be valid should thus be given by the condition that the extension of the nhr of eq .",

    "second , we point out that our analysis can be used to characterize the outcome of recent and future experimental investigations aiming to detect the analogue hawking effect .",
    "indeed , the knowledge of @xmath112 and @xmath120 suffices to determine in which regime one will find the ( low - frequency part of the ) quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "for instance , a steplike analysis should be appropriate for experiments in optical fibers or glasses since these are characterized by a small parameter @xmath62 , typically of order @xmath161  @xcite , in spite of the fact that @xmath130 .",
    "thus , in these cases , a precise knowledge of the surface gravity is not required to predict the spectrum . on the contrary , for experiments using as analogue system phonons in bose - einstein condensates  @xcite or gravity waves on water  @xcite ,",
