    "the diffuse , ionized medium ( dim ) , a.k.a the `` reynolds layer , '' has been established to occupy a significant fraction of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and to have a vertical scale height of @xmath16 1 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is widely believed that ob associations are the sources of radiation responsible for ionizing the reynolds layer ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is still unclear how this ionizing radiation is able to travel so far from the ob associations immediate vicinity . in a previous paper ( @xcite ,",
    "hereafter referred to as ds94 ) , we calculated the geometry of diffuse h  ii regions due to ob associations in the galactic plane by assuming a three - component model ( @xcite ) for the vertical distribution of hydrogen . for associations producing an ionizing luminosity @xmath17 s@xmath5 , we found that the h  ii regions are `` density bounded '' in the vertical direction , allowing photons to escape into the halo of our galaxy . by integrating over the luminosity function of associations , @xmath18 ( @xcite )",
    ", we estimated that roughly 7% of ionizing photons , corresponding to a number flux @xmath19",
    "@xmath4 s@xmath5 , escape each side of the h  i disk layer in the solar vicinity and penetrate the dim layer . if this radiation is absorbed in the dim , assumed to lie entirely above the hi layer",
    ", the corresponding photoionization rate would be comparable to the recombination rate implied by the h@xmath20 emission measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "if roughly one - third of this radiation escapes the galactic halo , this flux is also consistent with the estimated flux required to photoionize the magellanic stream and several high velocity clouds in the solar vicinity ( @xcite ) . rather than assuming a purely diffuse ism , @xcite considered the effects of a statistical distribution of small opaque clouds , also decreasing with increasing galactic height and embedded within the diffuse gas .",
    "these authors found that the resulting h  ii regions are consistent with the observations of dispersion measures and h@xmath20 emission measurements .",
    "although these results are encouraging , no models to date consider the role of dynamic chimneys and superbubbles produced by the ob associations .",
    "these considerations are the focus of this paper .",
    "we recently became aware of a preprint on a similar topic ( @xcite ) .",
    "for an ob association , the stars that produce most of the ionizing radiation have strong stellar winds and form supernovae after their relatively short lifetime .",
    "therefore , shortly after the formation of an ob association , a superbubble will form , with a thin shell behind the shock front excavating a large cavity of hot gas ( @xcite ) . for a sufficiently large association , the superbubble can break out of the h  i disk , forming a dynamic chimney , where the hot cavity penetrates into the halo ( @xcite ) .",
    "as we discuss below , the shells of the expanding superbubbles quickly trap the ionizing radiation , so that no radiation can escape the disk until blowout . after blowout , a large fraction ( @xmath16 10% per side ) of ionizing radiation",
    "can directly escape the disk of the galaxy by propagating through the dynamic chimney .",
    "however , this is a viable mechanism for transporting the ionizing radiation only if an appreciable amount of ionizing radiation is still being produced within the cavity after the dynamic chimney has formed .",
    "we find that , for both a coeval star formation history or a non - coeval model having a star formation rate given by a gaussian with a full - width half - maximum @xmath21 myr ( @xcite ) , a small fraction of the ionizing radiation produced by an association over its lifetime is emitted after the time of blowout . therefore , most of the radiation that escapes the disk does so early in the early stages of the superbubble .",
    "integrating over the luminosity function , we find that the fraction of ionizing photons _ currently _ being emitted by ob associations that escape each side of the h  i disk is @xmath22% for the coeval star - formation history and @xmath23% for the gaussian star - formation history .",
    "the aim of this paper is to predict the fraction of ionizing radiation , emitted by ob associations , that escapes the h  i disk of the galaxy .",
    "as discussed above , ds94 assumed that the reynolds layer lies above the h  i layer .",
    "therefore , the question of whether the reynolds layer is sustained via hot star photoionization is equivalent to whether enough radiation can penetrate through the h  i layer . in this paper",
    ", we regard this assumption as too simplistic .",
    "the reynolds layer has a scale height of roughly 1 kpc , whereas the h  i disk has a scale height of @xmath24 pc ( @xcite ) but extends to at least 1 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , a significant fraction ( e.g. , @xmath25% ) of the of the ionized gas may lie within the h  i layer , reducing the flux of ionizing radiation required to escape the h  i disk .",
    "a self - consistent model , modeling the distribution of the photoionized gas , is not feasible until the density distribution of the hydrogen gas , both within the disk and in the halo , is determined more accurately .    in  2",
    ", we discuss our treatment of the evolution of the superbubble and the radiation transfer of ionizing photons emitted by an association through the expanding superbubble and the diffuse ism of the disk .",
    "we also discuss our treatment of the blowout event of the superbubble , where the cavity evolves into a dynamic chimney . in  3 , we determine the time dependence of the fraction of ionizing photons , emitted by a single ob association , that escape the h  i disk .",
    "integrating over the luminosity function of ob associations , we determine the fraction of ionizing radiation , currently being emitted by ob associations , that escapes the h  i disk . in  4 , we discuss key issues not included in our standard model , including shell instabilities , a two - phase ism , `` poisoning '' by photoablated gas , and triggered star formation .",
    "we then discuss how these effects may alter our results . in  5 , we discuss the implications of our results and give our conclusions .",
    "consider a large association having @xmath26 stars in the @xmath27 mass range .",
    "due to the stellar winds from the massive stars and type ii supernovae , the association produces a mechanical luminosity , @xmath28@xmath29 , that varies with time .",
    "this energy input drives an expanding superbubble .",
    "assuming an initially uniform density distribution of the diffuse ism , and that all of the swept - up mass resides in a thin shell ( the kompaneets approximation , @xcite ) , the radius , @xmath30 , of the cavity is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath31 = \\frac{6 { \\ensuremath{r_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm sh}}}}^2}{\\pi\\rho}{\\ensuremath{l_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm mech}}}}(t),\\ ] ] where the mass density @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the number density of hydrogen , and @xmath34 is the proton mass . for a given time - dependent mechanical luminosity prescription , this equation is integrated numerically using a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "we note that this formalism is technically valid only for a uniform density distribution , as the shock wave does not evolve with spherical symmetry for non - uniform density distributions .",
    "however , as we show in  3 , for most association sizes the expanding shell becomes optically thick to the ionizing radiation before the shock has propagated a distance of a disk scale height , within which using a constant density is a good approximation .",
    "therefore , the amount of escaping ionizing radiation is insensitive to the errors produced by neglecting the non - spherical propagation that occurs at large galactic heights .",
    "the time dependence of the mechanical luminosity depends on the initial mass function ( imf ) of stars within an ob association and the star formation history of the association . for this paper",
    ", we use the ob association evolution models of @xcite , which determine both the mechanical luminosity and the luminosity of ionizing photons as a function of time for individual stars from the latest stellar evolutionary tracks and stellar atmospheres .",
    "these authors used an imf given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 for the stellar mass range @xmath37 ( @xcite ) , for which all stars eventually become supernovae .",
    "the massive star - formation history of the association is given by @xmath38 , with the constraint that @xmath39 , where the limits of integration span the entire lifetime of the association .",
    "in this paper , we consider two star - formation histories ( sfhs ) : ( 1 ) coeval [ @xmath40 , and ( 2 ) noncoeval with a gaussian distribution [ @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "for the gaussian sfh , the imf is assumed to be constant in time .    for each sfh , @xmath42 and",
    "@xmath43 were obtained from @xcite . here",
    ", we used a monte - carlo simulation to determine the mass distribution of individual associations having a total mass of @xmath44 ( corresponding to an average association size of @xmath45 stars , or roughly @xmath46 massive stars ) .",
    "the average luminosity curves are then normalized , and , for an arbitrary association size , the luminosity curves are given by the product of the normalized curves and @xmath47 .",
    "note that this formalism ignores all possible deviations about the average luminosities due to statistical fluctuations of the stellar mass distribution of small associations .",
    "@xcite found that these fluctuations become significant for @xmath48 .",
    "however , as shown below , most of the escaping radiation in our galaxy emanates from associations with @xmath49 , so the importance of the statistical fluctuations of small associations is minor for our purposes . even if the small associations were important , when calculating the total fraction of escaping photons , we integrate over many associations , so the use of the average luminosities should yield a good approximation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lvst ] , we show the mechanical luminosity and the mach number of the shell as a function of time for an ob association having @xmath50 , for coeval star - formation history and for a gaussian star - formation history with @xmath21 myr .",
    "the mach number of the shock front is @xmath51 , where the effective sound speed of the medium is @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath54 is the temperature of the gas ( assumed equal to @xmath55 k and the shock front is assumed to be isothermal ) , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the ratio of the magnetic pressure plus turbulent pressure to the thermal pressure . as discussed in  [ sec : blowout ] , the superbubble is modeled as instantaneously blowing out of the disk and becoming a dynamic chimney when the bubble radius exceeds the transition height , @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that @xmath58 is twice the scale height of the h  i gas distribution , @xmath59 .",
    "after blowout , the cylindrical radius continues to expand due to conservation of momentum .",
    "once the mach number reaches unity , the expansion of the cavity is halted .",
    "the fluctuations in the mechanical luminosity arise from supernovae occurring separately in time due to the different lifetimes of individual stars .",
    "although @xmath42 is given by the average of several monte - carlo simulations , the fluctuations have not been smoothed out .",
    "we note that , for the gaussian sfh , the mach number is near zero until 1.3 myr , when it then rises quickly .",
    "this behavior is due to our initial treatment of the bubble growth for low mechanical luminosities .",
    "since we start the simulation at a time @xmath60 before the peak star - formation rate , the initial luminosity is small for small associations . in such cases",
    ", the mach number rapidly drops below unity , then subsequently increases as the energy input increases . in reality",
    ", the shock front associated with these small associations would stagnate when the ambient pressure of the ism is equal to the internal pressure of the bubble , causing the kompaneets approximation to break down . as the proper hydrodynamic treatment of the growth of a stagnated bubble is outside the scope of this paper",
    ", we employed the following procedure for approximating the bubble evolution . for each association size , we determine the time at which the mechanical luminosity exceeded @xmath61 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "we then evaluate the mach number at this time using the solution of equation ( [ eq : kompaneets ] ) for a constant luminosity , where the time - averaged luminosity is used .",
    "if the mach number is below unity , we assume that the shock has stagnated , set the shell velocity to zero , and continue integrating equation ( [ eq : kompaneets ] ) .",
    "although the use of kompaneet s equation is not valid for mach numbers below unity , we argue that the errors introduced are negligible since the time interval for the shell to accelerate to mach numbers above unity is small relative to the sound - crossing time of the bubble .",
    "therefore , the shell does not diffuse much into the cavity during the stagnation period .",
    "furthermore , during this early interval of the cavity , the photon luminosity of the association is also low , and no radiation escapes the disk of the galaxy regardless of the bubble geometry .",
    "finally , by comparing @xmath62 using this method with results when equation ( [ eq : kompaneets ] ) is integrated without intervention , we found that the two were identical for @xmath63 myr .",
    "the only ramification of our stagnation treatment is that smaller associations take longer to blow out of the disk . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : instabilities ] , the acceleration of stagnated bubbles due to the mechanical luminosity increasing in time can cause rayleigh - taylor instabilities to begin at a much earlier stage , compared to the case of constant luminosity , where acceleration occurs at the time of blowout ( @xcite ) . this instability may dramatically increase the amount of ionizing radiation that escapes the h  i disk .      for large ob associations that have a sufficiently high mechanical luminosity",
    ", superbubbles can blow out of a vertically stratified h  i disk , producing dynamic chimneys ( @xcite ) .",
    "blowout occurs if the shell of the superbubble is still supersonic when it reaches a height , @xmath64 , where it begins to accelerate due to decreasing density distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "this height depends on the density distribution of the ism and @xmath65 ; for gaussian or exponential distributions it is @xmath66 ( @xcite ) . for most association sizes and star formation histories ,",
    "the timescale for reaching @xmath67  is considerably longer than the timescale for propagating from this height into the galactic halo ( @xmath68 kpc ) .",
    "therefore , rather than calculating the exact evolution of the superbubble during blowout , we model the process as an instantaneous transition from a bubble into a dynamic chimney once the shell reaches a transition height @xmath69 . we note that , due to the existence of the h  i gas at high @xmath70 , blowout may first occur at heights considerably larger than @xmath71 or may not occur at all .",
    "in addition , magnetic fields could inhibit blowout ( @xcite ) . as discussed below",
    ", our results are insensitive to the exact value of @xmath72 , since most ionizing radiation that escapes the disk does so shortly after the formation of the ob association .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties regarding the process of blowout are unimportant for our estimation of the flux of escaping ionizing radiation .    the geometry of the dynamic chimney is approximated as a cylinder , centered on the ob association , with radius @xmath73  and height @xmath74 .",
    "since we are only interested in how much ionizing radiation escapes the h  i disk of the galaxy , we do not attempt to model the structure of the superbubble / chimney for heights more than @xmath75 disk scaleheights ( @xmath76 kpc ) . numerical simulations of superbubbles blowing out of stratified disks ( @xcite ) show that a cylinder is a decent approximation for the geometry of the cavity within the h  i disk . above the disk",
    ", the shell takes the appearance of a mushroom cloud , with the shell clumping and fragmenting due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities . for this paper",
    ", we assume that any radiation that reaches a height @xmath74  and is within the dynamic chimney escapes the disk . the question of whether this radiation is absorbed by the `` mushroom cap '' of the shell or escapes due to the shell having a small covering fraction is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "even if the covering fraction of the `` mushroom cap '' is not negligible , it is possible that this gas , photoionized by the ob association , is part of the reynolds layer .",
    "therefore , it is fair to include this radiation when assessing whether the amount of escaping radiation can ionize the dim .      throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume that ionization equilibrium is satisfied instantaneously .",

    "however , for dynamic chimneys , the trajectories of the shell deviate from radial lines since the superbubble evolves from a sphere into a cylindrical cavity .",
    "technically , the column density of the shell for a vertical height @xmath70 would be given by the line integral of the density of the diffuse ism along the trajectory that leads to the chimney wall at a height @xmath70 .",
    "the trajectories can be determined by requiring them to be perpendicular to the surface of the expanding shock wave . for an isothermal atmosphere",

    "notice that the fraction of escaping photons , @xmath138 , rapidly decreases for @xmath139 myr .",
    "in fact , for @xmath140 , roughly 90% of the time - integrated flux of escaping radiation occurs within the first 2.7 myr , while only 72% of the time - integrated flux of ionizing radiation has been emitted by this time .",
    "the reason for this rapid decrease is that , as the column density of the shell accumulates , the ionizing radiation is very quickly trapped within the shell , causing the fraction of escaping photons to drop to zero .",
    "once the ionization front is trapped within the shell , the fraction of escaping photons remains zero unless the superbubble blows out of the h  i disk .",
    "( we have not considered shell fragmentation ) .",
    "if blowout occurs , photons can directly escape through the chimney ( a small fraction can also escape by penetrating through the upper h  ii disk ) , causing @xmath141 to jump up to @xmath142% .",
    "however , by the time of blowout , which occurs at @xmath143 myr for @xmath144 and @xmath145 myr for @xmath146 , the photon luminosity is considerably lower than its peak luminosity ( which occurs at @xmath147 myr ) .",
    "therefore , the luminosity of escaping radiation is significantly lower compared to its value for @xmath148 myr .          in figure",

    "since the shell expands more slowly compared to the coeval sfh ( having the same value of @xmath47 ) , the column density of the shell does not increase as quickly .",
    "in addition , due to the lower mach number of the shock front , the shell density is lower than that of the coeval sfh .",
    "for these two reasons , @xmath150  does not fall off in time as quickly as in the coeval case after it reaches its peak value .",
    "nevertheless , the shell does attenuate significantly the flux of escaping radiation . in figure",
    "[ fig : etaesct2 ] , for @xmath50 , we compare the flux of escaping radiation as a function of time with that for the case where no dynamics are considered ( e.g. , as done by ds94 but using the time - dependent photon luminosity ) . for @xmath151 myr ,",
    "the shell becomes becomes efficient in reducing the escaping flux .",
    "therefore , as with the coeval sfh , most of the escaping radiation escapes early , within a short time interval relative to the lifetime of the ob association .",
    "the time - integrated flux of photons that escape the disk after blowout is considerably small relative to the lifetime - integrated flux .",
    "for example , for @xmath140 , fewer than 3% of the photons that escape the disk over the lifetime of the association escape after blowout ( while fewer than 4% of the photons emitted by the association are produced after blowout ) .",
    "for @xmath50 , approximately 1% escape after blowout .",
    "these values are not much different than for the coeval sfh .",
    "the reason for this insensitivity is that as @xmath152 is increased ( @xmath153 for coeval star - formation ) , the blowout timescale is also increased .",
    "thus , even though there are more stars alive at longer times for noncoeval sfhs , there are still relatively few alive at the time of blowout .              the time - integrated fraction of escaping photons for each side of the h  i disk by an association of size @xmath26 is given by @xmath154 in figure [ fig : time - int - eta ] we plot @xmath155 for both the coeval sfh and the noncoeval gaussian star - formation model . for reference ,",
    "the maximum photon luminosity of an association over its lifetime is @xmath156 ( @xmath79 s@xmath5 ) for coeval star - formation and @xmath157 ( @xmath79 s@xmath5 ) for the gaussian sfh .",
    "note that @xmath158 is smaller for all values of @xmath47  for the gaussian sfh .",
    "there are several reasons for this difference .",
    "one reason is that , for a given value of @xmath47 , the gaussian sfh has a peak photon luminosity that is roughly a factor of two smaller than that of the coeval model .",
    "therefore , even if the shell structures of the superbubble were identical during the interval of maximum luminosity , the maximum value of @xmath150  for the gaussian model would be smaller since @xmath141 increases with increasing photon luminosity ( ds94 ) .",
    "in addition , the luminosity profile @xmath43 for the coeval model is much more peaked , with @xmath159% of its lifetime - integrated luminosity emitted within the first @xmath160 myr , compared to the relatively broad distribution of @xmath43 for the gaussian sfh .",
    "thus , since @xmath158 is weighted by @xmath43 , and @xmath161 is near its peak value while @xmath43 is near its peak value , the coeval sfhs yield higher values .",

    "since the range of association luminosities is several orders of magnitude , and the value of @xmath195 is very uncertain , we regard this discrepancy as negligible . note that the reason for any differences between the two luminosity functions is due to our prescription that the implicit luminosity function is truncated at @xmath195 .",

    "[ sec : etaescavg ] , @xmath206  for the gaussian sfh is considerably lower than that for the coeval sfh . by",
    "far , @xmath206  is most sensitive to the power - law index of the luminosity function , @xmath194 .",
    "this sensitivity arises because most of the escaping radiation comes from the relatively few large associations with @xmath49 ; small changes in @xmath194 cause rather large changes in the relative number of these large associations .",
    "for the coeval sfh , @xmath206  is insensitive to the magnetic field ( the parameter @xmath57 ) . as the superbubble expands ,",
    "the column density of the shell increases quickly , causing @xmath201 to drop to zero very quickly even for strong magnetic fields . for the gaussian sfh , the superbubble expands more slowly , and different values of @xmath57 cause the shell to trap the ionization front at different times .",
    "since this trapping of the i - front occurs near the peak of @xmath43 , @xmath206  is more sensitive to @xmath57 .",
    "lastly , we do not plot how @xmath206  depends on the parameters involved with the superbubble blowout ( e.g. , @xmath58  and @xmath74 ) , as we found that varying these parameter over a range between @xmath59 and @xmath207 corresponded to a relative change of @xmath206  less than 1% .",
    "this insensitivity occurs because most emitted and escaping photons occur early after the formation of the association .",
    "we now discuss the key issues not included in our standard model .",
    "we then discuss how these effects may alter our results .",
    "as discussed above , the presence of a thick neutral shell of cool , shocked ism produced by multiple supernova explosions is quite effective in absorbing the radiation coming from the ob association .",
    "this process significantly reduces the fraction of photons able to escape into the galactic halo until blowout takes place . at that stage , the previously decelerating shell",
    "is suddenly accelerated and the interface between the dense shell and the hot cavity gas becomes rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) unstable .",
    "the nonlinear development of such instability induces fragmentation of the shell into a number of clumps , through which the photons can percolate and almost freely escape into the halo .",
    "this process generally occurs relatively late ( or not at all ) , when the radiative flux has already decreased by a considerable amount due to the aging of the parent ob association .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to investigate if the fragmentation process driven by r - t or other instabilities can take place before blowout , consequently increasing @xmath206 .",
    "there are at least three types of instabilities that could affect the shell at the beginning or during the pressure - driven radiative ( pdr ) phase : 1 ) dynamical , 2 ) rayleigh - taylor and 3 ) gravitational . to assess the importance of these processes , it is necessary to discuss in more detail the development of the shell structure for sn bubbles .",
    "we restrict our discussion to uniform ambient gas density , which is a reasonable approximation to study the pre - blowout phase .",
    "the structure of a wind - blown bubble ( the energy injection by multiple sne can be well approximated as a continuous process ) is constituted by a reverse (  wind \" ) shock propagating back into the wind , which is under most conditions adiabatic , and an  ambient \" shock propagating into the surrounding medium ; the two shocks are separated by a contact discontinuity .",
    "initially , the ambient shock is also adiabatic and its radius increases with time as @xmath208 .",
    "however , when the cooling time of the shocked ambient gas becomes of the order of the age of the bubble , the ambient shock becomes radiative and the shocked ambient gas collapses into a thin shell .",
    "the shell - formation phase is characterized by violent dynamical instabilities which tend to amplify the perturbation due to classical thermal instability in the catastrophically cooling shocked ambient gas .",
    "are these instabilities able to disrupt the shell soon after its formation ?",
    "at least three different dynamical instabilities may arise in the thin , cool shell : nonradial oscillations of the radiative shock ( @xcite ) , the nonlinear thin - shell ( ntsi ) instability arising when the shell is bounded by two radiative shocks ( @xcite ) , and the pressure - driven thin - shell overstability ( pdtso ) found in a shell bounded by a high thermal pressure on one side and by a radiative shock on the other ( @xcite ) .",
    "these dynamical instabilities may produce considerable distortions in the shell , often showing nonradial oscillations .",
    "the main difference between the latter two instabilities is that while the ntsi grows exponentially , the pdtso only grows with a power - law rate .",
    "recent numerical simulations ( @xcite ) have shown that the pdtso is probably the most dangerous instability , especially for superbubbles where the wind shock is adiabatic rather than radiative for a large fraction of its evolution .",
    "however , the pdtso works only for the time during which the mach number of the shell is larger than @xmath209 .",
    "as the pdtso grows with time as @xmath210 with @xmath211 , whereas the shock velocity decreases as @xmath212 ( see equation [ [ radius ] ] below ) in the radiative phase , amplifications @xmath213 are typically possible , i.e. the overstability saturates .",
    "the above numerical studies concluded on this basis that fragmentation of the shell due to these instabilities is unlikely , although @xcite emphasize that in a denser ism the shock enters the radiative phase at a higher mach number , thus allowing for a longer growth time of the instability .",
    "even if the shell can survive dynamical instabilities , it can be fragmented by r - t instabilities generated _ before _ blowout .",
    "as the radiative bubble expands , its pressure drops and eventually becomes equal to the that of the ism . in this case , the wind shock stalls , but the shocked wind is still adiabatic and forces the shell to continue its expansion .",
    "however , the expansion rate is now so slow that the acceleration of the shell is dominated by the galactic gravitational field .",
    "thus , the polar region of the shell will be r - t unstable even in the absence of a blowout .",
    "we calculate the time at which the pressure - confined phase occurs ( and hence the r - t instability starts to grow ) as follows . for constant luminosity , the evolution of the shell radius in the radiative phase is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the wind mechanical luminosity , @xmath80 is the ambient gas number density , and @xmath216 . from the pressure balance condition @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the ism effective sound speed , this transition occurs at @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the ism effective sound speed .",
    "the growth time of the r - t instability on spatial scales @xmath221 is @xmath222^{-1/2 } \\simeq \\left({2\\pi g \\over \\lambda_s }",
    "\\right)^{-1/2 } \\sim 1{\\rm ~myr}\\ ] ] if the density contrast between the shell and the hot cavity gas @xmath223 and @xmath224 cm s@xmath168 .",
    "as @xmath225 is much shorter than @xmath226 , the shell is fragmented soon after it enters the pressure - confined phase . for the case of a gaussian sfh ,",
    "the mechanical luminosity is initially very low , causing the shock to stagnate much earlier than the constant - luminosity case .",
    "in addition , the shell can be re - accelerated early in its evolutionary stage shortly after the first supernovae of the association due to the sudden increase in the mechanical luminosity .",
    "we have numerically evaluated @xmath227 due to this process assuming the kompaneets approximation is valid , and find that the product of @xmath227 and the duration of the re - acceleration ( typically @xmath228 myr ) is @xmath229 .",
    "thus , the growth of the instability is moderately non - linear .",
    "a more detailed study of this process , including the role of poisoning , will be given in @xcite .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the case of a constant mechanical luminosity , the shell can be r - t unstable before blowout . in this case , a fragmenting shell would allow a higher amount of ionizing radiation to escape the h  i disk since fragmentation occurs during the time interval in which the photon luminosity of the association is near its peak value .",
    "the shell might also be fragmented by a gravitational instability .",
    "several studies have investigated this possibility , both under interstellar ( @xcite ) and intergalactic conditions ( @xcite ) . here , we simply state the the growth time of the most unstable mode is @xmath230 again , we see that this mechanism is able to fragment the shell on time scales of interest and similar to the ones found for the r - t instability . we conclude that , even in the absence of blowout , fragmentation of the shell is likely about @xmath231  yr after the beginning of the energy injection .",
    "even if the shells of superbubbles do not blow out , do they fragment while the ob association is still producing ionizing photons ?",
    "simple conditions on the occurrence of blowout have been derived in different contexts by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "neglecting the role of magnetic fields , @xcite studied in detail the case for the milky way and concluded that the blowout requires @xmath232 . for a marginally confined bubble",
    ", we find from equation ( [ tpres ] ) and equation ( [ ggrow ] ) that @xmath233  yr and @xmath234  yr for the r - t and the gravitational instability , respectively .",
    "note that , as @xmath235 is decreased , fragmentation occurs earlier in time .",
    "thus , even bubbles that do not blow out of the disk can fragment on time scales short enough that at least some ionizing photons escape . determining the covering fraction of the fragmented clumps",
    "is outside the scope of the present estimates and will require numerical simulations of the fragmentation process . as a final caveat , we stress that a dynamically important magnetic field could qualitatively modify the above conclusions by suppressing some of the instabilities ( @xcite ) and by introducing new ones .",
    "although our models assume that , outside the superbubbles , the neutral gas is distributed diffusely , there is observational evidence that a significant fraction of the gas is in cold h  i clouds , with densities much larger than the space - averaged density .",
    "due to the higher recombination rates , these clouds modify our radiation - transfer results and therefore merit some consideration . since most radiation that escapes the h  i disk comes from young ob associations , with shells having small column densities , we considered the ramifications of a clumpy medium by ignoring the effects of evolving superbubbles .",
    "a more proper treatment would consider the time - dependent evolution of the clouds due to passage of the shell of the superbubble as well as the expansion and evaporation of the clouds after being photoionized .    as an approximate model ,",
    "we let a mass - fraction of the gas , @xmath236 , be contained in cold , dense clouds .",

    "for a fixed amount of gas locked in cold clouds , spherical clouds occupy a smaller solid angle as compared to thin cylindrical clouds , allowing more radiation to escape .",
    "note that , since we did not consider superbubbles in these calculations , these numbers are only indicative of the _ relative _ decrease of @xmath7 when cold clouds are included in the model .",
    "although the survey used for calibrating the production rate of ionizing photons is heavily biased towards associations far away from the parent molecular cloud , most if not all associations were born in a molecular cloud . therefore , early in the lifetime of the ob association , it is possible that a considerable amount of matter is photoablated from the molecular cloud .",
    "this material increases the interior density of the bubble , leading to radiative cooling , potentially at a rate equal to the the injected mechanical luminosity , a process independently dubbed `` poisoning '' by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this poisoning process can alter the evolution of a young superbubble , as well as the propagation of the i - front through the cavity .    to date",
    ", the photoablation rate has not been calculated for a time - varying luminosity of an ob cluster with a proper radiation spectrum .",
    "in addition , for a given mass - injection rate , solving the evolution of the injected gas within the cavity is a complex problem .",
    "these complexities lead to uncertainties in the radiative cooling rate , both in magnitude and in its time evolution .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the degree to which poisoning alters the evolution of the superbubble and @xmath206 , we introduced a factor , @xmath288 , representing the fraction of the mechanical luminosity injected into the cavity that is drained due to radiative cooling from both photoablated gas and evaporated gas from the dense shell .",
    "thus , @xmath289 is the portion of energy available to do @xmath290 work . in what we consider an extreme case",
    ", we let @xmath291 for the duration in which @xmath292 is less than @xmath293 pc [ see @xcite for a discussion of when cooling due to poisoning becomes negligible ] . in this case , for our non - coeval model , we find that @xmath206  _ increases _ by roughly 35% .",
    "this increase occurs because the superbubble shell expands more slowly , and the density of the shell is smaller ( it is proportional to the mach number squared of the shell ) , and because the column density of the shell increases more slowly .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that enough material is photoablated into the hot cavity that , after recombining , it contributes to the absorption of ionizing radiation emitted by the ob association , partially offsetting the increase in @xmath206  due to the slower shell expansion .",
    "however , to model this process requires a knowledge of the relative configurations of the molecular cloud , the ob association , and the disk of the galaxy . also , the evolution of the injected gas , especially the expansion of the gas as it expands from the molecular cloud or shell boundaries and into the the line - of - sight between the ob association and the halo , is a numerical problem beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the fraction of ionizing radiation escaping the h  i disk would be increased if an appreciable number of ob associations were formed within pre - existing dynamic chimneys .",
    "the two - dimensional filling factor of dynamic chimneys is estimated by @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the fraction of ob associations that are large enough to produce a dynamic chimney , @xmath296 is the lifetime of the cavity , and @xmath297 is the radius of the cavity . as discussed in  [ sec : instabilities ] , associations having an average mechanical luminosity @xmath298 erg s@xmath5 are thought to be capable of blowing out of the galactic disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to an ob association size of @xmath299 , or a peak luminosity @xmath300 s@xmath5 .",
    "the fraction of associations that produce a dynamic chimney is then @xmath301 where we assumed @xmath302 . for @xmath185 and @xmath303 s@xmath5 , @xmath304 .",
    "the lifetime of the dynamic chimney is estimated to be the sound crossing time , @xmath305 therefore , the probability that an ob association is born within a dynamic chimney is given by @xmath306 and it is unlikely that @xmath7 is enhanced significantly by this process if ob associations are born randomly in space . however , as suggested by @xcite , the birth of ob associations could be triggered by the passage of the shock wave associated with another superbubble .",
    "indeed , recent far ultraviolet , h@xmath20 , and h  i observations of several dwarf galaxies show evidence of secondary star - formation sites on the dense h  i rims of superbubbles ( @xcite ) .",

    "however , using costar model atmospheres , @xcite found that the yield of ionizing photons from ob associations is 50% higher than previously estimated , and the production rate of ionizing photons by ob associations in the solar vicinity is @xmath324 @xmath4 s@xmath5 .",
    "thus , the required value of @xmath206  to sustain the reynolds layer is reduced to @xmath325% .",
    "the flux of escaping radiation for the gaussian sfh is about 25% smaller than this required value .",
    "however , as discussed in  1 , since a portion of the reynolds layer may reside within the h  i disk , it need not be sustained solely by the radiation escaping the disk .    throughout this paper",
    ", we have assumed that the formation rate of ob associations is constant in time . for starburst galaxies ,",
    "the observed star formation rate is much higher than the time - averaged value .",
    "therefore , since @xmath326 is at a maximum shortly after the formation of an ob association , starburst galaxies having a morphology similar to our galaxy should have higher values of @xmath206  than those predicted for our galaxy .",
    "in addition , starburst galaxies may have lower h  i column densities and lower gravitational fields , also contributing to a higher escape fraction of ionizing radiation .",
    "these considerations will be the focus of our subsequent work .    if ob associations are indeed the sources of radiation responsible for ionizing the reynolds layer , it is possible that an appreciable amount of radiation can escape the galaxy entirely and contribute to the intergalactic radiation field ( @xcite ) . if the average escape fraction from low - redshift , star - forming galaxies exceeds @xmath229% , then the contribution of ionizing radiation to the intergalactic medium by galaxies can exceed the contribution for qsos ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that our models predict only the flux of radiation penetrating the galactic halo , before a portion of it is absorbed by the portion of the reynolds layer situated high above the galactic plane . in order to predict the fraction of radiation that escapes the galaxy entirely",
    ", we need a self - consistent model of the density distribution of hydrogen gas within the halo , including the contribution due to high velocity clouds , whose covering fraction is uncertain .",
    "@xcite found that approximately 37% of 21-cm sightlines near quasars showed hvcs with n@xmath327 @xmath4 .",
    "however , observations with the parkes multibeam survey ( @xcite ) show that the spatial distribution of h  i in the hvcs is filamentary , suggesting that lyman continuum could leak through .",
    "furthermore , the actual hvc coverage fraction will vary considerably around the galaxy , depending on proximity to spiral arms and upwelling superbubbles .    for specificity ,",
    "if we assume @xmath328 , then the upward ionizing flux is @xmath329 @xmath4 s@xmath5 above the h  i disk ( @xmath330 kpc ) .",
    "if this flux is incident on the hvcs , and if we use the relationship between h@xmath20 emission and ionizing flux , for optically thick clouds and photoionization equilibrium ( @xcite ) , then the predicted h@xmath20 emission intensity is @xmath331 this intensity is roughly a factor of two larger than the measured intensities from the magellanic stream ( @xcite ) and the smith hvc ( @xcite ) .    in summary , we have shown that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from star - forming regions of disk galaxies is strongly affected by the presence of superbubbles and a cloudy ism .",
    "the shells of the expanding superbubbles quickly trap or attenuate the ionizing flux , so that most of the escaping radiation escapes shortly after the formation of the superbubble . in our models ,",
    "the escape fraction above 1 kpc range from @xmath332% . for a gaussian sfh ,",
    "@xmath206  is roughly a factor of two lower than the results of @xcite , where superbubbles were not considered .",
    "if @xmath333% , then the upward flux is sufficient to sustain the reynolds layer . we have also examined the radiative transfer in a two - phase ( cloud / intercloud ) medium . we neglect the filling factor of hot , low - density gas ,",
    "consistent with recent o  vi studies .",
    "if a significant fraction of h  i is distributed in cold clouds with @xmath8 @xmath9 and column densities @xmath334 @xmath4 , @xmath7 can be reduced by a factor of @xmath10 if the clouds have a disk geometry .",
    "thus , the amount of ionizing photons that escape the disk into the igm is likely to be highly variable , and will depend on the luminosity distribution of ob associations , the cloud structure , and the massive star formation history . if the escaping lyc radiation is ever observed directly , it will confirm these theoretical expectations but also verify the likelihood that stellar ionizing radiation plays an important role in reionization of the high - redshift igm .",
