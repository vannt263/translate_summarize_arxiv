    "fermions , constrained by the pauli exclusion principle , behave very differently from bosons , to which such a principle does not apply .  in a many particle system , the former tend to stay away from each other , while , on the contrary , the latter tend to be gregarious .  in the most fundamental level , fermions ( leptons and quarks ) are the building block for all the matter with mass , while bosons serve as the mediator for all the fundamental forces in nature .  in spite of this vast difference , when mixed together at temperatures so low that the de broglie wavelength of the particles becomes comparable to or even longer than the interparticle spacing , fermions and bosons can conspire to create fascinating quantum effects at the macroscopic scale that are of fundamental interest across a broad spectrum of physics , especially within the disciplines of condensed matter and nuclear  physics .",
    "as most substances in nature solidify before the temperature could reach the regime where the macroscopic quantum nature of liquid ( or gas ) can be manifested , the combination of liquid isotopes between @xmath0he and @xmath1he @xcite has remained the only laboratory accessible system until recently when the rapid technological advancement in cooling and trapping of neutral atoms has completely turned the situation around .",
    "not only has it resulted  in a dramatic proliferation of such systems , including @xmath2li - @xmath3li @xcite , @xmath2li - @xmath4na @xcite , @xmath5rb -@xmath6k@xcite , @xmath2li - @xmath5rb @xcite , but more significantly , with ultracold atomic gases , important parameters , including the interaction between particles of same or different species , can be tuned precisely @xcite , allowing the physics of fermi - bose mixture to be investigated in a well controlled manner , in regimes possibly well beyond the reach by traditional solid state systems .",
    "recently , by changing the feshbach detuning across a certain critical point at which all the minority atoms pair up with the majority ones to form a molecular bose condensate , the group at mit @xcite has successfully created , from a two - component fermi mixture with population imbalance , a quantum gas where bose molecules are mixed with spin - polarized ( unpaired majority ) fermions .",
    "in addition to confirming an earlier theoretical prediction of the existence of a transition from full miscibility to phase separation @xcite , using the same system , they were able to determine the effective dimer - fermion scattering length within a reasonable agreement with the prediction made more than 50 years ago @xcite but never verified experimentally , once again demonstrating that the ultracold atom system provides an excellent experimental platform for testing theories .",
    "inspired by this work , instead of one fermi state as in a single - component fermi - bose mixture in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider a two - component fermi - bose mixture involving a hyperfine state @xmath7 of a bosonic atom with mass @xmath8 and  two equally populated hyperfine states : spin up @xmath9 and spin down @xmath10 of a fermionic atom with mass @xmath11 .",
    "the latter fermi system when equipped with feshbach resonance has been the main source of inspiration for much recent excitement in the forefront of ultracold atomic physics , due chiefly to the vital role it plays in the study of crossover from bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of tightly bound atom pairs to  nonlocal bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) atom pairs .",
    "thus , mixtures of bosons with such fermi systems shall be widely accessible to experiments .",
    "the low temperature physics of the two - component model under consideration is dominated by s - wave collisions , which , given that the pauli exclusion principle prohibits s - wave scattering between identical fermions , are parameterized with three scattering lengths :  @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , describing , respectively , s - wave scattering between two bosons , between two fermions of opposite spins , and between a boson and a fermion of either spin , assuming that scattering a boson off a spin - up fermion has the same amplitude as that off a spin - down fermion .  in principle",
    ", @xmath12  must be positive necessitated by the bose stability in the mixture , while @xmath14 and @xmath13 can take both positive and negative values as they are not subject to similar constraints .",
    "thus , in spite of the restriction on @xmath12 , such a model can still represent drastically different regimes of physics as far as pairings and instabilities are concerned .  in the present work",
    ", we aim to extend the physics of phase and phase separation at finite temperature from single- to two - component systems where fermions have the opportunity to form correlated bcs pairs .  as a result ,",

    "[ sec : thermodynamical potential ] , we review , within the framework of mean - field theory , the path integration formulation of the finite - temperature thermodynamic potential and derive from it the landau - ginzburg expansion .",
    "in contrast to the existing works for the two - component model @xcite , which have various purposes , we focus on producing phase diagrams in the space made up of chemical potentials , which are intensive statistical variables that must remain invariant among the separated phases and hence uniquely define a phase separation @xcite . this is to be contrasted to spaces where coordinates are served , for example , by particle number densities , of which separated phases in a phase separation have different values @xcite .  in sec .",
    "iii , we apply the analytical intuitions derived from the landau - ginzburg theory to identify as well as to clarify the features that are generic to the finite - temperature phase diagrams within the validity of our model .",

    ",  an advantage of the phase diagram in the chemical potential space is that each phase separation manifests itself as a unique coexistence curve , making its identification particularly transparent .",
    "for example , fig .",

    "the line between b and bn requires a special explanation .  at zero temperature , due to the fermi - dirac distribution",
    ", the chemical potential for a normal state of fermi gas must be positive , and under such a circumstance , the pure bose phase ( b ) is well - defined - the space above line 1 , where the chemical potential is negative @xmath144 , is defined as the phase b.  as temperature increases , the fermi surface becomes less sharply defined , and so does the distinction between b and bn .",
    "in fact , at finite temperature there is nothing to prevent the chemical potential for fermions from becoming negative , just as for distinguishable particles that follow the maxwell s distribution .  in our study here",
    ", the line between b and bn is defined in such a way that the fermi density along this line is 10@xmath145 , a small threshold artificially introduced to indicate that the region in b is virtually free of fermions .",
    "but , we stress that in contrast to the line between bn and bs across which there is a second - order phase transition due to the emergence of the order parameter @xmath51 which breaks the symmetry , there is no real phase transition for fermions across the line between b and bn .",
    "in practice , phase diagrams come in different forms , depending on the application at hands .",
    "a complete mapping of the phase diagram including all the critical points in the chemical potential space as we have done in the previous section is significant , not only because it provides a roadmap for constructing phase diagrams in other spaces , but also because it can greatly facilitate both the identification and the interpretation of the important features emerging from these diagrams .  as an application , we consider , in this section , a double species experiment in which spherically symmetric harmonic trap potentials , @xmath146 , are tuned to differ in such a manner that fermions are tightly confined inside a much larger bec , and use it as a model to explore how the surrounding bosons affect the physics of fermi pairing .",
    "this model is the two - component analog of the single - component system experimentally realized by the mit group in 2002 @xcite .",
    "it also represents an example in which the traps are oppositely arranged compared to those adopted to implement the idea of using a small  trapped bec to probe the properties of a large fermi gas  component @xcite .    in our study below , we assume that the fermi component , although small compared to the bec , is still sufficiently large so that the local - density approximation is directly applicable .",
    "thus , for fermions , we introduce a local chemical potential @xmath147 , in addition to a global chemical potential @xmath34 , which is fixed by the  total particle number .",
    "in contrast , for bosons , owing to its large size , to a good approximation , we  can regard its chemical potential , within the distance  scale in the order of the size of the fermi gas , to be a constant , @xmath33 , independent of the variation of the radial distance @xmath148 .",

    "[ fig : tight](a ) , we can easily arrive at the following qualitative conclusions .",

    "\\(c ) as temperature is further reduced ( the arrow on the left ) , @xmath137 disappears and substituted in its place is the bose - superfluidity mixture ( bs ) .",
    "\\(d ) a further reduction in the temperature completely eliminates @xmath138 , creating a density profile , reminiscent of the high temperature case in ( a ) , except that @xmath137 and @xmath138 in ( a ) are now replaced with @xmath39 and @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "an intriguing aspect of such a mixture is that both critical temperatures and fermi profiles depend strongly on @xmath33 - the chemical potential of the surrounding bec .",
    "as @xmath33  can be independently tuned in experiments , we have at our disposal a convenient tool to selectively access the parts of phase diagrams , that are physically interesting .",
    "suppose that we want to access the first - order phase transition .",
    "we can do so simply by increasing @xmath33 beyond a certain threshold value .",

    "[ fig : tight](a ) [ at the expense of a higher fermi chemical potential ( or density ) and a smaller bs region ] , a density discontinuity is expected to emerge from fermi profiles on a sphere that divides the two phases sharing the same first - order transition line .",

    "a unique advantage of a cold atom system is that its system parameters can be precisely tuned , allowing it to access a larger regime of phase diagrams .",
