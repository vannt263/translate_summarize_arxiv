    "the cherenkov light produced by the penetrating charged particles is observed with pmts .",
    "the signal levels from the pmts are constantly calibrated against the average response to the atmospheric background muons that trigger at the lowest threshold level @xcite . through dedicated experiments @xcite the response to atmospheric background muons arriving from all directions",
    "@xcite has been related to the selection of atmospheric muons arriving predominantly vertically through the center of the sd station .",
    "all signals are thus measured in relative units of vem ( vertical equivalent muon ) , i.e.  relative to the average signal that would be produced by the vertical - centered muon .",
    "although this auto - calibration procedure successfully removes most of the systematics due to the detector changes , there are nevertheless some applications that require a certain degree of knowledge about absolute values .",
    "the absolute number of detected muons and the size of the electromagnetic fraction in the signal are important quantities , e.g.  in studies of hadronic interactions in air - shower cascades @xcite or for the purposes of primary particle identification @xcite , just to name a few . we have developed a detailed simulation of the processes of light detection in the pmts to reproduce known calibration data of the sd stations and allow comparison of real and simulated events .",
    "this study is part of the efforts to produce a complete sd simulation chain for the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",

    "its height is @xmath3{m}$ ] and its radius is @xmath4{m}$ ] . the cherenkov radiation emitted in the water of the sd station",
    "is captured by three 9-inch pmts floating on top of the water container , positioned @xmath3{m}$ ] away from the cylinder axis with @xmath5 separation in azimuth .",
    "the pmts have been produced by photonis ; the particular pmt model xp1805-pa1 used by the pierre auger observatory differs from their stock model xp1805 @xcite only in the additional output from the last dynode . together with the usual anode output these",
    "two are used for the monitoring of the dynode  anode ratio and the low and high gain signal acquisition @xcite .",

    "the glass is composed of borosilicate ( 80% sio@xmath9 , 13% b@xmath9o@xmath9 , and 7% na@xmath9o ) with an index of refraction of @xmath10 and a strong increase of absorption for wavelengths below @xmath11{nm}$ ] .",
    "the photocathode consists of a thin @xmath12{nm}$ ] layer of bi - alkali metal ( kcssb ) and has a wavelength - dependent complex index of refraction @xcite .",
    "based on this kind of geometry and material specifications of the pmt , we developed a simulation model that retains the basic geometry properties of the pmt while simulating in great detail the physical processes leading to the photoelectron emissions .",

    "the reflectivity of the _ mirror _ is set to 97% and only ideal specular reflection is implemented . as in the case of the real pmts , the photocathode on the inner side of the glass is separated from the mirror coating by a transparent gap of @xmath14{mm}$ ] .",
    "the loss of photons in the extended _ neck _ leading to the pmt base is simulated by the 100% absorbing patch with a radius of @xmath15{mm}$ ] placed at the top of the pmt .",
    "the _ multiplier _ structure ( dynode stack ) reaches well into the center of the pmt and is in this particular pmt enclosed in a metallic shield case of cylindrical shape . in the photon - tracking experiments we have found that the proper inclusion of this multiplier volume can greatly influence the number of reflected photons ( see fig .",
    "[ f : photonisexp ] for a clear demonstration on how the parallel beam of light gets focused into the multiplier volume ) .",
    "the multiplier structure is thus simulated with a cylinder of height @xmath16{mm}$ ] and radius @xmath17{mm}$ ] .",
    "it is made of a copper - like metal and its effective reflectivity is set to 30% ( for simplicity specular reflection only ) .",
    "the material of the glass window limits the spectral sensitivity in the short wavelength region .",
    "the borosilicate glass has a cut - off wavelength of @xmath18{nm}$ ] ( the point where it decreases below 10% ) .",
    "we have modeled this property with a simple transmission factor @xmath19 that is imposed upon the entering photons , where @xmath20 is the thickness and @xmath21 is the absorption length of the pmt glass .",

    "the sensitivity of the different types of photocathodes is restricted by the photo - emission threshold for the long wavelengths and can vary with thickness at the short wavelengths .",
    "the bi - alkali component kcssb is practically the universal choice of photocathode material for cherenkov light applications , and although it has been known for almost five decades , the availability of reliable measurements of index of refraction has been rather scarce . in our simulation of the angular and wavelength dependencies of the quantum efficiency",
    "we have used the data points from the experimental compilation of the complex index of refraction from @xcite , where the optical properties of this bi - alkali material of similar thickness have been reviewed for the purposes of the solar neutrino detector sno . due to the limited number of different wavelength measurements we have used a simple linear interpolation of the complex index of refraction with wavelength extension along the lines of newer experimental results from @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ f : indexesw ] ) .",
    "when the photon reaches the thin layer of the photocathode it can either get reflected with probability @xmath25 , it can get transmitted across the layer with effective probability @xmath26 , or it can get absorbed by the photocathode material with probability @xmath27 . if the photon energy in the latter case is larger than the needed exit work , the electron can leave the photocathode .",
    "the corresponding quantum efficiency @xmath28 of the photocathode surface can thus be written as where @xmath29 , the absorption coefficient , depends on incidence angle @xmath30 and wavelength @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the conversion factor .",
    "the conversion factor @xmath32 does not depend on the angle of incidence @xcite but in principle it can still be wavelength dependent @xcite . due to the relatively narrow window of relevant wavelengths imposed by the water absorption ( see fig .  [",
    "f : abs - refl ] ) we approximate the conversion factor @xmath32 for the purposes of our simulations with a constant . in section [",
    "s : conversion - calibration ] , we determine its effective value from the separate _ simulation of the quantum efficiency experiment _ , along the lines of the experiments usually performed by the pmt manufacturers . in the next section",
    "we will derive the second missing parameter @xmath29 .    at this point",
    "it is worth to mention that the quantum efficiency @xmath28 from eq .",
    "is the quantum efficiency of the _ photocathode surface _ and is only indirectly related to the overall quantum efficiency of the pmt , as found in the specifications of the manufacturers .",
    "the main difference comes from the fact that pmts are designed to increase light collection through reflections on the mirror back wall .",
    "this increase is to some degree contained in the pmt specification .",
    "nevertheless , its magnitude depends substantially on the particular way the quoted efficiency is obtained experimentally .",
    "therefore , the quoted efficiency specifications of the pmt always require proper interpretation when used for a photocathode simulation .",
    "this fact is in general relevant also for other physics experiments involving pmts .",
    "studies on pmts usually follow @xcite to derive the angular and wavelength dependence of the optical properties . here , we follow the more concise derivation from @xcite that is specifically dedicated to thin film treatment .",
    "furthermore , we adopt from @xcite the sign convention for the imaginary part of the index of refraction ( see fig .  [",
    "f : indexesw ] ) .",
    "although our pmt has only one layer of thin - film photocathode , we will for the sake of clarity derive fresnel equations for a stack of @xmath33 thin - film surfaces with corresponding thicknesses @xmath34 and indexes of reflection @xmath35 .",
    "the indexes @xmath35 vary with different wavelengths but in the expressions below we do not explicitly notate the dependence on @xmath31 for the sake of clarity .",
    "this stack of thin films is on the in - going and out - going side surrounded by two semi - infinite substrates with indexes @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the angles of refraction in the consequent layers can all be obtained from the incidence angle @xmath38 from snell s law this expression should be used for all @xmath33 layers @xmath39 even when it produces a complex cosine both in case of a complex index @xmath35 or a total internal reflection @xmath40 .",

    "the equations above have to be considered for two polarization cases . using the convention where p - polarization implies a magnetic field component parallel to the interface boundary ( tm wave ) and s - polarization implies a parallel electric component ( te wave ) , two variants of the admittance emerge , where @xmath51 is again obtained from eq .  .",

    ", @xmath56 , and @xmath57 which , as before , satisfy @xmath47 .",
    "cherenkov light from the injected muon is polarized perpendicularly to the emission cone . the rotational symmetry around the muon track and the fact that after several reflections on the inner walls the photon polarization is after @xmath58{ns}$ ] completely randomized , enable us to use the above polarization - averaged expressions for reflectance , transmittance , and absorptance .     and the reflectivity @xmath25 of the container walls .",

    ", they consequently convert the measured current into a released photoelectron flux @xmath64 .",
    "their definition of pmt quantum efficiency is then @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the incident photon flux from the absolutely calibrated beam .",

    "this properly accounts for the increase in photon collecting due to the reflections on mirrored surfaces and inner structure of the pmt , and gives the average value of the conversion factor .",
