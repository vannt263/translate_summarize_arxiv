    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are fast - spinning neutron stars with rotation periods ( @xmath2 ) from a few to tens of milliseconds .",
    "they are believed to be old pulsars spun up through accretion process from a companion star .",
    "msps generally show small spin - down rates ( ) that imply low surface magnetic fields ( @xmath3 ) of the order of @xmath4 g , much lower than those of young pulsars .",
    "nonetheless , msps exhibit broadband emission as young pulsars do , and are detected across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to x - ray to gamma - ray bands .",
    "recently there has been significant progress in the high - energy studies of msps .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ has detected over 60 msps in gamma - rays since 2008 ( see the lat second pulsar catalog ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and the _ xmm - newton _ mission have provided sensitive measurements of the x - ray properties of over a dozen msps ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these have significantly expanded the sample and allowed detailed studies of the population .    in this study",
    "we focus on the x - ray and gamma - ray emission properties of , which is a representative of an emerging class of msps that shows aligned pulse profiles in different energy bands @xcite .",
    "this could possibly indicate a different emission mechanism than that of typical pulsars .",
    "psr b1937 + 21  ( also known as psr j1939 + 2134 ) is the first msp discovered @xcite and it remains the second fastest - spinning pulsar known , with @xmath5ms and @xmath6 .",
    "( corrections of  due to proper motion and differential galactic rotation are negligible ) .",
    "these timing parameters suggest @xmath7 g and spin - down power @xmath8ergs@xmath9 , where @xmath10g@xmath11 is neutron star moment of inertia .",
    "this is the second largest  among msps , only after psr b1821@xmath1224 .    at high energies ,",
    "psr b1937 + 21  was first detected in x - rays with _ asca _",
    "the emission has a non - thermal spectrum and exhibits strong pulsations .",
    "the pulse profile shows a narrow peak structure with a pulsed fraction ( pf ) of 44% .",
    "the study also suggests a hint of a second peak in the profile .",
    "subsequent observations with _",
    "rxte _ and _ bepposax _ confirmed the second peak @xcite , and it was claimed that the relative strength of the two peaks and the pf could vary with energy , from pf@xmath13% in 1.310kev to pf@xmath14% in 410kev @xcite . @xcite reported on a _ chandra _  observation of the source and found an x - ray photon index @xmath15 . using 1.5yr of _ fermi _  survey data , @xcite detected gamma - ray pulsations from psr b1937 + 21 .",
    "the pulse profile well aligns with the radio profile , indicating that both emission could originate from the same region in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "spectral analysis using the _ fermi _  data suggests that the phase - averaged pulsar spectrum could be fitted with an exponentially cutoff power - law model @xcite .",
    "however , note that the spectral parameters of this source are not listed in the lat second pulsar catalog that uses three years of data , due to low detection significance with a test - statistic ( ts ) value of 10 only @xcite .",

    "the authors proposed that the radio emission could be generated in caustics in the outer magnetosphere , same as the gamma - ray emission .",
    "as table  [ table : fermimsp ] indicates , the phase alignment is typical among the highest-@xmath128  msps .",
    "we discuss below possible emission mechanisms in different energy bands , with a focus on their connection with @xmath128 .",
    "we qualitatively compare our toy model with the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of three msps  psrs b1937 + 21 , b1821@xmath1224 , and j0218 + 4232 , which have been detected in both x - rays and gamma - rays .",
    "we briefly summarize the gamma - ray emission mechanism in the context of the outer gap model @xcite , in which electrons and positrons are accelerated up to a lorentz factor of @xmath136 near the light cylinder .",
    "for a more detailed calculation of the gamma - ray emission process , we refer to @xcite and @xcite . in the outer gap ,",
    "electrons and positrons are accelerated by the electric field along the magnetic field lines and emit gev gamma - rays via the curvature radiation process .",
    "the magnitude of the electric field is given by @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the curvature radius and @xmath139 is the ratio between the gap thickness and the light cylinder radius , typically @xmath140 for msps @xcite .",
    "the lorentz factor of the accelerated particles can be estimated by the balance between the electric force and the back reaction force of the curvature radiation , @xmath141 the energy of the curvature photons is of the order of gev , @xmath142 and the gamma - ray luminosity from the outer gap is typically @xmath143      in the standard pulsar theory , non - thermal x - ray emission is attributed to synchrotron radiation from secondary pairs in the outer magnetosphere , which are generated via the pair - creation process between gamma - rays and the background x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary pairs have an initial lorentz factor of @xmath144 , then quickly lose their energy via synchrotron radiation and eventually leave the light cylinder with @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the pitch angle . during this process",
    ", synchrotron cooling gives non - thermal x - rays with @xmath147 between @xmath148kev to @xmath149kev .",
    "this is the general case for young pulsars ; they have @xmath112 observed in the range of 1.52 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for high-@xmath128  msps",
    ", while non - thermal x - rays can be produced near the light cylinder , the very hard photon indices ( @xmath150 ) are difficult to explain .",
    "a hard spectrum is expected below @xmath151 , but this is outside the observation bands .",
    "@xcite proposed that the primary particles in msps could maintain large momenta and undergo cyclotron resonant absorption of radio emission to produce synchrotron x - rays with a very hard spectrum .",
    "however , this process is not efficient between particles with @xmath152 and radio waves of 0.11ghz , unless the @xmath153-field is of the order of @xmath154@xmath4 g .",
    "such a condition can only occur near the neutron star surface .",
    "one possible scenario to explain the non - thermal x - rays from the outer magnetosphere is inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering between the primary particles and radio waves .",
    "as we discussed , the radio , x - ray , and gamma - ray emission regions of high-@xmath128  msps are likely co - located .",
    "therefore , the radio waves emitted in the outer magnetosphere may possibly irradiate the outer gap region and be up - scattered by the ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "we can estimate the energy density of the radio waves in the magnetosphere from the flux density . assuming a radio spectral index of @xmath155 , the typical energy density of @xmath23100mhz radio waves is @xmath156@xmath157erg@xmath158 in high-@xmath128  msps .",
    "the radiation power of ic scattering from a single particle is then @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the thomson cross section . as a comparison ,",
    "the power of the curvature radiation is @xmath161 .",
    "hence , @xmath162 this suggests that the expected energy flux from the ic process is only slightly smaller than that of the gev emission and it could be observable in high-@xmath128  msps .    to model the ic spectrum",
    ", we consider the scattering between outgoing particles in the outer gap and outwardly propagating radio waves .",
    "we assume that the radio emission region lies just above the outer gap and approximate the magnetic field lines by concentric circles .",
    "the collision angle between the primary particles and radio waves can be crudely estimated by @xmath163 .",
    "for each particle , the ic power per unit energy per unit solid angle is given by @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the differential klein - nishina cross section , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 is the angle between the particle motion and the scattered photon direction , and @xmath169 is the radio spectrum .",
    "the ic spectrum depends sensitively on the radio spectrum .",
    "although the latter is not very clear at low radio frequency @xmath170ghz , it is believed that a spectral turnover should exist below 100mhz for msps ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is lower than that of young pulsars ( @xmath171ghz ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a turnover at 10100mhz , the corresponding break in the ic spectrum would be at @xmath172mev .",
    "this is well above the _ chandra _  and _ xmm _  energy bands , suggesting that the ic emission could contributed to the observed x - rays . to compare with observations ,",
    "we assume a broken power - law spectrum in radio with a turnover at 10mhz , i.e. @xmath173    the spectral index @xmath174 is inferred from the observed flux densities at 400mhz and 1.4ghz listed in the atnf pulsar catalog @xcite . the index below 10mhz , @xmath175 ,",
    "is taken to be 0.5 , which provides a good match to the x - ray spectra ( see below ) .",
    "the normalization @xmath176 is related to the observed flux density at 400mhz ( @xmath177 ) and the source distance @xmath178 by @xmath179 as the exact geometry of the radio emission region is unknown , we allowed @xmath176 to vary by a factor of a few to fit the observed seds .",
    "we also considered synchrotron x - rays contributed by the secondary pairs .",
    "the particles accelerated towards the star would eventually reach the stellar surface and heat up the polar cap region .",
    "@xcite estimated a surface temperature of @xmath180mk and a luminosity of @xmath181ergs@xmath9for the thermal emission of psr  b1937 + 21 .",
    "these values are below our detection limit of 1.5mk",
    ". the thermal x - rays may collide with the gev gamma - rays to create new pairs , which emit non - thermal x - rays via the synchrotron process .",
    "the optical depth of the pair - creation process is @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath184 .",
    "the energy distribution of the secondary pairs follows @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the lorentz factor of the secondary pairs , @xmath187 , @xmath188 is the curvature radiation power per unit energy , and @xmath189 is the rate of energy loss from synchrotron radiation . with @xmath190 , equation  ( [ sdist ] ) describes a power - law with index @xmath191 .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum from secondary pairs is @xmath192 where @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sed ] we compare our simple model with the observed seds of psrs b1937 + 21 , b1821@xmath1224 , and j0218 + 4232 .",
    "it shows that our model provides reasonable fits to the data .",
    "the peak flux of the ic and curvature radiation are similar and the ic emission dominates over the synchrotron radiation in the x - ray band above a few kev . since the ic spectrum is sensitive to the radio spectral index , low - frequency radio measurements below 100mhz in future can offer essential inputs to refine the modeling . for the assumed spectral turnover at 10mhz , the ic emission peaks at @xmath23100kev , which could be detectable with hard x - ray telescopes such as _ nustar _ or _ astro - h_.      the radio emission process in pulsars is not clearly understood ,",
    "nonetheless , it has been suggested that plasma instability could play an important role in the generation of the coherent radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the characteristic timescale for the instabilities ( e.g. , two - stream instability ) to develop is related to the inverse of the plasma frequency @xmath196 .",
    "the electron and positron number density , @xmath197 , is proportional to the goldreich - julian charge density ( @xmath198 ) such that @xmath199",
    ". therefore , high-@xmath128  msps tend to have a higher plasma frequency , and hence a shorter instability timescale , in the outer magnetosphere .    above the outer gap accelerator ,",
    "the outgoing and incoming gamma - rays produce electron - positron pairs moving towards the light cylinder and the star , respectively .",
    "these flows could develop two - stream instability in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "since there are more pairs created near the inner boundary than near the outer boundary of the outer gap @xcite , the outflow is stronger than the inflow at the light cylinder .",
    "the lorentz factor of the two flows are of the order of @xmath200 , for which the synchrotron cooling timescale is comparable to light - crossing time of the magnetosphere .",
    "the instability development timescale can be estimated by @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 are the number densities of the outgoing and incoming flows , respectively , and @xmath204 is the plasma frequency of the outgoing flow @xcite . with a typical multiplicity of the order of @xmath205 , we may assume @xmath206 and @xmath207 in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "hence , the timescale becomes @xmath208 which is much shorter than the light - crossing time of @xmath209s . as a result",
    ", the instability could develop before the outgoing particles escape the magnetosphere .",
    "we speculate that the two - stream instability may generate non - homogeneous and separated plasma clouds , and the scattering or emission process of the plasma cloud eventually produce the observed radio emission in phase with the gamma - ray pulses .    finally , we note that some high-@xmath128  msps , e.g. , psrs b1821@xmath1224 and j1810 + 1744 , show complex radio profiles with additional components that offset from the gamma - ray peaks",
    ". these could be contributed by emission from the polar cap region as in the conventional theory of pulsar radio emission .",
    "we have analyzed x - ray and gamma - ray observations of psr b1937 + 21  taken with _",
    "chandra _ ,",
    "_ xmm _  and _ fermi _  lat .",
    "we obtained much improved spectral and timing measurements than previous studies .",
    "our results show that the pulsar x - ray emission is @xmath23100% pulsed and has a purely non - thermal spectrum that can be described by a hard power - law of photon index @xmath210 .",
    "the x - ray pulse profile consists of two sharp peaks @xmath23180  apart .",
    "they generally align with the radio peaks and the phase offsets are less than 7% of the spin period . in gamma - rays , the 5.5yr of _",
    "fermi _  survey data provide a good quality pulse profile in 0.1100gev with a significance of over 7@xmath33 .",
    "we performed a binned likelihood analysis on the pulsed emission and found that a simple power - law model with @xmath108 gives a ts value of 112 , corresponding to over 10@xmath33 significance . adding an exponential cutoff to the power - law model",
    "slightly improves the fit , but the change is not statistically significant .",
    "a comparison of psr b1937 + 21  with other msps indicates that sources with a strong magnetic field at the light cylinder tend to show a hard , non - thermal x - ray spectrum and good alignment of pulse profiles in different energy bands .",
    "the latter suggests that the radio , x - ray , and gamma - ray emission could originate from the same region in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "we speculate that radio emission could be generated in the outer gap region when @xmath128  is large , since this could give rise to short instability time scales .",
    "we investigate a simple model in which the non - thermal x - rays are contributed by ic scattering between radio waves and primary particles in the outer magnetosphere and by synchrotron radiation from secondary particles .",
    "we showed that this toy model is capable to qualitatively reproduce the observed seds of the highest-@xmath128msps .",
