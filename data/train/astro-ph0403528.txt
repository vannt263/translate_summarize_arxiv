    "this scale is intriguing as the relic density of a stable particle with this mass and corresponding cross section turns out to be of order the critical density , as we observe the matter density to be today .",

    "charged particles suffer complicated motions in the galactic magnetic field , and furthermore they lose energy to synchrotron and inverse compton processes .",
    "searching for the synchrotron emission from the galactic center @xcite and from galactic satellites @xcite has been discussed previously , though neglecting the diffusion of the charged particles .",
    "we will show that the inverse compton emission , extended over a large area from the charged particle annihilation products may be observable for some models of particle dark matter and of galactic satellites .",
    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the lightest of the superpartners ( lsp ) is often the lightest neutralino .",
    "the latter is a superposition of the superpartners of the neutral gauge and higgs bosons , @xmath2 with r - parity conserved , this lightest superpartner is stable . for significant regions of the mssm parameter space ,",
    "the relic density of the stable neutralino is of the order @xmath3 , thus constituting an important ( and perhaps exclusive ) part of the cold dark matter .",

    "the only detailed information about models we require for this study ( apart from the relic density constraint ) is the annihilation cross section at non - relativistic velocities @xmath17 ( accounting for the factor of two due to identical particles in the initial state ) and the spectrum of annihilation products , in particular the photons , electrons and positrons .",
    "the photons are primarily from the @xmath0 decays associated with hadronic final states , whereas the leptons can be from the associated @xmath1 decays , or more directly from massive gauge boson decays . in fig .",
    "[ fig : inputspec ] we illustrate two models in the generic mssm , one with a typical featureless spectrum of annihilation products , and the other clearly exhibiting the feature from @xmath18 decays .",
    "the calculation of the diffuse emission from the annihilations proceeds in several steps .",
    "first , the time dependent density of charged particles is determined according to a diffusion model .",
    "the charged particles are trapped by the galactic magnetic field , which extends for several kpc from the stellar disk . here",
    "we stress that we are concerned only with those galactic satellites that are currently ( or in the recent past ) within this `` diffusion zone '' . a time dependent treatment is necessary because a satellite moving with the typical galactic velocity of 300 km s@xmath7 crosses the diffusion zone in roughly one diffusion time : both timescales are of order tens of millions of years .",
    "the second step in the calculation is to calculate the column density of particles along various lines of sight , as a function of particle energy .",
    "lastly , the inverse compton and synchrotron spectra can be calculated from the particle spectrum under some assumptions about the galactic magnetic field and radiation fields .",
    "the propagation of charged particles in the tangled galactic magnetic field can be modeled as diffusion .",
    "electrons and positrons lose energy rapidly to synchrotron radiation , and also to inverse compton scattering on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and on starlight .",
    "we will use the diffusion model of ref .",
    "more sophisticated models are available , e.g.  the semianalytic treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite and the fully numerical galprop model @xcite , but our model is simple to implement , yielding quantitatively similar results , and affords an intuitive understanding .",
    "we will make the assumption that the charged particle velocity distribution is locally isotropic , namely that the particles `` stick '' to the galactic magnetic field , and that the velocity distribution contains no record of the initial conditions .",
    "this is important as we consider sources ( satellite halos ) that move a significant distance in a diffusion time .",
    "if the velocity distribution was isotropic in the satellite frame ( as could be the case if the satellite had a significant magnetic field of its own ) , our results would be different .",
    "the time dependent diffusion  loss equation in homogeneous space for the density of charged particles as a function of energy @xmath19 is the following , @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] is the energy dependent diffusion constant , with @xmath22 @xmath23 s@xmath7 and @xmath24 .",

    "this scale indicates that particles travel only a few kpc before losing most of their energy ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the galactic magnetic field has a limited extent , which can be modeled simply by defining a diffusion zone at the boundary of which particles freely escape .",

    "many authors have discussed the distribution of substructure in galactic halos .",
    "there are two important issues relating to the detectability of annihilations in these structures , both their mass distribution and their density profile .",
    "again we stress that we are interested only in those satellites within the diffusion zone .",
    "as the diffusion zone is fairly extended , there should be a significant number of such satellites : even out to a radius of 30 kpc , the diffusion zone is roughly 15% of the total volume of the galactic halo .",

    "the moore profile has a logarithmically diverging flux , but the enhancement factor is less than 40 if annihilations empty the central cusp , and much less than that for other mechanisms . for example , if interactions with a central black hole sweep out the central region ( of order 1 pc ) , the enhancement is less than 10",
    ". this may be the case for the full galactic halo , but for dark clumps without stars , there may be no central black hole .",
    "steeper profiles can in principle have much larger enhancement factors , though with a cutoff of 1 pc , the enhancement is less than of order 1000 even for @xmath139 . in the next section , we will see that annihilation rates of order @xmath140 are needed for point sources to be confidently seen in diffuse emission , thus @xmath141 is probably required . coincidentally , steeper profiles look more like point sources , so clumps with high enough annihilation rates will be easy to model from this perspective . however , the nfw profile is not too far from detectability for a 10@xmath142 clump , if the annihilation cross section is the maximum allowed .",
    "some clumping of the halo might tip the balance and make even this profile a candidate for detection in inverse compton emission .",
    "here we note that the effect that clumpiness in galactic halos has on dark matter detection has been discussed at length , e.g.  ref.@xcite .",
    "the egret gamma ray survey discovered a large number of point sources , a large fraction of which remain unidentified @xcite .",
    "these sources typically have fluxes of order @xmath143 we investigate the possibility that some of these might be milky way satellites undergoing annihilations at their centers .",
    "the annihilation scenario requires that there is no other concentrated emission than the gamma rays .",
    "other astrophysical sources of just about any type are expected to have emission at other wavelengths as well .",
    "these sources ( identified or not ) are not measured below about 100 mev , thus the turnover expected for @xmath0 photons at @xmath144 mev could not have been observed .",
    "however , the spectrum of an annihilation source should be closer to flat around 100 mev , as seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : inputspec ] , thus the egret point sources are typically not very good candidates for annihilation radiation . however , they do set the scale of possible annihilation sources quite well .",
    "the yield of gamma rays predominantly from @xmath0 decays in the hadronization of annihilation products is typically @xmath145 annihilation@xmath7 at energies of @xmath146 gev .",
    "this means the inferred rate of annihilations for these sources is @xmath147 @xmath148 s@xmath7 . for a clump at a distance of 8 kpc ,",
    "the inferred annihilation rate is @xmath149 s@xmath7 .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , this rate likely requires a central density cusp at least as steep as @xmath150 .",
    "we ask the following question : can glast confirm or rule out the hypothesis that some of the unidentified egret point sources are the annihilating cores of very steep profile dark matter subhalos ?",
    "we argue that the answer is yes , for two reasons .",
    "first , glast will have improved performance an energies below 100 mev , down to a threshold of 20 mev .",
    "certainly , the turnover in spectrum at about 70 mev that should be present in an annihilation source should be visible .",
    "second , the diffuse inverse compton emission associated with a few times 10@xmath151 annihilations per second , covering hundreds of square degrees , should yield both a significant fraction of the background and a statistically significant detection .",
    "glast will have an enormously improved exposure over egret : at 1 gev and above , the expectation is @xmath152 @xmath23 s to any point on the sky , per year @xcite . in fig .",

    "the signal / background column represents the total number of photons , inside the 68% containment region , compared with the extragalactic background . for a convincing detection ,",
    "we require that the signal be an appreciable fraction of the background , as the anisotropies in the background are in principle considerable .",
    "we of course also require a significant signal to noise ratio .",
    "lastly , we require a significant total number of photons .",
    "based on these rough criteria , the detectability of the diffuse emission by egret seems marginal , though glast should be able to detect it easily .",

    "if the galactic center region were better understood , it might be possible to uncover such a signature .",
    "we have calculated the spectrum and spatial extent of diffuse emission from the charged particle products of dark matter annihilations .",

    "we have shown that at least in terms of the number of photons , the diffuse inverse compton emission might be detectable by glast , assuming bright enough annihilation sources .",
    "the spatial extent of the emission makes its detection problematic of course .",
    "glast will certainly detect a significant number of point sources in a region of this size . in a future work we will study in detail the feasibility of separating these signals .    as mentioned previously , these results are fairly generic , and do not depend strongly on the particle physics model .",
    "as we are concerned with the electrons and positrons , we do not even require that the dark matter have hadronic interactions .",
    "leptonically interacting dark matter @xcite would still provide photons and electrons , albeit by different processes and with different spectra .",
