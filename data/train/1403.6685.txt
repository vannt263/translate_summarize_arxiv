    "quantum well models are important for the design of semiconductor devices , such as the quantum well infrared photodetector ( qwip ) which is used for infrared imaging applications ; see schneider and liu @xcite for an overview .",
    "the qwip relies upon a quantum well which has been sized so that the energy of an electron in the first excited state is quite near the threshold of confinement in the well .",
    "the qwip is therefore very sensitive to the arrival of a single photon .",
    "there are many other uses of quantum well models in nanostructures ; the textbook by harrison @xcite is a good survey of the field .",
    "the one - dimensional quantum finite square well ( fsw ) model is a familiar topic in most introductory quantum mechanics books ; see for instance bransden and joachain @xcite , section 4.6 . after deriving a pair of equations to describe the bound energy levels within the well ,",
    "the solution is carried out by graphical or computational methods .",
    "it is sometimes said that the fsw problem does not have an exact solution , but there are in fact exact solutions as presented in the papers of burniston and siewert @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "those exact methods generally rely upon contour integration in the complex plane .    we have found a simple geometric method which can be used to describe the solutions of the one - dimensional finite square well problem .",
    "our approach is analytic , using complex variables , but does not rely upon contour integration as such .",
    "we instead make a strong appeal to geometric imagination .",
    "we focus on the description of the solution set via conformal mapping of simple geometric shapes ( lines and circles ) between two complex domains , using the mapping given by @xmath1 .",
    "thus our solution might be described as  geometric - analytic \" .    in the rest of this introductory section",
    "we will describe the motivation of this note . in section [ sect - solution ]",
    "we will show the mathematical details of the fsw solution .",
    "that solution will be presented at a gradual pace , to introduce the technique and so that it may also be used for teaching if desired .",
    "* motivation *    when solving the one - dimensional fsw problem , after some initial definitions and discussion , a textbook will arrive at the task of finding solutions to one of the two equations @xmath2 or @xmath3 together with the constraint @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive reals which are related to the allowed bound energy levels which are to be found .",
    "@xmath7 is a unitless parameter of the problem which is determined only by the dimensions of the potential well  that is , its ( spatial ) width and ( potential ) depth  and independent of the energy level of the bound state .",
    "bransden and joachain call the parameter @xmath7 the  strength parameter \" of the problem , and we will also use that terminology .    one is often shown graphical solutions of the pair of simultaneous equations ( [ equtanv ] ) and ( [ equ2v2 ] ) , or of the pair ( [ equcotv ] ) and ( [ equ2v2 ] ) , and is encouraged to use a computer to find numerical solutions . the allowable energy levels for the bound particle are then calculated from the values of @xmath5 or @xmath6 .    in this note , we will show that the solutions of the fsw problem can be described using the lambert w function @xcite . this alternative solution may provide some insight into the fsw problem . sometimes having a solution determined by an analytic function , instead of graphically or numerically , can make it easier to use that solution in subsequent work  for instance , if it is desirable to determine the sensitivity of the solution to changes in a parameter .",
    "in contrast to the contour integral methods , our geometric - analytic method is quite simple to describe .",
    "the only concept which may cause a student some concern will be the use of the lambert w function , and we have tried to motivate that in context .",
    "it may be that the student will find this solution of a practical problem ,",
    "the quantum square well , provides a comprehensible introduction to the lambert w function as one of the family of special functions which are useful not only for quantum problems but for an immense variety of problems in diverse fields .",
    "this presentation of the solution of the finite square well ( fsw ) problem will move fairly rapidly through the parts of the solution process which are familiar from standard textbooks , and more gradually through the novel parts of the solution .",
    "we will write the solution in terms of complex variables as long as feasible , rather than introducing real and imaginary components too early .",
    "suppose a bound particle in a 1-dimensional finite square well potential @xmath8 , which is given by @xmath9 for @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and by @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive reals , @xmath14 being ( half ) the width of the well , and @xmath15 being the depth .",
    "the particle has energy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a positive real between 0 and @xmath15 .",
    "the particle s wave function @xmath18 satisfies the time - independent schrdinger equation ( tise ) , @xmath19 there are three regions : region 1 is @xmath10 , with wave function @xmath20 ; region 2 is @xmath13 , with wave function @xmath21 ; region 3 is @xmath11 , with wave function @xmath22 .    in region 2 ,",
    "the tise becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 and the wave function satisfies the equation @xmath25 for some complex constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 , to be determined .",
    "the value of @xmath28 is real , and we can take it to be positive .    in regions 1 and 3 , the tise becomes @xmath29 where @xmath30 the value of @xmath31 can be taken to be positive real .",
    "the wave function satisfies the equation @xmath32 in region 1 , and the equation @xmath33 in region 3 , for some complex constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 , to be determined .",
    "the continuity constraints can be expressed as four equations : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39    form linear combinations of these equations as follows : @xmath40 times equation ( [ eqcvpa ] ) plus or minus equation ( [ eqcdpa ] ) , and @xmath40 times equation ( [ eqcvna ] ) plus or minus equation ( [ eqcdna ] ) .",
    "conceptually , those manipulations correspond to factoring @xmath41 and requiring that one of the right - hand factors be zero , when evaluated at each of the points @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we obtain four new equations : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47    one way to proceed is to divide equation ( [ eqbc ] ) by equation ( [ eqad ] ) , and realize that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are equal .",
    "let @xmath50 denote @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , dividing equation ( [ eqac ] ) by equation ( [ eqbd ] ) shows that @xmath51 also equals @xmath49 .",
    "hence @xmath50 equals @xmath52 , which leads to two cases : @xmath50 is either 1 or -1 .",
    "that corresponds to the conclusion , in the textbook solution , that @xmath53 must be either an even function or an odd function . if @xmath50 is 1 ,",
    "then @xmath54 which is the even function @xmath55 times a complex constant @xmath56 , whose phase may be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "if @xmath50 is -1 , then @xmath57 which is the odd function @xmath58 times a complex constant @xmath59 , whose phase may be chosen arbitrarily .    in the solution of bransden and joachain @xcite , section 4.6 , which works with real values and hence trigonometric functions ,",
    "that dichotomy eventually results in the two distinct equations ( [ equtanv ] ) and ( [ equcotv ] ) . here , we continue with a complex valued approach to the fsw problem to get the insights that brings .",
    "so we will simply for the time being let @xmath50 denote a value which , in the solution , will be either 1 or -1 .",
    "that is , @xmath50 represents either of the two square roots of unity .    the four equations ( [ eqbc ] ) thru ( [ eqad ] ) reduce to two equations : @xmath60 @xmath61 dividing equation ( [ eqac1 ] ) by ( [ eqac2 ] ) gives ( since @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) @xmath64    introduce variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 to express ( [ eqeps1 ] ) as @xmath67 the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are related to the energy @xmath17 via @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , so if we know @xmath5 or @xmath6 , then the energy @xmath17 can be determined .",
    "moreover , @xmath70 , say . the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 lie on an @xmath7-circle . here",
    "@xmath7 does not depend upon the energy , but is a parameter of the fsw problem , depending only on the ( spatial ) width and ( energy ) depth of the potential well .",
    "bransden and joachain call @xmath7 the  strength parameter \" .",
    "@xmath7 is unitless , and as will be seen , the number of solutions of the fsw problem will increase as the value of @xmath7 gets larger",
    ".    equation ( [ eqeps2 ] ) thus simplifies to @xmath71    now we wish to introduce the lambert w function . some references to lambert w properties and applications are @xcite . for the present purpose",
    ", it suffices to know that lambert @xmath72 is the analytic multi - branch solution of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the complex argument of @xmath72 .",
    "that is , if we can manipulate an equation into the form @xmath75 , then the solution will be one or all of the branches of @xmath76 .    comparing the lambert function with the natural logarithm function @xmath77",
    ", we observe that they are closely related ; @xmath78 is the multi - branch analytic function which solves the equation @xmath79 .",
    "the natural logarithm is very familiar , and it has many useful properties .",
    "lambert w is similarly useful , once one learns to recognize problem situations where it has application .",
    "take the square root of equation ( [ eqeps3 ] ) , to obtain @xmath80 here we have let @xmath81 represent the square root of @xmath50 , as well as a @xmath82 factor which comes from taking the square root of @xmath83 .",
    "that is , there are four alternatives ; @xmath81 may be any of @xmath82 or @xmath84 . letting @xmath81 represent",
    "an arbitrary member of that set of four alternatives is convenient , since for instance the conjugate , reciprocal or negative of the symbol @xmath81 is just @xmath81 , that is , another representative of that set of four alternatives .",
    "so we may take the conjugate in equation ( [ eqeps4 ] ) , replace the conjugate @xmath85 by @xmath81 ( since @xmath81 represents any one of the four complex roots of unity ) , and transfer the exponential to the left hand side , to obtain a simpler - looking equation @xmath86    at this point we could , if we wished , replace @xmath87 by @xmath88 , and obtain @xmath89 suppose for instance that @xmath90 .",
    "taking the imaginary part of equation ( [ eqgam2 ] ) gives @xmath91 that equation ( [ eqimag1 ] ) is simply @xmath92 which , together with the constraint that @xmath5 and @xmath6 lie on the circle of radius @xmath7 , is the textbook version of the fsw solution .",
    "however , we would like to keep the solution process general for a bit longer .    we are almost there .",
    "consider the geometric content of equation ( [ eqgam1 ] ) .",
    "write @xmath93 , which , since we have chosen @xmath5 and @xmath6 to be positive , lies in the first quadrant .",
    "further , we know that the magnitude of @xmath94 is @xmath7 , since @xmath95 . the effect of the factor @xmath96 in equation ( [ eqgam1 ] ) is to rotate @xmath94 counterclockwise by an angle of at most @xmath7 radians , so that the product @xmath97 can lie in any quadrant .",
    "however , the condition that @xmath97 equal @xmath81 ( one of the four fourth roots of unity ) times the real number @xmath7 , means that only certain rotational angles @xmath6 are allowable as solutions of equation ( [ eqgam1 ] ) .",
    "the point @xmath98 can not lie  within \" a quadrant ; it must lie on either the real or the imaginary axis .",
    "that of course is the resonance phenomenon which is familiar with regard to stabilizing the values of quantum mechanical observables .",
    "now , can we relate this to the lambert w function ?",
    "suppose we consider the real and imaginary parts of the expression @xmath99 where @xmath93 .",
    "we have @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102    imagine the mappings between the @xmath74-plane and the @xmath94-plane .",
    "the map @xmath103 carries the @xmath94-plane to the @xmath74-plane , and the inverse map ( multi - branch ) is the lambert w function , carrying the @xmath74-plane to the @xmath94-plane .",
    "the two rays from the origin in the @xmath74-plane along the imaginary axis , are the values of @xmath104 when @xmath105 and @xmath106 is a positive real .",
    "those rays in the @xmath74-plane correspond to the @xmath94-plane values for which @xmath107 which is equivalent to the equation @xmath108    similarly , the two rays from the origin in the @xmath74-plane along the real axis , are the values of @xmath104 when @xmath109 and @xmath106 is a positive real .",
    "those rays in the @xmath74-plane corresponds to the @xmath94-values for which @xmath110 which is equivalent to the equation @xmath111    finally , the @xmath7-circle in the @xmath94-plane , under the mapping @xmath103 , has its image as a closed ( multi - loop self - intersecting ) curve in the @xmath74-plane .",
    "those set correspondences show how to visualize the solution of the fsw problem in terms of the lambert w function .",
    "there are two alternative approaches :    \\(a ) start with the axes ( both real and imaginary ) of the @xmath74-plane excluding the point at the origin .",
    "let s call those two axes the sets @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and let their union be @xmath114 .",
    "that is , the set @xmath115 is four axial rays from the origin in the @xmath74-plane .",
    "map the axial rays to the @xmath94-plane via the multi - branch lambert w function , obtaining the set @xmath116 as a family of lines in the @xmath94-plane  one line for each combination of an axial ray and a branch of the lambert w function .",
    "intersect that set @xmath117 , in the @xmath94-plane , with the circle @xmath118 .",
    "that is the solution set of the fsw problem . + or    \\(b ) start with the circle @xmath118 in the @xmath94-plane , let s call it @xmath119 .",
    "map that circle to the @xmath74-plane via @xmath103 , to obtain a set , let s say @xmath120 in the @xmath74-plane . in a set - wise notation , we might write @xmath121 . intersect that set with the axes @xmath112 and @xmath113 in the @xmath74-plane .",
    "that also is the solution of the fsw problem , with the solution set represented in the @xmath74-plane .",
    "it is useful to see these two approaches in graphical form .",
    "solution in w - plane . @xmath122ray@xmath123 means branch @xmath124 image of axial ray . ]    as an illustration , suppose that @xmath125 . we will start with approach a , and observe that it reproduces the textbook solution .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath94-plane . the circle @xmath126 is shown , along with maps of the real and imaginary axes as transformed by the lambert w function .",
    "various branches of the lambert w function have been shown , for branch numbers 1 to -1 ( using the conventional definitions of branch numbers from corless , et al @xcite ) .",
    "only the branch numbers 1 , 0 and -1 intersect the circle @xmath127 .",
    "the first quadrant of figure 1 , for @xmath128 and @xmath129 , is readily seen to be equivalent to the textbook diagram , with the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes flipped . compare for instance figure 4.11 of bransden and joachain @xcite ; the authors , in their figure , use symbols @xmath130 for @xmath6 , @xmath131 for @xmath5 , and @xmath81 for @xmath7 .",
    "their @xmath132 curve shows the four bound state solutions , two even states and two odd states , as visible in the first quadrant of our figure 1 .",
    "now , what happens if instead we use approach b to look at the solution for the @xmath133 example , working in the @xmath74-plane ?",
    "instead of the circle @xmath134 in the @xmath94-plane we have its transform @xmath120 under the map @xmath135 , which gives a closed curve in the @xmath74-plane , with multiple loops around the origin .",
    "we are interested in the places where that curve crosses one of the axes , since those are the possible solutions of the finite square well problem .",
    "figures 2 to 5 show that curve , the whole of the @xmath120 curve in figure 2 , with magnifications in figures 3 to 5 to exhibit the fine details .",
    "solution in @xmath74-plane . ]",
    "solution in @xmath74-plane , magnified . ]    solution in @xmath74-plane , magnified . ]",
    "solution in @xmath74-plane , magnified . ]",
    "the @xmath120 curve crosses the axes 14 times , counting multiplicities , ie crossings at the same coordinates but with different trajectories .",
    "those correspond to the 14 solutions , the circle intersections in figure 1 , of the problem visualized in the @xmath94-plane . to express those solutions in terms of the phase @xmath136 of the @xmath94 variable , write @xmath137 .",
    "then the solutions ( the phase angle @xmath136 parameter values when the curve @xmath120 crosses one of the axes ) are : x - axis crossings at @xmath138 0.000 , 0.546 , 1.377 , 2.179 , 3.142 , 4.105 , 4.906 , 5.737 , and y - axis crossings at @xmath138 0.264 , 0.875 , 2.735 , 3.548 , 5.408 , 6.019 .    to obtain the solutions in the first quadrant , that is with @xmath5 and @xmath6 required to be positive , we can simply restrict the @xmath136 phase to be between 0 and @xmath139 , and exclude the case @xmath140 as not being physical . that produces the standard textbook results .",
    "as one can see the lambert w function , considered as a mapping between two planes , provides a visualization of the solution of the finite square well problem in terms of simple geometric objects : the real and imaginary axes , and circles around the origin .",
    "the area of the circle around the origin corresponds to the dimensions of the finite square well , and is proportional to the square of the strength parameter , that is , to the depth of the well and to the square of its linear dimension ; in symbols , @xmath141 .",
    "the proportionality constant is @xmath142 , and the units of that constant cancel the units of @xmath143 , resulting in @xmath144 , and hence @xmath7 , being unitless .",
    "the lambert w description of the finite square well problem is best visualized as a conformal map between two complex planes , produced by the mapping @xmath1 , the lambert w function being the multi - branch inverse of that mapping .    the axial rays in the @xmath74-plane map to the lambert w lines in the @xmath94-plane , whose intersections with the circle of radius @xmath7 about the origin give the solutions to the fsw problem .",
    "alternatively , the circle of radius @xmath7 about the origin in the @xmath94-plane maps to a multi - loop closed curve in the @xmath74-plane , whose intersections with the axial rays also give the solutions to the fsw problem .",
    "thus one may approach the problem situation working in either the @xmath94-plane ( as is traditional ) , or in the @xmath74-plane  the choice of plane being determined by the convenience of other aspects of the particular problem which may be simpler in one or the other of those representations .",
    "this technique bears some similarities to the method used in @xcite to determine the fringing fields of a parallel plate capacitor .    because the mapping is conformal , the angles between the circle in figure 1 and the various lambert w lines are equal to the angles of the corresponding intersections in figure 2 of the multi - loop image of the circle and the axial rays .",
    "that suggests some possibilities for design of materials to be sensitive to slight changes in their environment , and leads back to the topic of the quantum well infrared photodetector ( qwip ) with which we introduced this paper .",
    "it is worth noting that the finite square well is  realistic \" despite its simplicity , and continues to find use in contemporary research .",
    "for instance , deshmukh , et al @xcite use a 3-dimensional radial finite square well model to characterize the attosecond - scale time delays of the photoionization of an atom of xenon trapped within a c60 fullerine molecule .",
    "kocabas , et al @xcite , in a study of mathematical models for metal - insulator - metal waveguides , note ( pages 13 - 14 of their paper ) that there is a close relationship between the one - dimensional schrdinger equation and the electromagnetic wave equation in layered media , and mention several ideas for investigation .",
    "they write  it is intriguing to ask whether such studies [ of fsw solutions and their relationship to changes in reflection spectra of wells ] could be useful in optics for the investigation of the effects of material interfaces \" .",
    "thus there is plenty of opportunity to do interesting work even with as old and familiar a topic as the finite square well .",
    "there is a relationship of the solutions of the finite square well to the quadratix of hippias , which is the solutions in the @xmath145 plane of the equation @xmath146 .",
    "you can flip the axes or make translations to get other similar expressions of the relationship between the two variables .",
    "see corless , et al @xcite , page 344 .    the quadratix of hippias can be used to solve various problems , such as the trisection of an arbitrary angle .",
    "harper and driskell @xcite have an enjoyable description of construction of the quadratix , using interactive software for geometric constructions , and show how to use the quadratix to multiply an angle by any factor which can be expressed as a ratio of the lengths of two straight lines .",
    "that raises the entertaining possibility that one could perhaps present quantum mechanics in the language of euclidean geometry .",
    "physics textbooks could return to the geometric methods utilized by sir isaac newton in his _ principia _ !",
    "that is a somewhat lighthearted suggestion , essentially an entertainment , but it also represents a serious alternative view  and we may gain new insights .",
    "quantum mechanics is already often described with a visual , diagrammatic language .",
    "we anticipate there may be other interesting aspects of this geometric - analytic solution technique , for future exploration .",
    "we have presented a solution of the quantum mechanics problem of the allowable energy levels of a bound particle in a 1-dimensional finite square well potential .",
    "the solution is a  geometric - analytic \" technique utilizing the lambert w function .",
    "the solutions can be represented in either of two domains , and a representation in the transformed domain has a particularly simple geometry .",
    "there are many opportunities to follow up .",
