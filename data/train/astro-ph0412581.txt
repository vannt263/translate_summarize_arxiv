    "the evidence from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) for a flat universe @xcite and a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of primordial adiabatic perturbations @xcite , in good agreement with the predictions of inflation @xcite , motivates additional observational probes of inflation .",
    "one such probe is the polarisation signature @xcite of the stochastic gravitational - wave background @xcite produced during inflation , which has now become the target of several ground - based experiments @xcite , as well as an einstein vision experiment in nasa s science roadmap @xcite .",
    "large - angle cmb temperature fluctuations from these gravitational waves ( tensor metric perturbations ) were first considered in refs . @xcite and",
    "the polarisation was first considered in ref .",
    "now , the most precise predictions for these power spectra come from numerical calculations @xcite . like the power spectra for density perturbations ( scalar metric perturbations ) , which exhibit wiggles due to acoustic waves in the primordial baryon - photon fluid , the temperature and polarisation power spectra from gravitational waves exhibit wiggles due to oscillations of tensor modes as they enter the horizon .",
    "the wiggles in the density - perturbation power spectra were predicted originally by sunyaev and zeldovich @xcite and peebles and yu @xcite , and explained later elegantly with a semi - analytic approach in a paper by hu and sugiyama @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present an analytic account of the features in the tensor power spectra .",
    "such an approach explains the origin of the features in the temperature and polarisation power spectra and illustrates the dependence of these features on the tensor power spectrum , cosmological parameters , and details of the recombination history .",
    "the intuition provided by such an approach complements the more precise results of numerical calculations . in particular , we explain here the location of the wiggles in the tensor temperature and polarisation power spectra , and why the bumps in the curl component of the polarisation are smoother than those in the curl - free component .",
    "we also show how the amplitude of the polarisation depends on the details of the recombination history .",
    "our approach is analogous to that for scalar modes given in ref .",
    "we discuss how measurement of the locations of these peaks can provide an independent probe of cosmological parameters .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : exact ] , we write the exact equations for cmb fluctuations from tensor perturbations .",
    "the exact equations consist of the evolution of the gravitational waves , the visibility function , the source function , and projection factors .",
    "next we develop a qualitative understanding of the physics contained in these relations in section [ sec : tale ] .",
    "the remainder of the paper then investigates individually each ingredient in the exact calculation .",

    "the fourth stokes parameter , @xmath3 , is not generated by thomson scattering , and while it can be generated after last scattering , the expected amplitudes are small @xcite and so can be neglected .",

    "these expressions may be inverted to obtain the spherical - harmonic expansion coefficients , @xmath15 @xmath16 rather than work in terms of @xmath17 it is advantageous to define two rotationally invariant quantities @xmath18 and @xmath19 by the relations @xmath20 @xmath21 these two quantities are equivalent to the curl and grad modes defined in ref .",

    ", we can form a series of correlation functions that characterise the statistics of the cmb perturbations .",
    "of the six possible combinations , the tb and eb cross - correlations will vanish unless parity is somehow violated in the early universe .",
    "the power spectra are defined as the rotationally - invariant quantities , @xmath23    given a formalism to describe the observed cmb perturbations , it is then necessary to calculate a theoretical description of the perturbations .",

    "the form of this power spectrum is motivated by inflationary theories which generically predict the tensor spectral index @xmath28 , a nearly scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "if the process generating the perturbations is gaussian , then this power spectrum encodes all information about the distribution .",
    "the evolution equations for the tensor modes may be derived from the einstein equations and are @xcite @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is a symmetric , traceless perturbation to the spatial part of the metric , and @xmath31 is the tensor part of the anisotropic stress . here and throughout , overdots denote derivatives with respect to conformal time , and @xmath32 is the scale factor normalised to unity today .",
    "the temperature and polarisation anisotropies induced by an equal mixture of tensor modes of @xmath33 and @xmath34 polarisation with amplitude @xmath35 may be described in terms of the variables @xmath36 , where x=(t , e , b ) .",

    "first let us discuss the temperature power spectrum .",
    "the temperature multipole moments due to an individual gravitational - wave of wavenumber @xmath26 observed at a conformal time @xmath51 are @xmath71 with @xmath61 .",
    "the second of the sourcing terms is localised to the surface of last scattering ( sls ) by the visibility function ; as a consequence of the restricted range this term is small and may be neglected at all angular scales . between @xmath72 and @xmath73 ,",
    "the contribution from the @xmath74 term falls off more slowly than the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) term allowing it to become marginally relevant . at lower and higher @xmath56 ,",
    "the power generated by the second term dies off rapidly and is totally negligible ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sourcecomp ] ) . the first term , which dominates this integral , involves an integral from the sls to the present day .",
    "its form tells us that the temperature power spectrum is sensitive to the evolution of gravitational waves from the sls to today and not to the recombination history .",
    "this term is a form of integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect that describes the anisotropy generated by changing gravitational potentials .",
    "term only ( dashed line ) .",
    "the @xmath74 term is essentially negligible at all @xmath56 .",
    "the normalisation here , and in all plots , is specified by setting @xmath75 and @xmath76 . ]",
    "we can understand this effect by recalling that a gravitational - wave alternately stretches and compresses space as it oscillates . a photon travelling past the gravitational - wave loses energy when its wavelength is stretched , but gains energy when its wavelength is reduced .",
    "if the gravitational - wave amplitude evolves over the course of the oscillation , the photon will undergo a net change in energy .",
    "tensor modes decrease steadily in amplitude and oscillate after horizon entry . as such",
    ", a photon travelling along the crest of a phase front will slowly gain energy as the overall amplitude of the gravitational - wave decreases .",
    "photons travelling at an angle to the mode experience further red and blue shifting as they propagate through different phase regions .",
    "their energy oscillates as a consequence . between the sls and today , the period - averaged amplitude of the tensor mode decreases , and",
    "so the mean energy of the photon increases .",
    "if we consider a late time , so that the amplitude of the tensor modes is essentially zero , then we see that the final energy of the photon is determined by whether it started its journey from the sls at a trough or crest in the tensor mode .",
    "photons starting at a crest will have gained more energy and appear hotter than average and vice versa for those starting at a trough .",
    "this simplistic picture is modified by the effect of power free - streaming from one angular scale to another as the universe expands , which tends to smooth the resultant power spectra .",
    "the situation is very different for the polarisation anisotropies .",
    "these are generated by expressions of the form @xmath77.\\ ] ] here , the source is very firmly localised to the sls and so is sensitive to the thermal history and gravitational - wave evolution at that time .",
    "this is sensible . treating the early radiation bath as unpolarised ( as we expect from suppression of anisotropy during the tightly - coupled regime ) , then polarisation is generated by thomson scattering of an anisotropic intensity distribution .",
    "where does this anisotropy come from ? in the rest frame of the scattering electron ,",
    "photons arrive from all directions from a mean distance determined by the mean free path of photons at recombination . in propagating ,",
    "these photons experience the isw effect , discussed in the case of the temperature spectrum , and so arrive at the scatterer with altered temperatures .",
    "the resulting anisotropic temperature distribution is scattered , generating polarisation which free - streams to the present epoch .    in this way",
    ", we can understand the power spectrum . for modes with wavelengths much larger than the horizon size at last scattering , incident photons experience very little isw before the last scattering event and little polarisation is generated .",
    "optimal isw and thus maximal polarisation is generated by modes that enter the horizon at the time of penultimate scattering .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational - wave decays most rapidly immediately on horizon entry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hplot ] ) before settling into oscillation with a slowly decreasing amplitude .",
    "modes that enter the horizon before penultimate scattering lead to photons whose isw samples this slowly decaying regime .",
    "hence , they generate significant polarisation , but less than for the optimal case .",
    "note that the time between penultimate and last scattering will be about the width of the surface of last scattering .",
    "satisfies @xmath78 .",
    "shown solutions are numerical without anisotropic stress ( solid curve ) , numerical with anisotropic stress ( dotted curve ) , radiation ( long dashed curve ) , matter ( short dashed curve ) , and wkb ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "the two vertical lines denote @xmath79 and @xmath80 . ]    translating this into the form of the polarisation power spectrum , we expect a slow increase in power at large scales peaking at the scale of the horizon at penultimate scattering . immediately after this , we expect a large drop in polarisation corresponding to the transition between modes that enter the horizon between penultimate and last scattering and those that do not .",
    "next , we expect a steady decline in power as modes have entered the horizon before penultimate scattering and so redshifted away before the isw effect is generated .",
    "this region will show a transition in slope between modes that entered the horizon in the matter- and radiation - dominated epochs . on scales",
    "smaller than the mean free path at recombination , the power will drop sharply as phase cancellation between differing crests and troughs becomes important .    in this discussion , it is important to realise that only three scales have entered the problem .",
    "these are the comoving horizon at recombination , the horizon at matter - radiation equality , and the width of the last - scattering surface .",

    "it has been shown @xcite that anisotropic stress generated by free - streaming neutrinos acts to provide viscosity , further damping the tensor modes .",
    "this effect is important only while the energy density in neutrinos is a significant fraction of the total energy ; i.e. , during the radiation - dominated epoch .",

    "physically , this corresponds to a mode that is frozen beyond the horizon until its wavelength is of order the horizon size at which point it enters the horizon and redshifts rapidly with the expansion of the universe .",

    "so have evolved little in the radiation - dominated epoch , we expect @xmath98 to be a good description . for modes that entered during radiation domination , we expect that the transition from radiation to matter domination will affect the evolution significantly .",
    "the matter - radiation transition can be accounted for in a variety of ways .",

    "other approaches exist to handle this transition from radiation to matter in a more pragmatic fashion @xcite .",
    "we can get the scaling of @xmath35 from a simple argument . before horizon entry ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath35 of a gravitational - wave is constant .",
    "after horizon entry , the gravitational - wave redshifts with the expansion as radiation and scales as @xmath115 .",
    "hence , the amplitudes of a gravitational - wave today and at horizon entry are related by @xmath116 . taking @xmath117 to be independent of @xmath26 ,",
    "we have @xmath118 .",
    "horizon entry occurs when @xmath119 , and so from the scaling of @xmath120 in the matter- and radiation - dominated epochs we obtain @xmath121 when radiation dominated and @xmath122 when matter dominated .",

    "however the dominant source of temperature anisotropy is the isw effect , which is insensitive to the recombination history , and so we do not expect to see this behaviour in the temperature power spectrum .",
    "one way to see this is to examine the kernel in eq . .",
    "on small scales , which enter the horizon before @xmath83 , the finite rise time of @xmath129 alters the weight in the integral by a nearly constant factor . for all other modes , it is sufficient to simply truncate the range of the integral to between @xmath83 and @xmath51 , effectively imposing instantaneous recombination . on the other hand ,",
