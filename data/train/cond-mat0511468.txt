    "it is well established that low temperature charge transport through an interface between a normal metal and a superconductor ( ns ) is dominated by andreev reflection @xcite : an electron with energy below the superconducting gap @xmath3 enters the superconductor from the normal metal , forms a cooper pair together with another electron , while a hole goes back into the normal metal .",

    "the combination of `` normal '' and andreev reflection mechanisms is essential for proper understanding of transport phenomena in proximity structures composed of superconducting and normal metals .",

    "while the approach @xcite takes into account coulomb interaction within a phenomenological scheme of the so - called @xmath14-theory @xcite , the question remains if and under which conditions this scheme is sufficient to account for the effect of electron - electron interactions in a disordered normal metal attached to a superconductor . in this paper",
    "we develop a microscopic analysis of this problem and evaluate the interaction correction to andreev conductance of diffusive ns structures .",
    "we demonstrate that both the form and the magnitude of this interaction correction essentially depend on the dimensionality of the sample as well as on the relation between temperature and applied voltage to the relevant thouless energy of the structure .",
    "in particular , we predict that at sufficiently low energies the interaction correction _ saturates _ to a constant value , thus providing a temperature- and voltage - independent renormalization of andreev conductance .",

    "note , that the quasi-1d logarithmic behavior ( [ f1 ] ) is rather robust and can manifest itself for a wide range of voltages even if the sample length @xmath16 is not really much bigger than its width and thickness .",

    "our effective action analysis also allows to study fluctuations of andreev current in diffusive ns structures in the presence of electron - electron interactions .",

    "one can derive the following relationship @xmath251 which remains valid irrespective of the dimensionality at frequencies and voltages smaller than both the inverse charge relaxation time @xmath252 and the inverse elastic scattering time @xmath186 .",
    "note that the analogous expression between the current and the noise spectrum was derived in ref . for normal tunnel barriers with interactions treated by means of the @xmath14-theory and in ref . within a more general theoretical framework . here",

    "( [ nc ] ) reduces to the generalized schottky relation @xmath254 previously obtained in ref . in the absence of interactions .    combining eq .",
    "( [ nc ] ) with the results derived in the previous section one can fully describe the effect of coulomb interaction on andreev current noise in diffusive ns structures .",
    "hence , there is no need to go into further details here .",
    "let us only mention that  similarly to the andreev conductance  at voltages / frequencies below @xmath255 we expect shot noise to be suppressed by the factor @xmath256 . at larger voltages @xmath257 and in the low frequency limit the shot noise for quasi-1d",
    "ns structures should scale as @xmath258",
    "the main observations of the present work can be summarized as follows . in hybrid ns structures",
    "electron - electron interactions generate two types of corrections to andreev current .",
    "one of them is just a voltage - independent renormalization of the @xmath140 curve by the factor @xmath256 , while the other in general depends on voltage and/or temperature .",
    "the net effect of electron - electron interactions is always a reduction of the andreev conductance .",
    "this reduction approaches its maximum value at temperatures and voltages below the thouless energy of the sample . in this low energy regime",
    "the tunnel barrier and a normal metal act as a single coherent scatterer , whereas at energies above @xmath255 they can be treated as independent ones in the spirit of the @xmath14-theory .",
    "the magnitude of coulomb effects essentially depends on the system dimensionality and is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath164 . in 3d systems we find @xmath259 , i.e. in this case coulomb suppression of the andreev conductance is weak except for very disordered samples . in the 2d case",
    "@xmath164 is proportional to the parameter @xmath260 ( which is again small ) but is enhanced by the two logarithmic factors ( cf .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) ) , i.e. the net effect of electron - electron interactions is not necessarily weak in this case .",
    "this effect becomes even more pronounced in quasi-1d systems in which case the value @xmath164 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "obviously , the coulomb suppression of the andreev conductance can be very strong for such systems .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ zba ] ) , ( [ zba0 ] ) and ( [ satt ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , and having in mind that for typical values of the fermi velocity in metals one has @xmath261 , we arrive at a very simple estimate for the andreev conductance in the presence of electron - electron interactions : @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the number of conducting channels in the normal wire . in eq .",
    "( [ estim ] ) for simplicity we have disregarded an additional weak ( logarithmic ) dependence on @xmath16 and @xmath20 , cf .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) . within this accuracy , eq .",
    "( [ estim ] ) demonstrates that coulomb suppression of the andreev conductance in quasi-1d diffusive samples is determined by the number of conducting channels to the power @xmath219 .",
    "we believe this prediction can be directly tested in future experiments .",
    "recently the authors @xcite have experimentally investigated the @xmath140 curves for hybrid systems composed of multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( mwnt ) attached to a superconducting electrode .",
    "the measurements @xcite performed below the superconducting critical temperature @xmath264 have revealed power - law dependencies of the differential conductance on voltage and temperature @xmath265 and @xmath266 . at smaller voltages @xmath267 mv the conductance",
    "was found to saturate to a constant value . also at @xmath268 the power - law dependencies",
    "have been observed @xmath269 with the value @xmath270 somewhat smaller than @xmath271 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our theoretical predictions with these experimental results .",
    "the effect of conductance saturation observed in ref .",
    "just matches with our prediction ( [ estim ] ) and the value @xmath272 appears to be in a good agreement with the thouless energy @xmath273 estimated for mwnt @xcite . also the observed power - law dependencies are consistent with our theoretical picture . identifying @xmath274 and making use of the experimental value @xmath275",
    ", we can estimate the effective dimensionless conductance for mwnt as @xmath276 .",
    "above @xmath264 for the superconducting electrode one also expects the power - law dependence of the conductance on temperature @xcite . neglecting the impedance of the bulk electrode one would trivially get @xmath277 which is slightly smaller than the measured values @xmath278 close to @xmath264 and @xmath279 at higher temperatures .",
    "it is clear , however , that above @xmath264 the impedance of the superconducting electrode @xmath280 becomes non - zero and should also be taken into account .",
    "accordingly , the value @xmath270 should be modified as @xmath281 , where @xmath282 .",
    "this additional contribution to @xmath270 could further improve the quantitative agreement between our theory and the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that it would also be interesting to experimentally study the effect of coulomb interactions on the shot noise in quasi-1d hybrid ns systems , like , e.g. , ones investigated in ref . .",
    "according to the results obtained in sec .",
    "vi , at low voltages one expects suppression of the shot noise by the factor @xmath283 while at higher voltages the power - law dependence ( [ pl ] ) should be recovered .",
    "simultaneous current and shot noise measurements could help to experimentally verify the general relation ( [ nc ] ) between the noise spectrum and andreev current in hybrid ns structures .",
