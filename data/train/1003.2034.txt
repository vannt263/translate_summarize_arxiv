    "does not exclude a possibility of a continuous transition . according to ref .",

    "we place two types of ising variables @xmath105 at each triangle @xmath106 ( rather than each joint ) ; see fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] ( a ) .",
    "hence , hereafter , we consider the a spin model on the dual ( hexagonal ) lattice .",
    "the gauge rule sets the joint angle between the adjacent triangles .",
    "that is , provided that the @xmath107 spins are antiparallel ( @xmath108 ) for a pair of adjacent neighbors , the joint angle is either an acute or obtuse fold .",

    "<S> , we analyze the singularities of the crumpling transitions for a wide range of the bending rigidity @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a series of the crumpling transitions at @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . at each transition point </S>",
