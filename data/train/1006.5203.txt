    "transport properties of quantum devices beyond the linear response regime have generated a lot of interest in the past decade .",
    "experimentally , this is due to the recent advances in nanotechnology that permit to apply large electrical fields in low dimensional electronic structures .",
    "theoretically , transport beyond the linear response regime is interesting since it explores genuine non - equilibrium quantum many - body phenomena . a particularly well - studied case ,",
    "both experimentally and theoretically , are quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime that display kondo physics @xcite : here the shot noise generated by the steady state current serves as a source of decoherence that suppresses the kondo quasiparticle resonance for sufficiently large voltage bias @xcite , thereby reducing the differential conductance @xcite .    however , the interplay of correlation physics and non - equilibrium is difficult to address theoretically , in spite of considerable effort in recent years .",
    "new numerical methods have been developed like the scattering state numerical renormalization group @xcite , monte carlo methods @xcite , the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group @xcite and other real time methods @xcite .",
    "analytical approaches are perturbative keldysh calculations @xcite , extensions of the renormalization group @xcite , generalizations of nca ( non - crossing approximation ) to non - equilibrium @xcite , @xmath1-expansions @xcite , gutzwiller methods @xcite and various approaches builing on integrability @xcite .",
    "since all of these methods have their respective limited domain of applicability , there is still a need for new theoretical methods .    in the past few years",
    "the flow equation method ( method of infinitesimal unitary transformations ) @xcite was used for a number of non - equilibrium quantum many - body problems like interaction quenches @xcite and dc - transport beyond the linear response regime @xcite . in particular , for the kondo model numerous quantities like spin susceptiblity , magnetization and t - matrix have been calculated for large voltage bias in the steady state @xcite .",
    "in addition , the flow equation method is particularly suitable for calculating the real time evolution of non - equilibrium problems @xcite .",
    "therefore it offers the possibility to study the transient time - dependent buildup of a quantity until it reaches its steady state value , see for example the calculation of the magnetization dynamics in the ferromagnetic kondo model @xcite .",
    "this defines the question investigated in this paper : using the flow equation method , we calculate the time - dependent buildup of the electrical current through an anderson impurity model when the coupling between the leads and the quantum dot is suddenly switched on at time @xmath0 .",
    "thereby we develop a new analytical method for calculating transport properties of interacting quantum systems beyond the linear response regime , both for transient and steady state behavior .",
    "the model of a single level quantum dot coupled to two leads is described by the anderson impurity hamiltonian : @xmath2 @xmath3 denotes the wave vector , @xmath4 the electron spin and @xmath5 the left and right lead . for time @xmath6 both leads are in equilibrium at different chemical potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the hybridzation @xmath9 between leads and the dot is then switched on at time @xmath0 and we are interested in the current @xmath10 as a function of time . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to symmetric coupling to the leads , although the calculation can be generalized in a straightforward way .",
    "an explicit expression for @xmath10 is achieved via the forward - backward technique of the flow equation method @xcite : the current operator is expressed in the diagonal basis of the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) , where its time evolution can be worked out easily .",
    "then the time - evolved operator is transformed back into the original basis , where the initial condition of non - interacting fermi gases with different chemical potentials is given .",
    "this yields the final answer with an explicit expression for the current as a function of time .",
    "approximations enter during the diagonalization step of the hamiltonian , which limits our calculation to weak and intermediate interaction  @xmath11",
    ". however , the voltage bias can be large ( beyond the linear response regime ) and the real time evolution followed into the asymptotic steady state limit without any difficulties .",
    "we employ a symmetric / antisymmetric basis @xmath12 and re - express the hamiltonian as @xmath13 notice that only the symmetric combination of lead operators couples to the impurity orbital , which plays an important role in the solution later .    in order to work out the flow equation solution for the current , it turns out to be convenient to use a finite system with a discrete level spacing .",
    "the thermodynamic limit will then be taken at the very end when the current is evaluated .",
    "we take a constant level spacing @xmath14 corresponding to a constant and equal density of states @xmath15 in both leads . the symmetric non - interacting terms in the hamiltonian can then be diagonalized  @xcite @xmath16 by defining the _ pre - diagonalized _ basis @xmath17 with the transformation coefficient @xmath18 and the linewidth @xmath19 .",
    "the inverse tranformation is @xmath20 and through this the interaction term can also be expressed in the pre - diagonalized basis : @xmath21    in the sequel we will work with normal - ordered expressions . in this model",
    "we define normal ordering with respect to the non - interacting ground state in equilibrium , which is also the initial state at time @xmath0 .",
    "the chemical potentials of the left and right lead are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and @xmath22 denotes the voltage bias . strictly speaking , the fermi function in the pre - diagonalized basis has no sharp edge even at zero temperature due to hybridization .",
    "but this effect vanishes in the thermodynamic limit and we can use @xmath23 with the usual fermi function @xmath24 in this paper we will generally work at zero temperature ( @xmath25 ) , the generalization to non - zero temperature is straightforward .    the starting point of our analysis is the following hamiltonian @xmath26 which corresponds to ( [ model ] ) with a single - particle energy @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the energy of the impurity level is then related to the lead chemical potentials , i.e. at zero temperature by @xmath28 -\\mu,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 .",
    "the natural parameters in an experiment are @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath11 ( see fig .  1 ) . for convenience",
    "the calculations in this paper will be expressed through the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 ( or @xmath32 , @xmath31 and @xmath11 ) .",
