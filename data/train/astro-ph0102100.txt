    "the system displays behavior on four separate periodicities  the pulsar spin period ( 1.24-s ) , the binary orbit ( 1.7-d ) , a super period of 35-d which results from a retrograde - precessing , warped accretion disk , and a beat between the precessional and orbital periods of 1.62-d .",
    "the warp engine is poorly understood but is likely to be a combination of both radiation- and tidally - driven precession ( papaloizou & terquem 1995 ; pringle 1996 ) .",

    "the main - high has a rapid turn - on over @xmath290-m and decays over @xmath210-d .",
    "a low - state where flux remains at 35 percent of the high - state level follows for the next @xmath210-d , succeeded by a second short - high state , lasting @xmath25-d , with flux peaking at @xmath230 percent of the main - high state maximum .",
    "a further low - state completes the cycle and extends over the next @xmath210-d .",
    "uv , optical and infrared wavelengths are dominated by x - ray emission reprocessed over the inner face of the companion star .",
    "there is no high  low state switching in these wavebands because the pulsar is always visible to a large fraction of the companion star s surface , however the accretion disk casts a shadow over the stellar photosphere , whose terminator migrates on the precession timescale .",
    "consequently , the super - cycle is also observed at uv , optical and infra - red energies ( gerend & boynton 1976 ) .",
    "the 35-d clock has remained quasi - coherent since it s discovery , although there have been two recorded occasions when the clock has missed several consecutive turn - ons ( parmar 1985 ; 1999 ) , and one occasion when the x - ray flux during main - high states was significantly reduced ( vrtilek 1994 ) .",
    "the cause of these anomalous low - states is not clear , but they probably result from changes in the state of the accretion disk , either through an increase in vertical scale height , or modifications to the disk warp .",

    "the data presented in this paper were taken at mjd 51000 which appears to be a normal short - high state .",
    "however all subsequent short - high states appear either to be absent or weak within the sensitivity limits of the asm .",
    "this suggests that a precursor to the anomalous low state may be a weakening of short - high states beginning some 200 days before the main - high states vanish .",
    "this would have consequences for the timescale of mass transfer variability in the system , and the dynamical reaction time of the disk warp to mass transfer rate onto the neutron star .",

    "it was suggested that variability is related to the 35-d cycle , although no correlation has been searched for . however , by folding spectral models of visits 9 and 10 ( section 4 ) through the response matrix of the _ lac _ we find these residual counts to be consistent with the _ ginga _ detection of 2.1 countss@xmath10 at @xmath11 .    between mjd 51005.851006.8",
    "we observe an extended dip with duration @xmath2 half an orbital period . although our sampling is not ideal the data are suggestive of dips with similar phasing and duration during both the preceding and following orbital cycles .",
    "this is confirmed by the more complete sampling of the contemporaneous  observations of oosterbroek ( 2000 ) .",
    "dip ingresses occur earlier each consecutive orbit , while the dip duration increases .",
    "hardness ratios suggest these are , at least partially , the result of photoelectric absorption , although the dips remain strong features at energies @xmath12 . both shakura ( 1998 ) and",
    "scott & leahy ( 1999 ) folded data from the  asm archive and found that short - high state dips have significantly longer durations than main - high state dips .",
    "the asm shows the width of these features is coherent from cycle to cycle over many years and therefore is not related to the impending x - ray low - state .",
    "long dip durations are probably the result of blending by numerous unresolved shorter events ( parmar & reynolds 1995 ) .",
    "crosa & boynton ( 1980 ) determined that dip ingresses migrate linearly towards earlier orbital phase over each 35-d period , where the time between successive ingresses is 1.65 days .",
    "although this is not exactly the beat between the 35-d and orbital cycles , crosa and boynton suggest that the dips are the result of periodic increases in the scale height of the outer accretion disk brought on by bursts of mass transfer as the @xmath13 point of the companion star sweeps through the x - ray shadow of the disk .",
    "the dip period is the sum of the beat period and the orbital timescale of structure in the outer disk to travel from the accretion stream impact point to the pulsar line of sight .",
    "it is difficult to see how this model incorporates dips of precession - coherent duration unless the accretion stream meets the disk at a radius that varies over the 35-d cycle .",
    "this would result in a range of orbital frequencies for the newly - arrived gas that broadens the dip .",
    "schandl ( 1996 ) suggests the 1.65 day dip period results from the accretion stream skimming over the surface of the disk and crashing into it at a disk radius and azimuth that vary over the 35-d cycle due to the disks warped shape .",
    "the width of the dips would most likely increase as the stream migrated closer to the disk s center , where an arbitrary surface area subtends a larger occulting angle for the compact object .",
    "the detailed shape of schandl s model is not consistent with the inference that the stream reaches the inner accretion disk during the short - high phase of the cycle , but this particular disk shape also fails to reproduce the observed x - ray and optical variability from the source .",
    "however , by adopting this type of model for the dips , it may be possible to constrain disk shape by measuring the duration of dips as a function of 35-d phase .",

    "we expect both partial - covering absorption from the tenuous upper atmosphere of the disk and opaque obscuration from the thick disk at smaller heights above the mid - disk .",
    "similarly , dips are possibly the result of periodic increases in disk height ( crosa & boynton 1980 ) , absorption from the `` bright spot '' impact site between stream and disk ( choi 1994a ) , or the accretion stream itself with ejecta from the impact splashing above the disk plane ( schandl 1996 ) . in this section",

    "a single absorber is probably unsuitable to fit a system containing an accretion disk whose density varies with vertical height , and with further possible absorption from winds , coronae and magnetic accretion columns .",
    "however the data would do a poor job constraining the large number of free parameters a more complex fit requires .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the partial covering model to provide a better statistical fit than the homogeneous absorption model .",

    "channels 80255 ( 30100 kev ) were ignored as a result of poor counting statistics .",
    "channels 16 were ignored due to uncertainties in background modeling .",
    "a cyclotron absorption feature of energy 3040  is usually present in the spectrum of  ( e.g. mihara 1990 ; dal fiume 1998 ) .",
    "the soft wing of this feature encroaches the pca bandpass . including this wing in the model provides acceptable fits but since the center of the line is not sampled the line parameters afford too much freedom to the low energy components of the model .",

    "this indicates that variability in @xmath36 is driven by both solid - body obscuration and cold , partial absorption , at least within the framework of this limited spectral model .",
    "the reality is plausibly partial- or fully - covered absorption by a medium of spatially varying density , as you would expect from the atmosphere of an accretion disk .    within measurement uncertainties the energy of the fe line is constant at @xmath37   over the duration of the pointings .",
    "this is slightly lower than the measurement of oosterbroek ( 2000 ) and  observations in general .",
    "this could in principle result from erroneously adopting @xmath22 . however , adopting powerlaws of various fixed slope provides no energy increase and yields either identical or poorer fit quality . additionally , allowing @xmath17 freedom to vary within the fit improves @xmath33 but the line energy does not increase significantly",

    "[ pdot ] displays the neutron star spin period history of over the previous 30 years .",
    "the general trend is one of spin - up , but with at least two episodes of spin - down at @xmath2  mjd 45000 and @xmath2  mjd 49000 .",
    "these spin - down episodes coincide with the two anomalous low states previously reported by parmar ( 1985 ) and vrtilek ( 1994 ) .",
    "this indicates that the anomalous low - states are related to a change in the location of the threading region , where gas is stripped from the accretion disk by the magnetic field of the pulsar .",
    "if the characteristic distance of this region is closer to the neutron star than the co - rotation radius , where the rotational velocity of the accretion disk exceeds the rotational velocity of the compact object , then assuming conservation of energy and angular momentum , the star will be spun - up .",
    "conversely if the threading region occurs outside the co - rotation radius , we expect spin - down . ignoring any diamagnetic properties of the accreting gas ( king 1993 )",
    ", the location of the threading region is governed by the balance between magnetic pressure and the ram pressure of the infall .",
    "consequently observations of spin - down during the anomalous low - states are naturally explained by a decrease in the mass transfer rate in the inner disk .",
    "accretion does not stop altogether since uv and optical observations indicate that the companion star is still irradiated strongly by x - rays from the central object and inner disk ( vrtilek 2001 ) .",
    "the continued brightness at optical and uv wavelengths also seemingly rules out the alternative suggestion by van kerkwijk ( 1998 ) that spin - torque reversals are the result of accretion disk warp flipping the inner disk over by 180 degrees .    furthermore deeter ( 1991 )",
    "show that there is also an increase in the orbital period of the binary over time ( see fig .",
    "[ o - c ] ) and suggest that a broken linear expression provides a better fit to the period measurements than a continuous one .",
    "the break coincides with the low - state at @xmath2 mjd 45000 , suggesting that the anomalous lows also have a measurable effect on the orbital rate .",
    "this result is less convincing than stellar spin - up measurements and requires confirmation from orbital timing during , and after , other anomalous low - states .",

    "we see no obvious signatures of components b , c or e in the observed profiles , consistent both with this model and in agreement with the   satellite observations of the short - high state ( deeter 1998 ) .",
    "the top three profiles of fig .  [ pulses ] , extracted during the short - high state maximum , are consistent with the profiles presented by slw from a similar 35-d phase , showing a narrow peak at  = 0.5 , superimposed on a broad asymmetric modulation with minimum at  = 0.7 and maximum at  = 0.3 , thus rising slower than it falls . between the d and a peaks is a minimum at  = 0.6 .",
    "it is reasonable to associate the narrow peak with component a , which slw model as emission back - scattered off the near curtain , close to the magnetic pole on the surface of the pulsar .",
    "we associate the broad peak with component d , which is emission from the same curtain , but significantly higher above the surface of the star .",
    "component a is harder than component d. component a intensity and hardness ratio are directly correlated , while component d intensity and hardness ratio do not appear to be correlated over the whole pulse cycle .",
    "the hardness ratio has a sharp maximum at  = 0.5 , corresponding to the sharp intensity peak a , and a broad roughly sinusoidal modulation peaking at  = 0.5 , half way up the intensity rise of component d. the dip at  = 0.6 is not accompanied by an increase in hardness ratio , as expected from photoelectric absorption .",
    "the next row of profiles are sampled during mid - eclipse . during mid -",
    "eclipse the count rate is 100 times less than the high state peak however hardness ratios are essentially unchanged , consistent with the findings of choi ( 1994 ) .",
    "pulse fractions decrease during eclipse and there is no compelling evidence for pulses .",
    "consequently the pulses are more deeply eclipsed than the mean light .",
    "the residual is thought to result from a corona surrounding the accretion disk and neutron star and/or the companion star ( e.g. , leahy 1995 ) .",
    "the third set of pulse profiles have been taken from the post - eclipse recovery . in the time between the first and third pulses ,",
    "component a has disappeared from the profiles .",
    "this is consistent both with the  observations in the latter stages of the short - high state and the accretion disk occulting the region responsible for this component .",
    "component d is slightly harder than before eclipse , suggesting a higher column density in front of this region .",
    "set 4 of pulse profiles was extracted from the center of the next absorption dip .",
    "the hardness ratio has increased by a factor 3 over pre - dip pulses , expected from photoelectric absorption , and the dip at  = 0.6 has disappeared .",
    "here there are two peaks at  = 0.2 and  = 0.5 and there is tentative evidence that both peaks are accompanied by corresponding increases in hardness . unlike previous visits , intensity and hardness ratio are directly correlated .",
    "no pulses are detected in the 25  band .",
    "pulses extracted after the dip and displayed as set 5 show a predictable decrease in hardness ratio .",
    "however the correlation between intensity and hardness ratio remains , as do the two peaks at  = 0.2 and  = 0.5 .    in the final set of light curves , the mean",
    "intensities are a factor 10 smaller than those in the top row , with hardness ratios indicating a larger absorption column .",
    "evidence for pulsations is marginal however , indicating that the pulse fraction is reduced by at least a factor 20 .",
    "the model of slw predicts that the pulse profile should become simpler as the short - high state evolves into the low state .",
    "this is the result of a number of emission regions being occulted by the disk , one - by - one as the 35-d cycle proceeds .",
    "this is not observed .",
    "the complexity of the pulse profile increases at the tail - end of the short - high state .",
    "since it is not possible for component a to re - emerge from behind the accretion disk at some time during mjd  51005.25.6 , the simplest interpretation for the maximum at   = 0.5 is that the pulse shape of component d evolves from a single asymmetric peak to a double - peaked form .",
    "since the hardness ratios indicate no obvious photoelectric absorption event between the two peaks , perhaps the easiest way to achieve this involves a physical change in the geometry of the accretion flow .",
    "this is a reasonable solution since the location of the threading region between disk and curtain will be modified cyclically with the precession of the accretion disk .",
    "we have presented 330  pca data of what could arguably be one of the last normal short - high states of the x - ray pulsar before it entered an anomalous low - state of activity .",
    "[ asm ] illustrates that the  asm detected its last major main - high state before the anomalous low at mjd 51195 .",
    "there were very few ( if perhaps no ) short - high states detected after mjd 51004 , although we note  is a source undergoing deep eclipses and dip events and the asm data does not have ideal sampling .",
    "since accretion disk structure is projected closer to the x - ray source during short - high states it is likely that the disappearance of short - high states may be a precursor indicating an impending anomalous low - state .",
    "we suggest that the event that caused the anomalous low may have began some time before it was noticed in the asm .",
    "a study of pulse timings over this period may reveal that spin - down began ( or that spin - up was decelerating ) long before the high states disappeared . an interesting test to perform would be the measurement of @xmath0 more uniformly over the epoch covered by fig .",
    "[ asm ] using timings from the _ batse _ experiment that was on board _ cgro _",
    "( e.g. , wilson , scott & finger 1997 ) . comparing the current epoch pca data with the large sample of short - high states collected by the  asm and the limited number of previous pointed short - high state observations by ,",
    "we find no evidence for this particular short - high state to be considered special .",
    "broad - band timing verifies that the pre - eclipse dips during the short - high state have durations longer than the characteristic durations of dips during main - high states ( scott & leahy 1999 ) .",
    "it appears likely that dip durations are related to the location of the gas stream impact with the accretion disk , the trajectory of the stream and the shape of the disk at the impact point .",
    "detailed hydrodynamical calculations may be able to place model constraints on these properties using dip observations .",
    "spectrally , the short - high state and the dips are consistent with obscuration of a central x - ray source by a cloud of varying column density .",
    "the standard model of a warped accretion disk of finite scale height fits this picture well .    some modification to the recent pulse model of slw",
    "is required to explain the evolution of pulse profiles , from relatively simple to more complex , during the tail of the short - high state .",
    "we suggest ( as do slw ) that geometric changes in the accretion curtains need to be considered to model the pulse profiles correctly .",
