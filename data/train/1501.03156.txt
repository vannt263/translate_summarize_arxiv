    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been extremely successful in explaining all microscopic phenomena observed down to distances of order @xmath9 . however , the model has two notable under - explored corners : the neutrino and higgs sectors .",
    "having discovered the higgs boson the next major goal of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to scrutinize the properties of the higgs boson and search for deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "a particularly interesting question is whether cp is a good symmetry of the higgs sector .",
    "since all higgs boson couplings are predicted to be cp even in the sm , any observation of a cp - odd or cp - violating component will constitute unambiguous evidence of physics beyond the sm .",
    "cp - violating higgs interactions may be motivated by the fact that baryogenesis requires the existence of a new source of cp violation and the possibility that such a primordial source of new cp violation may leave traces in the couplings of the higgs boson .",
    "recently , a novel variable @xmath1 for measuring the cp phase in the @xmath10-@xmath5-@xmath5 coupling was proposed in ref .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 was shown to have the simple form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the phase of the @xmath10-@xmath5-@xmath5 yukawa coupling , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 corresponding to the cp - even and -odd limits , respectively , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are independent of @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "what distinguishes the @xmath10-@xmath5-@xmath5 yukawa coupling from other couplings is that its _ phase _ ( i.e.  the cp angle @xmath12 ) is currently completely unconstrained by data  @xcite , even though its _ magnitude _ ( i.e.  the rate of @xmath17-@xmath18 production ) is roughly consistent with the sm prediction  @xcite . field theoretically , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , an @xmath19 @xmath12 in the @xmath10-@xmath5-@xmath5 coupling can easily coexist with other higgs boson couplings whose cp phases are known to be small , such as @xmath10-@xmath20-@xmath21 and @xmath10-@xmath22-@xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively  @xcite ) , and @xmath10-@xmath26-@xmath26 ( for which @xmath27 is disfavored  @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite using parton - level analyses it is estimated that the @xmath10-@xmath5-@xmath5 cp phase , @xmath12 , may be measured from the @xmath1 distribution to an accuracy of @xmath28 at the 14-tev lhc with @xmath29 of data , or the @xmath7 and @xmath8 cases may be distinguished at @xmath30 level with @xmath31 .",
    "however , these conclusions are for an ideal detector . in this paper",
    ", we examine the impact of realistic detector effects on the measurement of @xmath12 via @xmath1 .",
    "there are various ways that detector effects can affect those estimates .",
    "most importantly , the reconstruction of the @xmath1 variable requires resolving the charged and neutral pions in the @xmath32 decay mode , but these @xmath33 are highly boosted as they come from higgs decays .",
    "one therefore expects the two photons from each @xmath4 decay to hit the same tower of the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) , thereby making the standard identification of a @xmath4 using photons useless .",
    "moreover , one expects the same ecal tower to be hit by the @xmath3 , raising the question of how much of the ecal tower s",
    "activity should be attributed to the @xmath4 .",
    "another obvious issue is the reconstruction of the neutrinos . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the so - called collinear approximation  @xcite is adopted , where the neutrino from each @xmath5 decay is taken to be exactly collinear with its parent @xmath5 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the collinear approximation results in a 6070% reduction of the amplitude of the @xmath34 curve .",
    "so , one might expect that here lies a significant opportunity for improvement . in this paper , however , we present a theoretical calculation that strongly suggests that it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to outperform the collinear approximation for the purpose of @xmath1 reconstruction .    adopting the collinear approximation ,",
    "we then focus on the aforementioned issues of pion identifications in the presence of realistic detector effects , and propose a realistic algorithm to identify `` @xmath5 candidates '' specifically suited for constructing @xmath1 .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the amplitude of the @xmath34 curve of the signal is virtually unchanged by the finite angular resolution of the lhc detectors . instead",
    ", we find that the measurement of @xmath12 through the @xmath1 distribution is significantly hampered by the contamination by the @xmath35 background .",
    "this degradation arises due to resolution effects in reconstructing the @xmath36 invariant mass as a consequence of large uncertainties in the measurement of the missing transverse energy .",
    "fortunately , this is an area where future improvement can be hoped for , unlike the angular resolution .",
    "we leave the important question of pileup effects for future work .    while we focus on the measurement of @xmath12 through the @xmath1 variable , similar but different acoplanarity angles",
    "have been studied both for @xmath37 colliders  @xcite as well as for the lhc  @xcite . for the @xmath2 decay mode , which is the most dominant decay mode of the @xmath5 , the acoplanarity angles used in those studies are not as effective as the @xmath1 variable at @xmath37 colliders in which the neutrino momenta can be reconstructed up to a two - fold ambiguity  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the lhc studies mentioned above is that they can be applied to all 1-prong @xmath5 decays including leptonic decays .",
    "however , realistic detector effects are not considered in those studies .",
    "@xcite performs a realistic study for the lhc but assuming universal cp violation for all sm fermions , unlike our study in which we assume @xmath12 is non - zero only for the @xmath5 . finally , the use of the @xmath5 impact parameter associated with a displaced @xmath5 vertex was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath37 context .",
    "our @xmath1 variable does not depend on the measurement of the @xmath5 impact parameter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s.theory ] , we review the @xmath1 variable and rewrite it in a simple form by expanding it in terms of a small parameter @xmath38 that characterizes the degree of collinearity of the decay products of the taus , with @xmath39 in the exactly collinear limit .",
    "we use this expansion to argue that the collinear approximation appears the best we can do for the purpose of reconstructing @xmath1 .",
    "section  [ s.parton ] describes the parton level simulation of the signal and background processes .",
    "section  [ s.simulation ] describes the detector simulation and selection of the parametrized detector quantities corresponding to the higgs boson decay products .",

    ", we fix the @xmath10-@xmath5-@xmath5 yukawa coupling , @xmath42 , to its sm value @xmath43 with @xmath44 , but keep the cp phase @xmath12 as a free parameter to be measured .",

    "the subscripts @xmath49 and @xmath50 refer to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 branches of the decay , respectively ( e.g. , @xmath51 and @xmath52 )",

    "we define two lightlike 4-vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "whose spatial components , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are unit vectors taken along the 3-momenta of the @xmath62 from the @xmath5 decays : @xmath63 we also define @xmath64 then , an arbitrary 4-momentum @xmath65 can be expanded in terms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 as @xmath68 where @xmath69 by definition satisfies @xmath70 . alternatively , @xmath65 can be expanded in a similar manner in terms of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . to avoid notational clutter",
    ", we do not make explicit whether @xmath73 and @xmath69 are defined in the @xmath66-@xmath67 basis or the @xmath71-@xmath72 basis , but it should be clear that the momenta of all particles originating from the @xmath17 will be expanded in the @xmath66-@xmath67 basis , while those from @xmath18 will be in @xmath71-@xmath72 .",
    "next , we introduce a small expansion parameter @xmath74 to quantify the degree of collinearity between the @xmath33 and the respective @xmath62 . first , by construction , `` collinear ''",
    "means that @xmath75 is dominated by the @xmath76 component , @xmath77 , while the remaining components @xmath78 and @xmath79 are small .",
    "therefore , by definition , we assign the @xmath38 scaling law @xmath80 to the @xmath81 component .",
    "this implies that numerically we have @xmath82 .",
    "then , in the ultra - relativistic limit , we have @xmath83 , so we see that @xmath84 . to summarize",
    ", we characterize the collinearity of @xmath85 as @xmath86      since neutrinos are invisible at the lhc , we must devise a method to assign momenta to the neutrinos from the @xmath33 decays .",
    "however , the choice of method is a delicate issue for the reconstruction of the @xmath1 variable . performing the @xmath38 expansion in the expressions  ( [ e.theta ] ) ,",
    "we see that all @xmath87 and @xmath88 terms exactly cancel , so we are left with @xmath89 therefore , for the purpose of reconstructing @xmath1 , values must be carefully assigned to the invisible neutrino momenta so as not to disturb these delicate cancellations . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath38 scaling law  ( [ e.lambda_scaling ] ) must be respected .",
    "a simple method with this property is provided by the _ collinear approximation _",
    "@xcite , where we set @xmath90 for each @xmath91 . in other words ,",
    "the collinear approximation applies the @xmath39 limit to the @xmath5 and @xmath92 momenta .",
    "then , to @xmath93 , the expressions  ( [ e.theta ] ) become @xmath94 again with a common proportionality factor . finally ,",
    "noticing that the definitions of @xmath53 in  ( [ e.k ] ) give @xmath95 in the collinear approximation , we arrive at the following very simple expressions that determine @xmath1 : @xmath96 with a common proportionality factor .",
    "the 4-vectors @xmath97 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are defined in  ( [ e.q ] ) and  ( [ e.n1_and_n2 ] ) , respectively . in the rest of the paper , we use the expressions  ( [ e.theta:coll_approx ] ) to compute @xmath1 unless noted otherwise .",
    "one might think we should be able to do better than the collinear approximation by using statistical correlations of the neutrino momenta with other , visible , momenta in the process .",
    "however , the delicate cancellation shown in ( [ e.cancellations ] ) implies that the correlations must get the neutrino momenta correctly at the level of @xmath98 in order to outperform the collinear approximation .",
    "although we could not prove that this is impossible , it certainly suggests that it is extremely difficult .",
    "in this section , we outline our generation of the parton level samples used in the detector simulation . we generated tree level event samples with a combination of madgraph5  @xcite and mcfm as explained below for the background ( @xmath99 ) and the signal ( @xmath100 ) with @xmath101 gev for the jet .",
    "the associated jet facilitates triggering and provides sufficient @xmath102 transverse momentum for the collinear approximation to hold .",
    "other associated production modes could be used , notably @xmath103 and @xmath104 , but they have lower cross sections than @xmath100 , though potentially better signal to noise that could be exploited in a further study .",
    "multijet events are a potential background ; however , this background is found to be small once tau selection criteria are imposed .",
    "therefore , consideration of @xmath99 alone is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the jet-@xmath105 cut was imposed at the generator level in anticipation of the high-@xmath105 jet requirement we impose in our analysis to ensure that the event will pass the trigger as well as to avoid kinematic configurations where the @xmath102 is produced back - to - back in the transverse plane and the collinear approximation for the neutrino momenta fails .",
    "the model files were generated using feynrules package  @xcite by modifying the sm template provided by feynrules to include the cp violating coupling in the @xmath10-@xmath5-@xmath5 vertex as well as the effective vertices for the decay of @xmath106 and @xmath107 given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the projection operator onto left - handed chirality .",
    "we implement the higgs boson production from @xmath110 fusion using the effective field theory ( eft ) ( in which the top quark is integrated out ) available from the feynrules repository . in principle",
    ", such an effective vertex is applicable only when the energy scale of the process lies well below the mass of the top quark .",
    "however , using the mcfm program  @xcite , we have verified that the higgs boson @xmath105 distribution from the eft in the region of interest ( @xmath111 gev ) agrees at the percent level with the full 1-loop qcd calculation .",
    "finally , note that all the coupling constants in eq .",
    "( [ e.leff ] ) are set to unity .",
    "to get the physical cross section , we use the cross sections from mcfm re - weighted by @xmath112 and @xmath113 branching fractions .",
    "the cteq6l1 pdf set was used throughout .",
    "parton showering and hadronization effects are included by processing the madgraph5 samples using the pythia8 program  @xcite . in principle , higher order corrections can be implemented by including events with higher jet multiplicity from tree level matrix elements and performing the corresponding jet merging with pythia s parton showering . however , we have verified that the inclusion of these corrections do not affect the higgs boson @xmath105 distribution and they differ at most by a few percent in the region of interest .",
    "in order to incorporate detector effects into the measurement of the @xmath1 angle , we use the snowmass detector model  @xcite , implemented in delphes  3  @xcite . in delphes , energy from particles deposited within the calorimeter is partitioned between the electromagnetic and hadronic sections according to a fixed ratio .",
    "this ratio is unity for the fraction of energy from a charged pion deposited in the hadronic calorimeter , which fails to account for energy depositions from hadronic showers that begin before the hadronic calorimeter .",
    "we account for this effect , including potential systematic effects due to overlap between the energy deposition of the neutral pion and the charged pion , by distributing the energy of charged pions in both calorimeter sections according to a probability distribution that models the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite for 30gev pions .",
    "85% percent of the time the particle is presumed to deposit energy via ionization only , and the energy is entirely deposited within the hadronic calorimeter . for the remaining 15% of events , the fraction of the particle energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter is drawn from a gaussian distribution of mean 0.4 and width 0.3 ( selecting only physical values ) .",
    "the rest of the energy is assigned to the hadronic calorimeter .",
    "the gaussian models the probability with which the pion interacts early , in which case a significant fraction of its energy will be deposited in the ecal .",
    "tau identification in delphes is abstracted to an efficiency , which is insufficient for our purposes .",
    "therefore , we develop an algorithm to identify taus explicitly that assigns the charged pion and the neutral pion to a track and a calorimeter tower , respectively .",
    "we select jets reconstructed with the anti-@xmath114 algorithm  @xcite with a distance parameter of 0.5 , which are reconstructed in delphes using fastjet  @xcite .",
    "at least three jets are required in each event with @xmath115gev within @xmath116 ( the tracking limit of the detector ) , of which the lead jet must have @xmath117gev ( well above the parton level requirement of 70gev ) .",
    "all jets with @xmath11830gev are examined as potential @xmath5-candidates . the lead track within @xmath119 of the jet axis",
    "is selected , and the sum of the transverse momenta of the remaining tracks , within @xmath120 , is required to be less than 7gev in order to exclude jets that are unlikely to be taus .",
    "these selection requirements emulate the more sophisticated selection of taus in the lhc experiments , and are treated as equivalent to the delphes efficiency of 65% .",
    "we make further selections on the individual elements within the tau candidate in order to ensure that the decay products have been measured with sufficient precision for the calculation of @xmath1 .",
    "the lead track is required to have @xmath121gev , or this candidate is rejected .",
    "we then proceed to examine calorimeter towers within @xmath119 of the jet axis .",
    "we select the tower with the largest transverse energy in the electromagnetic portion of the tower .",
    "the tower in question must also have an electromagnetic fraction ( emf ) of 0.9 , that is , at least 90% of its total energy within the ecal .",
    "if this tower has @xmath122gev , is within @xmath123 of the selected track , and the sum of the selected tower transverse energy and the track momentum is greater than 20gev , then this jet becomes a @xmath5-candidate suitable for @xmath1 reconstruction , and the charged pion is assumed to be the selected track with the neutral pion the selected tower .    finally , the electromagnetic portion of the actual atlas and cms detectors have finer granularity than a single tower , which is not properly accounted for by the snowmass detector .",
    "to approximate a position resolution of one detector element of the lhc detectors , we introduce the resolution for the position in @xmath124-@xmath125 of the neutral pion as a gaussian smearing with standard deviation @xmath126 . a resolution no better than a tower ( as in the default snowmass detector )",
    "was found to degrade significantly the sensitivity to the modulation in the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "finally , events are required to have at least two @xmath5-candidates with opposite charges .",
    "should there be more than two @xmath5-candidates , the highest @xmath105 pair with opposite charge is selected .",
    "we now come to the critical question of whether the signal modulation survives detector effects . in order to answer that question , consider the analysis cut - flow shown in table  [ t.cutflow ] .",
    ".[t.cutflow]cut - flows for z@xmath127 and @xmath128 . the generator and reconstruction level cuts on the jet are @xmath129gev , and 100gev , respectively .",
