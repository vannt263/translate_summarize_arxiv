    "our understanding of the laws of physics we gained on earth has already been challenged by cosmological observations of the formation of galaxies and the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . in order to establish a cosmological standard model without inconsistencies between observations and",
    "known physics , it is unavoidable either to assume the presence of as yet undetected dark materials filling 95@xmath0 of the energy of the universe , or to modify some of the fundamental laws of physics such as einstein s general relativity .",
    "the information on the underlying physics of the universe is provided by looking at the formation of the large scale structure ( lss ) of matter in the universe .",
    "while current observations have revealed the breakdown of our knowledge of physics on cosmological scales , the future observation of the lss will provide a clue to reveal the nature of the late - time cosmic acceleration ; which part of our physical picture should be modified - matter or gravity , and how it is modified @xcite .",
    "the current standard cosmological model was established based upon unknown dark materials and the validity of general relativity ( gr ) on cosmological scales .",
    "we call this standard model _ smooth dark energy _ ( sde ) .",
    "it consists of the following energy components : 5@xmath0 baryons as described by the standard model of particle physics and 95@xmath0 of unobserved dark particles  20@xmath0 of collisionless dark matter , fitting galaxy formation and the peaks in the spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , and 75@xmath0 dark energy explaining the cosmic acceleration , described by a perfect fluid that is homogeneous ( smooth ) on sub - horizon scales .",
    "it is difficult to accept dark energy as a standard building block of energy components of the universe as it is not yet supported neither phenomenologically nor theoretically .",
    "gravity on cosmological scales can be modified to accelerate the cosmic expansion without dark energy .",
    "the degeneracy between gr and modified gravity ( mg ) models in the background expansion history is broken by the growth history of structure formation .",
    "any departure from the growth history in sde is probed by two functions expressing new degrees of freedom : the mass screening , @xmath1 , changes the relationship between the curvature perturbation and the matter over - densities , while the effective anisotropic stress , @xmath2 , alters the relationship between the curvature perturbation and the newtonian potential .    here",
    "we study whether the possible detection of non - trivial @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be considered as a probe of the break - down of the sde model at cosmological scales .",
    "we show that non - trivial @xmath1 and @xmath2 functions are also induced in other gr models via clustering of dark energy or interactions between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "gr will be confirmed ( or excluded ) by looking at the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , not merely by a departure of @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 from unity .",
    "we find that both mg models @xcite and exotic gr models @xcite provide unique distinguishable trajectories that are well presented in the plane of two transformed parameters : @xmath3 parameterises the relation between the lensing potential and matter over - densities and @xmath4 represents the relation between the newtonian potential and the matter over - densities .",
    "we examine these parameters in various models and show that each theory has a distinct path on the plane of those parameters .",
    "the understanding of these theoretical priors is essential to reveal the nature of the cosmic acceleration from future structure formation observations .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the _ smooth dark energy _ ( sde ) model and the modified growth parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ". then we investigate these functions for different cases : in section iii the brans - dicke ( bd ) theory is used to characterise modified gravity models on sub - horizon scales . in section",
    "iv we consider clustering dark energy ( cde ) models and in section v interacting dark energy ( ide ) models are studied . in section",
    "vi we show that these models have distinct paths in the plane of the modified growth parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we conclude in section vii .",
    "any deviation from our standard cosmological model sde will lead to modifications of the background evolution and structure growth .",
    "let us fix the background using the sde reference model and , subsequently , parameterise the modified growth in terms of the functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that these become trivial ( @xmath7 ) in sde .",
    "we assume a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background metric . in the sde model",
    "the friedmann equation defines the evolution of the hubble parameter , @xmath8 , in terms of the energy content of the universe h^2 = ( _ m^s+ _ de^s ) .",
    "[ eq : frgr ] we introduced the label `` @xmath9 '' to mark the quantities given in the sde model . in any other model",
    "we adjust the parameters such that @xmath8 evolves in the same way as in the sde reference model .",
    "next , we consider linear perturbations around the flat frw background described in the newtonian gauge : ds^2 = -(1 + 2)dt^2 + a^2(1 + 2)_ijdx^idx^j .",
    "we will use a dot to denote the derivative with respect to cosmic time , @xmath10 . in gr the newtonian potential @xmath11 and the curvature perturbation @xmath12",
    "are related to the matter content via the linearised einstein equations . in sde",
    "these yield two constraint equations .",
    "firstly , because there is no anisotropic stress at late times the two metric potentials coincide , @xmath13 , and secondly , the poisson equation relates @xmath12 to the comoving matter density perturbation @xmath14 : k^2 ^s= 4 g_n a^2 _ m^s_m^s . for a general fluid ( @xmath15 ) the comoving density perturbation",
    "is defined as _ i _ i - , in terms of the density contrast @xmath16 and the velocity divergence @xmath17 in the newtonian gauge .",
    "the comoving density perturbation @xmath14 is useful as it is the over - density measured by observers comoving with the matter - flow .    in any other gr dark energy or mg model the poisson equation",
    "is modified .",
    "this departure from sde in the poisson equation is parameterised by the function @xmath18 such that k^2 = 4 g_n a^2 q(a , k ) ^s_m _ m , [ def : q ] holds with @xmath14 being the comoving matter perturbation as measured in the modified model ( with the same background evolution as sde ) and @xmath19 that scales in the usual way with time ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "because @xmath12 and @xmath14 are gauge - invariant variables this is a gauge - invariant definition of @xmath1 . in mg models , @xmath1 represents the mass screening effect due to a local modification of gravity , i.e.  an effective modification of newton s constant . in exotic dark energy models within",
    "gr it measures the additional clustering due to a modification of the background evolution of the energy densities and different evolution of the perturbations .    in order to fully describe the modified growth of perturbations , the other constraint equation of gr needs to be parameterised as well .",
    "the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath11 is altered such that - is not necessarily trivial .",
    "as compared to sde in gr , where @xmath21 , a non - trivial @xmath2 effectively adds an anisotropic stress component at linear level .",
    "measuring @xmath12 and therefore @xmath1 directly from the galaxy distribution is difficult due to galaxy bias .",
    "therefore , we will also present our results in terms of two re - defined functions that are more directly connected to unbiased observables .",
    "first , we notice that weak lensing and the late isw effect are sensitive to @xmath22 and therefore it is convenient to use the combination ( 1 + ) , [ def : sigma ] while peculiar velocities are responding to @xmath11 and , thus , they determine .",
    "[ def : mu ] note that the growth of matter perturbations is also determined by the newtonian potential , and hence by @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , these transformed functions are more closely related to observations .    in the following sections we will study the evolution of matter fluctuations inside the hubble horizon .",
    "then we can use the quasi - static approximation and neglect the time derivatives of the perturbed quantities compared with the spatial derivatives .",
    "furthermore , the comoving density perturbation and the newtonian gauge density contrast are approximately equal , @xmath23 , which means we can neglect the contribution from the velocity potentials to the poisson equation .",
    "however , this is not a perfect approximation when considering dark energy perturbations as we will discuss in sec  [ sec : cde ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the large distance modification of gravity , which is necessary to explain the late - time acceleration , generally modifies gravity even on sub - horizon scales due to the introduction of a new scalar degree of freedom .",
    "this modification of gravity due to the scalar mode can be described by brans - dicke ( bd ) gravity @xcite . in the quasi - static approximation",
    "the perturbed modified einstein equations give @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the background dark matter energy density , @xmath26 is dark matter density contrast and @xmath27 is the bd scalar field . in the quasi - static approximation the bd parameter @xmath28 and newton s constant @xmath29 can be any functions of time . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath29 can be approximated by the one measured in cavendish - like experiments and the it is constant .    in general , modified gravity models that explain the late - time acceleration",
    "predict @xmath30 on sub - horizon scales today .",
    "this would contradict the solar system constraints which require @xmath31 .",
    "however , this constraint can be applied only if the bd scalar has no potential and no self - interactions .",
    "thus , in order to avoid this constraint , the bd scalar should acquire some interaction terms on small scales .",
    "generally , we expect that the bd scalar field equation is given by @xcite @xmath32 in a fourier space . here",
    "the interaction term @xmath33 can be expanded as @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "non - linear terms become important when considering non - linear clustering of dark matter and they are crucial to recover gr on non - linear scales . however , in this work we are interested in linear perturbations thus we only take into account the linear term .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])-([eq : bd_eq2 ] ) we can directly derive the functions @xmath18 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 there are two ways to recover gr .",
    "one is to take @xmath38 and the other one is to consider large scales @xmath39 . in both cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 approach unity . for @xmath40 ,",
    "there is a unique trajectory in the @xmath41 plane parameterised by @xmath42 . as discussed in the previous section , the parameters that are more closely related to observations are @xmath6 and @xmath5",
    "; see the definitions ( [ def : sigma ] ) and ( [ def : mu ] ) .",
    "we find that these parameters are given by @xmath43 interestingly , @xmath44 is the same as in gr .",
    "this is because the scalar field couples to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and it does not couple to the photon .",
    "since @xmath6 parameterises the lensing potential , which in turn determines the geodesics of photons , it is not affected by the scalar field and , thus , @xmath45 as in gr .    on the other hand",
    ", @xmath5 measures the strength of newton gravity . in order to understand the result , it is instructive to find a solution for the scalar filed @xmath27 with a localised matter source @xmath46 in the mikowski background .",
    "let us first consider the case with @xmath40 .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry , the solution for @xmath47 far away from the source in real space is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the gravitational length of the source .",
    "if @xmath50 , the scalar field mediates an attractive force . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : poisson_eq ] ) we obtain an equation for the newtonian potential @xmath51 then we can see that the scalar field adds an additional attractive force to the newtonian potential if @xmath50 and , consequently , @xmath5 becomes larger than one . on the other hand , for @xmath52 the scalar field",
    "mediates a repulsive force .",
    "this is related to the fact that for @xmath52 the scalar field becomes a ghost that has a kinetic term with the wrong sign . in this case",
    ", the scalar field suppresses the newtonian force and @xmath5 becomes smaller than one .",
    "next , let us discuss the effect of the mass",
    ". for @xmath50 the solution for the scalar field in case of a spherically symmetric source becomes @xmath53 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the compton wavelength of the scalar field . on large scales , @xmath55",
    ", the solution exponentially decays and the scalar field becomes negligible . in this case",
    "there is no scalar force and gr is recovered , so @xmath56 . on the other hand , for @xmath57 ,",
    "the effect of the mass can be neglected and we get the same result as for the massless case .",
    "thus , for @xmath58 , @xmath5 becomes scale - dependent .",
    "this bd theory contains two well known modified gravity models as special cases : @xmath59 gravity and the dgp braneworld model .",
    "firstly , in @xmath59 gravity we have @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "in this case @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath56 for @xmath39 . in @xmath59 , though , @xmath29 can be time - dependent , which effectively modifies @xmath6 and @xmath5 . however , its dependence on time is strongly constrained by observations and we can safely neglect such an effect . secondly , in the dgp model we have @xmath63 with @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the time derivative of the hubble parameter and @xmath66 is the cross - over scale , which is a parameter in this model @xcite . here",
    "@xmath40 for quasi - static perturbations .",
    "we should note that @xmath67 and @xmath68 in dgp indicating a theoretical pathology of the model @xcite .",
    "the dark energy can in principle support long - lived fluctuations @xcite . in these clustering dark energy ( cde ) models the baryons will fall into the potential wells created by both the dark matter and energy . here",
    "we consider a general dark energy fluid with a time - varying barotropic equation of state parameter , @xmath69 , and some scalar anisotropic stress @xmath70 .",
    "however , in this section we restrict the dark energy to be minimally coupled to gravity and ( dark and baryonic ) matter , which means that here @xmath71 for @xmath72 ; and we can treat the baryons and the dark matter as a single pressureless perfect fluid .    given the different physical behaviour of matter and dark energy the total density fluctuation will not be a simple linear function of @xmath26 but acquires a contribution from the dark energy . the poisson equation in cde models",
    "is then given by k^2=",
    "4g_n a^2 ( _ m_m+_de_de ) the dark energy anisotropic stress , @xmath70 , enters the second einstein constraint equation as k^2(+)=-12g_na^2(1+w_de)_de_de . because the evolution of the background energy densities in cde is not modified with respect to the sde reference , we have @xmath73 . so the definition of q in eq .",

    "let us consider the simplest massless case in the mg models described by the bd theory . in this case , as is seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mgqeta ] ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 is expressed in terms of a single parameter @xmath142 , i.e.  both are not independent quantities .",
    "if we project this constraint on the @xmath6 and @xmath5 plane , we get @xmath143 and interestingly , @xmath44 is the same as gr with varying @xmath5 only .",
    "note that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are scale independent , as the massless case is considered . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmamu ] , the mg models described by the bd theory trace a path along the direction of @xmath5 at fixed @xmath45 .    in clustering dark energy ( cde ) models , it is difficult to give physical models for dark energy perturbations . we have considered a simple toy model where the pressure perturbation is modeled as in eq .",
    "( [ dpressure ] ) . if we impose scale - independence of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we find @xmath144 and that the anisotropic stress should be related to the pressure perturbation via @xmath145",
    ". then we are left with only one free parameter , either the pressure perturbation @xmath76 or the anisotropic stress @xmath70 , thus again there is a unique path on the ( @xmath6 , @xmath5 ) plane .",
    "of course , it is possible to vary @xmath146 and @xmath70 fully independently , but then the scale independence of @xmath6 and @xmath5 is lost , or absolute fine - tuning .    in interacting dark energy ( ide ) models , no anisotropic stress is introduced with the assumption that dark energy is smooth and , thus , only @xmath1 is non - trivial .",
    "therefore , the condition @xmath147 reduces the degrees of freedom again to only one such that we have the relation = .",
    "this turns out to be quite distinct from the trajectory of the mg models as is shown in fig .",

    "= 3.truein    these examples suggest that if we can measure @xmath6 and @xmath5 from observations , the path on the ( @xmath6 , @xmath5 ) plane enables us to identify the underlying physics of the cosmic acceleration .",
    "in this paper , we proposed to parameterise the relation between the lensing potential and the matter over - densities , @xmath6 , and the dynamic relation between the newtonian potential and the matter over - densities , @xmath5 , which enable us to characterise theoretical models and constrain them with observations .",
    "if dark energy is described by a perfect fluid that is homogeneous ( smooth ) on sub - horizon scales these parameters are trivial , i.e.  @xmath45 and @xmath148 .",
    "we showed that @xmath6 and @xmath5 can depart from unity in some theoretical models ; such as modified gravity models , interacting dark energy models and clustering dark energy models .",
    "interestingly , both parameters are related to each other in an unique way depending on the underlying theory :    * with the assumption of the scale - independent evolution of perturbations , @xmath6 and @xmath5 in brans - dicke type mg models are described by a single variable , @xmath42 , which leads to a specific trajectory with @xmath45 .",
    "this comes from the fact that there is no coupling between photons and the bd scalar field . * in clustering dark energy the scale - independence of @xmath6 and @xmath5 and the simple assumption that @xmath149 lead to a constraint equation between the pressure perturbation and anisotropy stress .",
    "therefore , both @xmath6 and @xmath5 are determined by a single variable , and consequently there is a unique trajectory in the ( @xmath6 , @xmath5 ) plane . * for interacting dark energy models ,",
    "as there is no anisotropic stress induced by interactions , we have a simple relation , @xmath150 .",
    "nevertheless , a non - trivial @xmath6 is induced by the non - adiabatic scaling of the background dark matter density .",
