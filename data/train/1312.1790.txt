    "the dynamics of a classical or a quantum field drastically depends on the external boundary conditions imposed on it .",
    "the spectrum of the field could be changed with a boundary condition , and it will lead to an observable effect .",
    "casimir effect @xcite@xcite is one of such kind of phenomena . in its simplest form",
    ", the presence of two infinitely large , perfectly reflecting parallel conducting planes placed in a vacuum changes the spectral density of zero - point fluctuation of the vacuum and leads to an attractive force between the planes .",
    "this is an entirely quantum effect because the force acting between two neutral plances is equal to zero in classical electrodynamics .    since the last decade ,",
    "the casimir effect has been paid more attention due to the development of precise measurements @xcite and technological advancements .",
    "indeed , the casimir force offers new possibilities for nanotechnology , such as the actuation of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems ( mems and nems ) mediated by the quantum vacuum @xcite . however , there are some challenges since the same force could be generated by the stiction of these devices and there also a lot of work both from theoretical and experimental aspects to understand how to engineer the strength and sign of the casimir force - a repulsive force would provide an anti-``stiction '' effect @xcite . inevitably a lot of attention has been focused on the role of boundary conditions and very recently on the interplay of material properties , temperature , and geometry .",
    "some new methods have developed for computing the casimir effect between a finite number of compact objects @xcite , inside a rectangular box or cavity @xcite . when a topology of the flat spacetime was chosen to cause the helix boundary condition for a scalar field , the casimir force behaves very much like the force on a spring that obeys the hooke s law when the ratio of the pitch to the circumference of the helix is small , but in this case , the force comes from a quantum effect , so the author call it _ quantum spring _ @xcite @xcite or _ quantum anti - spring _",
    "@xcite corresponding to periodic - like and anti - periodic - like boundary condition , see also @xcite . for recent review on the casimir effect ,",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present our results for the computation of casimir energies and forces for a scalar mimicking a periodic nanostructure by means of zeta function regularization method @xcite .",
    "the nanostructure under considered could be a @xmath0 lamellar grating , which is a periodic metallic and/or dielectric structure that consist of planar layers .",
    "the @xmath1-function regularization procedure is a very powerful and elegant technique for the casimir effect .",
    "rigorous extension of the proof of epstein @xmath1-function regularization has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "vacuum polarization in the background of on a string was first considered in @xcite .",
    "the generalized @xmath1-function has many interesting applications , e.g. , in the piecewise string @xcite .",
    "similar analysis has been applied to noncommutative spacetime @xcite , monopoles @xcite , p - branes @xcite or pistons @xcite .",
    "casimir effect for a fractional boundary condition is of interest in considering , for example , the finite temperature casimir effect for a scalar field with fractional neumann conditions @xcite , while the repulsive force from fractional boundary conditions has been studied @xcite .",
    "usually , one will take the ( anti- ) periodic boundary condition for the scalar field to mimic the external boundary conditions ( such as the lamellar grating ) or some non - euclidean topologies ( like @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xmath3 however , there could be an arbitrary phase difference between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , namely , @xmath6 where the phase angle @xmath7 and it will reduce to the ( anti- ) periodic boundary condition when @xmath8 takes an ( half- ) integer value . generally , the phase could be any values besides @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the complex plane .",
    "for instance , when one considers the casimir effect in nanotubes or nanoloopes for a quantum field , @xmath11 corresponds to metallic nanotubes , while @xmath12 corresponds to semiconductor nanotubes .",
    "so , it is more reasonable and interesting to take the this kind of  quasi - periodic \" boundary condition ( [ bpcond ] ) for the scalar field and we found that the casimir force could be attractive , repulsive or vanished depends on the values of @xmath8 .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "in the next section , the calculation of the casimir energy and force under the quasi - periodic boundary condition for a massless and massive scalar field in @xmath13 dimensional spacetime will be presented . in the last section",
    ", we will discuss results and prospects for future studies .",
    "first , we consider a massless scalar field living in a flat space - time , whose dynamics is determined by the following klein - gordon equation @xmath14 which has a solution as the following @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a normalization factor . by taking the quasi - periodic boundary condition ( [ bpcond ] ) , we get its energy spectrum @xmath17^{2 }   \\,.\\ ] ] in the ground state ( vacuum state ) , each of these modes contributes an energy of @xmath18 .",
    "then the energy density of the field in @xmath13 dimensional spacetime is given by @xmath19 in order to use the @xmath1-function regularization , we define the function @xmath20 as @xmath21 for @xmath22 to make a finite result provided by the @xmath23 integration . in the following",
    "one can see that its analytic continuation to the complex @xmath24 plane is well defined at @xmath25 .",
    "so , the regularized vacuum energy could be written as @xmath26 .    by using the mathematical identity @xmath27 and the relation @xmath28 we get @xmath29 then using the following reflection relation ,",
    "see app .",
    "[ reg1 ] , @xmath30 we obtain the final results @xmath31 and @xmath32 in particular , for odd values of @xmath33 , ( @xmath34 ) , one can get @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bernoulli polynomials , see app .",
    "[ ovd ] . as an example , we take @xmath37 , then the energy density is given by @xmath38 where we have used @xmath39 . the casimir force could be derived as @xmath40 . for @xmath37 , it becomes @xmath41 and we also plot the behavior of the casimir forces in fig .  [ fig::forcend ] .",
    "the casimir force ( in unit of @xmath42 ) with respect to @xmath8 ( in unit of @xmath43rad . ) in @xmath13 dimension .",
    "here we have plotted @xmath44 corresponding to the dashed , dotdashed , solid and dotted curves respectively in the figure.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig::forcend ] , one can see that the casimir force could be attractive or repulsive depending on values of the phase angle @xmath8 and especially , when @xmath45 the casimir effect disappears .",
    "the maximum value of the repulsive force is obtained when @xmath46 , which corresponds to the anti - periodic boundary condition .",
    "[ fig::forcend ] illustrates the casimir forces in @xmath13 dimensional spacetime with @xmath47 and one can see that all of them have a maximum value when @xmath46 . actually , from eq .",
    "( [ venergy ] ) we have @xmath48 , then @xmath46 makes @xmath49 and @xmath50 , so it gets maximum value @xmath51 .    in the case of a massive scalar field",
    ", we have @xmath17^{2 } + m^{2 }   \\,.\\ ] ] and @xmath52 to use the @xmath1-function regularization , we define @xmath20 as @xmath53^{\\frac{d-1-s}{2 } }       \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } d^{d-1}k\\left(k^2 + 1\\right)^{-s/2 } \\,,\\ ] ] for @xmath22 still to make a finite result provided by the @xmath23 integration and @xmath26 . here , we have defined @xmath54 and then we have @xmath55^{\\frac{d-1-s}{2}}\\,.\\ ] ] by using the following reflection relation , see app .

    "thus , we get the force as @xmath59 , which will reduce to the expression of the force in the massless case when @xmath60 . if the mass is large , we have @xmath61 which is exponentially small .",
    "it means that the casimir force will be vanished when the mass tends to infinity .",
    "furthermore , the casimir force for a massive scalar field also gets its maximum value at @xmath46 for a given @xmath62 and the reason is the same as that in the massless case .    furthermore ,",
    "if the background topology is @xmath63 in a ( @xmath13 ) flat spacetime , one can also easily get the casimir energy density by using the same approach used above , and the result is given by @xmath64^{\\frac{d+1}{2 } } \\cos(2\\pi   \\mathbf{n}_{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{\\theta}_{k } k_{\\frac{d+1}{2}}\\bigg ( mf(n_{k},a_{k } ) \\bigg ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the function @xmath65",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the casimir effect of a scalar field under the quasi - periodic boundary condition ( [ bpcond ] ) with and without mass .",
    "we find that the casimir force could be attractive or repulsive depending on values of the phase angle and especially , when the angle takes a particular value , the casimir effect disappears .",
    "further more , in arbitrary dimensions of spacetime , the casimir force gets a maximum value when the phase angle @xmath46 , which corresponds to anti - periodic boundary condition .",
    "the exact value of @xmath8 may be dependent on the properties of the materials that are mimicked by the scalar field .",
    "so that the casimir force could be attractive or repulsive depending on which kind of materials is used in the experiment . in another way , @xmath8 could be used to characterize whether the real material is perfect periodic or not .",
    "so , the effect from the phase angle is worth further studying and we suggest to do the experiment to verify our results .    this work is supported by national science foundation of china grant nos .",
