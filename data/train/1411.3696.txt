    "computational modeling plays an increasingly important role in the characterization and understanding of a broad range of elementary chemical transformations relevant to catalytic processes .",
    "such catalytic chemical reactions can be described by microscopic kinetic models such as the coarse - grained lattice kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) method @xcite , a computational simulation of the time evolution of some stochastic process .",
    "typically , simulation of processes arising in catalytic chemistry are carried out based upon rates for adsorption , reaction , desorption , and diffusion that are obtained from experiments , density functional theory ( dft ) , and transition state theory ( tst ) .",
    "if a system exhibits significant transport , hybrid methods @xcite for heterogeneous reaction kinetics can be constructed , which combine kmc for the chemical kinetics with finite difference methods for the continuum - level heat and mass transfer .",
    "underlying all models and algorithms for determining reaction dynamics is the master equation .",
    "the master equation describes the evolution of a multivariate probability distribution function ( pdf ) for finding a surface in any given state @xcite .",
    "the master equation , however is an infinite dimensional ordinary differential equation which can not be solved exactly , and thus a number of techniques have been developed for finding approximate solutions .",
    "one class of computational methods for catalytic processes hypothesize _ ad hoc _ rate equations , derived by physical reasoning , to construct phenomenological kinetic@xcite ( pk ) models of surface processes .",
    "such pk models start from an idealized surface geometry for binding sites and site connections .",
    "for example , on a ( 110 ) idealized surface , one can define bridge and cus sites connected by a square lattice , as shown in figure [ fig : surfaces ] .",
    "the models track the probability of finding a site of given type bound to a particular molecule , and use a maximum - entropy / well - mixed assumption to reconstruct spatially correlated information .",
    "the well - mixed assumption on surfaces can often fail , and there are many examples in which a given kinetic model fits one set of data well , but fails with additional test data@xcite .",
    "there have been two methodologies that have been developed to alleviate the deficiency of the pk models : generalized phenomenological kinetic ( gpk ) models and kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulation .",
    "gpk models are similar to pk models however they add evolution equations for spatial correlations . for surface catalysis",
    ", the gpk framework was introduced in the 1990 s by mai , kuzovkov , and von niessen and others @xcite , and since then this work has both been extended @xcite and applied @xcite in a variety of ways .",
    "the primary idea behind these works is to present nested sets of kinetic equations for the probability of finding a collection of @xmath0 surface sites in a particular configuration .",
    "the dynamics for the @xmath0 collections can only be determined exactly if the state of the @xmath1 collections are known , which is analogous to the bbgky hierarchy of statistical physics . in principle",
    "this leads to an infinite system of equations . in practice",
    "the nested chain is approximated through a truncation closure at some level in the hierarchy .    despite the advances in gpk modeling , kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations are now often the method of choice that is used to determine and verify the surface dynamics and steady state values in surface catalysis problems @xcite .",
    "kmc algorithms are stochastic realizations of the surface dynamics that probabilistically update the state of some surface with large but finite size .",
    "the advantage of kmc algorithms when compared to pk models is demonstrated in ref . ,",
    "in which the authors demonstrate the break down of pk models when compared to kmc predictions .",
    "kmc simulations are , however , far more expensive than both pk and low level gpk models , and rely on slow statistical averaging for predicting desired observable quantities .",
    "because the computational cost associated with kmc simulations is significantly larger than low level hierarchy members of gpk models , it is worth investigating why the kmc simulations have become the method of choice when determining solutions to the master equation dynamics .",
    "possible motivations include : ( 1 ) the simplicity of kmc algorithms , ( 2 ) advances in computational power that make kmc simulations feasible , and ( 3 ) straight forward convergence testing of kmc predictions . elaborating on point ( 3 ) , kmc simulations allow for convergence tests by taking larger surface domains and more statistical samples while using the same implementation , whereas gpk convergence tests require inclusion of new elements within the hierarchy , with the associated additional coding effort .",
    "we know of no work ( see , for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) in which the nested hierarchy is built beyond time evolution of pair correlations ; in these works triplet correlations are approximated from pairwise information .",
    "the problem of formulating a general procedure to construct higher - order hierarchy truncations is still unsolved .",
    "this means that although gpk techniques may be used to approximate the master equation , there is no methodology to test if this approximation has converged to the correct dynamics other than comparing the results with kmc simulation .",
    "if gpk models are to become viable techniques in determining accurate approximations to the master equation , there must come along with them a generalized methodology for constructing arbitrary elements of the hierarchy so that convergence may be examined . as shown in the supplemental material@xcite ,",
    "it is possible to obtain an inconsistent model through an inappropriate triplet closure , further highlighting the need for a formulation of gpk models that incorporates a method for testing convergence of successive truncations of the approximation hierarchy .    to accomplish this formulation ,",
    "the present work will take a slightly different approach to the nested schemes .",
    "similarly to the nested gpk schemes we will also arrive at a generalized hierarchy of phenomenological kinetic models .",
    "our methodology begins with the observation that the simple pk models are probability distributions of a @xmath2 group of sites on the surface .",
    "we will denote an arbitrary grouping of sites sites as a ` tile ' on the surface and seek to determine the kinetics of the probability distribution of surface states on a tile .",
    "we note that the @xmath3 tiling is identical to the nested scheme presented in ref .",
    "( for surfaces made up of a single site type ) , and reiterate that the triplet nested scheme , mentioned but not studied in ref .",
    ", is different than the @xmath4 tiling scheme ( see the supplemental material @xcite ) .",
    "the novel aspect of the present work will be the generalized construction of members of the hierarchy which will provide consistent and increasingly accurate dynamics for larger tilings .",
    "such a framework has the potential to allow the gpk models not to rely on kmc simulation to test for accuracy , but rather to remain self contained by comparing the results from smaller tile dynamics to larger tile dynamics , with the hope that the scheme will converge with significant computational savings .",
    "we begin this work by exposing the formalism of the tiling idea in section 2 , and provide two examples of how to construct a set of odes within the tiling framework .",
    "the second of these examples considers the oxidation of co on a face centered cubic structure s ( 110 ) surface ( also considered in refs . ) . in section 3",
    "we provide numerical evidence that supports and verifies the formalism based on a 1d and 2d uniform surface with a square lattice . in section 4",
    "we test the kinetic models resulting from site ( @xmath5 ) and pair ( @xmath6 ) tilings for the surface catalysis problem of co oxidation demonstrated in refs .",
    "e demonstrate that the pair tiling significantly reduces errors made in the pk formalism of ref . .",
    "we next examine the idea of having a mixed tiling scheme and show that improved accuracy may be efficiently obtained within this mixed tiling hierarchy .",
    "we present results for this mixed tiling and demonstrate that it better captures the dynamics predicted by kmc simulation , providing the possibility for a search algorithm in the tiling hierarchy that remains computationally inexpensive .",
    "consider a surface @xmath7 made of @xmath8 sites , each labeled as particular type from a set @xmath9 .",
    "for example on an idealized ( 100 ) surface there are atop , bridge , and 4-fold hollow sites and so @xmath10atop , bridge , hollow@xmath11 , whereas on a ( 110 ) crystal surface there are bridge and cus site types and so @xmath10bridge , cus@xmath11 ( see figure [ fig : surfaces ] ) .",
    "each site on the surface may be in a particular state and we will call the set of possible states @xmath12 . for example , in the surface oxidation of co , co and o@xmath13 adsorb and desorb on the surface@xcite .",
    "co remains bonded upon adsorption whereas o@xmath13 dissociates , two adjacent sites will become occupied by a single o molecule . in this case",
    "the set of possible site states is @xmath14 , which corresponds to an unoccupied site , a site occupied by o , and a site occupied by co , respectively .",
    "supposing that we start with an surface , the master equation is formulated with a known transition matrix , @xmath15 , which prescribes the rate at which one particular system state transitions to another and may be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the probability of the surface being in state @xmath18 , and a state @xmath19 is an @xmath8 vector describing the state of each site ( for example , refs . ) . in the discrete",
    "setting of surface reactions , each site may be in one of @xmath20 states , where @xmath21 represents the cardinality of a set .",
    "the master equation yields a set of @xmath22 ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . in the limit of @xmath23 ,",
    "the kinetics are described by a denumerable but infinite dimensional ode ( so long as @xmath24 ) , an intractable problem that requires truncation along with periodic boundary conditions to become solvable . even for finite values of @xmath25 , the size of state space",
    "is often intractably large for realistic choices of @xmath25 , and thus instead of solving the master equation directly , a stochastic realization of the surface dynamics is often considered by using kinetic monte carlo algorithms ( see for example , ref . ) .    in the present work",
    ", we restrict attention to translationally invariant systems and hypothesize that they exhibit a finite correlation length captured in an @xmath26 subdomain we refer to as a tile within the overall @xmath27 domain , ( @xmath28 ) . as suggested by the notation",
    ", we will consider square lattices in the present work , however see no reason why the theory can not be generalized to different lattice geometries . under these assumptions , a truncated bbgky hierarchy for approximation of the master equation",
    "can be obtained based on the dynamics of tiles that capture correlation effects .",
    "in essence the procedure is yet another phenomenological closure , but of increasing accuracy with increasing tile size .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to construction of a stochastic reduced model of size @xmath26 to approximate the behavior of a larger @xmath27 system .",
    "the formal analysis of the approximation error will be presented in follow - on work . here",
    "we present the overall procedure and demonstrate the practical efficiency of the approach for surface co catalysis .",
    "consider a rectangular tile of size @xmath29 that covers @xmath29 contiguous sites within the overall @xmath27 surface , @xmath30 ( see figure 1 for an illustration of @xmath31 and @xmath32 tiles ) .",
    "sites may be of various types ( e.g. , bridge or cus , cf .",
    "1 ) ; let @xmath9 denote the set of site types ( distinct from @xmath12 , the set of site states ) . for some chosen @xmath26 tile , let @xmath33 denote the set of possible tile types . this is usually a small subset of @xmath34 fixed by the overall lattice construction .",
    "for example , in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice with repeating @xmath35 sites , the possible @xmath36 tiles are @xmath37 , a subset with four elements of the eight - element set @xmath34 .",
    "it is necessary to distinguish tiles of the same type that have different neighbors .",
    "for example in the 1d lattice @xmath38 , the are two variants of the @xmath32 bb tile , one with @xmath39 neighbors , the other with @xmath40 neighbors .",
    "we therefore introduce @xmath41 as the set of tile types with distinct positions in the lattice .",
    "having categorized each tile @xmath42 , we may denote the state of the tile , @xmath43 , as @xmath44 , with underlying site types @xmath45 .",
    "we may then assign a discrete pdf of finding tile @xmath46 in state @xmath47 , and denote this probability as @xmath48 .",
    "due to the assumed translational invariance of the system , all tiles identified with tile type @xmath46 in the lattice are assumed to have identical probability distributions throughout time .",
    "we seek to approximate these dynamics by assuming knowledge only up to a given tiling on the system , which will hold information of the pdf s @xmath49 .",
    "each pdf has a domain of size @xmath50 , there are @xmath51 pdf s to track , and thus the goal is to reduce the large or infinite dimensional master equation ( equation [ eqn : fullcme ] ) to a @xmath52 dimensional set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "because @xmath53 in many interesting cases ( such as the ( 110 ) and ( 100 ) surfaces described above ) , the dimensionality of the ode will often be equivalent to @xmath54 .    to achieve this approximation , we first note that given an arbitrary tile located on the @xmath8 surface with site type geometry @xmath45 and lattice position described by @xmath42 , we may evaluate the dynamics of the discrete pdf over the state space on this tile based on the full description of the master equation ( equation [ eqn : fullcme ] )",
    ". below we will refer to ` the tile @xmath46 , ' by which we mean an arbitrary choice from all the similar tiles @xmath46 from the full @xmath8 system .",
    "we reiterate that the reason we may choose any arbitrary @xmath46 is due to the assumed translational invariance of the system . to approximate the dynamics of the pdf @xmath55 on a reduced system",
    ", we decompose the transition matrix @xmath56 into a sum of three matrices : a matrix that only changes site states within the tile @xmath46 , @xmath57 , a matrix that changes site states both within the tile and exterior to the tile , @xmath58 , and a matrix that does not change any of the site states within the tile , @xmath59 .",
    "thus we write @xmath60 the second matrix , @xmath58 is further decomposed by considering collections of sites that include an arbitrary number of exterior sites along with all of the sites in the tile @xmath46 , and in which the site states of @xmath46 are specified .",
    "any one of these collections will be denoted @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a collection of sites that includes the sites in @xmath46 , and @xmath63 represents the states of each site in the collection @xmath62 .",
    "we then define @xmath64 to be the matrix that encodes transitions such that ( i ) at least one site in the tile @xmath46 changes state , ( ii ) _ every _ site exterior to the tile @xmath46 in @xmath62 is changed , and ( iii ) _ no _ site exterior to @xmath62 changes state .",
    "summing over all possible choices of @xmath61 , both in selection of @xmath62 and the choice of states @xmath63 , we then further decompose @xmath65 to be @xmath66    because we are only interested in the local events , we then average the rate of each transition type in the tile going from state @xmath67 to state @xmath68 ( both states in @xmath69 ) .",
    "we describe these averaged transitions rates as    [ eqn : meanfield ] @xmath70 @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the set of all possible states of the collection of sites @xmath73 , @xmath46 is the tile that may also be thought of as a set of sites on the surface @xmath7 that comprise the tile , and @xmath74 is a choice of @xmath63 that is constrained so that the states on the tile are described by @xmath67 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath75 in the interior of each sum are the elements of the transition matrix that begin in state @xmath67 on the subset @xmath76 and finish in state @xmath68 on @xmath46 , and all exterior states in @xmath77 remain fixed in state @xmath78",
    ". the last condition will be trivially satisfied based on the definitions of the matrix decomposition above .",
    "finally the sum is weighted by the conditional probability that the system will be in state @xmath78 given that we know either the state of the tile @xmath79 or the state of tile along with the external sites specified by @xmath80 and the discrete pdf s of all tiles .",
    "we then may define new transition matrices @xmath81 and @xmath82 , all of which have dimension @xmath83 .",
    "taken together , these matrices represent a mean field theory that accounts only for the sites that change within the tilings , averaging the influences of the system states that do not change with a given transition ; we note that in general , the reduced matrices will depend non - trivially on the pdf s of the tiling , however in the current work we will primarily focus on systems that have transition rates independent of the state of sites that do not change states . therefore ,",
    "having a fixed @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we assume that @xmath86 for all @xmath87 , which means that we may arbitrarily assign any of these elements to the reduced matrix :    [ eqn : simpmeanfield ] @xmath88 @xmath89    having defined the transition rates on tiles , the master equation approximation is @xmath90 the first summation on the right hand side represents tile state changes that occur entirely within tile .",
    "the second and third summation capture state changes dependent on neighboring tiles being in a specific state .    to close the set of equations given in equation [ eqn : mastertruncate ] ,",
    "the conditional probabilities @xmath91 must be computed .",
    "these are the probabilities that the neighboring sites of @xmath92 are in state @xmath63 when the tile is in state @xmath47 . in this work",
    "we consider square lattices in which only a single site exterior to the tile @xmath46 changes state upon a reaction .",
    "we note that the second assumption is common as many model reactions effect either one or two sites , but often no more . with this",
    "said , we note that it is possible to formally determine equation [ eqn : condprob ] with the both assumptions relaxed , however such cases are beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "next we say that if there is no tile that covers both the exterior changed tile and the interior changed tile , then the probability of finding the exterior tile in a given state is independent of the interior state . along with the consistency criteria presented below ( see section [ sec : constraint ] )",
    ", this will provide a robust method for determining the probability of finding the exterior site in the desired state .",
    "as an example of the calculation of the conditional probability ( equation [ eqn : condprob ] ) , consider the @xmath93 tile shown in figure [ fig : closure ] along with a reaction that changes the states of the two sites ( 5,2 ) , ( 5,3 ) within the tile , but requires a neighbor site outside the tile to be in a specific state .",
    "we must determine the probability of finding the overall initial state of both tile and neighboring sites that allows for the reaction to occur .",
    "this is computed by summation of the probability of all partially overlapping tiles that have consistent states .     for the transition to be able to occur .",
    "we integrate over all states of a secondary overlapping tile , represented with thin solid grey lines , excluding the exterior tile site that will change state.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]   for the transition to be able to occur .",
    "we integrate over all states of a secondary overlapping tile , represented with thin solid grey lines , excluding the exterior tile site that will change state.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    to obtain a precise computational statement of the required conditional probability , consider  the tile @xmath94 , a tile of type @xmath95 , in initial state @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 denote both the site type and state at position @xmath98 within the tile , @xmath99 , @xmath100 . consider a state transition at site @xmath98 that requires a neighbor site @xmath101 situated outside the tile to be in state @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath103 denote the subset of tiles that have the same site types and states as tile @xmath94 in the overlap region after translation by @xmath104 @xmath105 the probability of a translated tile to have the correct overlap site types and states is @xmath106 within @xmath107 there exists a further subset @xmath108 that has the required state @xmath102 at position @xmath109 @xmath110 the conditional probability from ( 7 ) is given by @xmath111 with numerator simply expression the further restriction on the required @xmath102 state at @xmath109 .",
    "this methodology provides a robust method for closing the approximated dynamics of the master equation with the reduced tiling system provided that only one site exterior to a given tile changes with arbitrarily many interior sites based on all given transitions . as we have mentioned above , it is also straight forward to generalize this framework to cases in which multiple interior sites , or multiple exterior sites transition , however such reactions are not considered in the present work and we forgo this discussion presently .",
    "having established a reduced system with corresponding equations for arbitrary rectangular tilings , we next mention some simple ways in which we can take advantage of rotational symmetries on the lattice , and then introduce a generalization to a mixed tiling scheme . following this exposition , to ensure both the ode written in equation [ eqn : mastertruncate ] , and the generalization presented below are self - consistent , we state two consistency criteria . from here",
    ", we present a simple example , and then several concrete examples of surface catalysis , which will be used below in numerical tests .      up to this point , we have discussed tilings with fixed orientations .",
    "certain lattices , however , contain symmetries that may be used to obtain higher range spatial correlations without increasing the dimension of the set of corresponding equations . in the ( 100 ) crystal",
    "above , for example , there are four rotational symmetries of the lattice found by rotation of @xmath112 radians .",
    "thus we expect that for each @xmath113 tile , there is a corresponding @xmath114 tile with an equivalent pdf over site states under rotation .",
    "therefore , in reconstructing the conditional probabilities used in conjunction with @xmath115 , we assume that we have both @xmath113 and @xmath114 tiling types . in the case",
    ", this may lead to more detail in spatial correlations along both lattice directions , and thus a more accurate method with no additional cost .",
    "we may also consider the ( 110 ) surface described above that only has two rotational symmetries found by rotation of @xmath117 radians . in this case , considering @xmath118 tiles would provide us with spatial correlations along cus - cus or bridge - bridge sites but we would be assuming independence in the cus - bridge direction .",
    "similarly a @xmath119 tiling would retain spatially correlated data in the bridge - cus direction , but not along bridge - bridge or cus - cus networks . to get around this",
    "we could consider @xmath113 tiling , however the number of equations would grow exponentially , from an @xmath120 to a @xmath121 dimensional ode , where @xmath122 is the tile set when considering a @xmath113 tiling . in the case of the ( 110 ) surface @xmath123 , and",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath125 are equal to @xmath126 if @xmath127 is even and @xmath128 if @xmath127 is odd .",
    "instead we may consider mixed tilings , which is to say we consider the system constructed when considering the pdf s on @xmath129 and @xmath119 tiles , which causes the system to grow from a @xmath120 to a @xmath130 dimensional ode ( so long as @xmath131 ) . to close the conditional probabilities we utilize an identical method to that listed above",
    ", however note that in some cases we will be able to choose either an @xmath29 or @xmath132 overlapping tile that satisfies the above criteria . to make the choice unique",
    "we will first require that the chosen tile containing both the interior and exterior sites that will transition , contain a maximal number of overlapping sites . in the case that this choice is not unique",
    ", we require the sum of the radial distance between the overlapping tiles and the interior transitioning tiles to be minimal , where we define the radial distance in the usual sense ( i.e. the distance between site @xmath133 and @xmath134 is @xmath135 ) .",
    "we conjecture but are not certain that this criteria will provide a unique tiling choice , but mention that it does in all the cases we have considered below .    with all of the methods listed above",
    ", we must ensure that several constraints are met to ensure the system is consistent .",
    "we expose these constraints in the following subsection .",
    "care must be taken to ensure that certain constraints are obeyed by any of the resulting reduced systems described above .",
    "for one , a system must be initialized to have normalized pdf s over each tile .",
    "analytically , the pdf s will trivially be normalized throughout all time , since what is added to one state is taken away from another .",
    "next all lower dimensional projections must be well defined . by this",
    "we mean that lower dimensional projections must agree between ( i ) different tiles @xmath42 and ( ii ) within a given tiling .",
    "for example , suppose we have a mixed @xmath3 and @xmath136 tiling on a ( 110 ) surface as described above , suppose we have a bridge - bridge tile , @xmath46 and a bridge - cus tile @xmath137 .",
    "we note that in the @xmath2 tiling system all bridge and cus sites are identical on the lattice and thus the probability of finding a bridge site in a particular state must be the same no mater how it is determined .",
    "this means that we must have    [ eqn : constraints ] @xmath138 @xmath139    we conjecture that systems will be well behaved for rectangular @xmath29 tiling systems and for mixed tiling schemes . we note that we have numerically verified that all systems mentioned below satisfy the above criteria for a variety of test cases and projections . from this point on",
    "we will assume all tiling systems are mixed , i.e. saying that we are working with a @xmath140 tiling system will mean that we are working with a mixed @xmath3 and @xmath136 tiling system .    in general , equation [ eqn : mastertruncate ] may be difficult to work with explicitly , however we will show that in several relevant problems it simplifies to a corresponding hierarchy of odes that can be easily coded into a computational algorithm .",
    "we illustrate the above concepts with a simple example .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is comprised of two sites each of which is identical , and each of which can be in states @xmath141 .",
    "the state space is then @xmath142 .",
    "the transition matrix is chosen as @xmath143 which states that a site in state 0 can transition to state 1 , but not the other way around , and that the rate with which this happens depends on the state of the other site .",
    "the four dimensional system may be written as @xmath144 suppose we choose a @xmath2 tiling and wish to determine the reduced dynamics .",
    "there is only one type of tile as both sites share identical dynamics .",
    "we find that @xmath145 ( and hence @xmath146 ) as there are no reactions effecting both sites and @xmath147 corresponding to the state space @xmath148 , which leads to dynamics given by @xmath149      we next demonstrate how to construct approximated systems with a more realistic example . to do this , we consider the ( 110 ) surface made up of bridge and cus sites ( see figure [ fig : surfaces ] ) . each bridge site is connected to two other bridge sites and two cus sites .",
    "we suppose that we know a collection of surface transitions and each of their rates . in the following example we consider approximate dynamics of co oxidation for @xmath2 and @xmath3 tilings with the collection of possible events that can generate state changes on the surface , given as    [ eqn : surfacereactions ] @xmath150    where the subscripts @xmath84 represent the site types being occupied and the subscript @xmath151 represents molecules in the gas phase disconnected from the surface .",
    "the only additional constraint is that sites must be adjacent on the lattice for transitions involving two sites to occur .",
    "the classification ads / des denotes adsorption and desorption events ( depending on the reaction direction ) and  surf rxn denotes surface reactions .",
    "we classify the transitions as site transitions ( e.g. equation [ eqn : siter ] ) or pair transitions ( e.g. equation[eqn : pairri ] ) .",
    "we may also define diffusion events as pair transitions that appear as @xmath152 but we do not consider these events in the present work .",
    "the reason for this omission is four - fold : ( 1 ) near steady state the systems we examine have very low probability of being in the empty state and thus diffusion in these regimes will not heavily influence the system , ( 2 ) many previous studies that have explored this work have also left out the consideration of diffusion ( see for example refs ) and thus omitting diffusion will make our work more comparable to these studies , ( 3 ) we have run simulations where we have included diffusion ( but have omitted the results from this presentation ) and find that the system dynamics are nearly identical to the case without diffusion , and ( 4 ) we note that diffusion tends to mix systems and thus smaller elements of the hierarchy may lead to accurate results in cases where diffusion is important ; thus we expect that showing that the hierarchy is still effective when diffusion is not relevant should lead to a more stringent verification of our method .",
    "there are two possible site types ( @xmath10bridge , cus@xmath11 ) , and each may be in one of the three possible states , @xmath153 , o , co@xmath11 .",
    "we begin with a @xmath2 tiling and show that this tiling leads to a similar set of odes to the pk model described in ref . .",
    "there are two possible tilings , @xmath46 , representing a covering of each site type .",
    "we shall describe the set of tilings as @xmath154[b ] , [ c]@xmath11 for bridge and cus sites respectively .",
    "we next wish to determine an approximate master equation describing the probability of finding each particular site in a certain state .",
    "following the formalism of the previous section , the only possible interior transition in each tile is the site transition ( equation [ eqn : siter ] ) , and the other transitions enter by the second and third terms in equation [ eqn : mastertruncate ] .",
    "the mixed interior / exterior terms are closed via equation [ eqn : closure ] .",
    "each transition occurs stochastically with an exponential distribution in time ; this implies that taking a time step of @xmath155 a single event occurs with probability proportional to @xmath155 .",
    "multiple events are considered independent and thus occur with probability proportional to @xmath156 . in the limit as @xmath157",
    ", these terms will vanish leaving a simple transition matrix that only describes events that generate state changes on a site or two adjacent sites via the site and pair transitions listed above , respectively , with transition rates that are assumed to be independent of the sites that are not effected by the transition .",
    "this observation greatly reduces the space of possible choices @xmath62 , and allows us to use the reduction presented in equations [ eqn : inmatrxreduct ] and [ eqn : outmatrxreduct ] .",

    "we have also shown that the methods quickly lead improvements on a realistic example of oxidation of co on ruo@xmath13(110 ) , and have observed that a modest improvement to @xmath3 tilings captures many of the important system dynamics within the parameters considered .",
    "although the @xmath245 ) tiling scheme is similar to the gpk model presented in ref . , the present work , to our knowledge , is the first to explore the surface reaction dynamics of gpk equations within the context of a non - uniform or non - randomized lattice .",
    "furthermore , we have introduced the concept of a mixed tiling , and have shown that mixed tiling schemes can lead to a more accurate description of the dynamics of the master equation .",
    "the ability to extend models to larger tilings provides a means to hypothesis test pk models on smaller tiles , as well hypothesis test gpk models by examine larger tilings . in any pursuit",
    "in which one hypothesizes that a gpk model provides a suitable model , the current methodology provides a fast method to justify this choice of model by testing this hypothesis with extended tiling systems",
    ". should the dynamics change significantly between the smaller and larger tilings , we can reject the method . although this provides a sufficient tool for hypothesis rejection",
    ", it is an open and interesting question to ask that if we do not see improvement between a smaller and larger tiling system , does this mean that the method has converged or are there local plateaus ( i.e. is the condition necessary ) ?",
    "for example , although we did not see convergence in the mixed tiling scheme on the realistic example , we did see progressively more accurate schemes when both spatial directions were accounted for in the tiling scheme .",
    "a rigorous framework describing the situations in which the tiling schemes will converge to the appropriate dynamics will be in an important next step in developing this work .",
    "this hierarchy of gpk models may also be used to fit parameters from observed experimental data .",
    "these parameter estimates can be similarly tested by examining larger tilings .",
    "if the parameters change , we can conclude that longer range spatial correlations play a significant role in the surface dynamics , however if the parameter estimates do not change it is still an open question as to whether or not we can conclude these are accurate surface parameters .",
    "if this question can be answered in the affirmative , we can then use transition state theory ( tst ) to predict energy barriers and energy differences between bound and unbound site states , and also predict transition rates over all temperatures .",
    "the two open questions presented in this and the above paragraph will be the subject of a future investigation .     we note that it is possible for the gpk model to be too computationally expensive in order to select a corresponding tile that will guarantee convergence as is demonstrated in the 2d uniform surface example of section [ sec : idbc ] . to potentially resolve this issue",
    "we have noted the possibility of introducing mixed tiling surfaces and have demonstrated the possibility for improved accuracy .",
    "we propose the idea that a mixed tiling search algorithm may be able to determine appropriate directions on which to increase a mixed tiling scheme , but save such a development for future work .",
    "we also note that speed - ups beyond what we have presented in the present work are possible by ( 1 ) solving resulting odes with a quasi - newton method rather than via direct integration of the odes from some initial condition , ( 2 ) by utilizing symbolic programing to reduce the number of degrees of freedom via the consistency restraints found in section [ sec : constraint ] .",
    "we save both of these tasks for future work , but note that we have begun to develop a code base for this algorithm and an example of the code is available at https://github.com/gjherschlag/mixedtiling_eg .",
    "these speedups and savings in memory will allow us to search larger elements of the hierarchy that may allow us to reach convergence for a wide class of problems with large computational savings .",
    "the methodology here has been tested in the context of constant rate coefficients so that equations [ eqn : inmatrxgenreduct ] and [ eqn : outmatrxgenreduct ] may be simplified to equations [ eqn : inmatrxreduct ] and [ eqn : outmatrxreduct ] . in many interesting catalysis reactions ,",
    "rate reactions will change based on local spatial correlations .",
    "although we have not investigated such mechanisms in the current work , it will be interesting to examine methods to reconstruct longer range spatial correlations that may be used to predict variable rate equations based on the current state of the tilings .",
    "we must ensure that all models will be consistent based on the ideas presented in section [ sec : constraint ] . in the current work we have not attempted to prove several natural propositions that have arisen , such as finding conditions for when a tiling scheme will be consistent . for example , the idea of mixed tilings raises an interesting mathematical question as to what type of tilings will lead to consistent dynamics .",
    "the triplet scheme that fails in the supplementary notes is a kind of mixed tiling scheme that leads to inconsistent dynamics@xcite , whereas the mixed tiling scheme presented in section [ sec : ruo2 ] leads to consistent dynamics ( tested numerically ) .",
    "we conjecture that convex tilings will be necessary for consistent mixed tiling dynamics but save such investigation for future work .",
    "we note that even if the inconsistencies of the previous gpk models could be handled , these equations are typically formulated in a system of odes coupled to an approximate pde that accounts for spatial correlations . for a member of these hierarchies considering correlations of @xmath127 sites",
    ", there must be @xmath127 pdes that must be solved ( or the number of independent combinations of states considering @xmath127 sites ; see for example ) ; compounding this complexity is the issue of regularized , anisotropic lattices as we have examined in the example above on ruo@xmath13 which would lead to a two dimensional pde for each collection of state variables . although it is clear that in order for convergence to be achieved , less sites must be considered in a theoretically corrected von niessen hierarchy than in the one presented in the current work , it is unclear which method would be more computationally efficient to solve due to the addition of the ( potentially anisotropic ) pde .",
    "we have presented a generalized framework in terms of surface kinetics on square lattices .",
    "the work immediately extends to three dimensional reaction networks and may extend to more general lattices and tiling structures .",
    "there are many other models that take the same form of pk models such as susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) models and other ecological models ; indeed , pairwise models corresponding to @xmath3 tilings along with pairwise approximations for long range pairs have been examined in many instances @xcite and it will be interesting to examine whether the more generalized framework presented in the current work will lead to more accurate modeling while retaining efficiency .",

    "<S> the hierarchy is a set of ordinary differential equations that considers spatial correlations of varying lattice distance ; the assumption is that the full system will have finite spatial correlations and thus the behavior of the models within the hierarchy will approach that of the full system . </S>",
    "<S> we provide evidence of this convergence in the context of one- and two - dimensional numerical examples . </S>",
    "<S> lower levels within the hierarchy that consider shorter spatial correlations , are shown to be up to three orders of magnitude faster than traditional kinetic monte carlo methods ( kmc ) for one - dimensional systems , while predicting similar system dynamics and steady states as kmc methods . </S>",
    "<S> we then test the hierarchy on a two - dimensional model for the oxidation of co on ruo2(110 ) , showing that low - order truncations of the hierarchy efficiently capture the essential system dynamics . by considering sequences of models in the hierarchy that account for longer spatial correlations , </S>",
    "<S> successive model predictions may be used to establish empirical approximation of error estimates </S>",
    "<S> . the hierarchy may be thought of as a class of generalized phenomenological kinetic models since each element of the hierarchy approximates the master equation and the lowest level in the hierarchy is identical to a simple existing phenomenological kinetic models . </S>"
