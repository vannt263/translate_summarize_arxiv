    "the knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) of pure neutron matter is an important bridge between the symmetry energy , and neutron star properties .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath0 is the difference of nuclear matter and neutron matter energy , it gives the energy cost of the isospin - asymmetry in the homogeneous nucleonic matter . in the last few years",
    "the study of @xmath0 has received considerable attention ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent experimental / theoretical review ) .",
    "the role of the symmetry energy is essential to understand the mechanism of stability of very - neutron rich nuclei , but it is also related to many phenomena occurring in neutron stars .",
    "the stability of matter inside neutron stars is very sensitive to @xmath0 and its first derivative . around saturation density ,",
    "neutrons tend to decay to protons through the @xmath1-decay , and the cooling of neutron stars is strongly connected to the proton / neutron ratio as a function of the density .",
    "this ratio is mainly governed by the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of the density .    the inner crust of neutron stars , where the density is a fraction of nuclear densities , is mostly composed of neutrons surrounding a matter made of extremely - neutron rich nuclei that , depending on the density , may exhibit very different phases and properties .",
    "the extremely rich phase diagram of the neutron crustal matter is strongly related to the role of @xmath0 .",
    "for example it governs the phase - transition between the crust and the core  @xcite and @xmath2-mode instability  @xcite .",
    "the study of the eos is particularly difficult because neutron matter is one of the most strongly - interacting fermionic systems .",
    "neutron matter is often modeled by density functionals .",
    "traditional skyrme models ( see for example ref . @xcite and references therein ) and relativistic mean - field models ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) are two general classes of density functional theories .",
    "recently , a new methods based on microscopic nuclear hamiltonians obtained from chiral effective field theories have been proposed .",
    "these nuclear forces are obtained following a systematic expansion in terms of momenta of the relevant degrees of freedom , and fit the nucleon - nucleon scattering data  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear hamiltonian is then adjusted using renormalization group techniques to make the calculation perturbative  @xcite .",
    "new induced terms generated trough the renormalization scheme have not yet been included though .",
    "these effects , as well as non - perturbative effects of three- and four - body forces , could be important  @xcite .",
    "the third class of these calculations uses nuclear potentials , like argonne and urbana / illinois forces , that reproduces two - body scattering and properties of light nuclei with very high precision  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the interaction has small non - local terms , giving the potentials a hard core . in this case calculations",
    "can be performed in a non - perturbative framework , and the strong correlations are solved by using correlated wave functions . in this paper",
    "we present results based on quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods .",
    "qmc methods have proven to be a very powerful tool to accurately study properties of light nuclei  @xcite and nuclear matter  @xcite in a very similar way .",
    "they provide the unique technique to date to consistently study nuclear systems of different kind , both inhomogeneous and homogeneous matter , with the same accuracy and using the same hamiltonians .",
    "other techniques have been used to study nuclear and neutron matter and the symmetry energy based on brueckner - hartree - fock theory ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in our model , neutrons are non - relativistic point - like particles interacting via two- and three - body forces : @xmath3 the two body - potential that we use is the argonne av8  @xcite , that is a simplified form of the argonne av18  @xcite .",
    "although simpler to use in qmc calculations , the av8 provides almost the same accuracy as av18 in fitting nn scattering data .",
    "the three - body force is not as well constrained as the nn interaction , but its inclusion in realistic nuclear hamiltonians is important to correctly describe the binding energy of light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "note that this is not necessary if phenomenological forces , like skyrme or gogny , or methods based on relativistic mean - field theory are used .",
    "the urbana ix ( uix ) three - body force has been originally proposed in combination with the argonne av18 and av8  @xcite .",
    "although it slightly underbinds the energy of light nuclei , it has been extensively used to study the equation of state of nuclear and neutron matter  @xcite .",
    "the illinois forces have been introduced to improve the description of both ground- and excited - states of light nuclei , showing an excellent accuracy  @xcite , but it produces an unphysical overbinding in pure neutron systems  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall present a study of the neutron matter eos based on different models of three - neutron force giving specific values of the symmetry energy .",
    "we solve the many - body ground - state using the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) originally introduced by schmidt and fantoni  @xcite .",
    "the main idea of qmc methods is to evolve a many - body wave function in imaginary - time : @xmath4\\psi_v \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a variational ansatz , and @xmath6 is the hamiltonian of the system . in the limit of @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath8 approaches the ground - state of @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution in imaginary - time is performed by sampling configurations of the system using monte carlo techniques , and expectation values are evaluated over the sampled configurations . for more details see for example refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) provided to be extremely accurate to study properties of light nuclei .",
    "the variational wave function includes all the possible spin / isospin states of nucleons and it provides a good variational ansatz to start the projection in the imaginary - time .",
    "the exponential growing of this states limits the calculation to the @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the afdmc method does not explicitly include all the spin / isospin states in the wave function , but they are instead sampled using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",
    "the calculation can be then extended up to many neutrons , making the simulation of homogeneous matter possible .",
    "the afdmc has proven to be very accurate when compared to gfmc calculation of energies of neutrons confined in an external potential  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry energy is defined as the difference between pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the energy of nuclear matter is often expressed as an expansion in even powers of the isospin - asymmetry @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy per particle , @xmath12 is the proton fraction , @xmath13 is the density of the system , @xmath14 are coefficients multiplying the isospin asymmetry terms @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the energy of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath0 is given by @xmath17 the energy at saturation of symmetric nuclear matter extrapolated from the binding energy of heavy nuclei is @xmath18 mev , where @xmath19 @xmath20 is the saturation density .",
    "the symmetry energy around saturation @xmath21 can be expanded as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is related to the slope of @xmath0 . by combining the above equations",
    ", we can easily relate the symmetry energy to the eos of pure neutron matter at density close to @xmath21 .",
    "in this section we present qmc results for pure neutron matter .",
    "there are several reasons to focus on pure neutron matter .",
    "first , the three - body interaction is non - zero only in the @xmath24 isospin - channel ( @xmath25 is the total isospin of three - nucleons ) , while in the presence of protons there are also contributions in @xmath26 .",
    "the latter term is the dominant one in nuclei , and only weakly accessible by studying properties of nuclei .",
    "second , the eos of pure neutron matter is closely related to the structure of neutron stars .",
    "( 32 and 33.7 mev respectively ) , and are obtained by using several models of three - neutron force . in the inset",
    "we show the value of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath27 obtained by fitting the eos .",
    "the figure is taken from ref .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we present several eos obtained using different models of three - neutron force in fig .  [ fig : eos ] .",
    "the two solid lines correspond to the eos calculated using the nn potential alone and including the uix three - body force  @xcite .",
    "the effect of using different models of three - neutron force is clear in the two bands , where the high density behavior is showed up to about @xmath28 . at such high density ,",
    "the various models giving the same symmetry energy at saturation produce an uncertainty to the eos of about 20 mev .",
    "the eos obtained using qmc can be conveniently fit using the following functional  @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath11 is the energy per neutron , @xmath19 @xmath20 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath1 are free parameters .",

    "when the eos of the neutron matter has been specified , the structure of an idealized spherically - symmetric neutron star model can be calculated by integrating the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations : @xmath33[\\epsilon+p / c^2]}{r[r-2gm(r)/c^2 ] } \\ , , \\label{eq : tov1}\\ ] ] @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the pressure and the energy density , @xmath37 is the neutron mass , @xmath38 is the gravitational mass enclosed within a radius @xmath2 , and @xmath39 is the gravitational constant .",
