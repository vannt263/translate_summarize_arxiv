    "over years coupled map lattice ( cml ) has become a very popular model to study a host of physical phenomena involving systems with spatial dimension  @xcite . in particular , cml exhibits a variety of spatio  temporal patterns and structures and has been extensively used , with varying degree of success , to model similar features in experimental systems such as rayleigh  bnard convection , taylor  couette flow , b  z reaction etc .",
    "one of the challenging problems is to understand the formation of structures , localized in both space and time , in turbulent fluid  @xcite .",
    "recently lot of attention has been devoted to the role of fluctuations in onset , selection and evolution of such patterns and structures  @xcite .",
    "an interesting and counterintuitive observation is that the presence of noise can help sustain structures which otherwise would have been absent in an evolving dynamical system .    in this paper",
    "we present the detailed account of a novel phenomenon that we have recently observed  @xcite in the dynamics of structures in a chaotically evolving cml , in one and two dimension , driven by identical noise .",
    "we call a _ structure _ as a group of neighboring sites whose variable  values follow certain prespecified spatial pattern . as the lattice evolves under the influence of noise , the number of these structures exhibits _ power  law decay _ with size of the structure for a given noise",
    " strength , with an exponent which is a function of noise  strength .",
    "it is observed that average size of these structures , plotted against noise  strength , shows a bell  shaped curve with a characteristic peak .",
    "similar features have been noted for the ` spatio  temporal structures ' also ( by this we mean the cluster of sites which remain in a structure as it evolves in time ) .",
    "average lifetime of these structures also exhibit a maximum within same range of noise values .",
    "the behaviors remain essentially the same in two dimensional cml as well .",
    "we call this new phenomenon _ stochastic coherence_.",
    "we first consider a one dimensional cml with the dynamics @xmath0 + \\eta_t\\ ; , \\label{sc1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , is value of the variable located at site @xmath3 at time @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the additive noise , @xmath6 is the ( nearest neighbor ) coupling strength , and @xmath7 is the size of the lattice .",
    "evolution on the lattice sites is governed by the nonlinear logistic function @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the nonlinearity parameter .",
    "both open  boundary conditions @xmath10 , and periodic  boundary conditions @xmath11 , have been used for our system . for noise",
    "@xmath5 we have chosen a uniformly distributed random number bounded between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we call @xmath14 the _ noise  strength _ parameter .",
    "we define a _ structure _ as a region of space such that the dynamical variables at sites within this region follow a prespecified spatial pattern  @xcite . for our purpose",
    "we choose a spatial pattern where the difference in the values of the variables of neighboring sites within the structure is less than a predefined small positive number say @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 we call @xmath15 the _ structure parameter_. we study the distributions of abundance and lifetimes of these coherent structures as the cml evolves chaotically .",
    "values of the system parameters @xmath9 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are so chosen that the dynamics of the system remains essentially chaotic .",
    "we have taken typical values @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "value of structure parameter @xmath15 is chosen as @xmath19 .",
    "coherent structures with length @xmath20 ( sites ) and lifetime @xmath21 ( timesteps ) are disregarded .",
    "@xmath14 is restricted to within @xmath22 $ ] . for the results presented here open ",
    "boundary conditions are used .",
    "80000 transient steps have been discarded and the data are integrated over 100000 iterates per initial condition and 4 different initial conditions .",
    "we have investigated the distribution of number @xmath23 of structures with their length @xmath24 , for different values of noise  strength parameter @xmath14 . in fig .  1 we show the plot ( on log  log scale ) of @xmath23 against @xmath24 , for five values of @xmath14 . the plot exhibits , over a wide range of scales , a characteristic _ power  law _ of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is power  law exponent .",
    "if one uses only a uniform  deviate random number as site ",
    "variable , probability that a site belongs to a structure of length @xmath24 is @xmath27 .",
    "so the number of such structures in a lattice of size @xmath7 will be @xmath28 which shows an exponential decay .",
    "thus correlations in the system are important to get a power law form .",
    "one can see from fig .  1 that the exponent @xmath26 of relation  ( [ sc3 ] ) depends on noise",
    " strength @xmath14 .",
    "2 shows the variation of @xmath26 with @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath26 is exhibiting a minimum for values of @xmath14 around @xmath29 . to get a clearer picture ,",
    "let us define average length @xmath30 of a structure as @xmath31 we have investigated how noise influences this quantity . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the variation of @xmath30 with @xmath14 for values of parameters as in fig .  1 .",
    "one sees a quite interesting _",
    "bell  shaped _",
    "dependence for @xmath14 around value @xmath29 .",
    "this behavior may remind one of the much studied stochastic resonance phenomenon  @xcite , a signature of which is the existence of a bell  shaped behavior of the temporal response of the system , when plotted against noise  strength .",
    "the similarity , however , is purely coincidental because there exists one important difference . in stochastic resonance noise transfers energy to the system at a given time scale , which usually is the characteristic scale of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "power law feature of fig .",
    "1 implies that our system does not have any preferred length scale ; noise _ induces coherence _ on all length scales .",
    "we call this novel phenomenon _ stochastic coherence_.      let us see , qualitatively , how noise modifies the stability matrix of the system , thereby influencing its stability properties .",
    "we consider stability matrix @xmath32 of a homogeneous state \\{@xmath33 @xmath34 } at time @xmath4 .",
    "this state may be imagined as a large structure with @xmath35 .",
    "one time step later the stability matrix is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the familiar tridiagonal matrix @xmath38 with @xmath39 as its diagonal elements and @xmath40 as offdiagonal elements on either sides , and @xmath41 after two more timesteps , the stability matrix takes the form @xmath42\\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now average this expression over the noise distribution .",
    "the noise has uniform distribution , with zero mean and delta  correlation . by averageing ,",
    "the terms containing cross terms in @xmath43 ( i.e. terms of the type @xmath44 ) and odd powers in @xmath43 vanish , leaving the following expression with only even powers in @xmath43 : @xmath45 , \\label{sc7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 denotes averaging over noise  distribution .",
    "one more averaging is needed , this time over the invariant distribution of the cml .",
    "4 shows the invariant density of a single site of cml , with @xmath47 and the other system parameters same as mentioned in the beginning of this section .",
    "the density is highly asymmetric , with larger weightage for @xmath48 .",
    "because of this asymmetry , averaging expression ( [ sc7 ] ) over the invariant density makes the term @xmath49 negative .",
    "this , added to the positive noise term @xmath50 , results in reduction of eigenvalue of the above matrix .",
    "this in turn implies a consequent reduction of the instability of the state ( or the structure ) .",
    "thus noise plays a crucial role in enhancing the abundance of the structures .",
    "let us now consider the evolutionary aspects of these coherent structurs .",
    "we have studied the distribution of the number @xmath51 of structures having lifetime @xmath52 . in order to obtain @xmath52 , each structure",
    "is tracked as the lattice evolves , till the structure degenerates completely . in fig .",
    "5 we show such an evolutionary diagram for a cml with a typical size @xmath53 , evolving chaotically for 200 timesteps .",
    "the shaded regions depict the evolution of coherent structures .",
    "6 shows the variation , on log  linear scale , of @xmath51 with @xmath52 , for different values of noise @xmath14 .",
    "number @xmath51 exhibits a decay with @xmath52 with a _ stretched exponential _",
    "form @xmath54 the exponent @xmath55 is seen to depend on @xmath14 .",
    "like in case of @xmath56 of expression ( [ sc3 ] ) , @xmath55 also exhibits a minimum near @xmath47 .",
    "we define average lifetime @xmath57 of a structure as @xmath58 and explore its dependence on noise strength @xmath14 .",
    "7 shows a plot of @xmath57 vs. @xmath14 .",
    "it again exhibits a maximum for @xmath14 around @xmath29 .",
    "there is another feature of the system which merits an elaborate study .",
    "this concerns the distribution of ` spatio  temporal structures ( sts ) ' .",
    "by such a structure we mean the group of sites that remain in a coherent structure as it evolves in time , till it completely degenerates .",
    "each shaded region of fig .",
    "5 constitutes one such sts . in fig .",
    "8 we plot the number @xmath59 of an sts vs. its ` size ' @xmath60 for different noise values @xmath14 .",
    "we again see an interesting power law dependence of the type ( [ sc3 ] ) for an appreciable range of sizes , but with different exponent .",
    "this exponent also depends on @xmath14 , with a minimum around @xmath61 .",
    "let us define average size @xmath62 of an sts in a similar fashion as @xmath63 we plot @xmath62 as function of @xmath14 in fig .",
    "this plot also exhibits a characteristic bell shape within a range around @xmath61 , quite similar to the plot in fig .  3 .",
    "we have studied the lyapunov exponent spectrum ( @xmath64 spectrum ) of the cml , and its dependence on noise @xmath14 as well as on the coupling parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we find that a number of lyapunov exponents is positive , thereby implying that the system is indeed evolving chaotically . in fig .",
    "10 we plot the variation of maximum exponent @xmath65 with noise strength @xmath14 , for coupling parameter @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath65 exhibits a clear minimum around @xmath61  @xcite , the same region where all the extrema reported above are located .",
    "this observation may create the impression that the reduction of lyapunov exponent alone is responsible for stochastic coherence .    to explore this possibility",
    ", we have studied the dependence of both @xmath65 and average length @xmath30 on coupling strength @xmath6 .",
    "11 plots the variation of @xmath65 with @xmath6 for different @xmath14 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath65 remains fairly constant for @xmath66 for all @xmath14 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath30 shows a monotonic increase with @xmath6 for all @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "12 we show one such plot of @xmath30 against @xmath6 , for @xmath47 .",
    "these two contrary features indicate that lyapunov exponent alone is not good enough to characterize the full range of spatio  temporal features of the system .",
    "it is worth pointing out that stochastic coherence is quite distinctive phenomenon as compared to spatio ",
    "temporal intermittency  @xcite . in intermittency",
    "the system exhibits alternately regular and chaotic bursts in time .",
    "our system does not show any such behavior .",
    "this fact is further corroborated by the fact that the power spectrum of time  series does not have any peak for entire range of noise  strength .",
    "thus our system is undergoing essentially a _ spatially intermittent and temporally chaotic _ evolution .",
    "one quite interesting phenomenon that we have observed is that for @xmath67 often the entire lattice itself evolves as a single coherent structure .",
    "this state should be distinguished from the synchronized state where at any given instant @xmath4 , @xmath68 for @xmath2 ( that is , @xmath35 ) .",
    "on occasions this _ full lattice coherence _ ( flc ) survives for quite long durations ( as long as 200 timesteps or more ) , but eventually degenerates completely .",
    "this implies that synchronized state is not a stable attractor for our system .",
    "we have confirmed this by calculating the largest lyapunov exponent for the synchronized state which turns out to be positive .",
    "however , occasionally our system did fall into an apparently synchronized state after a very large time ( larger than @xmath69 steps ) .",
    "this happens because of finite accuracy of computation which can not differentiate between unstable and stable synchronized states  @xcite .",
    "let us investigate this point further .",
    "we define a quantity @xmath70 as the average time required for first occurrence of flc , the averaging taken over different initial conditions . in fig .",
    "13 we plot , on log  log scale , @xmath70 against the structure parameter @xmath15 , for a fixed lattice size @xmath71 .",
    "the plot exhibits a power law of the form @xmath72 this relation implies that the synchronized state ( @xmath35 ) will not occur in a finite lattice .",
    "we now show , in fig .",
    "14 , the plot of @xmath70 against lattice size @xmath7 , for a fixed @xmath15 .",
    "this is again a power law of the type @xmath73 we thus see that as @xmath74 , even flc with a nonzero @xmath15 will not be attained . therefore , relations ( [ sc11 ] ) and ( [ sc12 ] ) tell us that synchronized state for our system is an artifact , resuting due to the combined effect of finite lattice size and finite computational accuracy .    existence of flc in a finite lattice can be seen to be a consequence of the power ",
    "law ( [ sc3 ] ) .",
    "probability of a site to belong to a structure of length @xmath24 , following ( [ sc3 ] ) , is @xmath75 .",
    "the probability of a site to belong to a structure of length @xmath76 is then @xmath77 ( this holds for @xmath78 , which is true for our system as can be seen from fig .  2 ) .",
    "thus , the probability that for the first time a site belongs to a structure of length @xmath76 at timestep @xmath79 is @xmath80 .",
    "average of @xmath79 is @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 this shows that flc ( with nonzero @xmath15 ) will occur in a finite lattice . from fig .",
    "2 we get @xmath83 for @xmath47 . on the other hand ,",
    "we estimate ( from fig .",
    "14 ) @xmath84 of relation ( [ sc12 ] ) to be approximately 0.3 .",
    "the discrepancy may occur due to the fact that relation ( [ sc13 ] ) holds for an infinite lattice , whereas relation ( [ sc12 ] ) is numerically obtained for finite lattices .",
    "let us now consider a two dimensional cml .",
    "the dynamics of this system takes the form @xmath85 + \\eta_t\\ ; , \\label{sc14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , is the value of the variable at site ( @xmath88 ) in the lattice having size @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . for structures in this lattice",
    "we look for those sites ( @xmath88 ) with @xmath91 and , @xmath92 as the cml evolves , we study the distributions of abundance and lifetimes of these two dimensional structures , as we have done for one dimensional system .",
    "we present some of the observations in the following .",
    "again we have chosen the system parameters so that the cml evolves chaotically .",
    "typical values taken are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "we have chosen structure parameter @xmath19 .",
    "3000 transient steps have been discarded , and data are obtained over 20000 iterates per initial condition and 4 initial conditions .",
    "we have used open boundary conditions for the results presented here .",
    "15 exhibits the plot ( on log  log scale ) of distribution of the number @xmath96 of coherent structures against their size @xmath97 for different @xmath14 ( we use the notation @xmath97 to denote size of the structures in two dimensional cml , unlike @xmath24 which has been used for one dimensional case .",
    "this is also to be distinguished from @xmath60 , the notation used for sizes of sts ) .",
    "one can see a power law of the form @xmath98 similar to the relation  ( [ sc3 ] ) , for a wide range of values of @xmath97 ( for @xmath99 ; there is a slight bend in the graphs for @xmath100 ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath101 for the power law is slightly less in value than its one dimensional counterpart @xmath26 , for all @xmath14 , indicating a less steeper decay .",
    "these exponents again show a dip around @xmath47 .",
    "we define the average size @xmath102 of the structures as @xmath103 @xmath102 exhibits a corresponding peak around @xmath47 .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the bell  shaped curve of fig .",
    "16 , which is the plot of @xmath102 against @xmath14 .",
    "this plot is quite alike the one of fig .",
    "3 .    in fig .",
    "17 we plot , on log  linear scale , distribution of number @xmath51 of structures against their lifetime @xmath52 .",
    "the plot shows a stretched exponential type behavior of the form ( [ sc8 ] ) , similar to fig .",
    "18 shows the variation of average lifetime @xmath57 , as defined in ( [ sc9 ] ) , with noise strength @xmath14 .",
    "we see a peak near @xmath47 , quite similar to the plot of fig .",
    "distribution of number @xmath104 of sts is plotted , on log  log scale , against size @xmath105 in fig .",
    "we see a very similar power law decay as in fig .  8 for one dimensional cml . as in previous instances , we define average size @xmath106 of sts as @xmath107 fig .",
    "20 shows the variation of @xmath106 with noise strength @xmath14 .",
    "the plot shows a bell  shaped peak around @xmath47 , similar to the plot of fig .",
    "all the other features that are observed in one dimensional system are also seen in two dimensional cml .",
    "for instance , we have seen full lattice coherence for @xmath108 , which persist for considerable duration before eventually breaking up .",
    "we have repeated all the above observations , for both one and two dimensional systems , for several other values of the coupling parameter @xmath6 ranging from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , as well as for nonlinearity parameter @xmath9 between @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we find that all the features remain essentially the same , indicating the robustness of the phenomenon .",
    "we have also observed similar results using periodic ",
    "boundary conditions for the lattice .",
    "we have investigated in details a new phenomenon associated with structures in a chaotically evolving cml , in both one and two dimensions , driven by identical noise .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ stochastic coherence_. we have seen a marked rise in abundance of coherent structures of all scales due to noise",
    ". stability matrix of these structures shows that noise can reduce their instability , thereby enhancing abundance .. distribution of the structures exhibits a power  law decay with size of the structure , with an exponent having a minimum at some intermediate noise  strength .",
    "average size of these structures shows a bell  shaped maximum at the same value of noise  strength .",
    "this feature is similar to that of the stochastic resonance phenomenon .",
    "however , our system does not have any intrinsic length  scale , whereas stochastic resonance is associated with a given time ",
    "we have also observed similar maxima for the average lifetime of these structures as well as for the average size of ` spatio  temporal structures ' , at the value of noise close to the earlier extrema .",
    "our phenomena may have their importance in understanding the interesting role that noise plays in formation and evolution of structures in spatially extended systems .",
