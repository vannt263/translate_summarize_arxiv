    "lyman - alpha emitters ( lae ) are galaxies selected through strong emission and are among the most studied galaxy populations at high redshift .",
    "the use of narrow band filters over a wide area on the sky has proven to be a very effective method to find galaxies up to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the possibility of finding laes from @xmath17 to @xmath16 shows that this type of galaxies can be used to understand galaxy evolution over cosmic time .",
    "it has been observed that the lae fraction in uv selected galaxies increases with redshift up to @xmath18 @xcite , which is expected due to the decreasing dust content at higher redshifts . beyond @xmath18",
    "it is expected that the lae fraction decreases as the amount of neutral hydrogen ( ) increases , due to the incomplete reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the comparatively low success rate of detection of emission at @xmath19 .",

    "tracers at optical / uv wavelengths , the only line that has been observed at @xmath24 in galaxies is ly - alpha .",
    "the emission of ly - alpha is complicated by its high optical depth in the emission region and its escape through resonant scattering , by dust absorption , and by the contribution from outflows .",
    "therefore direct constrains on the gas properties from the ly - alpha line strength and shape are difficult to derive .",
    "this motivates the exploration of alternative means to study the highest redshift galaxies .",
    "promising candidates include far - infrared fine structure emission lines , e.g. , ( @xmath25p@xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath25p@xmath28 ) at @xmath29 @xmath15 m , which is not affected by the increasingly neutral igm at @xmath30 and can account for up to @xmath31 of the total infrared luminosity in some galaxies , especially in those with low luminosity and metallicity @xcite .",

    "the different conditions in which the emission is produced , and the direct or indirect relation of these conditions with the star formation process , suggest that emission should be a good tracer of the global galactic star formation activity @xcite , at least for galaxies with low @xmath33 or low @xmath34 @xcite .",

    "this nebula can be explained , at least in a qualitative way , as a superwind caused by the supernovae explosion of ob stars in the late phase of the evolution of a starburst .    in conclusion , this lae is not intrinsically different from the general population of lae .",

    "the emission produced in the cnm follows the gravitational potential of the clumps , resulting in narrow emission lines associated with each clumps .",

    "the upper limits for the lensed lae at @xmath155 hcm 6a and himiko suggest that laes at @xmath156 could fall below the relation found at low redshift .",

    "the high magnification of allows us to explore an uv - sfr one order of magnitude lower than the ones of the laes , showing the advantage of observing lensed galaxies to cover the intrinsically faint population at high redshift .      using the same procedure presented in @xcite for the emission of himiko",

    "here we assumed a continuum star formation rate of 20 @xmath158 , for the older stellar populations there is a higher amount of heating photons coming from the uv part of the spectrum .",
    "this is a result of using a continuum star formation mode , for a given sfr , older populations have more time generating young uv emitting stars .",
    "these extra heating photons avoid the cooling of the gas , which decrease the amount of gas in the cold neutral medium , where most of the emission is produced .      for a gaussian emission line , with a fwhm of 50 observed at a channel resolution of 200 kms@xmath42 , emission lines will be significantly diluted . in the best case scenario of the line falling completely in one channel , we will recover 38% of the peak flux density of the line .",

    "we summarize our results and conclusions as follows :    1 .",
    "we have not detected emission line any of our targets .",
    "given the recent observational results and simulations of the emission in high redshift lae , we adopt a line width of 50 for the emission .",

    "we find @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 as upper limits for iok-1 , 1 and respectively , these values account for the effect of the cmb on the observations . for macs0647-jd ,",
    "the upper limit in the fir luminosity is @xmath14 , after correcting for the cmb and the lensing magnification .",
    "we present the results of simulations supporting the brightest component of the line having a width of the order of @xmath191 . here",
    "we want to emphasize the necessity of resolving such emission lines in future alma observations , to not loose signal - to - noise ratio , by selecting a channel resolution that is too low .",
    "the effect of the cmb must to be taken into account in attempts to detect the fir continuum in galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the heating of cold dust by cmb photons can shift the peak of the fir continuum to values up to a @xmath192 microns for galaxies with temperature of @xmath193 k and redshift of @xmath39 .",

    "simulations are already showing us that the task of detecting in high redshift galaxies is going to be difficult even with alma , as confirmed by the recent sensitive non - detection of himiko by @xcite . accordingly to our iok-1 simulations , a key parameter for the emission in laes is the metallicity , as we discussed in sect .",

    "estimating the metallicity of laes at high redshift is not an easy task , however , @xcite found that for the sample of laes discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) grism in the redshift range of @xmath195 , there is an anti - correlation of the equivalent width of the h@xmath45 emission line with metallicity .",
    "higher ew(h@xmath45 ) sources all have lower metallicities , bluer colors , smaller sizes , and less extinction .",
    "@xcite also found a broad general trend that for higher ew(h@xmath45 ) , the ew(@xmath196 ) is also higher . if we assume that these relations are valid for the laes at high redshift , and that the goal is to observe the lae with the highest metallicity possible , it may be best to target the brightest lae in the uv but with the lowest equivalent width .",
