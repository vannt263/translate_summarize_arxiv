    "photon assisted tunneling ( pat ) across quantum dots ( qd ) @xcite is observed in microwave fields when the fermi level electrons pass across the higher - energy confined levels upon absorption of the energy from the radiation field .",

    "<S> we consider the photon - assisted tunneling ( pat ) and the landau - zener - stueckelberg ( lzs ) interference for double quantum dots induced electrostatically along a semiconducting carbon nanotube . an atomistic tight - binding approach and the time - dependent configuration interaction method </S>",
    "<S> are employed for description of the systems of a few confined electrons and holes . </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the patterns of the lzs interference recently observed for the quantum double dots describing transport across hole - localized states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we indicate that for charge configurations for which the ground - state is pauli blocked pat can be used for resolution of the transitions that involve spin - flip or intervalley transitions without the spin - valley conserving background signal . </S>"
