    "this novel type of bifurcation leads to a new type of heterogeneous oscillatory state , in which different units oscillate at similar frequencies but random phases .",
    "we investigated the dynamics of a network of @xmath0 randomly connected rate units @xcite given by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the activity of unit @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the transfer function , and @xmath5 represents a delay in the interaction between the units .",

    "the structure of the oscillatory activity can be understood from the linear analysis close to the instability . in the limit when a single",

    "this oscillatory state is governed by a novel type of bifurcation , in which a continuum of eigenvalues crosses the instability line at a non - zero frequency . in this state",
    ", individual units oscillate with random phases , so that the summed population activity remains constant in time .    from this perspective , the heterogeneous oscillatory state bears some similarity with the splay - state , an asynchronous regime in networks of interacting oscillators @xcite .",
    "one important difference is that in the classical splay state the individual units oscillate even in absence of coupling .",
    "in contrast , in the network considered here , the individual units are not intrinsic oscillators . in absence of coupling ,",
    "their activity is constant in time , and the oscillations appear only when the coupling increases beyond a critical value .",
    "note also that while both the splay state and the heterogeneous oscillatory state are  asynchronous \" in the sense that the macroscopic activity displays no oscillations , they are distinct from other types of asynchronous states @xcite in which the individual units do not oscillate .",
    "the instability described here is also related to the oscillatory turing instability described in the context of random ecological networks @xcite . that bifurcation is also generated by a continuous part of the eigenspectrum of the stability matrix , and leads to heterogeneous oscillations in which different nodes in the network oscillate out of phase .",
    "the underlying mechanism is however different as in ref .",

    ".    following previous works , we considered here a simplified network with a gaussian connectivity matrix , and a transfer function symmetric around zero",
    ". such a model does not implement basic biophysical constraints such as segregation between excitatory and inhibitory neurons , or the requirement that neural activity is positive .",
    "the influence of such constraints on the zero - frequency instability to rate chaos have been investigated recently in a series of works @xcite .",
    "these studies focused on the asymmetric case . determining how the heterogeneous oscillatory state described here occurs in more realistic networks will require combining excitation - inhibition segregation with symmetry ( or asymmetry ) in the connections .",
