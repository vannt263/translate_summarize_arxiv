    "frustration and dimensionality are two crucial parameters underlying the physics of magnetic systems . in insulators , these parameters rarely correlate with the apparent features of the atomic arrangement , because superexchange couplings are highly sensitive to details of the electronic structure and to positions of non - magnetic atoms linking the magnetic sites . while computational techniques based on electronic structure calculations developed into a powerful tool for elucidating spin lattices of complex materials , simple phenomenological criteria are equally important for the preliminary assessment of the experimental data and the compound under consideration .",
    "the best - known phenomenological criterion of the magnetic frustration is the @xmath7 ratio .",
    "it compares the curie - weiss temperature @xmath8 , which is often considered as an effective energy scale of the magnetic couplings , to the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath9.@xcite high @xmath7 ratios are believed to indicate strong frustration , although this rule will only hold for simple systems with few exchange couplings and well - established dimensionality .",
    "thus , the @xmath10 ratio is easily obtained even in non - frustrated quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , where strong quantum fluctuations due to the weak interchain couplings effectively prevent the system from long - range ordering down to low temperatures.@xcite another possible scenario is that of magnets with strong dimer correlations , where the long - range - ordered state competes with the disordered singlet ground state , and the ordering temperature @xmath9 may be strongly reduced without any frustration involved.@xcite the low @xmath7 ratio can be equally deceptive , because @xmath8 is in fact a linear combination of different exchange couplings that can be much smaller than the effective energy scale of the system .",
    "for example , the coexistence of ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) couplings renders @xmath8 and @xmath7 low even in strongly frustrated magnets.@xcite    the phenomenological assessment of the frustration in a magnetic system has to be backed by additional criteria .",
    "magnetic specific heat is an especially appealing quantity , because it is expressed in absolute units and does not require an ambiguous reference to the effective energy scale of the system .",
    "further , the magnetic specific heat distinguishes between the effects of dimensionality and frustration , with the latter leading to a much stronger reduction in the maximum of the magnetic specific heat ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "for example , the spin-@xmath2 square lattice ( two - dimensional , non - frustrated ) reveals the maximum of @xmath12 , the spin-@xmath2 uniform chain ( one - dimensional , non - frustrated ) shows a lower maximum of @xmath13 , but the specific heat maximum for the spin-@xmath2 triangular lattice ( two - dimensional , frustrated ) is even lower , @xmath14.@xcite the reduced magnetic specific heat is a seemingly unambiguous measure of the frustration .",
    "it can be equally used to identify strongly frustrated spin systems@xcite or to refute premature conclusions on the strong frustration.@xcite however , this phenomenological criterion is not universal , as we demonstrate below .",

    "this lattice topology should induce magnetic frustration , as further corroborated by the magnetic specific heat that reaches the maximum value of @xmath14 and strongly resembles theoretical predictions for the spin-@xmath2 triangular lattice.@xcite    in the following , we will show that the reduced @xmath11 has a different origin , and arises from a peculiar superposition of fm and afm spin chains .",

    "<S> based on density functional theory band structure calculations , quantum monte - carlo simulations , and high - field magnetization measurements , we address the microscopic magnetic model of baag@xmath0cu[vo@xmath1_2 $ ] that was recently proposed as a spin-@xmath2 anisotropic triangular lattice system . we show that the actual physics of this compound is determined by a peculiar superposition of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic uniform spin chains with nearest - neighbor exchange couplings of @xmath3  k and @xmath4  k , respectively . the two chains featuring different types of the magnetic exchange perfectly mimic the specific heat of a triangular spin lattice , while leaving a clear imprint on the magnetization curve that is incompatible with the triangular - lattice model . </S>",
    "<S> both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin chains run along the crystallographic @xmath5 direction , and slightly differ in the mutual arrangement of the magnetic cuo@xmath6 plaquettes and non - magnetic vo@xmath6 tetrahedra </S>",
    "<S> . these subtle structural details are , therefore , crucial for the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic nature of the exchange couplings , and put forward the importance of comprehensive microscopic modeling for a proper understanding of quantum spin systems in transition - metal compounds . </S>"
