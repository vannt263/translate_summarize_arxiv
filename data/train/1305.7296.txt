    "scale - free networks are loosely defined to be networks where the number of connections per node has a power - law distribution  @xcite .",
    "such a definition is problematic because firstly the specification is vague , and secondly determining whether a histogram has a power - law distribution is notoriously difficult  @xcite .",
    "algorithms such as _ preferential attachment _ generate putative scale - free networks , but it is not clear that the networks are representative of typical scale - free networks  @xcite . nor is it clear whether duplication models  @xcite that model biological processes of network growth generate scale - free networks  @xcite , or suffer similar difficulties .",
    "nonetheless , preferential attachment has become the _ de facto _ standard , and often treated as synonymous with scale - free .",
    "_ scale - free _ clearly refers to a statistical property of networks .",
    "imagine a process that generates random graphs with specified properties , like being scale - free with power - law  @xmath0 .",
    "some characteristics of graphs can be prescribed precisely , like the number of nodes , or the minimum vertex degree .",
    "other characteristics , like being scale - free with power - law  @xmath0 , are truly statistical .",
    "these characteristics are specified probabilistically , such as by the probability of a number of nodes having certain degrees . for statistical properties like  @xmath0 ,",
    "it is not clear cut whether a graph has a specified  @xmath0  unless one artificially adopts a particular way to measure  @xmath0 . for statistical properties",
    "every graph should be assigned a probability of being generated by the process that generates random graphs with the specified property .",
    "many graphs will have zero or negligibly small probability , but other graphs have a high probability , perhaps even for different but close values of  @xmath0 .",
    "this letter describes tools and procedures to explore random graphs with precisely defined properties . as an example we consider scale - free graphs with explicitly prescribed size  @xmath1 , power - law  @xmath2 , and other characteristics , like minimum vertex degree  @xmath3 . with our tools",
    "we reveal previously unrecognised richness of scale - free graphs ; figure  [ fig : boing ] illustrates two examples that are unlike anything generated by preferential attachment .",
    "we discover that structural properties of scale - free graphs with @xmath4 fall into four categories according to three critical power - law values @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , and an existence lower bound @xmath2 .",
    "we also show the critical effect minimum vertex degree  @xmath3 has on the properties of scale - free graphs , and argue that some properties previously claimed to be due to scale - free characteristics are more likely due to effects of the minimum vertex degree  @xmath3 .",

    "our aim is to define processes to generate random graphs with specified properties ; in particular graphs of a fixed size and prescribed distributions of vertex degrees .    let @xmath10 be the set of connected graphs with @xmath1 nodes and at most one edge between any pair of nodes . since @xmath10 is a finite set , then a process that randomly generates graphs with fixed characteristics is equivalent to assigning a probability mass  @xmath11 to each graph @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath12 let @xmath13 be the number of nodes of degree  @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 is the histogram of the degrees of the nodes of @xmath16 .",

    ", if a characteristic depends only on  @xmath18 , then any graph @xmath19 will serve as a representative of this characteristic .",
    "hence , write the probability mass @xmath20 , and stipulate that @xmath21 is the same for all graphs in  @xmath22 .",
    "then , graphs within  @xmath22 are _ equally likely _ , and are treated as equal representatives of the properties of  @xmath22 .",

    "is a normalisation that depends implicitly on other factors , like the sizes of the sets @xmath22 , which are extremely difficult to compute . )",
    "imagine then a process that _ randomly selects _ graphs from @xmath10 such that there is a probability @xmath23 of a node having degree  @xmath14 for each @xmath24 . for graphs generated this way",
    "@xmath25 has a _ multinomial _ distribution , @xmath26 the methodology that follows can be applied to arbitrary degree distributions , and used to explore any statistical property that is determined by a degree distribution alone .",
    "a natural choice for the scale - free property is the zeta - distribution , where @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath2 and @xmath29 .",
    "the constant @xmath0 defines the _ power - law_. ( note : eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta ] ) implies @xmath4 . )",
    "the question now is how to randomly generate scale - free graphs as we define .",
    "a monte - carlo markov - chain ( mcmc ) approach can be used  @xcite .",
    "starting with an arbitrary initial graph @xmath12 one systematically proposes random _ simple _ modifications of the graph  @xmath16 to produce a different graph @xmath30 .",

    "an mcmc approach accepts @xmath32 as a replacement for  @xmath16 if @xmath33 and if @xmath34 , then @xmath32 is accepted with probability  @xmath35 .",
    "asymptotically , random graphs with the specified degree distribution  ( [ eq : prn ] ) are obtained .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the most basic modifications are adding and deleting a single edge .",
    "for example , if @xmath32 is obtained from @xmath16 by adding an edge between a node of degree  @xmath14 and another node of degree  @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , then @xmath13 and @xmath38 decrease by one , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 increase by one . using ( [ eq : q ] ) it can be easily derived that adding an edge @xmath41 , or deleting an edge @xmath42 , between node of degree  @xmath14 and another node of degree  @xmath36 , results in @xmath43      \\frac{n_k}{p_k } \\frac{p_{l+s}}{(n_{l+s}+1 ) } , & { } _ \\text{$k+s = l$,}\\\\[5pt ]      \\frac{n_l}{p_l } \\frac{p_{k+s}}{(n_{k+s}+1 ) } , & { } _ \\text{$k = l+s$,}\\\\[5pt ]      \\frac{n_k(n_k-1)}{p_k^2}\\frac{p_{k+s}^2}{(n_{k+s}+2)(n_{k+s}+1 ) } , & { } _ \\text{$k = l$ , $ n_k\\geq2$. }    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] for scale - free graphs substitute ( [ eq : zeta ] ) into ( [ eq : qaddsub ] ) , and note that the zeta functions cancel out entirely .",
    "adding and deleting edges is transitive in  @xmath10 , but another useful modification that accelerates convergence is to disconnect one or more edges from a node , and reconnect these edges to other nodes . consider the simplest case where a _",
    "node has degree  @xmath14 , that @xmath44 edges are disconnected and these are all reconnected to a _",
    "node of degree  @xmath36 ; we will call such modifications _",
    "gifting_. the degrees of the giver and receiver nodes decrease and increase respectively by  @xmath45 ; it follows that since necessarily @xmath46 , then @xmath47       \\frac{n_k(n_k-1)\\ { } p_{k - m}\\ { } p_{k+m}}{p_k^2\\ { } ( n_{k - m}+1)(n_{k+m}+1 ) } , &        { { } _ \\text{$k = l$ , $ n_k\\geq2$,}}\\\\[4pt ]      1 , & { } _ \\text{$k = l+m$,}\\\\      \\frac{n_k}{p_k}\\frac{n_l}{p_l}\\frac{p_{k - m}^2}{(n_{k - m}+1)(n_{k - m}+2 ) } , &       { { } _ \\text{$k - m = l+m$. } }    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] substitution of ( [ eq : zeta ] ) gives @xmath35 for scale - free graphs .",
    "care is required making any modification to a graph because it can result in graphs that are not in  @xmath10 .",
    "given the assumed properties of @xmath10 an edge can only be added if the nodes are not already connected , and deletion of an existing edge is only allowed if the resulting graph is connected .",
    "gifting can also result in disconnected graphs .",
    "ensuring the graph is connected is a somewhat involved process , and somewhat tangential to our interests , so to avoid disrupting our narrative we will deal with this detail later when describing the algorithm used in our calculations .",
    "we have introduced some basic methods of modifying graphs in @xmath10 to obtain different graphs in  @xmath10 .",
    "these can be used in an mcmc approach , but an mcmc approach can be slow to converge , especially if the arbitrary initial graph is far from being scale - free . an alternative approach is to seek _ highly likely _",
    "graphs by maximising @xmath11 . this can be achieved by considering various modifications of  @xmath16 and selecting the modification that has the largest  @xmath35 . our algorithm to implement gradient ascent of  @xmath35 , which is used in our calculations , is described and discussed later .",
    "so then , we come to answer the question in the title .",
    "figure  [ fig : g ] shows highly likely scale - free graphs obtained using the gradient ascent algorithm stated later ; these graphs are typical representatives .",
    "we find there is a significant subset of scale - free graphs that are trees , especially for larger @xmath0 values .",
    "for intermediate  @xmath0 scale - free graphs are similar to scale - free trees with some extra edges linking nodes , which break the tree structure by creating loops . for smaller @xmath0 values",
    "the proportion of edges creating loops increases .",
    "this tree - like nature deserves closer attention , because it has been noted elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath12 , then a spanning tree @xmath48 of  @xmath16 has exactly @xmath49 edges , so the number of edges @xmath50 of  @xmath16 in excess of @xmath51 is an indication of the amount of cross - linking .",
    "excesses are stated for the graphs in figure  [ fig : g ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the expected excess @xmath52 for scale - free graphs in  @xmath10 with @xmath53 , @xmath4 , is @xmath54 =     n\\times\\left(\\frac12\\frac{\\zeta(\\gamma-1)}{\\zeta(\\gamma)}-1\\right)+1.\\ ] ] the quantity in brackets is decreasing , diverging to positive infinity as @xmath0 approaches 2 from above , negative for @xmath55 , and equal to one at @xmath56 .",
    "the expected excess  ( [ eq : excess ] ) implies that for @xmath57 scale - free graphs are always expected to be trees .",
    "in fact , there should be a deficit of edges , which forces scale - free graphs toward the extreme of one node of very large degree and many nodes of degree one , like figure  [ fig : g](d ) . for @xmath58 scale - free graphs",
    "are expected to have less cross - links than links in a spanning tree , and so are tree - like . for @xmath59",
    "there are expected to be more cross links than spanning tree links , so the graphs are not expected to be tree - like , and are frequently observed in real world networks  @xcite . for @xmath53 the excess",
    "is expected to be a bounded multiple of the number of nodes  @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath60 the expected number of links grows without bound as @xmath1 increases until nearly fully connected graphs are produced .",
    "these far from tree - like graphs have been termed _ dense _",
    "@xcite , but , contrary to the claim of the cited work , there are many such dense graphs for any  @xmath1 and @xmath61 ; our supplied algorithm finds them easily , because it searches within the set of graphs  @xmath10 , rather than by histogram .",
    "we conclude that random scale - free graphs with @xmath4 and @xmath58 are best characterized as having an under - lying , more - or - less scale - free , tree , and are expected to be scale - free trees for @xmath57 , and nodes with very large degree for larger  @xmath0 .",
    "these characteristic structures are well illustrated in figure  [ fig : g ] .",
    "furthermore , the characteristics are confirmed by observing the relative frequency of the different modifications during the likelihood ascent .",
    "table  [ tab : q ] compiles a summary of the typical behaviour of likelihood ascent . for @xmath62 , the non - tree like case with many cross - links , the likelihood ascent is mainly adding and gifting edges . for @xmath63 , the tree - like case with few cross - links",
    ", the likelihood ascent is mainly deleting and gifting edges .",
    "we have introduced means to obtain scale - free graphs by modification of an initial graph . given our conclusion that scale - free graphs for @xmath64 are essentially tree - like",
    ", this suggests an alternative constructive approach for building random scale - free graphs by adding individual nodes with one link .",
    "if a graph  @xmath12 is modified by adding a node with one link to an existing node of degree  @xmath14 , then a new graph @xmath65 is created with @xmath66      { \\scriptstyle(n+1)}\\frac{p_2}{n_2 + 1 } , & k=1 ,    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] which follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : prn ] ) similar to  ( [ eq : q ] ) . hence , eq .  ( [ eq : qaddnode ] ) provides an optimal preferential attachment rule , however , attachment rules alone need not result in highly likely graphs  @xcite .",
    "locally optimum graphs can be obtained if after one or more attachments the link modifications previously described are used .",
    "figure  [ fig : xs ] shows the growth of excess links @xmath67 , for @xmath12 constructed in this way with eq .",
    "( [ eq : qaddnode ] ) used as the attachment rule .",
    "the staircase shape results from occasional avalanches of link modifications after a period of mainly node - link additions with few modifications .",
    "there appears to be a self - organised criticality .",
    "for @xmath61 the excess should grow without bound until the graph is almost fully connected , but figure  [ fig : xs ] clearly shows the number of nodes needs to be many orders of magnitude before this effect is apparent ; only @xmath62 has more cross - links than spanning - tree links for @xmath68 nodes .",
    "for @xmath69 the growth of  @xmath67 should become asymptotically linear in  @xmath1 , that is , a constant proportion of cross - links .",
    "once again , graphs many orders of magnitude larger are required before this effect is apparent .     of random scale - free graphs with @xmath1 nodes , computed by optimal additions and local likelihood ascent for various @xmath0 .",
    "we now state and discuss the algorithm used in the computations . this algorithm",
    "sequentially modifies the links of a given graph to obtain another graph with the same number of nodes but higher likelihood of being scale - free .",
    "links are modified by the three operations of adding , deleting , and gifting .",

    "this brings into question some qualities , like robustness and clustering , that have been claimed to be due to the scale - free property of graphs .",
