    "the masses of galaxies are traditionally estimated by dynamical methods from the kinematics of their stars and gas . ever since extended hi rotation curves",
    "were first measured for spirals , it has been clear that the implied masses include not only the observed material , but also substantial amounts of dark matter .",
    "indeed , it is now believed that most galaxies are surrounded by dark halos which extend to many times their optical radii and contain an order of magnitude more mass than the visible components .",
    "the properties of these halos can be inferred directly from tracers at large radii such as x - ray emitting atmospheres , systems of satellite galaxies , or weak gravitational distortion of background galaxy images . in practice , gaseous atmospheres are visible only around some bright elliptical galaxies ,",
    "while the other two techniques are too noisy to apply to individual galaxies ; they are used to obtain average halo properties for stacked samples of similar galaxies ( zaritsky et al 1993 ; mckay et al 2002 ) .    in order to understand how galaxies formed",
    ", we would like to map the relationship between the properties of the observed baryonic components of galaxies and those of their dark halos .",
    "this mapping should yield information about how the baryons cooled , condensed and turned into stars as the halo - galaxy systems were assembled , and should clarify the complex physical processes that regulated the efficiency and timing of galaxy formation .",
    "most studies of the halo - galaxy relation have used luminosity as a surrogate for total baryon content , and a kinematic measure  peak rotation velocity , stellar velocity dispersion , x - ray atmosphere temperature  as a surrogate for halo mass .",
    "both surrogates are far from ideal .",
    "kinematic measures are strongly affected by the visible components of the galaxy and so have an uncertain relation to halo mass ; only satellite and weak lensing studies can reliably estimate total halo masses , albeit as an average over all galaxies in a chosen class .",
    "galaxy luminosity may not correlate well with stellar mass ( the dominant baryonic component in all but a subset of the smallest systems ) .",
    "there are strong dependences on the fraction of young stars in the galaxy and on its dust content .",
    "thus a technique to correct for attenuation by dust and to estimate the mass - to - light ratio of the underlying stellar population is needed to estimate the stellar mass of a galaxy .",
    "it is well - known that luminosities are less affected by stellar population variations in the near - infrared than in the optical , and that extinction corrections are also smaller at longer wavelengths .",
    "recently verheijen ( 2001 ) studied the b , r , i and k-band tully - fisher relations of a volume - limited sample of 49 spiral galaxies in the ursa major cluster .",
    "he showed that the k-band relation exhibited the tightest correlation with rotation velocity , suggesting that the stellar masses of galaxies are linked closely with the masses of the dark matter halos in which they formed .",
    "the larger scatter in the shorter wavelength passbands was attributed to variations in star formation history and dust extinction between different galaxies in the sample .",
    "although near - infrared luminosities are less dependent on star formation history than optical luminosities , they nevertheless exhibit some sensitivity to stellar age .",
    "bell & de jong ( 2001 ) estimate that the near - infrared mass - to - light ratios of local spirals can vary by as much as a factor of two and propose a correction based on the optical colours of the galaxies .",
    "brinchmann & ellis ( 2000 ) also used colour - based methods to transform the near - infrared magnitudes of a sample of intermediate redshift galaxies into stellar masses . in both analyses",
    ", it was assumed that the star formation histories of galaxies could be described by simple exponential laws .",
    "if galaxies formed a major ( @xmath26% ) fraction of their stars in recent bursts , it was shown that this would introduce substantial errors into the estimated mass - to - light ratios .    in this paper",
    ", we make use of spectral indicators as diagnostics of the past star formation histories of galaxies . in particular , two spectral features , the 4000  break and the h@xmath27 absorption line ,",
    "provide important information about the ages of the stellar populations in galaxies and are able to distinguish recent star formation histories dominated by bursts from those that are more continuous .",
    "we develop a method based on these two indicators and on broad - band photometry that allows us to derive maximum likelihood estimates of the stellar mass of a galaxy , the attenuation of its starlight by dust , and the fraction of its stars formed in recent bursts .",
    "we apply our method to a sample of @xmath28 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey and show how the derived stellar mass - to - light ratios of galaxies in four sloan bandpasses ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; fukugita et al 1996 ) depend both on galaxy luminosity and on structural parameters such as concentration index .",
    "we also compute the fraction of the total stellar mass in the universe in galaxies of different masses , sizes , colours and concentrations .",
    "the dependence of galaxy properties on stellar mass is addressed in a separate paper ( kauffmann et al 2002 ; paper ii )",
    "the sample of galaxies analyzed in this paper is drawn from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "this survey will obtain @xmath33 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 photometry of almost a quarter of the sky and spectra of at least 700,000 objects .",
    "the survey goals and procedures are outlined in york et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and a description of the data products and pipelines is given in stoughton et al.(2002 ) .",
    "our sample of galaxies is drawn from all available spectroscopic observations in the sdss data release one ( dr1 ) .",
    "we have included all objects spectroscopically classified as galaxies with petrosian @xmath30 band magnitudes in the range @xmath34 after correction for foreground galactic extinction using the reddening maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the ` main ' galaxy sample designed for large - scale structure studies .",
    "our sample contains a total of 122,808 galaxies .",
    "more details about the sdss photometric system may be found in fukugita et al ( 1996 ) and smith et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "information relating to the sdss camera and photometric monitoring system can be found in gunn et al ( 1998 ) and hogg et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "details of the spectroscopic target selection of galaxies are given in strauss et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "the spectra were reduced using version v4.9.5 of the spectro2d pipeline .",
    "the processed spectra are wavelength and flux - calibrated .",
    "the spectral indicators ( primarily the 4000  break and the h@xmath0 index ) and the emission lines ( the equivalent widths and fluxes of h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 ) that are discussed in this paper are calculated using a special - purpose code described in detail in tremonti et al ( 2002 , in preparation ) . here",
    "we provide a brief summary of the main features of the code .",
    "galaxies display a very rich stellar absorption line spectrum , which encodes much information about their stellar populations , but complicates measurements of nebular emission lines . in most early - type galaxies , the [ oii ] ,",
    "[ oiii ] , and h@xmath35 emission lines are similar in strength to fluctuations produced by the many superposed stellar absorption features .",
    "although late - type galaxies tend to have stronger emission lines and spectra dominated by hotter , more featureless stars , stellar balmer absorption can still be substantial ( 2 - 4   at h@xmath36 ) .",
    "we therefore perform a careful subtraction of the stellar absorption line spectrum before measuring the nebular emission lines .",
    "this is accomplished by fitting the emission line free regions of the spectrum with a model spectrum .",
    "the models are based on the new population synthesis code of bruzual & charlot ( 2002 , in preparation , hereafter bc2002 ) which incorporates high resolution ( 3   fwhm ) stellar libraries .",
    "( salient details of the libraries are discussed further in section 3 ) .",
    "we have generated a set of 39 template spectra spanning a wide range in age and metallicity .",
    "the template spectra are convolved with a gaussian to match the stellar velocity dispersion of each galaxy and rebinned to the sdss dispersion ( @xmath37log@xmath38= @xmath39 ) .",
    "the best fitting model spectrum is constructed from a non - negative linear combination of the template spectra , with dust attenuation modeled as a @xmath40 power law of adjustable amplitude ( charlot & fall 2000 ) .    in fig . 1 , we plot two representative sdss galaxy spectra over the wavelength interval 3700 - 4400    ( restframe ) , which includes both the 4000    break and the h@xmath27 absorption features that are used extensively in this paper . the upper panel in fig .",
    "1 shows the spectrum of a star - forming galaxy with strong balmer emission lines , while the lower panel shows a typical early - type galaxy with strong stellar absorption features .",
    "the red lines in fig.1 show the best fit model to the stellar absorption spectrum over the wavelength interval from 3600 to 6800  .",
    "we find that in general , the bc2002 models reproduce the main stellar absorption features of galaxies in the sdss survey extremely well .    a more detailed analysis of the spectral fits will be presented in tremonti et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "we note that the top panel of fig .",
    "1 demonstrates that in star forming galaxies , high resolution models are _ required _ in order to separate the balmer emission lines from the underlying stellar absorption features in a reliable way . without these models ,",
    "the accuracy of the emission line measurements is compromised by an unknown correction for stellar absorption .",
    "likewise , stellar continuum indices such as h@xmath0 will be contaminated by emission - lines unless these can be removed .",
    "all magnitudes quoted in this paper are petrosian magnitudes . for the sdss",
    ", the petrosian radius is defined as the largest radius at which the local @xmath30-band surface brightness is at least one fifth the mean surface brightness interior to that radius .",
    "the petrosian flux is then the total flux within a circular aperture two times the petrosian radius .",
    "details about the petrosian flux measurements are given in lupton et al ( 2002 ) and strauss et al ( 2002 ) . the sdss",
    "petrosian magnitude detects essentially all the light from galaxies with exponential profiles and more than 80% of the light from galaxies with de vaucouleurs profiles .",
    "conversions from apparent magnitude to absolute magnitude depend on cosmology through the distance modulus dm(z ) and on galaxy type through the k - correction k(z ) : @xmath41 we assume a friedman - robertson - walker cosmology with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and h@xmath44= 70 km s @xmath45 mpc@xmath45 .",
    "we calculate the k - corrections @xmath46 for each galaxy using the routines in kcorrect v1_11 ( blanton et al .",
    "2002 ) . in order to minimize the errors in this procedure ,",
    "we k - correct the magnitudes of all galaxies in our sample to @xmath47 , which is close to the median redshift of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "blanton et al .",
    "have studied the errors in the k - corrections by comparing the magnitudes produced by the kcorrect routine with broad - band magnitudes synthesized from the galaxy spectra themselves .",
    "the conclusion is that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 band magnitudes can be reconstructed to the level of the photometry ( @xmath48 1 % ) .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath33-band magnitudes have considerably larger errors ( 5% and 20% , respectively ) .",
    "we will not consider @xmath33-band magnitudes in this paper .",
    "the break occurring at 4000  is the strongest discontinuity in the optical spectrum of a galaxy and arises because of the accumulation of a large number of spectral lines in a narrow wavelength region .",
    "the main contribution to the opacity comes from ionized metals . in hot stars , the elements are multiply ionized and the opacity decreases ,",
    "so the 4000  break will be small for young stellar populations and large for old , metal - rich galaxies .",
    "a break index d(4000 ) was defined by bruzual ( 1983 ) as the ratio of the average flux density f@xmath49 in the bands 4050 - 4250  and 3750 - 3950  .",
    "a definition using narrower continuum bands ( 3850 - 3950  and 4000 - 4100  ) was recently introduced by balogh et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "the principal advantage of the narrow definition is that the index is considerably less sensitive to reddening effects .",
    "we will adopt the narrow definition as our standard in this paper and we denote this index as d@xmath6(4000 ) .",
    "strong h@xmath27 absorption lines arise in galaxies that experienced a burst of star formation that ended @xmath50 gyr ago .",
    "the peak occurs once hot o and b stars , which have weak intrinsic absorption , have terminated their evolution .",
    "the optical light from the galaxies is then dominated by late - b to early - f stars .",
    "worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) defined an h@xmath0 index using a central bandpass bracketed by two pseudo - continuum bandpasses .",
    "they parametrized the strength of this feature as a function of stellar effective temperature , gravity and metallicity using the lick / ids spectral library ( gorgas et al .",
    "a similar calibration of the 4000  break strength has been carried out by gorgas et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "most currently available stellar population synthesis models have very low spectral resolution .",
    "the resolution of the lick / ids spectral library is 9  a factor of 4 lower than that of the sdss spectra .",
    "the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) models have a 20    spectral resolution , far too low to measure the h@xmath27 absorption feature and d@xmath6(4000 ) index reliably .",
    "high resolution stellar spectral libraries spanning a wide range in metallicity , spectral type and luminosity class have only recently become available .",
    "the stelib library ( le borgne et al 2002 ) consists of over 250 stars spanning a range of metallicities from 0.05 to 2.5 times solar , a range of spectral types from o5 to m9 and luminosity classes from i to v. the coverage in spectral type is not uniform at all metallicities : hot ( @xmath51 k ) stars of sub - solar metallicity are under - represented , and the library lacks very cool ( @xmath52 k ) stars of all metallicities .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range from 3500 to 9500    with a resolution of 3    fwhm and a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath53 .",
    "most of the stars in the library were selected from the catalogue of cayrel de strobel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which contains fe / h determinations obtained from high resolution spectroscopic observations .",
    "the selection of stars was optimized to provide good coverage of the hr diagram .",
    "this stellar library has now been incorporated in the latest version of the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) population synthesis code .",
    "a full description of the code and of the new stellar library will be presented elsewhere ( bruzual & charlot 2002 ) . a description of the underlying stellar evolution prescriptions used in these models ( stellar evolutionary tracks and their semi - empirical extensions ) can be found in liu , charlot & graham ( 2000 ) .",
    "the evolution of the d@xmath6(4000 ) and h@xmath0 indices following an instantaneous burst of star formation is illustrated in fig .",
    "the left panels show the evolution of the two indices for a solar metallicity single - age stellar population ( ssp ) . in order to assess how much systematic uncertainty",
    "there is in the calibration of these two indices , we have compared model predictions using 3 different empirical stellar libraries : 1 ) the stelib library with 3    resolution ( le borgne et al 2002 ) , 2 ) the pickles ( 1998 ) library with 5   resolution , and 3 ) the jacoby , hunter & christensen ( 1984 ) library with 4.5   resolution .",
    "our results show that at fixed metallicity and age , the variations in the behaviour of the indices due to differences in the input stellar libraries are @xmath54 for the d@xmath55 index and @xmath56    for h@xmath0 . for very old stellar populations , the systematic differences are somewhat larger .",
    "in the right panels , we compare the evolution of the two indices for ssps of differing metallicity .",
    "results are shown only for the stelib library .",
    "there are no other high - resolution libraries of stars of non - solar metallicity that span a wide range in wavelength , spectral type and luminosity class , so we are unable to to carry out an analysis of systematic effects for non - solar models .",
    "as can be seen , the evolution of d@xmath6(4000 ) does not depend strongly on metallicity until ages of more than @xmath57 years after the burst .",
    "the strongest dependence of the h@xmath0 index on metallicity also occurs at old ages .",
    "the calibration in fig.2 does not take into account the effects of the velocity dispersion of the stars in galaxies .",
    "we tested whether this would make any difference to our index calibrations and we find that the effects on h@xmath0 and d@xmath6(4000 ) are negligible ( we note that this is _ not _ true for all the lick indices ) .",
    "although the time evolution of the d@xmath6(4000 ) and h@xmath0 indices does depend on metallicity , the _ locus _ of galaxies in the d@xmath6(4000)/h@xmath0 plane is not as sensitive to metallicity and is a powerful diagnostic of whether galaxies have been forming stars continuously or in bursts over the past 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "in addition , these two stellar indices are largely insensitive to the dust attenuation effects that complicate the interpretation of broadband colours . in fig .",
    "3 we plot h@xmath0 as a function of d@xmath6(4000 ) for `` pure burst '' star formation histories and for continuous star formation histories spanning a large range of formation times @xmath58 and exponential star formation timescales .",
    "results are shown for three different metallicities . as can be seen ,",
    "the continuous models occupy a narrow band in the d@xmath6(4000)/h@xmath0 plane .",
    "galaxies with stronger h@xmath0 absorption strength at a given value of d@xmath6(4000 ) must have formed some fraction of their stars in a recent burst .    in fig 3 .",
    "we also show the region of the d@xmath6(4000)/h@xmath0 plane populated by sdss galaxies .",
    "we show the subset of galaxies for which the error in the measured value of h@xmath0 is less than 0.8  and the error in the d@xmath6(4000 ) index is less than @xmath59 .",
    "this cut includes @xmath4825,000 galaxies or 20% of the total sample .",
    "the mean errors on the d@xmath6(4000 ) and h@xmath0 indices for the full sample are 0.048 and 1.4    respectively .",
    "we have corrected the h@xmath0 measurements for contamination due to nebular emission .",
    "because the h@xmath27 emission is so much weaker than that at h@xmath35 or h@xmath36 , even in the dust - free case , the most robust way to correct for it is to scale directly from the measured h@xmath35 flux .",
    "we use the difference between the observed h@xmath35/h@xmath36 emission line fluxes and the dust - free case - b recombination value ( 2.86 ) to calculate the attenuation of the emission lines .",
    "we assume an attenuation law of the form @xmath60 ( charlot & fall 2000 ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the emission correction to the @xmath61 index .",
    "we apply this correction to all galaxies where the h@xmath35 and @xmath62 emission lines are measured with s / n@xmath63 .",
    "the typical emission correction to h@xmath0 for late - type galaxies with d@xmath6(4000)@xmath64 is around 1  . for early - type galaxies ,",
    "it is smaller .",
    "we have also corrected the d@xmath6(4000 ) index for contamination by the [ neiii ] emission line at 3869  .",
    "this only affects a very small fraction of galaxies  mainly seyfert iis .",
    "3 shows that there is good agreement between the area of the d@xmath6(4000)/h@xmath0 plane populated by real galaxies and the values predicted by the population synthesis models .",
    "we now investigate the effect of different star formation histories on the estimated stellar mass - to - light ratios of our galaxies .",
    "we use a bayesian technique to derive estimates of the stellar mass - to - light ratios , dust attenuation corrections and burst mass fractions for each galaxy in our sample .",
    "we also derive associated confidence intervals for each of these parameters .",
    "a generalized description of the mathematical basis of our technique is given in appendix a.    in bayesian statistics , an initial assumption is made that the data are randomly drawn from a distribution , which is a family of models characterized by a parameter vector * p*. one has to specify a prior distribution on the space of all possible * p*. this is a probability density distribution that encodes knowledge about the relative likelihood of various * p * values in the absence of any data .",
    "typically one takes a uniform prior in parameters with a small dynamic range and a uniform prior in the logarithm of parameters with a large dynamic range .",
    "we set up our prior distribution by generating a library of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories .",
    "it is important that our library of models span the full range of physically plausible star formation histories , and that it be uniform in the sense that all histories are reasonably represented and no a priori implausible corner of parameter space accounts for a large fraction of the models .    in our library , each star formation history consists of two parts :    1 .",

    "we take @xmath58 to be distributed uniformly over the interval from the big bang to 1.5 gyr before the present day and @xmath65 over the interval 0 to 1 .",
    "we do not allow star formation rates that increase with time ( @xmath67 ) because these are very similar to bursts .",

    "the fact that our models are distributed inhomogeneously in the d@xmath6(4000)/h@xmath0 plane has a significant impact on the confidence intervals we derive for our parameters .",

    "the middle galaxy lies well away from the locus of continuous star formation models .",
    "d@xmath6(4000 ) and h@xmath0 are both measured with high accuracy . as a result , our derived probability distribution indicates that this galaxy _ must _ have formed more than about 25% of its stars in a recent burst .",
    "the value of @xmath77 is not very well constrained .",
    "this reflects the so - called age / mass degeneracy : a large burst that occurred long ago is indistinguishable from a smaller burst that occurred more recently .",
    "the bottom galaxy lies away from the locus of continuous models , but the error on its h@xmath0 index is much larger than that of the middle galaxy .",

    "the scatter in @xmath104 at fixed luminosity decreases at longer wavelengths : it is more than a factor of two larger in the @xmath29-band than in the @xmath32-band .    in order to make some comparison to related work ,",
    "we have plotted as a thick solid line the mean relation between @xmath105 and @xmath30-band magnitude derived by bernardi et al ( 2002 ) for a sample of early - type galaxies drawn from the sdss . in this analysis @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the effective radius of the galaxy and @xmath78 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the stars measured in a 3 arcsecond aperture .",
    "it is interesting that the relation derived by bernardi et al agrees well with our @xmath104 estimates for less luminous galaxies , but lies above our estimates for brighter galaxies .",
    "this may be an indication that more luminous galaxies contain more dark matter than less luminous galaxies .",
    "we caution , however , that a more careful analysis is required because the bernardi et al sample is carefully selected to contain only galaxies with pure early - type spectra , whereas our sample includes all galaxies .",

    "the d@xmath6(4000 ) and @xmath61 indices measured from the sdss spectra reflect the properties of the starlight that found its way down a 3 arcsecond diameter fibre that has been positioned as close as possible to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "one may thus wonder to what extent our estimates of @xmath110 may be biased because the index measurements are not accurately reflecting the stellar content of the whole galaxy . in particular , aperture bias could well be a serious problem for spiral galaxies , where the index measurements may be appropriate for the central bulge component , but not for the outer disk where most of the star formation is taking place .",
    "it is possible to address the effect of aperture bias in a statistical way by comparing the observed stellar indices and the derived @xmath111 values for similar galaxies viewed at different distances from us .",

    "more distant galaxies have younger stellar populations than nearby objects , as expected if the spectra are preferentially sampling the bulges of nearby galaxies .    fig .",
    "17 shows how the dust attenuation in the z - band varies as a function of distance .",
    "our results indicate that @xmath95 increases towards the centres of low luminosity galaxies , but in galaxies with luminosities @xmath116 , the attenuation increases towards the outer regions . in the most luminous galaxies in our sample , the attenuation does not appear to vary strongly as a function of radius .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these trends is that our low - luminosity sample is dominated by disk galaxies , which are known to have have significant metallicity gradients ( e.g. zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra 1994 ) .",
    "if dust content correlates with metallicity , one might expect the light from stars in the inner parts of these galaxies to be more attenuated .",
    "galaxies with luminosities @xmath116 are composite systems consisting of both a bulge and a disk ; starlight from the bulge is expected to be less attenuated than that from the disk .",

    "a sample of galaxies with large aperture spectra is required for this purpose .",

    "we have developed a new method to constrain the past star formation histories of galaxies .",

    "together these two indices allow us to place constraints on the mean age of the stellar population of a galaxy and the fraction of its stellar mass formed in recent bursts .",
    "we have generated a library of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories , which includes bursting as well as continuous models and a wide range of metallicities .",
    "we use the library to generate estimates and confidence intervals for a variety of parameters for a sample of 122,808 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey , these include :    1 .   @xmath77 the fraction of the stellar mass of the galaxy formed in bursts in the past two gyr .",

    "for example , the luminosity - weighted or mass - weighted mean stellar ages have large errors , because of the rather strong dependence of the 4000  break on metallicity at ages of more than 1 - 2 gyr ( see fig .",
    "in the first part of the paper , we have illustrated in detail how our methods can be applied to galaxies in the sdss and we have estimated the confidence with which we can constrain basic parameters such as stellar mass . in the second part of the paper ,",
    "we have presented a number of astrophysically interesting applications of our methods .",
    "we have shown that the attenuation of the @xmath32-band light due to dust depends strongly on both the absolute magnitude and the mean stellar age of a galaxy .",
    "we have also studied the distribution of stellar mass - to - light ratios of galaxies as a function of absolute magnitude in the four sdss pass bands .",
    "we have shown that the distribution of @xmath111 is strongly dependent on galaxy luminosity in all photometric bands .",
    "almost all very luminous galaxies have high mass - to - light ratios .",
    "faint galaxies have lower mass - to - light ratios , but also span a wider range in @xmath111 .",
    "we have also shown that the scatter in @xmath111 at a given luminosity is a factor of @xmath109 smaller in the @xmath32-band than it is in the @xmath29-band .",
    "finally , we have computed how galaxies of different types contribute to the total stellar mass budget of the universe .    in the standard paradigm for structure formation in the universe ,",
    "galaxy formation occurs hierarchically through the merging of small protogalactic condensations to form more and more massive systems . in this picture , the contribution of different kinds of galaxies to the stellar mass budget is expected to evolve strongly with redshift .",
    "the rate and form of this evolution depend not only on the values of cosmological parameters such as @xmath149 and @xmath150 , but also on the physical processes that control the rate at which stars form in galaxies .",
    "for example , if star formation rates are enhanced during galaxy - galaxy mergers , the fraction of stars formed in recent bursts should rise strongly with redshift , simply because merging rates and gas fractions were higher in the past ( see for example kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "although it is now clear that the integrated star formation rate density increases strongly to higher redshifts ( madau et al 1996 ) , it is still not understood which galaxies undergo the strongest evolution or which physical processes cause galaxies to form stars more rapidly in the past . in the next few years",
    ", there will be a number of new large redshift surveys of the faint galaxy population .",
    "these surveys will contain enough galaxies to carry out an inventory of the stellar mass at @xmath151 . when these results are compared with the distributions derived from the sdss , it will be possible to draw quantitative conclusions about how galaxies have evolved over the past two thirds of a hubble time and to begin disentangling the effects of the different processes that may have influenced this evolution .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is a joint project of the university of chicago , fermilab , the institute for advanced study , the japan participation group , the johns hopkins university , los alamos national laboratory , the max - planck - institute for astronomy ( mpia ) , the max - planck - institute for astrophysics ( mpa ) , new mexico state university , princeton university , the united states naval observatory , and the university of washington .",
    "apache point observatory , site of the sdss telescopes , is operated by the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) .",
    "funding for the project has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the sdss member institutions , the national aeronautics and space administration , the national science foundation , the u.s .",
    "department of energy , the japanese monbukagakusho , and the max planck society .",
    "the sdss web site is http://www.sdss.org/.        let us recall the basis of bayesian statistics for this kind of problem .",
    "an initial assumption is made that the data are randomly drawn from a distribution which is a member of a model family characterised by a parameter vector * p*. the dimension of * p * can , in principle , be arbitrarily large",
    ". in particular , it can be much larger than the number of points n in the dataset to be fitted .",
    "the goal is then to use the data to define a likelihood function on the space of all possible * p*. this function can be used to obtain a best estimate and confidence interval for any model property y(*p * ) .",
    "in bayesian statistics one has to specify a prior distribution on the space of all possible * p*. this is a probability density distribution @xmath152(*p * ) which encodes knowledge about the relative likelihood of various * p * values in the absence of any data . for example , the physically accessible range for each element of * p * may be limited .",
    "typically one takes a uniform prior in parameters with a small dynamic range and a uniform prior in the log of parameters with a large dynamic range .        where a is a constant which is adjusted so that @xmath155(*p * @xmath156 normalises correctly to unity and @xmath157 is the probability of the observed dataset on the hypothesis that the underlying distribution is described by the particular parameter set * p*.    the likelihood of the derived parameter y(*p * ) given the data is then @xmath158 where the integral extends over all * p * for which y lies in a specified bin @xmath1dy/2 .",
    "note that there is no regularity requirement on the function y(*p * ) other than piecewise continuity so it makes sense to define a probability density .",
    "the most likely value of y can then be taken as the peak of this distribution ; the most typical value as its median ; the 95% ( symmetric ) confidence interval for scalar y can be defined by excluding the 2.5% tails at each end of the distribution .    when applied to the kinds of problems presented in this paper , the prior",
    "is taken to be the distribution of possible star formation histories in the comparison library , which can be viewed as a monte carlo sampling of @xmath159 .",
    "the integral in the above expression for the likelihood of y is then trivially evaluated through binning the integrand as a function of y. the expression for @xmath160 is also straightforward for our case , since we have a measure of each element of * d * and we can assume the errors are normal with known correlation matrix c. in this situation        it is worth noting that this procedure makes no assumptions about the shapes of the distributions @xmath159 , @xmath164 or @xmath165 .",
    "the first can be assumed at will , and for small error bars and a well constrained problem should have little effect on the answer .",
    "the other two are then derived consistently .",
    "the important assumptions are that the model makes a well defined and specific prediction for the value of the observable in the absence of observational errors ( in practice there will be some degree of theoretical uncertainty and this could be included in c if it can be modelled as gaussian ) and that the observed data * d * have a known observational error which can be assumed gaussian with covariance matrix c."
