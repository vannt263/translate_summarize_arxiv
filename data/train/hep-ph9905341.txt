    "in certain high  energy scattering processes involving charged particles and the emission of one or more photons , the scattering amplitude vanishes for particular configurations of the final  state particles .",
    "such configurations are known as _ radiation zeros _ or _",
    "null zones_. the study of these radiation zeros ( raz ) dates back to the late 1970s @xcite , where they were identified in the process @xmath3 as points in phase - space for which the total cross section vanishes .",
    "+ today @xcite it is understood that the zeros are due to a cancellation which can be regarded as a destructive interference of radiation patterns induced by the charge of the participating particles .",
    "the fact that gauge symmetry is a vital ingredient for the cancellation to occur means that radiation zeros can be used to probe physics beyond the standard model .",
    "for example , ` anomalous ' electroweak gauge boson couplings destroy the delicate cancellations necessary for a zero to occur .",
    "+ in recent years there have been many studies exploring the phenomenological aspects of radiation zeros , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . experimental evidence for the zeros predicted in @xcite has also been found at the fermilab tevatron @xmath4 collider @xcite . + as already mentioned , the classic process for radiation zeros in high - energy hadron - hadron collisions is @xmath3 , where the zero occurs in a ` visible ' region of phase space , i.e. away from the phase - space boundaries .",

    "+ in this paper we study in detail the @xmath7 process , and identify the circumstances under which radiation zeros occur . unlike the @xmath8 process , it is not possible to write down a simple analytic expression for the matrix element squared .",
    "however , making use of the soft - photon approximation does allow the zeros to be identified analytically , and a numerical calculation of the full matrix element confirms that although the actual zeros disappear for non - zero photon energies , deep dips do persist for all relevant photon energies .",
    "the dips result from delicate cancellations between the various standard model photon emission diagrams , and are ` filled in ' by contributions from non - standard gauge boson couplings .",
    "we illustrate this explicitly using anomalous quartic couplings .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in the following section we review the ` classic ' radiation - zero process , @xmath9 . in section  3 we extend the analysis to @xmath2 production , first using analytic methods in the soft - photon limit .",

    "( [ tan ] ) ) . for non - zero photon energies",
    "the zeros disappear , but for energies not too large the photon angular distribution still exhibits deep dips centred on the positions of the soft - photon zeros .",
    "the subtle cancellations leading to the zeros in the soft - photon limit still takes place , but for non - soft photons two additional diagrams ( 9 and 18 ) have to be considered and @xmath113 is exactly that contribution . in the  classic  process @xmath154",
    "there are no further diagrams for non - soft photons and the zeros survive for all photon energies .",
    "although we have concentrated on the quark scattering process @xmath155 our results apply equally well to @xmath156 by setting @xmath157 .",
    "note that , as for quark antiquark scattering , the zeros in the @xmath51 ( soft - photon ) case are in the ` visible ' regions of phase space , in contrast to those in the analogous ` classical ' process @xmath158 .",
    "furthermore for @xmath51 scattering diagram 9 ( scattering via @xmath143-channel exchange ) is not present and direct access to the four boson vertex is given for non - soft photons , i.e. the four boson vertex is the only contribution to the cross section at the position of the zeros .",
    "+ we have also studied the effect of including non - zero anomalous quartic couplings",
    ". these contributions increase with increasing photon energy and fill in the dips present in the standard model . in principle , therefore , the vicinity of the radiation zeros is the most sensitive part of phase space to these anomalous four boson couplings .",
    "+ our analysis has been entirely theoretical .",
    "having established that there _ are _ regions of phase space where the cross section is heavily suppressed , the next step is to see to what extent the phenomenon persists when hadronisation , radiative corrections , smearing , boost , detector etc .",
    "effects are taken into account , in the context , for example , of a possible measurement at the tevatron or lhc hadron colliders . in this respect ,",
