    "recently a classification of tensors on lorentzian manifolds of arbitrary dimensions was introduced @xcite . when applied to the weyl tensor @xcite , in four dimensions it reduces to the well known petrov classification , in higher dimensions it leads to a similar , dimensionally independent classification scheme ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this classification is based on the existence of preferred null directions ",
    "weyl aligned null directions ( wands ) and corresponding principal null congruences in a given spacetime ( see section [ classif ] for details ) . in 4 dimensions wands",
    "correspond to principal null directions of the weyl tensor .",
    "the petrov classification in four dimensions was very useful for generating algebraically special exact solutions as well as for physical interpretation of spacetimes .",
    "ultimately , one would like to use the higher dimensional classification for similar purposes as in classical relativity , however , while in higher dimensions some properties related to the classification remain the same as in four dimensions , other differ .",
    "for example , it was proven that for all vacuum spacetimes of types iii and n in arbitrary dimension the principal null congruence is geodesic as in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "this congruence in four dimensions is in addition shear - free but in higher dimensions shear may not vanish ( see @xcite for additional comments on the goldberg - sachs theorem in higher dimensions ) .",
    "also all spacetimes with vanishing curvature invariants are necessarily of types iii and n in arbitrary dimension , including four @xcite .",
    "black holes are another interesting example .",
    "first let us point out that the kerr solution as well as the myers - perry solution in five dimensions are of type d with geodesic principal null congruences @xcite .",
    "more general black holes in four dimensions can be algebraically general , however , if the horizon is isolated , the spacetime is of type ii locally on the horizon @xcite .",
    "recently , it was proven that locally , on the isolated horizon , the algebraic type is ii also in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "a vacuum , asymptotically flat , stationary black hole solution with a horizon of topology @xmath1 - so called black ring - was discovered recently in @xcite .",
    "there exist black holes of spherical topology and black rings with the same values of the conserved quantities @xmath2 and @xmath3 and thus black holes in higher dimensions are not uniquely characterized by their mass and angular momenta and uniqueness theorems can not be ( straightforwardly ) generalized for higher dimensions .    in this paper it is shown that while the myers - perry solution representing a spherical black hole is of type d , black rings , while still algebraically special , belong to the more general class @xmath4 . in section",
    "[ classif ] the classification of the weyl tensor in higher dimensions is overviewed and necessary conditions for various classes , which significantly simplify search for wands , are determined . in section [ secring ]",
    "we briefly overview the ( neutral ) black ring solution and analyze some of its properties . in section [ secbrclass ] we classify static and stationary black rings . in four dimensions it is possible to determine algorithmically an algebraic type of a solution using various invariants and covariants of the metric ( see e.g. chapter 9 in @xcite ) .",
    "since such a method is not developed in higher dimensions , it is necessary to find wands explicitly .",
    "components of the weyl tensor for the black ring are quite complicated and thus corresponding necessary conditions are also complicated even with the use of maple ( however , much simpler than alignment equations ) .",
    "we thus limit ourselves to presenting only their solutions and indicating the procedure how to obtain them .",
    "we also explicitly show that locally on the horizon the weyl tensor is of type ii .",
    "in this section , algebraic classification of the weyl tensor in higher dimensions developed in @xcite is briefly summarized and at the end necessary conditions for various algebraic types are introduced .",
    "we will work in the frame = ,   = ,   ,  i , j , k = 2  d-1 , with two null vectors @xmath5 ^a",
    "_ a= n^a n_a = 0 ,   ^a n_a = 1 ,   a = 0  d-1 , and @xmath6 spacelike vectors @xmath7 m^(i)am^(j)_a=_ij ,  m^(i)a_a=0=m^(i)an_a ,  i , j , k = 2  d-1 , where the metric has the form g_a b = 2 _ ( an_b ) + _ ij m^(i)_a m^(j)_b .",

    "a quantity @xmath8 has a _ boost weight _",
    "@xmath9 if it transforms under a boost according to @xmath10 .",
    "_ boost order _ of a tensor @xmath11 is defined as the maximum boost weight of its frame components and it can be shown that it depends only on the choice of a null direction @xmath12 ( see proposition iii.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "for a given tensor @xmath11 , @xmath13 denotes the maximum value of @xmath14 taken over all null vectors @xmath15",
    ". then a null vector @xmath15 is _ aligned _ with the tensor @xmath11 whenever @xmath16 and the integer @xmath17 is called _ order of alignment_. the classification of tensors @xcite is based on the existence of such aligned null vectors of various orders .",
    "namely , for the weyl tensor the _ primary alignment type _ is g if there are no null vectors aligned with the weyl tensor and the primary alignment type is 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 if the maximally aligned null vector has order of alignment 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , respectively .",
    "once @xmath12 is fixed as an aligned null vector of maximal order of alignment , one can search for @xmath18 with maximal order of alignment subject to the constraint @xmath19 and similarly define _ secondary alignment types_.    let us introduce the operation \\ { } which allows us to construct a basis in the space of weyl - like tensors by w_\\{a x_b y_c z_d } ( w_[a x_b ] y_[c z_d]+ w_[c x_d ] y_[a z_b ] ) .",

    "the weyl tensor is of type i if there exist such @xmath20 that we can set all components of boost weight 2 , @xmath21 , to zero using the transformation ( [ nullrot ] ) .",
    "it is of type ii if we can set boost order 2 and boost order 1 components to zero and so on . resulting polynomial equations for @xmath20 depend on the original choice of the frame @xmath22 and can be considerably simplified if the frame is chosen appropriately .",
    "however , there is no general method how to make such a choice .",
    "for this reason we investigate another method , which involves only the vector @xmath12 instead of the frame @xmath22 .    in four dimensions ,",
    "the following equivalences for principal null directions hold ( see e.g. @xcite )    [ cols=\">,^ , < \" , ]",

    "in this section we classify the black ring solution and its various special cases .",
    "our method is to solve the necessity conditions ( [ hdnecessity ] ) and then check that these solutions indeed represent wands by calculating components of the weyl tensor in an appropriate frame .",
    "it turns out that the second equation in ( [ hdnecessity ] ) admits two independent solutions l _ = ( _ t - _ ) ( _ x + _ y ) .",
    "[ pndmp ] when we choose a frame with @xmath64 and @xmath65 all components of the weyl tensor with boost weights 2,1,-1,-2 vanish and the spacetime is thus of type d. these two vectors were given in boyer - lindquist coordinates in @xcite and further discussed in app .",
    "d in @xcite .",
    "the second equation in ( [ hdnecessity ] ) admits a solution l=_v- _ x. one can check that boost order of the weyl tensor in the frame with @xmath66 is 0 and thus the black ring is of the type ii on the horizon .      in order to solve the first equation in ( [ hdnecessity ] ) i_eadf = ^b ^c ^[e c^a ]   [ d _  bc ^f]=0 , [ bri ] we denote ^a= ( , , , , ) [ wand ] and from ( [ bri ] ) we obtain a set of fourth order polynomial equations in @xmath67 .",
    "an additional second order equation follows from @xmath68 .",
    "since components of the weyl tensor are quite complicated , it is not surprising that these equations are also complicated .",
    "however , one can pick some of them which are relatively simple .",
    "let us start with the static case .",
    "i_xy=-=0 imply that unless @xmath70 equals to -1,0 or 1 , at least one component of the wand ( [ wand ] ) vanishes .",

    "note that a vector as well as its arbitrary multiple represent the same wand .",
    "we can thus set one component of ( [ wand ] ) equal to a given number .",
    "let us set @xmath73 .",
    "now we can solve ( [ qdstatic ] ) for @xmath74 .",
    "it has in general two real roots , however , only one of them leads to positive values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 as given by ( [ eqastatic ] ) and ( [ eqdstatic ] ) .",
    "let us denote this root by @xmath77 and corresponding square roots of right hand sides of ( [ eqastatic ] ) and ( [ eqdstatic ] ) as @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "note also that @xmath80 , @xmath81 satisfy ( [ qdstatic ] ) as well as @xmath82 , @xmath73 and that this change does not affect values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we thus arrive at four distinct wands @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the static black ring is thus of principal type i. furthermore , if we choose a frame with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we can see that all components with boost weight 2 and -2 vanish and thus the type is @xmath87 .      linear combination ( x-1 ) ( x+1 ) ( -1+x ) i_t y - ( y-1 ) ( 1 + ) ( -1+y ) i_t x = 0 leads to \\ { & & ( x - y ) ^2 ( -1+x ) + _ r _ ( y^2 - 1 ) + & + & _ r _ ( 1+y ) } = 0 .",
    "[ rcea ] assuming @xmath88 and @xmath89 , ( [ rcea ] ) is a linear equation for @xmath90 and by substituting the result in @xmath91 we obtain the quadratic equation for @xmath74 and @xmath92 \\ { & & -^2 ( y^2 - 1 ) ( -1+y ) ( -1+y ) ( -1+x ) -^2 ( x^2 - 1 ) ( -1+x ) ^2 ( -1+x ) + & & + } = 0 .",
    "now the equation @xmath93 is linear in @xmath76 and using ( [ rcea ] ) we can express @xmath76 in terms of @xmath94 .",
