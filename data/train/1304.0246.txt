    "the genetic information of the organism is encoded into its genome which , for our purposes is a chain of @xmath29 sites . with time",

    "if we suppose that there are only two possible alleles on each site , it makes sense when looking at the genome to only record whether the allele carried at a given site is the original one ( the `` wild type '' ) or the mutant .",
    "we will represent a genetic type by a sequence of 0 s and 1 s of length @xmath29 where we put a 0 at position @xmath30 if this site carries the original code or a 1 if it carries the mutant .",
    "hence , a genetic type is a point @xmath31 , the @xmath29-dimensional hypercube .",
    "this is a classical way of encoding the possible evolutionary states of a populations .",
    "for instance , in their seminal article @xcite kauffman and levin write :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   _ consider as a concrete example , a space of @xmath32 peptides constrained to use two amino acids , say leucine and alanine . then 1 and 0",

    "each genetic type @xmath33 is characterized by a certain fitness value @xmath34 .",
    "assume that the population is in a regime with a low mutation rate and strong selection ; this means that when a new genetic type ( mutant ) appears in a resident population , it must either fixates ( i.e. it invades the whole population and becomes the resident type ) if it has better fitness or become extinct ( i.e. no one in the population carries this type after some time ) if its fitness is lower .",
    "therefore , in that low mutation and strong selection regime , the only possible evolutionary paths are such that the fitness is always increasing .",
    "we say that such paths are _ open_. in biology , paths with increasing fitness values are also referred to as selectively accessible ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the idea that the population moves as a whole along the vertices of the hypercube is also classical and can be found in @xcite or in @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ one can think of the adaptive process as a continuous time , discrete state markov process , in which the entire population is resident at one state and then jumps with fixed probabilities to each of its 1-step mutant fitter variants . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    somewhere in the @xmath29-dimensional hypercube , there is a type with the highest fitness .",
    "we call @xmath11 the distance between that type and the original one ; i.e. @xmath11 is the number of mutated alleles in the fittest type .",
    "a natural question is whether there is an open path from the original type to the fittest .",
    "such a path has at least @xmath11 steps but may contain many more .",
    "because of the low mutation rate , evolution takes time , and we interest ourselves here only in the _ shortest _ open paths leading to the fittest type , that is in the paths with exactly @xmath11 steps , for which mutation never goes back : a site can only change from the original type to the mutant one .    in that setting , it is thus sufficient to consider the @xmath11-dimensional hypercube which contains ( as opposing nodes ) the original type , noted @xmath16 and the fittest type @xmath35 .",
    "we consider paths through that hypercube along the edges which always move further away from the origin ( i.e. at each step a 0 is changed into a 1 in the sequence ) and , out of the @xmath36 possible paths , we wish to count the number  @xmath6 of open paths , that is the number of paths such that the fitness values form an increasing sequence which represent a possible evolutionary history of the organism towards its optimum fitness .",
    "to count the number of open paths , we need to have a model for the fitness values @xmath26 of all the nodes .",
    "there are many choices as to how to do this .",
    "one could for instance chose @xmath26 to be the number of ones in @xmath37 . in that case",
    "all direct paths from @xmath21 to @xmath22 are accessible .",
    "however this corresponds to a very smooth , linear _ fitness landscape _ which does not match observations .    instead",
    ", our choice is to pick the fitness values as independent random variables with a common distribution .",
    "as we are only interested in whether a sequence is increasing or not , the results will not depend on the specific distribution ( as long as it is atom - less ) .",
    "we therefore choose to give a fitness  @xmath38 to the fittest node and to assign uniform random numbers between 0 and 1 to each other nodes .",
    "this is the so called `` house of cards '' model , which was introduced by kingman @xcite , which is also @xcite the @xmath39 model studied by @xcite in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "the variant we consider where @xmath28 is not randomly picked but fixed to a given value @xmath18 has also been considered recently @xcite .",
    "the correlation structure of the hypercube raises significant technical challenges . as a first step , we study the following simplified problem : instead of working on the @xmath11-dimensional hypercube we chose to work on a deterministic rooted tree as in figure  [ figuretree ] with arity decreasing from @xmath11 to 1 : the root is connected to @xmath11 first level nodes , each first level node is connected to @xmath12 second level nodes , etc .",
    "there are @xmath11 levels in the tree and @xmath36 directed paths .",
    "the number of possible steps at level @xmath41 is then @xmath42 , as on the hypercube .",
    "each of the @xmath36 leaves of the tree ( at level @xmath11 ) are assigned the value  1 .",
    "all the other nodes are assigned independent random numbers uniformly drawn between  0 and  1 , except perhaps the root to which we may choose to give a fixed value  @xmath18 .",
    "we are interested in the number @xmath6 of directed paths on the tree going from the root to one of the leaves where the numbers assigned to the visited nodes form an increasing sequence . as before , such a path is said to be open .",
    "we mention that other models of paths with increasing fitness values on trees have also been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath43 we want to describe the law of @xmath6 .",
    "whether we work on the tree or on the hypercube will always be made clear from the context .",
    "the starting position for a path on the tree is the root of the tree ; by abuse of language we call `` root of the hypercube '' the starting position @xmath44 of a path on the hypercube . throughout the paper we use the following notations for the probability of an event and for the expectation and the variance of a number : @xmath45 $ } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that the size @xmath11 of the tree or of the hypercube is implicit in the notation .",
    "the notation @xmath46 , @xmath47 means @xmath48 .    obtaining the expectation of the number of open paths when the starting value has the fixed value @xmath18 is easy",
    ": there are @xmath36 paths in the tree or the hypercube .",
    "each path has probability @xmath49 that the @xmath12 intermediate numbers between the root and the leaf are between @xmath18 and @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , there is probability @xmath50 that these intermediate numbers form an increasing sequence .",
    "hence , the probability that a given path is open is @xmath51 and thus @xmath52 both for the tree and the hypercube .",
    "thus , if @xmath53 there are on average @xmath11 open paths , and if @xmath54 the number of open paths goes in probability to zero when @xmath11 becomes large .",
    "the most biologically relevant variant of the model is when @xmath18 is also randomly picked as the other nodes .",
    "the expectation of @xmath6 ( both on the tree and on the hypercube ) is trivially obtained by integrating : @xmath55 but the typical number of paths for @xmath11 large is not of order 1 , as can be seen by looking on the variance of @xmath6 : @xmath56 ( all the variance computations on the tree are carried out in section  [ sec:2nd ] . ) in fact , this can be understood by considering starting values  @xmath18 scaling with the size @xmath11 of the system as @xmath7 with @xmath57 fixed :    [ p : prop1 ] in the case of the tree , @xmath58 in the case of the hypercube ( hegarty - martinsson 2012 @xcite ) @xmath59    ( note that hegarty - martinsson consider a different scaling regime , but their proof can be adapted without any modification to the result above . )    from proposition  [ p : prop1 ] for @xmath7 and @xmath11 large , the variance of @xmath6 scales like the square of the expectation of @xmath6 .",
    "this means that when the starting value @xmath18 is @xmath60 , the number @xmath6 of open paths is @xmath61 , like its expectation .",
    "when @xmath18 is chosen randomly , there is a probability  @xmath62 that @xmath63 yielding @xmath64 open paths . on average",
    "we thus expect @xmath65 open paths , with a variance @xmath64 , as in .",
    "this heuristic can be made more precise :    on the tree , for a starting value @xmath7 , the variable @xmath8 converges in law when @xmath66 to @xmath10 multiplied by a standard exponential variable .",
    "[ thm : tree ]    on the hypercube , for a starting value @xmath7 , the variable @xmath8 converges in law when @xmath66 to @xmath10 multiplied by the product of two independent standard exponential variables .",
    "[ conj ]    it will become apparent in the proofs that we get a product of two independent variables on the hypercube because , locally near both corners @xmath67 and @xmath68 the hypercube graph looks roughly like the tree .    we conclude with the following remark : when the starting value @xmath18 is picked randomly , even if the expectation and the variance of @xmath6 is dominated by values of @xmath69 , the probability that there exists at least one open path is dominated by starting values @xmath70 .",
    "this was made clear on the hypercube in @xcite and we here state the tree counterpart .",

    "the proofs rely on proposition  [ p : prop1 ] which is itself proven in section  [ sec:2nd ] for the tree . in section  [ sec : cascade ] , we introduce the notion of poisson cascade , which allows to give a probabilistic interpretation of one of the main object introduced in our proofs .",
