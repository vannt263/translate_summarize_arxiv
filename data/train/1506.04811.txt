    "in this paper , we have introduced a generalized evolution variable @xmath33 which is a function of the free parameter @xmath0 taking continuous values .",
    "although the evolution equation governing the qcd radiation in jets takes an equivalent form for each @xmath0 , jet substructure depends on @xmath0 even in the same parton shower formalism .",
    "we have examined the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath22 distributions and the associated jet probability for quark and gluon jets .",
    "this is motivated by the differences found in the prediction for jet substructure observables between often - used monte carlo generators , and also by the fact that recent lhc data related to qcd jet substructure lies between the predictions of the mc generators . the angular - ordered parton shower formalism used in this study",
    "is built upon the one implemented in herwig++ .",
    "we leave further studies based on other recent parton shower formalisms to a future work .",
    "we have studied the distributions of the first , second and third emissions in the momentum fraction @xmath34 and emission angle @xmath35 plane .",
    "these distributions are of importance as the beginning emissions in the jets have a significant impact on @xmath22 and other jet shape observables .",
    "the distributions show a unique emission pattern for each choice of @xmath0 .",
    "we have tuned the parameters in the parton shower to @xmath36 mock data generated using herwig++ , with center of mass energies of @xmath17 gev and @xmath37 gev .",
    "observables used in the tuning are @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 distributions with the jet cone angle @xmath13 . from this fit",
    ", we observe that larger values of the strong coupling are preferred as we vary the values of @xmath0 from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "this is qualitatively in agreement with previous findings regarding the difference between the parton shower phase - space covered by the @xmath40 ordered and angular ordered showering algorithms . using the best fit parameters , we have calculated the @xmath30 distributions of the quark and gluon jets , with @xmath13 and @xmath16 , for @xmath9 collisions at @xmath17 and @xmath41 gev .",
    "as we move away from the setup used for the fits ( namely , quark jets , @xmath13 , @xmath17 gev ) , the @xmath0-dependence becomes more apparent , especially for larger values of @xmath21 in @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence for large @xmath21 implies that wideness of the soft emissions , especially the first ones in a jet are different for each @xmath0 .",
    "we can examine this wideness directly by studying the associated jet probability .",
    "a high probability for having no associated jet simply means that the probability of wide emissions occurring around a hard jet is low .",
    "we have found that the larger @xmath0 is , the larger the no associated jet probability becomes .",
    "this gives us a qualitative understanding of the generator dependence of associated jet rates , especially between pythia8 and herwig++ .",
    "our results open up the possibility that we might be able to reproduce the wideness of jets observed in real data by varying the value of @xmath0 in the evolution variable continuously .",
