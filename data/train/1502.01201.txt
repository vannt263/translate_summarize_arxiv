    "over the past few years , the study of topological states of matters with or without topological order has attracted a lot of attention in the condensed matter community .",
    "the exploration of these new states of matter not only enriches the traditional condensed matter physics , but also has important implications in other branches of physics , such as quantum information science and quantum computing .",
    "@xcite among these topologically nontrivial states , a special class of states , known as the symmetry - protected - topological ( spt ) states , has the special property that while the excitations in the bulk are gapped and trivial , they contain robust gapless edge excitations protected by the symmetries of the system .",
    "a prototypical example of the spt state is the two - dimensional quantum spin hall insulator ( qshi ) which has a finite gap for bulk excitations and two counter - propagating gapless edge modes with opposite spin polarizations .",
    "@xcite this helical edge state is guaranteed to be stable against the weak interaction and disorder due to the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry .",
    "experimental evidences of this unique gapless one - dimensional ( @xmath2d ) quantum liquid are found based the the transport measurements .",
    "@xcite     and @xmath3 located near the helical edge states of a qshi which occupies the @xmath4-plane with @xmath5 .",
    "the local spins can be realized by quantum dots with strong on - site interactions .",
    "both are exchange - coupled to the spin density of the helical edge states , denoted the dashed lines .",
    "the solid lines show the directions of the momenta of the edge states , with the associated spins indicated by the arrows . ]    in addition to the charge transport properties , the spin physics may provide an additional complementary signature of the topological states of matter .",
    "this is particularly interesting for the edge states of the qshi because the spin polarizations are associated with the directions of their momenta .",
    "one way to detect this feature may be provided by the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interaction ,  @xcite which is an effective interaction between two local spins mediated by itinerant electrons in the host metals . a good understanding on it may form the basis for manipulating the quantum states of local spins , which can be crucial for the spintronics and quantum computing .  @xcite with this in mind , it is not surprising that the interplay between the rkky interaction and topological states of matter has attracted a lot of attentions . for examples ,",
    "the rkky interaction on the surface of a three - dimensional topological insulator  @xcite and the edge of a qshi  @xcite have been studied .",
    "more recently , the rkky interaction mediated by helical majorana edge states in a tr - invariant topological superconductor was also investigated .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    ", the rkky interaction mediated by the helical edge sate of the qshi contains an in - plane non - collinear exchange coupling between two local spins , in contrast to the isotropic coupling induced in normal metals .",
    "@xcite    it is known that the hgte quantum wells in which the qshi was first experimentally discovered exhibit some of the largest known rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) among semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "@xcite theoretically , it was also shown that such a coupling in helical liquids leads to interesting new kondo physics .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is desirable to see how the rashba coupling affects the rkky interaction in the helical liquid .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath2d quantum liquid , it is well - known that the electron - electron interaction leads to the breakdown of the fermi liquid picture and the correct low - energy physics is described by luttinger liquid ( ll ) .",
    "@xcite thus , a physically more accurate and realistic description of the rkky interaction in the helical liquid must go beyond the simplest model employed in ref . by taking into account both the above elements .    in this paper",
    ", we consider two local spins exchange - coupled to the spin density of the edge states of a qshi . a schematic setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "we would like to study the effects of the rashba soc and the electron - electron interaction on the rkky interaction in the helical edge states .",
    "since the strength of the rashba coupling can be tuned by an external gate voltage , we expect that the correlations between the two local spins may be affected by the applied gate voltage through the rashba soc .",
    "our main findings are as follows .",
    "( i ) the spin structure of the resulting rkky interaction is fixed by the spin symmetries of the system . with the inclusion of the rashba coupling , it consists of the heisenberg - like , the dzyaloshinskii - moria ( dm ) , and the nematic - type terms .",
    "the last one is absent by turning off the rashba coupling .",
    "all terms contain the range functions of the forms @xmath6 or @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the separation between the two local spins and @xmath9 with the chemical potential @xmath10 and the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath11 .",
    "( ii ) the electron - electron interaction does not affect the spin structure of the rkky interaction because the latter is determined by the spin symmetries of the system .",
    "its only effect is to modify the range functions which become @xmath12 or @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ll parameter and the non - universal constant @xmath15 changes the sign from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "( iii ) by solving the two - impurity problem , we find that there exists a critical strength of the electron - electron interaction corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "at that point a quantum phase transition occurs because of the sign change of the range functions .",
    "( iv ) from the solution of the two - impurity problem , we may examine how the entanglement between the two local spins is affected by the rashba coupling . since the latter can be tuned by the external gate voltage ,",
    "our results provide a way to control the correlations between the two local spins and may have further applications on spintronics and quantum computation .",

    "the only factor that can be changed by the external gate voltage is the chemical potential . by adding the rashba interaction , we have more freedom to control the correlations of local spins which should be important in spintronics and quantum computations .",
    "furthermore , these non - collinear terms may be used to engineer @xmath2d spin models which may exhibit non - trivial spin orders due to the long range nature of the rkky interaction and the presence of the soc .",
    "@xcite    for a non - interacting rashba quantum wire , it has been established that the rkky interaction becomes anisotropic , and thus has a tensorial character .",
    "@xcite moreover , there are different spatial oscillation periods reflecting the presence of different fermi momenta in a rashba quantum wire .",
    "@xcite in the present case , there is only one spatial oscillation period reflecting a unique fermi momentum , which is distinct from the usual rashba quantum wire .",
    "furthermore , practical calculations on the @xmath2d systems such as the rashba quantum wires ,  @xcite the carbon nanotubes ,  @xcite and the graphene nanoribbons ,  @xcite indicate that not all tensor forms will appear in the rkky interaction . especially , the @xmath87 term of the nematic type is unique for the helical liquid with the rashba soc .",
    "the reason is that the helical liquid itself already exhibits a kind of soc even in the absence of the rashba coupling by breaking the spin su(@xmath200 ) symmetry down to the spin u@xmath56(@xmath2 ) symmetry .",
    "the inclusion of the rashba coupling changes the spin symmetry of the system and leads to this nematic type interaction .",
    "finally , we notice that the rkky interaction mediated by the helical majorana edge states of a tr - invariant topological superconductor was discussed in a recent work .",
    "@xcite due to the special feature of majorana fermions , the fermi energy is always pinned at zero such that the spatial oscillation for the usual rkky interaction is absent . in that case , an impurity quantum phase transition was found due to the competition between the exchange interaction mediated by the bulk gapped excitation of the topological superconductor and that mediated by the gapless majorana edge states .",

    "<S> we study the rkky interaction mediated by the helical edge states of a quantum spin hall insulator in the presence of the rashba spin - orbital coupling induced by an external electric field and the electron - electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the presence of the rashba coupling , the rkky interaction induced by the helical edge states contains not only the heisenberg - like and the dzyaloshinskii - moria terms but also the nematic - type term that is not present originally , with the range functions depending on the strength of the rashba coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the electron - electron interaction changes the strength of the rkky interaction by modifying the power of the @xmath0 dependence of the range functions . in particular , by varying the strength of the interaction or the rashba coupling </S>",
    "<S> , there is an ( impurity ) quantum phase transition involving the sign change of the rkky interaction at the value of the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> since both the strength of the rashba coupling and the chemical potential of the helical edge states are electrically controllable by external gate voltages , our results not only shed light on the nature of magnetic impurity correlations in the edge of a two - dimensional topological insulator , but also pave a way to manipulate the qubits in quantum computing . </S>"
