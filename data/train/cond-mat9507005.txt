    "the importance of understanding proteins@xcite has attracted much attention to the statistical mechanics of heterogeneous polymers .",
    "a particular type of heteropolymers built with a random mixture of positively and negatively charged groups along their backbone are called polyampholytes ( pas ) .",
    "the presence of long range electrostatic interactions causes a rather unique behavior in such polymers : the behavior of a single pa with unscreened electrostatic interactions at a low temperature @xmath8 is extremely sensitive to its total ( excess ) charge @xmath9 .",
    "geometrical properties of polymers can be conveniently described by their radius of gyration ( root  mean  squared size ) @xmath10@xcite . at high @xmath8 ,",
    "the effect of electrostatic interactions is small and @xmath10 is approximately equal to that of an uncharged polymer .",
    "however , upon lowering of @xmath8 the pa attempts to take advantage of the presence of two types of charges along its backbone by assuming spatial conformations in which every charge is predominantly surrounded by charges of an opposite sign .",
    "this behavior can be approximately described using a debye ",
    " type theory@xcite , which leads to the conclusion that at low @xmath8 the polymer should collapse into an dense state with condensation energy @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is the number monomers , @xmath12 is the typical charge of a monomer , and @xmath13 is a microscopic distance such as diameter of the monomer . in such a collapsed state ,",
    "@xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "renormalization group inspired scaling arguments showed@xcite that at low @xmath8 one should expect a strongly stretched state with @xmath15 .",
    "this apparent contradiction was resolved by noting@xcite that the low@xmath8 behavior is extremely sensitive to the overall charge @xmath9 : it has been observed@xcite that randomly charged pas with _ vanishing _",
    "indeed collapse at low @xmath8 , while @xmath10 , which is averaged over _ unrestricted _ quenches , grows with decreasing @xmath8 .",
    "such sensitivity is consistent with experimental observations of pas@xcite .    from a detailed study of the @xmath9dependence of @xmath10 ,",
    "the following picture began emerging@xcite : consider a dense ( globular , approximately spherical ) low@xmath8 state of the pa .",
    "its energy can be roughly separated into three terms , as @xmath16 ( in this description we omit the dimensionless prefactors of order unity . )",
    "the first term in this equation represents the debye ",
    "hckel  type condensation energy ,",
    "the second term is the surface energy ( where the surface tension @xmath17 , and the surface area @xmath18 ) , while the last term is the electrostatic energy of the globule of radius @xmath19 . for vanishing @xmath9 ,",
    "the globule remains approximately spherical .",
    "however , when @xmath20 , the electrostatic term exceeds the surface tension term , the spherical shape becomes unstable and the polymer starts to stretch in order to minimize the electrostatic energy .",
    "since the threshold charge @xmath21 increases with @xmath1 exactly as the standard deviation of the total charge @xmath9 in a random sequence of charges , for any @xmath1 there will be a finite portion of chains with @xmath9 exceeding @xmath21 .",
    "( note that this property is specific to three",
    " dimensional electrostatic interactions . for the @xmath1dependence of @xmath21 in general space dimensions , see ref .",
    "while the above arguments suggest that a typical pa should stretch out at low @xmath8 , such stretching may lead to a loss of the condensation energy .",
    "a reasonable compromise between stretching ( which minimizes the electrostatic energy ) and remaining compact ( which gains in condensation energy ) is for the pa to form a _ necklace _ of weakly charged blobs connected with highly charged  necks \" , by taking advantage of the charge fluctuations along the chain .",
    "the results of the monte carlo@xcite and exact enumeration@xcite studies qualitatively support such a picture .",
    "an example of such a low energy configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ paconf ] .",
    "while the exact treatment of electrostatic interactions is not possible , we can pose a simplified problem which , we hope , captures some essential features of this necklace model .",
    "for example , we may ask what the typical size of the largest neutral ( or weakly charged ) segment in a random sequence of @xmath1 charges will be . in order to answer this question , we investigated the size distribution of the largest @xmath22segments ( segments with a total charge @xmath0 ) in such @xmath23mers .",
    "this problem can be mapped to a one - dimensional random walk ( rw ) : the sequence of charges @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , is mapped into a sequence of unit steps in the positive or negative directions along an axis .",
    "the sequence of charges with vanishing total charge @xmath9 now corresponds to a rw which returns to the origin after @xmath1 steps , while a neutral segment inside the sequence of charges corresponds to a loop inside the rw .",
    "similarly , a segment with charge @xmath0 corresponds to a segment ( in the corresponding rw ) whose end is displaced by @xmath0 units from its beginning .",
    "the primary objective of this work is to investigate the probability @xmath26 that the _ largest _ @xmath0segment in an @xmath1step rw has length @xmath2 .",
    "there is an apparent simplicity of the formulation of the problem , i.e. it is similar ( and related ) to the classical rw problems@xcite , such as the problem of first passage times or the problem of last return to the starting point , for which probability distributions can be computed exactly by using the method of reflections@xcite .",
    "however , the search for the _ longest _ segment of the rw , among all possible starting points , creates a more complicated problem .",
    "some of the results presented in this paper have been briefly reported before@xcite . in this work we present a complete exposition of those results , as well as many new results related to this problem and its generalized version . in section [ secdefin ]",
    "we define the problem accurately and argue that in the large @xmath1 limit it can be described in terms of a probability density @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the reduced length and charge , respectively .",
    "this probability density is investigated using monte carlo ( mc ) and exact enumeration methods , as well as by analytical arguments .",
    "in particular , we show that the function @xmath30 has an essential singularity in the @xmath31 limit , and diverges as @xmath32 in the limit @xmath33 . these properties can be easily understood from qualitative arguments presented in section  [ secapprox ] .",
    "in section [ analytic ] we construct an exact integral expression which enables an analytic investigation of certain properties of @xmath27 . in section [ related ]",
    "we show that our problem is related to a different problem of two random walkers ( which we call the `` staircase problem '' ) .",
    "this relation enables us to use the latter problem to investigate the behavior of @xmath30 in the limit @xmath33 .",
    "while some of the properties of @xmath27 can be deduced analytically , we had to complement our results by mc and exact enumeration studies , which appear in almost every section of the paper along with analytical arguments on the subject .",

    "as in the one  dimensional case , @xmath35 corresponds to a loop in the rw .",
    "since the generalized problem investigates the presence of large loops , it is somewhat related to the problem of self  avoiding walks@xcite , whose behavior is also controlled by self  intersections ( i.e. loops ) . in particular , the probability distribution of the @xmath36segments becomes trivial for @xmath37 , when large loops are virtually absent .",
    "in this section , we present an exact definition of the problem of extremal segments of a one dimensional sequence and review the qualitative features of the resulting probability distributions .",

    "we have taken advantage of this fact in order to devise an algorithm that requires only @xmath332 operations to do the job .",
    "the algorithm is as follows :    after the position array @xmath333 is formed , its contents [ which are the position vectors @xmath334 are indexed in lexicographical order .",
    "this operation requires only @xmath332 operations , when an efficient sorting algorithm like heapsort@xcite is used .",
    "all 0segments in the sequence start and end at the same position by definition , therefore the two endpoints will be adjacent in the lexicographical index .",
    "going through the index sequentially , it is then possible to determine the largest of the 0segments in only @xmath315 operations .",
    "the extraordinary speedup of this algorithm makes is possible to go up to sample sizes of @xmath286 for 1000step rws in 7 dimensions .",

    "<S> motivated by an investigation of ground state properties of randomly charged polymers , we discuss the size distribution of the largest @xmath0segments ( segments with total charge @xmath0 ) in such @xmath1mers . upon mapping the charge sequence to one  dimensional random walks ( rws ) , this corresponds to finding the probability for the largest segment with total displacement @xmath0 in an @xmath1step rw to have length @xmath2 . using analytical , exact enumeration , and monte carlo methods , </S>",
    "<S> we reveal the complex structure of the probability distribution in the large @xmath1 limit . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the size of the longest neutral segment has a distribution with a square - root singularity at @xmath3 , an essential singularity at @xmath4 , and a discontinuous derivative at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior near @xmath6 is related to a another interesting rw problem which we call the  staircase problem \" . </S>",
