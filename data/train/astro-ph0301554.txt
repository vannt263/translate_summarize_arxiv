    "in spite of near continuous study at many wavelengths since its discovery @xcite , the nature of the cygnus x-3 binary system remains mysterious .",
    "several important questions remain about the nature of the compact object and its companion and about the specific location of the source of observed x - ray and infrared emission .",
    "existing models describe the system either as a high - mass system consisting of a black hole and a wolf - rayet star @xcite or as a low - mass system consisting of a neutron star and a degenerate companion @xcite . both of these models account for the intense x - ray emission , the existence of a helium - rich stellar wind , and the resulting large mass loss from the system .",
    "the observation of a 12.6  ms pulsar signal in gamma ray data @xcite is evidence that the compact object is a neutron star .",
    "however , though this pulsar signal has been repeatedly observed by the group that first reported it @xcite , it has not been confirmed by independent investigators and it has never been observed at lower energies .",
    "non - observation at lower energies is not incompatible with observation at higher energies since the scattering distance for x - rays in the dense wind is much shorter than for gamma rays .",
    "if true , the pulsar detection is proof that the compact object is a neutron star .",
    "absent independent confirmation , however , the reports of a pulsar signal must be regarded with skepticism .",
    "one key to understanding the nature of the two stars in the system would be a direct measurement of their masses . by measuring the doppler shift of the infrared emission , @xcite report that they have measured the velocity of the infrared companion and constrained the compact object to be , at the least , a very massive neutron star .",
    "hanson , still , & fender ( 2000 ) use the doppler shift of a different infrared feature to make a more correct measurement of the velocity of the companion which prefers lower mass systems except that it also implies that the companion must be the dominant mass in the system .",
    "this rules out systems consisting of a neutron star with a white dwarf companion . knowing the velocity of only one of the stars of a binary system does not constrain the total mass of the system . to determine the masses of both stars ,",
    "we must make a measurement of the velocity of the compact object .",
    "we used data collected by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( _ cxo _ ) during the radio quiet period prior to the april 2000 radio outburst @xcite .",
    "data were taken on two occasions two days apart and each observation lasted approximately five hours , completely covering one orbital period of the source .",
    "the observations were carried out using the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) . due to photon pileup in the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer caused by the brightness of cygnus x-3 ,",
    "the automatic processing was unable to pinpoint the center of the zeroth order maximum of the grating spectra .",
    "we refined the automatically determined source location by fitting prominent spectral features in both the positive and negative first order spectra of the medium energy grating ( meg ) and the high energy grating ( heg ) .",
    "the source location was adjusted so that the fitted wavelengths for all four first order spectra were identical . by this method , the location of the x - ray source was determined to be 2032258@xmath101 @xmath24057280@xmath101 which , given the 06 absolute astrometric accuracy of the _ cxo _ , is consistent with the radio location given by @xcite .",
    "we divided the data into eight bins by the orbital phase of the source according to the ephemeris in table [ ephemtable ] . in each of these phase bins ,",
    "we fit a continuum model and gaussian line profiles to data from both positive and negative first - order spectra from the heg and the meg simultaneously .",
    "the continuum was fit by a power law spectrum with a model of interstellar absorption .",
    "though the distance to cygnus x-3 is still poorly determined , the degree of the absorption fit by the spectrum , @xmath3  /@xmath4 is consistent with other measurements of the distance to cygnus x-3 or of the intervening absorption column @xcite .",
    "our measured value is also independent of orbital phase .",
    "r@l @xmath5&jd @xmath6 + @xmath7&@xmath8 d + @xmath9&@xmath10    we fit a gaussian line function to the three most prominent lines visible in the spectrum , the lyman @xmath11 lines of and and the helium @xmath11 line of .",
    "only these three lines were strong enough in the phase - dependent spectra that they could be fit reliably for all phase intervals .",
    "examples of these fits are shown in figure [ samplines ] .",
    "the and lines showed a consistent average doppler shift corresponding to a recession velocity of @xmath12 km / s .",
    "this is somewhat less than the velocity of 750800  km / s reported by @xcite , also from hetgs data , but nearly consistent given the absolute spectral accuracy of the hetgs is on the order of 100  km / s .",
    "figure [ shift](a ) shows the doppler shift of the 6.18    lyman @xmath11 line of and figure [ shift](b ) shows the doppler shift of the 4.73    lyman @xmath11 line of .",
    "the parameters of the best fit of a cosine function to the doppler shift of each line are given in table [ dopfit ] .",
    "the sinusoidal function provides a better fit to the data than does a constant function .",
    "for , @xmath13 per degree of freedom drops from 2.7 to 1.6 with the change from a constant function to a sinusoidal function . in the change in @xmath13 per degree of freedom is from 2.8 to 1.5 .",
    "the f - test probabilities for these detections are 18% and 14% , respectively , so the chance probability of the simultaneous detection of these two modulations is 2.5% .",
    "the doppler shift of the line has significant day - to - day variation though the modulation is clearly present on both days .",
    "the modulation of the line appears to be particularly repeatable .",
    "sinusoidal functions may not be the most appropriate functional forms to fit to these data . in the simplest configuration",
    ", the emission region will be in the form of a ring or a disk near the compact object sampling different wind velocities .",
    "in addition , different parts of the emission region may be occulted at different times . beyond the apparent inadequacy of the shape of the fit function",
    ", the phase of the maximum doppler shift may be affected by the differential occultation of the emission region .",
    "nevertheless , the amplitude of the fit sinusoid gives a reasonable approximation of the amplitude of the correct functional form .",
    "the quality of these fits to the data ( @xmath13 per degree of freedom is 1.6 for and 1.5 for ) indicate that within our uncertainties the true functional form is not much more complicated than a sinusoid .",
    "lclcllr & @xmath14&@xmath15&@xmath16&@xmath17&@xmath18&@xmath19 + & @xmath20&@xmath21&@xmath22&@xmath23&@xmath24&@xmath25 + & @xmath26&@xmath27&@xmath28&@xmath29&@xmath30 &    figure [ shift](c ) shows the doppler shift of the 1.86   he  @xmath11 line .",
    "the data are consistent with a constant doppler shift .",
    "the @xmath13 per degree of freedom assuming a constant doppler shift is 1.77 while the best fit sinusoidal function yields a @xmath13 per degree of freedom of 1.84 .",
    "the non - observation of a modulation of the doppler shift in allows us to set an upper limit on the velocity of the emission region for this line .",
    "the 90% confidence upper limit derived for a fit to these data is 220  km / s .",
    "in order to use our observations to draw conclusions about the size and mass of the cygnus x-3 system , we must first decide where in the system the emission is produced .",
    "@xcite observed that line emission from hydrogen - like helium was produced in that part of the stellar wind of the companion which is shaded by the companion from the x - rays emanating from the compact object . according to his model , the rest of the wind is too highly ionized to produce helium line emission .",
    "the coincidence between the maximum red shift of the line emission from hydrogen - like silicon and sulfur and the time of the x - ray minimum ( taken to indicate the superior conjunction of the compact object ) suggests that these emission features are produced in the companion wind near the compact object . the fact that the silicon and sulfur emission are produced much nearer to the x - ray source than the hydrogen emission suggests that the dominant source of ionization in the cygnus x-3 system is the x - rays . the level of ionization appears to increase with proximity to the source of x - rays .",
    "emission from hydrogen - like and helium - like iron will thus be produced even closer to the x - ray source  presumably the compact object  than is the silicon or sulfur emission .",
    "we will , therefore , assume that the emission feature produced by helium - like iron is produced close to the compact object .",
    "the emission features of highly ionized iron may be produced in a region of the wind captured by the compact object or from an accretion disk around the object if not from the surface of the object itself . without knowing the phase relationship between the doppler shift of the line and the x - ray ephemeris",
    ", we can not be sure that it would reveal the motion of the compact object . if , however , we assume that this is so we can use our non - observation of doppler shift in the line to constrain the velocity of the compact object . the equation for the mass function @xmath31 yields an upper limit on the mass function of 0.22  @xmath32 taking @xmath33  h and our 90% confidence upper limit of 220  km / s for the maximum radial velocity , @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite show that a high mass - loss rate can drive the system into an eccentric orbit as well as cause it to circularize .",
    "for simplicity we will assume @xmath35 for the time being .",
    "by measuring the doppler shift of the centroid of an infrared absorption feature in the stellar wind @xcite calculated a mass function for the wind producing companion of 0.027  @xmath36 .",
    "we can combine this mass function with our mass function upper limit by simultaneously solving the following equations @xmath37 where the subscript c refers to the compact object and the subscript d refers to the mass donating companion .",
    "@xmath38 is the inclination of the binary orbit .",
    "the upper limits on the masses of the two stars derived this way are @xmath39 and @xmath40 for an inclination , @xmath41 .",
    "these limits essentially exclude all stars that could produce the observed x - ray flux .",
    "mass upper limits as a function of orbital inclinations are shown in figure [ orbit](a ) .",
    "the orbital model of cygnus x-3 that has been used most extensively is one of two stellar wind models proposed by @xcite which have a large orbital inclination and a large eccentricity .",
    "even @xcite state that the inclination should be large , but our results , taken in combination with theirs , make large inclinations unphysical . in light of other recent work",
    "@xcite it appears that the lack of apsidal motion in the system requires that the orbital eccentricity be small .",
    "in addition , several authors @xcite demonstrate that the orbital inclination of the system must also be small .",
    "the best fit to the @xcite model based on a variable luminosity x - ray source inside its companion s stellar wind satisfies the need for both a small orbital inclination ( @xmath42 ) and eccentricity ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "using these values in equations [ massfunc ] & [ masses ] gives an upper limit for the mass of the compact object , @xmath44 and for the companion of @xmath45 .",
    "these mass limits do nt preclude the possibility of the system being composed of a black hole and a wolf - rayet star .",
    "neither do they rule out the compact object being a neutron star but the suggestion that its companion is more massive than the compact object rules out the possibility that the companion is also degenerate ( a white dwarf ) .",
    "table [ dopfit ] shows that the maximum red shift of the and emission lines are nearly coincident with the minimum of the continuum x - ray intensity .",
    "the coincidence of the maximum radial velocity of the line emission and the x - ray minimum means that the line emitting region is moving most directly away from earth at the same time that the compact object is at its furthest distance from earth .",
    "this , then , suggests that the line emission emanates from a region of the companion s stellar wind blowing by the compact object and close to it .",
    "we can therefore use our measured velocity for this wind with a model of wind acceleration to constrain the size of the binary system .",
    "the standard model of stellar wind acceleration appropriate to wolf - rayet stars is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the core radius of the star and @xmath48 expresses the degree of acceleration .",
    "alternately , the wind velocity can be expressed in terms of the extent of the accelerating wind , @xmath49 @xcite where @xmath50 is the distance from the wind producing star to where the terminal velocity is reached .",
    "we can combine the wind velocities implied by the analysis of the and lines to provide an estimate of the wind velocity in the emission region surrounding the compact object of @xmath51  km / s .",
    "taking @xmath52  km / s @xcite , @xmath53 @xcite , and @xmath54 @xcite , the distance between the emitting region and the wind producing companion star is @xmath55 .",
    "this result assumes an inclination @xmath41 . for an inclination angle @xmath56",
    ", we calculate @xmath57 for the distance between the donor star and the emission region .",
    "since this emission comes from near the x - ray star , the distance calculated between the emission region and the companion star is the distance between the two stars .",
    "the size of the roche lobe of each star can be calculated directly from the mass functions .",
    "the radius of the roche lobes is given by @xmath58 @xcite where @xmath59 is the binary separation and @xmath60 is the ratio of the stellar masses , which is only dependent on the mass functions and which in the case of the results presented here @xmath61 .",
    "this yields a roche lobe radius of the companion star of @xmath62 at an inclination , @xmath56 , which is somewhat small for a wolf - rayet star @xcite especially given that the dominant mass - transfer process is the stellar wind rather than roche lobe overflow . the companion roche lobe radius is plotted as a function of the inclination of the system in figure [ orbit](b ) .",
    "we have determined an upper limit on the radial motion of the x - ray emitting star .",
    "this limit assumes that the doppler shift of the emission feature produced by would reveal the motion of the x - ray emitting star .",
    "the relative phases of the observed doppler shift of the , , and emission features suggest that the degree of ionization of the circumstellar material is correlated with proximity to the x - ray source .",
    "this is consistent with our assumption .",
    "combined with several other observations , we begin to paint a consistent picture of the cygnus x-3 system . the picture favored by our analysis is of a system consisting of two relatively low mass stars , a compact object @xmath63 and its companion @xmath64 which orbit each other separated by @xmath57 in relatively circular @xmath65 orbit that has a small inclination @xmath56 relative to our line of site .",
    "future x - ray observations will enable us to test the assumptions underlying this picture and , if they prove correct , to determine the orbital parameters of the system .",
