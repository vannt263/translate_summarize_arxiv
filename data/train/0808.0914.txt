    "with its @xmath1 01 resolution , the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ has provided the exceptional ability to spatially resolve gas kinematics within the gravitational sphere of influence of the putative central black hole in nearby galaxies .",
    "resolving the gas kinematics very close to the black hole allows for the determination of black hole mass in a relatively straightforward manner , provided that the gas is in keplerian rotation in a thin , disk - like structure .",
    "stis has thus had a major impact on the field of supermassive black hole detection in galactic nuclei , and data from stis have contributed greatly toward establishing the correlations between black hole mass and host - galaxy properties , such as those with the stellar velocity dispersion @xcite and bulge luminosity @xcite .",
    "more recently , ground - based integral field unit ( ifu ) observations have provided two - dimensional ( 2d ) kinematic information on the ionized gas in galaxy centers @xcite .",
    "additionally , ground - based ifu observations with the assistance of adaptive optics have produced gas dynamical black hole mass measurements @xcite . without the use of adaptive optics , however , ground - based observations are usually unable to resolve scales comparable to the black hole radius of influence in nearby galaxies .",
    "although stis is a long - slit instrument , 2d information similar to ifu data can be obtained with stis by using multiple slit positions .    even with the past decade of high - resolution observations ,",
    "only about 30 dynamical black hole mass measurements have been made @xcite .",
    "consequently , searching for regular gas velocity fields dominated by gravitational motion is essential for extending the number of black hole mass measurements and further establishing the connections between black holes and host galaxies .",
    "while searching for regular gas velocity fields is clearly important , it appears , however , that they are fairly rare . instead , complicated and chaotic emission - line velocity fields are more commonly found near the centers of galaxies @xcite .",
    "although only upper limits on the black hole mass can be estimated using gas dynamical modeling in these situations @xcite , subarcsecond - resolution observations can still be useful for studying the dynamical state of the gas and searching for radial motions that might be related to active galactic nucleus ( agn ) fueling or outflows .",
    "modeling agn outflows on subarcsecond scales @xcite is important for furthering our understanding of the connection between agn feedback and host - galaxy properties .",
    "of particular interest are the connection to star formation , the growth of the supermassive black hole , and how gas may be driven out from the host galaxy as predicted in some feedback scenarios @xcite .",
    "moreover , the narrow - line region ( nlr ) velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ) , often measured from the width of the [ ] @xmath6 line , may provide a reasonable estimate of the host - galaxy stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath7 ) , albeit with substantial scatter @xcite .",
    "detailed nlr studies are essential in understanding the origin of the scatter in the @xmath5@xmath7 relationship",
    ". this relationship can be useful for distant and luminous agns where measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion is not feasible @xcite .",
    "using the narrow emission - line widths as a proxy for stellar velocity dispersion is only meaningful if the nlr gas is dominated by virial motion in the host - galaxy bulge and not by the gravitational influence of the black hole or nongravitational motions .",
    "therefore , outflows and similar nongravitational motions , which can disrupt viral motion , are one potential cause of the scatter in the @xmath5@xmath7 relationship .    while nongravitational motions are clearly important in setting the narrow - line widths in agns with strong outflows , there can be an important contribution to the line widths from nongravitational motion even in objects that are not outflow - dominated . from",
    "stis observations , @xcite found that circumnuclear gas in fanaroff - riley 1 radio galaxies typically has an intrinsic velocity dispersion in excess of that expected from purely gravitational motion in the host - galaxy potential .",
    "they concluded that this excess line width is driven by the injection of energy by the agn , although there was no obvious relationship between the agn radiative luminosity and the magnitude of the nongravitational line dispersion .",
    "other origins for the scatter were studied by @xcite using a large sample of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) type 2 agns .",
    "they looked for correlations of nuclear properties ( radio power , agn luminosity , eddington ratio ) , as well as global properties ( host - galaxy morphology , local environment , star - formation rate ) , with the excess line width , defined to be the difference between the dispersion of the [ ] @xmath6 line and the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "they found a strong correlation between the excess line width and eddington ratio , where larger excess line widths , indicative of outflowing gas , were seen in the higher eddington ratio objects .",
    "another potential explanation for the scatter in the @xmath5@xmath7 relationship is the effect of observational aperture size .",
    "@xcite investigated the relationship between line width and aperture size in a sample of nearby seyferts using single - slit stis observations .",
    "they found a wide range of behavior in how the widths of the [ ] @xmath6 and [ ] @xmath86716 , 6731 lines varied as a function of radius , but the most common trends were either a roughly constant width or an increase in width with increasing aperture size .",
    "their analysis showed that the line widths measured within the largest stis aperture were systematically smaller by 10%20% than both the stellar velocity dispersion and the line widths measured within a ground - based sized aperture .",
    "they concluded that the smaller line width measured within the randomly oriented stis slit is the result of sampling a smaller portion of the velocity field than the larger ground - based aperture .    beyond the @xmath5@xmath7 relationship",
    ", we can address other open questions concerning low - luminosity agns .",
    "@xcite pointed out that while the nlr in luminous agns occurs on scales of tens of parsecs , where its dynamics are dominated by the bulge , the nlr in low - luminosity agns is more compact , and its dynamics could be dominated by the black hole .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether the narrow - line widths in low - luminosity agns are set by the black hole or by the bulge potential .",
    "the nlr emission lines also provide information on ionization mechanisms .",
    "spectra of low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be reproduced with photoionization models involving a nonstellar continuum and low ionization parameters @xcite , but high electron densities , as well as a large range of densities , are needed in order to reproduce the strength of the [ ] @xmath9 line @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that such conditions exist in the liner ngc 7213 , and that there is a correlation between line width and the critical density for collisional deexcitation .",
    "a similar relationship between line width and ionization potential was also previously seen in seyferts @xcite .",
    "this implied that the nlr is not a homogeneous environment , but must have radial gradients in velocity and density . in ground - based spectra",
    "these spatial gradients were generally unresolved , but using stis it is possible to directly resolve the density gradients in the inner nlr @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to determine what fraction of liners show spatially resolved density gradients , and whether the type 2 liners , where a central photoionizing source is not always seen , exhibit density gradients .    in this paper",
    ", we present multislit _",
    "hst _ stis observations of 14 low - luminosity agns , including 13 liners and 1 seyfert .",
    "we use the high spatial resolution of stis to map out the 2d kinematic structure of the nlr within the inner @xmath10 pc , and search for velocity fields that show signs of regular rotation for which gas dynamical modeling may be performed .",
    "the subarcsecond resolution stis data also allow us to detect electron - density gradients through the [ ] @xmath11 line ratio diagnostic .",
    "finally , we examine how the [ ] line width varies as a function of aperture size over spatial scales ranging from those comparable to the black hole sphere of influence to scales dominated by the bulge .",
    "our goal is to examine the nlr of low - luminosity agns through stis spectra of the h@xmath0 spectral region at multiple slit positions .",
    "eight galaxies observed under program go-7354 ( pi dressel ) fit this description , and we retrieved those from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "we combined these eight galaxies with six galaxies that were observed as part of our own program , go-7403 , to arrive at a sample of 14 galaxies .",
    "program go-7354 was originally designed to study liner nuclei with compact , flat - spectrum radio cores , while the observations under program go-7403 focused on obtaining black hole masses in a sample of low - luminosity broad - lined agns .",
    "all of the galaxies are optically classified as liners except ngc 3227 , which contains a seyfert 1 nucleus , and ngc 3245 , which is a transition object .",
    "properties of all 14 galaxies in the sample are given in table [ tab : galprop ] and details of the observations are presented in table [ tab : obsparams ] .",
    "with the exception of ngc 3998 , ngc 4594 , and ngc 6500 , all of the galaxies from program go-7354 were observed with the stis ` 52x0.1 ` aperture with no gap between the three adjacent slit positions .",
    "ngc 3998 , ngc 4594 , and ngc 6500 were observed with the same ` 52x0.1 ` aperture , but consist of five slit positions , again with no gap between neighboring slit positions .",
    "the ccd was read out with binning by two along the dispersion axis , creating a scale of @xmath12@xmath13 pixel@xmath14 along the spatial axis and @xmath15 pixel@xmath14 along the dispersion axis .",
    "the slit position angle was constrained to be within 15@xmath16 of the major axis of the gaseous disk . the g750 m grating provided coverage of 64907050  , which included the [ ] @xmath86548 , 6583 , h@xmath0 , and [ ] @xmath86716 , 6731 lines . for this program ,",
    "a typical exposure time per position was @xmath17 s.    observations of the six galaxies under program go-7403 were obtained with the stis ` 52x0.2 ` and a spacing of @xmath12@xmath18 between adjacent slits ( i.e. , a gap of @xmath12@xmath19 between slits ) .",
    "two of these galaxies , ngc 1052 and ngc 3227 , were observed with seven parallel slit positions , while ngc 3245 , ngc 4036 , ngc 4278 , and ngc 4579 were observed with five slit positions . for these galaxies ,",
    "the ccd was read out in unbinned mode , and the slit position angle was left unconstrained . with this setting the 2d spectral image has a scale of @xmath12@xmath13 pixel@xmath14 along the slit and @xmath20 pixel@xmath14 along the dispersion direction .",
    "the g750 m grating was used to cover 63006860   , which included the h@xmath21 [ ] , [ ] @xmath86716 , 6731 , and [ ] @xmath86300 , 6364 emission lines .",
    "a typical exposure time per position was @xmath22 s. the combination of longer exposure times and the use of a wider slit made it possible to map out the nlr to larger radii and at higher signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) than for program go-7354 .",
    "the data for all 14 galaxies were reduced using the standard stsci pipeline .",
    "dark and bias subtraction , as well as flat - field corrections , were performed , along with the rejection of cosmic - ray events through the combination of multiple subexposures .",
    "the data were wavelength and flux calibrated and rectified for geometric distortions .",
    "occasionally a number of hot pixels remained even after the data were run through the pipeline . in those cases",
    ", we performed an additional cleaning step by replacing the bad pixel with a local mean value in the flattened data , and then applied the geometric distortion correction to the cleaned images .",
    "in addition to the stis observations , we obtained wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images from the archives in order to examine the nuclear morphology .",
    "when available , we retrieved the images from the wfpc2 associations web site .",
    "otherwise , they were retrieved from the _ hst _ archive . in order to remove cosmic rays ,",
    "`` cr - split '' observations were combined using the iraf combine task .",
    "if only single exposures were available , they were cleaned using the la - cosmic task @xcite .",
    "black hole mass measurements have been previously made for three of the galaxies in the sample : ngc 3245 @xcite , ngc 3998 @xcite , and ngc 5077 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite presented velocity curves for ngc 6500 and ic 989 ; however , both velocity fields were too complex to model the gas as a thin circularly rotating disk , so no black hole masses were determined for these two galaxies .",
    "spectra were extracted from individual rows of the geometrically rectified 2d images , and the rows were extracted as far out as emission lines were detectable . for the eight galaxies from program go-7354 ,",
    "the emission lines were typically detectable out to about @xmath12@xmath23 from the slit center , and for the six galaxies from program go-7403 , emission lines were measured out to about @xmath24@xmath23 . before any fitting was performed , the continuum was removed from the spectrum on a row - by - row basis by fitting a straight line to the continuum regions covering @xmath25@xmath26  , @xmath27@xmath28  , and @xmath29@xmath30  .",
    "this continuum fit was then subtracted from the spectrum . in general , a straight line is not a very good continuum model near h@xmath0 , but given the low s / n in the continuum at most positions , the small wavelength range , and the agn dominance in the nuclei of some objects , a proper starlight subtraction could not be performed . during the emission - line fitting process , multiple rows that contained weak emission lines far from the slit center were binned together to improve the s / n .",
    "in order to obtain the emission - line velocity , velocity dispersion , and flux , we fit each spectrum with a set of gaussians , where the fit was carried out row - by - row with a levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization technique using c. markwardt s `` mpfit '' library in idlcraigm / idl / idl.html . ] .",
    "single gaussians were simultaneously fit to all the emission lines present in the spectra that were strong enough to be fit accurately .",
    "the fluxes of the [ ] @xmath86548 , 6583 lines were held at a 3:1 ratio , and all lines were required to have a common velocity . the [ ]",
    "lines were constrained to have equal velocity widths .",
    "the widths of the [ ] lines were also required to be the same , which was necessary due to the lower s / n in the off - nuclear rows .",
    "although the widths of the two [ ] lines can differ , the effect is small @xcite . if present , the [ ] line widths were constrained to be equal .    whenever this basic model did not return adequate fits due to either low s / n or to severe blending between the [ ] and h@xmath0 lines , we applied further constraints , such as tying together the h@xmath0 and [ ] widths , or linking the h@xmath0 , [ ] , and [ ] widths . additionally , some spectra appeared to contain two kinematically separate components at some locations . in these instances",
    ", we fit two gaussians to each of the h@xmath0 , [ ] @xmath86548 , 6583 , [ ] @xmath86716 , 6731 , and the [ ] @xmath31 lines .",
    "we fit a single gaussian to the [ ] @xmath32 line , and sometimes to the [ ] @xmath31 line , in place of two gaussians since often these lines were too weak to constrain a multiple - component model .",
    "each set of gaussians in the multiple - velocity component model was constrained in the manner previously described above for the basic model .    near the nuclear regions",
    ", several galaxies in the sample exhibited a broad h@xmath0 component in addition to the narrow lines of h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath86548 , 6583 .",
    "for these regions , an additional component in the form of either a single or a double gaussian was added to the fit .",
    "if the broad component could not be adequately fit by two gaussians , we selected points along the broad base of the h@xmath0 line and fit a cubic spline to trace the shape of the broad component .",
    "this was then subtracted from the spectrum , leaving just the narrow emission lines .",
    "a cubic - spline model was needed for several rows while fitting the broad component in ngc 3227 , ngc 4278 , and ngc 4579 .",
    "we judged the effectiveness of an additional h@xmath0 broad component both by eye and by comparing the reduced @xmath33 , where if the reduced @xmath33 was improved by @xmath34 or more , we accepted the broad - component fit .",
    "figure [ fig : fitex ] shows examples of fits with single or double narrow - line components and with a broad h@xmath0 component .    from the model fits , we obtained the velocity , velocity dispersion , and flux for the [ ] @xmath4 emission line . in calculating the velocity dispersion , we accounted for the instrumental line width by using observations of the stis wavelength calibration lamp .",
    "gaussian models were fit to the emission - line profiles of extracted calibration - lamp spectra .",
    "the variation in line width as a function of wavelength was insignificant across the spectrum and as a result , we used the average value from measurements of several lines .",
    "the instrumental velocity dispersion was @xmath35 km s@xmath14 for program go-7403 and @xmath36 km s@xmath14 for program go-7354 .",
    "these instrumental line widths were then subtracted in quadrature from the observed line widths .",
    "the velocity , velocity dispersion , and flux measured from the [ ] @xmath4 emission line for 12 of the 14 galaxies is plotted as a function of the position along a single slit in figures [ fig : ngc1052][fig : ic989 ] .",
    "we show the galaxy s systemic velocity , taken from optical line measurements in the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 ) @xcite , as the dashed line in the radial - velocity plots . for each galaxy , we also calculated the flux - weighted average velocity measured from the largest square aperture possible given the number of stis slits for the galaxy and the number of rows from which spectra could be extracted . for five galaxies in the sample ,",
    "the flux - weighted mean velocity differs from the rc3 velocity by @xmath37 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we define the galaxy center ( @xmath38-offset = 0 ) to be the row with the largest continuum flux .",
    "the peak of the continuum flux coincided with the peak of the h@xmath0 broad - component flux in five of the seven broad - line galaxies , and in the cases of ngc 4579 and ngc 3998 , the peak broad - component flux was offset from the peak of the continuum by one ccd row , corresponding to 4 and 8 pc , respectively .",
    "one possible explanation for the small offset is differential extinction between the continuum and the emission - line flux .",
    "similarly , the peak of the narrow - line emission coincided with the peak of the continuum in five of the seven narrow - line galaxies , but for ngc 4036 and ic 989 , the peak of the [ ] @xmath4 flux was offset from the continuum peak by one ccd row , corresponding to 5 and 50 pc , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath0 broad - component flux peak coincided with the narrow - line flux maximum in only two ( ngc 1052 and ngc 4278 ) of the seven type 1 agns . in the other type 1 objects , the offset between broad and narrow - flux peaks was just one ccd row .    for completeness",
    "we include the velocity fields from ngc 3245 , ngc 3998 , and ngc 5077 , although the data have been previously presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we also include the velocity fields for ngc 6500 and ic 989 since @xcite present the velocity curves from the central slit positions , while we display the velocity fields from every slit position .",
    "our measurements of the velocity fields from all five of these galaxies are consistent with those results previously published .    for all but two galaxies , a continuum - subtracted h@xmath21 [ ] image was created by subtracting a scaled wfpc2 702w image , or a scaled combination of f547 m and f791w images , from a f658n image .",
    "this is shown along with the positions of the stis slits in the second panel of the set of wfpc2 images at the top of the figures .",
    "we verified that the central slit position was placed on the nucleus by examining the peak - up image , which is an undispersed image taken through the slit , and the acquisition image , which is an initial image of the object taken with a larger aperture .",
    "we compared the spatial profile of the peak - up image to the spatial profile produced by vertical cuts through the nucleus of the acquisition image , and found similar profiles , indicating that the slit was centered on the nucleus .",
    "the 14 galaxies in the sample show a large diversity in their observed velocity fields .",
    "some velocity fields are consistent with rotation but perhaps at a low s / n , some galaxies seem to be in overall rotation with significant random components , some appear to be dominated by irregular motions , and others demonstrate clear evidence for outflows . as mentioned earlier , three galaxies ( ngc 3245 , ngc 3998 , ngc 5077 ) have velocity fields previously shown to be consistent with circularly rotating disks . while there is no foolproof way to predict which galaxies will contain regularly rotating gas , @xcite determine that the morphology of dust lanes can be a reliable indicator of organized velocities fields .",
    "they find that galaxies with smooth , circularly symmetric dust rings often have velocity fields suitable for gas dynamical modeling , while those objects with clearly disorderly dust lanes almost never contain regular velocity fields .",
    "figure [ fig : nii2sb_radial ] shows the [ ] @xmath4 surface brightness as a function of projected angular distance from the nucleus , where each point corresponds to a single row measurement . in order to emphasize the trends",
    ", we averaged together points within 01-wide annuli for the galaxies observed under program go-7403 . for ngc 3998 ,",
    "ngc 4594 , and ngc 6500 , we averaged together points that fell within 005-wide bins .",
    "these averages are plotted as black triangles .",
    "the shape of the surface brightness profile varies between galaxies , where some galaxies show a dramatic increase in surface brightness within the innermost regions and other galaxies exhibit a gradual rise in surface brightness over a larger range of radii .",
    "however , almost all of the galaxies in the sample do exhibit a centrally peaked surface brightness profile .",
    "3998 shows the sharpest peak in surface brightness , where the [ ] surface brightness falls by about a factor of 58 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 028 .",
    "conversely , ngc 4278 , ngc 3245 , and ic 989 show the flattest profiles , where the [ ] surface brightness decreases by a factor of about 34 within the inner 025 .",
    "ngc 2911 does not exhibit a central peak in the emission - line surface brightness , although the error bars are large and may mask a weak rise in surface brightness at smaller radii .",
    "in general , both type 1 and 2 liners have central peaks in emission - line surface brightness .",
    "radial - velocity maps of each galaxy are shown in figure [ fig : radvelmap ] . for galaxies having multiple velocity components",
    ", we show the radial - velocity map for the velocity component plotted in black in figures [ fig : ngc1052 ] , [ fig : ngc3227 ] , [ fig : ngc4278 ] , and [ fig : ngc4579 ] . in these multiple - slit velocity curves for ngc 1052 ,",
    "ngc 3227 , ngc 4278 , and ngc 4579 , we attempt to label what appears to be coherent kinematic systems by using black and grey colors .",
    "however , we can not definitively say that all black points represent a single component and all grey points represent a separate component .",
    "this ambiguity in the identification of coherent velocity components affects the radial - velocity maps in figure [ fig : radvelmap ] and may cause the velocity field we show to be more chaotic than it is in reality . while the multiple - slit velocity curves presented in figures [ fig : ngc1052][fig : ic989 ] contain the same information , the velocity maps show more clearly whether the gas is dominated by rotational motion or chaotic motions .",
    "below we discuss the velocity fields for each galaxy in the sample , with the exception of ngc 3245 and ngc 3998 .",
    "overall the gas does not exhibit a regular rotation curve , and the presence of strong outflows can clearly be seen in the stis data .",
    "the multiple velocity components identified in our spectra are spatially coincident with the structure seen in the narrow - band h@xmath21 [ ] emission - line image from @xcite , who detected an ionization cone at a position angle of @xmath41 .",
    "two kinematically distinct components are seen in four of the off - nucleus slit positions and correspond to the location of jet - like features seen in the wfpc2 f658n image .",
    "the velocity splittings are as large as @xmath42 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the jet - like feature emerging from the nucleus toward the east is blueshifted by @xmath43 km s@xmath14 relative to the galaxy s systemic velocity of 1474 km s@xmath14 , and the western jet is redshifted by @xmath44 km s@xmath14 . in the eastern jet , in slit position 7 ,",
    "the line widths are extremely large , with a velocity dispersion of 600 km s@xmath14 .",
    "previous ground - based spectroscopic work by @xcite has also found two components to the emission - line profiles , where one component is due to disk rotation at radii greater than @xmath45  with an axis of rotation at a position angle of 153@xmath46 .",
    "the second component is attributed to a bipolar outflow , seen at a radius of @xmath11  from the nucleus , whose axis is at a position angle of @xmath47 .",
    "the blueshifted side of the outflow has a higher velocity of at least @xmath48 km s@xmath14 relative to the systemic velocity , while the redshifted side has a velocity of @xmath49 km s@xmath14 relative to the systemic velocity @xcite . additionally , @xcite and @xcite found evidence for outflows on large scales from ground - based spectra .",
    "the fit to the spectrum from the nuclear region of the central slit was improved by the addition of a broad h@xmath0 component , as expected since this is a well - known type 1.9 liner ; the broad h@xmath0 emission has been shown to be polarized , indicating that the broad - line region is seen in reflected light @xcite .",
    "although the velocity map of ngc 1052 and the central slit velocity curve superficially resemble a rotational velocity field , the velocity structure shown in figure [ fig : radvelmap ] indicates that the nlr is actually dominated by an outflow .",
    "the color - coded velocity map shows only one of the two velocity components , where the component we plot shows redshifted and blueshifted sides that correspond to the jet - like features seen in the wfpc2 image .      due to the poor s / n of the spectra , especially from the first slit position",
    ", only a few rows in each exposure could be fit .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to determine whether the gas is rotating .",
    "however , a velocity gradient of 150 km s@xmath14 is seen across 015 in the central slit position , and this could be consistent with rotation , although the velocity gradient is not symmetric about the location of the peak of the narrow - line region flux .      only a small number of velocity measurements could be made at each slit position due to the low s /",
    "n of the spectra .",
    "however , the velocity map suggests that the gas is dominated by rotational motion .",
    "the central slit position exhibits a gradient of 270 km s@xmath14 across the innermost 03 . with higher quality spectra",
    ", this galaxy could be a good candidate for dynamical modeling .",
    "the flux - weighted average velocity measured in a 03 square aperture is 3285 km s@xmath14 , while the systemic velocity taken from rc3 is 3167 km s@xmath14 .",
    "other optical measurements of the systemic velocity given by the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) span a large range of velocities , @xmath50 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the inconsistencies between the various systemic velocity measurements may be the result of dust obscuration of the galaxy nucleus and one side of the emission - line disk , as a dust lane is visible in the wfpc2 image .",
    "the velocity field is very complex and chaotic .",
    "two separate kinematic components are seen in all seven slit positions . at some locations ,",
    "the velocity differences between the multiple velocity components are as large as @xmath51 km s@xmath14 .",
    "our kinematic mapping of ngc 3227 shows that the nlr contains components with low velocities and low velocity dispersions , as well as components with high velocities and high velocity dispersions . in particular , in the eastern direction in slit positions 1 and 2 , one of the components",
    "has a velocity of @xmath52 km s@xmath14 relative to the systemic velocity and a velocity dispersion of @xmath17 km s@xmath14 . in slit position 7 , in the northern direction , one component has a velocity of @xmath53 km s@xmath14 relative to the systemic velocity , and a velocity dispersion of @xmath17 km s@xmath14 .",
    "similar multicomponent structures have been seen in other seyferts as well , including ngc 4151 @xcite .",
    "an additional h@xmath0 broad component was fit to spectra in all but the outermost two slit positions .",
    "the brightness of the h@xmath0 broad component in the central slit position , as well as in the adjacent slit positions 2 and 3 , appears to be consistent with a bright point source that has been smeared by the stis point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "however , the flux of the broad component found at a y offset of @xmath5403 to 005 in slit position 5 , and the broad component flux at a y offset of @xmath54025 to 015 in slit position 6 , appear to be in excess of that expected from the wings of a point source .",

    "they suggest that the complicated velocity curves are the result of a nuclear expanding bubble . @xcite",
    "detected multiple velocity components out to 1 kpc away from the nucleus , indicating that the extended nlr is experiencing an outflow .",

    "thus , while the electron density can not be directly determined from the [ ] @xmath83 [ ] ratio , the rise in the line ratio seen in ngc 1052 , ngc 4278 , and ngc 4579 gives strong evidence for a steep inner rise in density .",

    "it also appears that density gradients can persist even in the presence of strong outflows such as those seen in ngc 1052 and those seen over a portion of the nlr in ngc 3227 .",
    "moreover , these five broad - lined agns exhibit similar density structure as can be seen in figure [ fig : logden_logr ] , where we show the electron density as a function of projected radial distance from the nucleus for the five agns .",

    "it is also possible , however , that this unusual trend seen in the seyfert ngc 3227 , as well as the decrease in the electron density seen in the inner region in figure [ fig : density ] , may not be real and may be due to an inadequate fit to a rather complicated nuclear spectrum . without additional seyferts in the sample , or higher luminosity agns",
    "similar to ngc 3227 , it is impossible to determine whether this is an anomalous result or a more common finding related to the properties of the agn . with the exception of the seyfert galaxy ngc 3227",

    "they found most of the galaxies exhibited a constant or increasing fwhm with increasing aperture size .",
    "our sample allows us to perform a similar analysis on low - luminosity agns .",
    "we are able to considerably improve upon the @xcite analysis by using the stis multislit observations to study the line - width variation within square apertures of increasing size , eliminating the biases introduced by studying only a relatively narrow and randomly oriented portion of the velocity field .    for the six galaxies from program go-7403 , we choose square apertures of @xmath12@xmath137 , @xmath12@xmath138 , @xmath24@xmath137 , and @xmath24@xmath138 on a side , and for the eight galaxies from program go-7354 we used square apertures @xmath12@xmath24 , @xmath12@xmath139 , and @xmath12@xmath23 on a side .",
    "the sizes of the apertures were chosen such that the width of an entire stis slit fell within the aperture .",
    "we then used the results of the spectral fitting to the narrow [ ] @xmath4 emission line and summed together the gaussian components that fell within the various aperture bins .",
    "we characterized the profile of the summed gaussians in each aperture by measuring the line width at @xmath140% of the peak height , thus defining a fwhm for the summed line profile .",

    "we estimated the radius of the sphere of influence of the supermassive black hole , given by @xmath145 , in each of the 13 galaxies for which a stellar velocity dispersion measurement could be found .",
    "we used the @xcite @xmath146@xmath147 relation to estimate the black hole mass in all of the galaxies except ngc 3227 , ngc 3245 , ngc 3998 , ngc 4594 , and ngc 5077 .",
    "for these galaxies we used black hole mass measurements from the literature ( table [ tab : galprop ] ) .",
    "the sphere of influence was then converted into an angular scale using the distances listed in table [ tab : galprop ] and plotted as the dotted vertical lines in figure [ fig : fwhm2.35_radius_stis ] .    for most of the galaxies in the sample , the [ ] velocity dispersion peaks within the black hole sphere of influence and then decreases in larger apertures , approaching the bulge stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "this implies that on scales accessible to ground - based measurements , the width of the low - ionization lines , such as [ ] , is set by the bulge and not by the black hole .",
    "the work by @xcite suggested that in low - luminosity agns , the nlr may be dominated by the black hole and not the bulge .",
    "however , the arguments put forth by @xcite involved the [ ] line , which due to the higher ionization and higher critical density , originates from a region closer to the black hole than the [ ] line . also , our finding that , for most galaxies in the sample , the velocity dispersion is largest within the black hole sphere of influence supports the idea that stis central line - width measurements trace the black hole mass , and can therefore be used to place upper limits on black hole masses in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "ngc 1052 , ngc 3227 , and ngc 3245 , however , show a different trend , where the fwhm increases with aperture size . both ngc",
    "1052 and ngc 3227 contain successively wider or roughly constant [ ] narrow lines for the increasing stis aperture sizes , but a smaller fwhm for the ground - based aperture . in the cases of ngc 1052 and ngc 3227",
    ", the strong radial motions create large velocity splitting between components , causing an increase in the fwhm .",
    "the smaller line width seen in the ground - based aperture may be the result of the outflows decelerating at larger radii , as described in the outflow cone models by @xcite .",
    "an initial expectation for the behavior of line width with aperture size for gravitationally dominated gas may be a decreasing fwhm with increasing aperture size .",
    "this is reasonable since most of the ionized gas flux comes from a region close to the black hole , where the gas is moving the fastest and thus has the largest line width due to unresolved rotation .",
    "however , the line - width variation with aperture size in ngc 3245 clearly disagrees with the above expectation , since the gas in ngc 3245 is known to be in near - perfect disk - like rotation @xcite . in order to gain a more complete understanding of line - width variation with aperture size",
    ", we constructed a toy thin - disk model for gas in circular rotation .",
    "first , we generated a model velocity field on a grid where each model pixel was 0 on a side ( i.e. , 10@xmath88 oversampled relative to the stis pixel size ) .",
    "the velocity field is set by the black hole mass , the disk inclination angle , and the stellar mass profile .",
    "we used a @xcite model to describe the stellar mass contribution .",
    "the intrinsic line - of - sight velocity profiles were assumed to be gaussian before passing through the telescope optics , and were calculated on a velocity grid with a bin size of 25.24 km s@xmath14 , in order to match the stis pixel scale .",
    "the model velocity field was then projected onto the plane of the sky , and was synthetically `` observed '' in a manner that closely matches the stis observation . this synthetic observation involved summing the intrinsic line - of - sight velocity profiles at every point in the disk and including the blurring introduced by the nonzero stis pixel size and the telescope psf .",
    "in particular , the line - of - sight velocity profiles were weighted by the emission - line surface brightness profile , modeled by the function @xmath148 .",
    "we included an intrinsic velocity dispersion , similar to those observed in other early - type galaxies @xcite , by setting the widths of the line - of - sight velocity profiles according to @xmath149 .",
    "finally , we accounted for the telescope psf by using tiny tim @xcite to generate a 02@xmath8802 subsection of the full stis psf .",
    "the psf was subsampled to match the model pixel grid and computed for a monochromatic filter passband at @xmath150  .",
    "each velocity slice of the pixel grid was convolved with the psf .",
    "these modeling steps are a simplified version of the modeling described in detail by @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "this synthetic observation involved placing a single stis slit with increasing aperture lengths at different angles measured from the gaseous disk major axis in order to mimic the @xcite analysis .",
    "we additionally placed square apertures of increasing size over the model velocity field to replicate our measurements previously discussed . in both instances",
    ", we summed the line profiles that fell within the various apertures and calculated the fwhm of the summed profile .",
    "as an example , in figure [ fig : fwhm2.35_radius_stis_model ] we show the results of the toy model using the properties of ngc 3245 and ngc 3998 as the input parameters .",
    "we selected these galaxies because in both cases the gas is known to be in circular rotation but the behavior of line width versus aperture size is quite different for the two objects .",
    "we used the black hole mass and inclination angle determined from the models of @xcite and @xcite , and we choose the @xcite bulge normalization and the scale radius such that the toy model velocity field would match the observed velocity field as closely as possible for the outermost velocity measurements .",
    "similarly , we determined the parameters of the emission - line surface brightness profile by requiring the profile to match the observed [ ] flux distribution .",
    "also , for ngc 3245 , the parameters of the function describing the widths of the line - of - sight velocity profiles were given by @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite did not include any intrinsic velocity dispersion in their model of ngc 3998 .",
    "we therefore first generated disk models using only a small constant intrinsic line width of @xmath151 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we found an overall trend that qualitatively matched the data , but the line widths overall were too small , as can be seen in figure [ fig : fwhm2.35_radius_stis_model ] , and the line profile was double peaked in each of the apertures .",
    "since a double - peaked line profile is not seen in the data , we instead included an intrinsic velocity dispersion with the parameters @xmath152 km s@xmath14 , @xmath153 km s@xmath14 , and @xmath154 pc .",
    "we chose this intrinsic velocity dispersion since it produced a central line width more consistent with the data and a single - peaked line profile in each of the apertures .",
    "such values for the intrinsic velocity dispersion are not unreasonable given previous results of disk modeling by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , we stress that we are employing a simplified version of the disk modeling ; a complete treatment , including a more appropriate emission - line surface brightness profile and a more realistic model of how the light passes through the telescope optics , would change the values of the intrinsic velocity dispersion parameters needed to reproduce the observed line widths .",
    "the top panels for both ngc 3245 and ngc 3998 in figure [ fig : fwhm2.35_radius_stis_model ] are the results from using progressively larger square apertures .",
    "since we adopted a simplified disk model , the models in figure [ fig : fwhm2.35_radius_stis_model ] do not exactly numerically match the observational data .",
    "however , with our model , we are able to reproduce the qualitative behavior of line - width variation with aperture size .",
    "the model shows that the line width increases with increasing aperture size for ngc 3245 , and the fwhm decreases with increasing aperture size for ngc 3998 .",
    "the additional plots in each column are the results of using a single stis slit , at an orientation that is aligned along the major or minor axis of the gaseous disk .",
    "clearly , the orientation of the single slit not only affects the numerical values of the line widths , but also the general behavior of the line - width variation with aperture size , as can be seen in ngc 3245 . in both cases",
    ", the disk models always produced a monotonic trend with line width , either an increasing or decreasing line width with increasing aperture size .",
    "these models demonstrate how either an increasing or decreasing line width with increasing aperture size can be seen for gravitationally dominated gas .",
    "ngc 3245 contains a massive bulge that produces large circular velocities at distances far from the nucleus .",
    "while this is also true for ngc 3998 , ngc 3245 has a flatter emission - line surface brightness profile with relatively more flux at larger radii than in ngc 3998 , as can be seen in figure [ fig : nii2sb_radial ] .",
    "additionally , the gaseous disk in ngc 3245 is highly inclined at _",
    "i _ = @xmath155 , and",
    "the disk in ngc 3998 is less inclined with _",
    "i _ = @xmath156 . the combination of the flatter surface brightness profile , the highly inclined disk , and the massive bulge of ngc 3245 results in the contribution of a significant amount of gas with large circular velocities further away from the nucleus .",
    "consequently , the line width increases with increasing aperture size .    therefore , based upon the results of the toy model and the analysis of the observational data , the overall behavior of line width with aperture size is not a unique indicator of the kinematic state of the gas .",
    "outflowing gas can give an increasing line width with aperture size , as seen in ngc 1052 and ngc 3227 , but decelerating outflows could produce a decreasing trend in line width with aperture size as discussed by @xcite .",
    "similarly , rotation can generate either a decreasing or increasing line width with increasing aperture size .",
    "thus , while the @xcite results are useful for identifying which aperture sizes yield similar stellar and gas line widths , our results show that measurements such as these are not necessarily useful as an indicator of whether the line widths are primarily virial in origin .",
    "finally , many previous studies have examined the possible role of outflows and nongravitational motions to explain the scatter in the @xmath157@xmath158 relationship . however , our modeling and data have shown that , even for galaxies whose nlr gas is in overall rotation and dominated by virial motion , the gas line widths can differ significantly from the stellar velocity dispersion , as seen in ngc 3245 and ngc 3998 .",
    "we find that the gaseous disk inclination , the surface brightness distribution , and the aperture size and shape are important factors that also most likely contribute to the scatter seen in the @xmath157@xmath158 relationship .",
    "we have used stis data to measure detailed velocity , velocity dispersion , flux , and line - intensity ratio information within @xmath159 pc from the nucleus of 14 nearby galaxies .",
    "all of the galaxies harbor low - luminosity agns , 13 of which are classified as liners and one of which is a seyfert .",
    "we see a large diversity in the velocity fields of the 14 galaxies , where simple disk rotation is not a common state . only a few galaxies have definite disk rotation , while some others have possible disk rotation but the emission - line s / n is too low to clearly determine the kinematic state of the gas .",
    "some velocity fields are dominated by irregular motions , some show an overall rotation but with large random components , and others clearly exhibit outflows .",
    "dynamical modeling of ngc 2911 and ngc 4594 to determine black hole masses may be possible and worthwhile , although chaotic and disorganized motion will limit the accuracy of mass measurements .    through the [ ] @xmath73/ [ ] @xmath67 diagnostic",
    ", we were able to detect significant electron - density gradients in four ( ngc 1052 , ngc 3998 , ngc 4278 , and ngc 4579 ) of the five liners having a sufficient s / n .",
    "moreover , the electron - density gradients in these objects share a similar shape that can be described by a power law with a slope of @xmath160 .",
    "a similar increase near the nucleus was seen in the [ ] / [ ] line ratio for the first three of these galaxies .",
    "these results demonstrate that density gradients within the inner @xmath161 pc are common in type 1 liners .",
    "this is consistent with expectations from photoionization models of liners and from ground - based detections of correlations between line width and _ _",
    "n__@xmath132 in liners .",
    "we find that the density gradients persist in ngc 1052 and over a portion of the nlr in ngc 3227 , even in the presence of strong outflows that clearly have a large impact on the nlr gas as seen through the disorganized velocity fields with multiple velocity components .",
    "we also see evidence for correlations between line width and _",
    "_ n__@xmath132 in most liners even on the 01 scales probed by stis .",
    "measurements of the stis spectra additionally provided a means to study the [ ] @xmath4 narrow - line width variation with spectrograph aperture size . for most galaxies in our sample ,",
    "the emission - line velocity dispersion peaks within the black hole sphere of influence , then decreases in larger apertures , approaching the bulge stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "this trend is consistent with , but does not uniquely imply , virial motion .",
    "the increasing line width with aperture size seen in ngc 1052 and ngc 3227 is due to the outflows that dominate the nlr kinematics . in ngc 3245",
    ", the increase is the result of the combination of the galaxy s fairly flat emission - line surface brightness profile , the galaxy s massive bulge , and the highly inclined gaseous disk .",
    "ngc 3245 demonstrates that even gas in pure disk rotation can exhibit an increasing line width as a function of aperture size .    while work by @xcite and @xcite provide evidence for a connection between the eddington ratio and kinematic disturbance in the nlr , which may reflect an underlying trend of outflow - dominated nlrs being more predominant at high agn luminosities , our sample of galaxies is too small and does not span a sufficiently wide luminosity range to arrive at such a conclusion .",
    "since such a relationship would be helpful in understanding agn feedback and the effects on host - galaxy properties , further investigation , ideally with ifu data on a much larger sample of agns spanning a wide range of luminosities , is needed .",
