    "the fundamental objective of the actuarial ruin theory is to measure the vulnerability to insolvency .",
    "typically , the surplus of an insurance company is modeled by a stochastic process , and ruin occurs at the first time it goes below a certain threshold .",
    "a most classical and important quantity of interest is the ruin probability , and the _ gerber - shiu function _ is its generalization ; it is given as an expected discounted value of the cost function that is dependent on the ruin time , the deficit at ruin , and the surplus prior to ruin .",
    "the evaluation of the gerber - shiu function involves that of the overshoot and undershoot distributions at the first down - crossing time that do not admit explicit expressions .",
    "hence its computation is in general a challenging task .    in ruin theory ,",
    "the surplus process is commonly modeled by a stochastic process with downward jumps .",
    "due to the premiums received from the insured persons , the surplus tends to increase constantly . on the other hand ,",
    "it experiences sudden downward jumps due to the insurance payments .",
    "the classical _ cramr - lundberg _ model uses a compound poisson process with downward jumps .",
    "its generalization called the _ sparre - andersen _ model modifies it by allowing the arrival of the claims to follow a general renewal process .    in the last decade , significant progress has been made in insurance mathematics and ruin theory , thanks to the development of the theory of lvy processes @xcite . in particular , many results on the cramr - lundberg model have been generalized for a general spectrally negative lvy process , or the lvy process with only downward jumps ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this generalization enables one to construct more realistic models ; one can , for example , introduce noise by including brownian motion and/or infinitesimal jumps of infinite activity / variation .",
    "using the so - called _ scale function _ , one can express concisely many quantities of interest for a general spectrally negative lvy process .",
    "the objective of this paper is to give an approximation to the gerber - shiu function using the theory of scale functions . by the compensation formula of the lvy process",
    ", the gerber - shiu function admits an expression as a ( double ) integral with respect to the resolvent measure and the lvy measure .",
    "because the resolvent can be written using the scale function , at least in theory the computation of the gerber - shiu function boils down to that of the scale function .",
    "however , a major obstacle still remains in putting these in practice because scale functions are in general known only up to their laplace transforms , and only a few cases admit explicit expressions .",
    "the most straightforward approach of computing the scale function is to apply numerical laplace inversion as in @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is not suitable for the computation of the gerber - shiu function because the numerically approximated scale functions need to be further integrated with respect to the lvy measure . in particular",
    ", the undershoot density that is essential in the computation of the gerber - shiu function tends to have a very peculiar form with a possible spike .",
    "the approximation hence requires a high precision in computing the scale function and minimal discretization errors in numerical integration .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt a _ phase - type fitting _ of @xcite by using the scale function for the class of spectrally negative phase - type lvy processes , or lvy processes with negative phase - type - distributed jumps . consider a continuous - time markov chain with some initial distribution and state space consisting of a single absorbing state and a finite number of transient states .",
    "a phase - type distribution is that of the first entry time to the absorbing state .",
    "as has been discussed in @xcite , the scale function of this process becomes the sum of ( possibly complex ) exponentials ; it can be integrated with respect to the lvy measure analytically to obtain an explicit form of the gerber - shiu function .",
    "more importantly , the class of phase - type distributions is dense in the class of all positive - valued distributions .",
    "consequently , the gerber - shiu function of any given spectrally negative lvy process can be approximated _ in a closed form _ by that of an approximating spectrally negative phase - type lvy process .",
    "our aim is to evaluate numerically the practicability of this approach .    in our numerical results , we focus on the case where the lvy measure is finite and has a completely monotone density . in this case",
    ", the jump size distribution can be approximated by a special class of phase - type distributions , called the _ hyperexponential _ distributions . while fitting a phase - type distribution for a general distribution",
    "is often difficult , fitting a hyperexponential distribution for the ones with completely monotone densities can be efficiently done , for example by the algorithm by @xcite that is guaranteed to converge to the desired distribution .",
    "the class of lvy processes with completely monotone lvy densities includes , for example , a subset of compound poisson processes , variance gamma @xcite , cgmy @xcite , generalized hyperbolic @xcite and normal inverse gaussian @xcite processes .    in order to evaluate our approach ,",
    "we obtain , for the hyperexponential case , the closed - form expressions of the ( discounted ) overshoot / undershoot distributions at the first down - crossing time , and use it to approximate those for the processes with weibull / pareto - type jumps .",
    "the obtained results are then compared with those obtained by monte carlo simulation .    to our best knowledge , this is the first paper on the numerical evaluation of the gerber - shiu function via phase - type fitting . as the gerber - shiu measure is sensitive to approximation errors , it is important to evaluate its numerical performance .",
    "recently , the resolvents of related extensions of the lvy process have been developed , and it is reasonable to conjecture that the gerber - shiu function of these can be approximated precisely in the same way .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section_model ] reviews the spectrally negative lvy process , the gerber - shiu function , and the scale function .",
    "section [ scale_phase ] gives a summary of @xcite on the spectrally negative phase - type lvy process and its scale function .",
    "section [ section_numerical_results ] computes the gerber - shiu measure of the hyperexponential lvy process as an approximation for the case the jump size distribution admits a completely monotone density .",
    "we evaluate the performance using numerical results in section [ section_numerics ] .",
    "section [ section_concluding_remarks ] concludes with remarks on the cases of other variants of spectrally negative lvy processes .",
    "let @xmath0 be a probability space hosting a _ spectrally negative _ lvy process @xmath1 that models the surplus of a company .",
    "let @xmath2 be the conditional probability under which @xmath3 ( and also @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 the filtration generated by @xmath6 .",
    "the process @xmath6 is uniquely characterized by its _ laplace exponent _",
    "@xmath7 =   c s + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 s^2 + \\int_{(-\\infty,0 ) } ( e^{s z}-1 - s z 1_{\\{z > -1\\ } } ) \\pi ( { { \\rm d}}z ) , \\quad s \\geq 0 , \\label{laplace_spectrally_negative}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the diffusion ( brownian motion ) coefficient and @xmath9 is a lvy measure with the support @xmath10 that satisfies the integrability condition @xmath11 .",
    "it has paths of bounded variation if and only if @xmath12 see , for example , lemma 2.12 of @xcite . in this case , we can rewrite the laplace exponent ( [ laplace_spectrally_negative ] ) by @xmath13 with @xmath14 we disregard the case when @xmath6 is the negative of a subordinator ( or decreasing a.s . ) .",
    "define the ruin time as the first time the surplus goes below zero : @xmath15 here and throughout the paper , we use the convention that @xmath16 . on the event @xmath17 , the random variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 model , respectively , the deficit at ruin and surplus immediately before ruin .",
    "fix @xmath20 \\times [ 0 , \\infty ) \\rightarrow [ 0,\\infty)$ ] bounded and measurable .",
    "we define the _ gerber - shiu function _",
    "@xmath21.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the _ gerber - shiu measure _ @xmath22 , \\quad x , z > 0 , \\ ; y < 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can write @xmath23 see pages 4 and 5 of @xcite .    using the compensation formula ( see theorem 4.4 of @xcite )",
    ", this can be written in terms of the @xmath24-_resolvent measure _ of @xmath6 killed on exiting @xmath25 : @xmath26 which is known to admit a density @xmath27 for the case of spectrally negative lvy processes such that @xmath28 see below for the form of @xmath29 . as in section 1.3 of @xcite",
    ", we can write @xmath30 hence the computation of the gerber - shiu measure boils down to that of the resolvent measure .      in order to compute the resolvent measure",
    ", we shall introduce the scale function .",
    "fix @xmath31 .",
    "the scale function @xmath32 of @xmath6 is a function whose laplace transform is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 on the negative half line , it is assumed that @xmath35 .    regarding the smoothness of the scale function , if the lvy measure has no atoms or @xmath6 is of unbounded variation , then @xmath36 ; if it has a gaussian component ( @xmath37 ) , then @xmath38 .",
    "see @xcite for other known results on the smoothness .",
    "the behavior in the neighborhood of zero is given as follows .",
    "as in lemmas 4.3 and 4.4 of @xcite , for every @xmath31 , @xmath39 we plot in figure [ fig : weibull_scale ] sample plots of the scale function and its derivative for the bounded variation case with @xmath40 and the unbounded variation case with @xmath37 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we studied and evaluated the performance of the phase - type fitting approach ( motivated by @xcite ) for computing the gerber - shiu function for the spectrally negative lvy process .",
    "the method is overall accurate and is powerful in that it can obtain an approximation in a closed form .",
    "while this paper focused on the case of a spectrally negative lvy process , the proposed method can easily be generalized . by the compensation formula",
    ", the decomposition holds for a more general class of stochastic processes .",
    "therefore , by simply replacing the resolvent measure @xmath29 , the gerber - shiu function can be computed in the same way .    thanks to the recent developments of the fluctuation theories , the resolvents of various extensions of the spectrally negative lvy process are now available in terms of the scale function . here",
    ", we list several known examples of the resolvent .    1 .   the fluctuation theories of _ reflected spectrally negative lvy processes _ are well - developed . in the optimal dividend problem , where one wants to maximize the expected net present value of dividends until ruin , it is in many cases shown to be optimal to reflect the surplus process at a suitable boundary .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate the gerber - shiu function of the reflected process to evaluate the risk of an dividend paying company .",
    "as given in @xcite , the resolvent requires the derivative or the integral of the scale function , depending on whether the reflection barrier is upper or lower . for the doubly reflected case with both upper and lower barriers , see @xcite .",
    "2 .   as a variant of the reflected process , the _ refracted spectrally negative lvy process _ of @xcite",
    "changes its drift by @xmath41 whenever it is above a threshold @xmath42  it is the unique strong solution @xmath43 to the stochastic differential equation @xmath44 in insurance , this can be used to model the surplus of a dividend paying company when the dividend rate must be bounded from above by @xmath45 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the resolvent is given in @xcite .",
    "the resolvents for the cases with additional classical reflection have recently been obtained by @xcite .",
    "3 .   given two levels @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the classical @xmath48-policy controls the process by pushing the process to @xmath47 immediately when it goes above or below @xmath46 . it is , under a suitable condition , an optimal strategy in the optimal dividend problem in the presence of a fixed cost ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the resolvent is obtained in @xcite . for its two - sided cases with four - parameter @xmath49 policy ,",
    "see @xcite .    in these examples ,",
    "the resolvent @xmath29 is written in terms of the scale function , and hence as in the cases considered in this paper , those for the phase - type case can be written as ( a linear combination of ) exponential forms .",
    "consequently , the gerber - shiu function can be analytically computed in the same way . in view of the results obtained in this paper ,",
    "the phase - type error is minimal and the same procedure is expected to give an accurate approximation of the gerber - shiu function .",
