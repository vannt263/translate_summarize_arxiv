    "currently , many modern unified theories provide strong motivation for experimental searches for variation in physical constants .",
    "kaluza - klein , superstring and m - theory require the existence of extra spatial dimensions which are compactified on small scales .",
    "the coupling constants in our 3-dimensional subspace of these theories are related to the scale sizes of the extra dimensions .",
    "therefore , if the extra dimensions evolve with cosmology , we expect our 3-dimensional constants to vary ( e.g. forgcs & horvth 1979 ; marciano 1984 ; barrow 1987 ; damour & polyakov 1994 ) .",
    "currently , there seems to be no mechanism for keeping the sizes of the extra dimensions constant ( li & gott 1998 ) and so these modern theories naturally predict variations in the fundamental constants .    experimentally , quasar ( qso ) absorption lines provide an ideal probe of cosmological variation of physical constants .",
    "savedoff ( 1956 ) first analysed doublet separations seen in galaxy emission spectra to obtain constraints on variation in the fine structure constant , @xmath11 .",
    "absorption lines in intervening clouds along the line of sight to qsos are substantially narrower than intrinsic emission lines and so provide a much more precise probe of @xmath1 at high redshift .",
    "bahcall , sargent & schmidt ( 1967 ) first used the doublet spacings of gas seen in absorption against background qsos to derive firm upper limits on possible variation of @xmath1 .",
    "we summarize results from optical absorption line studies in section [ sec : discussion ] , suffice it to say here that the tightest constraint on @xmath12 found to date is a tentative detection of variation at @xmath13 in 49 absorption clouds over the redshift range @xmath14 ( murphy et al .",

    "2001 ) .. ]    even tighter constraints can be placed on variability of combinations of physical constants using radio qso absorption spectra .",
    "a comparison of and molecular rotational absorption spectra is particularly convenient .",
    "the hyperfine transition frequency is proportional to @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the bohr magneton . here , @xmath2 is the proton g - factor , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the masses of the proton and electron respectively and @xmath20 is the bohr radius .",
    "the rotational transition frequencies of diatomic molecules , such as co , are proportional to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reduced mass .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the hyperfine and molecular rotational frequencies is proportional to @xmath23 . variations in this quantity will be dominated by variations in @xmath0 since variations in @xmath24 are suppressed by a factor @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the binding energy of nucleons in nuclei . if any variation in @xmath9 occurs , it will be observed as a difference in redshift between the ( @xmath27 ) , and molecular ( @xmath28 ) absorption lines : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the values of @xmath9 at the absorption redshift @xmath32 and in the laboratory respectively .",
    "the first comparison of and molecular absorption was made by varshalovich & potekhin ( 1996 ) .",
    "they compared the published redshifts of the co absorption ( reported in wiklind & combes 1994 ) and absorption ( reported in carilli , perlman & stocke 1992 ) towards .",

    "the errors on the redshift of each velocity component in the hi data were reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the estimates of varshalovich & potekhin ( 1996 ) .",
    "we also applied this analysis to another absorber towards  at @xmath36 . in d98",
    "we derived an upper limit on any variation in @xmath9 for both absorbers : @xmath37 .",
    "the present work aims at turning our upper limit on @xmath4 in d98 into a measurement of @xmath4 by fitting simultaneously the data _ and _ the rotational lines of several molecular species .",

    "we do not have sufficient data to consider pks1830@xmath35211 .",
    "the molecular absorption profile is very broad ( @xmath38 , wiklind & combes 1998 ) and so constraints on @xmath4 would be weak . we do not consider 3 any further due to a @xmath39 offset between the ( carilli et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) and hco@xmath40 ( wiklind & combes 1996 ) velocity scales as noted in d98 . checks on the origin of this difference have not revealed any instrumental or human error and so it may well be that the molecular and hi absorption occurs in different clouds .",

    "the low velocity component does not seem to be present in these transitions and was not fitted ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the fact that the results are insensitive to removal of these lines indicates the robustness of our line fitting method and highlights the advantage of using many different molecular transitions .",
    "the 1@xmath59 errors we quote above are statistical only .",
    "however , as noted in section [ sec : pks ] , the fact that we probe slightly different sight lines with the molecular and  observations may result in an additional random error .",
    "d98 have investigated this problem empirically by fitting several qso spectra with galactic absorption and comparing the fitted redshifts of the hco@xmath40 and hi velocity components .",

    "our two results , being of similar value and so close to zero , suggest that this error estimate may be too large .",
    "however , it is clear that such a conclusion can only be reached with a larger sample of absorption systems and so we have added this error in quadrature to obtain our final results : @xmath65 or @xmath66 assuming ( perhaps incorrectly ) a constant @xmath2 .",
    "very recently , c00 has reported upper limits on @xmath4 using the same two absorption systems we analyse above .",

    "however , c00 argue that the line of sight problem above could lead to errors as large as @xmath70 on the basis of typical sub - kiloparsec ism motions .",
    "they therefore conclude with an upper limit of @xmath71 ( assuming constant @xmath2 ) for a look - back time ( within their assumed cosmology ) of 4.8gyr to @xmath44 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath72 .",
    "this final dominant error term of @xmath73 is much greater than the @xmath63 error we apply in equations [ eq : resy ] and [ eq : resa ] but we stress that our value has been obtained empirically and so should be reliable .    as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , tight constraints on @xmath12 come from optical absorption line studies .",
    "one method is to compare the spacing of single alkali doublets ( ads ) in qso and laboratory spectra ( cowie & songaila 1995 ; varshalovich , panchuk & ivanchik 1996 ) . the most precise constraint to date using this method was obtained by murphy et al .",
    "( 2001c ) , @xmath74 , where we analysed 21 siiv doublets ( @xmath75 ) in 13 qso spectra ( see fig .",
    "however , this method does not take advantage of the large relativistic shifts in the ground state energy since it compares transitions from the same ground state .",
    "recently , a new many - multiplet ( mm ) method was suggested ( dzuba et al .",
    "1999a , b ; webb et al .",
    "1999 ) which allows an order of magnitude gain in precision over the ad method .",
    "the magnitude of the relativistic shifts is sensitive to the nuclear charge and so comparison of transitions in light and heavy ions yields tight constraints on @xmath12 .",
    "also , since any transition can be used , comparison of transitions with different ground states is possible .",
    "a further increase in precision comes from increased statistics since one is not restricted to using just a single ad .    the first application of the mm method ( webb et al .",
    "1999 ) used 30 mgi / mgii / feii absorption systems ( @xmath76 ) towards 17 qsos and suggested that @xmath1 may have been smaller in the past : @xmath77 .",
    "more recently , we have re - analysed and confirmed the webb et al .",
    "results with improved techniques and extended our analysis to a higher redshift sample of damped lyman-@xmath1 systems ( murphy et al .",
    "2001a ; webb et al .",
    "we compare our new mm / hi results with these optical results in fig . 3 and we see that they are consistent .",
    "the weighted mean for the optical results , @xmath78 , is significant at the 4.1@xmath59 level and so a thorough search for systematic errors has been carried out ( murphy et al .",
    "however , no effect was found that could explain the results .",
    "3 clearly shows that , assuming a constant @xmath2 , a large sample of mm / hi absorption systems , over a somewhat larger redshift range , will allow us to confirm or rule out the change in @xmath1 implied by the optical data .",
