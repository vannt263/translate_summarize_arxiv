    "a renewed interest in the lovelock gravity and born - infeld electrodynamics has appeared because they emerge in the low energy limit of string theory @xcite . the effect of string theory on the left hand side of field equations of gravity is usually investigated by means of a low energy effective action which describes gravity at the classical level @xcite .",
    "in addition to einstein - hilbert action , this effective action also involves higher derivative curvature terms . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , these higher derivative curvature terms correspond to the correction terms of large n expansion in the cft side @xcite . in general , the higher powers of curvature could give rise to a fourth or even higher order differential equation for the metric , and it would introduce ghosts and violate unitarity , therefore , the higher derivative terms may be a source of inconsistencies .",

    "they have also been shown to be ghost - free when expanding about flat space , evading any problem with unitarity @xcite . in this paper , we indulge ourselves to with the first three terms of the lovelock gravity , corresponding to the cosmological term , einstein and gauss - bonnet terms , respectively . it has been argued that the gauss - bonnet term appears as the leading correction to the low energy effective action of the string theory and its lagrangian is given by @xmath8 in gauss - bonnet gravity , static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions were firstly presented in @xcite , and of the charged in @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of these solutions have been investigated in @xcite , of solutions with nontrivial topology in @xcite and the charged black hole solutions in @xcite .",
    "besides the curvature terms , one would also expect higher derivative gauge field contributions to the action .",
    "this is done by explicitly constructing black holes solutions coupled to a born - infeld gauge field in the presence of a cosmological constant .",

    "the euclidean action for the grand canonical ensemble was computed with the appropriate boundary terms .",
    "the thermodynamical quantities such as the gibbs free energy , entropy and specific heat of the black holes are derived from it . for the lovelock gravity , the asymptotically flat born - infeld",
    "black hole solutions in gauss - bonnet gravity were found in @xcite , five dimensional ads black hole solutions in @xcite .",

    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ 22s ] , we present @xmath18 dimensional biads black hole solutions in gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "then , the thermodynamics of these black holes will be discussed for a fixed - charge . in order to simplify the analysis of the thermodynamic properties , we study gauss - bonnet - born - infeld black holes in five dimensional spacetimes and investigate the stability of black holes by computing heat capacity of black holes in section [ 33s ] .",
