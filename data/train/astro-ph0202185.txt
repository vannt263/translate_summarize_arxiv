    "blazars are the main class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) detected above 100 mev by the egret experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) and by ground - based @xmath0-ray observatories @xcite .",
    "they comprise a subclass of agn and are characterized by a highly variable non - thermal continuum , strong variable optical polarization , the lack of a uv - excess ( or `` blue bump '' ) and a core - dominated radio morphology .",
    "bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects are a subclass of blazars that are notable for their lack of prominent emission lines . the broad - band double - humped spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of bl lacs identified in x - ray surveys differ significantly from the seds of those identified in radio surveys .",
    "this led to the sub - classification of bl lacs into high - frequency - peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) and low - frequency - peaked bl lacs ( lbls ) based on the ratio of their x - ray to radio flux densities @xcite . the first `` hump '' , generally assumed to be the peak of the synchrotron emission ( in a @xmath7 representation ) , is in the ir - optical for lbls and in the euv - soft x - ray band for hbls .",
    "bl lac objects make up a significant fraction of the 70 blazars in the 3rd egret catalog @xcite and most of them are classified as lbls .",
    "it has been shown that there is not a sharp division between these two classes of objects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies with ground - based @xmath0-ray telescopes have produced evidence for tev @xmath0-ray emission from seven bl lac objects , five of which are classified as hbl and two as lbl @xcite .",
    "the most prominent of these are markarian 421 ( mrk 421 ) , which has been detected by five ground based imaging atmospheric erenkov  @xmath0-ray observatories , and markarian 501 ( mrk 501 ) , which has been detected by six such observatories . the emission from both of these objects can be explained by compton - synchrotron models although detailed modeling is still fraught with many uncertainties .",
    "both objects are characterized by rapid variability on time - scales from hours to months . in the tev energy range , the energy spectrum of mrk 501 and , more recently , that of mrk 421 , have been shown to exhibit absorption - like features @xcite .",
    "the temporal and spectral properties of the other tev bl lacs are less well defined .",
    "since 1992 , the whipple gamma ray collaboration , using the 10 m imaging atmospheric erenkov  telescope on mt .",
    "hopkins , has been searching for tev @xmath0-ray emission from agn .",
    "initially the search was concentrated on blazars detected by egret at any redshift ; these observations led to the detection of mrk 421 @xcite and upper limits on some 30 other blazars @xcite .",
    "more recently , the search has concentrated on nearby bl lacs leading to the detection of mrk 501 @xcite and 1es 2344 + 514 @xcite . between 1995 and 1998 ,",
    "the survey included 24 objects ( 17 hbls , 7 lbls ) ranging in redshift from 0.046 to 0.44 ; the results for these objects will be published shortly ( d. horan et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "although none of these observations resulted in a detection , the observations of h1426 + 428 yielded the highest consistently positive statistical significances .    in this paper ,",
    "evidence is presented for the detection of very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-rays from h1426 + 428 .",
    "the h1426 + 428 observations are divided into two categories - those taken as part of the general blazar survey between 1995 and 1998 , and the subsequent concentrated observations carried out between 1999 and 2001 .",
    "a preliminary energy spectrum is derived and the implications of the detection of h1426 + 428 at these energies are discussed .",
    "h1426 + 428 was discovered in the 2 - 6 kev band by heao-1 @xcite and was classified as a bl lac object in 1989 @xcite .",
    "it has a cosmological redshift of 0.129 and is located in the constellation of botes ( @xmath8 = 14@xmath9 28@xmath10 32@xmath11.7 , @xmath12 = + 42@xmath13 40@xmath14 20@xmath15 ) .",
    "it is an optically faint object ( m@xmath16 = 16.9 ) and is believed to be at the center of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "h1426 + 428 is bright in the x - ray band with a 2 - 6 kev luminosity of @xmath17 10@xmath18 erg s@xmath6 which is typical of the bl lacs found with heao-1 . both the flux of h1426 + 428 in the 2 - 10 kev band and its spectral index above 2 kev have been found to change over time @xcite .",
    "three recent bl lac surveys , dxrbs @xcite , rgb @xcite , and rex @xcite , have shown that , despite the conventional subdivision into hbls and lbls , bl lacs actually form a continuous class with respect to the peak of the synchrotron emission , which smoothly ranges between ir and soft x - ray frequencies and up to the 2 - 10 kev band for sources like mrk 421 . _",
    "beppo_-sax observations of mrk 501 @xcite and 1es 2344 + 514 @xcite revealed that , at least in a flaring state , the first peak of the sed can reach even higher energies , at or above 100 kev .    in 1998 - 1999 , _",
    "beppo_-sax performed an observing campaign with the aim of finding and studying other sources as `` extreme '' as mrk 501 is in its flaring state .",
    "the candidates for the _ beppo_-sax survey were selected from the einstein slew survey and the rassbsc catalogs . these",
    "_ beppo_-sax observations ( costamante et al .",
    "2000a , 2000b , 2001 ) revealed four new `` extreme '' hbls , selected because they have high synchrotron peak frequencies and are therefore possible tev emitters .",
    "these four candidates for tev emission were : 1es 0120 + 340 , pks 0548 - 322 , 1es 1426 + 42.8 ( i.e. h1426 + 428 ) and h2356 - 309 .",
    "the spectra for three of these objects ( 1es 0120 + 340 , pks 0548 - 322 , and h2356 - 309 ) were well fitted by a convex broken power law with a break energy , and hence the peak of the synchrotron emission , occurring at about 1.4 kev for 1es0120 + 340 , 4.4 kev for pks0548 - 322 and 1.8 kev for h2356 - 309 . in the case of h1426 + 428 however , no evidence for a spectral break up to 100 kev was found . instead",
    ", its spectrum was well fitted by a single power - law , with a flat spectral index of 0.92 up to 100 kev , thus constraining the peak of the synchrotron emission to lie near or above this value .",
    "the best fit of a pure homogeneous synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model for h1426 + 428 @xcite predicted detectable @xmath0-ray emission at tev energies . at the time of the _ beppo_-sax observation the observed x - ray flux in the 2 - 10 kev band was at one of the lowest levels",
    "ever recorded from h1426 + 428 , indicating that it was not in a flaring state @xcite .",
    "this implies that , in the event of a flare , the synchrotron peak could shift to even higher values as was observed for both mrk 501 and 1es 2344 + 514 .",
    "it also indicates that highly relativistic electrons are present which makes h1426 + 428 the most promising candidate for tev emission from this survey .",
    "the observations reported in this paper were taken with the 10 m reflector at the whipple observatory on mount hopkins in southern arizona ( elevation 2.3 km ) using the atmospheric erenkov  imaging technique . during the course of the observations presented here ,",
    "many changes were implemented on the 10 m telescope .",
    "the imaging camera @xcite was upgraded a number of times @xcite , the number of photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) being increased with each iteration , resulting in the current high resolution , 490 pixel camera @xcite .",
    "the triggering electronics were upgraded to a pattern selection trigger @xcite and light cones were installed in front of the pmts to increase their light collection efficiency .",
    "the unprotected , anodized , front - aluminized mirrors on the 10 m were recoated during the timespan of the observations . because of changes in pmt configuration , triggering , mirror reflectivity , and light collection efficiency , the energy response of the camera for @xmath0-ray detection varied .",
    "since various changes were made at the beginning of each observing season ( typically between june and september ) , it is convenient to consider each observing season separately and to characterize it by the observed response from the assumed standard candle , the crab nebula .",
    "the different configurations of the camera and the resultant peak response energies are summarized in table  [ configurations ] .",

    "the off run , a control run , is also taken for 28 sidereal minutes through the same range of azimuth and elevation , thus enabling this region of the atmosphere to be characterised in the absence of the @xmath0-ray candidate . in the tracking mode",
    ", the object is continuously tracked for 28 sidereal minutes with no control run being taken .    even in the absence of a @xmath0-ray source",
    ", a certain percentage of events recorded will pass all of the @xmath0-ray selection criteria .",
    "this background level of events , which depends on a number of factors including sky brightness , elevation , and weather , needs to be established in order to calculate the statistical significance of any apparent excess of @xmath0-rays detected .",
    "there are different methods to estimate this background depending on which mode of observation was used .    for data taken in on / off mode ,",
    "the off scan provides an estimate of the number of @xmath0-ray like events that would be recorded from this range of azimuth and elevation , in the absence of the candidate @xmath0-ray source . in this data acquisition mode",
    ", differences in night - sky brightness between the on and off regions of the sky can introduce a bias when the data are analyzed . in order to reduce this bias ,",
    "the standard deviations of the night - sky background in each pmt are compared for the on and the off runs .",
    "gaussian noise is then added in quadrature to the signal from whichever region of the sky ( on or off ) is the darker , so as to match the standard deviations for the tube in the on and off runs .",
    "this technique is known as software padding and is described in @xcite .    unlike observations taken in the on / off mode , scans taken in the tracking mode",
    "do not have independent control data .",
    "a background estimate is essential in order to predict what number of the background events , passing all cuts , would have been detected during the scan in the absence of the candidate @xmath0-ray source .",
    "since most of the h1426 + 428 observations were taken in the tracking mode , two different methods of background estimation were used .",
    "each of these methods is outlined below .    in the first method , which is the standard analysis method used for data taken in the tracking mode @xcite , the alpha plot was characterized when there was no @xmath0-ray source at the center of the field of view .",
    "this was done by analyzing darkfield data which consisted of data taken in the off mode , and of observations of objects found not to be sources of @xmath0-rays .",
    "a large database of these scans were analyzed , giving the shape that an alpha plot would be expected to have when no @xmath0-rays are present .",
    "most @xmath0-rays from an object at the center of the field of view will have small values of the _ alpha _ parameter .",
    "hence , the _ alpha _ distribution beyond 20@xmath19 can be assumed to be independent of the @xmath0-ray source , and thus representative of the background level of events in the field of view . using the darkfield data ,",
    "a ratio was calculated to scale the number of events between 20@xmath19 and 65@xmath19 to the number that pass the _ alpha _ cut .",
    "this ratio , the tracking ratio ( @xmath20 ) , was then used to scale the 20@xmath19 to 65@xmath19 region of the alpha plot for the tracking scan , to estimate the background level of events passing all cuts .",
    "its value and statistical uncertainty ( @xmath21 ) are given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined as the number of events in the darkfield data that pass all the @xmath0-ray selection criteria including the _ alpha _ cut , while @xmath24 is the number of such events with _ alpha _ between 20@xmath19 and 65@xmath19 .",
    "the tracking ratio was calculated using the darkfield data available for each observing year over the same range of elevation angles as the source observations .",
    "in addition , the tracking ratio was checked using the off data on h1426 + 428 from on / off runs ( where available ) ; within statistics these tracking ratios were consistent with the standard tracking ratio derived from the full yearly database . to check for systematic effects associated with the determination of the global tracking ratio ,",
    "the darkfield data were subdivided on the basis of the region of the sky which they were from .",
    "each of these dark - sky regions was checked individually and the tracking ratio determined and compared to the global tracking ratio .",
    "it was found that the global tracking ratio and these individual tracking ratios were consistent within statistical uncertainty .    in the alternative method for estimating the background , each h1426 + 428 tracking scan",
    "was assigned a suitable off scan as its background .",
    "the off database comprised all off scans taken during the observing season including h1426 + 428 off runs . in order to establish the most suitable off scan for each h1426 + 428 tracking scan ,",
    "each off run was characterized by parameters pertinent to the conditions during the scan .",
    "these consisted of the elevation , the number of pmts switched off and the mean night - sky background during that scan , along with the throughput factor recorded on the night of the scan and the date on which the scan was taken .",
    "the throughput factor @xcite is a measure of sky clarity based on the spectrum of the total amount of light produced by background cosmic rays .",
    "the same information was assembled for each h1426 + 428 tracking scan .",
    "then , for each h1426 + 428 tracking scan , the off scan whose conditions most closely matched it was deemed the most suitable background estimate , and was used as the background for that h1426 + 428 tracking run . in cases where there was not a suitable off run , the h1426 + 428 tracking run was omitted . with each h1426 + 428 tracking scan",
    "then having an associated off run , the data were analyzed as if they were taken in the on / off mode , and hence , software padding was applied . the sky quality changes from night to night , causing variations of @xmath25 in the raw trigger rate , for data taken on the same source at the same elevation .",
    "therefore , even after selecting off scans with run conditions which match those of the on scans , it is still necessary to normalize the total number of events on and off .",
    "we calculate the normalizing factor from the ratio of the number of events in the 30@xmath19 - 90@xmath19 control region of the on and off alpha plots .",
    "it was found that both methods of background estimation were consistent , and indicated excesses of similar significance , thus suggesting that the @xmath0-ray excess can be reliably determined for tracking scans .",
    "for the purpose of data analysis , two different strategies were employed : ( a ) all of the data taken in the on and the tracking modes were combined and subjected to a tracking analysis .",
    "( b ) all of the data taken in the on mode , along with their corresponding off data , were analyzed together using the pairs analysis .",
    "the @xmath0-ray selection criteria , including the _ alpha _ bound , were re - optimized each year using data from the crab nebula .",
    "the optimum value for the _ alpha _ bound was found empirically to increase from 10@xmath19 to 15@xmath19 when the smaller , high resolution 490 pixel camera was installed in the summer of 1999 .",
    "in june - july , 1995 , h1426 + 428 was observed for 3.5 hours in the tracking mode with the 109 pixel camera ( spacing 0.259@xmath19 , 3.0@xmath19 field of view and standard trigger ) . in february - june , 1997 ,",
    "another 13.2 hours were used to observe h1426 + 428 in the tracking mode ; the camera configuration was as before but the number of pixels was increased to 151 . in april , 1998 ,",
    "0.87 hours of h1426 + 428 data were taken ; the 331 pixel camera was installed at this time with the standard trigger .      during the 1999 observing season , a total of 7 on / off pairs and 51 tracking runs were taken with the 2-fold pattern selection trigger .",
    "three tracking runs were excluded from further analysis based on fluctuations in the raw rate and inferior weather conditions .",
    "this left a total of 24.35 hours ( 7 on runs and 48 tracking runs ) of data available for analysis .",
    "these observations were initiated as part of the general bl lac survey ( d. horan et al .",

    "however , the observed variations in sources such as mrk 501 can not be accounted for by simple one - zone homogeneous self - compton models and may require another source of optical target photons",
    ". it will require the detection of a greater population of sources such as h1426 + 428 to test these models fully .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that these tev - emitting bl lacs are also characterized by a relatively strong radio luminosity and that the radio luminosity may be a measure of the density of additional seed photons at infrared - optical wavelengths needed to explain the tev emission .",
    "this is the most distant of the tev - detected bl lacs classified as hbl , and hence it has promising implications for the detection of more bl lacs at @xmath48 @xmath2 0.1 .",
    "stronger detections of such sources , which allow an accurate measure of the tev energy spectrum , may place significant limits on the density of the intergalactic background light .",
    "the steep spectrum derived here is consistent with many models of intergalactic absorption but could also be intrinsic to the source .",
    "interpretation of the theoretical prediction of the intrinsic spectrum of h1426 + 428 and the observational results reported in this paper are complicated by the possible strong attenuation of the high energy photons by the diffuse intergalactic infrared background .",
    "the appearance of such a cutoff in the spectra of tev extragalactic sources was suggested in one of the pioneering works on tev @xmath0-ray absorption , by @xcite , for the quasar 3c 279 ( @xmath48 = 0.54 ) .",
    "a later paper ( v. v. vassiliev et al . , in preparation ) will discuss this subject in detail in relation to h1426 + 428 ; here we note only that at 280 gev the attenuation optical depth can be anywhere between @xmath48 of 0.1 and 1.0 depending on the extreme upper and lower limits known for the density of the extragalactic background light . due to this potentially large absorption effect it is possible , for example , that the intrinsic spectral index of this source is softened by @xmath17 1.75 to produce the observed value of 3.55 , if the intrinsic properties of h1426 + 428 are similar to those of mrk 501 @xcite .",
    "it remains certain however , that being the most distant hbl detected at sub - tev energies , the observed spectral properties of h1426 + 428 and the understanding of its intrinsic characteristics from multiwavelength observations will provide the most constraining data for extragalactic background light studies .",
