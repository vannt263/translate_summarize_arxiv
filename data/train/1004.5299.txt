    "model studies of dense baryonic and quark matter have suggested a rich phase structure of qcd at temperatures and quark chemical potentials being of order @xmath3 .",
    "our knowledge on the phase structure is however still limited and the description of the matter around the phase transitions does not reach a consensus because of the non - perturbative nature of qcd  @xcite .",
    "possible phases and spectra of excitations are guided by symmetries and their breaking pattern in a medium .",
    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement are characterized by strict order parameters associated with global symmetries of the qcd lagrangian in two limiting situations : the quark bilinear @xmath4 in the limit of massless quarks , and the polyakov loop @xmath5 in the limit of infinitely heavy quarks .    a novel phase of dense quarks , quarkyonic phase ,",
    "was recently proposed based on the argument using large @xmath0 counting where @xmath0 denotes number of colors  @xcite : in the large @xmath0 limit there are three phases which are rigorously distinguished using @xmath5 and the baryon number density @xmath6 .",
    "the quarkyonic phase is characterized by @xmath7 indicating the system confined and non - vanishing @xmath6 above @xmath8 with a baryon mass @xmath9 .",
    "a possible deformation of the phase boundaries in large @xmath0 together with the chiral phase transition can be described using a chiral model coupled to the polyakov loop  @xcite .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio model with polyakov loops ( pnjl model ) has been developed to deal with chiral dynamics and `` confinement '' simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "the model describes that only three - quark states are thermally relevant below the chiral critical temperature , which is reminiscent of confinement .",
    "figure  [ pnjl ] shows the two transition lines for @xmath10 and for @xmath1 in the two - flavored pnjl model .",
    "@xcite . , width=302 ]    in the large @xmath0 limit assuming that the system is confined , the gap equations for the order parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 become two uncorrelated equations .",
    "consequently , the quark dynamics carries only a @xmath11 dependence and the polyakov loop sector does only a @xmath12 dependence .",
    "finite @xmath0 corrections make the transition lines bending down .",
    "the crossover for deconfinement shows a weak dependence on @xmath11 which is a remnant of the phase structure in large @xmath0 .",
    "one finds that for @xmath1 deconfinement and chiral crossover lines are on top of each other in a wide range of @xmath11 .",
    "a critical point associated with chiral symmetry appears around the junction of those crossovers .",
    "the clear separation of the quarkyonic from hadronic phase is lost in a system with finite @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , an abrupt change in the baryon number density would be interpreted as the quarkyonic transition which separates meson dominant from baryon dominant regions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a steep increase in the baryon number density and the corresponding maximum in its susceptibility @xmath13 are driven by a phase transition from chirally broken to restored phase in most model - approaches using constituent quarks .",
    "one might then consider the chirally symmetric confined phase as the quarkyonic phase .",
    "the constituent quarks are however unphysical in confined phase .",
    "it is not obvious to have a realistic description of hadrons from chiral quarks . in particular ,",
    "chiral symmetry restoration for baryons must be worked out .",
    "two alternatives for chirality assignment are known  @xcite and it remains an open question which scenario is preferred by nature : ( i ) in the naive assignment , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking generates a baryon mass which thus vanishes at the restoration .",
    "( ii ) in the mirror assignment , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking generates a mass difference between parity partners and the chiral symmetry restoration does not necessarily dictate the chiral partners being massless . if the chiral invariant mass is not very small , the baryon number density is supposed to be insensitive to the quarkyonic transition .    besides",
    ", it seems unlikely that the chirally - restored confined phase is realized in qcd on the basis of the anomaly matching : external gauge fields , e.g. photons , interacting with quarks lead to anomalies in the axial current .",
    "since there are no nambu - goldstone bosons in chiral restored phase , the anomalous contribution must be generated from the triangle diagram in which the baryons are circulating . in three flavors , however , the baryons forming an octet do not contribute to the pole in the axial current because of the cancellations  @xcite .",
    "the mirror scenario has nothing to do with this problem because the sign of the axial couplings to the positive and negative parity states are relatively opposite .",
    "it is indispensable to any rigorous argument for this taking account of the physics around the fermi surface , which could lead to a possibility of the chirally restored phase with confinement .",
    "the anomaly matching conditions at finite temperature and density are in fact altered , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there is a possibility of two different phases with broken chiral symmetry distinguished by the baryon number density .",
    "an alternative pattern of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking was suggested in the context of qcd at zero temperature and density  @xcite .",
    "this pattern keeps the center of chiral group unbroken , i.e. @xmath14 where a discrete symmetry @xmath15 is the maximal axial subgroup of @xmath16 .",
    "the center @xmath17 symmetry protects a theory from condensate of quark bilinears @xmath4 .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is driven by quartic condensates which are invariant under both @xmath18 and @xmath17 transformation .",
    "although meson phenomenology with this breaking pattern seems to explain the reality reasonably  @xcite , this possibility is strictly ruled out in qcd both at zero and finite temperatures but at zero density since a different way of coupling of nambu - goldstone bosons to pseudo - scalar density violates qcd inequalities for density - density correlators  @xcite .",
    "however , this does not exclude the unorthodox pattern in the presence of dense matter . in a system with the breaking pattern  ( [ breaking ] )",
    "the quartic condensate is the strict order parameter which separates different chirally - broken phases  .",
    "assuming  ( [ breaking ] ) at finite density , it has been shown that an intermediate phase between chiral symmetry broken and its restored phases can be realized using a general ginzburg - landau free energy  @xcite .",
    "the pion decay constant is read from the noether current as @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the expectation values of 4-quark and 2-quark scalar fields , determined from the gap equations .",
    "the effective potential deduced in the mean field approximation describes three distinct phases characterized by the two order parameters : phase i represents the system where both chiral symmetry and its center are spontaneously broken due to non - vanishing expectation values @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the center symmetry is restored when @xmath21 becomes zero .",
    "however , chiral symmetry remains broken as long as @xmath20 is non - vanishing , where the pure 4-quark state is the massless nambu - goldstone boson ( phase ii ) .",
    "the chiral symmetry restoration takes place under @xmath22 which corresponds to phase iii .",
    "the phases ii and iii are separated by a second - order line , while the broken phase i from ii or from iii is by both first- and second - order lines .",
    "accordingly , there exist two tricritical points ( tcps ) and one triple point",
    ". one of these tcp is associated with the center @xmath23 symmetry restoration rather than the chiral transition . with an explicit breaking of chiral symmetry",
    "one would draw a phase diagram mapped onto @xmath24 plane as in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .     plane .",
    ", width=302 ]    appearance of the above intermediate phase seems to have a similarity to the notion of quarkyonic phase .",
    "the transition from hadronic to quarkyonic world can be characterized by a rapid change in the net baryon number density . in our model",
    "this feature is driven by the restoration of center symmetry and is due to the fact that the yukawa coupling of @xmath25 to baryons is not allowed by the @xmath23 invariance .",
    "consequently , the baryon number susceptibility exhibits a maximum when across the @xmath23 cross over .",
    "this can be interpreted as the realization of the quarkyonic transition in @xmath1 world .",
    "the phase with @xmath26 and @xmath27 does not seem to appear in the large @xmath0 limit  @xcite .",
    "it would be expected that including @xmath28 corrections induce a phase with unbroken center symmetry .",
    "we have discussed the phases in dense qcd from chiral approaches along with the anomaly matching which is a field - theoretical requirement .",
    "although the chiral restored phase below `` deconfinement '' seems to be a common feature in pnjl models , this might be an artifact of this toy model in which the temporal gluon field is treated as a constant background and thus confinement dynamics is lost .",
    "a possibility of a non - standard breaking pattern leads to a new phase where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken while its center symmetry is restored .",
    "this might appear as an intermediate phase between chirally broken and restored phases in @xmath24 plane .",
    "the appearance of this phase also suggests a new critical point in low temperatures .",
    "a tendency of the center symmetry restoration is carried by the net baryon number density which shows a rapid increase indicating baryons more activated , and this is reminiscent of the quarkyonic transition .",
    "the properties of baryons near the chiral phase transition are also an issue to be clarified . depending on the chirality assignment to baryons , equations of state",
    "may be altered .",
    "the chirality assignment becomes more involved when one introduces axial - vector mesons  @xcite . in this case",
    "the axial - vector meson gives a non - trivial contribution to the axial couplings and eventually it is not clear that the sign of the axial coupling to the negative parity state does distinguish two scenarios . in this respect",
    ", it attracts an interest that the same sign of the axial couplings to the parity partners is predicted in a top - down holographic qcd model  @xcite and the lattice qcd with dynamical quarks  @xcite .",
