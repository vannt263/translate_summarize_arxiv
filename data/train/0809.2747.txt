    "0.1 in magnetic fields play crucial roles in the interstellar environments of galaxies and are observed on on a number of scales in galaxies , up to scale lengths of 8kpc for the regular , organized fields in the disks ( e.g. , beck 2004 , beck and gaensler 2006 ) .",
    "radio synchrotron observations are one of the best ways to probe magnetic fields across galaxies as radio waves are not subject to interstellar extinction . in addition to revealing maps of the magnetic field structure ,",
    "radio observations give estimates for the mean equipartition magnetic field strengths in galaxies from @xmath1 10 - 20 @xmath2 g in galactic spiral arms , and @xmath140 @xmath2 g in galactic nuclear regions .",
    "the central regions of galaxies harbor some of the most extreme physical phenomena , including dense stellar clusters , non - circular motions of molecular clouds and strong and pervasive magnetic field structures .",
    "in addition , studies across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal that galactic nuclei are major sites of episodic and energetic phenomena related both to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and also to intense bursts of star formation .",
    "recently , studies of the circumnuclear regions of several galaxies have revealed that magnetic fields in this part of the galaxy may help to transport materials into the nuclear region ( which then may fuel a starburst or agn ) . in the barred galaxies , ngc1097 and ngc1365",
    ", radio emission is enhanced along the bar regions , indicating the presence of a shock front .",
    "further , magnetic stresses in the circumnuclear ring can then drive mass inwards at rates high enough to feed nuclear activity ( beck _ et al _ 1999 ; 2005 ) . in the spiral",
    "ringed galaxy m94 ( ngc4736 ) the polarized radio emission reveals a pattern of ordered magnetic field arising from the central regions of the galaxy that may be where magnetic amplification occurs ( chyzy and buta 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , the expulsion of materials from the nucleus may also be regulated by magnetic fields .",
    "energetic events arising from star - burst or agn activity in the nucleus often result in explosive vertical `` fountains '' of million degree gas , rising 12kiloparsec ( kpc ) above galactic nuclear regions ( e.g. , ngc1569 and ngc4631 ; heckman _ et al _ 1995 ) .",
    "these fountains may well be related to vertical magnetic field structures and outflow from the galactic disk ( e.g. , ngc4631 ; golla and hummel 1994 ) .",
    "detailed knowledge of the violent interplay between stellar and magnetized interstellar components is limited for most galactic nuclei because of their great distances , even for the most sophisticated observational instrumentation . at a distance of only 8.0kpc",
    ", the center of our milky way galaxy provides an excellent laboratory for detailed studies of the interplay of massive stars , gas and , importantly , magnetic fields . because of",
    "the nearly 30 magnitudes of visual extinction toward this region of our galaxy , studies at radio wavelengths have proved to be fruitful in understanding the details of the magnetized interstellar medium and for understanding the nuclei of nearby , normal galaxies .",
    "0.1 in      0.1 in one of the most striking aspects of the radio continuum image of our galactic center ( gc ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the presence of the narrow linear features oriented essentially perpendicular to the orientation of the galactic plane .",
    "first detected with the vla by yusef - zadeh , morris and chance ( 1984 ) , the 8 well - known non - thermal filaments ( ntfs ) have the following properties ( gray _ et al _ 1995 ; yusef - zadeh _ et al _ 1997 ; lang _ et al _ 1999a ) : ( 1 ) show strong linear polarization ( 30@xmath350% in most cases ) and ( 2 ) have intrinsic magnetic field orientations aligned along their lengths , indicating that they may trace a large - scale poloidal magnetic field ( e.g. , morris and serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "the magnetic field traced by these ntfs is opposite to the orientation of the magnetic field in the galactic disk , which is azimuthal and follows the spiral arms .",
    "several theories have explored the origin and stability of such a field structure ( chandran , cowley and morris 2000 ; chandran 2001 ) .",
    "one idea is that the magnetic field may be pervasive throughout the gc , with the ntfs representing sites of relativistic particles ( morris 1994 ) .",
    "more recently , many new ntfs have been detected with lower surface brightnesses , shorter extents and many different orientations ( lang _ et al _ 1999b ; larosa _ et al _ 2004 ; yusef - zadeh _ et al _ 2004 ) and the overall structure of the magnetic field has yet to be fully uncovered .",
    "et al _ ( 2005 ) suggest that the numerous weak and randomly - oriented filamentary structures suggest a much weaker , more local and dynamic field configuration in this region of the galaxy .",
    "very large array ( vla ) 1.4ghz mosaic of the central 200 pc of the gc from the recent hi absorption study ( lang _ et al _ _ in prep .",
    "crosses represent the positions of 90 pointings made with the vla at 4.9ghz in order to cover this same region with full - polarization imaging at @xmath4 angular resolution.,scaledwidth=68.0% ]    the magnetic pressure for field strengths of 0.11 mg ( which is what is estimated for the magnetic field in the gc ) corresponds to 4 @xmath510@xmath6 to 4 @xmath510@xmath7 erg @xmath8 and is likely to be balanced by the pressure from the hottest interstellar components .",
    "careful comparisons between diffuse x - ray emission and radio features can provide insight on this balance .",
    "the results of wang , gotthelf and lang ( 2002 ) show that the diffuse x - ray emission is consistent with t@xmath110@xmath9 k hot gas , which corresponds to a pressure in the hot component of @xmath11@xmath35@xmath510@xmath6 erg @xmath8 for a particle density of 0.1@xmath30.5 @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the correlation between the diffuse , hot x - ray emission and the magnetic features in the gc region has important implications for the confinement of hot gas , and the ultimate transport of such energetic ism components out of the nuclear region of the galaxy ( e.g. , shibata and uchida 1987 ) .      0.1 in although a number of lower frequency surveys of the gc have recently been made ( nord _ et al _ 2004 ;",
    "yusef - zadeh _ et al _ 2004 ) , uniform coverage at a higher frequency ( @xmath10 1.4ghz ) has not been carried out until this work .",
    "in particular , large rotation measures ( @xmath11  rad  m@xmath12 ) toward the gc ( yusef - zadeh _ et al _ 1997 ; lang _ et al _ 1999a , b ) cause complete depolarization at  1.4ghz , which is why this 4.9ghz survey is ideally suited for detecting polarized intensity from magnetized features in the gc , including the enigmatic new `` streaks '' ( ntf - candidates ) ( nord _ et al _ 2004 ; yusef - zadeh _ et al _ 2004 ) .",
    "determining whether the new ntf - candidate sources are polarized may allow us to uncover an underlying magnetic field structure in the gc and will greatly increase the number of ntf sources in this region .",
    "we have begun to construct the first 4.9ghz mosaic of the gc region made from 90 pointings in d - configuration and 50 pointings in c - configuration with the vla in order to study extended structures in total and polarized intensity .",
    "observations were made during 2003 - 2006 , and data calibration for all fields in both configurations is nearly completed .",
    "the quality of the data is very high and the total integration time on source is @xmath175 minutes per pointing .",
    "the combination of data from these two configurations should provide sensitivity to diffuse large - scale structures but also have a final angular resolution of @xmath1310@xmath0 .",
    "mosaicking such a large and complex region in full stokes mode ( i.e. , both total and polarized intensity ) has proven to be a challenge . the multi - scale clean algorithm available in _ casa _ , the new software package being developed by the national radio astronomy observatory is designed for fields like our gc mosaic , which have a substantial diffuse component in addition to numerous compact sources .",

    "( lower right ) : inset of polarized intensity from the c - array mosaic , with 4 ntfs at positive galactic latitudes labeled with white arrows . ]",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows preliminary images from both the d- and c - configuration data in total and polarized intensity .",
    "the preliminary results are promising , revealing newfound detail in several areas : ( 1 ) numerous compact and extended features in the region between sgra and sgrc , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( lower left ) , have not been previously studied in the radio continuum with such high resolution .",
    "a number of these sources appear to have shell - like morphology which indicates they may be tracing massive star - forming activities .",
    "several of these sources have mid - ir counterparts in recently published _",
    "images ( stolovy _ et al _ _ in prep . _ ) ; ( 2 ) the survey has begun to reveal polarized intensity from several candidate ntfs , and upon further polarization corrections , we hope to uncover many more polarized counterparts to candidate ntfs .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ( lower right ) shows strong polarized intensity from four of the well - known ntfs ; finally , ( 3 ) the c - configuration data show a large number of new compact sources which will assist in understanding the true radio point source population in the gc and the nature of these sources ( e.g. , pulsars , extragalactic , etc . ) .",
    "when completed , by combining the d- and c - configuration data and producing a complete source catalog for total and polarized intensity , this survey should be able to address the following questions : ( 1 ) are the numerous ntf - candidates polarized , and if so , do they trace out an underlying complex magnetic field structure , ( 2 ) is the magnetic field in the gc region strong and pervasive or weak and diffuse with enhancements ?",
    "( 3 ) how do massive stars impact the ism ? and",
    "( 4 ) what is the radio point - source population at the gc ?",
    "0.1 in our results from the gc indicate that the magnetic field is strong and well - organized in this region and plays an important role in the transport of plasma and energy out of the nuclear region .",
    "we have therefore begun an archival investigation of the central regions of the nearest , normal - type galaxies ( analogs to the milky way ) . a search for similarly coherent magnetized features in nearby galaxies will allow us to better understand the role and uniqueness of the magnetic fields in the gc of the milky way .",
    "0.1 in the best targets for such a study are located at distances @xmath13 10mpc , so that 1@xmath0  ( which is a typical resolution of the vla ) resolution corresponds to no more than about 50 pc .",
    "in addition , potential targets should be normal galaxies not thought to be undergoing a large starburst episode ( although may have in the past ) .",
    "the study of extended , polarized features in m81 illustrates that the nuclear regions of other normal galaxies may be rich in magnetized and filamentary features similar to those found in our own galactic center(kaufman _ et al _ 1996 ) .",
    "these authors used the vla in all its configurations at both 1.4 and 4.9ghz to obtain 1@xmath0  and better spatial resolution .",
    "et al _ ( 1996 ) identify a large - scale ( up to 1kpc ) magnetized  arc \" within the inner 1kpc of the galaxy , indicating that the interstellar magnetic field in this region is well - organized .",
    "in addition , the compact source in the center of m81 ( m81@xmath15 ; brunthaler _ et al _ 2001 ) has been found to be one of the best analogs to the gc compact source sgra@xmath15 .",
    "et al _ ( 2005 ) have used a large number of 4.9ghz multi - configuration , archival , vla observations of the nuclear regions of m31 and identified a non - thermal filamentary structure at very weak flux levels in the central kpc of the galaxy . using the vla archive , we identified multi - configuration , multi - frequency radio continuum observations of the nuclear regions of the above galaxies at 1.4 or 4.9ghz in the a , b and c array configurations .",
