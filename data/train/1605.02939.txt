    "the reconstruction of a state of any quantum system belongs to the most important tasks in quantum physics  @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "homodyne detection has been suggested and experimentally implemented for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite for quantum light .",
    "this was the first successful example of the so - called quantum state tomography , that provides the full information about the analyzed quantum state .",
    "the knowledge of the quantum state of light is extraordinarily important , as such states are useful for testing the postulates of quantum mechanics , showing peculiar features of quantum states ( teleportation @xcite , dense coding  @xcite , etc . ) , as well as applying them in metrology and other applications ( cryptography @xcite ) .    the optical homodyne tomography both in its cw and pulsed variants has become the most advanced and also powerful method in quantum state tomography  @xcite and , as such",
    ", it has become an indispensable technique in the field of quantum optics .",
    "the method is based upon overlapping an unknown state with a classical light ( coherent state ) with a well - defined phase , that is called a local oscillator .",
    "the interference pattern depending on the varying phase of the local oscillator then allows to reconstruct the quantum state , in detail to reconstruct its wigner function defined in the phase space  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , moments of the field operators can be obtained and used to fully characterize nonclassicality of the analyzed quantum state  @xcite .",
    "however , the optical homodyne tomography is quite experimentally involved and requires extended experimental data sets  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a simplified method still relying on the coherent local oscillator has been suggested for quantum state tomography in @xcite , and later elaborated in @xcite . in this method ,",
    "one of the output ports of a beam splitter that mixes the analyzed light with the local oscillator is monitored in general by a photon - number resolving detector with the varying attenuation coefficient .",
    "also an attempt to use the data measured under different levels of noise for quantum state tomography has been made @xcite .    in many cases ,",
    "the light to be analyzed has specific properties that allow to apply simpler tools in the determination of its state .",
    "for example , when we analyze the properties of twin beams generated from the vacuum state by parametric down - conversion  @xcite , the characterization by means of the measured photocount statistics is fully sufficient @xcite .",
    "this possibility originates in the generation process that does not ` prescribe ' specific phases to the individual signal and idler fields . here , the generated light is gaussian without coherent components , i.e. it is completely characterized by means of its covariance matrix .",
    "once the covariance matrix of a given state is obtained , all the properties of the state are easily derived . as useful examples , entanglement of a two - mode twin beam or local nonclassicalities of one - mode reduced states",
    "can be mentioned  @xcite .",
    "even phase - space quasidistributions of integrated intensities can be determined @xcite .    whereas the analysis of covariance matrices of gaussian two - mode twin beams is not difficult since only certain elements of their covariance matrices are nonzero , the measurement of covariance matrices belonging to a general two - mode gaussian state is more involved . to cope with this problem ,",
    "we have developed a method for reconstructing the normally- or symmetrically - ordered covariance matrix of such a general two - mode gaussian state based on mixing the analyzed state with a reference twin beam with the varying overall phase .",
    "moreover , the developed approach can be extended to multimode gaussian states provided that the measurement on individual mode pairs can be performed .",
    "this is useful , e.g. , for spectrally multimode twin beams composed of @xmath0 paired modes . even in this case",
    ", the genuine multimode entanglement of the state can be retrieved from its multimode covariance matrix @xcite .",
    "a specific example of this general approach was studied by altepeter _",
    "et al_.  @xcite who reconstructed the polarization state of a photon pair by acquiring photon coincidence - count statistics .",

    "all possible correlation functions can then be easily derived @xcite .",
    "the coefficients occurring in the normally - ordered covariance matrix @xmath20 give also the coefficients in the symmetrically - ordered covariance matrix @xmath21  @xcite , which is important for the determination of entanglement .",

    "( [ cf4 ] ) in the form : @xmath77 now , applying the photodetection theory for the detectors with quantum detection efficiencies @xmath78 and dark - count rates @xmath79 , we arrive at the following second - order moments of photocount fluctuations at all four detectors : @xmath80 applying further eqs .",
