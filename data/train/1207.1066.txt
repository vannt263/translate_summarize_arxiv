    "@xmath0-symmetric quantum systems  @xcite have emerged as an intriguing complex generalization of conventional quantum mechanics and have been a focus for numerous investigations at the interface between theoretical physics and applied mathematics .",
    "the key premise is that fundamental physical symmetries such as parity @xmath1 and time reversal @xmath2 may be sufficient ( in suitable parametric regimes ) to ensure that the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are real .",
    "thus , @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians provide an alternative to the standard postulate that the hamiltonian operator be dirac hermitian ( invariant under matrix transposition and complex conjugation @xmath3 ) . in the context of schrdinger hamiltonians with a complex potential @xmath4",
    ", the constraint of @xmath0 symmetry requires that the potential satisfy @xmath5 ; that is , @xmath4 has a symmetric real part and an antisymmetric imaginary part .",
    "on the other hand , _ nonlinear _ schrdinger ( nls ) equations incorporating double - well potentials have received attention due to applications in atomic and optical physics .",
    "such potentials can easily be realized in the context of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) through the combination of a parabolic ( harmonic ) trap with a periodic potential .",
    "experiments have observed fundamental effects , including tunneling and josephson oscillations for small atom numbers , macroscopic quantum self - trapped states for large atom numbers @xcite , and nonlinearity - induced symmetry - breaking dynamical instabilities @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies accompanying these developments have examined finite - mode reductions , analysis of the bifurcations and their dynamical implications @xcite , as well as quantum effects @xcite and nonlinear variants of the potentials @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenology has also been found in nonlinear optical settings , with results for the formation of asymmetric states in dual - core fibers @xcite , self - guided laser beams in kerr media @xcite , and optically - induced dual - core waveguide structures in photorefractive crystals @xcite .",
    "recently , double - well potentials in the context of @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear systems have received considerable attention .",
    "this is due to the pioneering work of christodoulides and collaborators , who proposed that nonlinear optics presents a fertile ground for the experimental realization of @xmath0-symmetric systems .",
    "the first realization of @xmath0-symmetry in a waveguide coupler arose in the so - called passive-@xmath0 setting in which two waveguides , one with loss and the other without loss , were used @xcite .",
    "a similar proposal for the existence of a leaking dimer ( in the presence of nonlinearity ) was formulated in the atomic setting of bose - hubbard models @xcite .",
    "subsequently , an optical waveguide system with both gain and loss was studied and the role of the nonlinearity in the dynamics was explored @xcite .",
    "further experimental investigations were concerned with electrical analogs of the system @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations have rapidly followed by examining such dimer - type settings @xcite and generalizations thereof , including ones where the gain - loss contributions appear in a balanced form in front of the nonlinear term @xcite .",
    "this paper revisits this theme of @xmath0-symmetric double - well potentials .",
    "our motivation is to unify the above studies with an important recent contribution , namely , ref .",
    "@xcite . to be specific , in the early works on nls models with double - well potentials @xcite , and also in the @xmath0-symmetric dimer @xcite",
    ", the symmetry - breaking bifurcation was identified , but the asymmetric states that normally accompany the bifurcation @xcite could not be identified",
    ". the simpler system of a @xmath0-symmetric pair of @xmath6-function potentials , where the solution can be obtained by means of a five - dimensional numerical root search , was studied in ref .",
    "there , it was found that the bifurcation results in the emergence of what we call a _ ghost state _ , namely , a solution of the steady - state problem with a _",
    "complex _ nonlinear eigenvalue parameter ( complex propagation constant in optics or complex chemical potential in becs ) .",
    "[ these states were discussed in a 2006 paper for the case of the ( discrete ) leaking dimer @xcite . ] another observation of ref .",
    "@xcite concerned the possibility of performing an _ analytic continuation _ of the symmetric and antisymmetric solutions of the original double - well problem _ past the point of their @xmath0 phase transition _ ; that is , past the critical point of the saddle - center bifurcation where they disappear simultaneously .",
    "this is in the broader spirit of @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study an nls model with a double - well potential , which has an even real part and a @xmath0-symmetric imaginary part .",
    "we combine the above ideas , interweaving analytics based on the two - mode analysis of the simple dimer model and numerics in the framework of the partial differential equation ( pde ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the two - mode analysis of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) dimer in sec .",
    "ii , where we examine the symmetric / antisymmetric and asymmetric states and the potential for nonlinearity - induced symmetry - breaking bifurcations .",
    "we show how the @xmath0-symmetric variant of the dimer problem adjusts these features .",
    "the modified critical point of the pitchfork bifurcation is identified , and the feature of a saddle - center bifurcation , which is a nonlinear analog of the @xmath0 phase transition , is discussed in the spirit of some of the earlier work on this theme .",
    "the key by - products of these bifurcations , namely , the ghost states emanating from the pitchfork and the analytically continued states past the nonlinear analog of the @xmath0 phase transition , are found in _ analytical _ form .",
    "armed with these analytical results , we study the full pde problem in sec .",
    "iii , where the aim is to reduce the pde , through suitable and fully quantified approximations and transformations ( so that one can translate the dimer results to the pde and vice - versa ) , to a @xmath0-symmetric dimer . in sec .",
    "iv we compare the analytical results concerning the dimer problem with numerical ones obtained in the framework of the original nls model .",
    "in addition to quantifying the bifurcations and identifying their `` daughter '' states , we examine the dynamics of the various unstable states within the system . finally , in sec .",
    "v we briefly summarize our findings and present some possibilities for further study .",
    "we begin our exposition by revisiting a simpler initial problem that has been long studied ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , namely the dnls dimer of the form @xmath7 where overdots denote derivatives with respect to the evolution variable @xmath8 ( which denotes the propagation distance in optics ) . as is customary , we seek stationary solutions of the form @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where the complex amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the propagation constant @xmath13 are determined by the equations @xmath14 using a polar representation of the two `` sites '' , namely @xmath15 , @xmath16 , we immediately obtain @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , and hence the resulting equations for the amplitudes are @xmath19 the simpler solutions of the above system are symmetric ones of amplitudes @xmath20 with the upper ( lower ) sign corresponding to the in - phase ( out - of - phase ) profile .",
    "in addition , there exist asymmetric solutions of amplitudes @xmath21 , which can be determined by the following equations derived by eliminating @xmath13 from ( [ e3 ] ) : @xmath22 the amplitudes @xmath23 , @xmath24 exist _ only _ for @xmath25 and thus for @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "these asymmetric solutions coincide with the symmetric ones at @xmath28 , and hence a _ pitchfork _ symmetry - breaking bifurcation is responsible for their emergence in the nonlinear problem . as is known from previous works  @xcite , this bifurcation arises for the focusing ( attractive ) nonlinearity case @xmath29 at the point @xmath30 , and does so from the symmetric branch . however , in the defocusing ( repulsive ) case @xmath31 the bifurcation arises when @xmath32 and the asymmetric solution emerges from the antisymmetric branch .",
    "this bifurcation picture is also complemented by the stability eigenvalues for the focusing and defocusing cases below ( see sec .",
    "ii.b ) .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath0-symmetric variant of the dnls dimer , as it was recently analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the experimental investigation of ref .",
    "this setting is described by the system @xmath33 which incorporates matched linear loss and gain of strength @xmath34 acting on the components @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the stationary equations have the form @xmath37    using the same polar decomposition as before , we find that the amplitudes and phase difference of the symmetric solutions satisfy @xmath38 where the signs in ( [ e7 ] ) correspond to the first ( @xmath39 ) and second ( @xmath40 ) branches .",
    "these two solutions exist _ only _ up to @xmath41 , while there is no such limit in the hermitian case @xmath42 .",
    "the latter is the critical threshold for the @xmath0 symmetry breaking of the underlying linear problem , whose eigenvalues are @xmath43 . beyond this critical value the eigenvalues",
    "become imaginary . additionally , as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stability eigenvalues of this @xmath0-symmetric dimer are @xmath44^{1/2}\\ ] ] for the @xmath45 branch and @xmath46^{1/2}\\ ] ] for the @xmath47 branch .    for the case @xmath42 ( see sec .",
    "ii.a ) , these eigenvalues describe the critical value of @xmath13 , where the two branches become unstable , and the pitchfork bifurcation leading to the asymmetric states emerges . specifically , if @xmath29 ( focusing nonlinearity ) , the first branch corresponding to the symmetric solutions becomes unstable at @xmath30 ; if @xmath31 ( defocusing nonlinearity ) , the destabilization arises when @xmath32 , and this happens for the second branch corresponding to the antisymmetric branch @xmath48 .",
    "similar stability conclusions occur for @xmath49 , where only the @xmath45 branch becomes unstable , but now also for @xmath50 .",
    "this suggests that there are two possibilities . if the propagation constant @xmath13 ( and the coupling strength @xmath51 ) are such that @xmath52 , then the instability is induced by the increase of the @xmath0-symmetry parameter @xmath34 at the critical point . however , if @xmath53 , the instability has `` already '' taken place due to the presence of nonlinearity , and the @xmath45 branch is unstable even in the @xmath42 limit . in the latter case",
    "the presence of the gain - loss aspect only enhances the instability .    what has become of the pitchfork bifurcation picture explored earlier ?",
    "we can see that the same instability is present here ( at least if @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , analogs of the symmetry - broken states past the critical point , i.e. , stationary asymmetric states ( emerging after the instability of the symmetric states ) , can not be identified .",
    "inevitably , the question of their fate arises .",
    "this type of question was initially raised in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where a leaky quantum dimer , with loss only , was considered ) and , past a critical point , states with a complex ( instead of real ) `` eigenvalue '' @xmath13 were identified . in the @xmath0-symmetric context , a similar idea was put forth in ref .",
    "@xcite for a double well consisting of two delta functions . in our paper",
    "we unify the approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite by computing the `` ghost states '' ( as we characterize them ) that emerge from the symmetry - breaking bifurcation .    before presenting the computation of the ghost states ,",
    "we comment that these states with complex ( nonlinear ) eigenvalue @xmath13 are no longer _ true _ solutions of the original system ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "this is because of the u@xmath54 invariance of the system , which only allows stationary solutions with real @xmath13 [ so that @xmath55 .",
    "when this symmetry is violated , the solutions may satisfy the stationary equations ( [ e6 ] ) , but are only ghost states of the original dynamical system because they do not satisfy ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "thus , at best one expects that the dynamics may stay close to the dynamics of these ghost states , especially during the evolution of the symmetry - breaking instability .",
    "we return to this topic later .",
    "to identify these stationary solutions , we introduce polar coordinates @xmath56 and get @xmath57 to derive the asymmetric ( @xmath21 ) solutions , we rewrite these equations as @xmath58 applying the identity @xmath59 to ( [ e11 ] ) , we obtain a condition for the solution amplitudes , and the same identity applied to ( [ e12 ] ) yields the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "these solutions exist _ only _ for @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath53 , they exist for all values of @xmath34 ( i.e. , they have bifurcated `` already '' due to the nonlinearity ) .",
    "also , these solutions terminate as @xmath61 , @xmath62 . in turn",
    ", this implies that in this limit both @xmath63 and @xmath64 vanish , with the ratio between them having the limit @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we have identified the disappearance point @xmath66 of these symmetry - broken solutions .",
    "finally , we discuss the disappearance of the two symmetric states at the critical point @xmath41 , which is the phase - transition point of the linear ( and nonlinear ) problem .",
    "we have shown that at this point the symmetry - broken states still exist , but that now they are only ghost states of the steady - state problem . from the point of view of nonlinear theory ,",
    "one may be content to find a saddle - center bifurcation at this point , which leads to the disappearance of these solutions as stationary states of the nonlinear problem . yet",
    ", once again , when these solutions disappear ( even in the normal form of such a bifurcation ) , this means that they appear somewhere else within the complex plane of solutions . in order to compare this result with the linear @xmath0-symmetric case ,",
    "where the eigenvalues collide , become complex , and continue to exist in the complex plane , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and consider the analytic continuation of our solutions . in the @xmath0-symmetric regime",
    "up to the critical point , the solutions are chosen so that @xmath67 .",
    "( this is a broader statement for a spatially distributed system ; in our simpler dimer setting , we need only replace @xmath68 by the subscript @xmath69 and @xmath70 by the subscript @xmath71 , or vice - versa . ) thus , to perform the analytic continuation , we use @xmath72 in ( [ e5 ] ) , which leads to ( [ e9])-([e10 ] ) , but in the first pair of equations @xmath73 and @xmath74 are replaced by @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the result is @xmath77 note that the pitchfork symmetry - breaking branches also tend to this solution , as shown above in the expression for @xmath78 in the limit of termination of the branch when @xmath66 .",
    "we have made an additional subtle assumption here , namely , that @xmath79 .",
    "we can obtain more general solutions without this assumption , but these do not appear to introduce new features to the problem .    the solutions stemming from the analytic continuation provide a complete description of the states of the system .",
    "we move from symmetric / antisymmetric states to asymmetric ones ( which may be ghost states ) through a pitchfork bifurcation , destabilizing the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) branch for a focusing ( defocusing ) nonlinearity .",
    "we terminate at the point of the linear @xmath0 phase transition , where the nonlinear eigenvalues of the symmetric branches collide and become complex , giving rise to an analytic continuation of our solutions in the complex plane .",
    "all solutions terminate at @xmath80 .",
    "the central problem of interest here is an nls equation with a double - well potential , @xmath81 where @xmath82 . here , @xmath83 is a complex field ( which can represent the electric field envelope in optics or the macroscopic wavefunction in becs ) ; @xmath84 is a linear schrdinger operator containing a real , symmetric double - well potential @xmath85 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; @xmath86 is a purely imaginary odd potential with @xmath87 .      in such settings",
    "two - mode approximations have been valuable tools for studying the statics , stability , and dynamics of the system ( see rigorous justifications in refs .",
    "however , we do not use a galerkin truncation to the ground and excited eigenmodes @xmath88 of the linear operator @xmath89 with eigenvalues @xmath90 , @xmath91 @xcite , but rather the rotated basis @xmath92 @xcite @xmath93 the subscripts @xmath94 and @xmath95 denote the left and right well of @xmath96 . note that @xmath97 and @xmath35 ( the ground- and first - excited state ) are even and odd functions of @xmath68 .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we approximate the solution of ( [ e15 ] ) by the galerkin expansion @xmath98 , where @xmath99 are unknown time - dependent coefficients . substituting this ansatz into ( [ e15 ] ) and subsequently projecting on @xmath100 , @xmath101",
    ", we obtain the following equations for @xmath99 : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "also , @xmath105 , and due to the parities of @xmath106 and @xmath107 it follows that @xmath108 . to derive the system above",
    "we have assumed , in addition to the truncation itself , that the overlap integrals @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 are negligible in comparison to @xmath112 and @xmath113 . this approximation becomes better as the distance between the wells becomes larger because these three integrals depend exponentially on the separation between the wells because of the exponential decay of the bound states @xmath114 .",
    "( comparisons of these terms with the dominant terms @xmath115 , @xmath116 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which attests to the validity of this approximation . ) note that , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , even the full model with these additional terms is analytically tractable .",
    "however , for our present purposes , this assumption considerably simplifies the analysis and helps to connect with the study of the @xmath0-symmetric dnls dimer .",
    "the equality @xmath117 mirrors the symmetric nature of @xmath118 , while @xmath119 , mirrors the antisymmetric nature of @xmath120 .",
    "we now consider solutions to ( [ e17 ] ) of the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 are unknown constant amplitudes and @xmath123 is the propagation constant ( chemical potential in becs ) .",
    "the prefactor @xmath124 is used to rescale the term in front of the nonlinearity . substituting this ansatz into ( [ e17 ] ) and using @xmath125 as the ( nonlinear ) eigenvalue",
    ", we find that @xmath122 satisfy precisely the stationary equations for the dnls @xmath0-symmetric dimer @xmath126 where we have used the notation @xmath127 .",
    "to further justify our assumptions regarding the overlap integrals , we note that for the hamiltonian case of @xmath42 , the symmetry breaking is predicted to occur at @xmath128 for the focusing nonlinearity case and at @xmath129 for the defocusing one .",
    "this implies a bifurcation at @xmath130 in the focusing case and at @xmath131 in the defocusing case .",
    "the corresponding predictions for the bifurcations induced by nonlinearity for ( [ e15 ] ) are @xmath132 for the focusing case , while the critical @xmath123 for the defocusing one is @xmath133 @xcite . in these expressions",
    "@xmath134 , @xmath135 , while @xmath136 .",
    "hence , it is clear that the approximation for the overlap integrals made above is tantamount to @xmath137 because in that case the two expressions ( the one from the dimer and the one from the exact two - mode reduction ) coincide , showing that this is a reasonable approximation and that it trades a simple prediction for the critical points , which can be quantified just by knowing the eigenvalues of the underlying linear problem , for a small loss of accuracy in the result .",
    "this is the approximation that we use for the full problem .",
    "having reduced ( [ e15 ] ) to the simple dimer model of ( [ e19 ] ) , we now use the results of sec .",
    "ii to study the bifurcations of our @xmath0-symmetric nls model . to make connections between our work with earlier papers on double - well potentials , we use the same form of the double - well potential that was used in refs .",
    "it should , however , be evident from the exposition above that our basic phenomenology and corresponding conclusions will be quite general .",
    "in particular , we consider a potential of the form @xmath138 , where @xmath139 the real ( even ) potential @xmath118 consists of a parabolic trap of strength @xmath140 and a localized barrier potential of strength @xmath141 and width @xmath142 , which has a standard double - well structure ( that is easily achievable , e.g. , in atomic becs ) .",
    "the imaginary potential @xmath120 of strength @xmath143 has a prototypical antisymmetric gain - loss profile @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we fix the parameters of @xmath96 to be @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , which yields the two lowest eigenvalues of the potential as @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this imposes a tunneling strength between the wells of @xmath149 .",
    "there are now two possible paths to follow , both of which yield the symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation , as indicated above .",
    "the first involves increasing the propagation constant @xmath123 ( and hence the dimer eigenvalue @xmath13 ) , thus increasing the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "the second involves increasing the @xmath0-symmetric potential parameter @xmath143 ( and hence the corresponding dimer parameter @xmath34 ) .",
    "both of these paths will yield the pitchfork bifurcation when @xmath150 if the nonlinearity is sufficiently weak ( namely , @xmath151 ) .",
    "however , only the latter path , which we follow below , exhibits the @xmath0-symmetry - breaking phase transition when @xmath152 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the bifurcation diagram @xmath153 , where @xmath154 represents the energy in optics ( number of atoms in becs ) . the figure compares the full pde model with the @xmath0-symmetric dimer model , where the real part of the chemical potential is chosen to be @xmath155 .",
    "this choice of @xmath123 is justified by the requirement to be sufficiently close to the linear eigenvalues so that the two - mode picture is valid . given the defocusing nature of the nonlinearity used , @xmath156 .",

    "it should nevertheless be recalled that this stability analysis is not of direct use as these states are _ not _ stationary , and the existence of positive @xmath158 leads to an amplitude that grows in time .",

    "the first initialization ( whose evolution is shown in the left panel of fig .  [ fig9 ] ) used the symmetric solution as obtained for a smaller value of @xmath34 , namely for @xmath163 , to examine the outcome of the `` standard '' waveforms past the @xmath0-phase - transition point which leads to the termination of their existence .",
    "this dynamics illustrated a phenomenology similar to that shown earlier in fig .",
    "the initial growth stage was finally succeeded by the formation of a robust dark soliton on the left well of the potential . a similar evolution shown in the right panel of the figure",
    "was observed for the case of the ghost state with @xmath164 .",
    "we also performed a similar computation initialized with the result of the analytic continuation and a similar integration result was obtained ( not shown ) .",
    "we conclude that past the critical point of the @xmath0 phase transition , the dynamics is typically attracted to dark soliton ghost states , which reside within the lossy well ( and can thus not be captured by our two - mode picture ) .",
    "in this paper we have used analytical and numerical methods to revisit the problem of a @xmath0-symmetric double - well potential .",
    "we used a particular form for the symmetric real part and the antisymmetric ( @xmath0-symmetric ) imaginary part of the potential , but we indicated that the specific choice of the potential is inconsequential .",
    "in fact , given the double - well structure and a suitable choice of parameters ( such as the chemical potential , i.e. , the strength of the nonlinearity ) , one can reduce the problem to a two - mode regime . in",
    "that setting a reduction can be made explicit ( and its assumptions / transformations can be suitably formulated ) from the original pde problem ( the nonlinear schrdinger model with a @xmath0-symmetric double - well potential ) to the simpler and analytically tractable dimer setting .    in the latter ,",
    "we have shown that all characteristics of the system become transparent and we have identified the symmetric and antisymmetric states and their nonlinear continuation .",
    "we have quantified the pitchfork bifurcation , formerly leading to asymmetric states due to nonlinearity , and presently leading to ghost states due to @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "we have explicitly obtained and monitored the daughter states of this bifurcation and their role in the dynamics , even though they are not exact solutions .",
    "we computed the @xmath0 phase transition ( or simply the saddle - center bifurcation ) of the two fundamental branches .",
    "finally , the analytic continuation of the system past this critical point , with its unusual `` nonlocal '' ( at least at the pde level ) cross talk of @xmath68 and @xmath70 was formulated . in all of the above ,",
    "the analytics performed in the framework of the two - mode approximation remain invariably a reasonable approximation to the full original system and the numerical computations therein .",
    "the above analysis gives a fundamental picture for the combined existence and interplay of nonlinearity , effective discreteness ( through the double - well potential ) and @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "however , there are numerous directions for interesting generalizations of this work",
    ". one of these would be to consider the more complicated `` oligomer '' configurations of ref .",
    "@xcite ; namely , the trimers and quadrimers ( for the latter , see also ref .",
    "@xcite and even the plaquette two - dimensonal building blocks of ref .",
    "another aspect that has emerged both here and in the context of ref .",
    "@xcite is to investigate the dynamics of the asymmetric states in which a dark soliton emerges and localizes within the lossy region .",
    "these are ghost states of the full pde model ; as we indicated , they can not be captured by the two - mode approximation .",
    "these ghost states deserve a systematic investigation and classification .",
    "generalizing to higher - dimensional settings , and introducing topologically charged states such as vortices  @xcite would also be worth exploring .",
