    "a significant fraction ( 5075% ) of seyfert - i active galactic nuclei ( agns ) exhibit absorption features due to highly ionized gas ( so called `` warm absorber '' - wa ) along the line - of - sight to the central source ( e.g. , george et al .",
    "early _ asca _ spectra showed only the strongest bound - free ovii and oviii edges , while the full complexity of the absorption spectrum are clearly evident in recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the x - ray grating spectrometers aboard these two observatories reveal narrow absorption lines from h - like and he - like ions as well as from lower ionization ions of all abundant elements from carbon to iron , and m - shell and l - shell absorption lines from iron ions .",
    "these narrow absorption lines were found in most of seyfert i agns observed so far ( e.g. , ngc5548 - steenbrugge et al .",
    "2003 ; ngc4051 - collinge et al .",
    "2001 ) . in most cases",
    "the absorption lines are blueshifted by about several hundred kms@xmath0 relative to the systemic velocity , indicating that the ionized absorbing gas is outflowing .",
    "the best example , so far , is the seyfert - i galaxy ngc3783 , which has the best observed x - ray spectrum in terms of spectral resolution and s / n . it was observed for 900 ks with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) on _ chandra _ ( kaspi et al . 2002 ; netzer et al .",
    "2003 ) and for about 280 ks with the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) on _ xmm - newton _",
    "( behar et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the spectrum shows more than 150 absorption lines from more than 30 ions spanning a wide range of ionization potentials . in order to model this spectrum netzer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) invoked a photoionization model which includes three ionized components , each split into two kinematic components ( at outflow velocities of 500 and 1000 kms@xmath0 ) .",
    "the three components span a large range of ionization and have total column density of about @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "all three components are thermally stable and seem to have the same gas pressure . due to the detailed study of this spectrum it can serve as a benchmark for the study of other high resolution x - ray spectra of agns .",
    "in contrast to the many studies of the high - resolution x - ray spectra of low - luminosity agns , there were only few such studies of high - luminosity agns  the quasars .",
    "studies by _ asca _",
    "( e.g. , george et al .",
    "2000 ) show that the fraction of these with strong was is below the equivalent fraction in low - luminosity agns .",
    "a plausible explanation can be that the wa in high - luminosity agns is much more ionized and thus escaped the detection by the low resolution of _ asca _ , which is only sensitive to the strong bound - free absorption by the ovii and oviii edges . to investigate this hypothesis we are studying the x - ray high resolution grating spectra of quasars from _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ in search for absorption lines . in this contribution we present some preliminary results for three of the quasars we are studying .",
    "mr2251 + 178 ( @xmath4 ) is the first quasar detected by x - ray observations . in figure 1",
    "we present the high - resolution grating spectrum obtained by the rgs on may 2002 .",
    "the spectrum shows emission lines from nvi , ovii , oviii , neix , and nex , as well as absorption lines from oiii , oiv , ov , ovi , neix and nex .",
    "several other absorption lines which we suspect their presence are marked in figure 1 .",
    "the spectrum has been corrected for galactic absorption .",
    "the strongest emission lines are due to the ovii triplet and oviii ly@xmath5 . other suggested emission and absorption lines",
    "are marked .",
    "gaps in the spectrum due to chip gaps are marked as ` art ' .",
    "the three absorbers model was convolved with the rgs instrumental resolution and was also binned to 0.04   .",
    "[ rgsspecmr ] , width=491 ]    in order to fit this high - resolution spectrum we first fitted the low resolution epic - pn data obtained in the same observation .",
    "the epic - pn data clearly show a power law with a photon index of @xmath6 at energies above 3 kev .",
    "extrapolating this power law to lower energies revels the presence of a wa around 0.8 kev , an additional absorber below 0.5 kev , and some excess emission around 0.5 kev .",
    "our best fitted model for these data yields a wa with a column density , @xmath7 , of @xmath8 @xmath3 , ionization parameter , @xmath9 , of @xmath10 and a line of sight covering factor of 0.8 . assuming gas with the same properties produces the emission , we find a global covering factor of 0.3 . for the less ionized absorber",
    "we find that it can be fitted with a neutral absorber ( in addition to the galactic one ) with @xmath11 @xmath3 .",
    "this absorber can also be modeled as a combination of low - ionization absorber with @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath3  and a neutral absorber of @xmath14 @xmath3 .",
    "both cases give equally good fits .",
    "modeling of the rgs spectrum was done in two steps .",
    "first we experimented with a two - components absorber similar to the one fitted to the epic - pn data described above , which involves a highly - ionized absorber and a second absorber of much lower - ionization .",
    "we experimented with a range of parameters around the values found for the epic - pn .",
    "the parameters we found to fit best for the two absorbers in the rgs spectrum are : log(@xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath3  for the high - ionization wa component and log(@xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath3  for the low - ionization component .",
    "the second step includes a three - components absorber .",
    "the main motivation for this is the fact that the rgs data around 1617    clearly falls below the two - components model .",
    "the excess absorption is probably caused by the unresolved transition array ( uta ) of iron m - shell lines which has been observed in several other agns ( see , e.g. , netzer et al .",
    "2003 for the case of ngc3783 ) .",
    "our photoionization code includes all these lines but the two - components wa produces too shallow a feature at too short a wavelength .",
    "we find that an additional shell with a column density of @xmath19 @xmath3and log@xmath20 can significantly improve the fit .",
    "this component produces a noticeable uta feature and contributes also to the observed ovii emission .",
    "this requires lowering the emission from the high - ionization component by about 20% to produce an adequate fit to all emission lines . adding this",
    "component force us to increase the ionization parameter of the highly ionized gas ( the one with column density of @xmath21 @xmath3 ) to log@xmath22 .",
    "we note that the mean @xmath9 of these two wa components is the same as the one found earlier in the two - components model .",
    "the three - components model is compared with the rgs data in figure 1 .",
    "pg1211 + 143 ( @xmath23 ) is a radio - quiet narrow emission line quasar .",
    "it was observed with _ xmm - newton _ for about 60 ks on june 2001 . using the epic - pn , epic - mos , and rgs data pounds et al .",
    "( 2003 ) identified absorption lines from h - like and he - like ions of fe , s , mg , ne , o , n , and c. they claimed the observed line energies indicate an ionized outflow velocity of @xmath24 kms@xmath0 .",
    "we obtained the data from the _ xmm - newton _ archive and present in figure 2 the rgs data .",
    "our preliminary re - analysis of the data shows that an ionized absorber with outflow velocity of about 3000 kms@xmath0 provides an alternative explanation to the data .",
    "we are able to identify at this velocity a series of absorption lines from h - like and he - like ions of mg , ne , and o , as well as l - shell lines from iron ions .",
    "we also include the emission seen from the ovii and neix forbidden lines , and the ly@xmath5 emission lines of oviii and nex .",
    "these emission lines together with the many l - shell iron lines were not taken into account in the model by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the spectrum has been corrected for galactic absorption .",
    "the model shown includes absorption lines blueshifted by 3000 kms@xmath0 and few emission lines . theoretical rest - frame wavelengths of h - like and he - like ions of n , o , ne , and mg are marked above the spectrum .",
