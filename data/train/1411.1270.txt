    "recent progress in experimental realization of quantum many - body systems have made quantum simulators very desirable .",
    "in particular , simulating the ground state of certain many - body systems are highly important for both condensed matter physics and quantum technology .",
    "cold atoms in optical lattices have been used for observing the quantum phase transition of superfluid to mott insulator @xcite .",
    "recent achievement of single site addressing @xcite made it possible to simulate spin wave @xcite and magnon propagation @xcite in one dimensional arrays of cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "while experimental achievements in optical lattices are very promising an analogues quantum simulator in solid state physics is at the edge of realization @xcite .",
    "there are two different physical setups in solid state physics which may be used as quantum simulators in a near future : ( i ) an array of gated quantum dots @xcite ; ( ii ) a chain of dopants , such as phosphorus , in silicon @xcite .",
    "although these systems may realize the same physical hamiltonians as cold atoms they have important differences as well .",
    "for instance , these systems are charged particle fermions which do not exist in cold atoms and unlike cold atom systems , which are almost disorder free , they are exposed to many different noises and disorders . in ref .  @xcite it has been shown that the hubbard hamiltonian can be realized in an array of quantum dots , each hosting a single electron .",
    "tuning the tunneling will then realize an effective spin chain model of such electron arrays .    theoretically , preparing a many - body system to its ground state",
    "can always be achieved by cooling the system to very low temperatures , namely , below their energy gap . however , for gapless systems the energy separation between the ground state and excited states becomes vanishingly small when the size of the system increases , hence demanding for very low temperatures which are not accessible in practice . to overcome this obstacle one can use the adiabatic theorem @xcite according to which a many - body system always remains in the ground state of its time varying hamiltonian if the time variation is slow enough .",
    "hence , one can prepare the system in the ground state of a gapped hamiltonian , which is practically achievable , and then changes the parameters of the system very slowly to reach the desired hamiltonian .",
    "if this time variation is faster than the thermalization time one can guarantee then the system goes to the ground state of the desired many - body hamiltonian .",
    "since the energy gap of a uniform heisenberg hamiltonian of length @xmath0 goes down like @xmath1 the anti - ferromagnetic ground state of such system is very hard to achieve .    in this paper",
    "we use the same scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , proposed for optical lattices , for preparing the many - body system into its ground state .",
    "according to that proposal a series of singlet pairs , initially prepared in an optical super - lattice with alternating zero coupling , are adiabatically driven to the ground state of the uniform heisenberg chain by switching on the couplings very slowly . in optical lattices ,",
    "the main imperfection issue is the particle loss which has been studied in @xcite .",
    "other imperfections have been analyzed in spin chain quantum communication . in @xcite",
    "the effect of static disorder has been investigated in an engineered xx model for perfect state transfer .",
    "the on - site energy fluctuations in spin chains have been considered in @xcite and it was shown that these fluctuations affect the transmission in a different way compared to the static disorders . the localization problem and how to overcome it under the presence of disordered couplings and local fields have been studied in @xcite    in the setup , considered here , i.e. solid state quantum dot arrays ( or equivalently dopant arrays ) , there are very different sources of imperfection .",
    "the first one is the exchange coupling disorder resulting from imperfect fabrication and voltage gate fluctuations .",
    "such disorders can originate from the initial fabrication process creating a random static profile for the exchange couplings or resulting from the time varying white noise in gate voltages .",
    "the second important disorder effect is the hyperfine interaction in which the electron spin interacts with the nearby nuclei spins of the bulk .",
    "we then study the effect of such disorders in the adiabatic ground state preparation of the heisenberg spin chain . in addition",
    ", we also introduce a mechanism for adiabatically transferring singlet - triplet states , as classical information , across such quantum chain in the same spirit of @xcite for spin qubits and of @xcite for charge qubits .",
    "the difference with the ground state preparation lies in the fact that the quantum state is no longer the ground state of the hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , we show that while the ground state preparation is highly robust against disorder , the singlet - triplet transfer is highly affected by such imperfections making the adiabatic strategy very inefficient for communication tasks .",
    "this justifies quantum quenches as the more efficient way for communication across spin chains .     for all",
    "even @xmath2 , initialized in a series of singlets evolves adiabatically to the anti - ferromagnetic ground state of a uniform chain in which all the couplings are identical , i.e. @xmath3 .",
    "( b ) a triplet ( or singlet ) state initially decoupled from the rest of the system is adiabatically transferred to the other side by switching on the coupling @xmath4 and switching off the coupling @xmath5 simultaneously.,width=302,height=226 ]",
    "we consider an even chain of @xmath0 spin-1/2 particles ( namely qubits ) interacting via the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vector of pauli operators , @xmath8 are the exchange couplings ( given in hz ) and @xmath9 is the planck constant .",
    "the goal of our procedure is to prepare the chain in the ground state of the uniform heisenberg model with @xmath3 for all @xmath2 .",
    "theoretically , this can be achieved by cooling the uniform heisenberg chain via interaction with a cold reservoir whose temperature is sufficiently smaller than the energy gap of the system . however , in practice that is notoriously difficult as the energy gap of the uniform chain goes down by increasing the length as @xmath1 and thus the needed temperatures for realizing the cooling task become unrealistic .",
    "so , to achieve that we exploit the adiabatic theorem and initialize the system into the ground state of another hamiltonian which is easier to reach and then slowly evolve the hamiltonian into the desired one ( here the uniform heisenberg chain ) . according to the adiabatic theorem if the evolution is slow enough the quantum state of the system follows the ground state manifold throughout the evolution and eventually the ground state of the desired hamiltonian is reached .",
    "of course , the protocol is successful only when the time needed for adiabatic evolution is less than the thermalization time .    to fulfill the above task , we assume that initially , at @xmath10 , we have @xmath3 for all odd @xmath2 and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "this forms a fully dimerized chain , schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , with alternating zero couplings .",
    "the ground state of such a chain is a tensor product of @xmath12 singlets as @xmath13 and is independent of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thanks to this large energy gap the initialization of the system in its ground state ( [ singlets ] ) is easy and can be achieved by cooling the system into fairly low temperatures , as has been done for both cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and electrons in double quantum dot systems @xcite .",
    "as time elapses , while @xmath3 is constant for odd @xmath2s , for even @xmath2s the exchange couplings are turned on adiabatically until they reach the value @xmath14 in a time @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the so called ` ramping time ' ) , i.e. @xmath17\\frac{j}{t } & & { \\rm for } \\ ; k\\ ; { \\rm even } \\end{array}\\right . , \\ ] ] with @xmath18 the step function .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath20 for fixed @xmath21 , i.e. the ground state of at time @xmath21 . in order to describe the evolution of the system we employ the adiabatic theorem in that for a small , compared to @xmath16 , time interval @xmath22 ( i.e. @xmath23 ) during which we can consider the hamiltonian as constant . , where @xmath24 is the energy gap of the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath25 .",

    "as it is evident from the figure , at the end of the evolution the fidelity @xmath43 is almost 1 .",
    "in fact , by increasing @xmath16 we can always improve the final fidelity , however , it is wise to choose a high threshold such as @xmath44 and find the minimal ramping time @xmath45 which is enough to achieve such that fidelity . as mentioned above ,",
    "according to the adiabatic theorem , the ramping time @xmath45 is determined by the energy gap @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) we plot @xmath37 , in the unites of @xmath38 , as a function of @xmath39 which shows an almost linear dependence .",

    "we also propose to use the adiabatic switching for sending quantum information across a quantum chain .",

    "[ fig3](a and b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) the ramping time @xmath40 needed for singlet - triplet state transfer is shown versus @xmath41 which clearly shows a linear dependence for larger chains .",
    "a simple comparison between the minimum ramping time @xmath40 for state transfer ( see fig .  [ fig3](c ) ) and the ground state preparation ( see fig .  [ fig2](c ) ) shows that the the adiabatic communication scheme is at least 3 times slower than the ground state preparation .",
    "this is due to the fact that these two evolutions happen in two different subspaces , namely the ground state preparation takes place in the ground state manifold while the communication mechanism takes place in the excited state subspace .",
    "the energy separation between the quantum state with one triplet pair and the relevant higher energy states is lower than the energy separation in the global singlet subspace , needed for ground state preparation .",
    "this indeed shows itself in the larger time scales needed for accomplishing these two different tasks .",
    "finally , it is worth saying that any superposition of singlet and triplet can be perfectly transmitted .",
    "however , due to the fact that triplet and singlet have different energies they get a relative phase in time , even when the dynamics has not yet started , which has to be taken to account .",
    "this is equivalent to a deterministic rotation around the @xmath64-axis in the bloch sphere of the qubit which has to be considered before any further computational operations . as result",
    "the fidelity , achieved by the adiabatic evolution , becomes oscillatory and reaches one on its maxima .",
    "as an example we consider an equally weighted superposition @xmath65 and show the corresponding fidelity versus time in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) in which the oscillations in fidelity continues even when the adiabatic ramping is finished .",
    "the above procedures are of course very ideal and in realistic scenarios one may expect to have disorder in the hamiltonian which deteriorates the quality of the protocol . in this section",

    "@xcite each loaded with single electrons one can control the exchange interaction using electric gate voltages @xcite .",
    "however , the imperfect fabrications and the inevitable gate voltage fluctuations will introduce disorder in the exchange couplings .",
    "the induced disorder can be classified in to two different categories : ( i ) static disorder mainly because of imperfect fabrications and possible impurities in the system and ; ( ii ) time varying fluctuations resulting from voltage fluctuations of the gates .",
    "we assume that the disorders emerging on each coupling is independent of the others and can be simulated as @xcite @xmath66 with @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a random number with uniform distribution in the interval @xmath69 $ ] , for some constant number @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the white noise with the frequency spectrum @xmath72 ( @xmath70 and @xmath72 are dimensionless quantities ) .",
    "the phenomenological fit in eq .",
    "( [ j_random ] ) can faithfully explain the coupling fluctuations in gaas singlet - triplet qubit experiments @xcite .",
    "in practice , due to the strong cross - capacitive couplings between electrostatic gates in arrays of dots the coupling fluctuations between different pairs of electrons might be correlated .",
    "however , the most destructive scenario is the independent fluctuations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ j_random ] ) as , for instance , the perfect correlation between all exchange coupling fluctuations implies that @xmath73 becomes independent of site @xmath2 and all couplings fluctuate in the same way .",
    "this simply means that all the energy levels fluctuate together and its impact will be an irrelevant global phase with no destructive effect at all . on the other hand , independent fluctuations , considered in eq .",
    "( [ j_random ] ) maximizes the relative energy fluctuations between any pair of energy levels and thus makes the worst scenario which we consider in this paper .      for electron spins in quantum dots ,",

    ". actually we plot @xmath102 versus white noise strength @xmath72 for different values of static noise power @xmath70 and hyperfine interaction @xmath86 . in comparison to the ground state preparation",
    "the communication fidelity is very susceptible to disorder for triplet state transfer as for instance for @xmath91 and @xmath103 the fidelity goes down to @xmath104 .",
    "in contrast , the communication fidelity for singlet state transfer is quite robust even in the presence of strong disorder the fidelity does not go below @xmath105 .",
    "this is due to the different dimension of the triplet and singlet subspaces where the evolution is taking place .",
    "furthermore , one can see that the white noise fluctuation has less effect on @xmath102 in comparison to the static noise and hyperfine interaction .",
    "this is due to the fact that the time varying fluctuations cancel each other over time and thus create less effect on the performance of the system .",
    "the most destructive effect of all disorders can be seen for hyperfine interaction since even in the absence of all other noises ( i.e. @xmath106 ) the hyperfine noise of @xmath91 gives a very low fidelity of @xmath107 .",
    "this is because the random magnetic field generated by the nuclei spins have random direction and thus change the total magnetization of the system during the evolution while the exchange coupling disorder preserves the total magnetization of the system .",
    "finally , we can say that the noise has a destructive impact as soon as we go outside the singlet subspace , in fact already in a superposition like @xmath65 the noise causes the fidelity falling down to quite small values ( see figs .",

    "needed for our adiabatic processes increases as @xmath41 .",
    "the main limiting factors for the number of electrons are the coherence time of the system which is determined by the hyperfine interaction and the thermalization induced by the finite temperature of the dilution fridges .",

    "this can be significantly improved to @xmath117 @xmath118s using spin echo pulses @xcite .",
    "taking a pessimistic coherence time of @xmath114 ns and an exchange coupling of @xmath119 ghz shows that our protocol for ground state preparation can be still effective for chains up to length @xmath120 .",
    "determining the thermalization time due to the finite temperature ( @xmath115 mk ) of the dilution fridges is more tricky as unlike the coherence time there is not much experimental data . according to fig .",

    "this means that simple cooling can not cool the system into its ground state and indeed that is why we proposed our adiabatic evolution mechanism for preparation of the ground state . to see up to what time scales the system can still faithfully stays in its ground state after a adiabatic evolution needs more experimental investigations as at this stage",

    "in summary , we have considered the effect of two inevitable types of disorder , namely hyperfine interaction and exchange coupling fluctuation , in quantum dot arrays for adiabatically preparation of ground state and singlet - triplet state transfer .",
    "the ground state preparation , performed in the ground state manifold of the hamiltonian during the time evolution , is accomplished in much faster time scales in comparison to the singlet - triplet communication which is operated on the excited state subspace . moreover",
