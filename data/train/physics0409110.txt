    "detectors for hep experiment must usually be operated remotely for safety reasons because of intensive radiation , high voltage or strong magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , precise tracking elements are typically surrounded by other detector components , making access difficult . for practical hep application of fsi , optical fibers for light delivery and return",
    "are therefore necessary .",
    "we constructed a fsi demonstration system by employing a pair of single - mode optical fibers of approximately 1 meter length each , one for transporting the laser beam to the beam splitter and retroreflector and another for receiving return beams .",
    "a key issue for the optical fiber fsi is that the intensity of the return beams received by the optical fiber is very weak ; the natural geometrical efficiency is @xmath2 for a measurement distance of 0.5 meter . in our design",
    ", we use a gradient index lens ( grin lens ) to collimate the output beam from the optical fiber .",
    "we believe our work represents a significant advancement in the field of fsi in that high - precision adm s and vibration measurements are performed ( without a _ priori _ knowledge of vibration strengths and frequencies ) , using a tunable laser , an isolator , an off - the - shelf f - p , a fiber coupler , two single - mode optical fibers , an interferometer and novel fringe analysis and vibration extraction techniques .",
    "two new multiple - distance - measurement analysis techniques are presented , to improve precision and to extract the amplitude and frequency of vibrations .",
    "expected dispersion effects when a corner cube prism or a beamsplitter substrate lies in the interferometer beam path are confirmed , and observed results agree well with results from numerical simulation .",
    "when present , the dispersion effect has a significant impact on the absolute distance measurement .",
    "the limitations of our current fsi system are also discussed in the paper , and major uncertainties are estimated .",
    "the intensity @xmath3 of any two - beam interferometer can be expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the intensities of the two combined beams , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the phases . assuming the optical path lengths of the two beams are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the phase difference in eq .",

    "the apparatus is supported on a damped newport optical table .    in order to reduce air flow and temperature fluctuations ,",
    "a transparent plastic box was constructed on top of the optical table .",
    "pvc pipes were installed to shield the volume of air surrounding the laser beam . inside the pvc pipes ,",
    "the typical standard deviation of 20 temperature measurements was about @xmath20 .",
    "temperature fluctuations were suppressed by a factor of approximately 100 by employing the plastic box and pvc pipes .",
    "the beam intensity coupled into the return optical fiber is very weak , requiring ultra - sensitive photodetectors for detection . considering the limited laser beam intensity and the need to split into many beams to serve a set of interferometers , it is vital to increase the geometrical efficiency . to this end",
    ", a collimator is built by placing an optical fiber in a ferrule ( 1 mm diameter ) and gluing one end of the optical fiber to a grin lens .",
    "the grin lens is a 0.25 pitch lens with 0.46 numerical aperture , 1 mm diameter and 2.58 mm length which is optimized for a wavelength of 630 nm .",
    "the density of the outgoing beam from the optical fiber is increased by a factor of approximately 1000 by using a grin lens .",
    "the return beams are received by another optical fiber and amplified by a si femtowatt photoreceiver with a gain of @xmath21 .",

    ", the vibration effects can be greatly suppressed .",
    "of course , statistical uncertainties from fringe and frequency determination , dominant in our current system , can also be reduced with multiple scans .",
    "averaging multiple measurements in one scan , however , provides similar precision improvement as averaging distance measurements from independent scans , and is faster , more efficient , and less susceptible to systematic errors from drift . in this way",

    "this multiple - distance - measurement technique is called slip measurement window with fixed size , shown in fig.2 .",
    "however , there is a trade off in that the thermal drift error is increased with the increase of @xmath39 because of the larger magnification factor @xmath40 for a smaller measurement window size .    in order to extract the amplitude and frequency of the vibration , another multiple - distance - measurement technique called slip measurement window with fixed start point",
    "is shown in fig.2 . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , if @xmath29 is fixed , the measurement window size is enlarged one f - p peak for each shift , an oscillation of a set of measured @xmath38 values reflects the amplitude and frequency of vibration .",
    "this technique is not suitable for distance measurement because there always exists an initial bias term including @xmath29 which can not be determined accurately in our current system .",
    "the typical measurement residual versus the distance measurement number in one scan using the above technique is shown in fig.3(a ) , where the scanning rate was 0.5 nm / s and the sampling rate was 125 ks / s .",

    "it can be seen that the distance errors decrease with an increase of @xmath39 .",
    "the rms of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is 1.6 @xmath1 if there is only one distance measurement per scan ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "if @xmath42 and the average value of 1200 distance measurements in each scan is considered as the final measured distance of the scan , the rms of the final measured distances for 10 scans is 41 nm for the distance of 449828.965 @xmath1 , the relative distance measurement precision is 91 ppb .",
    "some typical measurement residuals are plotted versus the number of distance measurements in one scan(@xmath39 ) for open box and closed box data with scanning rates of 2 nm / s and 0.5 nm / s in fig.4(a , b , c , d ) , respectively .",
    "the measured distance is approximately 10.4 cm .",
    "it can be seen that the slow fluctuations of multiple distance measurements for open box data are larger than that for closed box data .",
    "the standard deviation ( rms ) of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is approximately 1.5 @xmath1 if there is only one distance measurement per scan for closed box data . by using multiple - distance - measurement technique ,",
    "the distance measurement precisions for various closed box data with distances ranging from 10 cm to 70 cm collected in the past year are improved significantly , precisions of approximately 50 nanometers are demonstrated under laboratory conditions , as shown in table 1 .",
    "all measured precisions listed in the table 1 .",
    "are the rms of measured distances for 10 sequential scans .",
    "two fsi demonstration systems , air fsi and optical fiber fsi , are constructed for extensive tests of multiple - distance - measurement technique , air fsi means fsi with the laser beam transported entirely in the ambient atmosphere , optical fiber fsi represents fsi with the laser beam delivered to the interferometer and received back by single - mode optical fibers .",
    ".distance measurement precisions for various setups using the multiple - distance - measurement technique .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     based on our studies , the slow fluctuations are reduced to a negligible level by using the plastic box and pvc pipes to suppress temperature fluctuations .",
    "the dominant error comes from the uncertainties of the interference fringes number determination ; the fringes uncertainties are uncorrelated for multiple distance measurements . in this case",
    ", averaging multiple distance measurements in one scan provides a similar precision improvement to averaging distance measurements from multiple independent scans , but is faster , more efficient and less susceptible to systematic errors from drift .",
    "but , for open box data , the slow fluctuations are dominant , on the order of few microns in our laboratory .",
    "the measurement precisions for single and multiple distance open - box measurements are comparable , which indicates that the slow fluctuations can not be adequately suppressed by using the multiple - distance - measurement technique .",
    "a dual - laser fsi system@xcite intended to cancel the drift error is currently under study in our laboratory ( to be described in a subsequent article ) .    from fig.4(d ) , we observe periodic oscillation of the distance measurement residuals in one scan , the fitted frequency is @xmath43 hz for the scan .",
    "the frequency depends on the scanning rate , @xmath44 . from eq.(4 ) , it is clear that the amplitude of the vibration or oscillation pattern for multiple distance measurements depends on @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath26 , @xmath27 are constant values , it depends on the size of the distance measurement window .",
    "subsequent investigation with a ccd camera trained on the laser output revealed that the apparent @xmath03 hz vibration during the 0.5 nm / s scan arose from the beam s centroid motion . because the centroid motion is highly reproducible ,",
    "we believe that the effect comes from motion of the internal hinged mirror in the laser used to scan its frequency .",
    "the measurable distance range is limited in our current optical fiber fsi demonstration system for several reasons . for a given scanning rate of 0.25 nm / s ,",
    "the produced interference fringes , estimated by @xmath46 , are approximately 26400 in a 40-second scan for a measured distance ( @xmath47 ) of 60 cm , that is @xmath48 fringes / s , where @xmath23 is the scanned frequency and @xmath49 is the speed of light .",
    "the currently used femtowatt photoreceiver has 3 db frequency bandwidth ranging from 30 - 750 hz , the transimpedance gain decreases quickly beyond 750 hz .",
    "there are two ways to extend the measurable distance range .",
    "one straightforward way is to extend the effective frequency bandwidth of the femtowatt photoreceiver ; the other way is to decrease the interference fringe rate by decreasing the laser scanning rate .",
    "there are two major drawbacks for the second way ;",
    "one is that larger slow fluctuations occur during longer scanning times ; the other is that the laser scanning is not stable enough to produce reliable interference fringes if the scanning rate is lower than 0.25 nm / s for our present tunable laser .",
    "in addition , another limitation to distance range is that the intensity of the return beam from the retroreflector decreases inverse - quadratically with range .",
    "in order to test the vibration measurement technique , a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) was employed to produce vibrations of the retroreflector . for instance , the frequency of the controlled vibration source was set to @xmath50 hz with amplitude of @xmath51 . for @xmath52 distance measurements in one scan ,",
    "the magnification factor for each distance measurement depends on the scanned frequency of the measurement window , @xmath53 , where , @xmath12 is the average frequency of the laser beam in the measurement window , scanned frequency @xmath54 ghz , where i runs from 1 to @xmath39 , shown in fig.5(a ) .",
    "the distance measurement residuals for 2000 distance measurements in the scan are shown in fig.5(b ) , the oscillation of the measurement residuals reflect the vibration of the retroreflector .",
    "since the vibration is magnified by a factor of @xmath55 for each distance measurement , the corrected measurement residuals are measurement residuals divided by the corresponding magnification factors , shown in fig.5(c ) . the extracted vibration frequencies and amplitudes using this technique are @xmath56  hz , @xmath57 , respectively , in good agreement with expectations .",
    "another demonstration was made for the same vibration frequency , but with an amplitude of only @xmath58 nanometers .",
    "the magnification factors , distance measurement residuals and corrected measurement residuals for 2000 measurements in one scan are shown in fig.6(a ) , fig.6(b ) and fig.6(c ) , respectively .",
    "the extracted vibration frequencies and amplitudes using this technique are @xmath59  hz , @xmath60 nanometers .",
    "in addition , vibration frequencies at 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 hz with controlled vibration amplitudes ranging from 9.5 nanometers to 400 nanometers were studied extensively using our current fsi system .",
    "the measured vibrations and expected vibrations all agree well within the 10 - 15% level for amplitudes , 1 - 2% for frequencies , where we are limited by uncertainties in the expectations .",
    "vibration frequencies far below 0.1 hz can be regarded as slow fluctuations , which can not be suppressed by the above analysis techniques .    for comparison ,",
    "nanometer vibration measurement by a self - aligned optical feedback vibrometry technique has been reported@xcite .",
    "the vibrometry technique is able to measure vibration frequencies ranging from 20 hz to 20 khz with minimal measurable vibration amplitude of 1 nm . our second multiple - distance - measurement technique demonstrated above has capability to measure vibration frequencies ranging from 0.1 hz to 100 hz with minimal amplitude on the level of several nanometers , without a _ priori _ knowledge of the vibration strengths or frequencies .",
    "dispersive elements such as a beamsplitter , corner cube prism , etc . in the interferometer can create an apparent offset in measured distance for an fsi system , since the optical path length of the dispersive element changes during the scan . the small opd change caused by dispersion",
    "is magnified by a factor of @xmath40 and has a significant effect on the absolute distance measurement for the fsi system . the measured optical path difference @xmath32",
    "may be expressed as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 refer to the opd at times t and t0 , respectively , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the wavelength of the laser beam at times t and t0 , c is the speed of light , d1 and d2 are true geometrical distances in the air and in the corner cube prism , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the refractive index of ambient atmosphere and the refractive index of the corner cube prism for @xmath64 , respectively . the measured distance @xmath36 , where @xmath35 is the average refractive index around the optical path .",
    "the sellmeier formula for dispersion in crown glass ( bk7)@xcite can be written as , @xmath68 where , the beam wavelength @xmath69 is in unit of microns , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "if we use the first multiple - distance - measurement technique described above to make 2000 distance measurements for one typical scan , where the corner cube prism is used as retroreflector , we observe a highly reproducible drift in measured distance , as shown in fig.7 , where the fitted distance drift is @xmath76 microns for one typical scan using a straight line fit .",
    "however , there is no apparent drift if we replace the corner cube prism by the hollow retroreflector .",
    "numerical simulations have been carried out using eq.(5 ) and eq.(6 ) to understand the above phenomena .",
    "for instance , consider the case d1 = 20.97 cm and d2 = 1.86 cm ( the uncertainty of d2 is 0.06 cm ) , where the first and the last measured distances among 2000 sequential distance measurements are denoted @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . using the sellmeier equation ( eq.(6 ) ) for modeling the corner cube prism material ( bk7 ) dispersion , we expect @xmath79 = 373.876 microns and @xmath80 = 367.707 microns .",
    "the difference between @xmath77 and @xmath78 is @xmath81 microns which agrees well with our observed @xmath76 microns drift over 2000 measured distances .",
    "the measured distance shift and drift strongly depend on d2 , but are insensitive to d1 .",
    "a change of 1 cm in d1 leads to a 3-nanometer distance shift , but the same change in d2 leads to a 200-micron distance shift . if a beamsplitter is oriented with its reflecting side facing the laser beam , then there is an additional dispersive distance shift .",
    "we have verified this effect with 1-mm and a 5-mm beam splitters .",
    "when we insert an additional beamsplitter with 1 mm thickness between the retroreflector and the original beamsplitter in the optical fiber fsi system , we observe a 500 microns shift on measured distance if @xmath35 is fixed consistent with the numerical simulation result . for the 5-mm beam splitter ( the measured thickness of the beam splitter",
    "is @xmath82 mm ) , the first 20 scans were performed with the beamsplitter s anti - reflecting surface facing the optical fibers and the second 20 scans with the reflecting surface facing the optical fibers .",
    "the expected drifts ( @xmath83 ) for the first and the second 20 scans from the dispersion effect are 0 and @xmath84 microns , respectively .",
    "the measured drifts by averaging measurements from 20 sequential scans are @xmath85 microns and @xmath86 microns , respectively .",
    "the measured values agree well with expectations .",
    "in addition , the dispersion effect from air@xcite is also estimated by using numerical simulation .",
    "the expected drift ( @xmath83 ) from air dispersion is approximately -0.07 microns for an optical path of 50 cm in air , this effect can not be detected for our current fsi system .",
    "however , it could be verified by using a fsi with a vacuum tube surrounding the laser beam ; the measured distance with air in the tube would be approximately 4 microns larger than for an evacuated tube .    in summary , dispersion effects can have a significant impact on absolute distance measurements , but can be minimized with care for elements placed in the interferometer or corrected for , once any necessary dispersive elements in the interferometer are understood .",
    "some major error sources are estimated in the following ;    \\1 ) error from uncertainties of fringe and scanned frequency determination .",
    "the measurement precision of the distance @xmath87 ( the error due to the air s refractive index uncertainty is considered separately below ) is given by @xmath88 . where @xmath87 , @xmath13 , @xmath23 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 are measurement distance , fringe numbers , scanned frequency and their corresponding errors . for a typical scanning rate of 0.5 nm / s with a 10 nm scan range , the full scan time is 20 seconds .",
    "the total number of samples for one scan is 2.5 ms at a sampling rate of 125 ks / s .",
    "there is about a 4@xmath05 sample ambiguity in fringe peak and valley position due to a vanishing slope and the limitation of the 12-bit sampling precision .",
    "however , there is a much smaller uncertainty for the f - p peaks because of their sharpness .",
    "thus , the estimated uncertainty is @xmath92 for one full scan for a magnification factor @xmath93 .",

    "a room temperature of 21 @xmath101 , an air temperature change of @xmath102 will result in a 0.9 ppm change of air refractive index .",
    "for a temperature variation of @xmath20 in the pipe , @xmath94 distance measurements , the estimated error will be @xmath103 , where the magnification factor @xmath104 .",
    "the total error from the above sources , when added in quadrature , is @xmath105 , with the major error sources arising from the uncertainty of fringe determination and the thermal drift .",
    "the estimated relative error agrees well with measured relative spreads of @xmath106 in real data for measured distance of about 0.45 meters .    besides the above error sources",
    ", other sources can contribute to systematic bias in the absolute differential distance measurement .",
    "the major systematic bias comes from the uncertainty in the fsr of the f - p used to determine the scanned frequency range .",

    "a wavemeter of this precision was not available for the measurements described here .",
    "the systematic bias from the multiple - distance - measurement technique was also estimated by changing the starting point of the measurement window , the window size and the number of measurements , the uncertainties typically range from 10 to 50 nanometers . systematic bias from uncertainties in temperature , air humidity and barometric pressure scales",
