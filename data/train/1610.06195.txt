    "the issue of high episodic concentrations of air pollutants ( e.g.nitrogen oxides , particulates , carbon monoxides , etc . ) is a matter of growing worldwide concern due to their harmful effects on human health and the environment .",
    "amongst many contributing factors , road traffic emission is accounted for high proportions of harmful pollutants .",
    "accurate prediction of pollution episodes , including their magnitude and duration , is a formidable problem due to the combination of many complex physical and chemical processes involved in their formations .",
    "hence , there is a need for the development of sophisticated extreme value models in order to facilitate prediction of high pollution concentrations and to understand better their cause",
    ".    statistical analysis of air pollution data has been extensively advanced in recent decades ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in general , research in this area",
    "aims to pursue the following long - term goals @xcite , @xcite :    * predicting critical levels of pollutants to give out health warnings to public ; * identifying and predicting trends in high concentration levels ; * assessing changes in air pollution levels due to the impact of human activities on the environment , either direct ( e.g.  via changing emission patterns ) or indirect ( through the climate change ) .    as argued by eastoe & tawn @xcite , statistical methodology based on extreme value theory",
    "is particularly suited to address these problems .",
    "an extensive discussion of extreme value methods useful in the air quality modelling can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the present paper , a novel approach to extreme value modelling",
    "is proposed , tailored to problems indicated above both on long - term ( e.g.  daily or yearly ) and short - term ( e.g.  15-min ) time - scales .",
    "the latter is particularly important in environmental and health applications due to the fact that even a short exposure to high pollution concentrations may have harmful effects on human health ( e.g. , asthmatic patients exposed to a high @xmath3 concentration may develop adverse symptoms within minutes  @xcite ) .",
    "the models presented in this paper are used to analyse the nitrogen oxide @xmath0 , nitrogen dioxide @xmath1 ( commonly referred to as @xmath4 ) and ozone @xmath2 concentration data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : time_series_concentration ] ) , which consist of 15-min maxima of one - minute concentration values observed within one calendar year ( from 1 jan 2008 to 1 jan 2009 ) .",
    "the data were collected at a fixed roadside laboratory on kirkstall road in the city of leeds , uk .",
    "the laboratory houses a traffic monitoring system and an air quality monitoring station , in which local meteorological conditions are also monitored ( see more details in sect .",
    "[ subsec : covariates ] below ) .     and @xmath2 ( expressed in ppb = parts - per - billion ) , collected at the kirkstall roadside laboratory from 1 jan 2008 till 1 jan 2009 .",

    "the 90%-quantiles of the concentration values are indicated by the dashed lines.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : time_series_concentration ] , all three chemicals have a highly variable dynamic behaviour , with noticeable evidence of non - stationarity .",
    "temporal variation in the mean and variance , as well as in the patterns of extreme values , can be explained by the underlying physical and chemical processes .",
    "an additional remarkable feature of these plots is that the chemicals are apparently strongly correlated .",
    "the dependence can be attributed to the photochemical inter - conversion reactions between the pollutants @xcite . despite a large number of chemical processes potentially oxidizing @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the most important source of secondary @xmath1 is the following reaction : @xmath5 due to asymmetry of the reactions , the equilibrium concentration levels ( photostationary state ) strongly depend on the presence ( or otherwise ) of sunlight ( @xmath6 ) , in particular leading to decreased levels of @xmath4 ( and , correspondingly , increased levels of ozone @xmath2 ) during the summer due to a higher solar radiation .",
    "hence , there are yearly cycles in the time series of concentrations .",
    "there is also a difference between daylight and night - time measurements that can be explained by the lack of sunshine at night and dry deposition in the early morning .",
    "in addition to , the emission of @xmath4 also follows some daily , weekly and seasonal trends , which are due to the traffic patterns ( including peak hours and weekday - weekend oscillations ) and to the seasonal variability of human activities , such as emission from plants and motor vehicles , combustion of fossil fuels in habitations , etc . specifically , the data under study correspond to traffic - dominated emission sources .    in the present work ,",
    "extreme value models are developed furnishing an efficient tool to estimate the probabilities of future extreme events , conditional on the traffic and meteorological covariates .",
    "in particular , these models account for non - stationarity of pollution concentrations ; thus , the effects of possible future scenarios relating to changes in emission patterns and climate can also be quantified .",
    "the models are semi - parametric , in that the covariates are included via the usual log - linear regression setting , whereas the prior distribution of the covariates is unspecified .",
    "even though the three pollutants under study appear to be highly correlated , we confine ourselves to univariate models for each chemical , which however prove to be rather efficient .",
    "furthermore , these models may serve as a stepping stone for a multivariate version of the pot modelling ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which will be developed in forthcoming work .",
    "it would also be important to add a spatial ( e.g.regional ) dimension to the models ; to this end , data available from the uk s largest database known as the automatic urban and rural network ( aurn ) @xcite will be instrumental ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "suppose that observations @xmath7 are independent , identically distributed ( _ i.i.d .",
    "_ ) random variables with a common continuous distribution function , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "there are two main approaches in the literature to characterization of extreme values in the sequence @xmath10 ( see smith  @xcite for a review and further bibliography therein ) .",
    "the classic _ block - maxima _ method based on the fisher  tippett  gnedenko theorem ( see @xcite ) proceeds by picking the maximum values over certain blocks of data , say of large enough size @xmath11 each , and approximating them via a _ generalized extreme value ( gev ) _ distribution function representing the probability of not exceeding a given threshold @xmath9 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the _ location _ , _ scale _ and _ shape _ parameters , respectively .",
    "three distinct subclasses of the gev distributions are known as the frchet ( @xmath17 , weibull ( @xmath18 ) , and gumbel ( @xmath19 ) distributions ; the latter is interpreted as the limit of as @xmath20 , leading to the double - exponential expression @xmath21    a more recent _ peaks - over - threshold ( pot ) _ method ( see @xcite ) focuses on exceedances within the original i.i.d .",
    "sample over a `` high '' threshold @xmath22 , i.e.@xmath23 conditioned on the event @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding approximation is known as the _ generalized pareto distribution ( gpd ) _ ,",
    "@xmath25 with the same shape parameter @xmath16 as in ( hence , not depending on the threshold value  @xmath22 ) and a new scale parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the gpd approximation holds whenever the gev approximation is in place @xcite . for @xmath19 , takes the ( limiting ) form @xmath27    since the air quality standards and objectives are normally expressed in terms of certain critical thresholds , the pot approach is apparently more suitable and better interpretable in the air pollution context .",
    "moreover , there is a growing recognition among statisticians and environmental modellers that the pot is superior to the block - maxima approach in that the latter ignores any secondary extreme values in each block ( i.e.  next to the maximum one ) and thus leads to loss of information ; consequently , the pot has a strong potential to provide an improved accuracy of estimation and inference @xcite .",
    "davison & smith @xcite proposed an extension of the pot method to a non - stationary case by treating the parameters of the gpd as functions of covariates . in the present paper , our goal is to build a dynamic version of the davison ",
    "smith model ( referred to as _ model  i _ ) and to express the distribution of extreme concentration values ( threshold exceedances ) in terms of the traffic and meteorological conditions .",
    "this way , the impact of these factors on the extreme values can be assessed and , moreover , appropriate combinations of the covariates can be identified which determine persistent dependence between the extremes of different pollutants .",
    "furthermore , to resolve the intrinsic problem of threshold stability of gpd in the non - stationary case ( pointed out in @xcite ) , we propose a special functional form ( _ model  ii _ ) for the parameters of the gpd that ensures consistency of the model over different threshold choices . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", such a solution is new .    due to analytical and computational complexities , estimation of the model parameters and variable selection",
    "were carried out within the bayesian framework by using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) procedure .",
    "recall that mcmc is a simulation technique based on running a suitable markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is the desired ( posterior ) distribution of the model parameters ( see gilks et al .",
    "in addition to computational convenience and efficiency , this techniques provides more information as compared to the conventional maximum likelihood inference ; for instance , it makes it possible to find the predictive distribution for future extreme events @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the methodology based on an extension of the davison ",
    "smith model is set out in sect .",
    "[ sec : methodology ] .",
    "the results of the model fitting are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : result ] along with the estimation of extreme events .",
    "this is followed in sect .",
    "[ sec : tsummary ] by a discussion of the inference obtained .",
    "motivated by davison & smith @xcite , a similar model ( model  i ) is applied in this section to the data .",
    "furthermore , a new functional form for the parameters is proposed , which ensures consistency over different threshold choices , thus resolving the problem of threshold stability ( model  ii ) .",
    "the performance of both models on the same data is then compared .",
    "let us introduce the necessary notation and describe the models in more detail .",
    "let @xmath10 be a ( discrete - time ) random process representing the temporal dynamics of the concentration level of a specific pollutant , and let @xmath22 be a desired threshold level .",
    "if the observed values @xmath28 are i.i.d .",
    "and a gev approximation holds , then the ( conditional ) distribution function of the threshold exceedances @xmath29 can be approximated by the gpd ( see ) .",
    "clearly , the rate ( probability ) of a threshold exceedance is given by @xmath30 .    here and throughout the paper , we assume that the shape parameter @xmath16 does not depend on the threshold value @xmath22 ( see a comment after formula  ) .",
    "following @xcite , non - stationarity of the threshold exceedances is incorporated in model  i through the conditional distribution @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the random vector ( say , @xmath33-dimensional ) of relevant covariates such as traffic and meteorological conditions . for simplicity , we assume that these distributions do not depend on time  @xmath34 . thus , dependence amongst extreme concentration values arises solely through the covariates .",
    "full details of the covariates used throughout the model building are described in sect .",
    "[ subsec : covariates ] .    in turn , the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath16 used in the gpd model become certain functions of the covariate vector @xmath32 .",
    "likewise , the rate of threshold exceedance at time @xmath34 is modelled via a covariate - dependent parameter @xmath36 . as a result , the gpd approximation takes the form @xmath37 hence , the probability that @xmath38 conditioned on the covariates is equal to @xmath39    let us now introduce the following standard assumption ( cf.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) for the functional link between the model parameters and the covariates .",
    "we use the standard notation @xmath40 for @xmath41 .    for any threshold @xmath22 ,",
    "the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 are linear functions of the covariates , @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the transpose of a ( column-)vector @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the corresponding ( @xmath33-dimensional ) vector coefficients",
    ".    if the interest is in the behaviour of the exceedance @xmath51 alone , one can `` integrate out ''",
    "the covariates ( see @xcite ) , leading to the following formula @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the distribution density of the covariate vector @xmath32 . in practice ,",
    "the density @xmath53 is not known but it can be estimated by its empirical version using a subset of observation times where the covariate vector takes the values close to a given @xmath54 .",
    "an important desirable property of the gpd is its consistency with regard to the variable choice of the threshold , referred to as the _ threshold stability _ :",
    "if the conditional distribution of exceedances over @xmath22 is a gpd with parameters @xmath55 , then the conditional distribution of exceedances over @xmath56 is also given by a gpd with the same shape parameter @xmath16 and the new scale parameter @xmath57 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "as pointed out by eastoe & tawn @xcite , the davison  smith model in general does not guarantee the threshold stability .",
    "in fact , to ensure this property in the non - stationary case , the scale parameter must satisfy the condition @xcite @xmath58 for all @xmath59 and any @xmath60 .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that even if @xmath43 is constant , @xmath61 must be either constant ( leading back to the stationary case ) or a linear function , which is inconsistent with the log - link formulation of the model ( cf .  ) .",
    "we propose a solution to this problem by using a special functional form for the scale and shape parameters ( model  ii ) .",
    "observe that according to @xmath62 is linear in @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the proposed forms are @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath54 ) are arbitrary continuous functions of the covariates , subject to a constraint that @xmath67 for all @xmath22 and @xmath60 ( so as to ensure the positivity of the scale parameter @xmath62 ) . to keep the functional form as simple as possible , it is also assumed that @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are linear functions of the covariates @xmath68 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the functional form , ensures the threshold stability : @xmath69 and so the condition holds .",
    "estimation of the unknown parameters can be implemented by a metropolis  hastings type mcmc algorithm ( see @xcite for a discussion of the mcmc techniques ) .",
    "the updating proposals at each step are sampled from a normal distribution centred at the current value of the markov chain , with a fixed standard deviation tuned in advance @xcite .",
    "the priors for different parameters are taken to be independent and normally distributed . from this information ,",
    "the likelihood and prior ratios can be effectively calculated during the mcmc simulation .",
    "an important issue is the choice of an optimal model , i.e.  deciding on which of the @xmath33 covariates should be included in the model to explain most of the variation in the responses . in the bayesian context , this problem is handled by embedding an indicator vector @xmath70 into the model , where @xmath71 if the @xmath72-th covariate is included and @xmath73 otherwise ( @xmath74 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose the prior distribution of @xmath75 so that its components @xmath76 are mutually independent and symmetric ( i.e.  @xmath77 ) , making all of the @xmath78 possible models equally weighted .",
    "the posterior distribution of @xmath75 measures the significance of the covariates , thus facilitating the variable selection .      choosing the relevant explanatory covariates to draw inference is a key step during the model building , upon which the model performance depends strongly .",
    "the sensitivity of the model to the impact of covariates is pinpointed by the complexity of the physical and chemical mechanisms governing the pollultant concentrations @xcite .",
    "the traffic and meteorological data at our disposal ( see the introduction ) are specified as follows : the traffic flow _",
    "( number of vehicles per 15 min ) and traffic speed _ ts _ ( average speed over 15 min , measured in kph = kilometres per hour ) , both monitored for the two categories , light duty vehicles ( ldv ) including cars , and heavy goods vehicles ( hgv ) ; relative humidity _ rh _ ; solar radiation _ sr _ ; wind speed _ ws _ ; wind direction _ wd _ ; and temperature",
    "_ t_.    to account for physical and chemical covariates for which we have no data ( such as temporal patterns of potential point sources , e.g.factories and other industrial units displaying seasonal behaviour ) , we introduce the so - called _ composite variables_. the choice of these variables is also based on a seasonality and periodicity analysis of the measured concentrations .",
    "we use fourier components accounting for the yearly , weekly and daily seasonal and periodic fluctuations .",
    "the assumption that the model parameters vary smoothly with certain covariates is consistent with the underlying physics .",
    "therefore , instead of using the time variables as factor or dummy variables , they are converted into circular ones .",
    "further advantage of this approach is that the number of parameters for estimation is substantially reduced as compared to using dummy variables .",
    "a pilot study was conducted using the variable selection technique ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : mcmc ] ) to assess the significance of these variables .",
    "the results suggested that second - order terms of all circular variables and third - order terms of the daily fourier components should be sufficient for inclusion as the model covariates .",
    "in addition , first - order interaction terms between the meteorological variables and wind speed were also deployed .",
    "lagged concentrations were included in the model with the aim to account for residual dependencies due to unobserved covariates .",
    "based on the examination of the corresponding partial autocorrelation plots , it was concluded that the fourth - order autoregressive scheme was adequate .",
    "let us now make a few comments about the _ traffic variables_. according to @xcite , for the average uk vehicle fleet the @xmath4 emissions are highest at lowest cruise speeds , significantly decreasing until speeds reach about 6070 ( kph ) , above which emissions tend to increase slightly at higher speeds .",
    "once traffic flows reach the capacity of the road , they become unstable and congestion can be caused .",
    "the resulting acceleration , deceleration and idling of vehicles within the flow generate elevated emissions .",
    "in contrast , the traffic regime that provides lowest emissions is driving at steady state ( cruise ) avoiding alternating periods of acceleration , deceleration and idling .",
    "following bell et al .",
    "@xcite who categorized the traffic flow regimes in urban environments into states corresponding to different levels of emissions congestion , the observed 15-min traffic flow is treated as a factor with four levels : @xmath79 ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) ; @xmath82 ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) ; @xmath85 ( @xmath86 , @xmath84 ) ; and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .      in the applications of extreme value theory , predictive inference for unobserved events",
    "requires extrapolation ; e.g. , it is common to calculate the @xmath11-year return levels ( say , with @xmath89 ) .",
    "the @xmath90-year return level @xmath91 of a pollutant ( with a given small @xmath92 ) is defined by the relation @xmath93 , i.e.  @xmath91 is the 100@xmath94% quantile of @xmath95 . assuming stationarity of observations of @xmath95 ( e.g.  if @xmath96 are i.i.d . ) , the value @xmath91 is exceeded approximately once every @xmath90 observations .",
    "non - stationarity can be modelled using the conditional distribution of @xmath97 , whereby the corresponding @xmath90-year return level @xmath98 is defined by the relation @xmath99 when the aim is to quantify the effect of future emission ( e.g.under a new traffic policy ) or a possible climate change , equation provides a simple measure of how a particular scenario might affect the extreme pollution concentration levels .    in the bayesian context , estimation of the marginal and conditional return levels , as well as evaluation of the posterior distribution of the probabilities of extreme events",
    ", can be carried out using mcmc - generated posterior samples for the model parameters ; e.g. , a simple way to estimate the posterior distribution of the @xmath11-year marginal return level is to simulate @xmath100-year observations @xmath101 using @xmath100 different samples of parameters from the corresponding posterior distributions , and then take the @xmath102-th largest observation .    to simulate a sequence of observations @xmath10 of length @xmath100 , the simulation method should be non - parametric with regard to the unknown distribution of the covariates , for which no assumptions are being made .",
    "following eastoe @xcite , one approach is to re - sample with replacement from observed covariate values and to use the corresponding empirical distribution .",
    "however , non - stationarity of the covariates on the temporal scale must be retained , including seasonal , weekly and daily trends . to this end , as mentioned after equation  , the distribution density @xmath53 of the covariate vector @xmath32 should be estimated using the covariate values observed under similar conditions ( say , in the same part of year , day of week , and hour of day ) .",
    "alternatively , as was adopted in the present study , the observed traffic and meteorological covariates can simply be recycled , which automatically preserves their temporal dependence .",
    "the random sequence of exceedances @xmath103 can be simulated as follows , using a fourth - order autoregressive scheme within the covariates ( see sect .  [ subsec : covariates ] ) .",

    "[ fig : time_series_concentration ] .",
