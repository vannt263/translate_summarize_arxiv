    "star formation in the galaxy occurs on all scales from a small globule collapsing into a single star with planetary system to a giant molecular cloud complex forming rich stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "most stars form in gravitationally unbound groups , and many of these are relatively sparse groups with @xmath10 members and initial surface density @xmath11 stars / pc@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "unbound sparse clusters are difficult to study because their members quickly disperse and are not easily discriminated from the older galactic field population .",
    "x - ray selection is effective here : median x - ray luminosities of pre - main sequence stars are 30 ( 5 ) times higher than zams pleiades - age stars , and 500 ( 500 ) times higher than solar neighborhood stars for @xmath13 ( 0.3 ) m@xmath3 stars @xcite .",
    "x - ray surveys are also effective in identifying young stars which have lost their protoplanetary disks , and thus effectively complement infrared surveys that preferentially select for disk emission @xcite .",
    "for example , _ rosat _ studies were responsible for locating most known dispersed @xmath14 myr old stars associated with the tw hya and @xmath15 cha associations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , while _ xmm - newton _ studies are helping to identify @xmath16  myr old members of the upper scorpius association @xcite .",

    "* ) , in rich clusters ( e.g. , orion nebula cluster , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in sparse gravitationally bound multiple systems @xcite .",
    "some progress is being made towards characterizing the population , dynamics , and particularly the protoplanetary disk evolution of stars born in sparse clusters .",
    "@xcite employed @xmath17 irac photometry to detect a @xmath18 disk fraction around late - type members of the 8  myr old @xmath15 cha cluster at @xmath19  pc .",
    "this disk fraction is higher than expected from studies of richer clusters where a 6  myr maximum lifetime for inner disks was derived by @xcite .",
    "this argues against a single dissipation timescale for all environments and all disk radii .",
    "@xmath17 irs spectroscopy of @xmath15 cha stars by @xcite show that the dissipation timescale may be a strong function of binarity , with disks lasting longer around single stars .",
    "we report here a new x - ray selected sample of young stars to further these studies .",
    "the target is cometary globule cg  12 (= mbm 112 ) @xcite , a relatively poorly studied small star forming region at high galactic latitude @xmath20 , which is producing a sparse unbound cluster of young stars .",
    "shown in figure  [ fig_dss_combined ] , the head of cg  12 is the reflection nebula ngc  5367 (= gn 13.54.7 ) illuminated by the double b4 + b7 star herschel  4636 (= cd -39@xmath218581 ) @xcite .",
    "signs of ongoing star formation include co molecular cores @xcite , several iras sources @xcite , a bipolar molecular outflow @xcite , and three stars with k - band excesses @xcite .",
    "optical photometry and spectroscopy of the brightest stars in the region reveal three b type ( b4 , b7 , b8 ) and two a type ( a2 + a4 ) candidate members @xcite .",
    "the most recent mass estimate for the total of all three molecular cloud cores ( cg  12sw , cg  12s , and cg  12n ) found in cg  12 , ranges from @xmath22 to @xmath23  m@xmath24 with the peak column density through the densest core , cg  12n , of @xmath25  @xmath26 ( @xmath27  mag ) @xcite .",
    "due to its high galactic latitude , contamination by field stars and obscuration by foreground interstellar matter is much lower than for most star forming regions .",
    "compact cgs , along with other bok globules , are interpreted as the last vestiges of the molecular cloud that gave birth to ob stars @xcite .",
    "cgs are distributed widely across the milky way but are rarely found at high latitude @xcite .",
    "most lie within giant hii regions such as ic  2944 , the rosette and carina nebulae , and most prominently in the huge expanding gum nebulae surrounding the vela ob2 association .",
    "cgs are modeled as externally illuminated , photoevaporated and ablated into elongated head - tail morphologies by ultraviolet radiation of ob stars @xcite .",
    "it is likely that pressure from the ionization shock front at the surface propagates through a globule and overcomes the magnetic , turbulent and thermal pressure that supports it against collapse , thereby triggering star formation .",
    "this process of radiation - driven implosion ( rdi ) in molecular globules was originally studied through analytical models for spherical clouds @xcite and 2-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "recent 3-dimensional calculations of rdi processes in molecular globules , including self - gravity , heating , and cooling , are presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the characteristic timescale for producing cometary morphologies and inducing gravitational collapse is @xmath28  myr .",
    "generally , the stellar populations of these isolated triggered star formation regions are poorly known . some globules show clear evidence for embedded young stars , such as _ iras _ sources , while others do not .",
    "h@xmath29 and @xmath30 surveys of bright - rimmed globules containing embedded iras sources revealed several cases with small clusters of t  tauri and @xmath5-band excess stars within and in front of the bright rim @xcite . molecular outflows and masers are found in several globule cores with iras sources @xcite . directly supporting the rdi triggering mechanism , age gradients in the stellar population ( where the youngest stars are embedded and older stars are aligned toward the ionizing sources ) have been recently reported in irradiated molecular globules within the large ic  1848 and ic  1396 hii regions @xcite .",
    "for example , our @xmath0/@xmath17 study of ic  1396n revealed a spatial - age gradient in the globule from class  iii to class  i/0 among 25 young objects @xcite .",
    "the existence of any star forming dark cloud at galactic location @xmath20 is unusual , and the cometary structure of cg  12 in such an isolated environment is even more mysterious .",
    "there are no reported luminous ob - type stars at even higher latitudes to produce the head - tail morphology with its tail pointing towards ( not away from ) the galactic plane . the origin of cg  12 is thus uncertain .",
    "@xcite suggested that a high latitude supernova explosion ( @xmath31 ) could have ablated the cloud and triggered star formation .",
    "we develop these ideas here and identify a specific stellar group which may be responsible for compressing and ablating the cg  12 cloud .",
    "the cg  12 population is likely to be far larger than that of previously studied molecular globules .",
    "the presence of five intermediate - mass ( @xmath32 m@xmath3 ) b4-a4 stars @xcite demands the presence of @xmath33 stars with masses @xmath34 m@xmath3 and @xmath35 stars with masses @xmath36 m@xmath3 , assuming a galactic field initial mass function @xcite .",
    "thus , roughly a hundred cloud members are expected to be present .",
    "a fraction of these stars have already been detected in x - rays , although the result has not been published . an archived 9 ks @xmath37-pspc image ( obtained to study shadowing of the soft x - ray background by cg  12 ) harbors @xmath33 soft x - ray sources within the globule s head and in the arc around the globule ( figure [ fig_rosat ] ) .",
    "most of those are clearly not background sources , as the remainder of the @xmath37 field is nearly empty .",
    "cg  12 thus appears to be the most active star forming center among the known cometary globules , and should provide a valuable laboratory for testing theories of triggered star formation .",
    "this paper begins a study of the cg  12 stellar population based on an x - ray survey designed to address the issues outlined above .",
    "we discuss the population , spatial and age distribution , dynamics , and star formation history .",
    "we suggest how a cg morphology arose at this atypical isolated location .",

    "we end in  [ discussion_section ] with a discussion of the new observational findings and their implications for the history of star formation and origin of cg  12 .",
    "the current project combines four x - ray observations of the globule , one primary field ( i in fig .",
    "[ fig_dss_combined ] ) with @xmath38  ks exposure directed at the globule s core and three secondary fields ( ii , iii , and iv in fig .",
    "[ fig_dss_combined ] ) with @xmath39  ks exposures positioned contiguously to the north and west of the core .",
    "the primary pointing is intended to detect the population of pre - main sequence stars forming in the molecular head of the globule .",
    "the secondary pointings are designed to locate an older population of stars expected if the present cloud is only the ablated remnant of a larger cloud that experienced sequential star formation triggering events , similar to the sequence of stars found in our @xmath0 study of ic  1396n @xcite .",
    "the observations were obtained with the acis camera @xcite on - board _ chandra _ @xcite as described in table 1 . for each observation",
    "we consider here only results arising from the imaging array ( acis - i ) of four abutted @xmath40 pixel front - side illuminated charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) covering about @xmath41 on the sky .",
    "the s2 and s3 detectors in the spectroscopic array ( acis - s ) were also operational , but as the telescope point spread function ( psf ) is considerably degraded far off - axis , the s2-s3 data are omitted from the analysis .",

    "the slight psf broadening from the @xmath0 x - ray center s ( cxc s ) software randomization of positions is removed .",
    "based on several dozen matches between bright @xmath0 and 2mass point sources , we applied a small astrometric correction to source positions to place the absolute astrometry to the _ hipparcos _ reference frame . these and later procedures were performed with @xmath44 software package 3.3 , @xmath45 3.2.1 , @xmath46 6.1.1 , version 1.44 , and the package version 3.94 .",

    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between a source s significance and net counts ( a similar correspondence is seen in the @xmath0 data of ic  1396 globule , see figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "this uniform background is much simpler than in the @xmath0 orion ultradeep project ( coup ) observation of the orion nebula cluster where source crowding , readout trails and psf wings from bright sources complicate the analysis @xcite .",

    "the addition of a spatial distribution of infrared - bright low mass stars with massive disks , as found from @xmath17 irac maps of ic  1396n by @xcite , may give a crucial new clue and could establish the validity of the expected cloud ablation and sequential triggered star formation mechanism .      with a strange location and orientation , and",
    "no reported external hot ob star further from the plane illuminating and ablating the globule , the origin of cg  12 is very uncertain .",
    "the best attempted explanation was made 30 years ago by @xcite who suggested that a large expanding high - latitude interstellar shell could have traversed cg  12 7 - 19  myr ago .",

    "this explanation suffers a major difficulty : a single supernova explosion ( perhaps from a runaway o star ejected from a galactic plane cluster ) can not be responsible for such a large @xmath224 cavity , while a superbubble produced by many supernova remnants requires a rich high - latitude stellar cluster which has not yet been identified .    to further test this model",

    "stellar properties of these b - type stars , which we tentatively call the hd  120958 group , are listed in table [ tbl_btype_cluster ] .",
    "compared to the orion nebular cluster ( onc ) @xcite , the hd  120958 group has the same number of b5-b9 stars ( 5 late - b stars ) but only one star of earlier type @xmath122 11 in the onc where the population extends to o7 .",
    "these massive stars may be missing because they have gone supernova over the past @xmath197  myr , the lifetime of b1 - 3 stars @xcite .",
    "this sequence of supernova shocks could have elongated the cg  12 cloud into its current cometary structure and triggered repeated episodes of star formation symbols in figure [ fig_origin]@xmath215 lies in or near the hd  120958 group .",

    "the star hd  120958 deserves special attention . among other b - type members of the group ,",
    "it is the closest to cg  12 ( only @xmath235  pc away providing they lie at the same distance ) and is precisely positioned on the axis of the cg  12 cometary tail ( figure [ fig_origin]@xmath177 ) .",
    "it is also the most luminous star in the region .",
    "a b5 spectral type was originally assigned in the hd catalog but later reclassified to b3vne in the michigan catalogue of @xcite .",
    "their footnotes on the star indicate balmer line cores in emission and extremely broad lines in absorption , general observational characteristics of classical be stars @xcite .",
    "while there is now a consensus that a classical be star is a rapidly rotating b - type star that produces a disk in its equatorial plane , no certain picture of the evolutionary state of be phenomenon is available ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "some fraction of be stars are produced in binaries @xcite , and be@xmath231neutron star ( ns ) systems represent the largest sub - class of massive x - ray binaries known @xcite . according to the evolutionary model of such a binary ,",
    "the progenitor of the be star acquires its rapid rotation via mass and angular momentum transfer from the primary companion , which in turn undergoes a sn stage and turns into a ns @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission from be@xmath231ns systems is usually transient .    it is thus reasonable to suggest that hd  120958 , well - positioned along the geometric axis of cg  12 , could be the relic of a massive binary system where the primary has evolved into a sn .",
    "the encounter of the sn remnant with the cloud could be , at least in part , responsible for both the star formation and the cometary morphology of the cloud .",
    "we have found no evidence for a transient x - ray source coincident with hd  120958 .",
    "another , perhaps less plausible , scenario considering hd  120958 to be responsible for the morphology of cg  12 and origin of its stellar population , can be suggested . in this case",
    "the b3e hd  120958 star itself could be the primary ionizing source of the region .",
    "as in the hundred known cases of small bright rimmed clouds ( brcs ) believed to exibit the rdi mechanism , hd  120958 would produce an ionization front at the surface of the cg  12 cloud , which could slowly ablate and drive shocks into the cloud . in this scenario",
    "the poorly studied b77  146 nebula @xcite , located just at the surface of the cloud ( figures [ fig_dss_combined ] and [ fig_combined_rgb]@xmath177 ) and interpreted as a reflection nebula powered by the a2 member of the region @xcite , could be in fact an ionization front produced by the uv radiation from hd  120958 .",
    "however in comparison with other known brcs , the cg  12 again would represent a rather atypical case with a cooler and more distant primary ionizing source . several brcs illuminated by a single b - type",
    "are known , but all with spectral types earlier than b2 , and with distances to brcs @xmath236  pc @xcite .",
    "we report results from a mosaic of four @xmath0 acis - i images ( @xmath217  pc@xmath12 ) designed to study the young stellar population and star formation in the high - latitude cometary globule cg  12 .",
    "the main findings of our study are as follows :    \\1 . of the 128 x - ray sources detected in the @xmath0 fields covering the globule s head and its vicinity ,",
    "55 have been identified with known onir objects .",
    "in addition to several known young intermediate - mass stars , we discovered a previously unknown population of @xmath1 t - tauri members .",
    "most are unobscured but some lie inside the cloud .",
    "three protostars embedded in the molecular cloud cores are detected , one of which is newly reported .",
    "we establish that the remaining @xmath237 x - ray sources are likely contaminants , mostly extragalactic , based on simulations of galactic and extragalactic populations , the presence or absence of onir counterparts , spatial distribution , and x - ray properties .    \\2 . based on available onir photometry of the cg  12 t - tauri stars , we infer they are mostly low - mass @xmath2  m@xmath24 stars , @xmath238 of which possess @xmath127 disks .",
    "this low fraction of @xmath239excess stars is similar to older t - tauri populations ( e.g. @xmath15  cha with age @xmath144  myr ) and substantially lower than that of younger pms populations ( e.g. the taurus clouds ) .",
    "\\3 . using the known @xmath155 corrections ,",
    "we combine x - ray and onir properties of the unobscured t - tauri stars to independently confirm that the distance to cg  12 must be @xmath240  pc , and probably in the range @xmath167  pc .",
    "this strengthens previous onir findings that cg  12 is indeed located @xmath6  pc above the galactic plane , and that its cometary morphology with no signs of nearby hot ob stars is unusual .",
    "an evaluation of stellar ages gives a median photometric isochronal age of @xmath8  myr with a large spread from @xmath194  myr to @xmath241  myr .",
    "the x - ray properties of three deeply embedded stars confirm the protostellar classification and previous infrared - radio findings of ongoing star formation in the globule s head .",
    "\\5 . assuming the galactic field imf for the unobscured yso population of cg  12",
    ", we estimate a total population of @xmath179 stars associated with cg  12 with masses @xmath242 m@xmath3 .",
    "the star formation efficiency of the globule is in the range @xmath7% , typical for active star forming regions , but above that seen in smaller molecular globules with star formation triggered by uv shock fronts .",
    "the age and spatial distribution of young stars is consistent with that seen in other star forming regions , but is inconsistent with a simple model of radiative driven implosion often applied to explain cg morphology and star formation .",
    "this suggests either that cg  12 is atypically large so that a triggering shock takes millions of years to traverse the cloud , or that cg  12 has been subject to several distinct episodes of triggering and ablation over millions of years .",
    "examination of the vicinity of the cloud leads to a revised scenario for the origin of the cg  12 star forming region .",
    "we identify a group of b - type stars northwest of cg  12 and infer that a dozen expected early o - b3 type members are missing . these could be the source of multiple sn explosions triggering star formation in the cloud over an extended period of @xmath197  myr .",
    "the b3e star hd  120958 is the closest and most luminous member of the group , lying 10  pc ( projected ) from the globule head in the correct orientation to ablate the cloud into its cometary structure .",
    "it might itself be the primary ionizing source driving an rdi shock into the cg  12 cloud , or might be the relic of a massive binary system that has undergone sn explosion .",

    "<S> the mysterious high galactic latitude cometary globule ( cg ) cg  12 has been observed with the acis detector on board the @xmath0 x - ray observatory . we detect 128 x - ray sources , of which a half are likely young stars formed within the globule s head . </S>",
    "<S> this new population of @xmath1 t - tauri stars and one new embedded protostar is far larger than the previously reported few intermediate - mass and two protostellar members of the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> most of the newly discovered stars have masses @xmath2  m@xmath3 , and @xmath4 have @xmath5band excesses from inner protoplanetary disks . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray properties provide an independent distance estimate consistent with cg  12 s unusual location @xmath6  pc above the galactic plane . </S>",

    "<S> the stellar age and spatial distributions are inconsistent with a simple radiation driven implosion ( rdi ) model , and suggest either that cg  12 is an atypically large shocked globule , or it has been subject to several distinct episodes of triggering and ablation . </S>",
    "<S> we report a previously unnoticed group of b - type stars northwest of cg  12 which may be the remnants of an ob association which produced multiple supernova explosions that could have shocked and ablated the cloud over a 15 - 30  myr period . </S>",
    "<S> hd  120958 ( b3e ) , the most luminous member of the group , may be currently driving an rdi shock into the cg  12 cloud . </S>"
