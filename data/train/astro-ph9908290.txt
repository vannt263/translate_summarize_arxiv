    "bh / ns and ns / ns mergers are discussed as promising candidates for the origin of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. , blinnikov et al . 1984 ; eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; paczyski 1991 ; narayan , piran , & shemi 1992 ; mszros 1999 ; fryer , woosley , & hartmann 1999 ; bethe & brown 1998 , 1999 ) , at least for the subclass of less complex and less energetic short and hard bursts ( mao , narayan , & piran 1994 ) with durations of fractions of a second ( popham , woosley , & fryer 1999 ; ruffert & janka 1999 ) . optical counterparts and afterglows of this subclass have not yet been observed . due to the presence of a region of very low baryon density above the poles of the black hole , bh",
    "/ ns mergers are considered as more favorable sources than ns / ns mergers ( e.g. , portegies zwart 1998 ; brown et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "previous newtonian sph simulations of bh / ns mergers using a polytropic equation of state indicate that the neutron star may slowly lose gas in many mass transfer cycles ( kluniak & lee 1998 ; lee & kluniak 1998,1999 ) . whether dynamical instability sets in at a minimum separation ( rasio & shapiro 1994 ; lai , rasio , & shapiro 1994 ) or whether stable roche lobe overflow takes place , however , can depend on the neutron star to black hole mass ratio ( bildsten & cutler 1992 ) and the properties of the nuclear equation of state , expressed by the adiabatic index ( ury & eriguchi 1999 ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report about the first newtonian bh / ns merger simulations ( eberl 1998 ) which were done with a realistic nuclear equation of state ( lattimer & swesty 1991 ) and which therefore yield information about the thermodynamic evolution and the neutrino emission .",
    "they allow one to compare the strength of the gravitational wave ( gw ) emission relative to ns / ns mergers and to investigate neutrino - antineutrino ( @xmath14 ) annihilation as potential source of energy for grbs .",
    "the three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were performed with a eulerian ppm code using four levels of nested cartesian grids which ensure a good resolution near the center of mass and a large computational volume simultaneously .",
    "each grid had 64@xmath15 zones , the size of the smallest zone was 0.64 or 0.78@xmath3 km in case of ns / ns and 1.25 or 1.5@xmath3 km for bh / ns mergers .",
    "the zone sizes of the next coarser grid levels were doubled to cover a volume of 328 or 400@xmath3 km side length for ns / ns and 640 or 768@xmath3 km for bh / ns simulations .",
    "gw emission and its backreaction on the hydrodynamics were taken into account by the method of blanchet , damour , & schfer ( 1990 ) ( see ruffert , janka , & schfer 1996 ) .",
    "the neutrino emission and corresponding energy and lepton number changes of the matter were calculated with an elaborate neutrino leakage scheme ( ruffert , janka , & schfer 1996 ) , and @xmath14 annihilation around the merger was evaluated in a post - processing step ( ruffert et al .",
    "table  1 gives a list of computed ns / ns and bh / ns merger models . besides the baryonic mass of the neutron star and the mass of the black hole , the spins of the neutron stars were varied .",
    "`` solid '' means synchronously rotating stars , `` none '' irrotational cases and `` anti '' counter - rotation , i.e. , spin vectors opposite to the direction of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the cool neutron stars have a radius of about 15@xmath3 km ( ruffert , janka , & schfer 1996 ) and the runs were started with a center - to - center distance of 4246@xmath3 km for ns / ns and with 47@xmath3 km in case of bh / ns for @xmath16 , 57@xmath3 km for @xmath17 and 72@xmath3 km for @xmath18 .",
    "the simulations were stopped at a time @xmath19 between 10@xmath3ms and @xmath20ms .",
    "the black hole was treated as a point mass at the center of a sphere with radius @xmath21 which gas could enter unhindered .",
    "its mass and momentum were updated along with the accretion of matter .",
    "model tn10 , which is added for comparison , is a continuation of the ns / ns merger model b64 where at time @xmath22ms the formation of a black hole was assumed and the accretion was followed for another 5@xmath3ms until a steady state was reached ( ruffert & janka 1999 ) .",
    "due to the emission of gws the orbital separation decreases . during its first approach , the neutron star transfers matter to the black hole at huge rates of several 100 up to @xmath23/s .",
    "within 23@xmath3ms it loses 5075% of its initial mass . in case of the 2.5@xmath24 black hole",
    "the evolution is catastrophic and the neutron star is immediately disrupted ( lattimer & schramm 1974 ) . a mass of 0.20.3@xmath24 remains in a thick disk around the black hole ( @xmath25 in table  2 ) .",
    "in contrast , the orbital distance increases again for @xmath17 and @xmath18 and a significantly less massive neutron star begins a second approach .",
    "again , the black hole swallows gas at rates of more than @xmath26/s .",
    "even a third cycle is possible ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "finally , at a distance @xmath27 and time @xmath28 the neutron star with a mass of @xmath29 is destroyed and most of its mass ends up in an accretion disk ( table  2 ) .",
    "( in case of ns / ns mergers @xmath28 means the time when the two density maxima of the stars are one stellar radius , i.e. , @xmath30 km , apart ) .",
    "the increase of the orbital separation is connected with a strong rise of the specific ( orbital ) angular momentum of the gas ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "partly this is due to the fact that the black hole can capture gas with low specific angular momentum first , but mainly because only a fraction of the orbital angular momentum of the accreted gas is fed into spinning up the black hole .",
    "this fraction , which is lost for the orbital motion , is proportional to the quantity @xmath31 in fig .  2 .",
    "figure  2 is based on the parameterized analysis of non - conservative mass - transfer by podsiadlowski , joss , & hsu ( 1992 ) ( see also fryer et al .",
    "1999 ) assuming that mass ejection from the system is negligible .",
    "it shows that disregarding gw emission , the orbital separation can increase for small initial black hole mass only after the neutron star has lost much mass , while for larger initial @xmath32 and smaller @xmath31 orbital widening is easier . without gws",
    "the separation increases when @xmath33 .",
    "including angular momentum loss by gws in the point - mass approximation and using the mass - loss rates from the hydrodynamic models ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 ) yields a qualitative understanding of the behavior visible in fig .  1 and suggests that @xmath31 is between 0.2 and 0.5 .",
    "during the merging a gas mass @xmath34 of @xmath35 ( in case of counter - rotation and @xmath16 ) to @xmath36 ( corotation and @xmath18 ) is dynamically ejected ( table  2 ) . in the latter case",
    "the associated angular momentum loss is about 7% , in all other cases it is less than 5% of the total initial angular momentum of the system .",
    "another fraction of up to 24% of the initial angular momentum is carried away by gws . in table",
    "2 the rotation parameter @xmath37 is given for the initial state of the binary system ( @xmath38 ) and at the end of the simulation ( @xmath39 ) for the remnant of ns / ns mergers or for the black hole in bh / ns systems , respectively , provided the black hole did not have any initial spin .",
    "when the whole disk mass @xmath25 has been swallowed by the kerr black hole , a final value @xmath40 ( table  2 ) will be reached in case of the accretion of a corotating , thin disk with maximum radiation efficiency .    the phase of largest mass flow rate to the black hole ( between 2 and 5@xmath3ms after the start of the simulations )",
    "is connected with a maximum of the gw luminosity @xmath41 which reaches up to @xmath42erg / s ( table  1 ) .",
    "the peak values of @xmath41 and the wave amplitude @xmath43 ( for distance @xmath44 from the source ) increase with the black hole mass .",
    "the total energy @xmath45 radiated in gws can be as much as @xmath46 for @xmath18 .",
    "compressional heating , shear due to numerical viscosity , and dissipation in shocks heat the gas during accretion to maximum temperatures @xmath47 of several 10@xmath3mev .",
    "average temperatures are between 5 and 20@xmath3mev , the higher values for the less massive and more compact black holes . at these temperatures and at densities of @xmath48@xmath49g / cm@xmath15 in the accretion flow , electrons are non - degenerate and positrons abundant .",
    "electron neutrinos and antineutrinos are therefore copiously created via reactions @xmath51 and @xmath52 and dominate the neutrino energy loss from the accreted matter .",
    "dense and hot neutron matter is not completely transparent to neutrinos . by taking into account the finite diffusion time , the neutrino trapping scheme limits the loss of energy and lepton number .    in table  1",
    "maximum and average values of the luminosities ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , the latter in brackets ) in the simulated time intervals are listed for @xmath55 and @xmath56 and for the sum of all heavy - lepton neutrinos .",
    "the latter are denoted by @xmath57 and are mainly produced by @xmath58 annihilation .",
    "the total neutrino luminosities @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "3 ) fluctuate strongly with the varying mass transfer rate to the black hole during the cycles of orbital decay and widening ( compare with fig .  1 ) .",
    "the total energy @xmath60 radiated in neutrinos in 1020@xmath3ms is typically several @xmath61erg .",
    "time averages of the mean energies @xmath62 of the emitted neutrinos are @xmath63mev for @xmath55 , 20@xmath3mev for @xmath56 , and 30@xmath3mev for @xmath64 .",
    "luminosities as well as mean energies , in particular for smaller black holes , are significantly higher than in case of ns / ns mergers .    at the end of the simulations ,",
    "several of the bh / ns models have reached a steady state , characterized by only a slow growth of the black hole mass with a nearly constant accretion rate .",
    "corresponding rates @xmath65 are given in table  2 and are several @xmath66/s . from these",
    "we estimate torus life times @xmath67 of 50150@xmath3ms .",
    "values with @xmath68 and @xmath69 signs indicate cases where the evolution and emission are still strongly time - dependent at @xmath19 . in these cases",
    "the accretion torus around the black hole has also not yet developed axial symmetry . in all other cases",
    "the effective disk viscosity parameter @xmath70 , evaluated at a representative disk radius of @xmath71 , has the same value , 4@xmath72 .",
    "this value is associated with the numerical viscosity of the hydro code ( which solves the euler equations ) for the chosen resolution .",
    "the further disk evolution is driven by the angular momentum transport mediated by viscous shear forces , which determines the accretion rate .",
    "the physical value of the disk viscosity is unknown .",
    "the numerical viscosity of our code , however , is in the range where the viscous energy dissipation and the energy emission by neutrinos should be roughly equal , i.e. , where the conversion efficiency @xmath73 of rest - mass energy to neutrinos is nearly maximal ( see ruffert et al .",
    "1997 ; ruffert & janka 1999 ) .    assuming that the average neutrino luminosity @xmath74 at @xmath19 is representative for the subsequent accretion phase , we obtain for @xmath75 numbers between 4 and 6% and total energies @xmath76 around @xmath77erg ( table  2 ) .",
    "annihilation of neutrino pairs , @xmath78 , deposits energy at rates up to @xmath79erg / s in the vicinity of the black hole ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "this corresponds to total energies @xmath80 as high as @xmath81erg and annihilation efficiencies @xmath82 of 13% .",
    "these estimates should not change much if the different effects of general relativity on @xmath14 annihilation are taken into account in combination ( ruffert & janka 1999 ; asano & fukuyama 1999 ) , but general relativistic simulations of the merging are very important .",
    "more energy could be pumped into the @xmath83 fireball when the black hole rotates rapidly ( popham , woosley , & fryer 1999 ) or if magnetic fields are able to tap the rotational energy of the accretion torus and of the black hole with higher efficiency than @xmath14 annihilation does ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "this seems to be necessary for the long and very energetic grbs ( mszros , rees , & wijers 1999 ; brown et al .",
