    "the goal of this paper is to contribute to the problem of classification of discrete three - dimensional ( 3d ) integrable systems .",
    "the notion of integrability we adhere to is the _",
    "multidimensional consistency_. it originates in the development of integrable structures of discrete differential geometry , see @xcite for details and for historical remarks .",
    "multidimensional consistency of a given discrete @xmath4-dimensional system means that it can be imposed in a consistent way on all @xmath4-dimensional sublattices of a @xmath5-dimensionl lattice .",
    "in retrospect , this property can be understood as a discrete analog of the existence of commuting hierarchies of integrable systems .",
    "it has been shown that this property guarantees the existence of such integrability attributes as the discrete zero curvature representation and bcklund transformations enjoying bianchi - type permutability . moreover ,",
    "these attributes are encoded in the system itself and can be found in a straightforward and algorithmic way .",
    "thus , multidimensional consistency can be accepted as a rather general and powerful definition of integrability of discrete systems .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a classification of 2d systems on quad - graphs with scalar ( complex ) fields at vertices , integrable in the sense of 3d consistency , was performed . as a result of this classification ,",
    "a rather short but exhaustive list of integrable systems of this kind was produced , known nowadays as the abs list .",
    "moreover , one class of multidimensionally consistent 3d systems has been classified , namely those of the octahedron type @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the relevant combinatorial structure in this case is a multidimensional root lattice of type a. the most striking feature is that the number of integrable systems drops dramatically with increasing dimension : only half a dozen of discrete 3d systems with the property of 4d consistency are known , almost all of them are of a geometric origin .    in the present paper , we classify 3d maps within certain general ansatz , which are 4d consistent .",
    "the main result of our classification is that , within the considered class , the only non - trivial 4d consistent map is the symmetric discrete darboux system ( equation below ) .",
    "note that this system appeared in the study of multi - dimensional circular nets @xcite , see also @xcite , and enjoys several distinct geometric interpretations , for which one can consult @xcite and @xcite .",
    "consider a 3d map @xmath6 .",
    "a possible definition of integrability of such maps is their 4d consistency @xcite , which we describe now .",
    "combinatorially assign the quantities @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 to the three faces of a 3d cube parallel to the coordinate planes @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath13 stand for the unit shift in the @xmath14-th coordinate direction .",
    "we assign the quantities @xmath15 to the three opposite faces .",
    "therefore we view the map @xmath16 as [ eq : map ] _",
    "123(x_12,x_13,x_23)=(t_3 x_12,t_2 x_13,t_1 x_23 ) , where the indices @xmath17 of @xmath16 represent the 3d space where the map acts .",
    "more generally , we assume that in any 3d sublattice of @xmath18 spanned by the directions @xmath19 @xmath20 there acts a map @xmath21 .",
    "now consider the initial value problem with data @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , prescribed at six squares adjacent to one common vertex of the 4d cube .",
    "then the application of a 3d map like ( [ eq : map ] ) to the four 3d cubes adjacent to this vertex allows us to determine all @xmath25 : @xmath26 at the second stage , the map is applied to the other four 3d cubes of the 4d cube : @xmath27 now , 4d consistency of @xmath21 means that the following six equations are identically satisfied for arbitrary initial data : [ eq : 4d consistency ] t_(t_k x_ij)=t_k(t_x_ij ) , i < j,\\{i , j , k,}=\\{1,2,3,4}.    in this setting , the two most celebrated 4d consistent maps are the symmetric discrete darboux system , @xmath28 ( where one assumes that @xmath29 ) , and the star - triangle map , @xmath30 ( where one assumes that @xmath31 ) .",
    "we consider maps ( [ eq : map ] ) given by ( formal or convergent ) series of the following kind : [ eq : map series ] t_k x_ij = x_ij + _ m=2^a_ij ; k^(m)(x_ij , x_ik , x_jk ) , where @xmath1 are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath2 of their respective arguments .",
    "each time when the double indices are associated with a 2d coordinate plane ( i.e. , in notations like @xmath22 , @xmath1 ) we assume that the two indices are permutable , that is , @xmath29 , @xmath32 , etc . note that the darboux system ( [ eq : darboux shift ] ) belongs to this class , while the star - triangle map ( [ eq : star - triang shift ] ) does not for two reasons : first , the skew - symmetry assumption @xmath31 is enforced , and second , it is not close to identity",
    ".    we will classify 4d consistent maps of type ( [ eq : map series ] ) .",
    "we perform the classification modulo the group of admissible transformations generated by the point ( coordinate - wise ) transformations [ eq : gauge point ] x_ij x_ij+",
    "_ m=2^b_ij^(m ) x_ij^m , given by ( formal or convergent ) series , and by the scaling transformations [ eq : gauge scale ] x_ij c_ij x_ij . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are arbitrary constants .",
    "indeed , transformations from the group generated by ( [ eq : gauge point ] ) and ( [ eq : gauge scale ] ) leave the form of @xmath21 invariant .",
    "our first aim is to determine quadratic polynomials @xmath35 which can appear as leading terms in 4d consistent maps satisfying ( [ eq : 4d consistency ] ) .",
    "all lemmas in the present section are devoted to such a characterization .",

    "the monomial @xmath45 can only come from the first term on the left - hand side , and the vanishing of its coefficient results in condition ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
