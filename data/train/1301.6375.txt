    "moreover , the functional form of @xmath2 for a wide variety of organisms is remarkably similar @xcite .",
    "the origins of biological aging has been sought in two broad classes of theories @xcite , which may be non - exclusive .",
    "the first , mechanistic approach , aims to understand aging in terms of mechanical and biochemical processes such as telomere shortening @xcite or reactive oxygen species damage @xcite .",
    "the second approach , considers aging as the outcome of evolutionary forces @xcite .",
    "the early evolutionary theories are based on the observation that selective pressure is larger for traits that appear earlier in life @xcite . as a result , aging ,",
    "it has been argued , could be due to late - acting deleterious mutations accumulated over generations ( mutation accumulation theory , ma ) @xcite or due to mutations that increase fitness early in life at the cost of decreasing fitness later in life ( antagonistic pleiotropy theory , ap ) @xcite .",
    "physiological variants of ap consider the relative energy cost of avoiding aging damage versus reproducing @xcite : mutations diverting energy away from repair and maintenance activities to earlier sexual development and high reproduction rate can be favored .     and random @xmath3 degree distributions respectively .",

    "remain a mystery .",
    "the neutral ( i.e. non - selective , non - directional ) ma theory has two predictions : a monotonic increase in the mortality rate with age , and an increased variation ( spread ) in mortality rate among different polymorphisms with age , both of which disagrees with observation @xcite .",
    "the non - neutral ( i.e. selective , directional ) ap theory predicts that every aging gene comes with an early - life enhancement of fecundity .",
    "while some such genes have been found , others contradict this prediction @xcite . in contrast",
    ", the ideas of gs remain untested .",
    "even if true , these theories do not explain why the mortality rate should increase in time , let alone why so many different organisms should exhibit a similar functional form for @xmath2 .",
    "here we approach the question of aging from an evolutionary perspective , combining ideas from network connectivity @xcite , engineering reliability analysis as applied to aging @xcite , and the theory of constructive neutral evolution @xcite .",
    "much like the historical development of an engineered technological device , the complexity of life appears to have irreversibly increased as a large number of individual sub - units become linked through specialized interdependence . our simulations and analysis allows us to demonstrate that component dependencies established over the course of neutral and non - neutral evolution eventually leads to species with aging curves that are consistent with empirical data .",
    "to study the dynamics of aging quantitatively , we start with a simple view of an organism as a set of nodes with dependencies characterized by directed edges between them . each node may be thought as genes in a regulatory network , or the differentiated cells or tissues in a multicellular organism with specific functions . a directed edge from node @xmath12 to node",

    "it seems difficult to determine or modulate @xmath28 , though it should roughly correlate with the `` complexity '' of an organism .",
    "the structure of networks is expected to influence the dynamics of any processes on it , including aging .",
    "however we surprisingly observe that different evolutionary processes for network growth lead to similar average lifespans and mortality curves . at either extreme of network structure , we use two strategies to grow them via what may be termed neutral and non - neutral evolution . in either case",
    ", a new node is introduced at every `` evolutionary time step '' such that it depends on one random existing node , and one random existing node depends on it . in the _ constructive neutral _ process",
    ", the new node is equally likely to depend on and provide to any of the existing nodes .",
    "this yields a random dependency network ( rn ) . in the _ constructive non - neutral _ process the probability that a new component will provide or receive from another component with degree @xmath29",
    "is taken proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "this yields a scale - free dependency network ( sfn ) @xcite . in the first scheme there is no difference in fitness based on whom a node relies on ; whereas in the second scheme , relying on a previously unrelied component has a larger fitness cost , making such connections unlikely .",
    "each network topology is diagrammed schematically in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] .",
    "these two schemes are not altogether arbitrary .",
    "they can be justified using biological arguments and are bolstered by empirical evidence .",
    "sfn structures are known to accurately describe the organization of the metabolic networks of many different species @xcite .",
    "a simple evolutionary mechanism @xcite can give rise to a rn structure and account for the complexity of various biological structures via an entropic argument : since the number of configurations in which components randomly depend on each other is overwhelmingly more numerous than the configurations in which all elements are fully independent , an initially - fully - independent collection of components will , statistically speaking , inevitably move towards random interdependence , provided that the fitness cost of introducing a dependency is negligible .",
    "we assume that the aging of complex dependency networks are governed by the following three rules : ( 1 ) every component in the organism must depend on at least one other node , and at least one other node must depend on it ( i.e. all parts of the organism must be fully connected ) .",
    "( 2 ) with certain fixed small probabilities the components can break ( stop functioning ) or be repaired ( start functioning ) .",

    "the effect of the threshold value in the vitality @xmath4 that we use to define death does not affect our simulations for large @xmath28 .",
    "to establish the statistical properties of mortality in our network , we generate an ensemble of networks ( organisms ) and age them according to the above rules .",
    "in addition to tracking the vitality of the network characterized by @xmath4 , we also determine the fraction of networks ( not components ) @xmath60 that remain alive at time @xmath50 so that the time dependent mortality rate is @xmath61/s(t)\\ ] ] we also track the degree of interdependence within a given network ( organism ) , characterized by the ratio @xmath62= \\log [ \\phi(t)]/\\log[\\phi_{0}(t)],\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the expectation value of the vitality of an identical size network with all dependency edges removed",
    ". thus @xmath53 quantifies how much more often a network dies in comparison with one that has no interdependent components .    finally , in order to analyze the magnitudes of functionality loss we consider the probability distribution @xmath64 $ ] of event sizes @xmath56 ( i.e. changes in @xmath51 ) .",
    "each event represents an individual disease or recovery , the final one of which is death .",
    "in our simulations a typical organism starts its life by a slow decay of @xmath51 at a rate of @xmath65 , where the dimensionless number @xmath66 for scale free networks and @xmath67 for random networks . as",
    "an increasing number of nodes die , the system approaches a critical vitality @xmath68 when all live nodes suddenly collapse .",
    "typical trajectories for both network topologies as well as the values of @xmath69 and @xmath10 are shown in fig[1 ] .",
    "we observe that even if @xmath27 is set equal to @xmath25 the system decays steadily despite the seeming reversibility in dynamics .",
    "this is because while any live node can break , not all the dead nodes will have the sufficient number of live providers to sustain a repair .",
    "a number of qualitative features of the mortality curves predicted by our model are independent of the range of parameters we explore and the network structures we chose .",
    "in particular , we see that the following features are generic ( 1 ) there is a slightly higher infant death rate proportional to initial damage @xmath26 followed by a sudden drop in death rate in early childhood ( 2 ) there is an exponential increase in the mortality following this initial blip , consistent with the gompertz law and ( 3 ) there is a final plateau in late - life mortality . in our simulations",
    "aging decelerates in late life and in any case does not increase beyond a critical @xmath70 , the value of which is modulated by @xmath27 ( fig[3b ] ) .",
    "this is particularly clear in fig[2 ] , where we compare the mortality curves generated by our digital populations to that of a variety of organisms , _ c. elegans , drosophila _ , medflies , beetles , mice , himalayan goats ( tahr ) , using data compiled from @xcite , and see reasonable agreement between simulation and data .",
    "since complex interdependence in networks is not exclusive to living organisms , we also fit the empirical aging curves to our model , of two kind of automobiles , the 1980 toyota and 1980 chevrolet ( see supplementary information , figs.1 ) as gathered from @xcite .",
    "an empirical analysis of historical human mortality data has shown that plotting the mortality rate @xmath71 at some age @xmath72 against that at infancy @xmath73 gives a `` universal '' curve that nearly overlaps for many different societies and historical periods @xcite .",
    "in other words , for an arbitrary collection of people ( presumably with different damage /repair rates and initial conditions ) , the mortality rate at any two ages are correlated , with correlation coefficient @xmath74 . in our simulations",
    "we vary @xmath75 while keeping @xmath28 constant and determine correlation coefficients between mortality rates from ages @xmath76 to @xmath77 and from @xmath72 to @xmath78 . for @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "is correlated by @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "these correlation values are nearly identical for scale free and random networks . for details , see supplementary information and fig.s.6 .",
    "the effects of the system parameters on the mortality rate for both scale free and random networks can be summarized as follows : increasing @xmath25 shifts @xmath2 left ( fig[3a ] ) ; increasing @xmath27 decreases the value of the value of @xmath83 at the late life plateau ( fig[3b ] ) ; increasing @xmath28 increases the slope of @xmath84 in the aging ( gompertz ) regime ( fig[3c ] ) ; in other words , larger systems age rapidly and suddenly , while small systems with few components are virtually non - aging . increasing",
    "the initial damage @xmath26 simply elevates the initial ( infant ) mortality rate ( fig[3d ] ) .",
    "our simulations yield a negative correlation between damage and _ increase in _ mortality rate ; the high initial damage populations age slower than the low initial damage populations to eventually converge to the same @xmath70 consistent with strehler - mildvan correlation law @xcite .",
    "the qualitative dependence of average lifetime on damage and repair rate is as intuitively expected ( fig[4a ] ) .",
    "quantitatively , when @xmath52 the average lifespan perfectly fits the curve @xmath85 , with the same value of @xmath86 fitting both scale free and random networks .",
    "curiously , lifespan is very weakly dependent on the repair rate @xmath27 for smaller values until it rapidly diverges at a critical value of @xmath87 .",
    "this makes one wonder why most species are not immortal , but fig[4a ] suggests why : for small @xmath27 , @xmath88 is nearly constant , @xmath89 .",
    "however , if the cost of repairing nodes increases with the probability of repair @xmath27 , increasing @xmath27 becomes evolutionarily nonviable due to the weak dependence of @xmath5 over a wide range of @xmath27 .",
    "that being said , apart from this high evolutionary cost ( and the slim chance of a massive statistical fluctuation of the order @xmath90 which obviously vanishes for @xmath91 ) there is no mechanism in our theory that prevents a high - repair species from being immortal in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the dependency coefficient @xmath92 $ ] gradually increases as our simulated organisms grow older , and diverges just before death ( fig[4b ] ) .",
    "the functional form of @xmath92 $ ] is qualitatively similar for sfn and rn .",
    "we intuitively expect the onset of `` death '' to differ drastically from the early aging process ( referred to as `` disease '' ) . this difference will be reflected in the distribution of the number of living nodes that die in a particular time step ( @xmath93 . in order to tell whether death is just `` the last disease '' or a qualitatively different phenomenon",
    ", we analyze the distribution @xmath94 of event sizes before , after and _ of _ the largest drop and notice that the latter is qualitatively as well as quantitatively very different from the former two .",
    "death and disease occupy an entirely different region of the event spectrum ( fig[4c ] ) .",
    "what is even more remarkable is that the disease distribution for both evolutionary schemes rn and sfn are quantitatively similar over a wide range of @xmath95 , and obey a power law @xmath96 .",
    "we do not have an explanation for this striking similarity , nor the value of the critical exponent .",
    "we cautiously note that while a set of four parameters uniquely determines @xmath2 , the converse is not true .",
    "in particular the characteristic features of @xmath84 ( as defined by the initial slope , the plateau value @xmath70 , average lifespan @xmath5 and crossover time from an aging to non - aging regime ) can be kept `` similar '' by holding @xmath25 constant while increasing @xmath28 , @xmath97 and @xmath26 simultaneously ( see supplementary information and fig.s.4 ) .",
    "of course , there is no a priori reason why two species with different attributes must _ necessarily _ have different aging curves .",
    "we now aim to obtain the values of initial decay rates @xmath98 , the critical vitality @xmath10 and understand why dependency networks collapse suddenly . on the way , we also hope to understand why these quantities are so similar for both scale free and random networks , and determine the origin of the gompertz - like law .    when the system is far from collapse , the probability that two providers of a single node dying at once @xmath99 $ ] is negligible compared to that of a single provider dying @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "then the total probability @xmath9 that a node dies is @xmath25 plus the probability that the last vital provider of a node dies .",
    "if @xmath101 is the probability that a node is left with one last vital provider , we can self - consistently evaluate @xmath9 @xmath102 in a single step associated with the aging of the network , the probability that a node is repaired is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the probability that a node has at least the minimum number of providers required to function .",
    "then , the change in the fraction of nodes that are alive , is given by @xmath105 where we have used the expression for @xmath9 as obtained from ( [ 0 ] ) . from ( [ 1 ] ) , we see the origin of the catastrophic ( and universal ) nature of death . for any arbitrary `` fully connected '' network and monotonically decreasing @xmath4 , the vital fraction @xmath101 must always start from a finite value in the domain @xmath106 $ ] and increases towards unity as @xmath51 decreases , inevitably to cause the first term to dominate the second ( @xmath21 ) , and thus leading to a sudden drop in the expected vitality .",
    "this is true in general , although the detailed form of the evolution of @xmath51 depends on the fraction @xmath101 of vital providers and repairable fraction @xmath104 that will vary for different network structures .    equation ( [ 1 ] ) also indicates an asymptote in longevity for large repair rates , as seen in fig[4a ] . if we set @xmath107 , we find that the system lives indefinitely when the repair rate is set to @xmath108 where @xmath109}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any given @xmath110 $ ] , i.e. for a vitality larger than the critical vitality @xmath10 . in this case",
    "the system damage increases while the vitality decreases until it reaches @xmath111 , but maintains that damage forever . of course",
    ", ( [ 1 ] ) governs the _ expectation value _ of @xmath4 which is the actual value only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath91 .",
    "thus , only a system of infinite size that satisfies ( [ 1.5 ] ) can live indefinitely , since a finite system will die ( at least ) with probability @xmath112 due to statistical fluctuations .    in general",
    ", it is a non - trivial task to obtain the exact forms of @xmath101 and @xmath104 and thence the average lifetime , the critical damage fraction etc .",
    "however we can obtain the initial slope @xmath113 with which the vitality decreases , and the critical vitality @xmath10 at which the whole system collapses ( see dashed lines in fig[1 ] ) for the case @xmath52 : let the probability that a node with @xmath29 providers die be @xmath114 .",
    "then we can recursively obtain @xmath115 in terms of the others @xcite , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the probability that the provider of a degree-1 node has @xmath36 providers .",
    "the first term corresponds to the probability that a node dies independent of its connectivity .",
    "since we neglect probabilities of order @xmath99 $ ] , initially only degree-1 nodes can be killed by the death of their providers . thus substituting @xmath118 for all k apart from @xmath119 , and using @xmath120 we can obtain from ( [ 2 ] ) the initial probability that a degree-1 node dies , @xmath121 to find the expectation value of the initial slope we must average over the damage rate of all degrees , including @xmath118 for @xmath122 @xmath123 upon substituting the numerical values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 for the networks we evolved , we obtain @xmath126 for the neutral scheme ( rn ) and @xmath127 for non - neutral ( sfn ) scheme , i.e. only a @xmath128 difference between two topologies .",
    "these initial slopes are consistent with our aging simulations ( fig[1 ] ) .",
    "to estimate the critical vitality @xmath10 , we start by asking what the smallest value of @xmath25 must be in order to kill any network in just one step .",
    "if there exist a critical vitality @xmath10 , then a death rate of @xmath129 would kill the network in one step .",
    "making this substitution and letting @xmath130 for all @xmath36 in ( [ 2 ] ) yields a simple but interesting result , @xmath131 for the networks we evolved , p(1 ) is @xmath132 for the neutral scheme and @xmath133 for the non - neutral scheme .",
    "these values are consistent with the critical vitalities we observed in our aging simulations ( fig[1 ] ) .",
    "having estimated the average damage rate and the critical vitality of the network , we now consider the nature of lifespan distributions .",
    "the probability of network survival @xmath60 is equal to the probability of @xmath134 being not greater than @xmath135 .",
    "that is , @xmath136 .",
    "since each node dies with probability @xmath9 , @xmath137 using the aging rate of the network established earlier , i.e. @xmath138 regardless of the network topology or size , i.e. @xmath9 is independent of both these parameters .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath91 the probability of death @xmath139 simply becomes a unit step function . on the other hand for finite @xmath28 ,",
    "the step function softens , and we empirically interpret the rapid transition from @xmath140 to @xmath141 as aging .",
    "we see that by passing from finite size to infinite size , we also pass from the stochastic to deterministic case , and from gradual aging to `` instant aging '' .",
    "finally , we consider the sharpness of the transition from @xmath140 to @xmath141 to see if there is any relation between our results and the classical gompertz law for mortality . evaluating ( [ 3 ] ) exactly is nontrivial , since , strictly speaking , all quantities in ( [ 3 ] ) except @xmath28 are random variables .",
    "however we can substitute the average ( early - time ) value of @xmath142 in ( [ 3 ] ) ; this is done at the cost of narrowing the longevity distributions but hopefully not their functional forms .",
    "the mortality rate @xmath143 obtained this way is plotted in supplemental fig.s.2 and agrees well with the empirical gompertz law , which states that @xmath144 increases linearly in time .",
    "we have built on a rough similarity between large networks and complex organisms ( and machines ) to create a minimal model of aging .",
    "it is thus important to be self - critical here by comparing our study both with reality and with previous attempts .",
    "any theory that aims to account for a phenomenon as universal as aging spanning both animate and inanimate objects needs to be robust , i.e. it should not have such strong assumptions and results that strongly depend on system details .",
    "the weak sensitivity of our outcomes to the details of biologically justifiable dependency network structures ( fig[1,2,3,4 ] ) seems to satisfy this requirement .",
    "however , as already pointed out , we have four parameters in our model - network size , rate of damage and repair , and the initial damage , in addition to the fraction of dependency that determines if a node dies or not ( 1/2 in our case ) .",
    "it seems unlikely that any model could be simpler , and while this is sufficient to fit a variety of mortality curves in organisms and machines , the set of these parameters is not unique for an organism . clearly , therefore",
    ", we need further constraints to make our model even more robust , and some of these may come from mechanistic limits on the parameter values .    comparing our analysis with earlier models , we note that a classical benchmark is provided by the application of reliability analysis to biological aging @xcite , which investigates the robustness of systems in which cells are connected in a parallel - series circuit ( i.e. an organ lives as long as one of its cells remains , and the organism dies as soon as one of its organs fails ) . while this picture can successfully explain some qualitative features of mortality curves , a few puzzles remain .",
    "first , it can not account for the higher infant mortality followed by a drop ( in contrast see fig[3d ] and second row of fig.s.6 ) despite introducing an initial damage .",
    "secondly , the plateau value of @xmath145 implied by the model of @xcite regardless of the number of cells per organ , is equal to @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the total number of organs .",
    "this implies that any link to actual experimental values of @xmath70 for an organism such as _ c. elegans _ , with say , @xmath148 organs , requires about ten percent of all cells die per day , an unreasonably large fraction that contradicts experiment .",
    "the final puzzle in @xcite is , the predicted functional form of @xmath2 depends very sensitively on a specific assumption of how the reliability circuit is built . specifically , the functional form of the probability distribution describing the number of `` redundant cells per organ '' which by itself seems to have no a priori or experimental justification .",
    "in contrast , our analysis of random and scale free networks is able to explain the initial increase in mortality , is consistent with `` low '' rates of cell deaths seen in experiments , and is surprisingly independent of connectivity distributions or individual realizations of networks .",
    "our analysis also differs significantly from earlier theoretical investigations of network failure @xcite in which nodes are simply removed one by one ( systematically or randomly ) until networks get fragmented . in these approaches the nodes do not influence the performance of one other , and are not allowed to be repaired .",
    "curiously , the lack of interactions in these models lead to fundamentally different fragmentation dynamics in scale free and random networks .",
    "in contrast the survival curves we observe are remarkably independent of the network topology ( fig[3,4 ] ) . the strong interactions between components may be the reason behind the strong similarity of mortality curves among so many organisms ; a conclusion that bears similarity to that of another strong - interaction model that has been proposed to explain electrical gird failures @xcite . much still remains to be done in understanding how the form of these interactions leads to differences or similarities in the dynamics .",
    "our study has focused on the dynamics of networks that age as a consequence of interdependency , and thus leads naturally to the question of how this might be controlled .",
    "since the repair rate , and perhaps the damage rate ( to a lesser extent ) are experimentally controllable , one might ask if it is possible to vary their temporal character while keeping their average constant .",
    "are there optimal strategies for repair - either in the time domain or in space ( i.e. looking at nodes with varying connectivity ) ?",
    "for example , fig[4a ] shows that if the system is repaired uniformly , the degree of repair does not make a significant difference for @xmath149",
    ". it would be very useful to know if and how a ( temporal or spatial ) non - uniform repair strategy improves lifespan . in networks that are dynamically heterogeneous",
    ", we may ask what would be the consequences of differential damage and repair in a network with highly variable turnover - e.g. a network with tissues like the skin or gut that have high damage and repair rates , and the brain which has a low damage and repair rate ? at the level of ecology and colonies , we might ask how does the aging dynamics of a dependency network change when a system consists of parts with aging rates comparable to that of the whole system ? we hope that our minimal model may be used to study some of these questions .",

    "we sharpen the lifetime distributions and hence steepen the mortality curve ; however gompertz s law is still recovered for short times ( fig.s.2 ) .",
