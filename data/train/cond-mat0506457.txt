    "theoretical interest in quantum phase transitions from superfluid to mott insulating states of bosons has recently been revived by their experimental realization in cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice.@xcite extensions of these experiments are expected to soon provide a great variety of real life toy models , where theoretical scenarios for such phase transitions can be tested.@xcite for the condensed matter community , such transitions are interesting in their own right , but also provide a simpler context in which some aspects of mott conducting - insulating transitions of _ electrons _ can be explored .",
    "a better understanding of such mott criticality generally may help to explain mysteries in various strongly correlated materials , from heavy fermion metals @xcite to cuprate superconductors,@xcite in which mott criticality may plausibly be argued to play a key role .",
    "an exciting theoretical development in the field has been the discovery that some quantum phase transitions require a fundamentally new description , not based on the now - standard landau s concept of an order parameter . instead , such quantum critical points ( qcps ) are described in terms of _ emergent _ degrees of freedom , not present in either phase and appearing due to certain special dynamically generated low - energy symmetries at the critical point.@xcite an interesting consequence of the emergent low - energy symmetry of the critical point is the near - degeneracy of `` competing ordered '' states unrelated by any _",
    "microscopic _ symmetry ( but unified with one another by the emergent one ) in the neighborhood of the quantum phase transition .",
    "there is , at present , unfortunately , no general way to _ a priori _ identify the appropriate emergent degrees of freedom , should they exist , for any putative quantum critical point .    in the particular context of two - dimensional bosonic superfluid - insulator transitions ,",
    "a general non - landau - ginzburg - wilson ( non - lgw ) framework _ has _ recently been proposed in ref .",
    "( and see ref .   for a pedagogical review ) , and carried out explicitly on the square lattice .",
    "in particular , the mott transition can be described in terms of the _ vortex _ excitations of the superfluid . in a two dimensional superfluid ,",
    "vortices are point - like `` particles '' whose creation / annihilation operators can be used to construct a quantum field theory .",
    "the vortices being non - local topological objects , these vortex fields are , however , not themselves order parameters in the lgw sense .",
    "the non - locality is manifested by the presence of a ( non - compact ) @xmath6 gauge field , to which the vortex fields are coupled in the `` dual '' vortex field theory .",
    "this formulation is general because it is based on the excitations of the _ superfluid _ , which is a stable and apparently featureless ( i.e. without broken symmetry apart from off - diagonal long range order ) state at any boson density .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown in ref .   that the vortices exhibit a subtle _ quantum order _ which _ is _ sensitive to the boson density @xmath0 ( per unit cell of the lattice ) .",
    "in particular , at non - integral @xmath0 , the vortices form non - trivial _ multiplets _ transforming under a _ projective symmetry group _ ( psg - technically , a projective representation of the lattice space group ) .",
    "the lagrange density for the vortex field theory therefore takes the general form @xmath7 + { \\cal l}_{\\rm int}[\\{\\varphi_\\ell\\ } ] \\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\frac{1}{2 e^2 }   ( \\epsilon_{\\mu \\nu \\lambda}\\partial_{\\nu } a_{\\lambda})^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 with @xmath9 are vortex fields for the @xmath10 members of the multiplet ( @xmath10 depends upon @xmath0  see sec .",
    "[ sec : dual ] ) , and @xmath11 is the dual @xmath6 gauge field .",
    "quartic and higher order terms are contained in @xmath12 , the structure of which is dictated by the psg .",
    "the mott transition is captured by eq.([eq : vft ] ) in a simple way .",
    "the ground state of @xmath13 corresponds to the vacuum of vortices  flux is expelled from the system , so this is a superfluid . in the @xmath14 phase , at least one of the vortex flavors will condense , and the gauge fields will acquire a gap by the higgs mechanism .",
    "this is indicative of a charge gap , and describes an _ incompressible _ mott insulating phase .",
    "transformations within the @xmath8 multiplet comprise the emergent symmetry operations of the `` deconfined '' quantum critical point .",
    "this structure has an important physical consequence as well : it naturally and unavoidably leads to ( particular ) broken spatial symmetries in the mott state .",
    "a mean - field analysis of the vortex field theory predicts a direct superfluid to mott transition , as well as the nature of the charge ordering in the mott phase .    in this paper",
    ", we extend this vortex field theory approach to describe superfluid to mott insulator transitions of bosons on the triangular lattice ( _ hexagonal _ lattice in proper crystallographic nomenclature ) at fractional boson fillings @xmath15 , with @xmath16 relatively prime integers .",
    "we focus particularly on the most interesting examples , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath17-filling case introduces a new ingredient not present on the square lattice : geometrical frustration .",
    "here we refer to `` charge frustration '' of the ordering of localized boson configurations in the presence of short - range repulsive interactions .",
    "a consequence  or perhaps definition  of such geometrical frustration is the exact or near degeneracy of many distinct ordered states .",
    "the similarity of this property with the emergent near - degeneracy of competing orders near a deconfined quantum critical point suggests a possible link between the two phenomena .",
    "this connection indeed appears to be borne out by the analysis in this paper .    in the simplest classical models of frustration ,",
    "the degeneracy amongst low - energy states is not only large but macroscopic ( i.e. with an entropy proportional to the sample volume ) .",
    "this classical degeneracy , when lifted by quantum fluctuations , may produce unusual ground states .",
    "a number of very recent papers@xcite  have investigated the system of hardcore bosons with nearest - neighbor interactions ( which can be mapped to a spin-@xmath17 xxz model ) on the triangular lattice near half - filling .",
    "this realizes such approximately classical frustration in the limit of very strong near - neighbor repulsion .",
    "these works demonstrated that in this system the lifting of the macroscopic classical degeneracy results in an unusual _ supersolid _ ground state , which we denote ss3 because of its 3-sublattice structure .",
    "this `` order by disorder '' mechanism is very different from the `` conventional '' ( theoretically ! ) picture of supersolidity , via a condensation of vacancies and/or interstitials in an ordered solid.@xcite    since the above studies clarified that such mott states do not occur in the simplest nearest - neighbor interaction model , it is apparent that microscopically , longer - range interactions , possibly including ring - exchange,@xcite are necessary to observe these transitions in a microscopic model . finding simple interactions that produce nontrivial insulating ground states on the triangular lattice is an important and difficult problem , that will likely require sophisticated numerical methods .",
    "we will not address this issue here ( but see the discussion , sec .",
    "[ fin ] ) .",
    "our phenomenological vortex field theory , on the contrary , describes universal aspects ( independent of microscopic realization ) of mott insulating , superfluid , and other states , and the transitions between them . as for the square lattice case ,",
    "a mean - field analysis predicts a direct superfluid - mott transition , with a diverse set of mott insulating phases . also like the square lattice , the vortex field theory has an enhanced emergent symmetry at the critical point , a hallmark of deconfined criticality . a significant difference from these prior examples of deconfined criticality , however , is that , in the frustrated case , @xmath2 , the emergent symmetry is _ nonabelian _ , containing an @xmath4 `` pseudospin '' subgroup .",
    "the much larger ( than in non - frustrated cases ) emergent symmetry can be understood physically as symptomatic of the larger near - degeneracies present in this case due to frustration .",
    "remarkably , going beyond the mean - field analysis of the vortex field theory , our approach connects very nicely to the supersolid phase of the xxz model .",
    "indeed , the supersolid order parameter  describing the growth of the supersolid state out of the featureless superfluid  appears in a particularly simple form in the vortex variables .",
    "moreover , our approach reveals an alternative view of the supersolid , as a partially - melted `` parent '' mott insulating state , with `` quantum disordered '' pseudospin .",
    "this loss of pseudospin order _ simultaneously _ with the onset of superfluidity is possible because , as we show , the pseudospin _ skyrmion _ excitation of the mott insulator carries physical boson charge .",
    "the supersolid may thereby also be viewed as a condensate of these skyrmions .",
    "furthermore , this picture leads directly to the prediction that the mott insulator to ss3 transition is described by the recently discovered non - compact cp@xmath5 ( nccp@xmath5 ) quantum critical universality class.@xcite  this transition describes the quantum disordering of a pseudospin vector @xmath18 ( the order parameter for the additional solid order of the mott state ) in @xmath19 dimensions , when `` hedgehog '' instantons are absent in space - time .",
    "these hedgehog events correspond precisely to processes which change the skyrmion number , and are therefore prohibited by charge conservation in this case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : dual ] we develop the dual vortex theory for the triangular lattice at a general rational filling .",
    "we derive the psg transformations of the degenerate low energy vortex modes and discuss some of their general properties . in sec .",
    "[ mft ] we apply this theory to the two cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and discuss the resulting mott states that are obtained by a mean field analysis of the vortex field theory . in sec .",
    "[ defects ] we present a `` hard - spin '' formulation of the vortex action , which enables a study of its phases and transitions beyond mean field theory .",
    "we discuss the new phases which arise , notably supersolids , the elementary excitations of the different states , and the transitions amongst them .",
    "this includes notably the ss3 phases and the nccp@xmath5 transitions between them and their parent mott insulator .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in sec .",
    "[ fin ] of a more microscopic physical picture for the most interesting mott and supersolid states at half - filling , the connection to the recent studies of the xxz model , and the prospects for observing more of the physics in this paper in related models .",
    "a number of appendices provide useful details of various technical results .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , our aim is to derive a field theoretic description of the vicinity of a superfluid to mott insulator transition , in terms of the vortex excitations of the superfluid state .",
    "as is well - known , lattice models of bosons can indeed be reformulated in vortex variables on the dual lattice , a technique called duality . as detailed for instance in ref .",
    "( and references therein ) , this can in principle be carried out exactly for any lattice boson hamiltonian , e.g. bose - hubbard models , xxz models , etc . unfortunately , this exact mapping does not lead to a particularly tractable limit of the vortex theory , and it is therefore difficult to extract quantitative predictions directly from the lattice vortex theory .    fortunately , we can avoid this difficulty in addressing our stated goal of understanding universal phenomena in the vicinity of the superfluid - mott quantum critical point . for this purpose , we need not specify any particular microscopic boson model . instead",
    ", we will illustrate the calculations through the use of a very simple lattice vortex theory , which is chosen to have the same spatial symmetries as the physical triangular lattice , and to exhibit a superfluid to mott insulation transition .",
    "the universal properties of interest will coincide with those of more physical microscopic boson models .    in the euclidean vortex coherent - state path integral formulation in which we work ,",

    "the action is written in terms of the complex vortex field @xmath25 ( and its conjugate @xmath26 ) which annihilates ( creates ) unit vorticity , as well as a dual gauge field @xmath27 .",
    "the physical meaning of the gauge field @xmath27 is that its curl gives ( @xmath28 times ) the bosonic 3-current density , and importantly , the temporal component of the current density is ( @xmath28 times ) the charge density . for a bosonic system with density @xmath0 bosons per site",
    ", we must therefore enforce the condition that @xmath29 flux on average passes through each hexagonal plaquette of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we will assume the filling to be rational @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are relatively prime integers , and will mostly concentrate on the two cases @xmath33 .",
    "physically , @xmath34 represents a vortex hopping amplitude , @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent short - range vortex `` core '' energies and interactions , and @xmath37 represents the strength of the dual electromagnetic field fluctuations ( it is roughly proportional to the local superfluid density away from the mott quantum critical point ) .     and",

    "( [ eq:3 ] ) for small @xmath37 , i.e. neglecting to a first approximation dual gauge fluctuations  they will however be restored at a later stage of analysis . in this limit",
    "we can treat the dual gauge field in a mean field approximation and take : @xmath39 as @xmath35 is decreased from large positive values , we expect an instability of the `` vortex vacuum '' when the energy of the lowest vortex excitation approaches zero  or equivalently , when the minimum eigenvalue of the quadratic form for @xmath40 in eq .",

    "( [ eq:3 ] ) then consists of a set of vortex fields , each representing one of these minimum energy vortex particles .",
    "we will also take the trivial continuum limit of eq.([eq:3 ] ) in the temporal direction .    because of the non - zero gauge flux through each spatial plaquette , the minimum energy multiplets are non - trivial .",
    "the form of the continuum action in this case is determined by the projective representation of the space group ( psg ) , @xcite under which the vortex fields @xmath41 transform . to find it",
    ", we must work through the consequences of some specific gauge choice .",
    "as in ref . , we will choose the landau gauge for @xmath42 .",
    "namely , let @xmath43 be the two basis vectors of the honeycomb lattice , as shown in fig.[hexlat ] ( note that the honeycomb lattice has two sites per unit cell ) .",

    "[ hexlat ] ) of the dual honeycomb lattice .",
    "landau gauge is @xmath47 and @xmath48 for all other directions ; that is , only the gauge field on vertical links is chosen non - zero .",
    "the full psg is generated by a set of unitary transformations of @xmath41 , one for each generator of the lattice space group . for the triangular lattice ,",
    "we choose the space group generators as two elementary lattice translations @xmath49 , a @xmath50 rotation with respect to site @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ hexlat ] , @xmath52 , and two reflections , @xmath53.-fold rotation about a direct lattice site , @xmath54 , is determined from these generators by the relation @xmath55 , and so is not independent . ] the psg transformations of the vortex fields , characterized by the unimodular complex number @xmath56 , are then : @xmath57 for the special case @xmath2 , in which we are principally interested , one usually considers in addition to these spatial symmetries , an extra _ particle - hole symmetry _ , which we denote @xmath58 for `` charge conjugation '' .",
    "this interchanges singly - occupied and empty sites on the direct lattice . in the spin language appropriate for hard - core bosons , this is just a @xmath59 rotation around the @xmath60 axis in spin space , which has the effect of an ising transformation @xmath61 ( and likewise for @xmath62 ) .",
    "the xxz model , and indeed any hard core boson model at @xmath2 with only pairwise interactions , possesses such a particle - hole symmetry . in the dual theory , this requires the action to be invariant under @xmath63 and simultaneous sign change of the fluctuating part of the dual gauge field @xmath64 .    the quadratic action of eq .",

    "the eigenstates of the quadratic action can therefore be characterized by their quasimomenta in the corresponding reduced brillouin zone .",
    "specifically , we introduce the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice , @xmath67 wavevectors will , when necessary , be specified by coordinates @xmath68 , with @xmath69 ( reciprocal lattice vectors correspond to @xmath70 being integral multiples of @xmath28 ) .    by applying the methods of ref .",

    "the psg transformations of the multiplet can be found using eq.([eq:9 ] ) of appendix  [ sec : psg - momentum - space ] , by a straightforward generalization of the procedure , detailed in ref .  .",

    "clearly this state has only local ( within a cluster ) charge fluctuations , consistent with incompressibility .    of course in most cases many such wavefunctions can be constructed for a mott state of a given symmetry , and moreover the true ground state wavefunction for a realistic hamiltonian will not have the direct product form .",
    "however , the above general construction can serve the purpose of providing an example of a state with the same symmetry properties as predicted by the phenomenological theory , and is expected to be in a sense ( which we do not attempt to define precisely ) adiabatically connected to all ground states in the mott phase . to our knowledge , all well - established examples of bose mott insulating ground states in the theoretical literature ( e.g. on the square lattice , checkerboard , stripe , and vbs states ) have such a construction .",
    "we therefore view the existence of such a wavefunction as a sort of consistency check on our results , and give examples in the following subsections .",

    "<S> we report on a phenomenological study of superfluid to mott insulator transitions of bosons on the triangular lattice , focusing primarily on the interplay between mott localization and geometrical charge frustration at 1/2-filling . </S>",
    "<S> a general dual vortex field theory is developed for arbitrary rational filling factors @xmath0 , based on the appropriate projective symmetry group . at the simple non - frustrated density @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we uncover an example of a deconfined quantum critical point very similar to that found on the half - filled square lattice . turning to @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is quite different . here , we find that the low - energy action describing the mott transition has an emergent nonabelian @xmath3 symmetry , not present at the microscopic level . </S>",
    "<S> this large nonabelian symmetry is directly related to the frustration - induced quasi - degeneracy between many charge - ordered states not related by microscopic symmetries . through this `` pseudospin '' @xmath4 symmetry , the charged excitations in the insulator close to the mott transition </S>",
    "<S> develop a skyrmion - like character . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an understanding of the recently discovered supersolid phase of the triangular lattice xxz model@xcite as a `` partially melted '' mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the latter picture naturally explains a number of puzzling numerical observations of the properties of this supersolid . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we predict that the nearby quantum phase transition from this supersolid to the mott insulator is in the recently - discovered non - compact cp@xmath5 critical universality class.@xcite   a description of a broad range of other mott and supersolid states , and a diverse set of quantum critical points between them , is also provided . </S>"
