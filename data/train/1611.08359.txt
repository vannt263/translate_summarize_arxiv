    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been successful in describing properties of known matter and forces to a great precision until now , but we are far from satisfied since it suffers from some problems or theoretical arguments that have not been solved yet , which follows : inclusion of gravity in gauge theory , instability of the higgs potential , cosmological puzzles of matter - antimatter asymmetry , dark matter ( dm ) , dark energy , and inflation , and flavor puzzle associated with the sm fermion mass hierarchies , their mixing patterns with the cp violating phases , and the strong cp problem .",
    "the sm therefore can not be the final answer .",
    "it is widely believed that the sm should be extended to a more fundamental underlying theory .",
    "if nature is stringy , string theory should give insight into all such fundamental problems or theoretical arguments  .",
    "as indicated in refs .",
    "@xcite  , such several fundamental challenges strongly hint that a supersymmetric hybrid inflation framework with new gauge symmetries as well as higher dimensional operators responsible for the sm flavor puzzles may be a promising way to proceed . in favor of such a new extension of the sm , axions and neutrinos could be powerful sources for the arguments , in that they stand out as their convincing physics and the variety of experimental probes .",
    "many of the outstanding mysteries of astrophysics may be hidden from our sight at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum because of absorption by matter and radiation between us and the source .",
    "so , data from a variety of observational windows , especially , through direct observations with neutrinos and axions , may be crucial .",
    "thus , the axions and neutrinos in astrophysics and cosmology could provide a natural laboratory for a new extension of sm particle physics .",
    "axions in stars available at low energies are well suited for very sensitive tests .",
    "if the axion exists , it solves the strong cp problem of qcd through the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite , fits easily into a string theoretic framework , and appears cosmologically as a form of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the axion lies at the intersection of elementary particle physics , astrophysics , cosmology and string theory , potentially playing a crucial role in each .",
    "there are being discussed two prototype axion models  , kim - shifman - vainshtein - zakharov ( ksvz )  @xcite and dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitsky ( dfsz ) models . and",
    "another new type model so - called flavored pq symmetry is appeared  @xcite .",
    "these minimal models , commonly introducing sm gauge singlet scalar fields carrying pq charges , are categorized by what couples to @xmath7 with domain - wall number @xmath8   domain - walls , and the process of axion radiation stops .",
    "if @xmath9 separating the various domains ( like in the dfsz model ) the string - wall network is stable and has a sizable surface energy density @xmath10 , which is enormously bigger than the critical density of the universe today @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an axion mass and @xmath13 is an axion decay constant . and since the energy density in these walls , @xmath14 , dissipates slowly as the universe expand and @xmath15 now would vastly exceed the closure density of the universe , this is a serious problem  ref .",

    "( iii ) the flavored pq symmetry model  @xcite couples to hadrons , photons and leptons with @xmath16 , in which the sm fermion fields as well as sm gauge singlet fields but electroweak higgs doublet fields carry pq charges .    in the case of neutrinos ,",
    "the low energies available in nuclear power plants , particle accelerators , nuclear bombs , and general atmospheric phenomena are a little bit well studied in neutrino oscillation experiments . after the observation of a non - zero mixing angle @xmath18 in the daya bay  @xcite and reno  @xcite experiments ,",
    "the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath19 and a precise measurement of the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath20 are the next observables on the agenda of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "meanwhile , the very different structure of leptonic mixings compared to the quark ones for all possible neutrino mass orderings indicates an unexpected texture of the mass matrix and may provide important clues to our understanding of the physics of fundamental constituents of matter . in some sense",
    ", our understanding of the sm fermion masses and mixing angles remains at a very primitive level . on the other hand ,",
    "high energy neutrinos are available in the most violent astrophysical sources : events like during the births , collisions , and deaths of stars , especially the explosion of supernovae , gamma - ray bursts , and cataclysmic phenomena involving black holes and neutron stars .",
    "the sm weakly interacting neutrinos , known as three different flavors @xmath21 , can deliver astrophysical information ( _ e.g. _ icecube detector  @xcite , etc ) from the edge of the universe and from deep inside the most cataclysmic high - energy processes .",
    "moreover , the observations of cosmic structures ( _ e.g. _ cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , galaxy surveys , etc . ) can give the information on the neutrino masses and the effective number of species of neutrino @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation , a cp property not yet fully understood , may play a role in the decoupling process and therefore can affect @xmath22 .",
    "additional neutrinos , if existed in nature , should be sterile with respect to the sm gauge interactions because the decay @xmath23 showed that there are only 3 species of neutrinos with ordinary weak interactions .",
    "such sterile neutrinos are light or heavy and do not participate in the weak interaction .",

    "; such neutrinos may play the role of baryogenesis via leptogensis .",
    "hence it needs a new paradigm to explain the peculiar structure of lepton sector compared to the quark one as well as the astrophysical and cosmological observations on neutrinos .",
    "since astrophysical and cosmological observations have increasingly placed tight constraints on parameters for axion , neutrino , inflation , and reheating , it is in time for a new scenario on axion and neutrino to mount an interesting challenge . in a theoretical point of view neutrino and axion",
    "physics require new gauge interactions and a set of new fields that are sm singlets .",

    "could economically explain the mass hierarchies of quarks and leptons including their peculiar mixing patterns as well as provide a neat solution to the strong cp problem and its resulting axion . here",
    "if we assume that the non - abelian discrete @xmath27 symmetry is a subgroup of a gauge symmetry , it can be protected from quantum - gravitational effects  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the model since such @xmath27 symmetry is broken completely by higher order effects , there is no residual symmetry ; so there is no room for a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry to give rise to domain - wall problem .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we construct a minimalistic susy inflationary model for quarks , leptons , and axions based on @xmath28 symmetry in a way that the mixed @xmath1-@xmath2 ^ 2 $ ] anomaly - free condition together with the sm flavor structure demands additional sterile neutrinos as well as no axionic domain - wall problem . in sec.iii",
    "we show explicitly symmetry breaking scales by considering the astrophysical constraints on star coolings , and provide model predictions on the axion mass and axion - photon coupling . and we investigate how neutrino oscillations at low energies could be connected to new oscillations available on high energy neutrinos as well as the leptogensis scenario . in turn , we explore what values of cp phase and atmospheric mixing angle in the low energy neutrino oscillation can be predicted depending on mass hierarchy of the active neutrino and mass splittings responsible for new oscillations . in addition , we examine a possibility to observe the effects of the pseudo - dirac property of neutrinos by performing astronomical - scale baseline experiments to uncover the oscillation effects of tiny mass splitting , and such possibility has the ability to distinguish between normal mass ordering and inverted one of the active neutrino mass .",
    "sec.iv is dedicated to the study of a realistic moduli stabilization in type iib string theory with positive vacuum energy , which is essential for the flavored pq axions at low energy as well as a lucid explanation for cosmological inflation at high energy scale .",
    "we discuss how the two massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) modes could survive in the phase of scalars charged under the global anomalous @xmath1 symmetry . in sec.v",
    "we provide an explanation of an extension of the supersymmetric hybrid inflation .",

    "the main focus on this section is to estimate the the reheating temperature that is required to generate sufficient lepton asymmetry following the hybrid @xmath32-term inflation . in sec.vii",
    "we show that , even the model contains two natural dm candidates , axions and neutralinos , a substantial contribution to dm relic density could be made up of the relic neutralino lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) due to a relatively low axion decay constant and a relatively low reheating temperature .",
    "what we have done is summarized in sec.viii , and we provide our conclusions .",
    "unless flavor symmetries are assumed , particle masses and mixings are generally undetermined in the sm gauge theory . in order to describe the present sm flavor puzzles associated with the fermion mass hierarchies including the large leptonic mixing angles and small quark mixing angles",
    ", we introduce the non - abelian discrete @xmath34 flavor symmetry  @xcite which is mainly responsible for the peculiar mixing patterns with an additional continuous global symmetry @xmath35 which is mainly for vacuum configuration as well as for describing mass hierarchies of leptons and quarks .",

    "a crucial observation here is that such tiny mass splittings together with the sum of neutrino masses obtained from cosmological constraints suggest a high predictability of very long wavelength oscillations as well as the non - observational @xmath446 decay rate .    *",
    "( iii ) * in the model the qcd axion originates from antisymmetric tensor gauge fields in compactified string theory , with decay constants depending on where moduli are stabilized . under the gauged anomalous @xmath464 symmetry ,",
    "the string theoretic axions , vector fields , and kahler moduli participate in the four - dimensional gs mechanism . since the three moduli all appear in the kahler potential , the three size moduli and one axionic partner with positive masses",
    "are stabilized while leaving two axions massless through non - perturbative superpotentials .",
    "the two gauged anomalous @xmath0 symmetries have the mixed @xmath465-@xmath466-@xmath466 color anomalies which are cancelled by the gs mechanism , where the gauged anomalous @xmath1 mixes with the axionic moduli and which in turn couples to a multiple of the qcd instanton density .",
    "so the string theoretic axion decay constants depend on the kahler metric .",
    "note that the existence of fi terms for the corresponding @xmath465 implies the existence of uplifting potential which makes a nearly vanishing cosmological constant and induces susy breaking . and the moduli masses do not have any relation to the gravitino mass .",
    "the two axionic directions are gauged by the @xmath0 gauge interactions associated with @xmath170-branes , and the gauged flat directions of the @xmath32-term potential are removed through the stuckelberg mechanism . below the mass scale of heavy gauge boson",
    "the gauge bosons decouple , leaving behind low energy symmetries which are anomalous global @xmath35 . in such a way , the qcd axion decay constant could be much lower than the scale of moduli stabilization when the matter fields charged under the global anomalous @xmath1 get vevs induced by tachyonic susy breaking masses .",
    "one linear combination of the global @xmath465 is broken explicitly by instantons , and such would - be qcd axions play crucial role in evolution of stars and solving the strong cp problem , as well as candidates of cdm .    *",
    "( iv ) * in order to provide a lucid explanation for inflation we have considered a realistic moduli stabilization , which is essential for the flavored pq axions at low energy .",
    "the moduli stabilization has moduli backreaction effects on the inflationary potential , in particular , the spectral index of inflaton fluctuations , which provides a lucid explanation for the cosmological inflation at high energy scale .",
    "the inflaton as a source of inflation is displaced from its minimum and whose slow - roll dynamics leads to an accelerated expansion of the early universe . during inflation",
    "the universe experiences an approximately ds phase with the inflationary hubble constant @xmath190 gev .",
    "quantum fluctuations during this phase can lead to observable signatures in cmb radiation temperature fluctuation , as the form of density perturbation , in several ways  @xcite , when they become much bigger than the hubble radius long after inflation has been completed . when interpreted in this way",
    ", inflation provides a causal mechanism to explain the observed nearly - scale invariant cmb spectrum . in the hybrid inflation model which provides intriguing links to uv - complete theories like string theory ,",
    "the pq scalar fields @xmath467 play a role of the waterfall fields , that is , the pq phase transition takes place during inflation such that the pq scale @xmath278 is fixed by the amplitude of the primordial curvature perturbation and turns out to be of order @xmath468 gev . in the present model ,",
    "since susy breaking is transmitted by gravity , all scalar fields acquire an effective mass of the order of the expansion rate during inflation .",
    "so we expect that the inflaton acquires a mass of order the hubble constant @xmath197 , and which in turn indicates that the soft susy breaking mass ( the inflaton mass @xmath469 ) during inflation strongly depends on the scale of waterfall fields by vevs @xmath470 and @xmath471 induced by tachyonic susy breaking masses .",
    "thus such moduli stabilization with the moduli backreaction effects on the inflationary potential leads to the energy scale of inflation in a way that the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation and the scalar spectral index are to be well fitted with the wmap observation .",
    "since the moduli masses are much larger than inflaton mass and accordingly are quickly stabilized to their minima at finite moduli fields values separated by high barrier from the runaway direction during inflation without perturbing the inflaton dynamics , the height of the barrier protecting metastable minkowski space are independent of the gravitino mass hence @xmath197 is also independent of the gravitino mass .",
    "the moduli - induced slope partially cancels the slope of the coleman - weinberg potential , which flattens the inflationary trajectory and reduces the distances in field space corresponding to the @xmath472 @xmath473-folds of inflation .",
    "* ( v ) * we have shown that a successful leptogenesis scenario could be naturally implemented through ad mechanism .",
    "the interaction between the ad fields and inflaton generates the potential for @xmath170-flat direction , and which in turn produces coherent oscillations along the supersymmetric flat directions , leading to dynamics in field space that ultimately breaks cp and baryon number .",
    "the tiny mass splittings suggested from new neutrino oscillations strongly indicate the existence of lepton - number violation , which is a crucial ingredient of the present leptogenesis scenario .",
    "the ad fields have large vevs along the flat directions during inflation in the early universe , in turn which together with the hubble scale @xmath197 during inflation provide a lower bound on the tiny mass splittings for the new neutrino oscillations .",
    "the resultant baryon asymmetry is constrained by the cosmological observable ( the sum of light neutrino masses ) as well as the high energy neutrino oscillations .",
    "the ad fields start their coherent oscillations after the inflation ends and they create a large net lepton asymmetry , which is finally transferred to matter particles when they eventually decay .",
    "in addition to the dependence on the cosmological observable as well as new neutrino oscillations along with high energy cosmic events , the resultant baryon asymmetry crucially depends on the reheating temperature of the inflation , which is suppressed for relatively high reheating temperatures .",
    "the tiny mass splittings responsible for new oscillations require a relatively low reheating temperature , @xmath6 tev , which essential to avoid the well - known gravitino overproduction problem as well as to explain the bau , @xmath474  @xcite .",
    "even this consideration on a relatively low reheating temperature puts severe limits on the size of the renormalizable superpotential coupling of the model , this small coupling is tied to a successful leptogenesis and ckm mixing matrix .",
    "thus , it is very attractive that the bau is predicted almost around the reheating temperature less than tev scale .    *",
    "( vi ) * in the present flavored pq model naturally implementing a hybrid inflation , the qcd axion and the lightest neutralino charged under the stabilizing symmetry @xmath37 could become components of dm . since the contribution of axion to dm abundance depends strongly on its mass ( or the scale of the @xmath1 symmetry breakdown ) as well as the fate of the @xmath1 symmetry during and after inflation , along with the successful inflation and leptogenesis the axion contribution to the cdm relic abundance is estimated as just at most a few percent once the qcd axion mass ( or its decay constant @xmath13 ) is fixed via stellar evolutions .",
    "after inflation the large potential energy of the inflaton field is transformed into the kinetic energy of newly produced particles in thermal and chemical equilibrium . during reheating stage , the faster expansion is driven by the entropy production due to inflaton decay and it goes on until the inflaton decay completes .",
    "we are in the reheating temperature @xmath6 tev after inflation , which is lower than the freeze out temperature of the neutralinos .",
    "then the relic abundance of lsp dm could be reduced , and relaxes the strong constraint coming from the requirement that the universe does not overclose .",
    "we have shown that a substantial contribution to dm relic density could be made up of the relic neutralino lightest supersymmetric particle under the reheating temperature lower than the freeze - out temperature of the neutralinos .",

    "<S> motivated by the flavored peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry for unifying flavor physics and string theory , we construct an explicit model by introducing an @xmath0 symmetry as a fundamental one for rather recent but fast growing issues of astro - particle physics and cosmology , in a way that the @xmath1-@xmath2 ^ 2 $ ] anomaly - free condition with the standard model ( sm ) flavor structure demands additional sterile neutrinos as well as no axionic domain - wall problem , encompassing several main issues connected to each other : leptonic mixings and cp violation in neutrino oscillation , high - energy neutrinos , qcd axion , axion cooling of stars , inflation , cosmological constant , leptogenesis , and dark matter ( dm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd axion decay constant , through its connection to the astrophysical constraints of stellar evolution and the sm fermion masses , is shown to be fixed at @xmath3 gev ( consequently , its mass @xmath4 mev and axion - photon coupling @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how neutrino oscillations at low energies could be connected to new oscillations available on high energy neutrinos , connected by the inflation and leptogenesis scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a relatively low reheating temperature , @xmath6 tev , is essential to avoid the gravitino problem and to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via affleck - dine mechanism . in order to provide a lucid explanation for inflation we consider a realistic moduli stabilization ( essential for the flavored pq axions at low energy ) with moduli backreaction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that a substantial contribution to dm relic density could be made up of the relic lightest neutralino under the reheating temperature lower than the freeze - out temperature of that .    </S>",
