    "in recent years , an ever increasing number of papers have been devoted to the study of so - called `` negative '' materials having negative coefficients of thermal expansion @xcite . in 1996",
    "the research team led by john evans published the paper @xcite in which a negative coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) was found for the @xmath5 ceramics in a wide range of temperatures from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . later many other compounds with similar properties , named negative thermal expansion ( nte ) materials ,",
    "have been discovered @xcite .",
    "these materials with unusual properties are interesting not only theoretically , but also from an industrial standpoint .",
    "materials with controlled thermal expansion can find several practical applications , such as switches and sensors , while materials with zero thermal expansion in a wide temperature range will be used in high - precision engineering . in instrument - making industry materials with strictly regulated values of linear cte in specified temperature ranges of operation",
    "are in great demand .",
    "recently the evans team has created a material whose properties can be controlled throughout the thermal expansion range : from positive through zero to negative cte @xcite .",
    "the composite oxide @xmath8 is a well studied compound distinguished by a negative cte , whereas the tin - containing analog of this cubic material , @xmath9 , expands when heated .",
    "the authors of that paper state also to have demonstrated the possibility of introducing various amounts of zirconium into the lattice so that the obtained ceramic material can have a positive , negative or zero cte .",
    "in essence the `` positive '' nature of the tin - containing material is balanced by `` negative '' zirconium , both metals being key elements of the same crystalline structure .",
    "additionally , in refs.@xcite it was shown by inelastic neutron scattering that in nte structures a softening is observed in the vdos curve . thus a negative thermal expansion coefficient is observed in materials which are in a metastable state ( for example , near a structural transition ) , have a strongly anharmonic character of interatomic interaction , and/or a softening of the phonon modes is evidenced in the vdos curve , which results in a negative value of the grneisen parameter .",
    "zirconium is known to be a strongly anharmonic metal .",
    "as we see , it plays a decisive role in the formation of negative cte in the nte structures .",
    "we believe , then , that the study of the thermal expansion of zr nanofilms is an important task , because elucidation of the dependence of linear cte on the temperature and film thickness will make it possible to reveal the peculiarities of the formation of thermodynamical properties of nanofilms and draw some conclusions about the influence of the surface structure on their properties .",
    "clarification of the nature of special physical features of nanosystems is of interest for both fundamental problems of the condensed matter physics and possible practical applications .",
    "earlier @xcite , we constructed a phase diagram temperature - thickness for zirconium films .",
    "this diagram presents the regions of final structures stable for no less than 1 ns , one time step being equal to 1 fs .",
    "here we should mention some important points .",
    "firstly , the size effect was detected .",
    "two characteristic sizes may be noted .",
    "the first one is of 5 unit cells ( @xmath10 ) : up to this size the film just falls apart , and the second critical size is the film thickness of @xmath11 unit cells ( @xmath12 ) at which the mechanism and sequence of structural transformations change : from this size on the @xmath0 ( 001 ) film remains stable in a sertain temperature range .",
    "secondly , what is especially important , structures not observed in pure zr in the usual bulk state were found .",
    "these are @xmath1 and orthorhombic structures .",
    "recall that at atmospheric pressure only two phases are observed in zr bulk samples : a high - temperature @xmath0 phase , and an @xmath13 phase found below @xmath14 .",
    "thus , zirconium provides a possibility of studying the properties of a strongly anharmonic material existing in both stable and metastable states , in conditions close to structural transformations .",
    "the molecular dynamics method makes it possible to determine the linear cte in different crystallographic directions , namely , in the direction normal to the film surface , and in the plane of the film atomic layers , which allows the study of the film thermal expansion anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , this method enables the investigation of physical characteristics , such as the lattice dynamics , separately for the surface and interior atomic layers of the film . in this work",
    "the md method is used to study the peculiarities of thermal expansion of the zirconium thin films with cubic ( @xmath15 ) crystal structures for different crystallographic orientations of the surface at a constant zero pressure .",
    "we also performed a comparison of the temperature behavior of the lattice parameters and vibrational density of states of surface and interior atomic layers , polarized both in the film plane and in the direction normal to the film surface .",
    "the physical characteristics of zirconium films were studied by the md method using the standard xmd package @xcite .",
    "the many - body potential ( # 2 ) from ref.@xcite constructed within the embedded atom model @xcite was chosen to describe the interatomic interaction in zirconium . in ref.@xcite it was shown that this potential allows one to obtain , to a high degree of accuracy , the @xmath0 and @xmath13 lattice parameters of zirconium , cohesive energy , elastic constants , melting temperature , and other physical characteristics .",
    "the bulk phonon dispersion curves calculated with this potential along the symmetrical directions of the brillouin zone of @xmath0 zirconium at different temperatures were obtained in our paper @xcite .",
    "a comparison with the experimental data shows that the potential chosen allows one to reproduce the experimentally observed features of the zr phonon spectrum including the softening of the transverse n - phonon with decreasing temperature , and so it may be successfully used in calculating vibrational and thermal characteristics of zirconium films .    in this paper",
    "we present only the vibrational density of states for bulk zirconium ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) as compared with the experiment @xcite .",
    "the total vdos , g(@xmath16 ) , was calculated as the fourier transform of the autocorrelation velocity function , the velocity was averaged over all atoms on an interval of 10 ps after a relaxation period of 100 ps at a given temperature :    @xmath17    here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the velocities of the @xmath20-th atom at time @xmath21 and the initial time , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 denotes the averaging over time and the sum is taken over all atoms . for the calculation of the local vdos ( for example , the surface atoms vdos ) in the sum were considered only the velocities of the surface layer atoms .",
    "the local vdos then were multiplied by the weight coefficient . to obtain the polarized vdos all the velocities",
    "were multiplied by the polarization vector @xmath24 in calculating the autocorrelation function :    @xmath25    as seen from fig.[fig1 ] , the positions of the main peaks are in good agreement with the experiment .    in calculating the lattice parameters , the coordinates of all the crystallite atoms",
    "were first averaged over a time interval of 50 ps , then the average values were taken over the atomic layer , thereafter the distance between the atomic layers in the given direction @xmath26 was found .",
    "note that in calculating the interlayer distance along the @xmath27 axis the near - surface layers ( 5 layers below the surface on each side ) were excluded from consideration because of the fact that after relaxation near the film surface significant deviations from the interlayer distance values in the film interior are observed .",
    "the coefficients of thermal expansion were calculated as follows :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the film cte ; @xmath30 is the average volume per atom only in the film interior at the initial temperature ; @xmath31 is the relative change of this volume on heating the crystallite by @xmath32 degrees . for the calculation of the linear cte from our simulation we used the following expression :    @xmath33    here",
    "@xmath34 is the linear cte in the direction normal to the film plane along the @xmath27 axis ; @xmath35 are the linear cte in the film plane along the @xmath36 and @xmath37 axes ; @xmath38 is the average distance between the atomic layers at the initial temperature along the direction chosen ; @xmath39 is the relative change of this distance on heating the crystallite by @xmath32 degrees .",
    "note at once that the lattice cubic symmetry in @xmath0 and @xmath1 films changes after relaxation to tetragonal . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath0 films turn into @xmath2 , and @xmath1 into @xmath3 ones .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents the lattice parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 averaged over 50 ps for films of different thickness indicated on the abscissa in unit cells ( u.c . ) of the corresponding structures . for @xmath3 films",
    "the calculation was performed at @xmath42 ( fig.[fig2](a ) ) , and for @xmath2 films at @xmath43 ( fig.[fig2](b ) ) .",
    "the statistical error was @xmath44 @xmath45 at @xmath46 and @xmath47  at @xmath48 .",
    "the lattice parameters for @xmath3 films with ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) crystallographic orientations are rather close in magnitude , while for @xmath2 ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) films they differ significantly .",
    "the @xmath2 ( 001 ) film is stabilized only from a thickness of 17 unit cells ( @xmath49 ) . in the same figure",
    "are shown the experimental lattice parameters obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite ( 4.61@xmath45 indicated by black square ) , and ref.@xcite ( 4.63@xmath45 indicated by black point ) for @xmath1 films , and in ref.@xcite ( 3.609@xmath45 ) for a bulk @xmath0 zirconium structure ( fig.[fig2](b ) ) .",
    "the tetragonal distortion parameter , @xmath50 , decreases with increasing film thickness . for @xmath3 films it varies from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "the tetragonality of @xmath3 zirconium films was also observed experimentally @xcite with a tetragonal distortion parameter @xmath50 equal to @xmath53    the thickness has a determining effect on various properties of the films , which is due to their structural peculiarities and the arising mechanical stresses .",
    "we calculated the averaged distances between atomic layers in films of different thickness along the direction normal to the film plane , i.e. from one free surface to the other .",
    "the size of the basic crystallite along the @xmath36 and @xmath37 axes in all cases was equal to 24 u.c .",
    "the @xmath2 films were considered at @xmath54 , and the @xmath3 ones at @xmath55 .    as shown by the calculations , significant variations in the average distance between atomic layers",
    "are observed in the interface regions of all films after relaxation .",
    "these areas with strong distortions were eliminated from further calculations of the lattice parameters and , accordingly , of the coefficients of thermal expansion . in all the cases considered ,",
    "five interlayer intervals were assigned to the interface region . in calculating the lattice parameters under changes of temperature ,",
    "only the values obtained for the film interiors were taken into consideration . in this way",
    "the lattice parameters of @xmath2 and @xmath3 films with crystallographic orientations ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) were calculated at different temperatures . at the same time",
    ", we calculated and analyzed the distribution of the total and local vibrational densities of states and their temperature dependences in order to determine the extent to which the structural stability of @xmath2 and @xmath3 zr films is affected by the interior and surface vibrations .",
    "to this end the surface atomic layers were separated out and all calculations were performed separately for surface and interior atomic layers .",
    "the top panels of fig.[fig3 ] present the vibrational density of states for @xmath2 films with ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) surface orientation , and the bottom panels for @xmath3 films with the same surface orientation . as can be seen , for the @xmath2 ( 001 ) film",
    "all surface vibrations marked by the red line are in the low - frequency region , which is indicative of the dynamic instability of the surface , while for the film with ( 110 ) surface these vibrations are uniformly blurred throughout the frequency range pointing to the dynamic stability of the surface . in both cases vdos for the whole film",
    "are practically identical .",
    "returning to the phase diagram temperature - thickness @xcite , we can assume that the critical size of 17 u.c ( 6.1 nm ) is due to the fact that with an increase of the film thickness the proportion of surface atoms decreases and so does the contribution from the surface vibration modes .",
    "as a result the film with ( 001 ) surface becomes energetically more favorable , whereas calculations of the @xmath0 lattice energy at @xmath56 showed the ( 110 ) film to be energetically favorable for all the film thicknesses ( see fig.6 in ref.@xcite ) .    in the @xmath3(001 )",
    "film surface vibrations give a small contribution to the high - frequency region too , while in the @xmath3(110 ) film all surface vibration modes are concentrated in the low - energy region .",
    "our calculations on heating the films show the @xmath3(001 ) film to be stable over a wider temperature range : it undergoes structural transformation only at @xmath57 , whereas the @xmath3(110 ) film even at @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the results of calculation of the local polarized vdos for surface atoms of a @xmath3(001 ) film of thickness @xmath59 as a function of the temperature indicated on the right . here",
    "one can see noticeable shifts of the low - frequency peaks from the energy value of @xmath60 to @xmath61 for local vdos along both @xmath36 and @xmath37 axes . at the same time",
    "the contribution of high - frequency ( about @xmath62 ) vibrations polarized along these axes substantially decreases .",
    "the position of the peak corresponding to the surface atom displacements along the @xmath27 axis on heating first shifts slightly to the region of higher energies , and starting from the temperature @xmath63 this peak shifts in the opposite direction .",
    "this behavior , in our opinion , is due to changes in interlayer distances in the interface region . at low temperatures oscillations of the interlayer distances",
    "are observed , whereas with increasing temperature these oscillations disappear , and all distances between the atomic layers in the interface region ( 5 atomic layers from the surface ) increase .",
    "just such a reconstruction occurs around @xmath64 . before the structural transformation ( at @xmath65 )",
    "all the atomic layers in the near - surface area are spaced apart at larger intervals than the layers of the film interior .",
    "the results of the local polarized vdos calculation for surface atoms of a @xmath3 ( 110 ) film are presented in fig.[fig5 ] : here the shift of the low - frequency peaks is clearly observed only in one direction along the @xmath36 axis .",
    "note that different nature of the atomic layer displacement in the @xmath3 ( 110 ) and ( 001 ) films leads to the formation of different structures .",
    "the @xmath3 ( 110 ) film transforms into an @xmath13 ( 0001 ) at @xmath58 , and the @xmath3 ( 001 ) film into a @xmath0 ( 110 ) one at a temperature of @xmath57 .",
    "note also that on heating the oscillations of interlayer distances persist in the @xmath3 ( 110 ) film up to the temperature of structural transition .",
    "we also calculated the temperature dependences of the lattice parameters @xmath66 , and @xmath41 of @xmath3 films 20 u.c .",
    "thick ( see fig.[fig6 ] ) .",
    "red color shows the changes in the @xmath3(001 ) lattice parameters .",
    "one can see that the parameter @xmath41 increases with temperature , while @xmath67 and @xmath68 decrease equally in the whole temperature range considered . in the @xmath3(110 )",
    "film ( blue color ) only the parameter @xmath67 decreases , whereas @xmath68 and @xmath41 grow .",
    "also were calculated the temperature dependences of the local vdos polarized along the @xmath69 , and @xmath27 axes for both all interior atomic layers of @xmath3 films and only two interior layers .",
    "however , no shift of vibrational modes to the low - energy region was detected in either case .",
    "thus , for metastable films with @xmath3 structure there is a clear correlation between the temperature behavior of the surface atom vibrations and the lattice parameters .",
    "analogous vdos calculations were performed for @xmath2 zirconium films of thickness @xmath70 with ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) surface orientation . in the @xmath2(110 ) film , on heating , all the lattice parameters @xmath71 increase , and no softening of vibrational modes is observed in the temperature behavior of the local phonon densities polarized along the @xmath72 directions for both surface and interior atomic layers . in the @xmath2(001 )",
    "film , when heated from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , all the lattice parameters also increase , but on further heating to @xmath75 ( i.e. as the boundary of the structural reorientation transition is approached ) a slight decrease in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 parameters is observed , though the parameter @xmath41 continues growing . as seen from the phase diagram temperature - thickness @xcite , the @xmath2 ( 001 ) film of thickness @xmath76 is stable in the temperature range from @xmath73 to @xmath75 , and at temperatures above @xmath75 it undergoes an orientational transformation into @xmath2 ( 110 ) .",
    "the decrease in the @xmath77 lattice parameters of the @xmath2(001 ) film in the range @xmath78 may be associated with stresses that arise in these directions resulting in a structural transformation .",
    "as mentioned above , in the @xmath2 ( 001 ) film the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 first increase and then ( from @xmath74 on ) decrease .",
    "the appearance of such two - dimensional stresses in the @xmath2 ( 001 ) film with an increase in temperature results in structural instability .",
    "it is obvious that such changes in the lattice parameters result in nonlinear variation the coefficients of thermal expansion for films , as opposed to bulk samples in which these coefficients vary linearly . in fig.[fig7](a ) are presented the cte for the zirconium films @xmath2 ( 001 ) ( red ) and @xmath2 ( 110 ) ( green ) .",
    "the figure also shows the cte calculated for a @xmath0 crystallite with cyclic boundary conditions ( grey ) and the experimental data for a bulk zr sample from ref .",
    "@xcite ( black ) . as seen from the figure , the calculated and experimental cte values for the `` bulk '' case are in good agreement .",
    "the linear coefficients of thermal expansion for @xmath2 ( 110 ) and ( 001 ) films are presented in fig.[fig7 ] : @xmath34 along the direction normal to the film plane ( b ) ; @xmath35 for the @xmath2 ( 110 ) film ( c ) ; the same coefficients for the @xmath2 ( 001 ) film ( d ) .",
    "the temperature dependences of the linear cte were also calculated for the @xmath3 zirconium films . in fig.[fig8 ] the linear cte are shown for the films @xmath3 ( 001 ) ( red ) and @xmath3 ( 110 ) ( blue ) : @xmath34 along the normal to the film plane ( a ) ; @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the film plane(b ) .    the @xmath3 ( 001 ) film has negative coefficients of linear expansion along the axes parallel to the film plane over the whole temperature range considered . in the @xmath3 ( 110 )",
    "film the linear cte is negative only along the @xmath36 axis , and along the @xmath37 direction it is positive .",
    "note that the @xmath3 ( 110 ) film becomes unstable even at @xmath54 , there occurs a transition into an @xmath13 structure .",
    "the change of volume per atom in the film interior is shown in fig.[fig8](c ) as a function of the temperature . in both films",
    "the volume increases owing to a more rapid growth of the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the temperature dependences of cte are presented in fig.[fig8](d ) for the @xmath3 films ( 001 ) ( red ) and ( 110 ) ( blue ) .",
    "thus , calculations of the coefficients of thermal expansion and linear cte for zirconium films from the molecular dynamics simulation show that for the stable @xmath2 ( 110 ) film all cte are positive throughout the temperature interval investigated .",
    "the linear cte of the @xmath2(001 ) film in the film plane are alternating - sign , the sign being changed to negative just before the structural transformation .",
    "for metastable @xmath3 ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) films cte remain positive , but their behavior depends substantially on the film surface orientation . at high temperature",
    "the coefficient is of essentially nonlinear character for the @xmath3 ( 001 ) film , and also for the @xmath3 ( 110 ) film the cte curve exhibits a hump . in the whole temperature range",
    "the linear cte @xmath79 and @xmath80 are negative for the @xmath3 ( 001 ) film , whereas for @xmath3 ( 110 ) only the coefficient @xmath79 is negative , and @xmath80 is greater than zero .",
    "the calculation of the total and local vibrational densities of states polarized along the axes @xmath72 as a function of temperature for the surface and interior layers of @xmath2 ( stable ) and @xmath3 ( metastable ) zirconium films has shown a correlation between the vdos of surface atomic layers and the anisotropy of the lattice parameters variation with temperature .",
    "for example , in ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) @xmath3 zr films the decrease of the lattice parameters with increasing temperature is due to the `` softening '' of low - frequency peaks in the vdos curves .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that at temperatures close to that of the structural transition the zirconium films can also exhibit negative linear coefficients of thermal expansion .",
    "it is known that the negative cte observed in bulk samples of composite materials ( ceramics , alloys ) either are associated with vibrations of bridging oxygen ( me - o - me ) [ 1 ] , or they arise in highly anisotropic layered structures as a result of the membrane effect [ 20 ] . in the case of zirconium",
    "thin films neither mechanism of the appearance of negative linear cte is feasible , firstly , because of the lack of light atoms necessary for the bridging mechanism , and secondly , the existing anisotropy of interaction between the atoms in the film plane and in the direction normal to the plane does not suffice for the membrane effect to arise .",
    "thus , the reasons for the appearance of negative coefficients of linear thermal expansion in zirconium films require further investigation .",
