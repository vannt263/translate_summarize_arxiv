    "microquasars are typically binary systems consisting of a normal ( non - degenerate ) star from which material is pulled into an accretion disk around a black hole ( bh ) companion , though in some cases the accreting object may be a neutron star ( ns ; see @xcite for a review of microquasars ) . these objects may be considered as scaled down versions of extra - galactic quasars as they appear to share similar properties .",
    "they emit at a wide range of frequencies from radio through gamma - ray , where the emission at different energies is often correlated through disk - jet interactions @xcite . the accretion disk in microquasars can be fed from roche - lobe overflow of the companion @xcite or from dense the stellar winds of a massive secondary star @xcite .",
    "the objects cyg x-1 and cyg x-3 are known microquasars and high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) . while cyg x-1 is known to harbor a 15 @xmath7 bh @xcite , the nature of the compact object in cyg x-3 is remains open , though some evidence suggests a 2  5 @xmath7 bh companion @xcite .",
    "both systems have been shown to emit gamma - ray flares @xcite , with some evidence for orbital modulation in cyg x-3 @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray emission is associated with the soft x - ray state in cyg x-3 @xcite , the hard x - ray state in cyg x-1 @xcite , with heightened radio emission in both .",
    "another class of objects are the gamma - ray binaries of which five are known : ls i + 61303 , ls 5039 , psr b1259 - 63 , hess j0632 + 057 , and 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 @xcite .",
    "these objects exhibit high - energy spectra that peak at gev and tev energies , in contrast to x - ray binaries whose spectra at kev energies .",
    "it is suspected that the compact companions of gamma - ray binary systems are ns and that the gamma - ray emission arises from the colliding pulsar and stellar winds @xcite .",
    "however , gamma - ray emision may also arise from the interaction between a clumpy stellar wind and the jet produced by a microquasar @xcite .    in 2010 ,",
    "the _ agile _  satellite @xcite detected a gamma - ray flare with a flux of @xmath8 ph  @xmath1  s@xmath2  ( @xmath9100 mev ) with a significance greater than @xmath10 from a previously unknown source , agl  j2241 + 4454  @xcite .",
    "the location of the flare coincides with a known be star , hd  215227  ( = mwc 656 ; @xcite ) , whose binary nature was elicited only after the discovery of the gamma - ray flare @xcite .",
    "this began speculation that agl  j2241 + 4454  could be the sixth identified gamma - ray binary .",
    "@xcite performed an analysis of _ fermi _  data and found upper limits ( 90% c.l . ) of @xmath11 ph  @xmath1  s@xmath2  for the 3.5-year average flux and @xmath12 ph  @xmath1  s@xmath2  for the flare .",

    "the measured orbital period of 60.37 days and be star mass of 1016 @xmath7 yield a bh mass of 3.86.9 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "hd  215227  has also been identified as a source of x - ray emission by @xcite , who find a non - thermal x - ray luminosity @xmath14 erg  s@xmath2 corresponding to @xmath15 for a 3.86.9 @xmath16  bh , consistent with the previously found upper limit of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this low luminosity is in stark contrast to cyg x-1 , which has an @xmath18 erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the system was in a quiescent state at the time of the x - ray observations .",
    "while there is a strong contrast at x - ray energies , neither cyg x-1 nor agl  j2241 + 4454  show evidence for sustained gamma - ray emission , but have both been detected as gamma - ray flares by _ agile _  @xcite .",
    "three separate _ agile _",
    "detections of cyg x-1 were confirmed as low - significance counterparts in _ fermi _  data @xcite .",
    "the highest significance detections were more likely to be found during transitional stages , perhaps coinciding with jet formation or destruction .    the low x - ray and radio flux from hd  215227  places near the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) a  0620 - 003 ( @xmath20 erg  s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) on the well - formed radio / x - ray luminosity relation @xcite .",

    "as mentioned earlier , one possible explanation is that 16.8 hrs of on - source time for the lat was insufficient despite the flare s luminosity . to test this possibility , we ran a likelihood analysis on the source ls  i  + 61  303 , which has an average flux of @xmath47 ph  @xmath1  s@xmath2  @xcite , comparable to that of agl  j2241 + 4454 .",

    "may at least rule out the possibility that the photons were of too low energy for _ fermi _  to detect .    in any case",
    ", it appears that the proposed gamma - ray source agl  j2241 + 4454  does not fit within the category of known gamma - ray binaries such as ls 5039 or ls  i  + 61  303 .",
