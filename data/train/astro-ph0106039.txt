    "black hole soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) sources are a sub - class of low mass x - ray binaries occasionally undergoing dramatic outbursts . from a dim quiescent state",
    "they brighten ( in the opt / uv / x/@xmath2-ray bands ) by several orders of magnitude in the course of a few days , and then decline , with roughly exponential dependence of x - ray flux on time ( see tanaka & lewin 1995 ; tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ; chen , shrader & livio 1997 for reviews ) .",
    "the outbursts are thought to be caused by a sudden increase of mass accretion rate onto the central object as a result of the disc instability due to hydrogen ionization .",
    "the basic mechanism is thus the same as in dwarf novae ( e.g. osaki 1996 ) , but with important differences due to larger and more massive accretion discs and the intense x - ray irradiation in sxt ( cannizzo 1993 ; king & ritter 1998 ) .",
    "black hole sxt are perfect laboratories to study the accretion process .",
    "black holes are simpler accretors than neutron stars or white dwarfs thanks to the lack of global magnetic field and a hard surface . during an outburst and following",
    "decline the mass accretion rate changes by several orders of magnitude , giving data on how the accretion processes change as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "results from sxt studies can then be applied to other systems with accretion onto black holes , e.g.  active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "if similar outbursts take place in agn , they can not be observed in progress due to much longer ( factor of @xmath4@xmath5 ) time scales ( burderi , king , & szuszkiewicz 1998 ; siemiginowska , czerny , & kostyunin 1996 ) .",
    "previous investigations of both black hole and neutron star sxt led to identification of a number of distinct spectral / temporal states ( see e.g. tanaka & lewin 1995 ; van der klis 1995 for reviews ) : ( 1 ) quiescence state , when the sources are very dim ( @xmath6 ) , with ( poorly constrained ) power law spectra , ( 2 ) low / hard state , ( ls ) characterized by a hard , roughly power law spectrum ( photon index @xmath7 ) and a strong x - ray variability ( r.m.s .",
    "2030 per cent ) , with power spectral density ( psd ) peaking at @xmath8 hz ; ( 3 ) intermediate state ( is ) , when the power law component is somewhat softer ( @xmath9 ) and a weak soft , thermal component appears in the spectrum ; ( 4 ) high / soft ( hs ) state with x - ray spectra dominated by a thermal component of temperature @xmath1 kev and psd of rather low amplitude ( a few per cent ) and a power law shape ; ( 5 ) very high state ( vhs ) when both the soft , thermal ( @xmath10 kev ) and the hard power law components ( @xmath11 ) are present in the spectrum , and similarly the psd is a mixture of psds characteristic to ls and hs . additionally , quasi - periodic oscillations of various frequency ( 110 hz ) and strength appear in psd in this state . for the purpose of this work",
    "the is , hs and vhs are referred to as soft states , since it is in these states that a strong soft , thermal component is present in the spectra .",
    "both the directly observed fluxes and temporal sequence of occurrence of these states during sxt s decline leave little doubt that the accretion rate is lowest in quiescence and increasing through ls , is , hs to vhs .",
    "a general scenario for the evolution of accretion flow in sxt as a function of accretion rate was presented by esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ) .",
    "they suggested that the most characteristic feature of the evolution during the decline  the high to low state transition  involves a major change of the flow geometry .",
    "an optically thick , thermally emitting accretion disc dominant in soft states is replaced by a hot , optically thin(ish ) flow able to produce the strong , hard x - ray emission seen in the low state by thermal comptonization ( e.g.  gierlinski et al .",
    "the transition presumably involves evaporation of the optically thick disc ( e.g.meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; raska & czerny 2000 ) , whose inner radius increases from the last stable orbit at @xmath12 in the high state to @xmath13 in the low state ( @xmath14 is the gravitational radius ) .",
    "one way to track the optically thick accretion disc is through reflection of the hard x  ray spectrum by the accretion disc .",
    "the reflected component consists of the compton reflected continuum with spectral features due to iron k shell absorption and fluorescence imprinted on it ( lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola & piro 1991 ) .",
    "when the reprocessing matter forms a disc rotating in a deep potential well , the spectral features are broadened and smeared by doppler effects and gravitational redshift ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ; ross , fabian & brandt 1996 ) . the observed spectral features between 69 kev can be fit by such models and the derived amount of reflection and relativistic smearing is consistent with the disc inner edge moving inwards as the ls makes a transition to the is / hs / vhs ( ycki , done & smith 1998 ; gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 2000 ) .",
    "however , the amount of reflection and smearing seen in the ls generally precludes the disc being as far away as @xmath15 as in the simplest versions of the truncated disc models ( esin et al .",
    ", 1997 ) , and instead requires that the optically thick material extends down to @xmath16 ( ycki , done & smith 1997 ; 1998 ; 1999a ; miller et al .",
    "while a ( somewhat modified ) truncated disc model can then fit the ls data , this is not a unique interpretation : the disc could extend down to the last stable orbit if there is complex ionization structure in the disc and/or relativistic outflow of the hard x  ray emitting plasma ( see done 2001 for review and the discussion in di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ) .    at higher luminosities ,",
    "in the is / hs / vhs the spectrum is dominated by the soft component from the accretion disc ( e.g.  ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ) as expected in the esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) model , but this co  exists ( especially in the vhs ) with a hard x  ray tail .",
    "this tail is probably produced by non ",
    "thermal comptonization ( coppi 1999 ; gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) as it can extend without a break to a few hundred kev ( grove et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the ratio of luminosities in the hard and soft components can assume a broad range of values , from @xmath0 where the spectrum is pure disc emission to @xmath1 with equal luminosities in the disc and x  ray hot phase ( ebisawa et al.1994 ; homan et al .",
    "2001 ; rutledge et al .  1999",
    "; sobczak et al .   2000 ) . as well as the continuum ,",
    "iron spectral features at 510 kev are again usually observed in the spectra ( ebisawa et al .",
    "they are interpreted as indicating reprocessing of hard x  ray radiation by an optically thick accretion disc , but detailed reflection models are not often fit to the data .",
    "a common spectral model is of a disc blackbody ( mitsuda et al .  1984 ) and",
    "power law continuum with a broad iron line and smeared edge to phenomenologically model the reflected spectrum from the disc .",
    "while this model gives a rough idea of the ratio of soft to hard luminosity , it has some obvious drawbacks .",
    "firstly , the disc spectrum presumably provides the seed photons for the compton upscattering , so the hard spectrum can not extend as an unbroken power law into the disc blackbody spectrum .",
    "a power law continuum overestimates the contribution of the hard continuum at soft energies , and so this suppresses and distorts the derived soft component .",
    "also , a true reflected spectrum contains a continuum as well as spectral features .",
    "neglecting the continuum distorts the derived power law spectral index .",
    "the few papers which have modelled the reflected spectrum show unambiguously that the reprocessing medium in sxt in the is / hs and vhs is highly ionized ( ycki et al .  1998 ;",
    "miller et al .",
    "2001 ; wilson & done 2001 ) , unlike the ls where it is mainly neutral .",
    "smearing of the reflected spectral features is observed in all spectral states ( ycki et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999a ; miller et al .  2001",
    "; wilson & done 2001 ) .",
    "if the physics of the accretion flow really is controlled predominantly by @xmath17 , then the sxt spectra should be the same as those in the persistent x ",
    "ray sources at similar accretion rates .",
    "the most thoroughly studied soft state so far  in cyg x1 ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 )  shows all the above listed features : non - thermal comptonization as the origin of the hard x  rays , and the ionized and smeared reprocessed component .",
    "additionally , it conclusively shows that the continuum is not well modelled by a single disc blackbody spectrum which is comptonized by a non  thermal electron distribution .",
    "additional low temperature comptonization of the disc spectrum is _ required _ by the data ( gierliski et al .  1999 ;",
    "coppi 1999 ) .",
    "in this paper we re - analyse some of the archival and data of sxts in the soft states .",
    "we show that in most cases the spectra _ can not _ be described by a physically motivated model of a simple ( disc)blackbody emission , with a comptonized power law tail which is reflected by the accretion disc . similarly to the hs cyg x1 spectrum described above , the soft component _ requires _ a broader spectral form than that of a disc blackbody ( even including relativistic corrections ) .",
    "this could be due to additional thermal comptonization in the disc , or to a separate blackbody component from x  ray heated hot spots on the disc .",
    "the poor fit of the disc blackbody model is contrary to most results derived from phenomenological models of the hard component and spectral features ( power law plus broad line and/or smeared edge ) which generally give adequate fits to the data , and on the few occasions where they did not ( e.g.  ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ) , then the evident problems in the modeling made any inference about the soft component shape unconvincing .",
    "the phenomenological models for the spectral features have more free parameters than the physically motivated reflected spectral models , and so can compensate for difficulties in the continuum model .",
    "we demonstrate that when the spectral features at 69 kev are modelled as x  ray reprocessing , the reprocessor is strongly ionized , as expected for a disc at temperature @xmath18 kev .",
    "we analyse large area counter ( lac ) data of gs  1124 - 68 ( nova muscae 1991 ) and gs  2000 + 25 .",
    "_ ginga _ data are still some of the best to study spectra with strong soft components , thanks to its broad band energy coverage from @xmath19 kev .",
    "the data were re - extracted from ledas public archive at leicester university .",
    "the background was subtracted according to the universal procedure based on blank sky observations ( hayashida et al .",
    "1989 ) . whenever the source counts contaminated the surplus above the upper discriminator ( sud ) monitor , we first recovered the original sud values using procedure described in ycki et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , and then applied the universal background subtraction .",
    "we assume 0.5 per cent systematic errors in the data .",
    "this is motivated by the uncertainty in lac response from fits to the crab spectrum ( turner et al .  1989 ) , as well as the residual uncertainty in the determination of the lac background ( hayashida et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "we note that for data from instruments like _ ginga_/lac or _",
    "rxte_/pca the systematic error is often the dominant error up to about 10 kev .",
    "its value then has a direct influence on the @xmath20 values obtained .",
    "while this makes the absolute value of @xmath20 and the confidence contours on fit parameters lose their usual statistical meaning , the @xmath20 values do preserve the ranking of models .",
    "since some of our best fits have @xmath20 substantially less than 1 , it suggests that the assumed systematic error may be somewhat overestimated .",
    "the data ( pca top layer only , detectors 0 , 1 and 2 only ) were extracted from public archive at heasarc / gsfc , and reduced with ftools ver .  4.2 software .",
    "the background was estimated employing the latest background models appropriate for bright sources ( the sky - vle model for epoch 3 of observations ) .",
    "systematic errors of 1 per cent were assumed in each data channel .",
    "the data we model here were previously analysed by ebisawa ( 1991 ) and ebisawa et al .",
    "they used the phenomenological model of a disc blackbody ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) plus a power law with smeared edge and broad gaussian line near 6 - 8 kev . here",
    "we model the spectral features using the rel - repr model ( ycki et al.1999a ) .",
    "the model uses the angle - dependent green s functions for the problem of compton reflection as computed by magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ; as implemented in xspec models pexrav / pexriv ) , to find the reflected continuum for a given primary continuum .",
    "the fe k@xmath21 line is computed as in ycki & czerny ( 1994 ) , with photo - ionization computations as in done et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and is then added to the reflected continuum , so that the properties of the reflected continuum and the line are computed consistently for a given ionization state , inclination and elemental abundances .",
    "relativistic and kinematic corrections are then applied by convolving the spectrum with the the appropriate green s function for schwarzschild metric , using the prescription of fabian et al .",
    "the final model thus have three main parameters : ( 1 ) the ionization parameter , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the irradiating flux in 5 ev  19 kev band and",
    "@xmath24 is the hydrogen number density , ( 2 ) the overall amplitude ( normalized to the underlying continuum ) , which is equivalent to the solid angle of the reprocessor as visible from the x  ray source normalized to @xmath25 , @xmath26 and ( 3 ) the inner disc radius , @xmath27 determining the relativistic smearing of the spectral features ( the irradiation emissivity is assumed @xmath28 , ycki et al .",
    "all radii are given in units of the gravitational radius ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we note that pexriv and rel - repr are based on computations of irradiated discs with constant density . in more advanced computations with hydrostatic equilibrium , the thermal instability of x  ray irradiated plasma plays a role , and leads to a more complex vertical structure , with important observational consequences ( raska & czerny 1996 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ) .",
    "however , the thermal instability is probably unimportant for the soft state spectra in sxt s as the thermal equilibrium curve ( the ionization parameter  temperature , @xmath30@xmath31 diagram ) degenerates since its lower stable branch is at high disc temperature @xmath32 kev .",
    "the soft spectrum dominates the spectrum , so the compton temperature is not much higher than @xmath33 and the instability is suppressed .",
    "we use two analytical models approximating the inverse - compton spectra : thcomp , based on solution of the kompaneets equation ( zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz 1996 ) and comptt ( titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "we check whether our conclusions may be affected by the approximate character of the comptonization models , using the compps comptonization model ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ) , which finds a numerical solution of the comptonization problem for optically thin ( @xmath34 ) plasma explicitly considering successive scattering orders .",
    "this code can be used with a variety of electron energy distributions , including a purely thermal distribution , a purely non - thermal one or a hybrid electron distribution , i.e.   a maxwellian distribution with a power law tail above certain lorenz factor , @xmath35 ( coppi 1999 ) .",
    "such a hybrid electron distribution can provide a good description of x ",
    "ray/@xmath2-ray spectra of cyg x1 in the soft state ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) as compton scattering of the disc blackbody by the thermal part of the electron distribution provides an additional , broad soft component while the x  ray power law is produced by compton scattering of the disc photons by the non  thermal electron tail .",
    "the soft component will be modelled by the diskbb model ( mitsuda et al .  1984 ) .",
    "we will also use a general relativistic disc spectrum model grad , which integrates black body spectra over disc radius , taking into account : the colour temperature correction ( constant with radius ) at @xmath36 ( shimura & takahara 1995 ) , fully relativistic radial dependence of disc temperature in schwarzschild metric ( kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 ) and kinematic / relativistic effects on photons propagation , using the method of fabian et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . a similar model for the kerr metric , with the black hole spin @xmath37 will be also used . here",
    "we employ the radial effective temperature prescription from kato et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the colour temperature correction constant with radius , while the photon propagation is done by convolving the local spectra with the transfer function of laor ( 1991 ) , as implemented in xspec .",
    "we note that the colour temperature correction to a blackbody spectrum is appropriate when the escaping photons undergo saturated comptonization .",
    "we use xspec ver .",
    "10 for all spectral fits ( arnaud 1996 ) , with the above non  standard models implemented as local models .",
    "photoelectric absorption is modelled using wabs ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , and parameter errors are given as @xmath38 .",
    "first , we analyse a number of datasets of various sources obtained when the sources were about to make a transition from high state to low state .",
    "we refer to them as intermediate state data .",

    "the resulting fits are good ( model f : table  [ tab : gs2000_2 ] ) , with the disc blackbody temperature at @xmath39 kev , with a higher temperature for the additional blackbody at @xmath40 kev .",
    "the broadness of the soft component _ can not _",
    "be simply attributed to relativistic effects : the grad model , which includes these effects , does not provide a good description of our data .",
    "the @xmath41 values shown in table  [ tab : gs2000_2 ] are usually even worse for the grad model ( model g ) than for the simple disc blackbody ( model c ) . in these",
    "fits the inner disc radius has been fixed at the marginally stable orbit at @xmath42 .",
    "the fits can be improved if @xmath27 is a free parameters , in which case @xmath27 usually increases to @xmath43 .",
    "the relativistic effects are not important then , and the model is equivalent to diskbb .",
    "the data clearly require a presence of the reprocessed component . to illustrate its significance we removed this component from the double comptonization model ( model d ) , and fit parameters of the two continua , including @xmath44 for the first component and @xmath45 .",
    "this resulted in bad fits , as given as model 0 in table  [ tab : gs2000_2 ] .",
    "the derived parameters for the reprocessed component are similar to those previously inferred for soft states of black hole systems ( ycki et al .",
    "1998 ; gierliski et al .  1999 ) : the main features are that the reprocessor is highly ionized and it requires further smearing / broadening compared to predictions of the simple model .",
    "this is demonstrated in table  [ tab : gs2000_3 ] , where we show parameters of the reprocessed component , as obtained from fitting model d to the nov 5 , oct 18 and sep 8 datasets .",
    "we model the smearing as due to relativistic and kinematic effects , but spectral features can be additionally significantly broadened by compton down- and upscattering , as the photons diffuse through the ionized disc layers ( e.g.  ross , fabian & young 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 as determined from our fits is likely to represent the lower limit on the inner radius of the reflecting disc .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of gs  2000 + 25 is rather low , if the distance to the source @xmath46 kpc ( callahan et al .",
    "1996 ) is adopted .",

    "is , hs and vhs spectra the assumed spectral model consisted of a disc blackbody emission , a power law , a smeared edge and a gaussian line near 59 kev .",
    "of these , the edge and the line are the least accurate representation of the underlying physical processes .",
    "we replace them with a more physical model of x - ray reprocessing by an optically thick plasma .",
    "also , a power law is an inaccurate approximation to comptonized emission at energies close to the seed photons as true comptonized spectra have a low energy cutoff . in the soft spectral states",
    "the seed photons from the disc are within the observed bandpass , so such effects become important .",
    "two results from the above data analyses seem to be robust : firstly , the soft component _ can not _ be adequately described by the simple disc blackbody model and , secondly , the reprocessed component is present in the data , it is strongly ionized and smeared .",
    "the complexity of the soft component is not merely an artifact of using the approximate diskbb model . including the torque - free boundary condition , colour temperature and relativistic effects in photon propagation does not substantially change the overall shape of the spectrum ,",
    "although the derived model parameters can be significantly different ( e.g.  ebisawa 1991 ; gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ; merloni , fabian & ross 1999 ) .",
    "direct fitting of our relativistic disc model grad , which includes the corrections , supports our claim . although the best fits are somewhat better than the model employing diskbb , they are much worse than fits employing comptonized black body .",
    "similarly , using the kerr metric disc emission model did not provide better description of the spectrum of gro  j1655 - 40 compared to the simple disc blackbody model .",
    "the soft component is substantially broader than optically thick disc models , irrespective of relativistic corrections .    using the or data we are not able to differentiate between various possible modifications of the disc blackbody spectrum which ensure a good description of data .",
    "the two main possibilities are additional comptonization of the disc emission or an additional blackbody component .",
    "we discuss each of these in turn .",
    "one possibility to explain the complex shape of the soft component is to assume that it is a sum of a disc blackbody and additional blackbody emission , indicating that some fraction of the disc material is heated to rather higher temperatures .",
    "physically we might expect this if the hard x  ray power law arises from magnetic reconnection .",
    "the regions of the disc below the intense flares are then heated by the irradiating flux and the thermalized ( non  reflected ) radiation would be emitted as a quasi ",
    "blackbody spectrum at temperatures somewhat higher than the mean disc emission ( haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) . alternatively , for a central source geometry , the inner disc is additionally heated by irradiation . in all these models the additional blackbody is powered ultimately by the hard component .",
    "energetically this is certainly feasible for the is spectra .",
    "consider , for example , the gs  1124 - 68 may 18th data .",
    "the bolometric ( 0.011000 kev ) flux from this model is ( in units of @xmath186 ) : @xmath187 , the hard x  ray flux is @xmath188 , while the flux in the additional blackbody is @xmath189 .",
    "the reprocessor albedo is observed to be @xmath190 ( ionization of @xmath191 , so that fexxv and fexxvi are the dominant ionization stages of iron ) .",
    "thus the thermalized fraction is expected to be @xmath192 . given the uncertainties in the modeling this is probably consistent with the observed fraction @xmath193 .",
    "the observed flux @xmath194 at @xmath195 kev implies an emitting area @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "this gives a tiny area , @xmath198 , assuming distance @xmath199 kpc , @xmath200 and neglecting the colour temperature correction .",
    "this is consistent with magnetic flare illumination , if the illuminating area is small , i.e.  if the flares are located not too high above the disc ( nayakshin & kazanas 2001 ) . in the central source geometry the distribution of irradiation flux is somewhat steeper than @xmath201 close to the inner disc radius ( see fig .",
    "a2 in ycki et al .",
    "this gives an excess of emission , if modelled by the diskbb model , but the excess is not sufficient to account for the observed shape of the soft component .",
    "partial overlap between the central source and the disc might solve the problem .    however , the soft component is overwhelmingly dominant in the hs spectra and reprocessing of the very small hard x  ray flux is not consistent with the flux required for the additional blackbody .",
    "an extreme example here is the hs gs  1124 - 68 march 18th dataset , where the hard x  ray ( @xmath150 kev ) flux is less than 1 per cent of the total flux , while the additional blackbody component contains @xmath202 of the total flux .",
    "the situation is not so extreme for the vhs spectra , where there is some hard x  ray emission .",
    "the observed fluxes of hard x ",
    "rays are rather smaller than the fluxes of the additional blackbody components , which rules out the possibility of the blackbody being the thermalized hard x  ray illumination , if isotropic emission of the latter is assumed . the peak spectrum of gs  1124 - 68 ( jan 16th ; sec  [ sec : jan16 ] ) is a good example here : the fluxes in the 0.01@xmath203 kev band ( in units of @xmath204 ) are : @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 . if the hard",
    "x  rays were beamed towards the disc , both the thermalized emission and the reprocessed component would be enhanced .",
    "the amplitude @xmath209 is not always well constained in vhs data due to complex continuum curvature ; for example for the jan 16th data @xmath210 , while for the feb 13th @xmath211 .",
    "the two - component description of the disc emission does not seem appropriate for the brighter spectra , especially those lacking a strong hard component .",
    "the additional comptonization of the disc emission provides an alternative description to those ( and all other ) spectra .",
    "the parameters of the comptonizing plasma are not well constrained , but generally a cool , @xmath212 kev , optically thick , @xmath213 , plasma gives the best fit .",
    "the main difference between this and the same spectral index comptonization from a hotter , optically thinner plasma is in the possible contribution of the seed photons to the final spectrum for @xmath214 .",
    "however , this subtle difference is not sufficient to uniquely select the best fit solution , given the rather poor energy resolution and low energy bandpass of the data used here .",
    "we can envision a number possibilities for the origin of the comptonization of disc emission .",
    "the soft photons from the disc interior can be comptonized as they escape through a hot , ionized topmost layer of the disc .",
    "if the comptonizing layer is heated by external irradiation only , i.e.  viscous heating is negligible , its maximum temperature is the inverse compton temperature , @xmath215 , at which compton heating is balanced by compton cooling .",
    "this temperature can be estimated from @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the radiation energy density , and @xmath218 is the klein ",
    "nishina cross section . for a spectrum consisting of a strong soft component and a steep power law , @xmath215 is not much larger than the temperature of the soft component .",
    "for example , for the may 18th data of gs  1124 - 68 we calculate @xmath219 kev , and similar values are obtained for the other is spectra .",
    "this is lower than the inferred temperature of the comptonizing plasmas , implying that there _ must _ be additional heating of the plasma through e.g.  viscous dissipation ( janiuk , czerny & madejski , 2001 ) . only for the 11th jan spectrum of gs  1124 - 68",
    "is @xmath220 kev comparable to the required @xmath44 of the comptonizing plasma .",
    "this picture then implies a three - phased accretion scenario : the hot , @xmath221 kev , plasma with the comptonization parameter @xmath222 , producing the hard x  ray continuum ; the warm , @xmath22310 kev plasma with @xmath224 , responsible for the additional comptonization of the disc emission ; and the optically thick , cold , @xmath2251 kev disc .",
    "a similar accretion scenario was also suggested for the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  5548 ( magdziarz et al .",
    "the clear soft x - ray excess component in that object could be well modelled by a comptonization of accretion disc photons in a warm ( @xmath226 ev ) , optically thick ( @xmath227 ) plasma .",
    "magdziarz et al .",
    "speculated that the plasma could form a transition region between the outer , cold accretion disc and the inner hot flow .",
    "similar comptonized soft x  ray excesses are present in two narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies : pg  1211 - 143 ( janiuk et al .  2001 ) , and pks  0558 - 504 ( obrien et al .  2001 ) .",
    "a possible analogy of such three - phased configuration around accreting black holes with the solar corona was suggested by zhang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "however , the warm plasma can not form a continuous later covering the cold disc .",
    "it is optically thick and completely ionized so would produce no spectral features , contrary to results of our data analyses .",
    "more robust ( given the uncertainties in optical depth and temperature ) arguments against such a geometry are provided by considering the energy balance between the cool disc and warm skin . following the approach of haardt & maraschi ( 1991 )",
    ", the energy balance can be written as    @xmath228    while for the warm skin @xmath229 where @xmath230 the fraction of energy dissipated in the warm skin ( disc dissipation @xmath231 ) , @xmath232 is the fraction of comptonized emission returning to the cold disc , @xmath233 is the comptonization amplification factor , @xmath234 , and all the fluxes are normalized to the total gravitational energy dissipated in the two layers . solving eq .",

    "this , in turn , implies @xmath230 very close to 1 , i.e.  the entire energy dissipation in the warm skin , with the cold disc merely reprocessing and thermalizing the intercepted radiation .",
    "the situation is analogous to that with a continuous hot corona overlapping an optically thick disc ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ) .",
    "even in the extreme case of @xmath239 the produced spectra are not harder than @xmath240 , because the geometry alone implies @xmath241 .",
    "any harder spectra imply e.g.  a patchy corona , coronal outflow , etc .",
    "( e.g.  stern et al .",
    "1995 ; beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "a possible solution to the reprocessed features problem is to assume that the scattering layer appears only in the inner part of the disc , close to the radius of maximum effective temperature .",
    "the reprocessing features could then be produced further out , where the temperature is lower enabling iron to recombine to h- and he - like ions , as observed .",
    "the relativistic smearing of the iron features , usually corresponding to @xmath242 supports this possibility .",
    "another possibility for the comptonization of the soft photons is to assume a hybrid , thermal / non - thermal distribution of electron energies in an accretion disc corona ( see coppi 1999 for extensive discussion of relevant physical processes ) .",
    "the harder power law spectrum extending above @xmath243 kev would then be a result of single inverse compton upscattering of the disc photons by energetic electrons from the power law tail of the distribution .",
    "the comptonized tail of the soft component is a result of scattering of the photons by the low energy electrons , with roughly maxwellian distribution .",
    "such model was successfully applied to the soft state data of cyg x-1 ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) , where the soft component shows a clear excess above a disc blackbody component , while the hard power law extends without a break to at least 1 mev ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ) . fitting the compps comptonization model ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ) with such hybrid electron distribution we found that indeed it provides a good description of some of the spectra : the is spectra of all three analysed objects",
    "are well described by it , as well as some vhs spectra : the peak spectrum of gs  1124 - 68 and the spectrum of gro  j1655 - 40 . on the other hand , we were not able to find an acceptable description of the jan 11 and feb 13 of gs  1124 - 68 with this model .",
    "yet another possibility for the comptonization of soft photons is a weak , accreting corona , similar to that studied by witt , czerny & ycki ( 1997 ) , and janiuk , ycki & czerny ( 2000 ) . in these models the disc ",
    "corona transition is governed by the condition of thermal equilibrium between the two phases of accreting plasma .",
    "this results in a rather weak corona , dissipating up to @xmath244 per cent of gravitational energy .",
    "details of the solution depend upon the role of advective energy transfer ( compare solutions in janiuk & czerny 2000 and janiuk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but generally the corona is optically thin , @xmath245 and its temperature varies between @xmath246 kev at @xmath247 to 150 kev further away .",
    "the resulting spectra are rather steep and roughly match the comptonized excesses in the is spectra , but such a weak corona would not be able to account for the strong comptonization observed in e.g.  jan 16th spectrum of gs  1124 - 68 . the model can not account for the origin of the hard component seen in is and vhs .",

    "rays by an optically thick plasma ( compton reflection , photo - absorption , fluorescent and recombination emission ) is the standard interpretation of these features .",
    "it has been tested on numerous spectra of all kind of accreting objects , although most of the modeling work has been done with low / hard state spectra .",
    "the problem with soft states spectra is the complicated shape of the continuum emission near 510 kev , where the soft and hard component contribute roughly equally . in our work",
    "we do see that the parameters of the reprocessed component in the soft states spectra are dependent on the continuum model adopted .",
    "however , two results are robust from the work done so far :    * the very presence of the reprocessed component , i.e.  we have not been able to find a continuum description that would make the reprocessed component unnecessary , * high level of ionization of the reprocessor : again , irrespectively of the continuum model , the reprocessing features correspond to highly ionized plasma , where most abundant fe ions are more strongly ionized than fexvi ( m - shell electrons removed ) , and in most cases the he- and h - like ions .",
    "the third result is that the spectral features are further broadened and smeared compared to predictions of the simple model .",
    "we model the smearing as the relativistic doppler effect and gravitational redshift , but it has to be kept in mind that comptonization in the reprocessor is quite significant , especially for strong ionization ( e.g.  ross et al .",
    "therefore the quantitative determinations of the inner radius of the reprocessing accretion disc may be overestimated .",
    "a potential alternative to the reprocessing scenario might be absorption / emission in winds which are almost certainly launched from the vicinity of central objects accreting at @xmath248 close to the eddington limit ( e.g.  proga 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the characteristic p - cygni emission / absorption profiles might turn out to be compatible with the data .",
    "this idea has not been explored in any details and its quantitative tests are not possible at present , as the spectral predictions of the models are not ready yet to be quantitatively confronted with the data .",
    "= 0.45    one potential problem that might affect our conclusions is that the computations of the reflected continuum used in the rel - repr model ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) assume that the only x  ray absorption process is the photo - electric absorption .",
    "however , the density in accretion discs around stellar mass black holes is high enough for the free - free process to become important .",
    "another way of formulating the problem is to notice that  by the very definition of a soft state  the x ",
    "rays at @xmath249 kev are thermalized .",
    "if so , then the reflected continuum could have a rather different shape at low energies than that used in our model .",
    "precise computations of the reflected continuum in such conditions are not possible at present , as no photo - ionization code can handle densities @xmath250 and thermalization of incident x  rays .",
    "we can however estimate whether the incident x  rays at @xmath251 kev are likely to be thermalized or not . solving the vertical structure of an @xmath252 disc around @xmath253 black hole at @xmath254 ( see e.g.  raska et al .",
    "1999 ) we find the h number density at the disc equator @xmath255 .",
    "we compute the free  free absorption cross - section ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) as a function of energy for a number of values of gas temperature and density .",
    "the results , plotted as the effective absorption , @xmath256 in units of the thomson cross section as a function of energy , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffkapeff ] .",
    "since the effective absorption coefficient is smaller than 1 for @xmath257 kev , the incident x  rays will not be thermalized in the uppermost @xmath258 layer , where compton reflection takes place . thus the adopted model for the compton reflected continuum is appropriate .",
    "perhaps the most puzzling behaviour of sxts , in the context of the @xmath128-discs model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , is the strong soft thermal emission observed when the sources radiate at a significant fraction of the eddington luminosity , when the @xmath259-discs are unstable ( kato et al .",
    "1998 ) , and so perhaps they should not exist . on the other hand ,",
    "these discs are stable for low @xmath50 ( ls ) when , observationally , they seem not to be present in the central regions of gbh . while the latter problem seems to have found its solution in the mechanism of disc evaporation ( raska & czerny 2000 and references therein ) , the former one is far from any satisfactory explanation .",
    "here we construct the @xmath3@xmath260 ( accretion rate  surface density ) diagram and mark the position of gs  1124 - 68 , to quantitatively demonstrate the extent of the instability .",
    "this extends studies done by gierliski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who argued that in the soft state of cyg  x-1 the accretion disc could remain on the stable branch , down to the last stable orbit . however , we note that the soft state of cyg x-1 seems to correspond to an intermediate state of gs  2000 + 25 or gs  1124 - 68 rather than a true high state , since its bolometric luminosity is rather low , only @xmath261 ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) , not much higher than a typical low state luminosity ( zhang et al .  1997b ; di salvo et al .",
    "we estimated the bolometric luminosities of gs  1124 - 68 from models using either disc blackbody or comptonized disc blackbody spectra , which should give an upper limit to the bolometric correction .",
    "we further assumed a @xmath262 black hole at @xmath199 kpc .",
    "since the largest value of @xmath263 found in literature is @xmath264 kpc ( esin et al .",
    "1997 ) , the uncertainty of @xmath265 should be less than factor of 2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : smdot ] shows positions of the source on the @xmath3@xmath260 diagram , demonstrating that the disc was stable in ls , but it was unstable ( at least in some inner region ) whenever the source was observed in a soft state .",
    "one might then speculate that the result of the instability is a slight reconfiguration of the disc , so that the disc emission is still optically thick , but with the additional comptonization in some warm plasma .",
    "there is a number of instabilities operating in radiation pressure dominated discs ( kato et al .",
    "1998 ; gammie 1998 ; blaes & socrates 2000 ) , and it is possible that their outcome may be a clumpy accretion flow ( krolik 1998 ) . on the other hand , the amplitude of the soft component sees to be constant during the part of the decline when the spectral state is soft ( ebisawa 1991 ) , indicating that the covering factor of the clumps can not to be low , so that the disc effectively looks continuous .",
    "= 0.45    the highest luminosity spectra seem to need rather different parameters of the comptonization compared to the is spectra .",
    "perhaps , the disc structure changes when the disc solution is located on the upper stable branch ( so called slim discs : optically thick , with advective cooling ; abramowicz et al.1988 ) .",
    "alternatively , if the viscous heating scales with the gas pressure rather than the total ( gas plus radiation ) pressure then the instability is avoided ( stella & rosner 1984 ) .",
    "while such a scaling might be expected for an mhd dynamo origin of the viscosity ( stella & rosner 1984 ) , this has not yet been confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "an interesting alternative viscosity prescription is implied by hydrodynamic experiments on rotating flows ( richard & zahn 1999 ) . for a keplerian disc ,",
    "the viscosity can be written as @xmath266 , where @xmath267 is the distance from the rotation axis and the coefficient @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is the reynolds number .",
    "this prescription gives disc solutions that are both thermally and viscously stable ( hur , richard & zahn 2001 ) .",
    "we model the spectra of soft x  ray transients in soft states using more physical models for the emission .",
    "we use reflection models as opposed to phenomenological broad line / smeared edge features , and comptonization models which include the low energy cutoff at the seed photons as opposed to a continuous power law .",
    "we find that the strong soft component can not be described by simple disc models ( disc blackbody with colour temperature and/or relativistic corrections ) .",
    "there is additional broadening of the soft emission , indicating the presence of intermediate ( between the cool main disc and the hot x  ray plasma ) temperature material .",
    "this can be modelled either as an additional blackbody , or as additional comptonization",
    ". both could be plausibly present .",
    "magnetic reconnection above the disc could produce an x  ray heated spot underneath the flare , and/or the electrons in the flare itself may have a hybrid distribution , with a thermal tail at low energies which additionally comptonizes the disc emission as well as a non  thermal power law to give the hard x  ray flux . alternatively ( additionally ? )",
    "there could be a warm skin over the inner disc which comptonizes the highest temperature emission from the disc .",
    "an ionized reflected component is _ always _ detected irrespective of the detailed model used to describe the soft component .",
