    "polaritonics is a rapidly developing branch of science lying at the intersection of the physics of semiconductors , quantum mechanics and nonlinear optics .",
    "the interest in this field has been stimulated by a series of fascinating experimental and theoretical discoveries , which demonstrate that a variety of quantum collective phenomena can be observed in polariton systems including : bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite and superfluidity  @xcite ; the josephson effect  @xcite ; and the formation of various topological excitations such as vortices  @xcite and solitons  @xcite , as well as other spatial patterns  @xcite .",
    "while most fundamental studies have been performed at low temperature , experiments in gan  @xcite , zno  @xcite and organic  @xcite microcavities demonstrate devices working at room temperature .",
    "now it becomes obvious , that polaritonics has a huge potential for technological applications  @xcite .",
    "polaritonics stems from the proposal that quantum microcavities can be used as efficient sources of thz radiation  @xcite , which needs efficient pumping of the 2p excitonic state .",
    "it can not be excited under single photon absorption due to optical selection rules . in one of the recent publications",
    "@xcite , some theoretical aspects of thz radiation emission under two - photon excitation were considered .",
    "the consideration was based on the master equation approach .",
    "the two - photon absorption and thz emission were investigated as incoherent processes .",
    "this kind of consideration , however , is not always applicable .",
    "one can imagine the situation when the two - photon transition is tuned in resonance with the energy of the confined electromagnetic mode of a cavity .",
    "in this case , the coupling is of resonant character and the theoretical description should be performed along another route .",
    "theoretical consideration of this regime is the subject of the present paper .",
    "we consider a cavity which is subject to two - photon resonant excitation , in which takes place , pumping of the dark ( 2p ) exciton state . instead of considering the strong coupling between near resonant photons and 1s excitons  @xcite",
    ", we uncover a different kind of exciton - polariton generated by the non - linear coupling of photon pairs with 2p excitons .",
    "similiar to the conventional case , a characteristic splitting of the photoluminescence spectrum is observed .",
    "however , the value of the rabi splitting now becomes dependent on the intensity of the pump due to the nonlinear nature of the two photon absorption .",
    "this nonlinearity also results in the onset of bistable behavior .",
    "we consider the following geometry ( fig .",
    "1 ) : a quantum well ( qw ) with 2p excitonic transition having energy @xmath0 placed inside a planar microcavity supporting the photonic mode of energy @xmath1 . in this configuration",
    "the cavity mode can resonantly interact with the 2p excitonic state .",
    "excitonic state can be excited by two photons(red curves ) with energy @xmath2 each . ]",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads :    @xmath3    where the operators @xmath4 correspond to 2p dark excitons and photons respectively and satisfy bosonic commutation relations .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( 1 ) describe free excitons and photons and the last term corresponds to the resonant interaction between them , where @xmath5 is the two photon - exciton coupling constant calculated in appendix using second - order perturbation theory :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a quantization area of the sample ; @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the free electron , effective and reduced exciton masses , respectively ; @xmath11 is the elementary charge of the electron ; @xmath12 is the band gap of the material ; @xmath13 is the energy of the photon ; @xmath14 are the eigenvalues of the 2d hydrogen atom ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are normalized angular and radial eigenfunctions of the 2d hydrogen atom , which are written explicitly in the appendix , eqs .",
    "( 30 ) and ( 31 ) , respectively , and @xmath18 is the vector potential , which can be writen in the dipole approximation :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are vacuum and material permitivities ; @xmath22 is the length of the cavity .",
    "note , that the hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) commutes with the excitations number operator @xmath23 , that means that the eigenvectors of these two operators coincide and the hilbert space of the problem can be represented as a direct product of the manifolds corresponding to given numbers of @xmath24 .",
    "each manifold consists of @xmath25 basis vectors : @xmath26 for even @xmath24 and @xmath27 for odd @xmath24 . here",
    "the first number in kets corresponds to the number of photons , and the second number to the number of 2p excitons .",
    "the matrix element of hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) between any two vectors belonging to manifolds with different @xmath24 is zero .",
    "this means that determination of the spectrum of the problem consists in diagonalization of @xmath28 matrices , each of which has a finite size .    for @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "the result is trivial and the corresponding energies are @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "the cases of @xmath33 are also straightforward to consider , as the size of the reduced hamiltonian for the manifold is 2@xmath342 in these cases : @xmath35 and the eigenenergies in the case of resonance @xmath36 are @xmath37 consideration of the states with larger numbers of photons requires diagonalization of matrices of higher size .",
    "the energy spectrum is represented in fig .",
    "2(a ) .",
    "and the photon energy is @xmath1 .",
    "possible transitions for @xmath38 manifolds for the ideal cavity are represented on the right side of the figure ( a ) .",
    "( b ) emission spectrum of the system .",
    "the intensity of transitions from individual levels is presented by the blue lines .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath39 and the average number of the excitations in the system @xmath40 and the statistics of photons is poissonian . including a lorentzian broadening of each transition line ,",
    "gives the double peak spectrum of emission shown by the red curve .",
    "we consider broadening equals @xmath41 .",
    "one can define the value of the rabi splitting in the system as the distance between the two peaks . ]",
    "if the mirrors of the cavity are not perfect and some photons tunnel through them , the system can emit in the outside world .",
    "the spectrum of emission is determined by the energy distances between the levels corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath42 manifolds and the intensities of the transitions will be proportional to squares of the matrix elements of the photon annihilation operator @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is an initial wavefunction in the manifold with n cavity photons and @xmath45 is a final wavefunction in the manifold with ( n-1 ) cavity photons .",
    "@xmath46 represents the probability of occupation of the initial state @xcite .",
    "likewise assume that the number of excitations in the system is sufficiently to apply the central limit theorem .",
    "in this case the occupation of states with different numbers of particles is described by a poisson distribution : @xmath47 figure  2(b ) shows the total photoluminescence emission spectrum .",
    "it is well - known , that in the case of one photon and a resonant 1s bright exciton in a standard semiconductor microcavity the energy splitting does not depend on the occupation number and equals @xmath48 , if @xmath49 is the bright exciton- single photon coupling strength .",
    "considering our system with two - photon absorption for large @xmath24 ( @xmath50 ) , and substituting @xmath51 one immediately obtains @xmath52 .",
    "accounting for finite lifetime of the photons and excitons , one obtains  @xcite :    @xmath53    varying the number of the excitations , which can be done by increasing of the pump power , one can thus change the rabi splitting in the system .",
    "note that coupling constant g scales with the quantization area as @xmath54 , so @xmath55 depends on the concentration of the photons @xmath56 only .",
    "to investigate the dynamics of the system under coherent pump with account for finite lifetimes of the photons and dark excitons in the cavity , the approach should be modified .",
    "we will use a system of coupled nonlinear equations for the dynamics of the macroscopic wavefunctions describing cavity photons and dark excitons .",
    "the latter can be obtained in the following way .",
    "first , let us write the heisenberg equations of motion for the operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 :    @xmath59=\\hbar\\omega_p\\hat p+g\\hat a^2,\\\\   i\\hbar\\frac{d\\hat a}{dt}&=&\\left[\\hat a,\\hat { \\cal{h}}\\right]=\\hbar\\omega_a\\hat a+2g\\hat p\\hat a^\\dagger .",
    "\\label{motion2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then , one should take averages of the above equations thus passing from the operators to the mean values as @xmath60 .",
    "we present a mean product of several operators by products of the mean values of the operators ( e.g. @xmath61 ) .",
    "this approximation is relevant for coherent statistics .",
    "finally , we phenomenologically introduce the lifetimes of the modes and external coherent pumping of cavity photons ( by a coherent laser beam ) with frequency @xmath13 . as a result , eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) transform into the following system of nonlinear differential equations :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 with @xmath64 being lifetimes of the modes , @xmath65 is the amplitude of the coherent pump and @xmath66 . making a substitution @xmath67 , in the stationary regime",
    "the equations read : @xmath68 where @xmath69 , which can be reduced to : @xmath70 this result can also be written in terms of the real functions describing the number of the photons , @xmath71 and excitons , @xmath72 : @xmath73=i_a,\\\\ & & n_p=\\frac{g^2n_a^2}{\\gamma_p^2+\\hbar^2\\delta_p^2 } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74    equation  ( 15 ) is a cubic equation for @xmath75 .",
    "the results are represented in fig .",
    "3(a ) for the following parameters corresponding to the system : @xmath76 @xmath77 , @xmath78 @xmath77 , and three different values of detunings @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "these curves reveal an s - shaped dependence of the mode populations on the intensity of the pump , which characterizes the phenomenon of bistability , which is well - known in semiconductor microcavities  @xcite .",
    "if the value of the pumping intensity lies in the bistable zone , the system can , in principle , occupy more than one possible state , and the particular choice of this state depends on the history of the evolution .",
    "bistability is a fundamental ingredient of several devices based on semiconductor microcavities , such as memory elements  @xcite , spin switches  @xcite , spin patterns  @xcite , and optical circuit designs  @xcite .    ;",
    "( green dot line ) @xmath81 ; ( blue bold line ) @xmath82 .",
    "the influence of the exciton - exciton interaction on the hysteresis curve is illustrated in figure ( b ) , where the cases of @xmath83=0 ( red dashed curve ) and @xmath84 ( red solid curve ) are presented .",
    "the detuning parameters are @xmath85 . ]",
    "however , there is substantial difference between the previous works and the paradigm developed in our paper .",
    "indeed , in most of the previous approaches bistability resulted from the exciton - exciton ( coulomb and exchange ) interaction , even in thz emitting systems  @xcite . here , the bistability arises due to the nonlinearity of the two - photon absorption process .",
    "it should be noted that , still , excitons are present in the system and their interaction can , in principle , change the physical behavior .",
    "the exciton - exciton interaction can be accounted for by means of the term : @xmath86 which should be added to hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) . then",
    ", the equations of motion change to : @xmath87 and in the stationary regime we obtain the following solution : @xmath88 to define the constant @xmath83 , we use the formula @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the exciton binding energy , @xmath91 is the exciton bohr radius and @xmath7 is the laser spot area  @xcite . in qws based on gaas - based alloys , we can use the parameters : @xmath92 @xmath77 and @xmath93 @xmath94 .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "3(b ) .    as one can see the exciton - exciton interaction term changes the shape of the bistable behavior of the system .",
    "it becomes more extended on intensity of the coherent pump .",
    "the density of the excitons compared with the non - interacting case decreases as well .",
    "we therefore conclude that the influence of the nonlinearity of the two - photon absorption on the bistability of the system is comparable with the contribution of exciton - exciton interactions . for simplicity , here",
    "we have considered a single spin degree of freedom , which corresponds to the case in which a circularly polarized optical pump excites 2p excitons with a single spin polarization .",
    "indeed , we do expect a variety of spin sensitive phenomena to take place in the system with different polarizations of pumping .",
    "note that the polarization of 2p excitons can still be controlled via the polarization of the optical pumping , allowing analogous effects to those in conventional microcavities  @xcite .",
    "we developed a theoretical approach for the description of strong light - matter interaction in a system with two - photon absorption processes .",
    "we calculated the photoluminescence spectrum , where a splitting occurs due to the coupling between photons and 2p dark - excitons in the two photon absorption process .",
    "we developed the mean - field equations , valid under coherent excitation of the system , and demonstrated that the nonlinearity of the two - photon absorption process gives rise to the phenomenon of bistability .",
    "the two - photon to 2p exciton matrix element was accurately calculated .",
    "this formalism is not only directly applicable for device construction , but also highlights the nonlinear nature of the system , which may be useful for the realization of quantum optical devices under coherent pumping  @xcite .",
    "in the present appendix we calculate the matrix element of two - photon absorption using second order perturbation theory .",
    "the excitation of the 2p exciton state can occur , mediated by a virtual state representing the state of the system after the absorption of a photon .",
    "the virtual states of s - type are the only ones allowed by selection rules and the transition from an s - type state to the 2p exciton state occurs with the absorption of the second photon .",
    "the total two - photon absorption matrix element is given by summing over all virtual s - type states .",
    "the hamiltonian in the case of exciton - photon interaction can be written in the form : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the elementary charges of an electron and hole , respectively ; @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the electron and hole effective masses , respectively ; @xmath100 is the electron - hole interaction potential ; @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the quasi - momenta ; @xmath18 is the vector potential of the electromagnetic field . in the dipole approximation ,",
    "the vector potential does not depend on coordinate and reads : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a unit vector describing the light polarization . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the vacuum and the relative permittivity , respectively ; @xmath13 is the frequency of exciting light ; @xmath105 is the cavity volume , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the wavelength of the fundamental cavity mode ; @xmath108 is the refractive index of the material and @xmath7 is the area of the laser spot which roughly defines the area in which excitons exist . keeping the terms linear in @xmath109 and introducing the center of mass coordinates",
    ", we obtain the equation for the perturbation operator : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the quasi - momentum of the relative electron - hole motion , @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the reduced mass .",
    "the intrinsic motion of the exciton can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath114 we will not consider the motion of the center of mass , as in dipole approximation it does not feel any influence of light at normal incidence . the eigenfunctions and eigenstates will be similar in form to eigenfunctions and eigenstates for the 2d hydrogen atom with the difference that the reduced mass @xmath10 replaces the free electron mass , the material permitivity replaces the vacuum permitivity and energies are taken with respect to the band - gap  @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates for a 2d systen are described by the schrdinger equation , which in polar coordinates reads : @xmath115-\\frac{q^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\epsilon r } \\right)\\psi(r,\\phi)=(e - e_g)\\psi(r,\\phi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the semiconductor band - gap .",
    "using separation of variables @xmath116 we obtain the normalized angular and radial eigenfunctions : @xmath117^{1/2}(\\beta_n r)^{|l|}e^{-\\beta_n r/2 } { _ 1f_1}(-n+|l|+1,2|l|+1,\\beta_n r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 and @xmath118 are principle and angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively ;    @xmath119    and @xmath120 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",
