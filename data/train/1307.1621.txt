    "the recent detection of ultra - high energies ( uhe ) neutrinos by the icecube neutrino observatory @xcite starts a new era in the neutrino physics . these and forthcoming data may shed light on the observation of air showers events with energies in excess of @xmath0 gev , reveal aspects of new physics as well as of the qcd dynamics at high energies ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the main ingredients for estimating event rates at icecube is the neutrino - hadron cross section ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath1 at high energies , which provides a probe of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the kinematic region of very small values of bjorken-@xmath2 , not explored by the hera measurements @xcite , has been discussed by several authors considering different approaches @xcite .",
    "currently there is a large uncertainty in the predictions , directly associated with the uncertainty present in the treatment of the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "theoretically , at high energies ( small bjorken-@xmath2 ) one expects the transition of the regime described by the dglap dynamics @xcite , where only the parton emissions are considered , to a new regime where the physical process of recombination of partons becomes important in the parton cascade and the evolution is given by a non - linear evolution equation @xcite .",
    "this regime is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction ( parton saturation ) , with the transition being specified by a typical scale , which is energy and atomic number dependent and is called saturation scale @xmath3 . moreover",
    ", the growth of the parton distribution is expected to saturate , forming a color glass condensate ( cgc ) ( for recent reviews see ref .",
    "although a large amount of data at hera , rhic and lhc data can be described by the cgc formalism , the determination of the magnitude and kinematical region where the saturation effects can not be disregarded still is an open question .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we examined to what extent the cross section is sensitive to the presence of new dynamical effects in the qcd evolution . we have compared the more recent predictions based on the nlo dglap evolution equation with those from the color glass condensate physics .",
    "our results demonstrated that the current theoretical uncertainty for the neutrino - nucleon cross section reaches a factor three for neutrino energies around @xmath0 gev and increases to 5.5 for @xmath4 gev . in this paper",
    "we complement the study performed in ref .",
    "@xcite in two points .",
    "the first one , is the study of the average inelasticity at high energies considering different approaches for the neutrino - nucleon cross section .",
    "this analysis is motivated by the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors demonstrated that the inelasticity , which is the fraction of the neutrino energy which flows to the hadronic part of the interaction in the laboratory frame , is strongly dependent on the high energy behaviour of the cross section .",
    "the second point is the study of neutrino - nucleus interactions at high energies . in this case",
    "the high parton density present in the nucleus is expected to modify the parton distributions and amplify the saturation effects .",
    "we update previous dglap studies @xcite considering here the eps09 parametrization @xcite for the nuclear parton distributions and estimate the neutrino - nucleus cross section considering the saturation effects and different models to describe the dipole - nucleus interaction . as in @xcite ,",
    "our goal in this study is to estimate the theoretical uncertainty in the neutrino - nucleus cross section at ultra high energies by considering very distinct models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the formalism for the treatment of neutrino deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) in terms of the qcd improved parton model and using the color dipole formalism , which is useful to include the non - linear effects . in section [ ymed ]",
    "we present the different models used to calculate the neutrino - nucleon cross section and present our predictions for the average inelasticity .",
    "the neutrino - nucleus cross section is discussed in section [ sec_nuclear ] considering the linear dglap formalism and the eps09 parametrization as well as different models for the dipole - nucleus cross section .",
    "moreover , we present our predictions for the nuclear effects in the total cross section .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we present a summary of our main conclusions .",
    "deep inelastic neutrino scattering is described in terms of charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions , which proceed through @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchanges , respectively .",
    "as the neutral current ( nc ) interactions are subdominant , we will consider in what follows , for simplicity , only charged current ( cc ) interactions .",
    "the total neutrino - hadron cross section is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the neutrino energy , @xmath9 with @xmath10 the hadron mass , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the minimum value of @xmath13 which is introduced in order to stay in the deep inelastic region . in what follows",
    "we assume @xmath14 gev@xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the differential cross section is given by @xcite    @xmath16\\,\\ , , \\label{difcross}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 or @xmath18 , with @xmath18 the atomic number , @xmath19 is the fermi constant and @xmath20 denotes the mass of the charged gauge boson .",
    "the calculation of @xmath1 involves integrations over @xmath2 and @xmath13 , with the integral being dominated by the interaction with partons of lower @xmath2 and @xmath13 values of the order of the electroweak boson mass squared .    in",
    "the qcd improved parton model the structure functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are calculated in terms of quark and gluon distribution functions . in this case the neutrino - hadron cross section for charged current interactions on an isoscalar target is given by ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath23 \\label{difcross_partonic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the quark and antiquark densities given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in what follows ,",
    "we consider that the evolution of the parton distributions is given by the dglap equations and use the ct10 parametrization @xcite in our calculations of the neutrino - nucleon cross section . in the nuclear case",
    ", we also consider that the parton distributions are modified by nuclear effects as described by the eps09 parametrization @xcite .",
    "the resulting predictions for the neutrino - hadron cross section characterize the linear qcd dynamics .    in order to introduce non - linear ( saturation ) effects in the qcd dynamics",
    ", we will describe the structure functions considering the color dipole approach in which the dis to low @xmath2 can be viewed as a result of the interaction of a color @xmath26 dipole which the gauge boson fluctuates @xcite . in this approach the @xmath27 structure function is expressed in terms of the transverse and longitudinal structure functions , @xmath28 which are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the transverse size of the dipole , @xmath31 is the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by a quark and @xmath32 are proportional to the wave functions of the virtual charged gauge boson corresponding to their transverse or longitudinal polarizations .",
    "furthermore , @xmath33 describes the interaction of the color dipole with the target . in the color glass condensate formalism",
    "the dipole - target cross section @xmath33 can be computed in the eikonal approximation , resulting @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the forward dipole - target scattering amplitude for a given impact parameter @xmath36 which encodes all the information about the hadronic scattering , and thus about the non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function .",
    "it is useful to assume that the impact parameter dependence of @xmath37 can be factorized as @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being a free parameter related to the non - perturbative qcd physics .",
    "the balitsky - jimwlk hierarchy @xcite describes the energy evolution of the dipole - target scattering amplitude @xmath41 . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the first equation of this hierarchy decouples and boils down to the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite .    in the last years the next - to - leading order corrections to the bk equation",
    "were calculated @xcite through the ressumation of @xmath42 contributions to all orders , where @xmath43 is the number of flavors .",
    "such calculation allows one to estimate the soft gluon emission and running coupling corrections to the evolution kernel .",
    "the authors have verified that the dominant contributions come from the running coupling corrections , which allow us to determine the scale of the running coupling in the kernel .",
    "the solution of the improved bk equation was studied in detail in refs .",
    "basically , one has that the running of the coupling reduces the speed of the evolution to values compatible with experimental data , with the geometric scaling regime being reached only at ultra - high energies . in @xcite a global analysis of the small @xmath2 data for the proton structure function using the improved bk equation was performed ( see also ref .",
    "in contrast to the bk equation at leading logarithmic @xmath44 approximation , which fails to describe the hera data , the inclusion of running coupling effects in the evolution renders the bk equation compatible with them ( see also @xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered different models for the forward dipole - proton scattering amplitude . in particular , the solution of the running coupling balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite , which is currently the state - of - art for the description of saturation effects , was used as input in our calculations .",
    "this solution will also be used in our calculations of the average inelasticity in the next section .",
    "on the other hand , in the calculations of the neutrino - nucleus cross section it is necessary to specify the forward dipole - nucleus scattering amplitude , @xmath45 , which still is an open question and is usually described by phenomenological models . in section [ sec_nuclear ]",
    "we will present some possible models for this quantity and analyse its implications in @xmath46 .",
    "the inelasticity @xmath47 is the fraction of the neutrino energy transferred to the hadronic target in the laboratory frame .",
    "it is responsible for the relative sizes of the electromagnetic and hadronic showers induced in a charged current neutrino interaction .",
    "its precise determination is fundamental in order to extract the neutrino energy in high energy neutrino telescopes from the detected muon or hadronic showers . in what follows",
    "we estimate the average value of the inelasticity , @xmath48 , which is given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 obtained by the integration of the eq .",
    "( [ difcross ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors demonstrated that the behaviour of @xmath48 at large energies is directly related to the @xmath2 slope of the parton distributions at small-@xmath2 and @xmath51 .",
    "in other words , that the average rapidity is sensitive to the qcd dynamics at high energies , which determines the high energy behaviour of the cross section .",
    "our goal is to update this analysis considering the more recent approaches for the qcd dynamics .",

    "[ 0123 ] ( a ) we present our predictions for the neutrino - proton cross - section considering different models for dynamics , which will be used in the calculations of the average inelasticity .",
    "in particular , we present the linear prediction obtained using the ct10 parametrization @xcite and for comparison the gqrs one @xcite , which have been used in several analysis since its proposition .",
    "the ct10 prediction has a smother growth with energy in comparison with the gqrs one , which is directly associated to the distinct behaviours at small-@xmath2 of the gluon distributions present in these calculations .",
    "a more detailed comparison with other linear models is presented in ref .",
    "we also present the predictions obtained using the solution of the rcbk equation and the phenomenological saturation model proposed by golec - biernat and wusthoff in ref .",
    "@xcite ( denoted gbw hereafter ) , in which the dipole - proton cross section is given by : @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the saturation scale is given by @xmath53 , with @xmath54 gev@xmath15 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "our motivation to use this model , which have been updated in several aspects in the last years , is that it allow us easily to obtain its linear limit , given by @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , it allows to quantify the contribution of the saturation effects in the observable under analysis .",
    "in particular , the difference between the linear and full gbw predictions for the neutrino - proton cross section at large energies is a factor @xmath58 .",
    "it is important to emphasize the similarity between the ct10 and gbw linear predictions at high energies . as already demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite the rcbk model predicts a different normalization and a steeper energy dependence in comparison to the gbw one .    in fig .",
    "[ 0123 ] ( b ) we show our results for the energy dependence of the average inelasticity considering the models discussed above .",
    "all models agree in the predictions for @xmath48 in the kinematical region of low values of the neutrino energy .",
    "however , for energies above @xmath59 gev , the distribution is shifted to lower values of @xmath47 due to the @xmath60 propagator which acts as a cut - off in the integration restricting the values of @xmath13 to around @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the predictions differ by @xmath62 at ultra - high energies , with the gqrs prediction ( @xmath63 ) being the upper bound and the gbw one ( @xmath64 ) the lower bound .",
    "this result confirms that the average inelasticity is sensitive to the qcd dynamics at high energies @xcite .",
    "the distinct gluon distributions present in the grqs and ct10 calculations , with the latter being flatter , implies a reduction of @xmath48 at ultra - high energies . considering the non - linear approaches",
    ", the difference between the rcbk and gbw predictions is directly associated to the transition between the linear and saturation regimes , which is delayed in the rcbk approach , which implies the distinct behaviours in the @xmath65 range . at ultra - high energies ,",
    "both approaches predict the saturation of the dipole - nucleon cross section , which implies similar predictions at @xmath66 gev . comparing the linear and full gbw predictions",
    ", we obtain that the contribution of saturation effects is important for @xmath67 gev , reducing @xmath48 in approximately 10@xmath68 .",
    "finally , the ct10 prediction seems to agree with the gbw - linear one at @xmath69 .",
    "in order to calculate the neutrino - nucleus cross section we need to take into account the nuclear effects in the structure functions ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , after more than 30 years of experimental and theoretical studies , a standard picture of nuclear modifications of structure functions and parton densities has not yet emerged @xcite . fixed target dis measurement on nuclei revealed that the ratio of nuclear to nucleon structure functions ( normalized by the atomic mass number ) is significantly differently than unity . in particular , these data demonstrate an intricate behaviour , with the ratio being less than one at large @xmath2 ( the emc effect ) and at small @xmath2 ( shadowing ) and larger than one for @xmath70 ( antishadowing ) .",
    "the existing data were taken at lower energies and therefore the perturbative qcd regime ( @xmath71 gev@xmath15 ) was explored only for relatively large values of the ( bjorken ) @xmath2 variable ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "experimentally , this situation will hopefully change with a future high energy electron - ion collider ( eic ) ( for recent reviews see , e.g. @xcite ) , which is supposed to take data at higher energies and explore the region of small @xmath2 ( @xmath73 ) in the perturbative qcd regime . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the theory of nuclear effects in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is still far from being concluded .",
    "the straightforward use of nucleon parton distributions evolved with dglap equations and corrected with a nuclear modification factor determined by fitting the existing data as in refs .",
    "@xcite is only well justified in the large @xmath13 region and not too small @xmath2 .",
    "however , these approaches do not address the fundamental problem of the origin of the nuclear shadowing and can not be extended at small @xmath2 where we expect to see new interesting physics related to the non - linear aspects of qcd dynamics @xcite . in order to obtain an uncertainty band for the neutrino - nucleus cross section we consider two extreme scenarios : ( a ) the linear one , with the nuclear structure functions described in terms of parton distributions which evolve according the dglap equations , and ( b ) the non - linear one , with the nuclear structure functions described in terms of the dipole - nucleus scattering amplitude , which takes into account the saturation effects . in this case",
    "we consider some possible models for @xmath45 which are found in the literature .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    lets start our analysis considering the linear scenario for the treatment of nuclear effects in the neutrino - nucleus cross section at high energies .",
    "we will make use of the eps09 parametrization @xcite of the nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) , which is based on a global fit of the nuclear data using the dglap evolution equations .",
    "it is important to emphasize that there are other groups which also propose parametrizations for the nuclear effects in the parton distributions @xcite .",
    "basically , these groups differ in the form of the parametrizations at the initial scale , in the use of different sets of experimental data , in the different nucleon parton densities used in the analysis , in the treatment of isospin effects and in the use of sum rules as additional constraints for the evolution . by construction , these parametrizations describe the current nuclear dis data .",
    "however , the resulting parton distribution sets are very distinct . in particular ,",
    "the predictions of the different groups for @xmath74 differ largely about the magnitude of the shadowing and the presence or not of the antishadowing ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another aspect which is important to emphasize is that the simultaneous description of the neutrino - nucleus and other nuclear data in terms of a single set of nuclear parton distribution functions have being largely discussed in the last years @xcite . while in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors have pointed out that the simultaneous description is not feasible , which could be interpreted as a violation of the universality of the parton distributions , in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors demonstrated that if the overall normalization of the experimental data in neutrino dis is taken into account the current neutrino - nucleus data can also be described in terms of the existing npdfs .",
    "the latter conclusion have been reinforced recently in the studies presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our study",
    "we assume that the npdfs are process independent and consider the eps09 parametrization as a representative model of the nuclear effects .    in fig .",
    "[ ratio - nucle ] ( a ) we present our predictions for the energy dependence of the neutrino - nucleus cross section considering different nuclei .",
    "in order to quantify the nuclear effects , in fig .",
    "[ ratio - nucle ] ( b ) we present the nuclear ratio @xmath75 defined by @xmath76 which is equal to one in the absence of effects .",
    "as expected , the magnitude of the nuclear effects increases with @xmath18 and @xmath8 , which is directly associated to the shadowing effect .",
    "in particular , we predict a reduction of @xmath77 for large energies and @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , which is typical in the cherenkov neutrino detectors such as icecube , we predict that the nuclear cross section will be reduced by @xmath80 for @xmath81gev . in contrast , in the kinematical range of low energies ( @xmath82gev ) and for light nuclei",
    "we predict an enhancement of the nuclear cross section due to the antishadowing effect .",

    "the cross section comes from the region of small values of @xmath2 and the choice of @xmath102 is not important . on the other hand , at lower energies , the dipole predictions becomes strongly dependent on the choice of @xmath102 .",
