    "among the microscopic approaches to the nuclear many - body problem , the framework of nuclear energy density functionals ( nedf ) provides the most complete and accurate description of ground - state properties and collective excitations over the whole nuclide chart .",
    "probably no other method achieves comparable accuracy at the same computational cost . at the level of practical applications",
    "the nedf framework is realized in terms of self - consistent mean - field ( scmf ) models based , for instance , on the gogny effective interaction , the skyrme energy functional , and the relativistic meson - exchange effective lagrangian @xcite . in the mean - field approximation",
    "the dynamics of the nuclear many - body system is represented by independent nucleons moving in self - consistent potentials , that correspond to the actual density and current distributions of a given nucleus .",
    "the scmf approach to nuclear structure is analogous to kohn - sham density functional theory @xcite , and nuclear mean - field models approximate the exact energy functional , which includes all higher - order correlations , with powers and gradients of ground - state nucleon densities and currents @xcite .",
    "in particular , a number of very successful relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models have been constructed based on the framework of quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite .",
    "there are important advantages in using functionals with manifest covariance @xcite .",
    "the most obvious is the natural inclusion of the nucleon spin degree of freedom , and the resulting nuclear spin - orbit potential which emerges automatically with the empirical strength in a covariant formulation .",
    "the consistent treatment of large , isoscalar , lorentz scalar and vector self - energies provides a unique parametrization of time - odd components of the nuclear mean - field , i.e. nucleon currents , which is absent in the non - relativistic representation of the energy density functional .",
    "the empirical pseudospin symmetry in nuclear spectroscopy finds a natural explanation in terms of relativistic mean fields @xcite . on a microscopic level ,",
    "it has been argued @xcite that a covariant formulation of nuclear dynamics manifests the true energy scales of qcd in nuclei , and is consistent with the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry through the implicit inclusion of pion - nucleon dynamics in the effective nucleon self - energies .",
    "a covariant treatment of nuclear matter provides a distinction between scalar and four - vector nucleon self energies , leading to a very natural saturation mechanism .    in conventional qhd the nucleus",
    "is described as a system of dirac nucleons coupled to exchange mesons through an effective lagrangian .",
    "the isoscalar scalar @xmath0 meson , the isoscalar vector @xmath1 meson , and the isovector vector @xmath2 meson build the minimal set of meson fields that is necessary for a description of bulk and single - particle nuclear properties .",
    "of course , at the scale of low - energy nuclear structure , heavy - meson exchange is just a convenient representation of the effective nuclear interaction . at the energy and momentum scales characteristic of nuclei , the only degrees of freedom that have to be taken into account explicitly in the description of many - body dynamics are pions and nucleons .",
    "the behavior of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction at long and intermediate distances is determined by one- and two - pion exchange processes .",
    "the exchange of heavy mesons is associated with short - distance dynamics that can not be resolved at low energies that characterize nuclear binding and , therefore , can be represented by local four - point ( contact ) nn interactions , with low - energy ( medium - dependent ) parameters adjusted to nuclear data .",
    "these concepts of effective field theory and density functional theory methods have recently been used to derive a microscopic relativistic energy density functional framework constrained by in - medium qcd sum rules and chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the density dependence of the effective nucleon - nucleon couplings is determined from the long- and intermediate - range interactions generated by one- and two - pion exchange processes .",
    "they are computed using in - medium chiral perturbation theory , explicitly including @xmath3 degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "regularization dependent contributions to the energy density of nuclear matter , calculated at three - loop level , are absorbed in contact interactions with parameters representing unresolved short - distance dynamics .",
    "however , even in a fully microscopic approach that starts from a description of symmetric and asymmetric , homogeneous and inhomogeneous nuclear matter , the parameters of a nuclear energy density functional have still to be fine tuned to structure data of finite nuclei .",
    "this is simply because gross properties of infinite nuclear matter can not determine the density functional on the level of accuracy that is needed for a quantitative description of structure phenomena in finite nuclei . for most functionals this tuning",
    "is performed on a relatively small set of spherical closed - shell nuclei , mainly because they are simple to calculate and can therefore be easily included in multiparameter _ least - squares _ fits .",
    "a problem arises , however , because ground - state data of closed - shell nuclei include long - range correlations that can not really be absorbed into mean - field functionals .",
    "generally this will affect the predictive power of energy density functionals when they are used in the description of phenomena related to the evolution of shell structure .",
    "for instance , soft potential energy surfaces and/or small energy differences between coexisting minima in deformed nuclei , are often difficult to describe using functionals adjusted solely to data of spherical nuclei , even when sophisticated models are employed that include angular momentum and particle number projection , as well as intrinsic configuration mixing .    in this work",
    "we explore a class of relativistic energy density functionals originally introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite but , instead of using low - energy qcd constraints for the medium dependence of the parameters , a phenomenological ansatz is adjusted exclusively to masses of a relatively large set of axially deformed nuclei . the phenomenological approach , although guided by microscopic nucleon self - energies in nuclear matter , gives us more freedom to investigate in detail the relationship between global properties of a nuclear matter equation of state ( volume , surface , and asymmetry energies ) and the corresponding predictions for nuclear binding energies .",
    "eventually the goal will be to develop an energy density functional that does not implicitly contain symmetry breaking corrections and quadrupole fluctuation correlations , and is therefore better suited for the new relativistic model that uses the generator coordinate method to perform configuration mixing of angular - momentum and particle - number projected relativistic wave functions @xcite .",
    "the idea is that those correlations that we wish to treat explicitly , should not be included in the density functional in an implicit way , i.e. by adjusting parameters to data which already include correlations .",
    "the solution could be to adjust the functional to pseudodata , obtained by subtracting correlation effects from experimental masses and , eventually , radii .",
    "this is most easily done using masses of axially deformed nuclei with large deformation parameters , because the dominant contribution to their ground - state correlation energies is the rotational energy correction @xcite , which is relatively simple to calculate .",
    "approximate methods for the calculation of correlations have been developed @xcite , that enable a systematic evaluation of correlation energies for the nuclear mass table .",
    "of course one expects that the corresponding modifications of the parameters of the energy density functional will be relatively small , but even a small change in the relative contribution of various interaction terms could be the decisive factor in the description of soft potential energy surfaces , coexistence of prolate and oblate shapes , level ordering , etc .",
    "very recent examples include the phenomenon of shape coexistence in neutron - deficient kr isotopes @xcite , and the description of singular properties of excitation spectra and transition rates at critical points of quantum shape phase transitions @xcite . as a first step toward the construction of a relativistic density functional that could provide a more accurate description of phenomena related to the evolution of shell structure , in this work we explore the possibility to determine the parameters of a given functional using only binding energies of axially deformed nuclei .    in section [ secii ]",
    "we construct the relativistic nuclear energy density functional based on the above conjectures , and discuss the necessary approximations and fitting strategies . in section [ seciii ] , starting from microscopic nucleon self - energies in nuclear matter , and empirical global properties of the nuclear matter equation of state , the functional is accurately determined in a careful comparison of the predicted binding energies with data , for a set of 64 axially deformed nuclei in the mass regions @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in section [ seciv ] the new energy density functional",
    "is thoroughly tested in a series of illustrative calculations of properties of spherical and deformed medium - heavy and heavy nuclei , including binding energies , charge radii , deformation parameters , neutron skin thickness , and excitation energies of giant multipole resonances .",
    "section [ secv ] summarizes the results of the present investigations and ends with an outlook for future studies .",
    "the basic building blocks of a relativistic nuclear energy density functional are the densities and currents bilinear in the dirac spinor field @xmath6 of the nucleon : @xmath7 here @xmath8 are the isospin pauli matrices and @xmath9 generically denotes the dirac matrices .",
    "the nuclear ground - state density and energy are determined by the self - consistent solution of relativistic linear single - nucleon kohn - sham equations . to derive those equations it is useful to construct an interaction lagrangian with four - fermion ( contact ) interaction terms in the various isospace - space channels :"
