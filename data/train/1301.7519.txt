    "the paper by dorfman @xcite introduced the idea of _ group testing _ and also presented a simple analysis , which indicates advantages of the idea .",
    "his main motivation was to devise an _ economical way _ to detect infected persons within a population by using blood tests .",
    "it is assumed that the outcome of a blood test determines if the blood used in the test contains certain target viruses ( or bacteria ) .    of course",
    ", blood tests for every person in the population would clearly distinguish the infected individuals from those who are not infected .",
    "dorfman s idea for reducing the number of tests is the following .",
    "we first divide the population into several disjoint groups and then mix the blood of individuals in each group to form _",
    "pools_. the test process then consists of two - stages . in the first stage ,",
    "the pools containing infected blood are determined by blood test of each pool . in the second stage ,",
    "all the individuals in those groups with positive results are tested .",
    "numerical examples show that the number of tests can be reduced without loss of detection capability @xcite .",
    "dorfman s idea triggered the emergence of subsequent theoretical works on group testing and a variety of practical applications , such as the screening of dna clone libraries and the detection of faulty machines parts @xcite @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent advances in the theory of compressed sensing @xcite @xcite have stimulated research into the theoretical aspects of group testing .",
    "the group testing scheme due to dorfman can be classified as _ adaptive group testing _ , in which the latter part of test design depends on the results of earlier tests .",
    "there is also _ non - adaptive group testing _ , in which the test design is completely determined before conducting any tests .",
    "intuitively , adaptive group testing seems advantageous over non - adaptive group testing because it requires fewer tests .",
    "however , there are also advantages to the non - adaptive group testing , since in this design , all the tests can be executed in parallel .",
    "note that adaptive group testing requires sequential tests and thus prevents parallel testing .    in order to develop a non - adaptive group testing scheme with good detection performance ,",
    "pool design is crucial . in the field of combinatorial group testing , a pooling matrix that defines the set of pools to be tested",
    "is constructed by using combinatorial design and combinatorics .",
    "the _ deterministic construction _ of a @xmath6-disjunct matrix is one of the central themes of combinatorial group testing @xcite @xcite .    pooling matrices",
    "can also be obtained by _ random construction _ ; that is , the @xmath7-elements of a pooling matrix are determined probabilistically .",
    "several reconstruction algorithms have been proposed for such probabilistically constructed pooling matrices .",
    "for example , sejdinovic and johnson @xcite , kanamori et al .",
    "@xcite recently proposed reconstruction algorithms based on belief propagation .",
    "malioutov and malyutov @xcite , chan et al .",
    "@xcite studied reconstruction algorithms based on linear programming ( lp ) .    clarifying the scaling behavior of",
    "the number of required tests for correct reconstruction has become one of the most important topics in this field .",
    "berger and levenshtein @xcite studied a two - stage group testing scheme and unveiled the scaling law for the number of required tests based on information theoretic arguments .",
    "mzard and toninelli @xcite provided a novel analysis of two - stage schemes based on theoretical techniques from statistical mechanics .",
    "recently , atia and saligrama @xcite presented an information theoretic analysis of non - adaptive group testing with and without noise .",
    "they presented a direct part theorem that gives a condition for the existence of an estimator achieving arbitrary small estimation error probability and a converse part theorem that gives a condition for the non - existence of good estimators .",
    "the arguments in their proof of these theorems are based on the proof of the channel coding theorems for multiple access channels , and they can be applied to both noiseless and noisy observations .",
    "for example , in the noiseless case , it was shown that a @xmath6-sparse instance of @xmath4-objects can be perfectly recovered from the test results if the number of tests is asymptotically @xmath8 .",
    "the main motivation of this work is to provide an information - theoretic analysis of non - adaptive group testing based on sparse pooling graphs . in this paper , we assume that the status ( 0 or 1 ) of an object is modeled by a bernoulli random variable with probability @xmath0 . in other words , we consider the scenario in which the sparsity parameter @xmath6 scales as @xmath9 asymptotically . in most conventional information theoretic analyses , such as @xcite , @xmath6 is assumed to be independent of @xmath4 .",
    "such an assumption is reasonable in order to clarify the dependency of the required number of tests on the sparsity parameter and the number of objects .",
    "although our assumption is different from the conventional one , it is also natural from an information theoretic point of view and is suitable for observing sharp threshold behaviors in the asymptotic regime .",
    "another new aspect is that the analysis is carried out under the assumption of an @xmath10-regular pooling graph ensemble , which is a bipartite graph ensemble with left node degree @xmath2 and right node degree @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of left nodes .",
    "this model is suitable for handling a very sparse pooling matrix and is amenable to ensemble analysis .",
    "we will present both direct and converse theorems that predict the asymptotic behavior of a group testing scheme with an @xmath10-pooling graph .",
    "these asymptotic conditions are parameterized by @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . therefore , for a given pair @xmath11 , we can determine the region for @xmath0 in which we can achieve arbitrarily accurate estimation .",
    "our analysis was inspired by the analysis of gallager and others @xcite @xcite @xcite of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes .",

    "as stated before , the generator functions for the noiseless system are given by @xmath356 and @xmath357 . from theorem [ gentheorem ] , we thus have the achievability condition @xmath358 \\frac l r   \\log_2((1+z)^r-1 )      - lp \\log_2 z \\right ) + \\gamma < 0.\\ ] ] the condition can be simplified into @xmath359 which is the achievability condition of corollary [ coro ] .",

    "there are strong similarities between group testing schemes and linear error correction schemes for binary symmetric channels .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper was inspired by the theoretical works on ldpc codes @xcite @xcite . from numerical evaluation , it was shown that the gap between the upper bound @xmath246 and the lower bound @xmath251 is usually quite small .",
    "this suggests the existence of a sharp threshold , which is similar to the shannon limit for a channel coding problem .",
    "on the other hand , from the analysis presented here , we note a fundamental difference between a group testing scheme and a binary linear error correction scheme .",
    "the lower bounds on the estimation error probability , which we proved in this paper , imply that a group testing scheme requires a sparse pooling graph or pooling matrix for asymptotically optimal reconstruction .",
    "note from an information - theoretic point of view , a dense parity check matrix is desirable for realizing a good linear error correction scheme .",
    "the main contribution of this work is the direct theorems , which give the conditions for achieving arbitrarily small estimation error probabilities . in the same way that the shannon limit has been used as a benchmark for the combination of a code and a decoding algorithm",
    ", these results can provide a concrete benchmark for existing and emerging reconstruction algorithms , such as belief propagation @xcite @xcite , and can stimulate the development of novel reconstruction algorithms . in this paper",
    ", we assumed a bernoulli source and noise , but , since the aep holds for them , the arguments presented here may be applicable to stationary ergodic sources and noises .",
