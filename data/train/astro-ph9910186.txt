    "the discovery and the subsequent mapping of  in the interstellar medium through the detection of its 1809 kev @xmath2-ray line by satellites ( heao-3 , comptel - cgro , and for the future : integral ) has increased the interest in  nucleosynthesis .",
    "the potential sites for  production include supernovae , wolf - rayet stars , agb ( asymptotic giant branch ) stars and novae ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "consequently , the nuclear physics involved in  nucleosynthesis is of renewed importance .",

    "this temperature is uncomfortably close to the peak temperature attained in nova outbursts ( @xmath40.35  gk ) or in agb thermal pulses ( @xmath40.3  gk ) .",

    "the most favored configurations are when they couple to @xmath8 = @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( 5@xmath11 ) making the ground state ( 5@xmath11 ) and isomer ( 0@xmath11 ) .",
    "internal ( gamma ) transitions from the isomer to the ground state are inhibited by the large spin difference .",
    "beta decay of the isomer ( @xmath9 ) to the ground state of the even - even nucleus @xmath12 mg ( @xmath9 ) is not hampered by spin difference and hence constitutes the sole decay mode of   ( @xmath0=6.34  s ) .",
    "on the contrary the ground state  with @xmath13 has its beta decay to the @xmath12 mg ground state forbidden .",
    "hence it decays slowly ( @xmath0=0.74  my ) towards excited sates of @xmath12 mg which subsequently de  excite through internal transitions leading to the observed gammas .",

    "it has also @xmath15 ( = 17 ) , odd  odd , and a relatively long lived isomer .",
    "however , contrary to the  case , the ground state has the lowest spin and hence a shorter half - life ( @xmath9 , 1.53  s ) than the isomer ( @xmath16 , 32  m ) , located 146  kev above .",

    "are introduced as separate `` isotopes '' connected via `` nuclear reactions '' ( i.e. gamma transitions ) whose rates are given by the @xmath24 matrix elements .",
