    "intersections between the displaced down - converted photon dispersion surfaces represent bloch vectors that phase - match according to equation  [ eq : phase - matching ] .",
    "the full set of solutions corresponds to the intersection of the full two - dimensional dispersion surfaces .",
    "however the existence of an intersection in the diagrams discussed above is a necessary and sufficient condition for the two surfaces to have an intersection .",
    "\\(iv ) * plotting the emission * : having determined that the intersections exist , we look at the detailed direction of the emission . to do this analytically we make the simplifying assumption that the crystal transverse dimensions are infinite ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "this is both justified in most experimental situations and makes it possible to produce a manageable analytical prediction of the emission .",
    "the transverse part of the phase - matching function then becomes a product of two delta functions that ensure : @xmath161 substituting these relations into the longitudinal part of the phase - matching function ( eq .  [ eq : pm ] with the @xmath162-function replaced by the appropriate sinc function ) to eliminate either @xmath163 or @xmath164 , we can then plot the phase - matching function for each emission .",
    "the elimination procedure is equivalent to calculating a partial trace over the emissions of the twin photon .",
    "it should be noted that the partial trace calculation is much simpler than in the case of birefringent non - linear crystals such as bbo since the optic axis is by default aligned with the crystal axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : pmfs ] shows such a plot for three types of processes : type i where a pump photon with tm polarization down - converts to photons 1 and 2 with te polarization : @xmath165 , type ii : @xmath166 and type iii : @xmath167 .",
    "the width of the emission rings corresponds to the allowed longitudinal momentum mismatch and is inversely proportional to the crystal length .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : pmfs ] , it is an important parameter for the crystal size being considered here . for a discussion of the relation between the crystal thickness and the yield of entangled photon pairs in bbo ,",

    "the values of @xmath122 for photons 1 and 2 are read off the plot . the amplitude for the phase - matched process",
    "can then be calculated by performing the sum over the fourier coefficients ( eq .  [ eq : pm ] ) , or by numerical integration of the field amplitudes in the non - linear layers ( eq.[eq : pmspatial ] ) . in the case of the fourier amplitude calculation",

    "( middle ) or figure  [ fig : entang ] there is one dominant combination of @xmath9s : @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 . for this combination",
    "the fourier amplitudes are 0.66 , 0.90 , 0.99 and 0.98 respectively .",
    "the combined effect of the fourier amplitudes leads to a factor 0.58 .",
    "in addition , the tensor nature of the @xmath2 interaction needs to be included .",
    "this is done by taking the contraction of the unit polarization vectors of the relevant fourier components of @xmath178 with the @xmath2 tensor : @xmath179 .",
    "the @xmath2 tensor of algaas has @xmath180 point group symmetry and has only three non - zero coefficients all having magnitude @xmath181  @xcite .",
    "for the conventional ( 100 ) surface orientation , the crystalline axis coincides with the direction of normal incidence that we have defined to be the @xmath83 direction . for photons emitted in the directions corresponding to the intersection of the rings in figure  [ fig : pmfs ] ( middle ) or figure  [ fig : entang ] this leads to a value of @xmath182 .",
    "we are thus in a position to compare the efficiency of the process to that in bbo .",
    "the overall down - conversion efficiency for our example structure and choice of pump parameters is @xmath183 times that in a bbo crystal of similar size , where we have assumed that there is no reduction of the @xmath184 value of the bbo @xmath2 coming from the tensor nature of the interaction .",
    "it should be noted that there will also be down - conversion into directions that phase - match but do not involve leading fourier amplitudes .",
    "these can be treated in exactly the same way , but will have much lower amplitude .",
    "\\(vi ) * extraction of polarization - entangled photon pairs * :     +    to extract entangled photon pairs , we proceed as in the scheme for the extraction of entangled photons from non - linear crystals  @xcite , by collecting photon pairs from the intersection between the te emission and the tm emission ( see figure  [ fig : entang ] ) . at each intersection",
    "the photons will be polarized te(h ) or tm(v ) with equal amplitude .",
    "however since the photons are emitted in te / tm pairs , which ever the polarization of a photon at one intersection , we know the twin photon at the other intersection will have opposite polarization . adding the amplitudes we obtain a maximally entangled polarization state : @xmath185 where @xmath186 is a phase that can be easily tuned experimentally , for example by placing a birefringent element in one of the paths .",
    "the existence of a fixed phase relation between the two terms depends on the genuine impossibility of deducing the polarization of a photon collected at one of the intersections from any of its other properties .",
    "such a coupling between degrees of freedom reduces the coherence between the terms .",
    "there are many techniques to recover the coherence , for example the use of compensating crystals  @xcite or of a polarizing beam - splitter  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a fully quantum - mechanical treatment of the down - conversion process in non - linear photonic crystals , showing how to calculate the emission analytically in one dimensional structures .",
    "we have applied the theory to a realistic one - dimensional structure that consists of alternating layers of al@xmath0ga@xmath1as and air and demonstrated that entangled photons with a wavelength of 1500 nm can be extracted from the down - conversion emission that results from the decay of pump photons having a wavelength of 750 nm .",
    "we now suggest some possible extensions of the present work .",
    "the results for the @xmath2 mediated emission of section  [ sec : fff ] are valid for structures of one , two and three dimensions .",
    "an obvious extension is thus the explicit analysis of bloch - wave phase - matching in two and three - dimensional structures .",
    "an advantage of the use of two - dimensional structures is that two - dimensional structures with a large index contrast can be more easily fabricated than one dimensional structures with a large index contrast .",
    "another interesting extension is the analysis of down - conversion in the case where the pump photons arrive in short pulses or wave - packets ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the problem in bbo ) .",
    "this brings up the topic of group velocity dispersion in photonic crystals which can differ significantly from its counterpart in natural crystals .",
    "it seems likely that the possibility of tuning this form of dispersion will provide interesting possibilities .",
    "another interesting avenue of research might be to investigate the potential advantages of down - converting to frequencies near a photonic band edge , where the density of states is considerably larger than that at the centre of a band , thus further improving the efficiency .",
    "finally it might be interesting to consider down - conversion of frequencies close to the non - linear material absorption band - gap , where the non - linearity can be significantly enhanced .    in conclusion .",
    "the high degree of control afforded by the freedom of choosing the crystal geometry combined with the high non - linearity of semiconductor materials for which many advanced fabrication techniques have been developed make non - linear photonic crystals a promising source of entangled photon pairs .",
    "in this appendix we derive an expression for the fourier coefficients of the periodic part of the electric field in one - dimensional bragg structures . throughout",
    "we will drop the te(m ) labels since the derivation is identical for the two cases .",
