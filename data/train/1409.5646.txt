    ", many efforts have been made to characterize those sequences @xmath4 belonging to a wiener chaos of fixed order , which verify a central limit theorem in the sense that @xmath15 converges in distribution , as @xmath16 , to a centered gaussian random variable @xmath17 of unit variance ( compare with the book @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the celebrated fourth moment theorem of nualart and peccati @xcite asserts that if @xmath18 = 1 $ ] for all @xmath19 , then , as @xmath20 , @xmath15 converges in distribution to @xmath17 if and only if @xmath21 $ ] converges to @xmath22 , the fourth moment of the gaussian random variable @xmath17 .",
    "this can be seen as a drastical simplification of the classical method of moments , which ensures convergence in distribution of @xmath15 to @xmath17 , provided that _ all _ moments of @xmath15 converge to that of @xmath17 .",
    "only a few years later , nourdin and peccati @xcite combined stein s method for normal approximation with the malliavin calculus on the wiener space of variations to prove explicit bounds on the total variation distance @xmath23 , where the supremum runs over all bounded borel sets @xmath24 ( in fact , also other notions of distances have been considered in @xcite , but we restrict here to the total variation distance ) .",
    "they showed that for a sequence @xmath4 of random variables of the form @xmath25 with @xmath26 it holds that",

    "namely , if @xmath15 converges in distribution to @xmath17 , as @xmath16 , then there exist two constants @xmath31 ( possibly depending on @xmath5 and on @xmath32 , but not on @xmath33 ) , such that @xmath34 for all @xmath35 , where , recall , @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 - 3(\\ee[f_n^2])^2=\\ee[f_n^4 ] -3 $ ] are the third and the fourth cumulant of @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "in other words this means that the rate provided by is suboptimal by a squareroot factor .",
    "this , however , seems unavoidable using the malliavin - stein technique for normal approximation , which is based on the analysis of fourth moments , while the proof of uses more refined arguments .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study non - central limit theorems ( i.e. , limit theorems with a non - gaussian limiting distribution ) for sequences @xmath4 belonging to a fixed wiener chaos of order @xmath38 , as above .",
    "a first step in this direction is the paper @xcite by nourdin and peccati , in which conditions on the sequence @xmath4 have been derived , under which convergence towards a centred gamma distribution takes place .",
    "moreover , in @xcite rates of convergences for such gamma approximations were considered , again by applying stein s method .",
    "it is an interesting fact that if @xmath5 is an odd integer , there is no sequence of chaotic random variables with bounded variances converging in distribution to a centred gamma distribution .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a random variable @xmath13 with @xmath39 with @xmath5 being odd has third moment equal to zero , while the third moment of a centred gamma distribution is strictly positive . beyond the normal and gamma approximation results in @xcite , up to our best knowledge",
    "there are no other quantitative limit theorems for chaotic sequences so far .",
    "our paper is an attempt to fill this gap in case of the broad class of so - called variance - gamma distributions .",
    "this is a @xmath22-parametric family of continuous probability distributions on the real line defined as variance - mean mixtures of gaussian random variables with a gamma mixing distribution .",
    "we emphasize that variance - gamma distributions are widely used in financal mathematics , for example .",
    "particular examples of variance - gamma distributions are the laplace distribution or more general symmetrized gamma distributions , but also the classical normal or gamma distribution , which show up as limiting cases .",
    "it is interesting to see that in our set - up , no parity condition on @xmath5 is necessary in general .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the recent work @xcite of kusuoka and tudor , where it has been shown that within the so - called pearson - family of probability distributions on the real line , only the normal and the gamma distribution can appear as limit laws for a sequence @xmath4 of chaotic random variables .",
    "the laplace distribution , the symmetrized gamma distribution and , more generally , the variance - gamma distributions , are not members of the pearson - family and this way our study goes beyond the theory developed in @xcite .",
    "besides the goal of identifying new limiting distributions for the sequence @xmath4 as considered above , another source of motivation for our paper comes from the area of free probability . in @xcite , deya and",
    "nourdin studied the convergence of a sequence of multiple stochastic integrals with respect to a free brownian motion to what they call the tetilla law , which can be regarded as the commutator of the well - known marchenko - pastur distribution .",
    "our aim here is to identitfy the non - free analogue of this distribution and to prove a related limit theorem for multiple stochastic integrals with respect to the classical brownian motion .",
    "we will see that the laplace distribution with parameter @xmath40 , which , as already mentioned above , is contained in the class of variance - gamma distributions , can be seen as such an analogue , see remark [ rem : tetilla ] below for a more detailed description .",
    "let us describe our results and the structure of our paper in some more detail .",
    "in section [ sec : malliavin ] we collect some background material related to isonormal gaussian processes and the malliavin calculus of variations on the wiener space .",
    "we will recall in particular the definitions of the so - called @xmath41-operators , which are central for our further investigations .",
    "essential elements of stein s method for variance - gamma distributions are reviewed in section [ subsec : stein ] .",
    "in particular , we state bounds on the solution of the stein equation and introduce some particular subclasses and limiting cases of variance - gamma distributions , which are of special interest .",
    "an abstract bound for the wasserstein distance @xmath42 between a ( suitably regular ) functional @xmath43 of an isonormal gaussian process and a variance - gamma distributed random variable @xmath44 in the spirit of the malliavin - stein method is derived in section [ sec : generalbound ] .",
    "we will see that the bound is expressed in terms of the @xmath41-operators mentioned above .",
    "this general bound is specialized in section [ subsec : generalqgeq2 ] to the case of elements living inside a fixed wiener chaos of order @xmath38 .",
    "we derive a sufficient analytic criterium in terms of contractions for such a sequence to converge in distribution to a variance - gamma distributed random variable . in this context",
    ", we also recover the fourth moment theorem discussed above together with a rate of convergence for the wasserstein distance , which improves , but is still not optimal in view of .",
    "our general bound is specialized in section [ double ] to the case @xmath45 , which is of particular interest in view of the theory of quadratic forms , for example .",
    "we show that in this case the previously derived sufficient criterium for convergence turns out to be necessary and , moreover , equivalent to a simple moment condition involving moments of up to order six only .",
    "for example , we show that a sequence @xmath4 of elements belonging to a second wiener chaos converges in distribution to a random variable @xmath44 having a laplace distribution with parameter @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47\\to 2b^2,\\quad\\ee[f_n^4]\\to 4",

    "this this case , we also have the bound @xmath48 on the wasserstein distance , where , recall , @xmath49 stands for the @xmath30th cumulant of @xmath15 and where @xmath50 are constants only depending on the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "we like to emphasize the following interesting observation .",
    "namely , although the third cumulant @xmath52 shows up in the bound , it automatically vanishes in the limit , as @xmath16 , under the moment condition .",
    "our result can be seen as a six moment theorem for the convergence to a laplace distribution on the second wiener chaos .",
    "an analogue for general variance - gamma distributions is one of the main achievements of this paper .",
    "we mention that this is also closely connected to the work @xcite ( see also the erratum @xcite ) of nourdin and poly , who characterize convergence of a sequences of random elements inside the second wiener chaos associated with the ordinary ( and the free ) brownian motion in terms of conditions on a sequence of consequtive moments .",
    "however , their results do not allow to derive rates of convergence .",
    "in the final section [ dejong ] we deal with a universality question for so - called homogeneous sums with respect to variance - gamma convergence as well as with some multivariate extensions of the previously derived results .",
    "the results of our paper complement those obtained in the recent study of azmoodeh , peccati and poly @xcite , which has independently been conducted in parallel with our paper .",
    "they derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which a sequence @xmath4 as above converges to a limiting random variable , whose distribution is a finite linear combination of centred @xmath53-distributions .",
    "however , these limit theorems are not quantitative in the sense that they just state the convergence in distribution without giving upper bounds on the rate of convergence . on the other hand ,",
