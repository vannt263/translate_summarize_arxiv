    "<S> we evaluate the positive - frequency wightman function , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling for a cylindrical shell in background of ds spacetime . </S>",

    "<S> non - neumann boundary conditions , the bunch - davies vacuum is a physically realizable state for all values of the mass and curvature coupling parameter . for both interior and exterior regions , </S>",
    "<S> the vevs are decomposed into boundary - free ds and shell - induced parts . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the shell - induced part of the vacuum energy - momentum tensor has a nonzero off - diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the radial direction . unlike to the case of a shell in minkowski bulk , for ds background </S>",
    "<S> the axial stresses are not equal to the energy density . in dependence of the mass and of the coefficient in the boundary condition , </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy density and the energy flux can be either positive or negative . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the background gravitational field on the boundary - induced effects is crucial at distances from the shell larger than the ds curvature scale . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the decay of the vevs with the distance is power - law ( monotonic or oscillatory with dependence of the mass ) for both massless and massive fields . </S>",
    "<S> for neumann boundary condition the decay is faster than that for non - neumann conditions .    </S>",
