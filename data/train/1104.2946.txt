    "low - dimensional frustrated spin models have been intensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally@xcite . the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin-1/2 model with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction @xmath1 and next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions",
    "@xmath2 has attracted much attention in recent years@xcite .",
    "the growing interest was triggered by experimental studies of various quasi-1d edge - sharing cuprates@xcite , which can be described by this so - called 1d f - af model .",
    "its hamiltonian has a form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and the constant shifts @xmath5 is added to secure the energy of the fully polarized state to be zero",
    ".    it is known that there is a ground state phase transition at the point @xmath6@xcite . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the ground state is ferromagnetic . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the ground state is an incommensurate singlet with spiral spin correlations . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the ferromagnetic state is degenerate with the singlet state .",
    "one of the interesting problems in ground state properties is the critical behavior of the ground state energy at this transition point , which can be described by @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the coupled cluster method gave @xmath13@xcite .",
    "the perturbation theory based on the classical approximation gave @xmath14@xcite .",
    "however , by using jordan - wigner mean field theory , dmitriev and krivnov@xcite found recently that the critical exponent @xmath15 should be less than @xmath16 .",
    "later , they confirmed that @xmath17 by using scaling estimates of perturbation theory@xcite .    according to the previous results",
    ", it seems that the critical behavior of the ground state energy in the vicinity of the transition point is still a controversial problem , and more elaborate methods are needed to obtain a definitive result . as an important method in quantum magnetism , the spin wave theory often gives out significant reference results . to our knowledge , however , the spin wave theory in a regular way has not been applied to this problem . in this paper",
    ", we try to make up this blank .",
    "compared with previous work , our following treatment is easier and straightforward , and the final results have also some difference .",
    "in the classical picture of the ground state of the 1d f - af model , the spins are vectors which form the spiral structure with a pitch angle @xmath18 between neighboring spins in the @xmath19 plane , and all spin vectors have the same canted angle @xmath20 from the @xmath21 axis .",
    "we choose a reference state for the spin wave theory with all spin vectors point along the @xmath21 axis .",
    "so we define the new spin operators @xmath22 s , which are related to the original ones by the following rotational transformation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rotational operator about the @xmath25 axis by an angle @xmath20 , and @xmath26 is the rotational operator about the @xmath21 axis by an angle @xmath27 .    using the new spin operators , the hamiltonian ( [ eq01 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath28-\\frac{n(j_1+j_2)}{4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , and the coefficient functions are @xmath30.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    taking the linear spin - wave approximation@xcite : @xmath31 , and then the fourier transformation : @xmath32",
    ", we obtain the bosonic hamiltonian : @xmath33 where @xmath34-\\sum_m2sj_mf_{zz}(\\theta , m\\varphi),\\\\ b(\\theta,\\varphi , k)=\\sum_{m=1}^22sj_mf_{++}(\\theta , m\\varphi)\\cos mk,\\\\ e_0(\\theta,\\varphi)=n[\\sum_{m=1}^2s^2j_mf_{zz}(\\theta , m\\varphi)-\\frac{1}{4}(j_1+j_2)].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    we note here that the terms containing four bose - operators have been neglected as usually .",
    "the terms containing odd number of bose operators have been neglected as well according to the treatment in ref.@xcite , because they have no contribution to the energy in the mean - field approximation .",
    "it is only based on these approximations that we can obtain the above regular bosonic hamiltonian , and its effectiveness can be demonstrated by the results derived from it .",
    "in the following , we take @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the energy function @xmath37 is minimized at @xmath38",
    "the minimum of @xmath37 is just the classical ground state energy : @xmath39 which gives the critical behavior : @xmath40 as @xmath41 .    in order to obtain the quantum correction to the classical ground state energy , we use the double - time green s function approach@xcite to derive the zero - temperature average @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . by solving the group of equations of motion for the four green s functions : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and using the spectral theorem and taking the zero - temperature limit",
    ", we finally get : @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the pole of the above green s functions .    by taking eq.([eq02 ] ) and eq.([eq03 ] ) into the bosonic hamiltonian ( [ eq04 ] ) , we obtain the energy function per site including the quantum correction : @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and the quasimomentums @xmath55 is restricted in the region @xmath56 .",
    "the integral expression on the right side of eq.([eq05 ] ) is the quantum correction to the classical energy .",
    "based on this expression the critical behavior of the total ground state energy can be analyzed as follows .",
    "considering the values of @xmath20 and @xmath18 in the classical ground state , we take @xmath57 in eq.([eq05 ] ) and obtain the energy function @xmath58 . furthermore , from the relation @xmath59 , we get @xmath60 for @xmath41 . finally , the critical behavior of the total ground state energy can be described by the function : @xmath61    ( 12,8 ) ( 0,0)(color online ) the dependence of the ground state energy on @xmath62 given by eq.([eq06 ] ) ( solid line ) , @xmath14 of ref.@xcite ( short - dashed line ) , and @xmath63 of ref.@xcite ( long - dashed line).,title=\"fig : \" ] ( 1.5,2.5 )    ( 10,8 ) ( 1.5,-2)(color online ) the dependence of the ground state energy on @xmath62 given by eq.([eq06 ] ) ( solid line ) , @xmath14 of ref.@xcite ( short - dashed line ) , and @xmath63 of ref.@xcite ( long - dashed line).,title=\"fig : \" ]    fig.[fig1 ] shows that in the quite low region of @xmath62 our result calculated from eq.([eq06 ] ) is close to @xmath64 of ref.@xcite , while in the most part of the region @xmath65 our result is close to @xmath66 of ref@xcite .",
    "so from the calculation result , we can predict that the critical behavior of the ground state energy given by eq.([eq06 ] ) is @xmath67 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 with the limit @xmath41 . from fig.[fig2 ] , one can predict that @xmath70 .",
    "the curve of the function @xmath71 calculated from @xmath72 predicts the limit value @xmath73    .",
    "on the other hand , doing a regular expansion in powers of small parameter @xmath18 to the fourth order , and taking @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath75 with the coefficients : @xmath76 the quantum correction to the classical part of the ground state energy is @xmath77 which is consistent with the above numerical calculation .",
    "however , if we do the expansion to the sixth order , the integral for the coefficient @xmath78 is infrared - divergent .",
    "this fact may implicit the restriction on the effectiveness of our treatment to this model .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations and results derived from eq.([eq05 ] ) and eq.([eq06 ] ) seem reasonable , and the whole treatment is straightforward and easier than previous treatments .",
    "in this paper , the ground state energy of 1d f - af model ( [ eq01 ] ) in the vicinity of the transition point @xmath9 is considered . using the linear spin - wave approximation and the green s function approach in a very regular way",
    ", we obtain an integral expression eq.([eq05 ] ) for the ground state energy including the quantum correction .",
    "the critical behavior of the ground state energy is described by the function @xmath79 in eq.([eq06 ] ) , and the result is @xmath80 which is compared with the previous results in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it is known that the total energy of the @xmath81-magnon state of the model ( [ eq01 ] ) is @xmath82@xcite .",
    "the critical behavior of the ground state energy @xmath83 means that @xmath84 noninteracting magnons are created in the ground state .",
