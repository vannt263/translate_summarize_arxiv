    "it is widely accepted that gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows originate from the interaction of an ultrarelativistically expanding shell into the circumburst medium ( cbm ) .",
    "differences exists on the detailed kinematics and dynamics of such a shell ( see e.g. refs .   and refs . therein ) .    due to the ultrarelativistic velocity of the expanding shell ( lorentz gamma factor @xmath0 ) , photons emitted at the same time in the laboratory frame ( i.e. the one in which the center of the expanding shell is at rest ) from the shell surface but at different angles from the line of sight",
    "do not reach the observer at the same arrival time .",
    "therefore , if we were able to resolve spatially the grb afterglows , we would not see the spherical surface of the shell .",
    "we would see instead the projection on the celestial sphere of the equitemporal surface ( eqts ) , defined as the surface locus of points which are source of radiation reaching the observer at the same arrival time ( see e.g. refs .",
    "and refs . therein ) .",
    "the knowledge of the exact shape of the eqtss is crucial , since any theoretical model must perform an integration over the eqtss to compute any prediction for the observed quantities ( see e.g. refs .   and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "one of the key problems is the determination of the angular size of the visible region of each eqts , as well as the distribution of the luminosity over such a visible region . in the current literature",
    "it has been shown that in the latest afterglow phases the luminosity is maximum at the boundaries of the visible region and that the eqts must then appear as expanding luminous `` rings '' ( see e.g. refs .   and refs .",
    "therein ) . such an analysis is applied only in the latest afterglow phases to interpret data from radio observations @xcite or gravitational microlensing @xcite .",
    "the shell dynamics is usually assumed to be fully adiabatic and to be described by a power - law @xmath1 , following the blandford - mckee self similar solution@xcite , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the lorentz gamma factor and the radius of the expanding shell .",
    "such a power - law behavior has been extrapolated backward from the latest phases of the afterglow all the way to the prompt emission phase .    in refs .",
    "there have been presented the analytic solutions of the equations of motion for grb afterglow , compared with the above mentioned approximate solutions , both in the fully radiative and adiabatic regimes , and the corresponding analytic expressions for the eqtss .",
    "it has been shown that the approximate power - law regime can be asymptotically reached by the lorentz gamma factor only in the latest afterglow phases , when @xmath4 , and only if the initial lorentz gamma factor @xmath5 of the shell satisfies @xmath6 in the adiabatic case or @xmath7 in the radiative case .",
    "therefore , in no way the approximate power - law solution can be used to describe the previous dynamical phases of the shell , which are the relevant ones for the prompt emission and for the early afterglow .",
    "starting from these premises , in this paper we present the distribution of the extended afterglow luminosity over the visible region of a single eqtss within the `` fireshell '' model for grbs .",
    "such a model uses the exact solutions of the fireshell equations of motion and assumes a fully radiative dynamics ( see refs .",
    "therein for details ) .",
    "we recall that within the fireshell model the peak of the extended afterglow encompasses the prompt emission .",
    "we focus our analysis on the prompt emission and the early afterglow phases .",
    "our approach is therefore complementary to the other ones in the current literature , which analyze only the latest afterglow phases , and it clearly leads to new results when applied to the prompt emission phase . for simplicity , we consider only the bolometric luminosity@xcite , since during the prompt phase this is a good approximation of the one observed e.g. by bat or gbm instruments@xcite .",
    "the analysis is separately performed over different selected eqtss . the temporal evolution of the luminosity distribution over the eqtss visible region is presented . as a consequence of these results ,",
    "we show the novel feature that at the beginning of the prompt emission the most luminous regions of the eqtss are the ones closest to the line of sight . on the contrary , in the late prompt emission and in the early afterglow phases the most luminous eqts regions are the ones closest to the boundary of the visible region .",
    "this transition in the emitting region may lead to specific observational signatures , i.e. an anomalous spectral evolution , in the rising part or at the peak of the prompt emission .",
    "we also present an analytic expression for the temporal evolution , measured in arrival time , of the apparent radius of the eqtss in the sky .",
    "we finally discuss analogies and differences with other approaches in the current literature which assumes an adiabatic dynamics instead of a fully radiative one .",
    "for the case of a spherically symmetric fireshell considered in this letter , the eqtss are surfaces of revolution about the line of sight . the general expression for their profile , in the form @xmath8",
    ", corresponding to an arrival time @xmath9 of the photons at the detector , can be obtained from ( see e.g. ref .  ):",
