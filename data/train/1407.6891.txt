    "turbulent flows are considered to be smooth in the dissipation range of scales @xcite . below the viscous scale of the navier - stokes turbulence the internal friction of the fluid",
    "regularizes the irregular turbulent fluctuations in the inertial range turning the flow into laminar and differentiable . in the case of the bousinesq turbulence",
    "the regularization is done both by viscosity and heat conduction .",
    "we define @xmath0 as the dissipative scale below which both the flow and the scalar field coupled to it are smooth . in both cases",
    "the self - consistency of laminarity below @xmath0 demands decay of perturbations at scales smaller than @xmath0 .    in the navier - stokes turbulence",
    "the value of the viscous scale @xmath0 can be obtained from the demand that the viscous dissipation balances the non - linear advection term in the equation at this scale .",
    "otherwise said @xmath0 is fixed by demanding that the reynolds number based on this scale is of order one @xcite .",
    "that guarantees that the flow below @xmath0 is laminar smooth flow . in particular",
    "if one studies the temporal development of wave - packets with small amplitude sized below @xmath0 then the smallness of the reynolds number based on the packet s size guarantees that the fluctuation decays .",
    "thus the assumption of the flow laminarity below the scale @xmath0 is self - consistent .",
    "consider now the bousinesq turbulence that involves interaction of the flow with the scalar .",
    "using the velocity equation one can readily determine the scale @xmath5 at which the viscous dissipation balances the non - linear advection term in the equation .",
    "similarly , using the scalar equation one can readily determine the scale @xmath6 at which the heat conduction balances the non - linear advection term in the equation .",
    "however , in contrast to the navier - stokes turbulence , this does not guarantee that the wave - packets with size smaller than @xmath7 $ ] would decay .",
    "this is due to the coupling of the flow to the scalar field that produces the mechanism for the growth of fluctuations which is the same mechanism that underlies the convective instability .",
    "thus the demand that the heat conduction and viscosity terms dominate the advection ones in velocity and scalar equations separately does not guarantee the stability yet .    in this work",
    "we study the equations governing small perturbations at scales smaller than @xmath0 and demonstrate that the condition of decay of small fluctuations in the dissipation range produces a non - trivial inequality .",
    "this inequality can be considered as the condition of convective stability in the dissipative range .",
    "it is a remarkable consequence of the derived condition that the familiar linearly stable state of the vertically stratified fluid at rest turns unstable when rayleigh number , @xmath3 , measuring the relative importance of buoyancy and dissipative processes in the fluid , is large .",
    "this is based on the constraint s consequence that unless the scalar gradient points strictly in the direction of the gravity , the flow gets unstable in the limit @xmath8 . since in natural situations the direction of the scalar gradient fluctuates then the instability holds .",
    "the potential far - reaching consequences of this instability are to be studied .",
    "further we demonstrate that in the case of the turbulent boussinesq flow , the condition is obeyed by the known phenomenological relations . in the case of non - small prandtl number",
    "the flow parameters fit the condition precisely .",
    "it follows that the values of the dissipative scales can be considered as the condition of stability like in the navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "in contrast to that , in the case of small prandtl numbers there is a gap between the dissipative scales prescribed by the stability and those observed phenomenologically .",
    "the understanding of this gap demands further study .",
    "finally we use the stability condition to study the boussinesq flow around small particles .",
    "although the problem of translation of small particles through the viscous fluid has been studied intensively for centuries already @xcite , unexpectedly , a new result was found recently .",
    "non - trivial flow pattern was predicted for passive particles and self - propelled swimmers that move in the quiescent fluid when fluid s density stratification ( present invariably in many aquatic environments ) is taken into account @xcite .",
    "stratification produces intrinsic scale @xmath9 that characterizes interaction of dissipative processes ( characterized by kinematic viscosity @xmath10 and heat conductivity @xmath11 ) and gravity @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the density gradient normalized by the reference density . in the case of stable convection in the horizontal layer of a fluid of depth @xmath14 , @xmath15 . thus below",
    "we refer to @xmath2 as the rayleigh scale .",
    "in particular , the well - known threshold for convective instability corresponds to rayleigh scale becoming smaller than @xmath14 times a constant of order one depending on the type of boundary conditions @xcite .    in the fluid at rest",
    "the rayleigh scale is the scale at which the impact of stratification on the flow around small particle becomes appreciable . at smaller scales",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 is the particle s radius , the stratification is negligible and the usual stokes flow holds .",
    "however , at scales of order @xmath2 and larger instead of the stokes s streamlines that are open to infinity one finds closed streamlines and toroidal eddies @xcite .",
    "we show here that the flow decay at @xmath18 is exponential - like .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the slow algebraic ( inverse with the distance ) decay of the stokes flow .",
    "the obtained flow demonstrates that in spite of wide separation of scales of stratification ( kilometers ) and of particles or self - propelled microorganisms ( @xmath19  mm ) in typical marine environment , the stratification can not be neglected - the scale @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath20  mm .",
    "it was suggested that this previously unnoticed feature of the flow around small particles in the ocean may affect propulsion of small organisms and sinking of marine snow particles , diminish the effectiveness of mechanosensing in the ocean @xcite , stifle nutrient uptake of small motile organisms @xcite or potentially hinder the drift - induced biogenic mixing @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the above stratified flow in @xcite presumed constant gradient of the stratified agent .",
    "correspondingly the obtained flow is observable if @xmath21 where @xmath6 is the scale of spatial variations of the gradients .",
    "however , the stability condition derived in this work shows that quiescent stratified fluid with @xmath21 is stable only if the deviations @xmath22 of the scalar gradient @xmath23 from the direction of gravity , @xmath24 , are bounded by small parameter @xmath25 .",
    "since for @xmath26 the parameter @xmath25 is vanishingly small then it seems that the predicted flow is unlikely to occur in nature .    to resume , the problem with observability of the solution in @xcite , is that the flow involves intrinsic scale of the fluid @xmath2 that is independent of the particles size ( in contrast to , say , the oseen scale ) .",
    "then the condition of observability of the flow round the particle is the condition on the fluid flow itself , which realization is questionable due to convective instability holding when the gradients of the scalar have natural fluctuations from the vertical direction .",
    "we point out that it is not that the particle drives the rest state of the fluid considered in @xcite unstable , but rather that the rest state with considered parameters is not likely to occur in marine environments to begin with .",
    "the stability condition implies that the consideration of the flow round small particles and swimmers in the quiescent stratified fluid has natural applications only in the case @xmath27 ( unless there is strong limitation on the fluctuation of the gradients described in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "however , in order to consider the flow at scale @xmath2 in this case , one has to take into the spatial variation of the gradient of the background density .",
    "this complication both hinders analytic progress and makes the study non - universal .",
    "the flow would strongly depend on the way the gradient varies .",
    "thus we consider the universal situation where the flow is turbulent , which is by far the most common case in nature . in this case",
    "the stability condition implies that @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the practically important case of large prandtl numbers where the known phenomenological relations imply @xmath28 .",
    "we demonstrate that in this case the calculation of the flow is reduced to the study of scalar advection - diffusion equation .",
    "this equation is integro - differential .    despite the presence of turbulence , to leading order",
    "the flow at @xmath16 is still the stokes flow .",
    "we use the advection - diffusion equation to find the correction to that flow due to turbulence .",
    "we succeed in finding exact formula for the magnitude of fluctuations due to turbulence in terms of the energy dissipation rate @xmath29 .",
    "finally we construct the asymptotic solutions to the flow at the scale @xmath2 .",
    "these demonstrate that with finite probability there are closed streamlines .",
    "it should be emphasized that the results are obtained without modelling the statistics of turbulence and they can be directly applied to natural environments .",
    "in this section we consider the behavior of infinitesimal small - scale perturbations in the boussinesq flow that describes interaction of the flow with the stratifying agent , by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the fluid velocity , @xmath32 the fluid density normalized by the reference value @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the properly defined pressure @xcite and @xmath35 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the force @xmath36 represents either a body force and/or a boundary force .",
    "we demonstrate that there is a range of parameters for which the infinitesimal small - scale fluctuations would grow exponentially .",
    "it is to be stressed that besides smoothness ( existence of finite scales of temporal and spatial variation of the fields ) no assumptions are made on the flow . in particular",

    "though @xmath32 itself is dominated by the large - scale fluctuations at the outer scale of the flow @xmath37 , the fluctuations of the gradients @xmath38 are dominated by the scale @xmath6 .",

    "in this work we derived the stability condition that holds for arbitrary boussinesq flow which is smooth below a certain scale @xmath0 . this is generalization of the classical convective stability condition which derivation is possible thanks to universal spatial behaviour of the flow at scales smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "the flow there can be described by linear profile corresponding to the first term in the taylor series .",
    "the condition is the demand that small perturbations below the scale @xmath0 decay in order to preserve the laminarity of the flow in that region ( at larger scales the flow can be turbulent ) .",

    "we prove that the flow with @xmath510 is unstable with respect to growth of small fluctuations at scales smaller than @xmath0 .",

    "the first conclusion that we draw from the stability condition is that quiescent stratified fluids are unstable in the limit of large rayleigh numbers , @xmath3 .",
    "this is because @xmath513 is finite in nature .",
    "this poses the question of finding the realistic behaviour of stratified fluid in @xmath8 limit . to address this question we propose introduction of the random source of fluctuations of @xmath23 into the equations and look for a new steady state .",
    "our work implies that this state is likely not to be close to the state of quiescent stratified fluid ( unless the non - linear terms arrest the fluctuations growth at weak non - linearity which seems unlikely ) .",
    "this new steady state may shed light on the puzzle of the layered structure of the density in the ocean which origin is not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "it is left for future work .    applying the @xmath511 condition to the study of the turbulent boussinesq flow",
    "we find that the previously derived phenomenological relations @xcite can be understood as the condition of stability of the flow when the prandtl number , @xmath55 , is not small and the nusselt number @xmath4 is not too large .",
    "similarly to how in the navier - stokes turbulence one can understand the viscous scale as the one at which the flow becomes laminar ( the reynolds number at the viscous scale is of order one @xcite ) so in this case of boussinesq turbulence the dissipation scale @xmath0 can be understood as the scale at which the dissipative processes regularize the convective instability . in contrast , the phenomenological relations diverge from the stability condition in the limits @xmath514 or @xmath52 .",
    "the reason for this divergence is to be studied in the future .",
    "finally we consider the implications of the stability condition to the flow of small particle in arbitrary background flow .",
    "the small particle can be considered as the source of the flow fluctuations .",
    "the stability with respect to those fluctuations implies that the recently found solution for the flow around small particle in quiescent stratified fluid @xcite seems to be highly limited in scope .",
    "it was demonstrated that the flow around small particle moving in the quiescent stratified fluid with constant gradient @xmath126 has a non - trivial structure of closed streamlines at the scale @xmath2 beyond which the flow decays rapidly @xcite . however , the constancy of the gradient implies the condition @xmath212 of observability of this flow . using the stability condition derived in this work",

    "considering the flow with @xmath515 we describe quantitatively the rate of decay of the flow at scales larger than @xmath2 ( this decay was addressed in @xcite numerically without quantitative conclusions ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the flow decays inversely with the distance to the power nine .",
    "due to the high exponent of the power law this algebraic decay seems to be practically indistinguishable from the exponential one , which we prove by computing the solution numerically .",
    "the regime with @xmath516 is likely to hold very rarely , if at all , in typical marine environments .",
    "this is due to intrinsic presence of fluctuations in stratification gradient bringing finite @xmath513 .",
    "this poses the question of finding the flow around small particle in boussinesq flows which is relevant to nature .",
    "we consider the most practical case of the particle translating in the turbulent boussinesq flow .",
    "there are two regions in the perturbation flow caused by the particle . below the rayleigh scale",
    "the flow is close to the usual stokes flow .",
    "we succeeded in deriving analytic formulas for the correction to the stokes flow in that region demonstrating that the leading order correction is a small constant drift .",
    "since drift correction can accumulate bringing finite effects this poses the question of practical implications of this correction .",
    "direct generalization of our calculation can be used to describe the corrections to the stokes force on the particle due to stratification .",
    "in contrast at the rayleigh scale the flow is very different from the stokes flow .",
    "we demonstrated that in the practically relevant regime of large prandtl numbers the flow can be described by one scalar integro - differential advection - diffusion equation ( [ form ] ) instead of the complete system of four hydrodynamic equations .",
    "we propose this equation as efficient tool for the numerical study of the flow round small particles in stratified turbulent flow .",
    "though the closed - form solution to that equation can not be obtained , we succeed in constructing the solution that holds by the order of magnitude providing valid qualitative description of the solutions .",
    "this indicates that the closed streamlines holding for quiescent stratified background persist for the turbulent background with finite probability .",
    "the structure of those lines is different being random though .",
    "the numerical study of the statistics of the flow near small particles in boussinesq turbulence and the corresponding probabilities is left for future work .",
