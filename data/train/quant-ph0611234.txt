    "the theory of games provides a general structure within which both cooperation and competition among independent entities may be modeled , and provides powerful tools for analyzing these models .",
    "applications of this theory have fundamental importance in many areas of science .",
    "this paper considers games in which the players may exchange and process quantum information .",
    "we focus on competitive games , and within this context the types of games we consider are very general .",
    "for instance , they allow multiple rounds of interaction among the players involved , and place no restrictions on players strategies beyond those imposed by the theory of quantum information .    while classical games can be viewed as a special case of quantum games , it is important to stress that there are fundamental differences between general quantum games and classical games .",
    "for example , the two most standard representations of classical games , namely the _ normal form _ and _ extensive form _ representations , are not directly applicable to general quantum games .",
    "this is due to the nature of quantum information , which admits a continuum of pure ( meaning extremal ) strategies , imposes bounds on players knowledge due to the uncertainty principle , and precludes the representation of general computational processes as trees . in light of such issues ,",
    "it is necessary to give special consideration to the incorporation of quantum information into the theory of games .",
    "a general theory of quantum games has the potential to be useful in many situations that arise in quantum cryptography , computational complexity , communication complexity , and distributed computation .",
    "this potential is the primary motivation for the work presented in this paper , which we view as a first step in the development of a general theory of quantum games .",
    "the following facts are among those proved in this paper :    * every multiple round quantum strategy can be faithfully represented by a single positive semidefinite operator acting only on the tensor product of the input and output spaces of the given player .",
    "this representation is a generalization of the choi - jamiokowski representation of super - operators .",
    "the set of all operators that arise in this way is precisely characterized by the set of positive semidefinite operators that satisfy a simple collection of linear constraints .",
    "* if a multiple round quantum strategy calls for one or more measurements then its representation consists of one operator for each of the possible measurement outcomes .",
    "the probability of any given pair of measurement outcomes for two interacting strategies is given by the inner product of their associated operators .",
    "* the maximum probability with which a given strategy can be forced to output a particular result is the _ minimum _ value of @xmath1 for which the positive semidefinite operator corresponding to the given measurement result is bounded above ( with respect to the lwner partial order ) by the representation of a valid strategy multiplied by  @xmath1 .",
    "we give the following applications of these facts :    * a new and conceptually simple proof of kitaev s bound for strong coin - flipping , which states that every quantum strong coin - flipping protocol allows a bias of at least @xmath2 . *",
    "the exact characterization @xmath0 of the class of problems having quantum refereed games ( i.e. , quantum interactive proof systems with two competing provers ) .",
    "this establishes that quantum and classical refereed games are equivalent in terms of expressive power : @xmath3 .",
    "it is appropriate for us to comment on the relationship between the present paper and a fairly large collection of papers written on a topic that has been called _",
    "quantum game theory_. meyer s _ pq penny flip _",
    "game @xcite is a well - known example of a game in the category these papers consider .",
    "the work of eisert , _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite is also commonly cited in this area .",
    "some controversy exists over the interpretations drawn in some quantum these papers  see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a key difference between our work and previous work on quantum game theory is that our focus is on multiple - round interactions .",
    "understanding the actions available to players that have quantum memory is therefore critical to our work , and to our knowledge has not been previously considered in the context of quantum game theory .",
    "a second major difference is that , in most of the previous quantum game theory papers we are aware of , the focus is on rather specific examples of classical games and on identifying differences that arise when so - called quantum variants of these games are considered . as a possible consequence , it may arguably be said that none of the results proved in these papers has had sufficient generality to be applicable to any other studies in quantum information .",
    "in contrast , our interest is not on specific examples of games , but rather on the development of a general theory that holds for all games .",
    "it remains to be seen to what extent our work will be applied , but the applications that we provide suggest that it may have interesting uses in other areas of quantum information and computation .",
    "a different context in which games arise in quantum information theory is that of _ nonlocal games _",
    "@xcite , which include _ pseudo - telepathy games _ @xcite as a special case .",
    "these are cooperative games of incomplete information that model situations that arise in the study of multiple - prover interactive proof systems , and provide a framework for studying bell inequalities and the notion of nonlocality that arises in quantum physics .",
    "while such games can be described within the general setting we consider , we have not yet found an application of the methods of the present paper to this type of game .",
    "possibly there is some potential for further development of our work to shed light on some of the difficult questions in this area .",
    "this section gives a brief overview of various quantum information - theoretic notions that will be needed for the remainder of the paper .",
    "we assume the reader has familiarity with quantum information theory , and intend only that this overview will serve to establish our notation and highlight the main concepts that we will need .",
    "readers not familiar with quantum information are referred to the books of nielsen and chuang @xcite and kitaev , shen and vyalyi @xcite .",
    "when we speak of the vector space associated with a given quantum system , we are referring to some complex euclidean space ( by which we mean a finite - dimensional inner product space over the complex numbers ) .",
    "such spaces will be denoted by capital script letters such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we always assume that an orthonormal _ standard basis _ of any such space has been chosen , and with respect to this basis elements of these spaces are associated with column vectors , and linear mappings from one space to another are associated with matrices in the usual way .",
    "we will often be concerned with finite sequences @xmath7 of complex euclidean spaces .",
    "we then define @xmath8 for nonnegative integers @xmath9 , and define @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "it is convenient to define various sets of linear mappings between given complex euclidean spaces @xmath4 and  @xmath5 as follows .",

    "an operator @xmath18 is a _ linear isometry _ if @xmath19 .",
    "the existence of a linear isometry in @xmath12 of course requires that @xmath20 , and if @xmath21 then any linear isometry @xmath18 is unitary .",

    "for given operators @xmath26 , the notation @xmath27 means that @xmath28 .",
    "this relation is sometimes called the _ lwner partial order _ on @xmath15 .    when we refer to _ measurements _ , we mean povm - type measurements .",
    "formally , a measurement on a complex euclidean space @xmath4 is described by a collection of positive semidefinite operators @xmath29 satisfying the constraint @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a finite , non - empty set of _ measurement outcomes_. if a state represented by the density operator @xmath32 is measured with respect to such a measurement , each outcome @xmath33 results with probability @xmath34 .",
    "a _ super - operator _ is a linear mapping of the form @xmath35 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are complex euclidean spaces .",
    "a super - operator of this form is said to be _ positive _ if @xmath36 for every choice of @xmath37 , and is _ completely positive _ if @xmath38 is positive for every choice of a complex euclidean space @xmath6 .",
    "the super - operator @xmath39 is said to be _",
    "admissible _ if it is completely positive and preserves trace : @xmath40 for all @xmath41 .",
    "admissible super - operators represent discrete - time changes in quantum systems that can , in an idealized sense , be physically realized .    the choi - jamiokowski representation @xcite of super - operators is as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath42 be a given super - operator and let @xmath43 be the standard basis of @xmath4 .",
    "then the _ choi - jamiokowski representation _ of @xmath39 is the operator @xmath44 it holds that @xmath39 is completely positive if and only if @xmath45 is positive semidefinite , and that @xmath39 is trace - preserving if and only if @xmath46 .    for two complex euclidean spaces @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we define a linear mapping @xmath47 by extending by linearity the action @xmath48 on standard basis states . we make extensive use of this mapping in some of our proofs , as it is very convenient in a variety of situations .",

    "it is a completely natural assumption that alice and bob play independent strategies in a zero - sum quantum refereed game , given that it can not simultaneously be to both players advantage to communicate directly with one another or to initially share an entangled state .",
