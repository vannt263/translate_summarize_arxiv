    "we dedicate our contribution to the memory of george stell with whom the loup verlet s orsay group has shared a long - lasting friendship .",
    "this study is devoted to a monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system made of identical dipolar hard disks ( dhd ) in the euclidian plane @xmath2 in the presence of an uniform external electrostatic field @xmath3 .",
    "the dipoles are assumed to be permanent and the configurational energy of @xmath4 dipolar molecules in @xmath2 reads as @xmath5   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\mu \\sum_{i = 1 } ^{n } \\mathbf{s}_i \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{e } } \\nonumber   \\\\   \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .  , @xmath6 is the hard disk potential of diameter @xmath7 .",
    "the second term is the contribution from the 2d dipole - dipole interaction where @xmath8 , @xmath9 permanent dipole moment , @xmath10 unit vector in the direction of the dipole moment of particle @xmath11 , @xmath12 , the vector joining the centres of mass of the particles , and @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the last term denotes the interaction energy of the dipoles with the external field @xmath0 which is assumed to be uniform .",
    "we note that the dipole - dipole interaction involved in eq .   is derived from the solution of the 2d laplace equation in the plane .",
    "this model was studied recently in the absence of @xmath0 by means of mc simulations performed on a sphere and in a square with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc )  @xcite . in both cases the laws of electrostatics governing the interactions in the considered geometries",
    "were scrupulously adopted yielding identical phase diagrams . at high temperature and moderate density an ordinary polar fluid",
    "is observed characterized by a dielectric constant @xmath14 . in the low temperature , low density part of the phase diagram",
    "a phase of living polymers of dipoles organized into closed rings has been observed . at higher density the structure of this phase",
    "is characterized by an entangled structure of chains and rings and the dielectric constant @xmath14 is no more well - defined .",
    "it was found that the critical dipole moment @xmath15 at the transition from fluid to polymeric phase increases slightly with density .    in the presence of an applied field , in the low temperature phase",
    "the dipole moments are expected to align in the direction of the field , the tendency getting more effective as the strength of @xmath0 increases , first yielding roughly linear chains which ultimately will collapse into bundle - like structures at high density . as it is impossible to consider uniform fields on the sphere ( without violating the laws of electrostatics , cf .",
    "@xcite ) we present here only simulations performed of dhd contained in a square with pbc .",
    "let us first recall some elements of electrostatics for a square of side @xmath17 along directions @xmath18 with pbc , which will be referred to as space @xmath19  @xcite .      the electric field at point @xmath20 ( @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 orthonormal basis of @xmath19 ) created by a point dipole @xmath23 located at point @xmath24 of @xmath19 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the bare dipolar green s function and the dot a tensorial contraction ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the green s function @xmath26 depends on the considered geometry and is given in @xmath19 by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the periodic ewald potential .",
    "the latter satisfies poisson s equation in @xmath19 , _",

    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 is a @xmath16 vector with integer components @xmath33 in the basis @xmath22 .",
    "one notes that @xmath28 identifies with the potential created by a unit point charge immersed in a uniform neutralizing background of charge density @xmath34 .",
    "expanding @xmath28 and @xmath35 in fourier series one finds    @xmath36    where @xmath37 .",
    "some comments on the previous developments are in order :    * \\(i ) it follows from eq .   that @xmath38 and therefore the electric field created by a uniform polarization @xmath39 is zero ( see sec .  ) .",
    "* \\(ii ) clearly @xmath35 exhibits the same singularity for @xmath40 as the green s function of the infinite euclidean plane @xmath41 , _",

    "@xmath44 is an arbitrary small cutoff ultimately set to zero if point dipoles are to be considered .",
    "it must be understood that any integral involving @xmath45 must be calculated with @xmath46 and then taking the limit @xmath47 . in the presence of hard cores , as in the dhd fluid , the point dipoles can be replaced by a continuous charge distribution of symmetry axis @xmath48 and charge density @xmath49 . in that case",
    "@xmath44 can be chosen to take any value @xmath50 . *",
    "\\(iii ) the interaction energy of two dipoles of @xmath19 is given by @xmath51 .",
    "as well - known , expression   can not be handled in a straightforward way in mc simulations since it converges very slowly .",
    "this fourier series is then splitted into two series , one in direct space , the other in fourier space , both with good convergence properties . in that way one obtains the dipolar ewald potential",

    "we consider a line of length @xmath17 , parallel to axis @xmath52 of a square with pbc , which bears a continuous distribution of dipoles @xmath53 where the components @xmath54 are constants . without loss of generality the equation of the line can be chosen as @xmath55 .",
    "the electric field @xmath56 created by this infinitesimal dipole at point @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 the total field of the line is obtained by integration    @xmath59   \\mathbf{e}_x   \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq .",
    "shows that the field of a uniform distribution of dipoles aligned along the line @xmath55 ( @xmath60 ) vanishes exactly .",
    "this result should be compared with the expression of the field created by an infinite linear chain of point dipoles , each with dipole moment @xmath61 , all aligned along the @xmath52 axis with spacing @xmath62 given in ref .",
    "the latter is expressed as a series , the dominant term of which behaves as @xmath63 . with the correspondence @xmath64 and in the limit of a continuous distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath65 with @xmath66 fixed , this dominant term vanishes in agreement with our result .",
    "these results suggest that in the polymeric phase and in the presence of a sufficiently large external field the chains of dipoles aligned along the field do not contribute significantly to the maxwell field .",
    "this point has been checked in our simulations and is discussed in sec .  .",
    "the expression   of @xmath67 also shows that , apart from the singularity @xmath68 , a uniform electric field parallel to the axis @xmath69 of strength @xmath70 can be generated by a uniform distribution of dipoles perpendicular to the line ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "in passing we note that the delta singularity has no effect in actual simulations since the condition @xmath55 , of measure zero , is never obtained .",
    "we also remark that @xmath66 being fixed , the field vanishes in the limit @xmath72 as it should be , since then the result of the euclidean plane @xmath41 with free boundaries at infinity should be recovered . the electrostatic potential obtained by integration ,",
    "is found , up to an arbitrary additional constant , to be @xmath73 yielding the expected discontinuity of the potential across a dipole layer@xcite @xmath74 these results can be extended to the @xmath75 case ( with @xmath76 replaced by @xmath77 ) where one should consider instead a planar uniform layer of dipoles aligned along the normal to the square @xmath55 of the cube @xmath78 .",
    "we stress that it seems to be the only way to generate a uniform electrostatic field within pbc cubic geometries .      at thermal equilibrium",
    "the maxwell field @xmath79 is the sum of the external field @xmath80 and the field created by the dipoles @xmath81 .",
    "it follows from sec .",
    "that , in a given configuration of @xmath4 dipoles in the canonical ensemble , the microscopic field @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 where the microscopic polarization at point @xmath57 reads @xmath84 at equilibrium we thus have @xmath85 where the macroscopic polarization @xmath86 .    for a fluid in a uniform external field",
    "@xmath3 the polarization @xmath39 is uniform and , for a sufficiently low field strength , @xmath87 , which defines the dielectric constant @xmath88 .",
    "as well known  @xcite the relation between the maxwell field and the external field depends on the geometry .",
    "for instance , in the plane @xmath41 with free boundaries at infininity we have @xmath89 while , in @xmath19 we have @xmath90 \\cdot \\mathbf{p } \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\                        & = \\mathbf{0 } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a consequence of eq .",
    "from which it follows that @xmath91 and therefore @xmath92 .",
    "for the present planar system the mc simulations were performed in a square of surface @xmath93 with pbc for @xmath94 hard disks carrying a dipole moment , in reduced units , @xmath95 varying between @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the densities , in reduced units , were taken in the range @xmath98 from 0.1 to 0.3 .",
    "the energy @xmath99 of the system in the presence of the external field @xmath100 is calculated , taking into account the pbc , by the ewald summation technique explicated in refs @xcite .",
    "the expression at point @xmath101 of the microscoipic field @xmath102 due to the @xmath4 dipoles @xmath103 is thus given by @xmath104 where we have reported in the second line of eq .",
    "the ewald expression used in our simulations .",
    "the parameter @xmath105 regulates the rate of convergence of the sums in direct and fourier space .    at equilibrium",
    "the maxwell , or macroscopic field is defined as @xmath106 where the brackets denote a canonical average , while the macroscopic polarization is the canonical average of @xmath107 . in the region of the phase diagram where it is a defined quantity and in the limit of small fields ,",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath14 of the system can be obtained , as discussed in sec .  , through @xmath108 .    in the simulations the external field @xmath109",
    "is chosen parallel to the @xmath52 axis and the microscopic field @xmath102 is calculated for an ensemble of @xmath110 points located at the grid points of a square lattice .",
    "it is calculated even if the point @xmath101 is inside the hard core of the disk .",
    "hence the possibility of a rare but large contribution to @xmath111 , which is avoided by setting to zero the values @xmath112 in the tabulation of the gaussian functions in eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "clearly it amounts to compute @xmath113 where the truncated green function @xmath114 is that of eq .  .",
    "it follows then from eq .   that @xmath115    the maxwell field has been computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) for the thermodynamic states given in table i. for dipole moment @xmath96 , and all densities considered , the system reaches equilibrium after of the order of @xmath116 mc trial moves per particle and about @xmath117 mc trial moves per particle appear sufficient to evaluate the canonical averages with a precision of @xmath118 .",
    "such a sampling is also sufficient to achieve average values of @xmath119 at the different grid points @xmath120 independent of @xmath121 for all considered values of the external field .    for dipole moments @xmath122 or @xmath97 , a configuration of the system",
    "is typically characterized by the formation of chains and rings .",
    "such an arrangement of the disks evolves to a different but similar arrangement only within @xmath116 trial moves per particle and therefore of the order of @xmath123 trial moves per particle are necessary for the estimate of the canonical averages and to obtain an average value of @xmath124 quasi - independent of @xmath121 .",
    "figures 1 provides snapshots of such an evolution at @xmath125 for @xmath122 and @xmath126 .",
    "the results of table i show that for all thermodynamic states considered the average value @xmath127 @xmath128 as @xmath129 cancels @xmath130 in the limit of statistical errors .",
    "this result allows to obtain two estimates of the dielectric constant @xmath14 in the limit of small external fields , one , denoted @xmath131 , by @xmath132 the other , denoted @xmath133 , by @xmath134    .maxwell field and dielectric constant for thermodynamics states at low and high reduced dipole moments and for densities @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath131 and @xmath133 are computed from eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , respectively . at @xmath137 , the evaluation of @xmath14",
    "is precluded by the metastability of the thermodynamic states . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    "for @xmath138 and @xmath96 the two estimates of @xmath14 are in excellent agreement for all values @xmath139 .",
    "this value of @xmath140 is also in agreement with the value @xmath141 determined by the fluctuation formula @xcite at @xmath142 , @xmath143 where @xmath144 . at @xmath126 and @xmath122",
    "the estimated value of @xmath14 is equal to @xmath145 if @xmath146 ; for @xmath147 the estimated values lie between @xmath148 and @xmath149 , a dispersion corresponding to the fact that after more then @xmath123 trial moves per particle the statistical error on @xmath150 remains of the order of @xmath151 .",
    "the estimated value is in agreement with that , @xmath152 , obtained from the fluctuation formula .    at @xmath138 and @xmath137 ,",
    "the field @xmath153 is also zero in the limit of statistical errors , demonstrating that within the performed trial moves , the values of @xmath154 and @xmath155 remain coherent such that the maxwell field remains equal to the external field .",
    "however , it is manifest that for @xmath137 , sampling of configurations is affected by strong metastability as shown by comparison of the average polarizations , obtained with @xmath156 and @xmath157 trials per particle , using different initial conditions . in one of the runs , starting from an unpolarized initial configuration , the average final polarization is @xmath158 ( first line of table i ) , whereas in a run starting from an initial configuration with a polarization close to the maximal polarization @xmath159 , the average final polarization is equal to @xmath160 ( second line of table i ) .",
    "snapshots of characteristic configurations for these two states are given in figure 2 .",
    "similarly at @xmath161 , for two runs with different initial configuration , the polarizations seem stable for a sampling of @xmath162 trials per particle , with values @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively .",
    "this important metastability affecting the polarization values precludes a reliable calculation of @xmath14 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) or ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "a 2d dipolar system with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of a uniform external field behaves according to the laws of electrostatics .",
    "this result allows to show by numerical simulation that the maxwell field inside the system is equal to the applied external field even if the system is highly polarized and also for stable or possibly metastable states where the configurations of the system are dominated by chaines and rings .",
    "this equality between maxwell and external field does , however , not permit to overcome the difficulties inherent in the determination of the dielectric constant of the system at low temperature .",
