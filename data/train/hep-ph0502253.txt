    "the skyrme model @xcite was originally formulated to provide a description of baryons as topological solitons of finite energy emerging in the framework of a nonlinear theory of weakly coupled pions fields .",
    "nowadays , this idea is partly supported by the @xmath3 analysis @xcite , according to which the low - energy limit of qcd could be represented by an effective theory of infinitely many mesons fields whose derivatives appear to all - orders . since little",
    "is known about the exact form of such a lagrangian , significant efforts have been made to formulate in a simple way skyrme - like effective lagrangians @xcite .",
    "it was then possible to improve the phenomenological predictions for the spherically symmetric skyrmion with unit topological charge @xmath4 @xcite with higher order lagrangians , whereas only a relative accord with experimental data was achieved with the original skyrme model @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , analysis based on axially symmetric ansatz @xcite and full numerical studies @xcite have shown that the angular distribution of static skyrme fields is not accurately reproduced by the spherically symmetric hedgehog ansatz in the general context of topological charges @xmath5 .",
    "for the case of models containing higher order terms , not much is known for these @xmath5 and the angular configuration of skyrmions needs to be investigated in greater details .",
    "a few steps towards this has been made in @xcite and more recently in @xcite for a skyrme model extended to order six in derivatives of the pion fields assuming an axially symmetric solution .    in this work , we use a simulated annealing algorithm to minimize the static energy functional of order six and order eight extended skyrme models for baryonic numbers @xmath1 to @xmath2 , following the approach in @xcite where this numerical method was used to solve the skyrme model .",
    "no specific ansatz is used to get the minimum energy solutions .",
    "the essence of simulated annealing ( sa ) relies on the analogy that can be made with a solid which is slowly cooled down , stating that if thermal equilibrium is achieved at each temperature during the cooling process , the solid will eventually reach its ground state .",
    "the first application of this idea to optimization problems like the minimization of energy functionals has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "we use a similar strategy where sa describes the cooling process of our system and a metropolis algorithm @xcite brings it into thermal equilibrium .",
    "the main advantage of this method over other techniques is that it only involves the energy density and there is no need to write or solve directly a set of differential equations that become more complex as the order of the lagrangian increases .",
    "the exact soliton solutions that we obtain with the sa algorithm also constitute a valuable comparison tool to study the rational maps approximation for skyrme fields in the case of generalized models .",
    "this approximation works quite well for the skyrme model @xcite , and one might conjecture that a rational map based ansatz would accurately depict the solutions of extended skyrme models in general .",
    "interestingly , it has been demonstrated that adding a sixth order term in derivatives of the pion fields to the skyrme lagrangian does not compromise the reliability of the rational maps ansatz @xcite .",
    "conversely , when a pion mass term is introduced , the symmetries of the skyrmions differ from those of the original skyrme model for higher topological sectors @xcite , making the use of rational maps inappropriate .",
    "thus , it is pertinent to test further this ansatz for other extensions of the skyrme model .    in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief account on the structure of the skyrme model and some of its extensions .",
    "then , in section [ sec : ratmaps ] , we review the rational maps ansatz and use it to write a static energy functional for generalized skyrme models . as an aside",
    ", we introduce a new positivity constraint on the models proposed in @xcite in section [ sec : positivity ] .",
    "comparison with rational maps ansatz requires a finite order lagrangian , which motivates our choice to restrict our analysis to order - six and order - eight models .",
    "section [ sec : simann ] provides a rather detailed description of the sa algorithm we use in three spatial dimensions , leading to exact soliton solutions , and the one we use in one spatial dimension to minimize the radial energy functional of the skyrmion , where the angular dependence has already been integrated out as a result of the use of rational maps .",
    "finally , we discuss the validity and the limits of our sa results in section [ sec : results ] , where we also draw conclusions concerning the symmetries of the skyrmions we obtain and the reliability of the rational maps ansatz .",
    "the @xmath0 skyrme model lagrangian density for zero pion mass takes the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a left - handed chiral current and @xmath8   $ ] .",
    "the @xmath0 chiral field @xmath9 is a matrix whose degrees of freedom can be parametrized in terms of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 fields using @xmath12 with @xmath13 , providing then a link with a nonlinear pion theory .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : skyrme_lag ] ) coincides with the nonlinear sigma model which admits soliton solutions that are unstable with regard to a scale transformation .",
    "skyrme proposed to add a term of order four in derivatives of the pion fields , the second term in ( [ eq : skyrme_lag ] ) , to stabilize the solitons and account for nucleon - nucleon interactions via pion exchange .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is the pion decay coupling and @xmath15 is a constant dimensionless coupling .",
    "both parameters are usually fixed using nucleon properties . choosing an appropriate change of variables , we rewrite from hereon the lagrangian density ( [ eq : skyrme_lag ] ) using units of length @xmath16 and of energy @xmath17 leading to @xmath18    to obtain finite energy solutions",
    ", the field configuration @xmath9 must respect the boundary condition @xmath19 at spatial infinity , stating that this map from @xmath20 to @xmath0 goes to the trivial vacuum for asymptotically large distances .",
    "each mapping @xmath9 is characterized by an integer topological invariant , the winding number .",
    "skyrme associated this conserved quantity with the baryon number @xmath21    from physical grounds , the order - four stabilizing term added by skyrme in ( [ eq : skyrme_lag ] ) is somewhat arbitrary as it leads to a chiral theory which is expected to be valid only at low momenta .",
    "so , the search for an effective lagrangian more appropriate for the description of low - energy qcd properties prompted naturally the inclusion of higher - order terms in derivatives of the pion fields to the skyrme model .",
    "but even writing the most general higher - order lagrangian rapidly becomes a cumbersome task as the number of terms increases with the number of derivatives let alone finding any solutions . in view of this difficulty",
    ", we choose to consider only a class of tractable models defined in @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a choice will be explained in the next sections . for now , let us mention that chiral symmetry is preserved to all - orders in derivatives of the pion fields . following this scheme ,",
    "the most general lagrangian @xmath22 takes the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 are respectively terms of order two , four and six in derivatives of the pion fields .",
    "any higher - order lagrangians can be written in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 according to the recursion formula@xmath27 or using a generating function @xcite . for our 3d simulations , it is convenient to parametrize the four degrees of freedom by @xmath28 with @xmath29  such that @xmath30 these fields are related to the @xmath10 and pion fields according to @xmath31 the previous lagrangians then take the form @xmath32 , \\\\ \\mathcal{l}_{3 }   &   = \\frac{1}{2}~(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi_{m}\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi _ { m})^{3}-\\frac{3}{2}~(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi_{m}\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi_{m}% ) ( \\partial_{\\nu}\\phi_{n}\\partial_{\\lambda}\\phi_{n})^{2}\\\\ &   + ( \\partial_{\\mu}\\phi_{m}\\partial_{\\nu}\\phi_{m})(\\partial^{\\nu}\\phi _ { n}\\partial^{\\lambda}\\phi_{n})(\\partial_{\\lambda}\\phi_{l}\\partial^{\\mu}% \\phi_{l}).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the static energy density emerging from those lagrangians can be written in terms of three invariants @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 manton has shown that these invariants have a simple geometrical interpretation @xcite .",
    "they correspond to the eigenvalues of the strain tensor @xmath37 in the theory of elasticity , i.e. the square of the length changes of the images of any orthonormal system in the space manifold @xmath20 under the conformal map @xmath9 onto the group manifold @xmath38 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 may be interpreted as @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the total energy density associated with a model",
    "can then be recast as @xmath45 where @xmath46    let us now introduce the hedgehog ansatz @xmath47   , \\label{eq : hegehog}%\\ ] ] where the @xmath48 are the three pauli matrices and the @xmath49 are the three components of a radial unit vector .",
    "this form ( [ eq : hegehog ] ) is known to minimize the static energy of @xmath1 skyrmions .",
    "the exact solution requires the numerical computation of the chiral angle @xmath50 . using this ansatz for general lagrangians ( [ eq : l ] )",
    ", we may write the static energy density @xmath51 which is at most quadratic in @xmath52 @xmath53 since the hedgehog ansatz , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the skyrme model corresponds to the particular case @xmath56 . minimizing ( [ eq : densite_e ] ) using",

    "\\label{eq : chiral_equation}%\\ ] ] this differential equation is at most of degree two , thus computationaly tractable .",
    "such a requirement was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the skyrme model or any model made up of a linear combination of @xmath58 and @xmath26 satisfy this condition so in a sense , the models we are interested in are their natural extensions . as we shall see , the sa algorithm minimizes energy functionals directly , and therefore there is no need to invoque euler - lagrange formalism and to write down the corresponding differential equations .",
    "the hedgehog ansatz is particularly useful for the @xmath1 solutions , which have been shown to possess spherical symmetry .",
    "this is not the case for higher topological sectors whose symmetries are fortunately well approximated by the rational maps ansatz .",
    "it has been shown @xcite by numerical work that the static skyrme solitons of charge @xmath59 are not radially symmetric . in that context , the hedgehog ansatz needs to be replaced by a more general ansatz in order to reproduce the specific angular distributions of multi - skyrmions .",
    "hopefully , there exists an ansatz based on rational maps @xcite which constitutes a very good approximation for @xmath5 skyrmions .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to evaluate the static energy of @xmath1 to @xmath2 skyrmions using the rational maps ansatz , and then compare these results with the exact numerical ones we obtain for several chiral models",
    ". this strategy will give us keen information on the reliability of the ansatz for certain extended skyrme models , which is currently unknown , in particular for a model comprising an order eight extension . a correspondence between exact and rational maps solutions",
    "would then allow one to determine the symmetries of an exact numerical solution from the analysis of the matching rational map .",
    "a priori there seems to be no reason why the rational map ansatz should provide good approximation for solutions of extended models unless these models are numerically very close to the skyrme model .",
    "however , looking at the energy density ( [ energabc ] ) , one realizes that when the two invariants @xmath60 and @xmath34 ( which are identified with the angular distribution in our case ) are equal , @xmath51 becomes linear in @xmath61 otherwise the contribution of each term @xmath62 would have been of order @xmath63 since rational maps are conformal maps they preserved the relation @xmath64 in which case only terms in the energy density which are at most linear  in @xmath65 survive and presumably this would correspond to an energically favoured configuration .",
    "so one might conjecture that the soliton solutions for the class of models defined in @xcite are well represented by the rational map ansatz or that rational map solutions would remain well suited approximation for extended models as long as they belong to this particular class of models .",
    "this is the main motivation to compare rational maps inspired solutions with the exact numerical solutions for such models .    to briefly review the rational maps ansatz ,",
    "let us introduce the coordinates @xmath66 parametrizing a point @xmath67 in @xmath20 , where @xmath68 is the distance from the origin , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 , its complex conjugate , encode the angular dependance .",
    "following houghton , manton and sutcliffe @xcite , we approximate the structure of skyrmions by a real chiral angle @xmath50 , satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and an ansatz @xmath73 based on rational maps @xmath74 written in terms of polynomials @xmath75 and @xmath76 having no common factors .",
    "the degree @xmath77 $ ] of the map corresponds to the baryonic number @xmath78 of the soliton .",

    "the minimization of the energy ( [ eq : es_maps ] ) requires that we first find the rational map that minimizes ( [ eq : int_i ] ) for a given degree @xmath87 and then find the chiral angle @xmath50 by minimizing the energy in ( [ eq : es_maps ] ) . for the skyrme model ,",
    "the rational maps approximation gives an energy accurate within @xmath88 or @xmath89 compared with exact numerical results , except for the @xmath1 radially symmetric skyrmion where the ansatz yields the exact result .",
    "to study extensions of the skyrme model in topological sectors @xmath5 with the rational maps ansatz , we need to modify the expression for the energy density ( [ eq : densite_e ] ) @xmath90   , \\ ] ] with @xmath33 and @xmath34 now given by the more general expressions @xmath91 where the angular dependence is no longer trivial .",
    "note that the angular distribution of the energy density is entirely included in @xmath92 , and powers of @xmath60 can take into account the angular distribution of any given rational maps ansatz . working with the notation @xmath93 , the static energy of the skyrmion is then written @xmath94 .",
    "\\label{eq : mass_chi}%\\ ] ] the integrals over the angular degrees of freedom present in ( [ eq : mass_chi ] ) are not trivial in general .",
    "the angular dependence is however easy to isolate when @xmath95 is a polynomial , in which case we need to evaluate @xmath96 all the angular dependence for a given choice of rational map is then contained in the integrals ( [ eq : inm ] ) , leading to the following expression for the static energy ( or the mass ) of the skyrmion @xmath97 where @xmath98 since we want to compare general solutions with those of the skyrme model , we use as a starting point the rational maps that minimize the energy for the skyrme model .",

    "as a guiding principle in our choice of models ( or weights @xmath128 ) , we require that the energy density of the models constructed out of linear combinations of @xmath129 be positive . since one of the purposes of this work is to compare exact solutions with the rational maps approximation in order to easily identify the symmetries of the solutions , a second constraint must be imposed on the models . as illustrated in the last section , the rational maps approximation is calculable only for models with a finite number of @xmath129 where the angular dependence can be integrated out . for calculational purposes , we shall therefore limit the analysis here to the most simple extended models : order - six and order - eight lagragians , i.e. @xmath130 in ( [ eq : l ] ) , although we did briefly explore other higher - order models .",
    "finally , the solutions should be stable against a scale transformation , i.e. there must be a mechanism which prevents the skyrmions from shrinking to zero size .",
    "these three simple requirements prove themselves to be quite restrictive in practice , narrowing substantially the possibilities for the higher weights , in particular @xmath131 in the order - eight lagrangian .",
    "in fact , contrary to what one might suspect , taking positive @xmath128 does not guarantee the existence of a positive energy solution .",
    "proceeding first by trial and error to set the value of @xmath131 , we encountered systematically non positive energy densities in most of our numerical calculations .",
    "indeed it was quite difficult to obtain models with a positive energy density when the @xmath132 series has a polynomial form and its last term is of order eight or more in derivatives of the pion fields .",
    "so , we have to take a closer look at the positivity constraint .",
    "jackson , weiss and wirzba @xcite first established a set of rules for extended models . for positivity",
    ", they must obey @xmath133 which are sufficient but not necessary conditions for positivity and may be accompagnied by other conditions such as chiral symmetry restauration @xcite to construct viable models .",
    "these constraints however only apply in the context of the @xmath1 spherically symmetric hedgehog solution .",
    "this is clearly not appropriate for our numerical analysis where no specific ansatz or symmetries are imposed .",
    "let us recall the most general form of the energy density for a model defined by a function @xmath134 @xmath135 note that both the hedgehog and rational maps ansatz assume uniform angular energy distribution which means that in these cases , two of the invariants are equal . without loss of generality , we take @xmath136 @xmath51 in ( [ eabc ] ) is positive if@xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "but if ( [ pos1 ] ) is true , then@xmath140 or@xmath141 the last condition is obeyed if @xmath142 is a positive and concave function over an interval which includes @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "there are other instances where the condition is satified , e.g. if @xmath143 is a negative and convex function over the interval including @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath144 and @xmath145 may not have the same sign in general , and for arbitrary @xmath146 checking positivity analytically is not possible . here , since the first term in @xmath95 corresponds to the nonlinear @xmath10 term , @xmath147 is taken to be positive and at least for small values of @xmath148 @xmath95 is positive and @xmath142 must be concave .",
    "so we shall explore models where @xmath142 remains positive and concave .",
    "it is trivial to show that all order - six models with positive weights @xmath149 and @xmath150 obey this positivity constraint .",
    "our numerical analysis was indeed free of problems related to energy positivity .",
    "as mentioned before , the problem of energy positivity began to arise when we added a term of order eight .",
    "it was nonetheless possible to construct a model that satisfies the constraint .",
    "an appropriate value for @xmath131 was first set by trial and error , checking numerically that the energy density was positive everywhere .",

    "using the concavity constraint on @xmath142 , it is now easy to see that @xmath131 must be negative in an order - eight model . however in principle , the highest order term is responsible for the stability against a scale transformation , and a negative @xmath131 in this model would allow the soliton to shrink to zero size unless another mechanism brings stability .",
    "it turns out that our numerical approach provides such a mechanism naturally .",
    "the solutions are found by discretizing space and by construction the soliton size can not be smaller than the lattice spacing while having a finite baryon number .",
    "so what we are looking for is a finite size solution that minimizes energy .",
    "the solutions may not be a global minimum in energy for the order - eight model but they could be very close to solutions of more physically relevant models .",
    "for example , the eight - order model may be seen as an approximation of the model having the rational form defined by@xmath155 or the lagrangian@xmath156 which in turns has positive energy solutions that are stable against scale transformations .",
    "unfortunately , the solutions for such a model can not be compared directly with rational maps solutions and this is why we only considered finite polynomial form for @xmath134 in the first place . for comparison",
    ", the solutions for the model @xmath157 will also be presented .",
    "despite the numerous attractive features that characterize topological nuclear theories like the skyrme model , it is not an easy task to extract their solutions . this drawback is partly due to the nonlinear structure of such models .",
    "therefore , one must rely on numerical methods to accomplish the minimization of energy functionals in these cases .    in the following section ,",
    "we first describe how sa works by presenting its structure and its most important features in a problem independent way .",
    "then , we review our implementation of the sa algorithm , inspired by the guidelines stated in @xcite , for two different strategies we have used to solve the skyrme model and some of its generalizations . in the one dimensional case , the angular dependence of the energy functional is integrated out with an appropriate rational maps ansatz , then the sa algorithm is used to find the chiral angle function @xmath50 leading to the minimal value for the static energy of the skyrmion .",
    "this is by no mean the most straightforward numerical technique to get the exact solution nor is it the most commonly used or the fastest but it will provide here an estimate of the kind of accuracy the sa algorithm can achieve .",

    "the sa algorithm is an optimization tool that proves to be usefull in several problems . in the case of a classical field theory ,",

    "conversely , working with the sa algorithm does not require to write and solve differential equations which makes it particularly useful if these turn out too complex .",
    "the field configuration @xmath158 is the result of a monte - carlo process , an iterative improvement technique .    in its simplest form ,",
    "the iterative process starts with a given system in a known configuration with respect to a cost function like ( [ eq : general_functional ] ) .",
    "each step of the process corresponds to a random rearrangement operation applied to some parts of the system .",
    "if the rearrangement of the configuration leads to a lower value of the cost function , it is accepted and the next iterative step starts with this new configuration . on the other hand , if the rearranged configuration makes the value of the cost function rise , it is rejected and we put the system back in its former configuration .",
    "iterations are made until no further downhill improvements on the cost function can be found .",
    "this technique is not completely reliable though , because it is frequent to observe searches get stuck in a local minimum of the cost function , rather than the global one we seek .    in 1983 ,",
    "kirkpatrick , gellat and vecchi @xcite introduced the sa algorithm in the framework of iterative processes .",
    "their aim was to improve the convergence towards the global minimum of a cost function . using the analogy between the cost function and a solid that is slowly cooled down , they proposed to add a temperature to the problem .",
    "the idea is simple .",
    "first , heat the system to a certain temperature @xmath163 and run the metropolis algorithm to bring the system into thermal equilibrium .",
    "then , allow the temperature to decrease slowly insuring thermal equilibrium at each step during the cooling process . in the limit of a sufficiently low temperature",
    ", the solid will reach its ground state .",
    "equivalently , one will find the minimal energy configuration @xmath158 of the functional ( [ eq : general_functional ] ) in this limit .",
    "the metropolis algorithm @xcite was originally developped in 1952 to accurately simulate a group of atoms in equilibrium at a given temperature .",
    "the logical scheme of this algorithm is shown in figure [ fig : schema - logique ] . at each step of the iterative process",
    ", a random rearrangement of the configuration is made leading to a modification @xmath164 of the cost function .",
    "if the cost is lowered by this rearrangement @xmath165 , it is accepted and the next iterative step starts with the new configuration .",
    "if the rearrangement increases the cost @xmath166 , it is not automatically rejected . instead",

    "so , it becomes statistically more difficult for a rearranged configuration with @xmath166 to be accepted as the temperature @xmath163 decreases .",
    "this scheme can be applied directly to a cost function like ( [ eq : general_functional ] ) .",
    "let us now state a number of important aspects to keep in mind when implementing an sa algorithm .",
    "( i ) the initial temperature must be chosen with care .",
    "if one starts a simulation with the temperature set too high , the soliton may unwind .",
    "also , the overall running time will be longer because of the increased number of cooling steps then needed .",
    "on the other hand , if the initial temperature is set too low , the system may stabilize in a local minimum when it is sufficiently cooled down .",
    "( ii ) the cooling schedule must be smooth enough .",
    "it has been shown by geman and geman @xcite that if the temperature decreases according to a logarithmic rule , the convergence to the global minimium of the system is guaranteed .",
    "however , faster cooling schemes can produce reliable results too .",
    "( iii ) it is important that the initial guess for the field configuration possesses the winding number of the solution we seek .",
    "if it is not the case , the formation of isolated lumps of baryonic density is likely to occur as the simulation progresses . in our three dimensional simulations",
    ", we initialize the lattice with an appropiate degree rational map .",
    "( iv ) the conservation of the baryonic number must be imposed explicitly in three dimensional simulations .",
    "this is done by adding a lagrange multiplier to the action .",
    "this object tends to reject a trial configuration that compromises the quality of the topological integer , even if this configuration implies a lower value of the cost function . in the one dimensional case , this is not an issue since the conservation of the baryonic number is assured by the boundary conditions on the chiral angle @xmath50 .",
    "the details concerning the sampling method we use and our criterion for the determination of thermal equilibrium will be discussed shortly .      in our one dimensional approach , we first integrate out the angular dependence of the skyrmion using the rational maps ansatz .",
    "then , sa finds the chiral angle @xmath50 leading to a minimal value of the energy functional for generalized skyrme models ( [ eq : mass ] ) . to do this , we need a lattice that represents the radial degree of freedom @xmath170 in a discretized manner . in this context",
    ", the conservation of the topological integer @xmath87 is guaranted by the boundary conditions @xmath71 and @xmath72 and the degree @xmath87 of the rational map @xmath171    to minimize the energy functional of a model , we need to compute @xmath50 on the lattice .",
    "the energy and the baryonic number are evaluated halfway between two adjacent points of the lattice , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",

    "this has the following statistical consequence .",
    "when the algorithm has done a number of random perturbations corresponding to the length of the chain , the value of @xmath50 has been modified approximately 10 times at each point of the lattice . to state that thermal equilibrium",
    "is reached , we compare the lowest energy value encountered in the chain @xmath182 and the sum of the energies obtained at each iteration of the chain @xmath183 to their equivalent in the previous chain . if these two values are higher in the present chain than in the previous , thermal equilibrium has been reached and the temperature may be lowered . in other words ,",

    "every time thermal equilibrium is achieved , the temperature is decreased according to a cooling schedule . in our one dimensional simulations , we use a logarithmic cooling because the computational cost is not an issue .",
    "this kind of schedule decreases the temperature by a fixed ratio at each step , for example @xmath192 , presented on figure [ fig : coolings ] . in practice ,",
    "faster cooling schemes can be used without negative impact on the quality of the global minimum obtained .",
    "experience has shown that such a faster scheme can take the form @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is a constant factor , which still leads to reliable results .",
    "we have set the initial temperature to @xmath193 in all our one dimensional simulations .",
    "this value was obtained by trial and error while comparing the quality of the minimization .    to speed up the minimization process ,",
    "we have even implemented an adaptive lattice .",
    "the simulation is started with a reasonably low number of points and a chiral angle which is a linear interpolation between @xmath71 and @xmath194 .",
    "typically , 100 points are used to cover the lattice that has 150 units of length @xmath195 .",
    "when a global minimum is found , additional lattice points are added where the energy is concentrated and the temperature is set to its initial value @xmath193 before sa starts again .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the desired precision on the solution for @xmath50 is achieved , corresponding to a lattice of approximately 650 points . however , this adaptive procedure is only practical in the one dimensional case , where the computational cost is relatively low . in three dimensional sa ,",
    "computational time and computer memory considerations become important constraints .",
    "so , cooling the system several times to achieve the most convenient lattice spacing would not constitute an advantage in that case .",
    "the three dimensional sa algorithm is used to find exact solitonic solutions .",
    "this approach is a full field simulation where no constraints on the symmetries of the solution are imposed . here",
    "are some important aspects of our three dimensional implementation .",
    "the lattice we use is composed of @xmath196 points equally spaced by @xmath197 units of length @xmath195 .",
    "this lattice spacing is somewhat large , but is a good compromise in regard to reducing the computational time .",
    "the cartesian axes go from @xmath198 units to @xmath199 units in the @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 coordinates .",
    "this finite volume can cause undesirable numerical effects on the edge of the lattice . to significantly reduce these",
    ", we use a lattice with periodic boundaries . in this case",
    "the skyrmion interacts with itself over the boundaries , but its structure is not altered .",
    "the skyrmion only suffers a slight increase in energy .     of the random perturbations done on 3d field vectors as a function of temperature for the skyrme model .",
    "]    because of topology , each lattice point is characterized by a four - component field @xmath28 which satisfies @xmath203 . as a consequence , perturbing the configuration by random rotations must also preserve the length of @xmath28 , as explained in @xcite .",
    "these rotations are parametrized in terms of three random euler angles . for computational purposes ,",
    "we only consider small perturbations for one of the angles by limiting the random values to an upper bound @xmath179 . covering the whole solid angle",
    "is ensured by multiple rotations if needed .",
    "we adjust dynamically the parameter @xmath179 during the cooling process so that @xmath204 of the perturbations performed on the field @xmath28 are rejected . starting with @xmath205 and using a cooling schedule of the form @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is a cooling step , the amplitude @xmath179 drops linearly with temperature ( figure [ fig : a_fct_t_3d ] ) .",
    "this ensures that the rearrangements will not be too large as the temperature decreases , thus respecting the sa scheme .",
    "units @xmath208 .",
    "we identify its vertices with indices for further reference .",
    "the @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 axes are assigned in the directions of the segments @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 respectively . ]    to sample the fields on the lattice , we use again the concept of cell ( figure [ fig : cell_3d ] ) .",
    "an iteration in the statistical chain starts with the random selection of a cell .",
    "then , each of the eight vertices ( lattice points ) of the cell undergoes a rotation of the field .",
    "these rearrangements modify the energy and baryonic densities calculated at the center of the current cell and at the center of the 26 neibourghing cells , each of them having at least one lattice point in common with the randomly modified cell .",
    "we then use the metropolis criterion to analyse the effect of the rotations on the energy of the 27 cells subsystem .",
    "if the acceptance criterion is confirmed , the changes affecting the eight lattice points are all accepted otherwise they are all rejected .    to compute the energy and baryonic densities at the center of a cell",
    ", one must rely on a linear interpolation using the value of the field at each of the eight vertices of the cell .",
    "then , the energy density is evaluated at the center of the cell and the contribution to the total energy is obtained by mutiplying the density by the volume of the cell , @xmath212 .",
    "unfortunately , the linear interpolation does not preserve the relation @xmath203 , so we have to scale the fields following the interpolations .",
    "for example , the derivative at the center of a cell in the @xmath200 direction , refering to figure [ fig : cell_3d ] , is given by @xmath213\\right )   -\\text{scaled}\\left (   \\frac{1}{4}~[\\phi ( a)+\\phi(b)+\\phi(e)+\\phi(f)]\\right )   \\right\\ }   ~.\\nonumber\\ ] ]    in our 3d simulations , we need to introduce a procedure to ensure that the baryonic number of the field configuration is conserved throughout the cooling process .",
    "a convenient way is to add a lagrange multiplier to the action .",
    "this piece filters only appropriate random perturbations generated by the metropolis algorithm . the lagrange multiplier will tend to reject rearrangements compromising the quality of the calculated topological integer , regardless of their effect on the value of the energy functional being minimized . to help the convergence of sa towards the global minimium of the desired topological sector , we initialize the lattice with a field configuration that is already in the sector of interest .",
    "we use a rational map ansatz of adequate degree to generate an initial field configuration .",
    "in fact , the precise form of the initialization ansatz does not matter , as long as its degree @xmath81 . for simplicity ,",
    "we use the ansatz @xmath214 .",
    "such a configuration possesses radial symmetry for @xmath215 and toroidal symmetry for @xmath216 .",
    "first , let us take a look at our results for the static energies and baryonic numbers presented in table [ sk_vs_o6_o8 ] . for the models considered in this work , we note that adding a positive ( negative ) weight @xmath128 leads to an increase ( decrease ) in the static energy of the skyrmion which depends on the size of @xmath128 .",
    "for example , considering that @xmath131 is small compared to @xmath150 , such a feature could explain the slight difference between the energies of the order - six and the order - eight models . also , comparing the ratios @xmath217 , multi - skyrmions solutions of extended models appear to be more stable than for the skyrme model , for a greater part of their energy is used to create solitonic bound states .",
    "however , we can not at this point confirm that these patterns are generic features and that they will hold for other extensions .",
    "again , we recall that the results of the order - eight model should be taken with care , since the solutions are not global minima . the global minima which would lead to negative energy and a zero - size soliton is prevented by a finite lattice spacing .",
    "but the order - eight model and its solutions should be considered here as good approximations for more elaborate models such as ( [ allorder ] ) as can be seen from table [ sk_vs_o6_o8 ] .",
