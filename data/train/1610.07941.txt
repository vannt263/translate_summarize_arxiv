    "the concept of distance has emerged , both in physics and mathematics , as a measure of how apart two objects are .",
    "depending on the context , a distance may refer to a physical length or to a metric function which gives place to the metric spaces theory @xcite . in physics",
    ", it is well known that the information about a system is contained in the state whose evolution gives account of the features of dynamics . in this sense , when there is a limitation or uncertainty about knowledge of the system ( classical or quantum ) , it is common to consider the states as represented by probability distributions functions so a distance between states becomes a measure of distinguishability between two given distributions @xcite .",
    "moreover , one of them would correspond to a true distribution of data observations while the other would typically be a distribution predicted by theory .",
    "many statistical distances of this kind have been defined and for several purposes @xcite , like wooters distance @xcite in quantum mechanics or the metric distance given by the fisher  rao tensor in information geometry @xcite .    in the context of discrete maps , one of the most important statistical features of underlying dynamics",
    "is given by the probability distribution that is invariant under the map when the number of iterations tends to infinite .",
    "this is the so called invariant density of a map which is the probability density of the phase space points after a large number of iterations @xcite @xcite .",
    "the role of invariant densities is crucial in dynamical systems due to ergodic theory is the study of the measures that are invariant under these densities @xcite .    in order to characterize its chaotic regime in the case of the logistic map @xcite , a statistical distance was proposed in @xcite in terms of the invariant density . in this paper",
    "we explore , numerically and theoretically , this idea by redefining the distance of @xcite as a metric to several values of the parameter @xmath1 corresponding to different regimes of the dynamics .",
    "moreover , we define a space metric associated to each value of @xmath1 that gives into account the topology of the phase space points among the dynamics .",
    "therefore , our main contribution is a characterization of discrete maps dynamics using a metric and by associating a metric space , composed by all the distinguishable points of phase space , to the different regimes of the dynamics .",
    "the present work is organized as follows .",
    "first , given a discrete map we introduce the distance in terms of the invariant density made in @xcite , and using equivalence classes we redefine it as a metric . then we propose a space metric , induced by this metric , composed by all the space phase points that can be distinguished in the limit of large iterations of the map .",
    "third , we illustrates the results for the logistic map and for several values of its parameter  @xmath1 .",
    "next , we propose a generalization for maps of more dimensions and apply it to the case of two uncoupled logistic maps . finally , we draw some conclusions , and future research directions are outlined .",
    "we give the general notions about probability distributions , discrete maps and metric spaces used throughout the paper .      in statistical physics a probability distribution defined over a space",

    "discrete map_. from the physical viewpoint , a discrete map that models a system defines its dynamics by iterating eq . where each iteration corresponds to a time step .",
    "that is , if the system is initially in a state @xmath14 then @xmath15 represents the state after @xmath16 time steps .",
    "the importance of discrete maps lies in the fact that they serve as simple but useful models in biology , physics , economics , etc @xcite .",

    "in general , except for some special cases , the invariant density has no analytical expression , and therefore one has to compute it numerically .",
    "invariant densities in physical systems correspond to stationary probability distributions , which allows one to study the system at equilibrium .",
    "we consider a set @xmath2 and a non negative function @xmath23 satisfying the following axioms :    * distinguishability : @xmath24 @xmath25 * symmetry : @xmath26 * triangle inequality : @xmath27    the function @xmath28 is called a _",

    "moreover , using notions of entropy and purification also one can define metrics in quantum state spaces @xcite .",

    "looking at the metric axioms @xmath46 and @xmath32 and using the properties of the integral it is straightforward to check that @xmath43 satisfies @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , there exist situations for which the axiom @xmath30 is not fulfilled . for instance , if @xmath47 in almost every point of some interval @xmath48 $ ] then from it follows that @xmath49 even when @xmath50 . strictly speaking",

    "a solution to this problem is to use equivalence classes in @xmath2 instead of points .",

    "in this way , given the pair @xmath71 one has the following ` canonical ' association between discrete maps and metric spaces : @xmath72 in the general case a discrete map is given by a function @xmath73 depending on a continuous parameter @xmath1 which plays the role of controlling the dynamics as @xmath1 varies .",
