    "ism always cause scintillation and scattering effect to the pulse signals of pulsar ( @xcite ) and it may damages some of the observing data . the scattering effect of ism to the pulse profile and the ppa curve",
    "have been studied by many authors ( @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) . some of them have put forward a several useful model to interpret the observing phenomena of pulse broadening and ppa curve flattening ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; some of them have studied a model to recover original pulse shape ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and ppa curve of some pulsars from scattering effect ( @xcite ) .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the stokes parameters are disturbed by a scattering effect when the signal travels in the ism , so it is natural to think that the ism scattering can affect the stokes phase portraits of @xmath0-@xmath2 , @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath1 . until now",
    "a very few attempts are made to the study of the stokes phase portraits which hold additional information of the emission geometry of pulsar . through frequent observation and studying , researchers put up a several models such as the radius - to - frequency mapping ( rfm ) model ( @xcite ) and the rotating - vector model ( rvm ) ( @xcite ) which were closely related to the geometry of pulsar emission surface .",
    "but , recently , researchers ( @xcite a , b ) have analyzed the observing data of some pulsars in a stokes phase portraits form and they found that the stokes phase portraits of 24 pulsars have shown that the emission heights inferred from the stokes tomography technic ( @xcite a ) are different from the emission heights derived from the rfm model .",
    "the stokes phase portraits of known low - latitude emission of 24 pulsars they examined revealed that the 60@xmath5 of them may well originated from high altitudes ( @xcite a ) . by considering the importance of studying the stokes phase portraits",
    ", we continued the previous work ( @xcite ) , in which we mainly examined the descattering of the ppa curve . in this paper , we have noted that ism scattering can damage and distort some of the observed stokes phase portraits ; for some pulsars , without recovering the data from ism scattering effect would mislead our analysis ( see section 3 ) .",
    "we have recovered pulse intensity and ppa curve shape in previous work ( @xcite ) by adding simple tricks to the model of @xcite . in this paper , we will study the ism scattering effect to the stokes phase portraits of @xmath0-@xmath2 , @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath1 and will provide the descattering of stokes phase portraits of four pulsars .",
    "the method is simply described in section 2 , results of simulation and application are given in section 3 , discussions and conclusions are presented in section 4 and in section 5 respectively .",
    "according to the distribution scale of irregularities of the electron densities in the ism , the scattering models are named thin screen , thick screen and extended screen model .",
    "the formulae of those models and procedure description of descattering are given below ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "@xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is scattering broadening time scale which is determined through pulse profile fitting and also from empirical relation between wavelength ( @xmath10 ) and dispersion measure ( dm ) ( @xcite . by using above scattering model , we can hold descattering to the scattered pulse profiles .",
    "the frequency spectrum of original pulse @xmath11 and observed scattered pulse @xmath12 are related by the equation    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16 is the frequency response of ism , for more details see @xcite .",
    "the descattered restored total intensity pulse profile is @xmath17    the stokes parameters of @xmath2 , @xmath1 are can be derived by assuming @xmath18=@xmath2+@xmath19@xmath1 ; the descattered complex number from the frequency spectrum of observed @xmath18 @xmath20 after applying an inverse fourier transform , we can get @xmath21 from eq.7 and eq.9 one can obtain the descattered stokes parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 . to get the descattered stokes phase portraits there maybe tow ways to do the best fit .",
    "the first one is a fitting the descattered pulse profile to the intrinsic one , higher frequency signals which have negligible scattering effect ; the second one is a iterative method to fit the descattered stokes phase portraits to the intrinsic one .",
    "this paper chosen the first one and has found that the fitting results of scattering time scales of @xcite are useful .",
    "so , all the fitting results of @xmath9 of @xcite are applied in this paper . in plotting , stokes parameter @xmath0",
    "is plotted on the horizontal axis in all figures of stokes phase portraits of @xmath0-@xmath2 and @xmath0-@xmath1 while the @xmath2 and @xmath1 are plotted on the vertical axis . in @xmath2-@xmath1 portraits , @xmath2 is plotted on horizontal axis and @xmath1 is plotted on vertical axis .",
    "all plots from f.g1 to fig.5 are normalized by their own peak value .",
    "the scattering effect and it s descattering for the intensity pulse profiles and ppa curves are simulated in the work of @xcite . we have mainly simulated scattering and descattering for stokes phase portraits of a single pulse profiles of pulsar with each of the three different models . for an illustration of the simulation ,",
    "the thick screen model is applied here .",
    "the simulated pulse profiles have gaussian shape , with ppa(@xmath22 ) curves following the rvm ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper has assumed the rate of linear intensity in total intensity is 0.7 , so that the stokes parameters @xmath23 can be expressed in terms of the linear intensity rate and ppa by @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "then we are able to plot the stokes phase portraits .",
    "the simulated plots are shown in fig.1 ; the plots of ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c)are intensity profiles of original , scattered and descattered pulses ; the four - panel plots under the plots of a , b , c are ppa curves and stokes phase portraits of original , scattered and descattered pulses respectively .",
    "the each sub - panels of the four - panel plot are ppa curves , @xmath2-@xmath1 , @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 phase portraits ( clockwise from top left ) .",
    "the simulation shows that ism scattering causes some sort of changes to the shape of stokes phase portraits .",
    "for instance it causes @xmath2-@xmath1 asymmetry , straitening of @xmath0-@xmath2 ( hockey stick shape becomes stick shape , @xcite a ) and @xmath0-@xmath1 shrunk ( see fig.1 ) . in this simulation we take the scattering time scale 35ms and noticed that some of the stokes phase portraits are not as susceptible as the intensity profiles and ppa curves to the scattering effect .",
    "for example @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "the scattering effect to the stokes phase portraits seems small , comparing with the pulse profiles and ppa curve , but it is worth to be noted .",
    "it can also found from the figures that , in principle , it is possible to eliminate the scattering effect if the scattering screen is clearly formulated .",
    "[ fig1 ]      the data in this paper are downloaded from european pulsar network ( epn ) online database ( @xcite ) . all the observed lower frequency pulse profiles of this four pulsars show obvious pulse profile broadening and ppa curve flattening ( see fig.2-fi.g.5 , top left ) . a descattering compensation of the intensity pulse profile and ppa curve of the lower - frequency pulses of those pulsars are completed by @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this section is to present the descattered stokes phase portraits and its analysis .",
    "observations showed that ism scattering have no much effect to the high frequency signals than to the lower - frequency one .",
    "so the higher frequency pulses s stokes phase portraits are chosen as an intrinsic stokes phase portrait ( it has no obvious scattering effect in itself ) for comparison with the descattered stokes phase portraits .",
    "the scattering time scales of those four pulsars was achieved through fitting the pulse profile in the work of @xcite . in this paper , we reviewed previous method and derived the same results for descattering stokes phase portraits ; for brief reference , here we retabulate few of the @xmath9 and relative data of four pulsars ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this paper has tested all @xmath9 of the three models for obtaining the good descattered stokes phase portraits . for the convenience of further analysis of the descattered phase portraits , the intensity profiles and ppa curves",
    "are given along with stokes phase portraits in all figures ( adopted from @xcite ) .",
    "from fig.2 to fig.5 , the top left four - panel plots are intensity profiles of observed scattered ( total intensity profile in ( a ) and linear intensity profile in ( b ) ) , descattered ( total intensity profile with thick line in ( c ) and linear intensity profile with thick line in ( d ) ) , and intrinsic signals ( total intensity profile with dotted line in ( c ) and linear intensity profile with dotted line in ( d ) ) respectively ( see fig.2 ) ; the observed scattered stokes phase portraits are placed on the top right panel , the bottom left panel is descattered stokes phase portraits , the bottom right panel is intrinsic stokes phase portraits .",
    "the sub - four - panels of the latter three panels are ppa curves , @xmath2-@xmath1 , @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath0-@xmath2 phase portraits ( clockwise from top left ) .",
    "because , it is hardly possible to construct complete look - up table of stokes phase portraits by the formula of rvm , so we used the simulated stokes phase portraits of look - up tables of @xcite ( a ) for analyzing the descattered results .",
    "the stokes parameters of @xcite ( a ) are generated on the base of similar assumption of rvm .",
    "they had provided us a large set of stokes phase portraits with different emission models at different emission height , @xmath26 and @xmath19 ( @xmath27 ) ; here @xmath26 is inclination angle between rotational axis and magnetic axis , @xmath19 observers inclination angel between rotational axis and line of sight , @xmath28 is the impact parameter ( @xcite ) .",
    "after descattering , we have tried to check similar phase portraits from the simulated look - up tables ( @xcite a ) to confirm and analyze descattering phase portraits .",

    ", we demonstrated the main effect of ism scattering to the stokes phase portraits as an asymmetric shape of @xmath2-@xmath1 , @xmath0-@xmath1 and a stick shape of @xmath0-@xmath2 .",

    "in section 3.1 , we have held a simulation to show a ism scattering and descattering .",
    "simulation showed the basic features of stokes phase portraits of a single pulse profile , such as symmetric balloon shape of @xmath2-@xmath1 , heart shape of @xmath0-@xmath1 and hockey stick shape of @xmath0-@xmath2 , and showed the main effects of ism scattering to the shape of stokes phase portraits , for example , asymmetric shape of @xmath2-@xmath1 , @xmath0-@xmath1 and stick shape of @xmath0-@xmath2 .",
    "the descattered results of the simulation bring the possibility of recovering the original shape of stokes phase portrait .",
    "the scattering phenomena not only causes pulse profile broadening and ppa curve flattening , but also it causes a distortion to the stokes phase portraits , for example , the clear distorted shape of @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath1 of psr b1356 - 60 , @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 of psr b1831 - 03 , @xmath2-@xmath1 of psr b1859 + 03 and @xmath0-@xmath1 of psr b1946 + 35 .",
    "of course , in general , the irregularity and distortion of phase portraits may be related to the magnetosphere configuration . in section 3.2 , after descattering the scattered data of four pulsars , the phase portraits of @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath1 of psr b1356 - 60 , @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath1 of psr b1831 - 03 , @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath1 of psr b1859 + 03 and @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath1 of psr b1946 + 35 showed a regular shape , symmetric balloon and banana shape , the phase portraits of @xmath0-@xmath2 of psr b1831 - 03 , @xmath0-@xmath2 of psr b1859 + 03 and @xmath0-@xmath2 of psr b1946 - 35 showed symmetric shape , hockey stick and banana shape .",
    "it is noted that the recovered shape of @xmath2-@xmath1 , @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 manifested the features of stokes phase portraits which are simulated in this paper and in @xcite ( a ) .    when analyzing the descattered phase portraits we have used the look - up tables of stokes phase portraits which are provided by @xcite ( a ) .",
    "it is found that , without removing the scattering effect from the simulated and the observed scattering data , we can not find resemblance of the stokes phase portraits from the look - up tables ( @xcite a ) .",
    "this implies that it is necessary to hold descattering compensation to some scattered data .",
    "we also have noted that not only the descattered phase portraits well matched with the simulated data of @xcite ( a ) , but also the ppa curves are matched too . for psr b1859@xmath403 , we used the simulated stokes phase portraits of hollow cone model with @xmath50 ( @xcite a ) ; this indicates that the hollow cone pulse profile is single peaked and it is the same with the single peak pulse profile of psr b1859@xmath403 .",
    "the large values of @xmath51 of four pulsars can be associated with their shallow ppa swing curve ; on the other hand , when the beam is cut at its outer edge , the impact angle @xmath51 is large @xcite .",
    "the pulse width of associated stokes phase portraits of @xcite ( a ) are all the same as 10@xmath52 .",
    "the pulse width of the four pulsars in this paper are calculated by @xmath53 ( @xcite ) and we obtained the pulse width as 7@xmath52 , 3@xmath52 , 3@xmath52 , and 3@xmath52 degree respectively .",
    "so , the range of values of @xmath19 and @xmath26 for the four pulsars refereed above are used as a reference for analyzing the descattered stokes phase portraits , they need further study to be confirmed . as @xcite ( a ) said the stokes phase portraits should be analyzed concurrently with the pa swing and pulse profiles in future when interpreting radio pulsar polarization data .",
    "in this paper we have presented a simulation of scattered and descattered stokes phase portraits of a single pulse . and",
    "we have shown the descattering compensation of stokes phase portraits of four pulsars .",
    "we have noticed from the fig.1-fig.5 that ism scattering , in some extent , distorts the stokes phase portraits and we found the descattering method implemented in this paper not only worked well to the scattered intensity profiles and ppa curves ( @xcite ) , but also useful to the stokes phase portraits of the observed scattered pulse signals . descattering the stokes phase portraits allows us to obtain the original shapes of stokes phase portraits of scattered pulse signals .",
    "it is worth to noted that it is necessary to consider the effect of scattering to the observed stokes parameters of lower frequency signals , while more attentions are given to the effect of rotational aberration , current - flow ( @xcite ) and rotation and modulation ( @xcite ) .",
