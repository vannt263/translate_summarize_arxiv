    "in classical big bang models the universe starts at infinite density and infinite temperature with infinite expansion velocity and expansion rate .",
    "no reason can be given why it expands so rapidly , the conditions at the big bang enter the models as unexplained initial conditions .",
    "in the case of an open universe these conditions must even prevail throughout the infinite space which the universe occupied already at the very beginning .",
    "since for matter densities above the planck - density  @xmath0 quantum - gravitational effects become important , the validity of classical big bang models is restricted to densities below @xmath0 and times after the plank time @xmath1 at which this density is reached .",
    "theories describing a quantum - evolution of the universe have been presented by several authors : de witt ( @xcite ) , wheeler ( @xcite ) , hartle & hawking ( @xcite ) and others . in general , singularities can not be avoided in these models either . however , when it is assumed that at very early times there are no particles but only vacuum fields in the universe , then nonsingular solutions also exist , having a similar time evolution as the model considered in this paper ( starobinsky @xcite ) .",
    "a serious problem of former big bang models is the enormously large value of about @xmath2 times the planck - length @xmath3 obtained for the cosmic scale factor at the plank time , spanning a range that is not causally connected but nevertheless must be the source of the fantastically isotropic microwave background radiation observed .",
    "this problem has been overcome by incorporating into the big bang models a phase of inflationary expansion ( guth @xcite , linde @xcite and albrecht & steinhardt @xcite ) , according to which within an extremely short time a causally connected region with the extension of a planck - length is inflated to the much larger domain obtained from the classical friedmann - lematre evolution .",
    "exponential expansion of an inflationary phase can be obtained for a cosmic substrate with positive energy density and negative pressure ( gliner @xcite ) , and can be explained by the presence of a scalar higgs field as assumed in the grand unified theories ( georgi & glashow @xcite ) , other scalar fields , tensor fields or other mechanisms ( see overduin & cooperstock @xcite for a list of references ) .",
    "the existence of a field of this kind is equivalent to the existence of a - dynamical - cosmological constant , and in the early stages of the universe , the value of the latter must be extremely high , @xmath4 , if the above mentioned difficulty should be overcome .",
    "thus , there are strong arguments supporting the existence of a large cosmological constant @xmath5 in the very early universe even in the big bang models , classical or combined quantum / classical , and when speaking about big bang models , it will further be assumed that an inflationary phase due to the presence of a large @xmath5 is included .",
    "when this necessity is accepted , then cosmological models become possible that avoid the singularities of classical big bang models and even avoid the necessity to invoke a theory of quantum gravity or rather precursors of such a theory which does not yet exist .",
    "a singularity - free model was suggested by israelit & rosen ( @xcite ) ( called ir - model in the following ) according to which the ( closed ) universe was set into existence as a tiny bubble in a homogeneous and isotropic quantum state with a pre - material vacuum energy density corresponding to @xmath6 , with matter and/or radiation density @xmath7 and with the diameter of a planck length as an initial condition . in this model",
    "it is assumed that , because it is in the quantum regime , this state can prevail for some time .",
    "at the moment when it traverses the barrier to classical behavior it experiences an accelerated expansion described by the expanding branch of a de sitter solution .",
    "for the later evolution a standard model solution with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is assumed .",
    "the transition from de sitter inflation into this evolution is performed by a phase transition ( kirzhnits @xcite , kirzhnits & linde  @xcite and albrecht & steinhardt @xcite ) , transforming vacuum energy density into ordinary matter as in the inflation scenarios of big bang models . in order to get a smooth connection to a reasonable later evolution ,",
    "this transition must occur at the very early time @xmath11 when the density of the standard model solution is @xmath12 .",
    "this is still far above the density of @xmath13 that prevails in this model at the temperature corresponding to @xmath14 at which guts with simple groups give rise to magnetic monopoles of mass @xmath15 ( t hooft @xcite , polyakov @xcite and zeldovich & novikov @xcite ) .",
    "since inflation is already over at this stage , no possibility exists in this model to dilute the heavy monopoles to such a low concentration that an expansion is possible until the present , and that the detection of magnetic monopoles is most unlikely as expressed by the fact they have not yet been observed .",
    "blome & priester ( @xcite ) proposed a `` big bounce model '' ( called bp - model in the following ) in which the universe is closed , exists for an infinite time and first contracts from an infinite size .",
    "after it has passed through a minimal radius larger than @xmath3 it starts re - expanding . in the contraction",
    "phase the universe is in a primordial state of a quantum vacuum with finite energy density and negative pressure @xmath16 .",
    "the `` big bounce '' at the minimal radius is supposed to trigger a phase transition by which ordinary matter is created , the vacuum energy density is reduced and the transition into a friedmann - lematre evolution is achieved as in the inflation scenarios of big bang models .",
    "the parameters of the model are adjusted in a way such that the above mentioned monopole condition is satisfied .",
    "the ir - model was further developed by starkovich & cooperstock ( @xcite ) and by bayin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the pre - material vacuum energy density of the ir - model is attributed to a scalar @xmath17 field obeying a covariant klein - gordon equation that is extended by an additional coupling term to the gravitational field and a potential of the field .",
    "furthermore , an equation of state of the form @xmath18 for the pressure @xmath16 is assumed , for the entropy density the equation of state @xmath19 is derived , and an adiabatic evolution according to is found to comply with the other equations .",
    "three different epochs in the evolution of the universe are assumed for each of which @xmath20 is treated as a constant : first an inflationary era with very small @xmath20 , second a radiation era with @xmath21 , and third a matter era with @xmath22 .",
    "the starting and end points of the different eras are determined by critical or limiting values of physical quantities like the planck density or the planck temperature , the idea of taking these as limiting values for cosmological models being adopted from markov ( @xcite ) . as in the ir - model the ( closed )",
    "universe starts at the planck density @xmath0 with @xmath23 , and in addition to the ir - model the condition @xmath24 is imposed as initial condition , thus providing a start without singularity .",
    "( the model starts at the minimum radius of a big bounce model and , in principle , could be extended further into the past by coupling it to a contraction phase like in the bp - model . ) in the inflationary phase , due to the small value of @xmath20 the density @xmath25 decreases only very slowly whence @xmath26 increases , and the inflation is ended when @xmath27 reaches the planck temperature  @xmath28 . this way no fine tuning",
    "is needed for the adjustment to the following radiation dominated era , and in addition , no re - heating is needed because , differently from usual inflation models , the universe enters the radiation era with the appropriate temperature .",
    "like big bang models with inflation , the model presented in this paper requires some primordial relativistic matter and/or radiation in addition to a high energy density of some primordial quantum field .",
    "it can even avoid singularities that are still present in the bp - model , i.e. infinite extension of the closed universe and infinite velocity of contraction in the far past , @xmath29 , and it also avoids the problem of missing monopole dilution .",
    "the equations for a homogeneous and isotropic universe to be used are the well known lematre equations @xmath30 @xmath31 ( @xmath32 gravity constant , @xmath33 cosmological constant , @xmath34 speed of light , @xmath35 , @xmath36  cosmic scale factor , density and @xmath37 pressure ) following from einsteins field equations .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath38 when the energy equation @xmath39 is employed .",
    "concerning the cosmological constant , as in the usual scenarios of cosmic inflation it is assumed that it can be explained and assumes a very large value due to the presence of some primordial vacuum field which at early times and very high temperatures was in a ground state of very high energy density .",
    "there are two possible ways to incorporate this assumption into eqs .",
    "( [ 1])([2 ] ) : + 1 .",
    "one can set @xmath8 and replace @xmath40 , where @xmath25 is the mass density of a quantum field corresponding to its energy density , and @xmath41 is the mass density of matter plus radiation . in this case",
    "the equations must be supplemented with the ansatz @xmath42 for a negative pressure of the vacuum ( starobinsky @xcite and zeldovich @xcite ) , and it must be assumed that @xmath43 adds to the pressure @xmath44 of radiation and matter , yielding the total pressure @xmath45 .",
    "equivalently one can set @xmath46 , @xmath47 and replace @xmath5 by @xmath48 .",
    "if in addition the equation of state for relativistic matter and radiation , @xmath49 , is employed , then from ( [ 3 ] ) both representations yield @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constant values of @xmath41 and @xmath53 to be specified later , and from ( [ 1])([2 ] ) both representations yield @xmath54    now the first step is to look for steady state solutions . for these @xmath55",
    "is required , and from @xmath56 and ( [ 6 ] ) the condition @xmath57 is obtained .",
    "it implies that in the static initial state from which the universe is supposed to evolve , there must be an equipartition between the energy of the vacuum and the energy of relativistic matter and/or radiation . using this result , from the second requirement @xmath24 and from ( [ 6 ] )",
    "the conditions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are obtained .",
    "it must , of course , be expected that , like einstein s static universe , this static solution will be unstable .",
    "however , it is just this property which opens the possibility that the present universe has evolved from it through an instability .",
    "the instability of the static solution ( [ 8 ] ) follows from the existence of a dynamic solution that asymptotically converges towards it as @xmath60 . to prove this and to derive the unstable solution it suffices to solve eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) because for @xmath38 eq . (",
    "[ 6 ] ) will then be satisfied automatically . in order to satisfy the condition imposed on the asymptotic behavior , @xmath61 and ( [ 8 ] )",
    "must be inserted in eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "however , it is more convenient to use ( [ 8 ] ) and replace @xmath51 with @xmath62 and from ( [ 5 ] ) one thus obtains @xmath63 or @xmath64 for the equation with the plus sign one easily finds the solution @xmath65 with @xmath66 being an integration constant .",
    "( the solution for the minus sign , obtained from this solution by replacing @xmath67 , has @xmath68 instead of @xmath69 and is of no interest here because it describes a contracting universe . ) for the solution ( [ 11 ] ) the universe has already existed for an infinite time and was separated from the static solution ( [ 8 ] ) through an instability in the infinite past .",
    "first it starts expanding very slowly , the expansion velocity @xmath70 becoming larger and larger with time until the exponential term becomes dominant and the expansion exponentially inflating according to @xmath71 just as after a big bang . during inflation",
    "the matter is getting extremely diluted and , as a consequence of this , cooled down as well .",
    "therefore , in principle it would be necessary to replace ( [ 4]b ) at a certain stage by the equation @xmath72 valid for cold matter .",
    "however , this is not necessary because at this stage the matter density @xmath41 is much smaller than the vacuum density @xmath25 and can thus be neglected .",
    "it must be assumed that through the process of inflation a phase transition is triggered , transforming energy of the vacuum field into energy of matter as in the usual inflation models . from the simplifying assumption",
    "that this transition occurs instantaneously at the scale - factor @xmath73 of a friedmann - lematre solution for regular matter extending until today , and from ( [ 11 ] ) , the condition @xmath74 is obtained , which is satisfied by the choice @xmath75\\ ] ] of the integration constant @xmath66 .

    "all models merge into the same friedmann - lematre evolution.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    since in the phase of inflation , according to ( [ 4 ] ) , radiation and relativistic matter of the joint density @xmath41 are becoming extremely diluted , it must be assumed that energy of the vacuum field with density @xmath79 is transformed into energy of regular matter from which the present matter of the universe derives .",
    "therefore , the time @xmath80 must be before the creation of quarks but late enough that no remarkable density of magnetic monopoles was able to develop , which would happen for @xmath81 . with the choice @xmath82 corresponding to @xmath83 , according to ( [ 8 ] ) the intersection of the solution ( [ 11 ] ) with a friedmann - lematre solution @xmath84 ( obtainable from ( [ 12 ] ) ) occurs at the time @xmath85 with @xmath86 , and both conditions are met .",
    "the radius @xmath83 from which the universe started according to the present model is well above the planck length by a factor of @xmath87 .",

    "[ pic:1 ] shows the time evolution of @xmath76 for the present model ( @xmath88 ) , for a big bang model with inflation ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) , for the bp - model ( @xmath89 ) , and finally for the ir - model ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "a question of considerable interest is how and why the phase transition from inflation to ordinary friedmann - lematre expansion is triggered .",
    "a dynamical evolution , for example some instability of the vacuum field , must be supposed , and it must be assumed that it was not present in the infinite time before inflation .",
    "qualitatively it may be expected that , as in the inflation scenarios of big bang models , extreme temperatures before the inflation give rise to thermal fluctuations that change the thermally averaged potential of a quantum field in such a way that it has a large positive minimum value .",
    "the phase transition can then be attributed to a decrease of this minimum caused by the rapid cooling through inflationary expansion .    during the phase transition",
    ", the extremely low values of density and temperature to which the primordial matter and/or radiation have been brought down through inflation must be restored to the high values that are required as initial values for the friedmann - lematre evolution finally leading to the present state of the universe . for this process",
    "several possibilities exist : + 1 .",
    "the primordial matter remains as cold and diluted as it came out of the preceding inflation phase and is cooled down and diluted still further during the following friedmann - lematre evolution . in this case",
    "the vacuum energy density @xmath25 must be completely converted into the density of hot matter and radiation , and matter of a kind completely different from the primordial matter that existed for @xmath60 could be created . as a consequence ,",
    "in addition to the matter that developed during and after the phase transition there could be a second component of quite different matter , although diluted and cooled down extremely .",
    "+ 2 . the vacuum energy could be completely used up for re - heating the primordial matter , at the same time increasing its density due to the mass contained in its thermal energy .",
    "the third possibility consists in a combination of re - heating of old matter and creation of new matter from vacuum energy .",
    "+ in this paper , no preference to any of these possibilities is given because the friedmann - lematre evolution following the phase transition is the same for all of them .",
    "+ in the following differences between the present model and big bang models are searched . before the phase transition",
    "the present model provides much more time than big bang models , and also the ratio @xmath92 is quite different , because in the big bang model the density @xmath41 has already dropped to @xmath93 when it has reached the scale factor @xmath52 , while in the present model @xmath94 at this stage .",
    "therefore , the stability behavior with respect to perturbations that locally destroy the high symmetry of the cosmological principle may be quite different .",
    "however , it must be expected that differences arising this way are washed out by the exponential inflation .",
    "furthermore , in the process of phase transition , in spite of quite different values of @xmath41 , no differences can be expected to arise , because in both models @xmath41 is extremely diluted so that it can be neglected in comparison with @xmath25 which is the same in both models .",
    "after the period of inflation , both models merge into a friedmann - lematre evolution first described by the lematre equation @xmath95 and later until today by the friedmann equation @xmath96 a complete discussion of all possible solutions is given in a survey paper by felten & isaacman ( @xcite ) .    since during the phase transition",
    "most of the vacuum energy is used up for re - heating and/or creation of matter , after it @xmath5 must be either zero or have an extremely small value in comparison with its value before the phase transition . in order to obtain a solution that complies with the matter density presently observed in the universe , @xmath5 must be different from zero .",
    "as long as @xmath53 is sufficiently small , the @xmath5- and the @xmath97-term on the right hand side of ( [ 12 ] ) can be neglected and the evolution of the present model and big bang models is essentially identical .",
    "thus the possible appearance of differences is restricted to later times . from the friedmann equation , for the quantities",
    "@xmath98 with @xmath99 the condition @xmath100 with @xmath101 hubble parameter can be derived and becomes @xmath102 for the present model ( @xmath103 ) or the standard model ( @xmath35 and @xmath104 ) respectively .",

    "the coexistence of a quantum field of energy density @xmath79 with some sort of primordial relativistic matter and/or radiation is an essential ingredient of the present model that may be critically considered and certainly needs discussion .",
    "the fact that a similar coexistence is assumed in big bang models with inflation may be invoked in support , but it may be a weak argument in view of opposing arguments raised by other authors .",
    "priester et al .",
    "( @xcite ) emphasize that a quantum vacuum state of the universe is the more natural choice for its primordial stage than a state in which elementary particles already have been present .",
    "usually the origin of the vacuum energy density is assumed to be either the higgs field that was introduced in elementary particle physics in order to explain the mass of elementary particles through interactions , or some other quantum field or other causes like worm - holes etc .",
    "the question is whether a primordial quantum field can exist on its own as a precondition for massive particles to be formed later , or whether it in turn needs these particles for its own existence .",
    "when the venerable principle _ actio = reactio _ is invoked , the second view appears as the more natural one .",
    "if this is accepted , then still another feature of the model becomes plausible . at first glance",
    "an extreme fine tuning appears to be needed in order that the condition @xmath94 is getting satisfied .",
    "however , in an equilibrium state equipartition between two interacting ingredients is the only natural constellation , and in this spirit the fact , that equipartition in the equilibrium state results from the the field equations , may even appear as a confirmation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the condition for the existence of an unstable equilibrium state from which the universe evolves through instability is quite contrary for the classical equilibrium of the present model and the quantum equilibrium considered by starobinsky ( @xcite ) : in the classical case in addition to the higgs field the presence of particles is necessary while in the quantum case just the absence of particles is required .    in this paper , in agreement with its modern interpretation as the energy density of some quantum field , the cosmological constant is treated as a dynamical variable rather than a geometrical one .",
    "however , this treatment is rather crude because @xmath5 is still kept constant for most of the time  at a very large value during early stages of the universe and at its present low value after the phase transition until today .",
    "many models have been proposed coupling the decay of @xmath25 to the time evolution of the universe or its scale factor @xmath53 - a survey is presented in a paper by overduin & cooperstock ( @xcite ) - , and it should be possible to replace the instant transition assumed in this paper with one of these more refined transitions without major changes in the results .",

    "[ sec : vacen ] for one specific model .",
    "a look at the evolution of @xmath231 used for the calculations of this paper ( fig .",
    "[ pic:4 ] ) shows that the present model could contribute to a solution of the `` coincidence problem '' .",
    "this is raised by the latest observations according to which @xmath25 lies in the same range as the matter density @xmath41 today ( see zlatev et al .",
    "the coincidence problem consists in the fact that , according to many models , @xmath41 and @xmath25 start at very different values in the early universe and require an extreme fine tuning at that time in order to reach almost equal values at present . in the soft bang model of this paper",
    "the universe starts with @xmath94 , during the evolution of the universe there are times at which the two densities temporarily depart from each other , but today they are very close to each other again .",
    "it appears that the present model would provide a good starting point for developing a quintessence field with `` tracking properties '' ( see zlatev et al .",
    "@xcite )  at least it appears to be in good agreement with the requirements of such a concept .",
    "conceptually it has been considered as a very satisfying property of big bang models that in them the universe does not have an eternal past but originated from some act of creation . in this sense",
    "the eternal past of the present model may appear as a conceptual disadvantage . however , the situation is not as bad as it appears . in physics time",
    "is a parameter that is used for ordering changes of states .",
    "however , when there are no changes then this order parameter loses its sense . in a very slowly changing situation",
    "it may therefore become more useful to consider the changes themselves as the order parameter that represents time instead of using an order parameter ordering no changes . in this sense",
    "the lifetime of the universe considered in this paper is not greater than that of big bang models because there has been even a smaller change from the original state to the present ."
