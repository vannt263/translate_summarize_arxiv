    "the knowledge of the radiative corrections to the mass of the lightest higgs boson is important for the following reasons : given either a lower experimental bound on its mass , or a future measurement of its mass , they allow either to decide whether a particular supersymmetric extension of the standard model is ruled out , or to put constraints on additional parameters of the model ( as the squark masses or @xmath5 ) on which the radiative corrections depend .",

    "now , the upper bound on the mass @xmath7 of the lightest cp even higgs is m_h^2 m_z^2 ( ^2 2 + ^2 2 ) [ tree ] which depends on the new yukawa coupling @xmath0 ( unless @xmath8 is very small , i.e. @xmath5 large ) .",

    "these radiative corrections in the nmssm have not been computed to the same accuracy as in the mssm . of course , radiative corrections in the nmssm that are proportional to the quark / lepton yukawa couplings and the gauge couplings only are the same as in the mssm , but there are many additional contributions involving the new yukawa couplings @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the superpotential in eq .",
