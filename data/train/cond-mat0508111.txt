    "semiconductor quantum dots @xcite ( qds ) are nanometer sized regions of space where free carriers are confined by electrostatic fields .",
    "typically , the confining field may be provided by compositional design ( e.g. , the qd is formed by a small gap material embedded in a larger - gap matrix ) or by gating an underlying two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas .",
    "different techniques lead to nanometer size qds with different shapes and strengths of the confinement . as the typical de broglie wavelength in semiconductors is of the order of 10 nm , nanometer confinement leads to a discrete energy spectrum , with energy splittings ranging from fractions to several tens of mev .",
    "the similarity between semiconductor qds and natural atoms , ensuing from the discreteness of the energy spectrum , is often pointed out .",
    "@xcite shell structure @xcite and correlation effects @xcite are among the most striking experimental demonstrations .",
    "more recently , the interest in new classes of devices has fuelled investigations of qds which are coupled by quantum tunneling .",
    "@xcite in addition to their potential for promising applications , these systems extend the analogy between natural and artificial atoms to the molecular realm ( for a review of both theoretical and experimental work see ref .  ) .",
    "maybe the most prominent feature of _ artificial _ atoms is the possibility of a fine control of a variety of parameters in the laboratory .",
    "the nature of ground and excited few - electron states has been shown to vary with artificially tunable quantities such as confinement potential , density , magnetic field , inter - dot coupling .",
    "@xcite such flexibility allows for envisioning a vast range of applications in optoelectronics ( single - electron transistors , @xcite lasers , @xcite micro - heaters and micro - refrigerators based on thermoelectric effects @xcite ) , life sciences,@xcite as well as in several quantum information processing schemes in the solid - state environment .",
    "@xcite    almost all qd - based applications rely on ( or are influenced by ) electronic correlation effects , which are prominent in these systems .",
    "the dominance of interaction in artificial atoms and molecules is evident from the multitude of strongly correlated few - electron states measured or predicted under different regimes : fermi liquid , wigner molecule ( the precursor of wigner crystal in 2d bulk ) , charge and spin density wave , incompressible state reminescent of fractional quantum hall effect in 2d ( for reviews see refs .  ) .",
    "it is important to understand where the dominant correlation effects arise from . in qds",
    "the `` external '' confinement potential originates either from band mismatch or from the self - consistent field ( scf ) due to doping charges . in both cases ,",
    "the total field modulation which confines a few free carriers is smooth and can often be approximated by a parabolic potential in two dimensions .",
    "therefore , the single - particle ( sp ) energy gaps of the free carrier states are uniform in a broad energy range .",
    "this is in contrast with natural atoms , where the electron confinement is provided by the singular nuclear potential .",
    "furthermore , while the kinetic energy term scales as @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the dimensionless parameter measuring the average distance between electrons , the coulomb energy scales as @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to natural atoms , in semiconductor qds the coulomb - to - kinetic - energy ratio can be rather large ( even larger than one order of magnitude ) , the smaller the carrier density the larger the ratio .",
    "this causes coulomb correlation to severely mix many different sp configurations , or slater determinants ( sds ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that any successful robust computational strategy in qds , if flexible enough to address different correlation regimes , must not rely on truncation of the fock space of sds obtained by filling a given sp basis with @xmath3 electrons .    the theoretical understanding of qd electronic states in a vaste class of devices is based on the envelope function and effective mass model.@xcite here , changes in the bloch states , the eigenfunctions of the bulk semiconductor , brought about by `` external '' potentials other than the perfect crystal potential , are taken into account by a slowly varying ( envelope ) function which multiplies the fast oscillating periodic part of the bloch states .",
    "this decoupling of fast and slow fourier components of the wave function is valid provided the modulation of the external potential is slow on the scale of the lattice constant .",
    "then , the theory allows for calculating such envelope functions from an `` effective '' schrdinger equation where only the external potentials appear , while the unperturbed crystalline potential enters as a renormalized electron mass , i.e.  the `` effective '' value @xmath4 replaces the free electron mass .",
    "therefore , sp states can be calculated in a straightforward way once compositional and geometrical parameters are known .",
    "this approach was proved to be remarkably accurate by spectroscopy experiments for weakly confined qds ; @xcite for strongly confined systems , such as certain classes of self - assembled qds , atomistic methods might be necessary.@xcite    several different theoretical approaches have been employed in the solution of the few - electron , fully interacting effective - mass hamiltonian of the qd system @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6^{2}\\,+\\,v(\\boldsymbol{r } ) .",
    "\\label{eq : hsp}\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 is the number of free conduction band electrons ( or free valence band holes ) localized in the device `` active '' area , @xmath7 , @xmath4 , and @xmath8 are respectively the carrier charge , effective mass , and static relative dielectric constant of the host semiconductor , @xmath9 is the position of the electron , @xmath10 is its canonically conjugated momentum , @xmath11 is the vector potential associated with an external magnetic field .",
    "the effective potential @xmath12 describes the carrier confinement due to the electrostatic interaction with the environment .",
    "we ignore the ( usually small ) zeeman term coupling spin with magnetic field ; this small perturbation can always be added _ a posteriori_.    the eigenvalue problem associated to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hi ] ) has been tackled mainly via hartree - fock ( hf ) method , density functional theory , configuration interaction ( ci ) , and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) ( for reviews see refs .  ) .",
    "each method has its own merits and drawbacks ; mean - field methods , for example , are simple and may treat a large number of carriers , a common situation in many experimental situations .",
    "on the other hand , ci and qmc methods allow for the treatment of coulomb correlation with arbitrary numerical precision , and , therefore , represent the natural choice for studies interested in strongly correlated ( low density or high magnetic field ) regimes which are nowadays attainable in very high quality samples .",
    "in addition , ci is a straightforward approach with respect to qmc , and gives access to both ground and lowest excited states at the same time and with comparable accuracy , which allows for the calculation of various response functions to be directly compared with experiments .",
    "the main limitations within the ci approach , when applied to the strongly correlated regimes attainable in artificial atoms , are that truncation of the fock space  one of the standard procedures in traditional ci methods of quantum chemistry ( the so - called _ ci with singles , doubles _ , etc.@xcite )  generally gives large errors or even qualitatively wrong results , and that the fock space dimension grows exponentially with @xmath3 .",
    "here we present a newly developed ci code @xcite with performances comparable to qmc calculations for a broad range of electron densities , covering the transition from liquid to solid electron phases .",
    "the implementation is independent of the sp orbital basis and , therefore , of the details of the device .",
    "we do not assume any truncation of the fock space of sds generated from the chosen sp basis [ _ full - ci _",
    "@xcite ( fci ) ] .",
    "the large eigenvalue problem is reduced to its minimal size by exploiting the symmetry of the effective - mass interacting hamiltonian ( [ eq : hi ] ) , including square total spin @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xcite the resulting hamiltonian , which represents the coulomb interaction in the many - electron basis , is diagonalized via a parallel version of the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the motivation for developing a new code , instead of using ci codes already available in the computational quantum chemistry literature , was the difficulty of handling such codes , optimized for traditional _ ab initio _ applications , to treat effective or model problems such as a few electrons in artificial atoms .",
    "therefore , our code has been developed entirely from scratch and specifically designed for quantum dot applications .",
    "one peculiar feature is that it builds the whole hamiltonian in the many - electron basis and it stores it in computer memory ( see sec .",
    "[ s : code ] ) .",
    "this procedure presently constitutes a limitation with respect to state - of - the - art ci algorithms @xcite of quantum chemistry based on the _ direct _ technique , which avoids the storage of the hamiltonian ( cf .",
    "[ s : discussion ] ) .",
    "the implementation of the direct ci algorithm is left to future work .    in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our code , we present a benchmark calculation in the strongly correlated regime _",
    "par excellence _ , namely the crossover region between fermi liquid and wigner crystallization , and we compare results with available qmc data .",
    "since the fci code gives access to both wave functions and energies of the first excited states , we analize the signatures of crystallization in the excitation spectrum .",
    "we also discuss the performance of the algorithm in a parallel environment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first the general code structure is illustrated ( sec .",
    "[ s : code ] ) , then possible sp bases and related convergence problems are considered ( sec .",
    "[ s : sp ] ) .",
    "section [ s : performance ] analyzes the code performance in a parallel environment .",
    "a benchmark physical application in demanding correlation regimes is considered in sec .",
    "[ s : physics ] , where results are compared with qmc and ci data taken from literature .",
    "section [ s : yrast ] discusses the peculiar features of the excitation spectrum in the strongly correlated regime .",
    "finally , some general considerations are addressed ( sec .",
    "[ s : discussion ] ) , followed by the concluding section [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "appendix [ a : csf ] reviews the construction of the many - electron hilbert space and related issues , while appendix [ a : coulombmatrix ] provides the explicit expression of the 2d coulomb matrix elements for the so - called fock - darwin sp orbitals .",
    "the interacting hamiltonian ( [ eq : hi ] ) can be written in second quantized form @xcite on the basis of a complete and orthonormal set of sp orbitals @xmath14 : @xmath15 here @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron in the spin - orbital @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the spinor eigenvector of the spin @xmath20-component with eigenvalue @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , the label @xmath23 stands for a certain set of orbital quantum numbers , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the one- and two - body matrix elements , respectively , of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hi ] ) .",
    "the latter are defined as follows :    [ eq : paramdef ] @xmath26    the adopted fci strategy to find the ground- and excited - state energies and wave functions of @xmath3 interacting electrons , described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hi ] ) or ( [ eq : hii ] ) , proceeds in three separate steps :    * a specific set of @xmath27 single - particle orbitals , @xmath14 , is chosen .",
    "@xmath27 should be large enough to guarantee as much completeness of the sp space as possible .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath28 for a given device [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : paramdef ] ) ] are computed numerically only once , and then stored on disk . in case @xmath29",
    "is an eigenfunction of the sp hamiltonian ( [ eq : hsp ] ) the matrix @xmath24 acquires a diagonal form , @xmath30 . in a few ( but important ) cases , the sp orbitals are eigenfunctions of a particularly simple sp hamiltonian @xmath31 , and analytic expressions for @xmath24 and @xmath28 can be derived ; one example is discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : fd ] . * the many - electron hilbert ( fock ) space is built up .",
    "the @xmath3-electron wave function , @xmath32 , is expanded as a linear combination of configurational state functions @xcite ( csfs ) , @xmath33 , namely primitive combinations of sds which are simultaneously eigenvectors of the spatial symmetry group of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hi ] ) , the square total spin @xmath34 , and the projection of the spin along the @xmath20-axis @xmath35 : @xmath36 on such a basis set , the matrix representation of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hii ] ) acquires a block diagonal form , where each block is identified by a different irreducible representation of the spatial and spin symmetry group ( the latter is labeled by @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) . the algorithm for building the whole set of csfs starting from the sp basis set",
    "is described in detail in app .",
    "a ; here we are only concerned with the fact that csfs are linear combination of sds , @xmath37 , obtained by filling in , in all possible ways consistent with symmetry requirements , the @xmath38 spin - orbitals with @xmath3 electrons : @xmath39 the @xmath40 s being the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "these do not depend on the device , and can be calculated once ( see app .",
    "a ) and stored on disk .",
    "* hamiltonian matrix elements in the csf representation are calculated .",
    "since several csfs @xmath33 may consist of different linear combinations of the same sds @xmath37 , it is convenient to compute and store once and for all the non - null matrix elements of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hii ] ) between all possible sds , @xmath41 ; subsequently , the matrix elements between csfs , @xmath42 , can be simply evaluated using the coefficients @xmath40 previously stored : @xmath43 then , the secular equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the identity operator , is solved by means of the lanczos package arpack , @xcite designed to handle the eigenvalue problem of large size sparse matrices .",
    "eventually , eigenenergies @xmath46 and eigenvectors @xmath47 are found and saved , ready for post - processing ( wave function analysis , computation of charge density , pair correlation functions , response functions , etc ) .",
    "step 1 - 3 are implemented in the suite of programs donrodrigo , @xcite named after the characters of alessandro manzoni s literary masterpiece _",
    "i promessi sposi_. each step corresponds to a different high - level routine , providing maximum code flexibility .",
    "specifically , step 1 is an independent program on its own , the innominato code : the idea is that , to describe different qd devices , it is sufficient to modify only the form of the confinement potential , @xmath12 , and field components appearing in the sp hamiltonian ( [ eq : hsp ] ) .",
    "indeed , the confinement potential and the sp basis set only affect parameters @xmath24 and @xmath28 .",
    "such parameters are passed , as input data , to step 2 - 3 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : schema ] ) which constitute the core of the main program , and do not depend on the form of the sp hamiltonian and basis set .",
    "step 2 - 3 are by far the most intensive computational parts and are parallelized via the mpi interface : the hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath41 are distributed among all processors . only non - null elements are allocated in local memory , and the parallel version of arpack routine is used for diagonalization .",
    "matrix element computation is optimized by implementing a binary representation for csfs : each csf corresponds to a couple of 64-bit integers , where each bit represent the occupation of a sp orbital ( app .",
    "a2 ) , and highly efficient bit - per - bit logical operations are used to determine the sign of the matrix element , depending on the anti - commuting behavior of fermionic operators .",
    "an example is given in sec .",

    "( 300,180 ) ( 10,0 )    figure [ fig : schema ] is the graphical synopsis of the interface between codes belonging to the suite donrodrigo , including post - processing routines , which actually consitute a rich collection of codes capable of calculating experimentally accessible quantities and response functions .",
    "presently , we have already implemented wave function analysis , computation of charge density and pair correlation functions , @xcite dynamical form factor , @xcite purely electronic raman excitation spectrum , @xcite single - electron excitation transport spectrum , @xcite spectral density weight ( one - particle green s function ) , @xcite relaxation time of excited states via acoustic phonon emission .",
    "so far , in applications , among all possible sp basis sets @xmath14 we chose the eigenfunctions of the sp hamiltonian @xmath48 . in this section",
    "we review the two most common cases .",
    "two common classes of qd devices are the so - called `` planar '' and `` vertical '' qds .",
    "planar qds are obtained starting from a quantum well semiconductor heterostructure , where conduction electrons are free to move in the plane parallel to the interfaces , therefore realizing a two dimensional electron gas .",
    "the second step is to deposit electrodes on top of the structure , which laterally deplete the electron gas forming a puddle of carriers , i.e. , the dot @xcite . by appropriate engineering the top gates , more than one qd",
    "can also be formed , coupled by quantum mechanical tunneling .",
    "vertical qds are included in cylindrical mesa pillars built by laterally etching a quantum well or a heterojunction .",
    "@xcite in this case , devices with two or more tunnel coupled qds can be obtained starting from coupled quantum wells or heterojunctions .    in the above devices ,",
    "the in - plane confinement is much weaker than the confinement in the underlying quantum well or heterojunction .",
    "it is commonly accepted @xcite that the confinement potential for the above devices is accurately described by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the natural frequency of a 2d harmonic trap and @xmath51 describes the profile of a single or multiple quantum well along the growth axis @xmath20 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hsp ] ) , with the potential given by ( [ eq : vsp ] ) and possibly a homogeneous static magnetic field applied parallel to @xmath20 , are of the type @xmath52 namely the motion is decoupled between the @xmath53 plane and the @xmath20 axis . here , the @xmath54 s , known as fock - darwin orbitals @xcite ( see below ) , are eigenfunctions of the in - plane part of the sp hamiltonian with eigenvalues @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 being respectively the radial and azimuthal quantum numbers ( @xmath58 @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 being the magnetic field , and the @xmath63 s ( @xmath64 ) are eigenfunctions of the confinement potential along @xmath20 . at zero field",
    "the fock - darwin energies ( [ eq : eigenfd ] ) display a characteristic shell structure , the orbital degeneracy increasing linearly with the shell number ( fig .",
    "[ f : fdshell ] ) .",
    "( 300,180 ) ( 35,160 )    the explicit expression of fock darwin orbitals is @xmath65 { \\rm e}^{-{\\rm i}m\\vartheta } , \\label{eq : fdexplicit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 are polar coordinates and @xmath67 is a generalized laguerre polynomial .",
    "the typical lateral extension is given by the characteristic dot radius @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the mean square root of @xmath70 on the fock - darwin ground state @xmath71 .",
    "in usual applications only the first one or two confined states along @xmath20 are important , since the localization in the growth direction is much stronger than in the plane , @xcite and it is often possible to assume a mirror symmetry with respect to the plane crossing the origin , @xcite @xmath72 . in the above simple model the spatial symmetry group of the device , @xmath73 , is abelian and therefore sds ( csfs ) transforming according to its irreducible representations",
    "may be straightforwardly built .",
    "@xcite the presence of a vertical magnetic field makes the system chiral and reduces the symmetry to @xmath74 .",
    "the most obvious advantage for choosing as sp basis orbitals the eigenfunctions of the sp hamiltonian itself is that they represent a natural and simple starting point with regards to the physics of the problem , allowing for both fast convergence in sp space and easy symmetrization of many - electron wave functions . besides",
    ", in the two dimensional case coulomb matrix elements are known analytically ( cf .",
    "b ) , while in the three dimensional case [ eq .  ( [ eq : vsp ] ) ] one can limit the effort of a six dimensional integral evalutation to only a three dimensional numerical integration , two variables being along the @xmath20-axis and one along the radial relative coordinate , respectively , after transformation to cylindrical coordinates in the in - plane center - of - mass frame . therefore",
    ", the evalutation of the coulomb integrals ( [ eq : paramdefcoul ] ) is easily feasible  the serial version of the innominato routine contributes a negligible part to the total computation time  and makes the usage of fock - darwin orbitals in the qd context competitive with the implementation , e.g. , of a gaussian basis . @xcite",
    "exploiting spatial symmetry and nearly parabolic confinemente is not always possible .",
    "for example , self - assembled qds grown by the stranski - krastanov mechanism in strained materials , like in several iii - v materials @xcite , grow in highly non symmetric shapes . another case where symmetry is lost is by application of a magnetic field with arbitrary direction .",
    "@xcite in both cases , the no analytic solutions are available . in these unfavorable cases we solve in a completely numerical way",
    "the sp schrdinger equation and obtain coulomb matrix elements via fourier transformation of ( [ eq : paramdefcoul ] ) in the reciprocal space ( for more details see ref .  ) .",
    "note that the coulomb integrals in ( [ eq : paramdefcoul ] ) become complex as far as the field is tilted with respect to the @xmath20 axis . in this general case",
    "the algorithm is computationally demanding already at the sp level , requiring extensive code parallelization .      in order to assess quantitatively both completeness and convergence rates for the fock - darwin sp basis",
    ", we set up a test case , which we will systematically refer to in the remainder of the paper .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath3 electrons in a 2d harmonic trap [ eq .  ( [ eq : vsp ] ) with @xmath75 as the density is progressively reduced , namely the lateral dimension @xmath69 increases as @xmath3 is kept fixed .",
    "this test case is a significant benchmark since : ( i ) path integral qmc calculations are available , @xcite providing `` exact '' data concerning energies and wave functions of the ground state ; ( ii ) as far as @xmath69 increases , the dot goes progressively into a strong correlation regime , which is more and more demanding with respect to the size of the many - electron space needed ; ( iii ) the model is simple and the parameters of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : paramdef ] ) may be computed analytically .",
    "( 300,180 ) ( 10,0 )    we measure the strength of correlation by means of the dimensionless parameter @xcite @xmath76 [ @xmath77 is the effective bohr radius of the dot ] , which is the qd analog to the density parameter @xmath1 in extended systems . as a rough indication ,",
    "consider that for @xmath78 or lower the electronic ground state is liquid , while well above @xmath79 electrons form a `` crystallized '' phase , reminescent of the wigner crystal in the bulk . in the latter phase electrons",
    "are localized in space and arrange themselves in a geometrically ordered configuration such that electrostatic repulsion is minimized .",
    "@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] we study the completeness of the sp basis , plotting the relative error of the ground state energy , as a function of the basis size , in different correlation regimes .",
    "the `` exact '' reference values are taken to be the qmc data , @xcite and the calculated values correspond to adding successive fock - darwin orbital shells of increasing energy to the sp basis ( for a total amount of 3 , 6 , 10 , 15 , 21 , 28 orbitals , respectively ) .",
    "we see that , in the liquid phase ( @xmath80 ) , a basis made of 15 orbitals is sufficient to guarantee a precision of one part over one hundred .",
    "the error , however , depends sensitively on @xmath3 : the smaller the electron number , the higher the precision .",
    "the reason is that , since the confinement potential is soft , electrons tend to move towards the outer qd region as @xmath3 increases , and therefore higher energy orbital shells are needed to build wave functions with larger lateral extension .",
    "a basis made of 21 orbitals , however , is enough to obtain a similar precision for both two- and five - electron ground states ( around 0.1% ) .",
    "figure [ fig : conv ] also shows that , as we move towards the high correlation regime , i.e. , as @xmath81 increases , the error rapidly increases if the sp basis size is kept fixed . for example , when @xmath82 the error for the @xmath83 ground state using 21 orbitals is about 2% , an order - of - magnitude larger than for the liquid regime at @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 turns out to be a crucial parameter for the convergence of the sp basis .",
    "since the main program of donrodrigo ( here referred to as donrodrigo itself ) is the most computationally intensive part of the suite ( cf .  sec .",

    "[ s : code ] , the code has been parallelized using the message passing paradigm based on mpi interface .",
    "this choice has been guided both by the possibility of having a portable code , that could run from small departmental clusters to large supercomputers , and , most of all , by the possibility of using the parpack library , namely the parallel version of the arpack library @xcite used in the scalar code to solve the eigenproblem , which in turn uses mpi . the package is designed to compute a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a general square matrix , and it is most appropriate for sparse matrices ( see the arpack user guide @xcite ) .",

    "see ref .  .",
    "specifically , donrodrigo has been parallelized as follows : in the first part of the code the matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xmath42 to be computed are distributed to the available processes , which then compute all the elements in parallel .",
