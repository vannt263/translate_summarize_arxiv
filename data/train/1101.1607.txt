    "a measurement of the complete breakup of the atomic helium target by xuv radiation was achieved over @xmath3 years ago  @xcite . since then , rapid developments in strong xuv light sources and momentum imaging techniques have made it possible to record all the reaction fragments , nuclei and electrons , in double photoionization of the simplest two - electron hydrogen / deuterium molecule by one - photon absorption  @xcite , and most recently also for two - photon absorption  @xcite . for the double ionization of h@xmath4 by single - photon absorption , only randomly oriented molecules were investigated in earlier experiments ( e.g.  @xcite ) . using",
    " fixed - in - space \" molecules , more recent experimental efforts include the measurements of energy- and angle - resolved differential cross sections by weber _",
    "et al . _",
    "for either equal energy sharing  @xcite or asymmetric energy sharing  @xcite , and by gisselbrecht _",
    "@xcite for equal energy sharing at a photon energy of @xmath5  ev .",
    "these experimental studies were at least partially stimulated by the goal of understanding the similarities and differences between the hydrogen molecule and its atomic counterpart helium .",
    "however , all recorded fully differential cross sections to date suffer from some experimental uncertainties regarding the alignment angle of the molecule with respect to the polarization vector of the laser and the emission angles of the photoelectrons .    from a theoretical point of view , the hydrogen molecule exhibits a significant complexity compared to helium and , therefore , provides an enormous challenge to a fully _ ab initio _ description inherent in a multi - center , multi - electron system .",
    "the single - center convergent close - coupling method was used to model the double ionization of h@xmath4 by kheifets and bray @xcite .",
    "later mccurdy , rescigno , martn and their collaborators  @xcite implemented a formulation based on time - independent exterior complex scaling ( ecs ) in spherical coordinates , with the origin of the coordinate system placed at the center of the molecule , to treat the double photoionization at a photon energy of @xmath0  ev . the radial coordinates of the two electrons are measured from the center , and the radial parts of the wave function were either expanded in @xmath6-splines or using a finite - element discrete - variable representation ( fe - dvr ) .    the time - dependent close - coupling ( tdcc ) method  @xcite , again in spherical coordinates , was also extended to calculate the triple - differential cross section ( tdcs ) for double photoionization of the h@xmath4 molecule . while the agreement between the published tdcss from the ecs  @xcite and tdcc  @xcite calculations is basically acceptable",
    ", noticeable discrepancies remained for a few particular geometries . in the parallel geometry , for instance , where the molecular axis @xmath7 is chosen along the laser polarization vector  @xmath8 , the coplanar tdcs predictions from the ecs and tdcc calculations differ by up to @xmath9  percent when one of the electrons ( we will refer to it as the `` fixed electron '' below ) is observed along the direction perpendicular to the @xmath8-axis . in some other cases ,",
    "there exists a noticeable  wing \" structure in the published tdcc predictions for equal energy sharing .",
    "additional tdcc calculations  @xcite suggest that the agreement can be systematically improved , albeit the above - mentioned discrepancy still exists at a somewhat reduced level .",
    "another independent approach  @xcite to this problem is the very recent time - independent ecs treatment , formulated  as in the current work  in prolate spheroidal coordinates .",
    "quite surprisingly , the results of that calculation differed from both the earlier ecs and also the tdcc predictions , both obtained in spherical coordinates . specifically , the ecs prolate spheroidal calculations showed differences from the earlier spherical coordinate calculation for the tdcss , at a level of about @xmath10 depending on the details of the energy sharing .",
    "as will be demonstrated below , we have gone to considerable lengths in an attempt to resolve these discrepancies .",
    "however , significant differences between the present results and those of the ecs  @xcite still remain .",
    "both the ecs  @xcite and the tdcc  @xcite calculations made some attempt to deal with the experimental uncertainties in the scattering angles .",
    "given the experimental uncertainties and the differences in the previous calculations , however , it appeared worthwhile to investigate the computational effort required to obtain accurate before averaging over any experimental acceptance angles .",
    "consequently , the present calculation represents an independent implementation of the time - dependent fe - dvr approach in prolate spheroidal coordinates . as in the other approaches mentioned above , the internuclear separation ( @xmath11 )",
    "was held fixed at its equilibrium distance of @xmath12  bohr .",
    "the two - center prolate system , with the foci located on the nuclei , provides a suitable description for the two - center characteristics of the h@xmath4 molecule .",
    "the formulation of the schrdinger equation in prolate spheroidal coordinates for diatomic molecules is not new .",
    "the pioneering work of bates , pik , and poots  @xcite for the h@xmath13 ion , which is exactly separable in prolate spheroidal coordinates , already revealed the appealing features of the prolate system .",
    "in particular , the electron - nuclear interaction is rendered benign in this coordinate system .",
    "a partial list of recent applications of prolate spheroidal coordinates to diatomic molecules can be found in  @xcite .",
    "as has been demonstrated in a number of recent publications , a grid - based approach provides a very appropriate description of laser - driven atomic and molecular physics when combined with an efficient time - propagation method such as the short iterative lanczos ( sil ) method  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we employ the fe - dvr / sil approach in prolate spheroidal coordinates to study the correlated response of a two - electron molecule in the double ionization process .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows . after presenting the hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule in section  [ sec.2 ] and providing some details about the discretization of the system in an fe - dvr basis in sec .",

    "the prolate spheroidal coordinates with the two foci separated by a distance  @xmath11 are defined by @xmath14 and the azimuthal angle  @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the distances measured from the two nuclei , respectively .",
    "these coordinates are specified in the ranges @xmath18 , @xmath19 $ ] , and @xmath20 $ ] .",

    "consequently , @xmath1 is the  quasi - radial \" coordinate , while @xmath2 is  quasi - angular \" .",
    "the hamiltonian of a single electron , @xmath27 , ( @xmath28 for the two electrons in h@xmath4 below ) , is written as    @xmath29   -\\frac{4\\xi_q}{r(\\xi_q^2-\\eta_q^2)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) of the laser - driven h@xmath4 molecule ( with two electrons ) in the dipole length gauge : @xmath30\\psi(1,2,t).\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is the coordinate of the @xmath32-th electron measured relative to the center of the molecule and @xmath33 is the interelectronic distance . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose the molecular axis along the @xmath34  axis , and the plane formed by the molecular axis and the polarization vector as the @xmath35  plane .",
    "generally , we can decompose the polarization vector into its two components , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the angle between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 axes , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the unit vectors along the @xmath34 and @xmath42 axes , respectively .",
    "the dipole interaction is therefore given as @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the rectangular coordinates @xmath42 and @xmath34 and the prolate spheroidal coordinates are related through @xmath44 we expand the wave function for the h@xmath4 molecule in the body - frame as @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the angular function , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the magnetic quantum numbers of the two electrons along the molecular axis .",
    "next , @xmath49 is expanded in a product of normalized  radial \" @xmath50 and  angular \" @xmath51 dvr bases : @xmath52 note that the basis is not symmetrized with respect to the coordinates of the two electrons . since we always begin the calculation with a properly symmetrized initial state , however , that symmetry will be preserved in the calculation .    to discretize this partial differential equation",
    ", we employ the fe - dvr approach for both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 variables  @xcite .",
    "if we normalize the dvr bases according to @xmath53 respectively , the overall @xmath54 dvr basis is not normalized with respect to the volume element in the prolate coordinate system .",
    "this is corrected by defining the two - electron basis @xmath55 which satisfies the desired normalization @xmath56 to expand @xmath49 .",
    "specifically , we have @xmath57 introducing the normalized @xmath54 dvr basis eliminates the complexities of matrix operations related to the overlap matrix at each time , and hence makes the standard sil algorithm directly applicable to study the temporal response of the molecule to laser pulses .",
    "in our current implementation of the fe - dvr approach for the time - dependent wave function in prolate spheroidal coordinates , we have chosen to work directly in the fe - dvr basis .",
    "this differs from what is usually done for atoms in spherical coordinates , where spherical harmonics are used for the angular variables and an fe - dvr for the radial coordinates .",
    "consequently , the boundary conditions in prolate spheroidal coordinates require some more discussion . analyzing the asymptotics",
    "reveals that in the region near the boundaries of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which correspond to the molecular axis , the single - electron wave function behaves like @xmath60 .",
    "this indicates that the physical wave function is finite for @xmath61 , whereas it goes to zero in the region close to the molecular axis for @xmath62 .",
    "more importantly , the behavior of the wave function for odd @xmath63 contains a square - root factor , giving a decidedly nonpolynomial behavior to the wave function that is impossible to capture in a straightforward fashion using a dvr basis .",
    "the former problem is readily treated by using a gauss - radau quadrature in the first dvr element for  @xmath1 , where only the right - most point is constrained to lie on the boundary between the first and second finite element .",
    "the volume element ensures that the integrand is well behaved near the end points and makes it unnecessary to invoke a separate quadrature for different @xmath64 values .",
    "for all the other elements , a gauss - lobatto quadrature is employed .",
    "this allows us to make the fe - dvr basis continuous everywhere and to satisfy the @xmath63-dependent boundary condition .    to overcome the nonanalytic behavior of the basis for odd @xmath64 , bachau and collaborators",
    "@xcite explicitly factored out the @xmath60 part before the wave function was expanded in terms of @xmath6-splines in the discretization approach .",
    "we have adopted a similar idea in our fe - dvr treatment of the two - center problem to achieve much faster convergence , as was also done in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the case of even @xmath63 ,",
    "no changes need to be made to define the dvr basis , i.e. , the normalized basis is written as @xmath65 for odd @xmath63 , however , we define the dvr basis as @xmath66 and @xmath67 here @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the weight factors related to the dvr bases @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the goal of using a unique set of mesh points , which are @xmath63-independent , to discretize the @xmath54 coordinates has now been achieved in this scheme .",
    "the same technique was employed in recent calculations of one- and two - photon double ionization of h@xmath4  @xcite . in principle , it is also possible to introduce the factors into the dvr bases to circumvent the difficulties related to the nonanalytic behavior near the boundary . however , this results in an @xmath63-dependence of the dvr bases and quadrature points .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a number of unnecessary complications in the practical implementation of the computational methodology .",
    "one might argue that an discretization procedure could be useful for a system in which the magnetic quantum number @xmath64 is conserved .",
    "an example is the h@xmath13 ion in external magnetic fields along the molecular axis  @xcite .",
    "however , that is not the situation in the current calculation .",
    "similar to the expansion of the electron - electron interaction in terms of spherical coordinates , a counterpart exists in prolate spheroidal coordinates @xcite through the neumann expansion @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the two nuclei are located at @xmath74 along the @xmath34  axis and @xmath75 .",
    "both the regular @xmath76 and irregular @xmath77 legendre functions  @xcite , which are defined in the region @xmath78 , are involved in the expansion as the  radial \" part , while the  angular \" part is only related to @xmath79 .",
    "note that we chose to work in terms of an un - normalized  angular \" basis rather than the usual spherical harmonics .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath80 in a traditional basis , for example , a or slater - type basis , can be computed through the well - known mehler - ruedenberg transformation @xcite . due to the discontinuous derivative along the line of @xmath81 in the neumann expansion , the straightforward computation of the matrix element of @xmath80 , using the value of this interaction potential at the mesh points , is very slowly convergent .",
    "we seek a more robust representation of the @xmath80 matrix which retains both the underlying gauss quadrature and the dvr property of all potentials being exactly diagonal with respect to the highly localized dvr basis .    in the following ,",
    "we use the simplified notation @xmath82 to denote the basis .",
    "essentially , we need the integral @xmath83 after integrating over @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the matrix element of @xmath80 can be written as @xmath86 where the selection rule @xmath87 has been used .",
    "hence @xmath64 is uniquely determined for a given pair of angular partial waves . above we introduced the reduced ( @xmath88 ) integral @xmath89 since @xmath63",
    "is fixed in the above equation , we omitted it in @xmath90 and will do so in the related quantities below as well .",
    "it is now worthwhile to define the two electron densities  @xcite : @xmath91 after truncating the radial integral to the edge of the box , @xmath92 , this yields @xmath93 here a convention for the volume element was made in such a way that , for any function @xmath94 , we define @xmath95 to simplify the notation .",
    "most importantly , the function @xmath96 is defined by @xmath97    instead of evaluating the above integrals directly , we solve the differential equation satisfied by @xmath96 .",
    "as will become apparent later , this equation can be shown to be the  radial \" poisson equation in the prolate spheroidal coordinate system .",
    "the differential equations satisfied by the legendre functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 suggests that we introduce the operator @xmath98 for given quantum numbers @xmath99 and @xmath64 .",
    "this is the one - dimensional laplacian operator in the @xmath1 coordinate .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain @xmath100 and @xmath101 here the wronskian of the legendre functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 is given by @xmath102 consequently , we obtain @xmath103 this is the second - order inhomogeneous poisson equation satisfied by @xmath104 with the  source \" term given by @xmath105 after carrying out the integral over @xmath106 via gauss quadrature , we recast the source term as @xmath107 as one might expect , the inhomogeneous equation reduces to the homogeneous one if @xmath108 .",
    "the solution to the poisson equations ( [ poissoneq ] ) and ( [ boundcond ] ) can be uniquely determined by enforcing the boundary conditions @xmath109 at @xmath58 and @xmath110 at @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "there are two important points to realize , namely : first , on the right - hand boundary , the function @xmath96 assumes a nonzero value , which is given by eq .",
    "( [ bdr ] ) , for all possible @xmath63 values .",
    "its asymptotic behavior relies on the function @xmath77 at large @xmath1 , which behaves like @xmath112 .",
    "this indicates that it is _ nonzero _ generally , although it could be small at the large @xmath92 values used in practical calculations .",
    "second , on the left - hand boundary , the situation depends on the value of @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath104 takes a _",

    "for the one - photon double ionization initialized from the lowest @xmath204 state , the two ejected electrons can only populate the final @xmath205 and @xmath206 continuum states , with the specifics depending on the relative orientation of the molecular axis and the laser polarization vector . consequently only partial waves with _ ungerade _ parity [ i.e. , @xmath207 need to be included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdcs ] ) .",
    "for the nonsequential double - ionization process induced by one- or two - photon absorption , electronic correlation plays a dominant role , as the two photoelectrons must share the available excess energy @xmath190 .",
    "double ionization by a single photon would not occur at all if the two - electron atom or molecule were approximated by an independent - electron model .",
    "therefore , the quality of the description of electron - electron correlation in a laser - driven system is crucially important for accurate results to be obtained . the coulomb interaction between the two electrons has to be described in a consistent manner for both the initial bound state and the time - evolved wave packet .",
    "before we go any further , it is worth discussing how we prepare the initial @xmath204 state at the equilibrium distance of @xmath208 bohr .    as seen from eq .",

    "we need to determine how the approximation introduced in the @xmath2-integrals for the two - electron integrals affects the results for the cross sections of interest .    to answer this question",

    "[ fig : energy ] . in this region of  @xmath137 an unphysically _ low _ energy can be produced . beyond that point ,",
    "the calculated energy increases to the next plateau .    ultimately , this is not too surprising , since any gauss quadrature is only reasonably accurate up to a limited polynomial order of the integrand .",
    "consequently , if we want to keep more terms in the neumann expansion , we have to increase @xmath213 correspondingly .",
    "this finding is further substantiated by the dependence of the energy found for @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "the plateaus are indeed extended to the correspondingly larger values of @xmath215 .",
    "most importantly , the amplitude of the energy fluctuation is systematically reduced with increasing @xmath213 .",

    "this indicates that the perpendicular component of the temporal electric field exerts more influence on the ionization process due to the larger dipole momentum .",

    "however , once the electric field has become sufficiently strong ( @xmath237  a.u . ) , the wave packet is driven out and spread into a larger space .",
    "this leads to lower minima in @xmath236 for the tilted molecule .",
    "when the wave packet is driven back to the nuclear region and therefore has a chance to recombine with the h@xmath13 ion , a maximum in @xmath236 appears .",
