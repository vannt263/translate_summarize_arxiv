    "recently because of the development of quantum computers@xcite people have become interested in information transmission through quantum channels@xcite .",
    "quantum information theories@xcite can be used to describe processes such as data storage , quantum cryptography@xcite and quantum teleportation@xcite . however , after an initial burst of papers following shor s discover of quantum factoring algorithm@xcite , almost every work is aiming to solve the decoherence problem which is responsible for transition into effectively classical behaviour@xcite .",
    "there are people using nmr techniques , which provide longer decoherence time than previous techniques , claiming they can built a quantum computer with a cup of coffee@xcite .",
    "there are also people trying to use various software methods , in particular , quantum error correcting codes , to correct decoherence induced errors .",
    "the decoherence problem lay at the heart of the development of quantum mechanics .",
    "apparently , decoherence is a hurdle need to be surmounted before quantum computers can be materialized .",
    "however , is decoherence , the counterpart of classical noise , really nuisance ? for people who know stochastic resonance@xcite , the answer is perhaps no. decoherence can be perhaps used as a resource as entanglement had .    in two previous papers",
    "we have considered the noise effects on the two - pauli channels@xcite and the depolarizing channels@xcite using the concept from stochastic resonance .",
    "there is a question that whether does the results obtained so far consistent with the classical results ?",
    "for the two - pauli channel and depolarizing channel , it is not possible to check because they consist of flipping the phase of the qubits ( quantum bits ) @xcite which has no classical counter part .",
    "however , it might be possible to consider a one - pauli channel that only flip the qubits amplitude .",
    "the @xmath0 channel can be viewed as a binary symmetric channel , while @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels are @xmath0 channel in a dual basis .",
    "furthermore , we still do not know what are the noise effects for each pauli operator separately .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will consider three different one - pauli channels to see how will the noise influence their capacity and fidelity .",
    "the classical world is made from different material . however , in the quantum world all objects are made of the same elementary particles .",
    "the particles are in different states of superposition .",
    "only the information describing them are different .    in the classical world",
    "the information is coded as _ bits _ and is described by @xmath3 or @xmath4 , while the quantum world the information is coded as _",
    "qubit _ and is described by the corresponding _",
    "density matrix_.    schumacher and nielsen @xcite have developed a quantum information theory to describe the information processing in the quantum world . in their formulation",
    "a quantum channel can be considered as a process defined by an input density matrix @xmath5 , and an output density matrix @xmath6 , with the process described by a quantum operation , @xmath7 , @xmath8 because of decoherence , the super - operator @xmath9 is not unitary . however , on a larger quantum system that includes the environment @xmath10 of the system , the total evolution operator @xmath11 become unitary .",
    "this environment may be considered to be initially in a pure state @xmath12 without loss of generality . in this case , the super - operator can be written as @xmath13 the partial trace , @xmath14 , is taken over environmental degree of freedom , and @xmath15 means a direct product for the spaces on both sides of the operator .",
    "( [ channel ] ) can be rewritten as a completely positive linear transformation acting on the density matrix : @xmath16 in which the @xmath17 satisfy the completeness relation @xmath18 which is equivalent to requiring @xmath19=1 $ ] .",
    "the mutual information of a classical channel with classical sources , written using quantum formalism become@xcite @xmath20 in which @xmath21 $ ] is the von neumann entropy@xcite , and @xmath22 with @xmath23 measures the amount of information exchanged between the system @xmath24 and the environment @xmath10 during their interaction@xcite , which can be used to characterize the amount of quantum noise , @xmath25 , in the channel .",
    "if the environment is initially in a pure state , the entropy exchange is just the environment s entropy after the interaction .",
    "hence , the coherent information is defined as @xmath26 which plays a role in quantum information theory analogous to that played by the mutual information in classical information theory .",
    "in what follows the influence of noise on three kinds of one - pauli channels with a general input state @xmath27 is considered . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the identity matrix , @xmath29 is the bloch vector of length unity or less , and @xmath30 is the vector of pauli matrices , which are defined as @xmath31 the output of the channel can always be written as @xmath32 two more definitions are needed in our computing for the channel properties : the von neumann entropy is @xmath33 in which @xmath34s are the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the ( entangled ) fidelity @xmath35 is also of our concern , since it represent the quality of the signal transmitted .",

    "in conclusion we found , as far as the coherent information and fidelity are concerned , these three one - pauli channels are the same except for the fidelity of the @xmath1 channel . this is perhaps the reason that we found in the previous works why there is noise enhancement of the fidelity but could not find noise enhancement for the coherent information ."
