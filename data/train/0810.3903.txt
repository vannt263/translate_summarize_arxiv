    "neutrino - induced charged current single charged pion production ( cc-1@xmath1 ) is dominated by baryonic resonance excitation off a single nucleon bound in a nucleus in the neutrino energy region of a few gev .",
    "the resonance state is followed by its prompt decay into a nucleon and a pion in the final state .",
    "the process is written as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is proton or neutron .",
    "in addition to this reaction , neutrinos can produce pions by interacting coherently with the nucleons forming the target nucleus .",
    "the process is expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a nucleus .",
    "understanding the cross sections of these processes is important to study @xmath0 oscillation near one gev . in such oscillation experiments , a distortion in the @xmath6 energy spectrum",
    "is measured with charged current quasi - elastic ( cc - qe ) interactions , @xmath7 , by reconstructing neutrino energy from the measured muon momentum and angle .",
    "the background to this channel is dominated by cc-1@xmath1 events in which the pion is not observed so that the final state looks like a cc - qe interaction .",
    "this mis - identification comes from the lack of the final state @xmath1 detection due to low energy as well as pion absorption inside the nucleus . in case of the t2k experiment  @xcite , a next generation long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment ,",
    "the cc-1@xmath1/cc - qe cross section ratio is required to be understood at 5% level to keep the resulting error on the oscillation parameters comparable to that due to statistical uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "however , the current knowledge of the cross section ratio has been limited by low statistics and large systematic uncertainty , and therefore a precision measurement of the cross section is essential .",
    "in addition , recent results on coherent pion production have induced interest of the neutrino physics community .",
    "the non - existence of cc coherent pion production in a 1.3  gev wide - band neutrino beam has been reported by k2k  @xcite , while there exist cc coherent pion production positive results at higher neutrino energies .",
    "on the one hand , evidence for nc coherent pion production in the similar neutrino energy has been recently reported by miniboone  @xcite .",
    "the sciboone experiment  @xcite is designed to measure the neutrino cross sections on carbon in the one gev region .",
    "the experiment uses the booster neutrino beam ( bnb ) at fermilab . the primary proton beam , with kinetic energy 8  gev ,",
    "is extracted to strike a 71  cm long , 1  cm diameter beryllium target .",
    "each beam spill consists of 81 bunches of protons , containing typically @xmath8 protons in a total spill duration of 1.6  @xmath9sec .",
    "the target sits at the upstream end of a magnetic focusing horn that is pulsed with approximately 170  ka to focus the mesons , primarily @xmath1 , produced by the @xmath10 interactions . in a 50 m long decay pipe following",
    "the horn , @xmath1 decay and produce neutrinos , before the mesons encounter an absorber .",
    "the flux is dominated by muon neutrinos ( 93% of total ) , with small contributions from muon antineutrinos ( 6.4% ) , and electron neutrinos and antineutrinos ( 0.6% in total ) .",
    "the flux - averaged mean neutrino energy is 0.7 gev .",
    "when the horn polarity is reversed , @xmath11 are focused and hence a predominantly antineutrino beam is created .",
    "the sciboone detector is located 100 m downstream from the neutrino production target .",
    "the detector complex consists of three sub - detectors : a fully active fine grained scintillator tracking detector ( scibar ) , an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ec ) and a muon range detector ( mrd ) .",
    "the scibar detector consists of 14,336 extruded plastic scintillator strips , each @xmath12  @xmath13 .",
    "the scintillators are arranged vertically and horizontally to construct a @xmath14 m@xmath15 volume with a total mass of 15 tons .",
    "each strip is read out by a wavelength - shifting ( wls ) fiber attached to a 64-channel multi - anode pmt ( ma - pmt ) .",
    "charge and timing information from each ma - pmt is recorded by custom electronics .",
    "the minimum length of a reconstructed track is 8  cm which corresponds to a proton with momentum of 450  mev/@xmath16 .",
    "the ec is installed downstream of scibar , and consists of 32 vertical and 32 horizontal modules made of scintillating fibers embedded in lead foils .",
    "each module has dimensions of @xmath17 @xmath13 , and is read out by two 1  pmts on both ends .",
    "the ec has a thickness of @xmath18 along the beam direction to measure @xmath19 emitted from neutrino interactions and the intrinsic @xmath20 contamination .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath21}}$ ] .",
    "the mrd is located downstream of the ec in order to measure the momentum of muons up to 1.2 gev@xmath22 with range .",
    "it consists of 12 layers of 2-thick iron plates sandwiched between layers of 6 mm - thick plastic scintillator planes .",
    "the cross sectional area of each plate is @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical scintillator planes are arranged alternately , and the total number of scintillators is 362 .",
    "the experiment took both neutrino and antineutrino data from june  2007 until august  2008 . in total , @xmath25  pot were delivered to the beryllium target during the sciboone data run . after beam and detector quality cuts , @xmath26  pot",
    "are usable for physics analyses ; @xmath27  pot for neutrino data and @xmath28  pot for antineutrino data .",
    "preliminary results from the full neutrino data sample are presented in this paper .",
    "the experimental signature of cc single charged pion production is the existence of two and only two tracks originating from a common vertex , both consistent with minimum ionizing particles ( a muon and a charged pion ) . even in case of a cc resonant pion event with proton in the final state , @xmath29 ,",
    "the proton is often not reconstructed due to its low energy .    to identify cc events ,",
    "we search for tracks in scibar matching with a track or hits in the mrd .",
    "such a track is defined as a scibar - mrd matched track .",
    "the most energetic scibar - mrd matched track in any event is considered as the muon candidate .",
    "the matching criteria impose a muon momentum threshold of 350  mev/@xmath16 .",
    "the neutrino interaction vertex is reconstructed as the upstream edge of the muon candidate .",
    "we select events whose vertices are in the scibar fiducial volume ( fv ) , @xmath30 , a total mass of 10.6  tons .",
    "finally , event timing is required to be within 2  @xmath9sec beam timing window .",
    "the cosmic - ray background contamination in the beam timing window is only 0.5% , estimated using a beam - off timing window .",
    "approximately 30,000 events are selected as our standard cc sample . according to the mc simulation ,",
    "the selection efficiency and purity of true @xmath6 cc events are 28% and 93% , respectively .    in order to reconstruct muon momentum from its range",
    ", the muon candidate is required to stop in the mrd . once the muon candidate and the neutrino interaction vertex are reconstructed , we search for other tracks originating from the vertex",
    ". events with two and only two vertex - matched tracks are selected .",
    "the scibar detector has the capability to distinguish protons from muons and pions using @xmath31 .",
    "the particle identification variable , muon confidence level ( mucl ) is related to the probability that a particle is a minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) based on the energy deposition .",
    "the confidence level at each plane is first defined as the fraction of events in the expected @xmath31 distribution of muons above the observed value .",
    "the expected @xmath31 distribution of muons is obtained by using cosmic - ray muons .",
    "each plane s confidence level is combined to form a total confidence level , assuming the confidence level at each layer is independent . the particle identification is applied to both tracks to select events with two mip - like tracks ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the probability of mis - identification is estimated to be 1.1% for muons and 12% for protons .    after selecting @xmath32 events",
    ", the sample still contains cc - qe events in which a proton is mis - identified as a mip - like track .",
    "we reduce cc - qe background by using kinematic information .",
    "since the cc - qe interaction is a two - body interaction , one can predict the proton direction from the measured muon momentum and muon angle .",
    "we define an angle called @xmath33 as the angle between the expected proton track direction and the observed second track direction . in cc - qe events , the angle @xmath34 is expected to be small , and",
    "therefore we select events in which @xmath34 is greater than 20  degrees to reject cc - qe background . with this selection , 48% of cc - qe events in the @xmath32 sample",
    "are rejected .",
    "we select approximately 2,000 cc-1@xmath1 candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig : pmuthetamu_cc1pi.eps ] shows reconstructed muon momentum and angle with respect to the neutrino beam direction for cc-1@xmath1 sample . for the mc simulation , the contributions from each interaction mode are shown separately . according to the mc simulation , the fraction of cc resonant pion production ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and",
    "cc coherent pion production in the sample is 34% , 11% , and 15% , respectively .",
    "as seen in the figure , the deficit of data in the small muon angle region is found .",
    "further investigation has been performed by extracting cc coherent pion events .",
    "cc coherent pion events are separated from cc resonant pion events by using their characteristic kinematic information .",
    "because of the small momentum transfer to the target nucleus , both the muon and pion go in the forward direction .",
    "events in which a pion candidate goes forward are selected .",
    "the additional protons with momentum below the tracking threshold are detected by their large energy deposition around the vertex , so - called vertex activity .",
    "we search for the maximum deposited energy in a strip around the vertex , an area of @xmath37 in both views .",
    "events with the energy deposition less than 10 mev are considered to have no vertex activity and selected .",
    "figure  [ fig : q2rec_coherent.eps ] shows reconstructed @xmath38 assuming cc - qe kinematics for the cc coherent pion sample . although a cc - qe interaction is assumed , the @xmath38 of cc coherent pion events is reconstructed with a resolution of 0.02  ( gev/@xmath16)@xmath39 and a shift of -0.02  ( gev/@xmath16)@xmath39 according to the mc simulation . finally , events with reconstructed @xmath38 less than 0.1  ( gev/@xmath16)@xmath39 are selected as cc coherent pion candidates .",
    "the selection efficiency of cc coherent pion production is 11% , and the mean neutrino energy after accounting for the selection efficiency is 1.1  gev , both estimated with the mc simulation .",
    "the observed cc coherent pion sample contains fewer events than our mc prediction which is based on the rein - sehgal model with lepton mass correction  @xcite .",
    "our 90% c.l .",
    "sensitivity on the cross section ratio of cc coherent pion production to total cc interaction is estimated to be 0.004 , which corresponds to 20% of the mc prediction .     assuming cc - qe kinematics for cc coherent pion sample.,height=264 ]",
    "in summary , we present preliminary results on charged current single charged pion production , analyzing the full neutrino data corresponding to @xmath27 pot . observed cc coherent pion sample contains fewer events than our mc prediction which is based on the rein and sehgal model .",
    "our 90% c.l .",
    "sensitivity on the cross section ratio of cc coherent pion production to total cc interaction is 0.004 at the mean neutrino energy of 1.1  gev . after measuring cc coherent pion production , the measurement on cc resonant pion production will be performed .",
