    "in this paper , the word _ surface _ refers to a connected orientable surface of finite or infinite topological type . to motivate our results",
    ", we review some basic preliminary facts about teichmller spaces of surfaces of infinite topological type .      given a surface @xmath0 , its teichmller space is a parameter space of some homotopy classes of complex structures on @xmath0 .",
    "there are several possible ways for defining what is the set of homotopy classes one wants to parametrize and which topology one wants to put on this set .",
    "usually it is not necessary to worry too much about the details , because in the most common case considered , i.e. the case when @xmath0 is a closed surface , the set is just the set of all possible homotopy classes of complex structures , and all `` reasonable '' possible definitions of a topology on that set give the same topology .",
    "therefore , in the case of closed surfaces , this freedom to choose between several possible definitions is not a problem , it is , instead , a very useful tool in the theory : one can choose the definition that best suits the problem studied .    as soon as we leave the setting of closed surfaces , it is necessary to be more careful with the definitions .",
    "in this paper we deal with surfaces of infinite topological type , and in this case the different possible definitions do not always agree .",
    "first of all , it is necessary to choose a basepoint , i.e. a base complex structure @xmath1 on the surface @xmath0 , and then to consider only the set of homotopy classes of complex structures on @xmath0 that are `` comparable '' with @xmath1 in a suitable sense .",
    "this notion of comparability usually suggests a good definition of the topology .",
    "for example , the most commonly used definition is what we call the _ quasiconformal _ teichmller space , where the set @xmath2 parametrizes all the homotopy classes of complex structures @xmath3 on @xmath0 that are quasiconformally equivalent to @xmath1 , i.e. such that there exists a quasiconformal homeomorphism between @xmath1 and @xmath3 that is homotopic to the identity of @xmath0 .",
    "( note that the space @xmath2 we consider here is the reduced teichmller space i.e. homotopies need not fix the ideal boundary point - wise . )",
    "the topology on @xmath2 is given by the quasiconformal distance @xmath4 , also called the teichmller distance , defined using quasiconformal dilatations of quasiconformal homeomorphisms : for any two homotopy classes of complex structures @xmath5 , their quasiconformal distance @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the quasiconformal dilatation of a quasiconformal homeomorphism @xmath9 which is homotopic to the identity .",
    "in @xcite , we studied the quasiconformal teichmller space of a surface of infinite topological type using pair of pants decompositions and fenchel - nielsen coordinates .",
    "we will use this technique also in this paper , so we recall some of the main facts we need here .",
    "the definition of these coordinates depends on the interpretation of every complex structure as a hyperbolic metric on the surface .",
    "to do so , we use the intrinsic hyperbolic metric on a complex surface , defined by bers . for complex structures of the first type",
    "( i.e. if the ideal boundary is empty ) this metric is just the poincar metric , but for complex structures of the second type it is different from this well known metric . for these notions and for other related notions ,",
    "we refer the reader to the paper @xcite for the details of this definition and for explanations about how the intrinsic metric may differ from the poincar metric .",
    "this metric has the property that every puncture of the surface shows one of the following behaviors :    1 .",
    "it has a neighborhood isometric to a cusp , i.e. , the quotient of @xmath10 , for some @xmath11 , by the group generated by the translation @xmath12 .",
    "it is possible to glue to the puncture a boundary component that is a simple closed geodesic for the hyperbolic metric .",
    "punctures of this kind will be called boundary components , and the boundary geodesic will be considered as part of the surface .    for infinite - type surfaces we proved in @xcite that given a topological pair of pants decomposition @xmath13 of @xmath0 and a complex structure @xmath3 on @xmath0 ,",
    "it is always possible to find geodesics @xmath14 for the intrinsic metric of @xmath3 such that each @xmath15 is homotopic to @xmath16 and the set @xmath14 is again a pair of pants decomposition of @xmath0 . to every curve @xmath16 of the topological decomposition we can associate two numbers @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is",
    "the length in @xmath3 of the geodesic @xmath15 and @xmath19 is the twist parameter between the two pairs of pants ( which can be the same ) with geodesic boundary adjacent to @xmath15 . in this paper ,",
    "the twist parameter is a length , and this is a slight change in notation with reference to the paper @xcite , where it was an `` angle '' parameter .",
    "let @xmath1 be a complex structure equipped with a geodesic pants decomposition @xmath20 .",
    "we say that the pair @xmath21 is _ upper - bounded _ if @xmath22 .",
    "we say that the pair @xmath21 is _ lower - bounded _",
    "if @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath21 is both upper - bounded and lower - bounded , then we say that @xmath21 satisfies _ shiga s property _",
    "( this property was first used by shiga in @xcite ) . note that if @xmath1 is of finite type , then any pants decomposition of @xmath1 satisfies shiga s property .",
    "shiga s property was introduced in @xcite , and we used it in our papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note however that this property is used in a weaker form in these papers @xcite and @xcite , and this is also the form which will be useful in the present paper .",
    "in fact , we shall say from now on that shiga s property holds for the pair @xmath21 if the pants decomposition @xmath24 is upper - bounded and there exists a positive constant @xmath25 such that @xmath26 for any @xmath27 which is in the interior of the surface .    in this paper",
    ", we will often use another condition , we say that @xmath28 admits _ short interior curves _ if there is a sequence of curves of the pair of pants decomposition @xmath29 such that the curves @xmath30 are not boundary components of the surface and such that @xmath31 tends to zero .    in the paper @xcite",
    ", we proved that if @xmath21 is upper - bounded , then the quasiconformal teichmller space @xmath32 is locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to the sequence space @xmath33 , using fenchel - nielsen coordinates .",
    "an analogous result , in the case of the non - reduced teichmller space , is due to fletcher , see @xcite and the survey by fletcher and markovic @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study a different definition of teichmller space , which we call the length - spectrum teichmller space .",
    "the definition of this space and of its distance depend on a measure of how the lengths of essential curves change when we change the complex structure .",
    "a simple closed curve on a surface is said to be _ essential _ if it is not homotopic to a point or to a puncture ( but it can be homotopic to a boundary component ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the set of homotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on @xmath1 .",
    "given a complex structure @xmath3 on @xmath0 and an essential simple closed curve @xmath35 on @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath36 the length , for the intrinsic metric on @xmath3 , of the unique geodesic that is homotopic to @xmath35 . the value @xmath36 does not change if we take another complex structure homotopic to @xmath3 , hence this function is well defined on homotopy classes of complex structures on @xmath0 .",
    "given two homotopy classes @xmath37 of complex structures on @xmath0 , we define the functional    @xmath38    given a base complex structure @xmath1 on @xmath0 , the _ length - spectrum _ teichmller space @xmath39 is the space of homotopy classes of complex structures @xmath3 on @xmath0 satisfying @xmath40 .    for any two distinct elements @xmath41",
    ", we have @xmath42 .",
    "we define a metric @xmath43 on @xmath39 , called the _ length - spectrum distance _ , by setting @xmath44    historically , the length - spectrum distance was defined before the length - spectrum teichmller space .",
    "initially people considered this distance as a distance on the quasiconformal teichmller space : they studied the metric space @xmath45 . for finite type surfaces",
    "this is a perfectly fine distance on @xmath2 , it makes this space complete and it induces the ordinary topology , and it is more suitable for studying problems regarding lengths of geodesics . for an example of a paper studying this space , see @xcite , some of whose results we will use in the following .    the first paper dealing with the space @xmath45 in the case of surfaces of infinite type was @xcite .",
    "we proved in @xcite that the metric space @xmath45 is , in general , not complete .",
    "more precisely this happens if there exists a pair of pants decomposition @xmath13 such that the pair @xmath46 admits short interior curves , i.e. if there is a sequence of curves of the pair of pants decomposition @xmath29 contained in the interior of @xmath1 with @xmath47 .",
    "the idea was to construct a sequence of hyperbolic metrics by large twists along short curves . to be more precise , for any @xmath48",
    ", we have again @xmath49 .",
    "denote by @xmath50 the surface obtained from @xmath3 by a twist of magnitude @xmath51 along @xmath52 and let @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "then we proved that @xmath55 , while @xmath56 .",
    "if we set @xmath57 and if we define @xmath58 to be the surface obtained from @xmath3 by a twist of magnitude @xmath59 along @xmath60 for every @xmath61 , then a similar argument shows that @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; see @xcite , @xcite for more details .",
    "we shall give another proof of the last result in section [ sec : main ] below .    the fact that the metric space @xmath45 is , in general , not complete is an indication of the fact that @xmath2 is not the right space for this distance .",
    "the length - spectrum teichmller space was defined in @xcite , with the idea that it was the most natural space for that distance , and it was studied in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we proved in @xcite that for every base complex structure @xmath1 , the metric space @xmath64 is complete .",
    "this result answered a question raised in @xcite ( question 2.22 ) .",
    "other properties , such as connectedness and contractibility , are unknown in the general case for surfaces of infinite type . if the basepoint @xmath1 satisfies shiga s condition",
    ", then it follows from the main result of @xcite that @xmath64 is homeomorphic to the sequence space @xmath33 with an homeomorphism that is locally bi - lipschitz , and , in particular , the space is contractible .",
    "one of the results we prove in the present paper is the following .",
    "[ thm : path ] if @xmath21 is upper - bounded and it admits short interior curves , then @xmath65 is path - connected .    to obtain this result , we will need some results about the comparison between the quasiconformal and the length - spectrum spaces ( see below ) , and we will also need the following explicit characterization of the length - spectrum teichmller space in terms of fenchel - nielsen coordinates , which is interesting in itself :    [ thm : iff ] assume @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath3 lies in @xmath39 if and only if there is a constant @xmath67 such that for each @xmath61 , @xmath68 and @xmath69      it is interesting to compare the two spaces @xmath65 with @xmath70 .    a classical result of sorvali @xcite and wolpert @xcite states that for any @xmath71-quasiconformal map @xmath72 and any @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 it follows from this result that there is a natural inclusion map @xmath75 and that this map is @xmath76-lipschitz .    in @xcite we proved that if @xmath1 satisfies the shiga s condition , then this inclusion is surjective , showing that under this hypothesis we have @xmath77 as sets . in the same paper we also gave an example of a complex structure @xmath1 such that the inclusion map @xmath78 is not surjective .    the inverse map of @xmath78 ( defined on the image set @xmath2 ) is not always continuous .",
    "shiga gave in @xcite an example of a hyperbolic structure @xmath1 on a surface of infinite type and a sequence @xmath79 of hyperbolic structures in @xmath80 which satisfy @xmath81 in particular , the metrics @xmath43 and @xmath4 do not induce the same topology on @xmath2 .",
