    "recently @xcite , we have studied the collision of two @xmath0-dimensional aichelburg - sexl ( as ) shock waves @xcite , using a method first developed ( in @xmath2 ) by death and payne @xcite , with the goal of obtaining the radiated energy .",
    "this method is conceptually and technically elaborate , involving both analytical and numerical studies . remarkably , the fraction of radiated energy - which we refer to as the _ inelasticity of the collision _ - agrees in first order perturbation theory , within the numerical error of the method ( less than 0.1% ) , with the simple formula _",

    "[ miracle ] asymptotically , @xmath3 , which agrees with the _ bound _",
    ", @xmath4 , obtained by computing the apparent horizon ( ah ) on the past light cone @xcite ( or on the future one @xcite ) for a head - on collision of two as shock waves : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the volume of the unit @xmath7-sphere .",
    "moreover , the trend with @xmath0 observed from @xmath8 agrees , qualitatively , with that of @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "an immediate question is if the appeal and simplicity of the result is kept in higher order perturbation theory . to answer it , the @xmath0 dimensional formalism developed in @xcite",
    "must be extended beyond linearised theory and , in particular , so does the radiation extraction method . in @xcite , we have approached the problem of extracting the gravitational radiation by using the landau - lifshitz pseudo - tensor , which was straightforward to apply for the setup therein .",
    "indeed , the first order calculation amounts to approximating the outgoing radiation by an isotropic flux , with a value obtained as the limit of the flux at the axis computed in linearised theory .",
    "this allowed us to obtain a relatively simple expression from the pseudo - tensor , since only the radiation in the direction of the symmetry axis had to be computed . in higher order perturbation theory , on the other hand , we will have to include higher order contributions to the news function , following @xcite , which means that the pseudo - tensor components become more complicated , making this method less manageable and clear",
    ". we shall therefore , in this paper , discuss the higher order perturbative formalism with a different radiation extraction method , valid for generic axially symmetric spacetimes , based on the bondi mass loss formula in @xmath0 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we shall obtain a formula for the inelasticity which is valid to all orders ( cf . ) , and which makes closer contact with the original payne and death computation @xcite , since it uses the natural generalisation to higher @xmath0 of the bondi news function used by these authors .",
    "in linearised theory , of course , the result obtained using the bondi mass loss formula coincides with the pseudo - tensor method .",
    "the second part of this paper is devoted to the study of a collision of shocks obtained from infinitely boosted charged particles .",
    "such shocks were constructed in @xcite and considered in @xcite to estimate an upper bound on the inelasticity , motivated by tev gravity scenarios @xcite ( see @xcite , sec . 4 , for a recent review ) .",
    "in performing this study , our goal is to probe the validity of a perturbative method to study a process that , at its core , includes a non - perturbative phenomenon - black hole formation .",
    "as it turns out , this example illustrates quite well how the method ceases to work , and creates a clear contrast with the neutral case .",
    "the reason why the method fails in such a case is that the repulsive nature of the charged gravitational source implies that an important contribution to the radiation , in the perturbative approach , is obtained from the strong field region . in reality , this contribution , or at least an important part of it , should be cloaked by a horizon , as it would be manifest in a non - perturbative computation .",
    "thus , in this example , the perturbative approach entangles the physical signal with a significative spurious signal , making the method uninformative .",
    "by contrast , in the neutral case , the spurious signal appears to be subleading .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ eq : generalframework ]",
    "we shall set up the higher dimensional perturbation theory for the problem at hand and derive the formula for the inelasticity , leaving some technical details , related to the transformations between the various coordinate systems involved , to appendix [ app : bondi ] . in section [ sec_charge ] we discuss the charged case .",
    "althought we have tried to make the discussion self - contained , the construction uses some details provided in @xcite .",
    "two technical issues , the gauge fixing to de donder coordinates and the evaluation of the integral solution for the perturbative metric , were organized as appendices [ gaugetransformation ] and [ app : simplify ] .",
    "we close with some final remarks - section [ sec_final_rem ] .",
    "in  @xcite we have shown that , in a boosted frame , the metric on the future light cone of the collision of two higher dimensional aichelburg - sexl shock waves is given by a perturbative series : @xmath10=\\nu^{\\frac{2}{d-3}}\\left[\\eta _ { \\mu \\nu}+\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\nu}\\right)^i h_{\\mu\\nu}^{(i)}\\right]\\ .\\label{eq : pertexpansion}\\ ] ] here , @xmath11 are the energy parameters of the weak / strong shock in the boosted frame , respectively , and the background flat metric in null coordinates is @xmath12 @xmath13 is the line element of the unit @xmath14 sphere .",
    "we call this coordinate system _ brinkmann coordinates _",
    "@xcite , where the retarded and advanced times @xmath15 are @xmath16 in terms of minkowski coordinates , and @xmath17 are the remaining cartesian coordinates on the plane of the shocks , @xmath18 , such that the transverse radius is @xmath19 . in this section",
    "we will have two further types of coordinates : i ) _ de donder _ coordinates and ii ) _ bondi _ coordinates , both to be introduced and explained below .",
    "since the de donder coordinates coincide with brinkmann coordinates outside the future light cone of the collision , we adopt the same notation for brinkmann and de donder coordinates ( as in  @xcite ) .",
    "the superposition of two shock waves produces boundary conditions on @xmath20 ( the location of the strong shock ) which go up to second order .",
    "thus , in second order perturbation theory , the boundary conditions are exact . suggestively , for @xmath2 , the second order result coincides with the outcome of numerical relativity simulations @xcite .",
    "this sharpens the motivation to pursue this computation ( at least ) to second order .",
    "the general perturbative method consists of the following steps .",
    "once we have the boundary data for the perturbation @xmath21 , we insert the ansatz   into the einstein equations and equate order by order .",
    "the components of the metric perturbations do not decouple immediately , but we can perform a gauge transformation to the so called de donder coordinates so that they indeed decouple .",
    "we take the perturbative gauge transformation in the form @xmath22 where the vector @xmath23 is to be determined order by order so that the de donder gauge condition is obeyed ; i.e. for @xmath24 @xmath25 ( barred quantities are trace reversed )",
    ". now @xmath26 are the metric perturbations in de donder coordinates .    using   and  ,",
    "the @xmath7-th order perturbation components obey decoupled wave equations @xmath27 \\ , \\ ] ] where the source on the right hand side is generated by the lower order perturbations , and can be computed explicitely order by order .",
    "the general integral solution of   can be written using the green s function method ( see theorem  6.3.1 of  @xcite ) @xmath28 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the finite part of the integral , @xmath30 and we have used the fact that the source only has support in @xmath24 . due to the axial symmetry of the problem , a basis of vectors and tensors on the transverse plane , constructed from @xmath31 and @xmath32 , is @xmath33 where we have chosen the last tensor to be traceless .",
    "then , the metric perturbations in de donder coordinates are decomposed into seven functions of @xmath34 , here denoted @xmath35 , in the following way : @xmath36 with this setup , using the boundary condition on @xmath37 and the solution  , one can find the metric perturbations by solving for these scalars after suitable contractions of   with the tensors  .      as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", we shall here construct an energy extraction method which is the higher @xmath0 generalisation of the original method used by death and payne , based on bondi s news function .",
    "the @xmath0 dimensional extension of the news function formalism has been recently addressed in  @xcite , where the following mass loss formula for the bondi mass @xmath38 was derived : @xmath39}\\dot{\\mathfrak{h}}^{[1]\\hat i\\hat j}d\\omega_{d-2 } \\ .\\ ] ] the dot denotes derivative with respect to the retarded time @xmath40 ; the @xmath41 latin indices are raised with the metric components @xmath42 ; all these quantities , together with the metric functions appearing inside the integral , will be defined in the following .",
    "the geometry we are considering in de donder coordinates has the generic form @xmath43 we can transform it to coordinates @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the angle with the @xmath48 axis and @xmath49 are the angles on the transverse plane , and we have used an index with a prime to denote these new coordinates . then the metric reads : @xmath50 where the various components @xmath51 are defined in appendix  [ app : bondi ] in terms of the seven aforementioned scalar functions .",
    "next , we change to bondi coordinates @xmath52 , related to these intermediate coordinates through the transformation @xmath53 such that the new @xmath54 and @xmath55 metric components vanish , and the form of the metric becomes @xmath56 here @xmath57 and the radial coordinate @xmath58 is chosen such that @xmath59 once found such coordinates , assuming that we have an asymptotically flat spacetime with gravitational radiation , it follows that asymptotically  @xcite @xmath60}}{\\hat r^{d/2+k-1 } } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the metric on the unit @xmath62-sphere and @xmath63 runs over all integers for @xmath0 even and over semi - integers for @xmath0 odd .",
    "this defines the @xmath64}$ ] components appearing in the mass loss formula  .    due to the axial symmetry of our problem one needs",
    "not , in fact , transform the angles on the transverse plane , i.e. @xmath65 , and @xmath66 from condition  , we can then eliminate @xmath67 in terms of @xmath68 and find that asymptotically @xmath69 so the mass loss formula can be written as a @xmath70 angular integral of the following angular power flux @xmath71 ^ 2 \\ ; .\\ ] ] using the general form of our metric in de donder coordinates  , we have constructed the coordinate transformation   in appendix  [ app : bondi ] .",
    "one then shows that @xmath72 ^ 2 \\ , \\ ] ] where all functions are evaluated with bondi coordinates .",
    "an important remark is that our derivation does not rely on the metric being perturbative , and therefore it is valid _ non - perturbatively_. the assumptions are simply : i ) the metric is expressed in de donder coordinates as in eq .  ;",
    "ii ) the metric is axisymmetric , cf .",
    "iii ) the spacetime is asymptotically flat and contains gravitational radiation , cf .",
    "eq .  .",
    "furthermore , asymptotically , the bondi coordinates used in   will approach de donder coordinates , from the construction in appendix  [ app : bondi ] .",
    "so , in general , we can express the mass loss formula in de donder coordinates as = - _ r + ^2  .",
    "[ eq : bondiadapted ] observe that the @xmath73 terms correspond to fluxes across @xmath74 surfaces , which are supposed to vanish on @xmath75 , as argued in  @xcite , for the problem of gravitational shock wave collisions ( indeed we have checked this numerically ) .",
    "we shall now specialize the general formula  , as to facilitate the application of this result to the perturbative problem of shock wave collisions .",
    "we assume spacetime has an adm energy scale @xmath76 , with which we construct a length scale @xmath77 .",
    "then , taking units with @xmath78 , and dividing by the total adm energy scale , the inelasticity factor , corresponding to the fraction of radiated energy into gravitational waves , is @xmath79 with @xmath80 @xmath81 is the generalisation of the bondi news function ( integrated over @xmath82 ) to higher dimensions . in the appropriate limit , this ( more general ) result reduces to the one obtained in @xcite using the landau - lifschitz method .    in the particular case of the perturbative method for shock wave collisions ,",
    "the framework is valid for @xmath47 close to @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "then , the approximation taken is usually to expand around the axis , and extrapolate off the axis by integrating the truncated expansion over @xmath47 . besides being axially symmetric ,",
    "our system is invariant under reflections @xmath85 so @xmath81 must be even .",
    "then @xmath86 if the news function @xmath81 is analytic , then the expansion close to the axis is indeed sufficient , provided that @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , since we have an extra suppression factor in  , we expect higher orders to become increasingly less important .",
    "the approximation used by death and payne  @xcite in @xmath2 , corresponds to an isotropy approximation so only @xmath88 is used in their result which give ( to second order in perturbation theory ) a result of @xmath89 .",
    "this is in agreement with the latest numerical relativity simulations of ultra - relativistic particle or black hole collisions at large boost  @xcite , so it seems to indicate that the angular corrections ( @xmath90 for @xmath91 ) are small in @xmath2 .",
    "[ section2 ]    in this section we shall analyze an example of shock wave collisions with an electric charge parameter .",
    "we will apply the formalism developed in the previous section while testing the assumptions of the formalism and commenting on its limitations .",
    "this example will make clear that the perturbative construction is only applicable if the bulk of the gravitational radiation is generated far away from the strongly curved region of space - time .",
    "the geometry of the @xmath0-dimensional reissner - nordstrm solution with mass @xmath92 and charge @xmath93 is @xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 it is intuitive , as first argued by pirani @xcite , that the gravitational field of a fast - moving mass should become increasingly similar to that of a gravitational plane - wave , as the speed is increased . for the case of a rn ` particle ' , the corresponding aichelburg - sexl shock wave is found by boosting this black hole and then taking simultaneously the limit of infinite boost @xmath96 and vanishing mass and charge , keeping fixed @xcite    @xmath97    the resulting geometry for a particle moving in the @xmath98 direction in brinkmann coordinates is @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "the function @xmath101 depends only on @xmath102 and takes the form @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104    the above coordinates are discontinuous at the shock . transforming to rosen coordinates @xmath105 @xcite , which are continuous at the shock ( see @xcite for the explicit transformation ) , the geometry for two oppositely directed shock waves , with equal charge parameter @xmath106 in , and equal energy @xmath107 may be written everywhere as a simple superposition of the two individual geometries , except in the future of the collision .",
    "moreover , in a boosted frame , moving with respect to the @xmath108 chart with velocity @xmath109 in the @xmath110 direction , the oppositely directed shock waves keep their form , but acquire new energy parameters , respectively , @xmath111 where @xmath112 . in this boosted frame ,",

    "to set up a perturbative computation and derive the geometry in the future light cone of the collision , we proceed as in @xcite . in the boosted frame one shock",
    "carries much more energy than the other and we thus face the weak shock ( traveling in the @xmath110 direction ) as a perturbation of the geometry of the strong shock ( traveling in the @xmath98 direction ) . the geometry of the latter is flat for @xmath115 ; thus we make a perturbative expansion of the einstein equations around flat space - time in this region .",
    "we shall make the perturbative expansion in brinkmann coordinates .",

    "thus , hereafter , @xmath118 and all coordinates are dimensionless .",

    "they jump to the collision surface ( green and brown lines ) .",
    "generically , the rays gain shear and : i ) for large @xmath127 ( green part of the curve ) focus along the caustic ( red line ) ; ii ) for small @xmath127 ( brown part of the curve ) diverge .",
    "undeflected rays are drawn in green . ]",
    "the step function in the previous equations jumps at the collision , which , in brinkmann coordinates , occurs at @xmath37 , @xmath128 . as the weak shock null generators ( traveling along @xmath129 ) reach the strong shock at @xmath37",
    "there is a discontinuity in brinkmann coordinates . to understand what occurs",
    ", we consider the trajectory of a weak shock null generator that , before the collision , obeys the parametric equations u()=  , v()=0  , ( ) =  .",
    "then , after the shock , its trajectory is given by @xcite u()=  , v ( ) = ( ) ( + )  , ( ) = ( 1- )  .",
    "indeed , the @xmath126 coordinate jumps from @xmath125 to the surface @xmath130 , i.e. the _ collision surface _ - fig .",

    "there were no extrema of this profile function .",
    "but in the charged case there is one maximum .",
    "the ray incident at the corresponding value of @xmath132 will follow a path of @xmath74 after the collision .",
    "this is possible for a null trajectory because such ray is _",
    "undeflected_. in general the rays are deflected by an angle @xmath133 in the @xmath134 plane , such that = ( 1- )  .",
    "it follows that the weak shock null generators become convergent ( towards the symmetry axis ) for @xmath135 , divergent for @xmath136 and there are undeflected generators for @xmath137 - fig .",
    "this is qualitatively very different from the uncharged case where all rays are convergent ( see fig . 4 in @xcite ) ; the divergent behaviour is caused by the repulsive gravitational effect of the charge .",
    "finally , for an observation point @xmath138 far from the collision and near the axis , fig . [ rays ] suggests four bursts of radiation , associated to the four optical paths that reach @xmath138 .",
    "the order in which the four rays should arrive at @xmath138 defines their numbering .",
    "the first ( second ) ray comes from the same ( opposite ) side of the axis as @xmath138 and from a low redshift region ( cf .",
    "[ lightcone ] ) .",
    "the third ( fourth ) ray comes from the same ( opposite ) side of the axis as @xmath138 and from a high redshift region .    .",
    "the introduction of charge leads to a divergent behaviour of the rays for @xmath136 and the existence of the undeflected rays ( green lines ) .",
    "moreover , amongst the convergent rays there is one family of maximal deflection ( dashed red and blue lines ) .",
    "the convergent rays will meet at the axis forming a caustic . for points outside the axis ,",
    "far away from the collision , such as point @xmath138 , the diagram suggests four radiation peaks associated to rays 1 - 4 .",
    "we shall see this interpretation matches the wave forms exhibited in section [ sec_num_rel ] .",

    "the limit described at the beginning of section [ dmetric ] also for the maxwell field , one computes that the energy momentum tensor associated to the shock with support at @xmath37 has a single non - vanishing component : t_uu=(u )  .",
    "[ bsource ] first observe that this energy - momentum tensor _ does not _ have support on @xmath24 .",
    "second , this energy - momentum tensor does not source the radiative components of the first order perturbation @xmath145 , since only the @xmath146 component is non - vanishing .",
    "finally , this energy - momentum tensor is completely taken into account already by the strong shock geometry , and hence by the initial conditions considered .",
    "indeed , the einstein tensor computed from ( [ aise ] ) reads g_uu=(u )  , which , of course , solves the einstein equations with the source ( [ bsource ] ) .",
    "as for the weak shock , it sources an energy momentum tensor with support on @xmath120 that , in principle , contributes to the radiative components via the first term in . in this paper we shall focus on the second term in , which suffices to demonstrate the difficulties in applying the perturbative method to shock waves with charge .",
    "a summary of the determination of the radiative scalar functions @xmath147 , is described in appendix  [ app : simplify ] .",
    "we can now discuss the domain for the time integration in ( [ epsilon ] ) .",
    "in the uncharged case , we observed in @xcite that both the beginning of the radiation burst and its peak , as observed at some space - time point @xmath138 in the future of the collision , could be understood by a simple ray analysis , similar to that displayed in figs .",
    "[ lightcone ] and [ rays ] , together with an analysis of the intersection of the past light - cone of @xmath138 with the collision surface .",
    "a similar reasoning for the charged case can be made .",
    "let @xmath138 have space - time coordinates @xmath34 , or , equivalently @xmath148 .",
    "one now observes that an observation point @xmath138 , specified by coordinates @xmath149 , close to the axis and far away from the collision is struck by four rays - fig .",
    "these arrive at retarded times @xmath150 , @xmath151 , where @xmath152 are determined by solving @xmath153 with @xmath154 , for @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , for @xmath158 and @xmath159 , simultaneously determining the auxiliary variable @xmath160 , which now ( unlike the uncharged case ) has two solutions for each of the two values of @xmath161 , reflecting the two rays coming from each side ( cf .",
    "[ rays ] ) .",
    "a qualitative difference with respect to the uncharged case is , however , that the past light cone of @xmath138 will have a non - vanishing intersection with the collision surface at _ all _ retarded times , corresponding to points very close to the axis .",

    "section [ section2 ] ) , the collision occurs at @xmath162 . in these ( continuous ) coordinates ,",
    "the future light cone of the collision has therefore two branches : @xmath163 and @xmath164 . in terms of the brinkmann coordinates these conditions read : u=0  ,   v >  , u>0  ,  v=+u  ,   where  = |(1 + )  .",
    "[ branches ] the second of these branches determines a surface which intersects the worldline of @xmath138 at the retarded times @xmath150 computed from ( [ retardedtimes ] ) .",

    "[ fig : redwfcharged ] , we display some wave forms for @xmath165 obtained from the numerical integration of the contributions in eqs .  , , and  .",
    "the integration was done using the numerical code developed in  @xcite .",
    "we have found two radiation signals as expected from the geometrical optics analysis .",
    "the left hand side plots , corresponding to the signal coming from rays 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ rays ] , coincide precisely with the wave forms computed without charge in  @xcite .",
    "the second signal ( right hand side plots ) , is associated to rays 3 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ rays ] ; these are the rays that are incident close to the axis . in a non - linear computation with horizon formation",
    ", a considerable part of this signal should be caught inside the black hole horizon , and should therefore be absent from the viewpoint of an asymptotic observer .",
    "the evidence that supports this statement comes from considering the apparent horizon . indeed , cutting off the @xmath166 integration region inside the exterior apparent horizon ( defined in @xcite )",
    ", the second burst of radiation ( between @xmath156 and @xmath159 ) vanishes .",
    "both re - scaled signals are actually independent of the charge parameter for large @xmath167 .",
    "this should not be suprising for rays that are incident far away from the center of the collision , since for large @xmath127 , the charge contribution to the gravitational field decays faster . however , the second ( anomalous ) re - scaled signal is also independent of the charge parameter so it gives a constant contribution when integrated in time , to @xmath168 . in particular",
    "this means that the result is discontinuous in the @xmath169 limit , as compared to the @xmath170 result .",
    "this is clearly related to the fact that the source is always repulsive for non - vanishing @xmath106 .",
    "we have extracted the two contributions to @xmath168 for large @xmath167 , and found that the contribution from the first wave form coincides ( within a numerical error of less that 1% ) with the @xmath170 computation .",
    "for @xmath171 we found @xmath172 and for @xmath173 , we found @xmath174 . if we add the contribution from the anomalous wave form signal , we get respectively @xmath175 and @xmath176 , independently of @xmath106 .    up to now we have focused on the even @xmath0 case .",
    "for @xmath0 odd , we expect the method to become even less meaningful since the green s function for odd @xmath0 has support not only on the past light cone , but also _ inside _ the past light cone . since the shock wave profile becomes repulsive at the center ( see fig .",
    "[ lightcone ] ) , we will get contributions to the integrals which come from highly deflected rays that went through the highly curved and non - linear region of spacetime .",
    "we should also mention that for @xmath2 , the integration of the wave form does not even converge for large @xmath167 to extract a finite @xmath168 .",
    "these results , altogether , indicate the break down of the perturbative method , and clarify its regime of validity . to summarise",
    ", the perturbative method should only capture the relevant physics whenever the optical rays arriving at the observation point go through weak field regions only @xcite .",
    "an ultra - relativistic particle collision is a highly dynamical process and also , if a black hole forms as a result , a strong field process .",
    "it is then quite remarkable if we may use a perturbative method , such as the one originally proposed in @xcite , to extract relevant physics , such as the inelasticity of the process .    a good way to test",
    "the method is to generalise it . in @xcite",
    "we have extended it to higher dimensions , revealing a remarkably simple pattern in first order perturbation theory .",
    "second order perturbation theory is then the next goal and , in this problem , one of particular importance . on the one hand",
    ", it will test if the simple pattern observed in @xcite is a special property of linear theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial data is exact in second order .",

    "firstly , including the charge parameter increases the value of @xmath9 , suggesting that a larger fraction of the energy is radiated away .",
    "intuitively , this may be associated to the fact that the charge term in the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole yields a repulsive effect .",
    "secondly , beyond a certain value of the charge parameter no apparent horizon can be seen .",
    "again , this is expected from the rn solution , which has a limit for the charge to mass ratio , beyond which no event horizon exists .",
    "thirdly , these results are independent of the relative sign of the initial charged particles that were infinitely boosted , in agreement with the observation that gravity is the dominant interaction in trans - planckian scattering @xcite .",
    "the observed behaviour using the perturbative method to first order shows a qualitative agreement with the first and third observations above .",
    "but , as emphasized already , the perturbative method lacks legitimacy in this problem , since there is a considerable amount of radiation that originates in the strong field region , where we have no reason to believe the method .",
