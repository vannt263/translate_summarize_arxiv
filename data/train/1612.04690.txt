    "fidelity@xcite is an information concept used to measure the similarity of an input and its corresponding output ( classical or quantum ) states of a channel . in quantum information theory ,",
    "the fidelity concept is hardly related to the size dependence because information science usually focuses on quantum states ( or information ) carried by few - body systems .",
    "therefore , none of previous works on the fidelity in information science , as far as we know , paid attention to the scaling behavior of the fidelity until recent application of fidelity in quantum phase transitions(qpts ) @xcite .    up to now",
    ", a lot of works @xcite connecting qpts and the fidelity have been done .",
    "traditionally , a qpt occurs when there is a significant change of the system s physical quantity .",
    "but of the quantum ground state concern , the fidelity measures the similarity between two quantum states differed by a certain fixed value of a driving parameter .",
    "when these two observations come together , the qpt can be observed as long as the fidelity drops to zero . it can be understood as the state of the system undergoes structural change from one phase to another , such that states from two phases are orthogonal to each other @xcite .",
    "such an interesting idea means the qpts can be characterized by solely the quantum state itself , without _ a priori _ knowledge to the symmetry and order of the system .",
    "since then , various fidelity - related measures have been put forward , including the fidelity per site @xcite , the fidelity susceptibility @xcite , thermal - state fidelity wlyou07fs , pzanardi07fs , pzanardi2007t , pzanardi062318,npaunkovic08,htquan2009 , operator fidelity @xcite , and density - functional fidelitysjgudff , which can be applied under different circumstances .",
    "remarkably , researches have been focusing on the scaling behavior of the above fidelity measures , as the second - order qpts occur only in the thermodynamics limit @xcite .",
    "while the idea of critical exponents in physical quantities has been well - established macontinentino , the above findings have also successfully related the critical exponent of the fidelity to those of the physical quantities , making the fidelity more physically meaningful",
    ".    however , it seems to us that the logarithmic fidelity , is presumably regarded an extensive quantity in relevant studies .",
    "such an idea is true for thermal state . as we will show below that the logarithmic fidelity of two thermal states is proportional to the helmholtz free energy , which is an extensive quantity for a thermodynamic system . while dramatically the logarithmic fidelity of two quantum states have distinct sizse dependence in different phases , which is believed to be caused by various quantum correlations . to explore the difference between the thermal - state logarithmic fidelity and the ground - state logarithmic fidelity is the key motivation of the present work .    in this paper , we show that the scaling dependence of the logarithmic fidelity may not always be universal for a thermodynamic system .",
    "the thermal - state logarithmic fidelity is extensive due to the extensibility of the helmholtz free energy .",
    "while the quantum ground - state logarithmic fidelity might be either intensive , extensive , or superextensive , depending on the quantum adiabatic dimension of the ground state .",
    "we take the anisotropic lipkin - meshkov - glick model ( lmg model ) @xcite as an example and show that the logarithmic fidelity scales like @xmath0 in the model s symmetry - broken phase and @xmath1 in the polarized phase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the definition of fidelity and logarithmic fidelity for both thermal state and quantum state , then explain why fidelity has different scaling behavior for both cases . in sec .",
    "iii , we take the lmg model as an example , and explicitly show that the logarithmic fidelity scales like @xmath0 in the symmetry broken phase and @xmath1 in the polarized phase . in sec .",
    "iv , we study numerically the critical properties of the fidelity per site around the transition point .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "let a quantum - many system be characterized by a pure state @xmath2 labeled the continuous variable @xmath3 . in describing a qpt ,",
    "the continuous variable is the driving parameter that induces the qpt , very often it is the interaction strength , or external field strength .",
    "the project between two states of different values of the variable @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be measured by the fidelity , which is defined as @xmath5 the fidelity is zero if two states are orthogonal , one if identical .    in ref .",
    "hqzhou07 , the authors proposed the logarithm of the fidelity , namely the fidelity per site to describe qpts .",
    "it is given by @xmath6 in which @xmath0 is the system size .",
    "usually , fidelity scale like @xmath7 for large scale @xmath0 .",
    "fidelity per site give a measurement of fidelity that is independent of the system size .",
    "the extension of fidelity to a mixed - state or matrix - product state makes use of the density matrix @xmath8 of the system , it is defined as @xmath9 if two mixed states are diagonal in the same set of basis , the fidelity is the trace of the product of the density matrices @xmath10 .",
    "such a definition allows description of classical phase transitions , as long as the thermal state of the system is obtained .    at finite temperatures ,",
    "a thermal state is described by the density matrix @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the inverse temperature , and the boltzmann constant @xmath13 is set to be one , @xmath14 is the partition function of the system , i.e. @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the energy eigenstate of the system s hamiltonian .",
    "the thermal - state fidelity in the parameter space of temperature ( and thus @xmath17 ) is of the form @xmath18 with different temperature @xmath19 .",
    "let us take the logarithm of the thermal - state fidelity , @xmath20notice that@xmath21 is the helmholtz free energy , which is an extensive quantity , thus logarithmic fidelity for thermal state should also be an extensive quantity .",
    "an other useful quantum quantity , the fidelity susceptibility @xmath22 was also be derived to be equal to @xmath23 @xcite , that is proportional to @xmath0 .    on the other hand , the quautum - state logarithmic fidelity leads by the fidelity susceptibility@xcite , @xmath24if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are close to each other .",
    "the ground - state fidelity susceptibility has its own quantum adiabatic dimension in different phases , while the thermal - state logarithmic is lead by extensive term .",
    "therefore , we speculate that the quautum - state logarithmic fidelity might not be always extensive . in the following section",
    ", we are going to use the anisotropic lmg model as an example to demonstrate the size dependence of logarithmic fidelity in both phases .",
    "the hamiltonian of the lmg model reads @xmath27where @xmath28 are the usual pauli matrices , @xmath29 the collective operator , @xmath30 denotes the anisotropy parameter , and @xmath3 is the external magnetic field . in its isotropic case @xmath31 , it undergoes a first order qpt ( ground state level crossing ) at @xmath32 . in our discussion",
    ", anisotropic case is concerned . in anisotropic case",
    "@xmath33 , a second order qpt at @xmath34 .",
    "the ground state of the system falls on @xmath35 .",
    "the lmg model can be used to describe the bose - einstein condensate and josephson junctions .",
    "the spectrum of the lmg model is recently reviewed by some sophisticated analytic method , including the continuous unitary transformation sdusuel05 and the spin coherent state formalism pribeiro07,pribeiro08 , these enriched the understanding of the model , and extended the study to a wide range of parameter values .",
    "to study the behavior of logarithmic fidelity of the lmg model , we are going to discuss the polarized phase and symmetry - broken phase seperately .      in polarized phase ,",
    "the usual treatment to obtain the solution of groundstate is by firstly , mapping the collective spin operator @xmath37 into bosonic operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 by holstein - primakoff transformation .",
    "then @xmath38 and @xmath39 are mapped into another pair of bosonic operator @xmath40 and @xmath41 by standard bogoliubov transformation .",
    "i.e ,    @xmath42    after adjusting the parameter @xmath43 , the hamiltonian is diagonalized to the following form while @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45    the eigenstates are @xmath46 , therefore the groundstate is @xmath47 .",
    "we are interested in the fidelity @xmath48        in fig .",
    "[ fig : hgone ] we show the behavior of logarithm of fidelity in the symmetry - broken phase ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "it shows clearly that logarithm of fidelity and the system is in linear relation .",
    "i.e , @xmath50such that @xmath51this observation means that the logarithmic fidelity is proportional to system size",
    ". however , in the polarized phase ( @xmath52 ) , we obtain that the logarithmic fidelity is of different dependence of system size .",
    "refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : hgone ] , it tells us that when @xmath0 is increased , the quantum logarithmic fidelity tends to a fix number .",
    "i.e , @xmath53as its independence of system size , it is meaningless to measure @xmath54 is this phase .",
    "its logarithmic fidelity always tends to zero while system size increases .",
    "alternatively , we then confirm difference @xmath0 dependence by applying analytical methods to obtain explicitly the fidelity and its logarithm of the lmg model . by mapping the hamiltonian into the bosonic operator and then diagonalizing it by standard bogoliubov transformation , the hamiltonian in the polarized phase ( @xmath52 ) becomes    @xmath55where the eigenstates are @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , we can start with the ground state @xmath58where the relation between @xmath38 and @xmath40 is given by bogoliubov transformation that@xmath59 where @xmath60 is a function of @xmath3 .",
    "it is possible to express the ground state as the combination of @xmath61 , which is the eigenstates of @xmath62,where @xmath63 , i.e , @xmath64where @xmath65 is the coefficient and it is then solved and normalized by @xmath66 .",
    "the result shows ,    @xmath67for @xmath68 , with @xmath69 = \\frac{1-\\gamma } { 2h-1-\\gamma } .\\]]the analytical form of fidelity between @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be obtain as @xmath70where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "fidelity here is an intensive value , by taking log , the quantum logarithmic fidelity is @xmath73\\left(1-\\tanh \\frac{\\theta } { 2}\\tanh \\frac{\\theta ^{\\prime } } { 2}\\right).}\\end{aligned}\\]]therefore , agreeing with the numerical result , the logarithmic fidelity is independent of the system size in the polarized phase . with the expression of fidelity",
    ", we recover the fidelity susceptibility in ref .",
    "@xcite that by taking the second derivative of fidelity between @xmath3 and @xmath74 with respect to @xmath75 for @xmath75 approaching @xmath76 .",
    "it gives the result of , @xmath77      in the following , we are going to derive the @xmath0 dependence of logarithmic fidelity for @xmath49 , in semi - classical treatment@xcite , the relation between the spin operator at @xmath79 and @xmath80 is given by        @xmath81where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 representing two different external field strength , @xmath86 for a large system , @xmath87 is approximated in holstein - primakoff representation that @xmath88 a_{1}+\\frac{1}{2}% \\left [ { \\cos ( \\alpha _ { 12})-1}\\right ] a_{1}^{\\dag }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sin ( \\alpha _ { 12})\\left ( { \\frac{n}{2}-a_{1}^{\\dagger } a_{1}}\\right ) ,    \\nonumber \\\\ a_{2}^{\\dagger } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ { \\cos ( \\alpha _ { 12})-1}\\right ] a_{1}+% \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ { \\cos ( \\alpha _ { 12})+1}\\right ] a_{1}^{\\dag }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sin ( \\alpha _ { 12})\\left ( { \\frac{n}{2}-a_{1}^{\\dag } a_{1}}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\]]where the @xmath89 and @xmath38 are bosonic creation and annihilation operators . by same approach as the @xmath52 case , expanding the ground state in terms of the eigenstate of @xmath90 . beware that both ground states at @xmath25 and @xmath26 should be expanded in same set of basis ( i.e. expand ground state at @xmath91 in terms of states at @xmath92 ) .",

    "now , we experienced in lmg model that , logarithm of fidelity is of different dependence of system size in two phases . in other words ,",
    "the .ogarithmic fidelity is extensive in broken phase but intensive in symmetric phase . as we obtained in the first page that the logarithm of fidelity in thermal states are always proportional to the system size",
    ", we believe that the non - universal system size dependence of logarithmic fidelity is a pure quantum effect .",
    "for various systems sizes . here the fixed point set at @xmath96 1.1.,width=321 ]     smaller than one . here the fixed point is set at @xmath96 1.1.,width=321 ]    it is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig3 ] that for setting the fixed point in the symmetry - broken phase , @xmath97 experiences the extensive behavior across @xmath3 .",
