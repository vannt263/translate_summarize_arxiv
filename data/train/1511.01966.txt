    "approximating a given matrix by a low - rank matrix is a fundamental problem in many signal processing applications @xcite .",
    "the low - rank matrix approximation ( lrma ) problem is a pivotal step in numerous machine learning @xcite , statistical signal processing @xcite , graph signal processing @xcite , and tensor recovery @xcite problems .",
    "we consider the problem of estimating a low - rank matrix @xmath0 from its noisy observation @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents zero - mean additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "we define the lrma problem as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the i@xmath7 singular value of the matrix @xmath0 , and @xmath8 is a sparsity - inducing regularizer , possibly non - convex .",
    "the standard nuclear norm minimization ( nnm ) problem @xcite is a special case of the lrma problem , with @xmath9 .",
    "note that the nnm problem is convex and its global minimum can be directly obtained using the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the input matrix @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath10 is the svd of @xmath1 , then the solution to the nnm problem is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the soft - threshold function @xcite applied to the singular values of @xmath1 .",
    "the solution to the nnm problem is known as ` singular value thresholding ' ( svt ) method @xcite .",
    "the svt method tends to underestimate the non - zero singular values .",
    "several recent studies have emphasized the benefit of non - convex penalty functions compared to the nuclear norm for the estimation of singular values @xcite .",
    "however , the use of non - convex penalty functions generally suffers from numerous issues ( spurious local minima , initialization issues , etc . ) .    in this letter",
    ", we aim to estimate the non - zero singular values more accurately than the nuclear norm , while maintaining convexity of the objective function . to this end",
    ", we propose to use a particular class of parameterized non - convex penalty functions .",
    "we show how to set the non - convex penalty parameter to ensure the proposed objective function is strictly convex .",
    "the idea of using non - convex penalty functions within a convex optimization framework was described by blake and zisserman @xcite and nikolova @xcite , and has been applied to various signal processing problems @xcite .",
    "several non - convex penalty functions have been utilized for the lrma problem : the weighted nuclear norm @xcite , transformed schatten-1 ( ts1 ) @xcite and the proximal p - norm @xcite .",
    "the use of these non - convex penalty functions makes the overall lrma problem non - convex . as such ,",
    "iterative algorithms aiming to reach a stationary point ( i.e. , not necessarily global optimum ) of the non - convex objective function have been developed @xcite .",
    "also , a non - iterative locally optimal solution for the lrma problem using the proximal p - norm is reported in @xcite .",
    "note that the proximal operators ( see sec .",
    "[ subsection::penalty functions ] ) associated with the ts1 penalty and the proximal p - norm are not continuous for all values of the regularization parameter @xmath13 . in contrast",
    ", the proposed approach always leads to a convex problem formulation .",
    "a broader class of non - convex penalty functions was studied for the lrma problem in @xcite .",
    "the iteratively reweighted nuclear norm minimization @xcite and generalized singular value thresholding @xcite methods provide a locally optimal solution to the lrma problem , provided that the penalty functions satisfy certain assumptions ( see assumption a1 of @xcite ) .",
