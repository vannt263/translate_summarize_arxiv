    "optical spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the energy spectrum of electronic states in low - dimensional heterostructures .",
    "it was successfully used for investigation of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) ( for review see e.g. ref .  ) , providing additional information not available from transport measurements alone . however , in optical experiments the presence of photoexcited holes perturbs the energy spectrum of the 2deg via electron - hole coulomb interactions , an effect which should be taken into account for proper interpretation of optical spectra .",
    "this is already the case for iii - v semiconductor heterostructures based on gaas , where the coulomb interaction is relatively weak ( e.g. the exciton binding energy in bulk gaas is 4.2  mev ) .",
    "however , coulomb interactions are of major importance for ii - vi semiconductors ( e.g. the exciton binding energy in bulk znse is 20  mev ) .",
    "modification of the optical spectra of modulation - doped quantum wells ( qw ) containing a 2deg has been the subject of extensive theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite .    in undoped qws ,",
    "the ground state of an optically excited single electron - hole pair is an exciton ( @xmath2 ) , which is formed by the coulomb interaction between the electron and the hole .",
    "for qws with a very dilute two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) where the electron concentration @xmath3 ( here @xmath4 is the radius of the quasi - two - dimensional exciton ) , a negatively charged exciton complex is the energetically lowest excitation @xcite .",
    "the negatively charged exciton is composed of two electrons and a hole , and is commonly called a trion ( @xmath5 ) , and is analogous to the negatively charged @xmath6 state of the hydrogen atom . in semiconductor qws trions have binding energies of a few mev and are observed in optical spectra below the exciton resonance . in the limit of zero electron concentration",
    ", the energy separation between trion and exciton optical transitions corresponds to the binding energy of `` isolated '' trions @xmath7 ( i.e. the trion state which is not perturbed by interaction with the 2deg ) .",
    "it varies usually from 5 to 20% of the exciton binding energy @xmath8 depending on the qw thickness and the height of the barriers ( see e.g. ref .   and references therein ) .    for a high density 2deg with @xmath9 , screening and phase space filling effects destroy the strong coulomb attraction between an individual electron and hole , i.e. the exciton is suppressed @xcite . as a result , instead of a narrow excitonic emission , a broad emission band with a linewidth determined by the 2deg fermi energy @xmath10 is characteristic of this regime .",
    "also , a fermi - edge singularity ( @xmath11 ) appears in optical spectra owing to the coulomb interaction of a photocreated hole with the electrons at the fermi - surface @xcite .",
    "optical spectra are usually interpreted in terms of band to band transitions , dressed with many - body interactions of the excited or annihilated electron - hole pair with electrons of the fermi sea @xcite .",
    "the energies of the emission and absorption thresholds are shifted following to a band - gap renormalization . extended numerical calculations are needed to model optical spectra of a qw with a dense 2deg .",
    "on the basis of such calculations hawrylak _ et al .",
    "_ predicted the presence of two thresholds ( two peaks ) in the absorption spectrum corresponding to the bound states of the photoexcited hole interacting with a 2deg .",
    "the first threshold occurs at an energy @xmath12 and is a doubly occupied trion complex .",
    "the second threshold with an energy @xmath13 corresponds to an exciton created in the 2deg @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to explain the main features in the optical spectra of modulation doped gaas qws @xcite .",
    "evolution of the optical spectra with increasing electron density from the low - density to the high - density limit is an important issue which has been examined experimentally in recent years for gaas [ 33 ] , cdte @xcite and znse @xcite based qws .",
    "general trends have been established and attempts to formulate a phenomenological description have been undertaken .",
    "it has been shown that for all studied material systems the filling factor @xmath14 separates landau - level - like behavior from an excitonic - like behavior in external magnetic fields . in high magnetic fields for @xmath15",
    "the broad emission band transforms into a narrow line that shifts diamagnetically , reminiscent of the trion line in low - doped samples . further field increase to @xmath16 revives one more line in optical spectra , which is excitonic like . in these fields ,",
    "optical spectra of moderately - doped and very weakly - doped qws look identical .",
    "despite the considerable progress in experiment the situation is still far from completely understood , in major part due to the absence of a proper model description of the intermediate concentration regime . in this regime with @xmath17 the fermi energy of the 2deg falls in the range between the trion and exciton binding energies @xmath18 , and the effect of the coulomb interaction on the optical spectra can be discussed in terms of comparing these three characteristic energies .",
    "znse - based qws exhibit very strong coulomb electron - hole interactions ( the exciton binding energy is twice as large as compared to cdte qws and four times larger than in gaas qws ) . the coulomb energy amounts to 30 - 40  mev . in earlier studies of n - type doped ( zn , cd)se / znse qws",
    "the well layers were made of ternary alloy ( zn , cd)se @xcite .",
    "this results in a considerable broadening of optical lines by alloy fluctuations which obscures fine details in the spectroscopic analysis .    in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive optical study of n - type modulation - doped znse/(zn , be , mg)se qws , with an aim to investigate the modification of optical spectra in structures with strong coulomb interactions , and at the intermediate electron densities satisfying the condition @xmath19 .",

    "the electron density of @xmath35  @xmath1 in # 1r sample corresponds to @xmath50  mev and , therefore , the binding energy of an `` isolated '' trion can be evaluated as @xmath51  mev .",
    "the light - hole exciton ( @xmath52 ) in the reflectivity spectrum of sample # 1r is shifted by 18.7  mev to higher energies with respect to the heavy - hole exciton ( @xmath2 ) due to strain and quantum confinement .",

    "as we will show here some of the qualitative predictions of the hawrylak s theory are valid to describe our experimental observations .",
    "namely , the theory predicts that the energy difference between two thresholds in absorption , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , corresponding to bound states , satisfies the equality @xmath61 @xcite .",

    "in most regards , they are similar to the first set described above .",
    "the main difference comes from the higher electron density of sample # 2d .",
    "the pl spectrum from the reference sample # 2r consists of an exciton line ( @xmath2 ) at 2.8178  ev and a trion line at 2.8131  mev with linewidths of 1.3  mev ( see fig .",

    "in contrast to # 1d , the singularity at the fundamental absorption edge @xmath55 of # 2d is smeared out in the ple spectrum and the half intensity point of the rising edge in the absorption ( ple ) is blue shifted by 3.6  mev with respect to the high energy side of the pl band .",
    "additionally , a weak absorption attributed to the @xmath58 is observable in the ple spectra 13  mev higher than the @xmath55 line energy . in reflectivity spectra ,",
    "the oscillator strength of both transitions is weak .",

    "the shape of the pl spectrum of the doped samples is typical for modulation - doped qws with high electron densities , where the optical transitions are interpreted as band - to - band transitions of free carriers ( see schema in fig .",
    "[ fig_iii ] ) . in this case , all electrons in a 2deg can recombine with photoexcited holes .",
    "it is commonly suggested that the momentum conservation selection rule for optical transition ( @xmath66 ) is partially relaxed due to scattering with the electrons of the 2deg , or to collective excitations of the fermi sea @xcite . as a result , indirect optical transitions with @xmath67 between the electrons of the conduction band and holes of the valence band contribute significantly to emission spectra .",
    "we will show below that despite the visual similarity in the shape of emission spectra , this simple interpretation is insufficient to describe the optical spectra in the intermediate concentration regime where @xmath68 .",
    "coulomb interactions and excitonic effects are of great importance in this regime .    the temperature dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_iii ] helps to clarify the origin of the pl band in the doped samples .",
    "it is seen that in sample # 2d the line shape varies strongly as the bath temperature is increased from 1.6 up to 66  k. with the temperature increase , the maximum becomes less pronounced and also a shoulder on the high energy side smears out and becomes indistinguishable for temperatures higher than 30  k. let us first concentrate of the shape of the high - energy tail of the emission band .",

    "[ fig_iv ] .",
    "the exciton resonance in the undoped sample # 1r shows no temperature broadening for @xmath72  k. significant temperature broadening of the exciton line is expected due to exciton scattering on lo - phonons , which becomes important only for temperatures exceeding 100  k. in contrast , the width of the reflectivity resonance of the doped sample # 1d increases linearly with temperature .",
    "the slope of this increase equals @xmath73 , which is expected for the fermi statistics of the 2deg in the vicinity of the fermi edge .",

    "<S> the optical properties of two - dimensional electron gases in znse/(zn , be)se and znse/(zn , be , mg)se modulation - doped quantum wells with electron densities up to @xmath0  @xmath1 were studied by photoluminescence , photoluminescence excitation and reflectivity in a temperature range between 1.6 and 70  k and in external magnetic fields up to 48  t. in these structures , the fermi energy of the two - dimensional electron gas falls in the range between the trion binding energy and the exciton binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> optical spectra in this regime are shown to be strongly influenced by the coulomb interaction between electrons and photoexcited holes . in high magnetic fields , when the filling factor of the two - dimensional electron gas becomes smaller than two , a change from landau - level - like spectra to exciton - like </S>",
    "<S> spectra occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to provide a phenomenological description of the evolution of optical spectra for quantum wells with strong coulomb interactions . </S>"
