    "ever since the first discovery of fast radio bursts ( frbs ) over a decade ago @xcite , there has been a great deal of interest in uncovering their origin .",
    "currently , only 17 frbs have been recorded , and a summary of their properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "hypotheses put forward for frbs range from supramassive neutron stars @xcite to gamma - ray bursts @xcite and stellar flares @xcite . regardless of their actual origin ,",
    "it is now widely accepted that most frbs are at cosmological distances @xcite , particularly owing to the recent localization of the repeating frb 121102 to a dwarf galaxy at a redshift of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the unusually high brightness temperature of frb sources at cosmological distances @xcite implies that their radio emission mechanism must be coherent as known to exist in pulsars or human - made radio transmitters . despite the diversity of explanations advanced for frbs ,",
    "the possibility that they may be of artificial origin has not been specifically investigated , apart from section v of @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we examine the possibility that frbs are artificial beams which have been set up as beacons , or for driving light sails .",
    "the idea that extraterrestrial civilizations may be using radio beams ( manifested as dispersed pulses ) is certainly not a new one , as it dates back to the pioneering paper by @xcite .",
    "this idea was extended by researchers engaged in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) , accounts of which can be found in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to traditional , radio - based seti , many other approaches have been advanced for detecting alien civilizations ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in section [ secconstraints ]",
    ", we show that the parameters required for generating artificial beams ( to possibly power light sails ) are compatible with frb constraints .",
    "we discuss the implications and predictions in section [ secimps ] , and summarize our conclusions in section [ secconc ] .",
    "we start by examining whether some of the major frb constraints are consistent with the assumption of artificial beams , and then explore the possibility that these beams may be used to power light sails .",
    "we begin by denoting the distance of the beam source from the earth by @xmath1 .",
    "one of the primary _ observable _ parameters for frbs is the dispersion measure ( dm ) , defined through a line - of - sight integral , @xmath2 of the mean number density of free electrons @xmath3 . ignoring contributions from the source , its host galaxy and the milky way",
    ", one may adopt the mean comoving electron density for the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , @xmath4 @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that the frb redshifts are @xmath5 , and drop the redshift factors in the context of our order - of - magnitude estimations .",
    "most sources in the frb catalog @xcite have dm values of order hundreds of @xmath6 pc . using equation ( [ dmexp ] )",
    ", the distance can be estimated as , @xmath7 this distance is also consistent with more accurate estimates @xcite .",
    "next , we suppose that the beam has an angular width @xmath8 and a radiated ( peak ) power @xmath9 . the beam angle is expressible as some factor @xmath10 times the minimum value set by the diffraction limit , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the frequency of the radiation , @xmath13 is the diameter of the beam emitter , and @xmath14 .",
    "the spectral flux density is given by , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spectral index needed for the relation @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the fraction of @xmath9 that is emitted as frb radiation ( radiative efficiency ) .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath19 and will use @xmath20 henceforth @xcite , which implies that the artificial beams are _ broadband_. this unorthodox assumption , which is contrary to current terrestrial engineering design , will be central to our analysis , and does represent a significant conceptual challenge as to why civilizations would opt for broadband emission .",
    "the mean spectrum of frbs is observed to be gaussian - shaped , centered on a frequency of a few ghz @xcite . while being consistent with an artificial origin , this spectral shape is puzzling for pulsar or magnetar - like sources which are expected to show power - law spectra .",
    "inverting equation ( [ specfluxdens ] ) yields , should be corrected to @xmath21 in that paper . ]",
    "@xmath22 where the value of @xmath13 was normalized to the size of a large rocky planet @xcite for reasons explained below .",
    "first , let us suppose that extraterrestrial civilizations adopt the strategy of harnessing stellar energy @xcite to power the beams , thereby leading to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the stellar irradiance , which should be close to the solar value @xmath25 in the habitable zone .",
    "the characteristic value of @xmath13 is found from ( [ specfluxdens ] ) and ( [ solpow ] ) by substituting the typical values for all other parameters .",
    "as the aperture efficiency is @xmath18 , a fraction @xmath26 would be dissipated , amounting to a power per unit area of @xmath27 at the base of the emitter .",
    "if we assume that this excess heat is radiated away thermally , we get @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the surface temperature of the beamer",
    ". if the value of @xmath29 is too high , structural damage may follow .",
    "hence , an upper bound on @xmath29 translates to a lower bound on @xmath13 .",
    "this leads us to @xmath30 and a comparison with ( [ power ] ) and ( [ solpow ] ) reveals that the same power estimate follows for @xmath31 cm .",
    "this represents the _ minimum _ aperture diameter that is required to keep the system running .",
    "note that the value of @xmath29 has been normalized to the boiling temperature of water , since it is widely used as a coolant in many beamer designs @xcite .",
    "thus , we have shown that the characteristic value of @xmath32 cm is obtained in two very different ways , from energetic and engineering requirements .",
    "this already constitutes a remarkable coincidence .",
    "it is rendered more unique because of a third coincidence - the value is about twice the diameter of the earth . in other words ,",
    "the beam emitter is an object akin to a planet ; more precisely , it lies fairly close to the boundary between super - earths and mini - neptunes @xcite .",
    "another possibility worth considering is that the emitter could have been fashioned along the lines of the stapledon - dyson sphere @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we assumed that : ( i ) the emission was broadband , ( ii ) stellar energy was used to power the beams , and ( iii ) water was used as a coolant .",
    "a subtle distinction is that ( i ) relies on advanced technological choices ( and underpinnings ) , whilst ( ii ) and ( iii ) are tantamount to statements about the availability and usefulness of raw materials .",
    "the preceding discussion concluded that some of the major observables for frbs are consistent with the idea that they may be manifestations of extragalactic beams .",
    "however , this still fails to answer the important question of why they would be extant .",
    "the first , and most immediate , possibility is that they serve the purpose of ` beacons ' , and are thus meant to broadcast the presence of alien civilizations .",
    "but , why would a civilization want to broadcast its presence ?",
    "in @xcite , a variety of motives were considered , many of them of a sociological origin , such as a call for help , a desire to proclaim their technological achievements , etc . although these possibilities can not ( and ought not ) be ruled out , there are some inherent difficulties .",
    "they rely on complex ( anthropocentric ) reasons to some degree , and are thus not easily testable .",
    "moreover , equation ( [ power ] ) demonstrates that a power of @xmath33 is required , representing a fairly high expenditure .",
    "hence , it seems rather implausible that this power would be expended on merely broadcasting a civilization s existence .",
    "instead , we consider the idea discussed in @xcite , further elaborated in @xcite and @xcite , that these beams may power light sails .",
    "suppose that a civilization wishes to construct a light sail capable of attaining relativistic speeds . in @xcite , it was argued that an efficient strategy for achieving the largest possible velocity for a limited acceleration value leads to @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the maximum velocity and acceleration respectively , whilst @xmath37 is the fresnel distance .",
    "the above expression takes advantage of the constant beam diameter in the near - field fresnel region ( with the sail size matching @xmath13 ) out to @xmath38 , where the beam enters the fraunhofer ( far - field ) regime and starts to diverge with an opening angle @xmath8 . in section [ sseccons ]",
    ", we argued that @xmath13 should be normalized in units of @xmath39 cm for a multitude of reasons ; this amounts to @xmath40 . using this value along with the characteristic values for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we arrive at @xmath41 having normalized the acceleration in the anthropic units of @xmath42 gee .",
    "remarkably , the above frequency coincides with characteristic value of @xmath42 ghz considered thus far , which implies that the beam frequency that is optimal for powering the light sail falls within the range of frb frequencies .",
    "thus , it seems somewhat reasonable to hypothesize that the beams can be used to power light sails , and the ensuing implications are explored next .",
    "next , we delve into some of the other consequences arising from our prior analysis .      hitherto , we have not discussed any of the temporal aspects of the beam .",
    "we begin by noting that frbs are detected as pulses with a duration @xmath43 that is typically milliseconds .",
    "suppose that the beam sweeps across the sky with an angular velocity @xmath44 that is related to @xmath43 @xcite via @xmath45 alternatively , we can introduce the time period @xmath46 , which can be determined from the above formula , and is given by @xmath47 thus , the beam has a characteristic angular velocity of @xmath48 rad / s , viz . a time period around one week .",
    "the derived sweep time of the beam direction reflects the spin or orbital motion of the beamer footprint relative to the receding sail ( which cause the direction of the beam to change relative to the observer ) .",
    "sweeping is likely to be operational during the relatively short acceleration and deceleration stages .",
    "the total beam power required for driving a sail of total mass @xmath49 and maximum acceleration @xmath36 can be easily computed , assuming that the reflectivity is perfect @xcite . @xmath50 and",
    "the same characteristic value of @xmath36 from ( [ frequency ] ) has been utilized .",
    "note that @xmath49 has been normalized by that particular amount to ensure that equation ( [ sailpow ] ) matches the other estimates , namely equations ( [ power ] ) , ( [ solpow ] ) and ( [ heatpow ] ) .",
    "this implies that the mass of the sail is approximately @xmath51 tons . in deriving this estimate",
    ", we have assumed a rough equipartition of the total mass between the sail and the payload , implying that the latter is also @xmath52 tons .",
    "if the payload s density is akin to that of the international space station , the dimensions must be of order @xmath53 meters .",
    "the mass is rather high by human standards ; most estimates for light sail propulsion are two orders of magnitude lower @xcite .",
    "this estimate is approximately equal to the early fission - based rockets considered in the literature , which posited a total weight of up to @xmath54 tons @xcite .",
    "thus , if the beam was indeed used to power a spaceship , the latter would possibly have to be very large - an `` interstellar ark '' or `` world ship '' of sorts , although their typical masses ( @xmath55 tons ) are much higher @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ distfrb ] ) and the dms listed in the frb catalog imply that the characteristic distance to frbs is of order a few comoving gpc @xcite and the survey volume is of order @xmath56 .",
    "since we know that there are @xmath57 habitable earth - size planets in our galaxy @xcite , and @xmath58 in the entire hubble volume @xcite , it is fair to assume that there are @xmath59 habitable earth - size planets within a volume @xmath60 gpc@xmath61 . of these",
    ", suppose that a fraction @xmath62 of these planets are broadcasting beams , manifested as frbs .",
    "next , note that the characteristic beam solid angle is @xmath63 steradians , based on the characteristic parameters from the previous sections and equation ( [ angusize ] ) . since the sky is comprised of @xmath64 steradians , and there are @xmath65 broadcasting planets , at any given point in time @xmath66 beams are visible .",
    "each beam is visible for @xmath67 ms , which implies that approximately @xmath68 beams should be visible in a day .",
    "the latest estimates suggest that there are @xmath69 frbs per day @xcite .",
    "if we posit that not _ every _ frb arises from extragalactic civilizations , then we find , @xmath70    since we know , by definition , that @xmath14 , we arrive at the conclusion that @xmath71 .",
    "if each civilization broadcasts only a single beam , this allows us to place a bound on the number of technologically sophisticated civilizations . using this value of @xmath62 in conjunction with the fact that there are @xmath57 habitable earth - size planets in our galaxy leads us to the conclusion that there are less than @xmath72 frb - producing civilizations in a galaxy similar to our own .",
    "these civilizations must belong to the kardashev i class @xcite at the minimum , as seen from the characteristic power required in equation ( [ power ] ) .",
    "although this number is undoubtedly on the higher side , it is consistent with the earlier , more optimistic studies involving the famous drake equation @xcite ; some of the current theories have also yielded similar values @xcite .",
    "we reiterate that the above value is an _",
    "upper bound_. there exist at least three factors which can lower it :    * it is possible that the beam angle is not diffraction limited . even a fairly modest choice of @xmath73 can lower the value of @xmath74 by an order of magnitude , as evident from ( [ intlifefrac ] ) . *",
    "not all frbs have an artificial origin - only a fraction of them could correspond to alien activity . as an example , one may need to single out only those frbs that repeat , such as frb 121102 @xcite . * a civilization can set up more than one beam emitter .",
    "although it may seem unlikely , this could very well happen if a civilization has progressed to the kardashev ii or iii stages .",
    "an interesting corollary also follows : since we have assumed that frbs are of planetary origin , the rate of frbs is therefore set by the number of planets with advanced civilizations .",
    "this is in contrast to other models of frbs , such as gamma - ray bursts @xcite , whose occurrence rate is determined by the formation rate of massive stars .",
    "the power ` leakage ' from the light sails would be high , comparable to the beam power , because of broadband emission since the diffraction limit is different for each frequency , unlike the idealized case of monochromatic emission studied in @xcite",
    ".    it should be possible to distinguish between frbs of natural and artificial ( light sail ) origin based on the expected shape of the pulse , as the beam sweeps by to power the light sail @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the sail would cast a moving shadow on the observed beam , thereby leading to a diffraction pattern and multiple peaks in the light curve based on the sail geometry @xcite .",
    "a series of short symmetric bursts would be observed as the beam s path intersects with the observer s line of sight @xcite .",
    "hence , looking for similar signatures in the signal could help determine whether frbs are powered by extragalactic civilizations ( although the use of a broad range of frequencies might smear these signals ) .",
    "we suggest that initiatives such as breakthrough listen could be first directed towards the repeating frb 121102 @xcite .",
    "this proposition is reasonable since astrophysical explosions tend to produce single bursts , while artificial beacons can repeat .      in our analysis",
    "thus far , we have explicitly worked with parameters that were characteristic of frbs , such as @xmath75 jy .",
    "if all other quantities were held fixed in equation ( [ specfluxdens ] ) except for the power which is lowered significantly , @xmath76 would be much smaller .",
    "if the beam is assumed to power a light sail , equation ( [ sailpow ] ) implies that the light sail s mass or its maximum acceleration should be reduced to lower the power . in turn",
    ", this implies that the spacecraft would not be capable of interstellar travel on short timescales ; instead , it would be more likely to operate over _ interplanetary _ distances .",
    "hence , there may be a large number of interplanetary spacecrafts operating at extragalactic distances that are too faint to be detected .",
    "in contrast , such spacecrafts ( and beams ) _ within _ our galaxy are potentially detectable @xcite .",
    "finally , we end our discussion with an interesting observation .",
    "there are approximately @xmath77 @xmath78 galaxies within @xmath53 gpc@xmath61 , and approximately @xmath72 frbs per day , as discussed in section [ ssecfermip ] .",
    "thus , each galaxy has a probability of @xmath48 frbs / day .",
    "hence , an frb emanating from our own galaxy can be detected every @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "a galactic frb at a distance of @xmath80-@xmath81 kpc would be truly spectacular since the expected value of @xmath76 would be @xmath82-@xmath83 jy , and are detectable by low - cost radio receivers @xcite .",
    "this striking event could reveal everything that can be known about the true origin of frbs , and thereby settle this frb origin debate once and for all .",
    "in this letter , we have posited that fast radio bursts are beams set up by extragalactic civilizations to potentially power light sails .    in section [ secconstraints ]",
    ", we showed that the frb parameters were consistent with the assumption that they are artificial beams .",
    "we also demonstrated that there existed a ` natural ' size for the emitter which was approximately twice the diameter of the earth .",
    "this value was obtained by adopting two contrasting estimates - the first from energy considerations , whilst the second followed from engineering constraints .",
    "subsequently , we illustrated that the frequency needed to power the light sail was consistent with those observed for frbs , lending further credence to our hypothesis .",
    "our analysis gave rise to many interesting consequences .",
    "it was shown that the payload of the light sail and the beam s characteristic period should be approximately @xmath84 tons and @xmath85 days respectively . moreover , under certain simplifying assumptions , we derived an upper bound on the total number of intelligent civilizations in a galaxy ( akin to the milky way ) .",
    "we also suggested that smaller light sails may be widely prevalent , which are presently undetectable as their spectral flux densities are too low . using the all sky cosmological rate of frbs",
    ", we argued that an frb might originate within the milky way once every several centuries .    although the possibility that frbs are produced by extragalactic civilizations is more speculative than an astrophysical origin , quantifying the requirements necessary for an artificial origin serves , at the very least , the important purpose of enabling astronomers to rule it out with future data .",
    "we thank james benford , james guillochon , jonathan katz , zac manchester , dani maoz , andrew siemion , jason wright and the referees for helpful comments .",
    "this work was partially supported by a grant from the breakthrough prize foundation for the starshot initiative ."
