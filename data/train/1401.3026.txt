    "the joint spectral radius of a set of matrices , originally introduced in the short note  @xcite , is a natural extension of the spectral radius of a single matrix and has found various applications in , for example , wavelet theory , functional analysis , and systems and control theory ( see the monograph @xcite for detail ) .",
    "this wide range of applications has motivated many authors to study the computation of joint spectral radius .",
    "though even the approximation of joint spectral radius is in general an np - hard problem  @xcite , there are now a vast amount of efficient methods for the approximation of joint spectral radius @xcite and also their implementations on mathematical softwares  .",
    "the result @xcite by blondel and nesterov is of a particular theoretical interest because it characterizes joint spectral radius as the limit of another joint spectral characteristics called @xmath2-norm joint spectral radius when @xmath0 tends to @xmath1 .",
    "given a finite set  @xmath3 of real and square matrices of a fixed dimension and a parameter  @xmath4 , the _ @xmath2-norm joint spectral radius _ ( _ @xmath0-radius _ for short ) of @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes any matrix norm .",
    "firstly introduced  @xcite for @xmath8 and then extended  @xcite for a general @xmath0 , @xmath2-norm joint spectral radius has found many applications in various areas of applied mathematics ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular",
    "@xmath0-radius has an application to the stability theory of stochastic switched systems  @xcite , which is a dynamical system whose structure randomly experiences abrupt changes  @xcite .",
    "recently this `` original '' version of @xmath2-norm joint spectral radius was extended to probability distributions  @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the extension makes it possible to consider the @xmath0-radius of and is useful when , for example , one wants to study the stability of a stochastic switched system with infinitely many subsystems that naturally arise as a result of uncertainty in modeling of dynamical systems .",
    "being an extension , the @xmath0-radius of distributions inherits  @xcite from the @xmath0-radius of sets of matrices the characterization  @xcite as the spectral radius of a matrix . though the characterization is valid only either when @xmath0 is an even integer or when matrices in  @xmath5 leave a common proper cone invariant , it still covers several interesting cases that appear in the stability analysis of stochastic switched linear systems .",
    "then it is natural to expect that the other properties of the @xmath0-radius of sets of matrices can be extended to the @xmath0-radius of distributions .    in this paper",
    "we show that the characterization by blondel and nesterov  @xcite is still valid when we use the @xmath0-radius of probability distributions .",
    "this extension in particular circumvents the finiteness limitation of the original characterization .",
    "since the proof for the original result relies on the finiteness of the number of matrices , it can not be directly applied to the current setting .",

    "we will present a novel characterization of the stability of a switched linear system for an arbitrary switching signal with a so - called stochastic lyapunov function  @xcite , which is a positive definite functional whose value decreases along the trajectory of the switched linear system in expectation .",
    "the characterization in particular deduces the existence of stochastic lyapunov functions from stability and hence is a variant of the converse lyapunov theorems  @xcite in systems and control theory .",
