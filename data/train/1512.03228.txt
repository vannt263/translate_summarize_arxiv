    "we quickly check that the constant function @xmath46 is invariant , and wonder if there are any other invariant functions beyond the scalar multiples of @xmath47 .",
    "to analyze the situation , fourier analysis comes very handy .",
    "we expand the function @xmath39 in a fourier series @xmath48 which actually need not converge pointwise , but this does not bother us . the fourier series associated with @xmath49 is then @xmath50 and , by iteration , @xmath51 if @xmath52 solves the more general eigenvalue problem @xmath53 for some complex nonzero scalar @xmath54 , then we see by equating fourier coefficients that we must have @xmath55 for @xmath56 . by plugging in @xmath57 , we derive from the above equation that @xmath58 is the only possibility , provided that @xmath59 . moreover , for @xmath60 , we know from the riemann - lebesgue lemma that @xmath61 which lets us to conclude from that @xmath62 provided that @xmath63 . in this case",
    ", @xmath52 is of course constant , and if the constant is nonzero , then we also know that @xmath58 . in particular , the only invariant functions in @xmath64 are the constants .",
    "this observation is an equivalent reformulation of the well - known ergodicity of the doubling map with respect to the uniform measure on the interval @xmath65 ( see below ) .",
    "observation : as we look back at the argument just presented , we realize that we did not use all that much about the function @xmath52 , just that the conclusion of the riemann - lebesgue lemma holds . so in principle",
    ", we could replace @xmath52 by a finite borel measure , and obtain the same conclusion , if the fourier coefficients of the measure tend to @xmath21 at infinity .",
    "such measures are known as _ rajchman measures _ , and have been studied in depth in harmonic analysis .",
    "but the point of view we want to present here goes beyond that setting .",
    "_ we are in fact at liberty to replace @xmath52 by a distribution with a periodic extension _ , so that it has a fourier series expansion , and so long as its fourier coefficients @xmath66 tend to @xmath21 as @xmath67 , the argument works , and tells us that the constants are the unique @xmath41-invariant elements of this much wider space of distributions .",
    "such periodic distributions @xmath52 which fourier coefficients @xmath66 which tend to @xmath21 as @xmath67 deserve to be called _ rajchman pseudomeasures _ ( cf .",
    "this uniqueness within the rajchman pseudomeasures can be understood as _",
    "an extension of standard ergodic theory for the doubling map with respect to the constant density @xmath20_. indeed , an easy argument shows that the following are equivalent , for an invariant probability measure @xmath68 :    \\(i ) @xmath68 is ergodic , and    \\(ii ) whenever @xmath69 is a finite ( signed ) invariant measure , absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath68 , then @xmath69 is a scalar multiple of @xmath68 .",
    "this is probably well - known . for completeness , we supply the relevant argument .",
    "note first that we may restrict to real measures and real scalars in ( ii ) .",
    "the implication ( i)@xmath70(ii ) is pretty standard and runs as follows . by replacing @xmath69 by the sum of @xmath69 and an appropriate scalar multiple of @xmath68 , we reduce to the case when @xmath69 has signed mass @xmath21 .",
    "then , unless @xmath71 , we split @xmath69 into positive and negative parts , which are seen to be left invariant by the transfer operator , as otherwise the transfer operator applied to @xmath69 would have smaller total variation than @xmath69 itself .",
    "but then the support ( or rather , carrier ) sets for the positive and negative parts are necessarily invariant under the transformation , in violation of the ergodic assumption ( i ) , and the only remaining alternative is that @xmath71 , i.e. , the assertion ( ii ) holds .",
    "the remaining implication ( ii)@xmath70(i ) is even simpler .",
    "we prove the contrapositive implication , and assume that ( i ) fails , so that @xmath68 is not ergodic .",
    "then @xmath68 is not an extreme point in the convex body of all invariant probability measures , and hence it splits as a nontrivial convex combination of two invariant probability measures .",
    "both measures are assumed different than @xmath68 itself , and each one is obviously absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath68 , which shows that ( ii ) fails as well .",
    "it was the fact that the doubling map is piecewise affine that made it amenable to methods from fourier analysis .",
    "this is not the case for the gauss - type map @xmath72 acting on the symmetric interval @xmath73\\!-\\!1,1[$ ] , defined in the following fashion .",
    "first , we let @xmath74 denote the _ even - fractional part of @xmath75 _ , by which we mean the unique number in the half - open interval @xmath76\\!-\\!1,1]$ ] with @xmath77 . the gauss - type map @xmath78 is given by the expression @xmath79 here and in the sequel , _",
    "@xmath1 is assumed real with @xmath14_. the basic properties of @xmath72 are well - known , see , e.g. @xcite . we outline the basic aspects below , which are mainly based on the work of thaler @xcite and lin @xcite . for @xmath28 , the set @xmath80 acts as an _ attractor _ for the iterates under @xmath72 , and inside the attractor @xmath80 , the orbits form @xmath81-cycles . here",

    "on the other hand , we are in the setting of infinite ergodic theory , where @xmath10 is the ergodic invariant measure .",
    "the reason is that the endpoint @xmath20 ( which for all essential purposes may be identified with the left - hand endpoint @xmath84 for the dynamics ) is only weakly repelling .",

    "the behavior of @xmath72 is rather uninteresting on the attractor @xmath80 , and for this reason , we introduce the _ subtransfer operator _ @xmath95 which discardsthe point masses from the attractor . in other words , we put @xmath96 in more direct terms , this is the same as @xmath97 which we see from . here , @xmath98 , as before .",

    "the formula for the operator @xmath95 remains valid .",
