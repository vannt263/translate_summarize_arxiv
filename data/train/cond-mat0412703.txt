    "recent research shows that most communications networks , like the world wide web , the internet , telephone networks , transportation systems ( including the power distribution network ) , and biological and social networks , belong to a class of networks known as small - world scale - free networks . these networks exhibit both strong local clustering ( nodes have many mutual neighbors ) and a small diameter ( maximum distance between any two nodes )  @xcite .",
    "another important common characteristic is that the number of links attached to the nodes usually obeys a power law distribution ( is scale - free ) as was observed first in empirical studies from the faloutsos brothers @xcite and barbasi and albert @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present data that show that the eigenvalue distribution of the adjacency matrix of the internet graph also follows a power law .",
    "a qualitative proof that this power - law is a consequence from the distribution of degrees of the network , which should contain many star subgraphs of different sizes , was presented by the authors in @xcite .",
    "mihail and papadimitriou in  @xcite provided an analytical proof by using the theory of random graphs .",
    "fabrikant , koutsoupias and papadimitriou  @xcite provide an explanation of the internet power laws based on complex multicriterion optimization .",
    "many approaches to understanding small - world scale - free networks are based on stochastic models and computer simulations , however the use of deterministic models ( although they do not allow to capture the full complexity of a real life network ) do help in the understanding of their behavior and permit the direct determination of relevant parameters for the modeled networks . in particular , it is possible to construct small - world deterministic graphs with different degree distributions matching the distribution of real networks , see  @xcite .",
    "we introduce in this paper a simple deterministic model , a toy model , to show analytically , that the observed eigenvalue power law of the internet may be a direct consequence of the degree distribution of a star based structure ( whose power law can be justified considering , for example , preferential attachment  @xcite or duplication  @xcite models ) .",
    "restricting our study to the internet graph ( at the router level ) , our model considers this graph as a scale - free network made by the union of a number of star graphs with different orders and connected through the root vertices by a relatively small backbone graph @xmath0 , see figure 1 .     to form graph @xmath1 .",
    "( b ) deleting the backbone graph @xmath0 results in a non connected graph constituted by the union of star graphs.,width=302 ]    this model is an approximation to the real internet graph , as described in appendix a of @xcite , if we consider a degree distribution matching the observed results :    each @xmath2-star graph ( with a root node and @xmath3 other nodes ) will contribute with a vertex of degree @xmath3 and @xmath3 vertices of degree @xmath4 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this star graph are @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "if we consider a set of star graphs whose root vertices have rank degrees distributed according to a power law @xmath7 , the graph union of these graphs will have eigenvalues with ranks distributed according to @xmath8 .",
    "we note that , as we are considering a determinitic exact model , to relate the exponent of the discrete degree distribution to the @xmath7 exponent of a continuous degree distribution for a random scale - free graph , a cumulative distribution should be considered , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are values of the discrete degree spectrum , @xmath12 is the number of vertices of degree @xmath11 and @xmath13 is the order of the graph .",
    "it is possible now to give some insight on the eigenvalues of the global graph @xmath1 obtained by joining the star graphs by using a backbone graph @xmath0 .",
    "since the number of vertices of @xmath0 is small with respect to the total number of vertices of all the star graphs , the values of the spectrum will be very close to the original graph of stars and will therefore follow a power law .",
    "this last result is related to the interlacing theorem  @xcite which states that if @xmath14 is a graph with spectrum @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a vertex of @xmath14 , and @xmath17 is the spectrum of @xmath18 ( the graph resulting from @xmath14 after deleting @xmath16 and its associated edges ) then the spectrum of @xmath18 is interlaced with the spectrum of @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath19 .    on the other hand , notice that this simple model ensures that if the power - law exponent for the degrees is @xmath7 , the corresponding exponent for graph @xmath1 will be approximately @xmath20 , matching the results shown in  @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we compute analitically the eigenvalues of @xmath1 and verify that they are close to those of its star subgraphs .",
    "consider @xmath21 star graphs @xmath22 with , respectively , @xmath23 vertices .",
    "the backbone graph @xmath0 joins the central vertices of each star .",
    "we call @xmath24 the adjacency matrix of this graph @xmath0 .",
    "this is equivalent to start with a graph @xmath0 with @xmath21 vertices and add to each vertex , respectively , @xmath25 new vertices of degree 1 .    to compute the spectrum of the global graph @xmath1 ( @xmath0 plus the vertices of degree one ) we consider @xmath26 which gives the system to solve @xmath27 where @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath3 ones ,",
    "i.e. @xmath30 is a @xmath31 matrix and @xmath32 is the null matrix with dimensions @xmath33 .    if @xmath34 , from ( [ eq : sistema ] ) we obtain @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a diagonal matrix , whose elements are @xmath25 .",
    "thence @xmath37 . introducing @xmath38 , this last equation can be written @xmath39 if the backbone graph @xmath0 is another star graph with @xmath21 nodes ( rooted in one of the star graphs ) , then the matrix @xmath24 will be @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a null matrix of dimensions @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues of @xmath1 are the values of @xmath44 wich verify ( [ eq : tosolve ] ) for this @xmath24 , i.e. values which allow the matrix @xmath45 to have 1 as eigenvalue .    solving @xmath46 we find @xmath47 and the eigenvalues are @xmath6 with multiplicity @xmath48 , and @xmath49 with multiplicity @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the final equation to solve is @xmath50 its left part is a function of @xmath44 @xmath51 and it can be decomposed in a sum of simple fractions whose asymptotes are given by @xmath52 .",
    "the points @xmath53 where this rational function cuts the constant function @xmath4 are the solutions of the equation , and they are therefore the eigenvalues of @xmath1 we are looking for , see figure  2 .    , the graph obtained by joining several star graphs with a backbone graph.,width=453 ]    each fraction @xmath54 can be decomposed as @xmath55 . if we consider the positive values to find the largest eigenvalues and assuming @xmath56 , for @xmath57 approaching the value @xmath58 from the right , the function @xmath59 is negative , whereas approaching it from the left it is positive .",
    "therefore it should cut the constant function @xmath4 in the left side , so @xmath60 , and @xmath61 as at @xmath62 there is another asymptote and the function is negative on the right side of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore the eigenvalues of @xmath1 verify : @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 . at @xmath66",
    "the function is positive at the right of this point and negative at the left .",
    "hence , @xmath67 .",
    "note that if the values for @xmath3 are consecutive integers , the difference in the corresponding square roots will be very small for large @xmath3 and the eigenvalues for the new graph will be very near to those of the disconnected star graphs .    consider the oregon - multi dataset of internet at the as level as in 2001  @xcite , and use a star graph as backbone graph @xmath0 to interconnect the star graphs with @xmath3 equal to 1400 , 1000 , 900 , 625 , 575 , 550 , 515 , 425 , 415 , 350 , 340 , 320 , 285 , 250 , 225 , 215 , 210 , 180 , 175 and 170 .",
    "the degree distribution ( by construction ) fits the degree distribution of the internet graph as shown in  @xcite . to calculate the spectra of this graph we solve the equation @xmath68 and we obtain : 13.03 , 13.22 , 13.41 , 14.48 , 14.66 , 14.99 , 15.81 , 16.87 , 17.88 , 18.43 , 18.70 , 20.36 , 20.61 , 22.68 , 23.44 , 23.96 , 24.98 , 29.97 , 31.59 , 37.80 . in figure 3",
    "we plot the twenty highest eigenvalues in a log - log scale .",
    "the result shows a power law as in the real data from  @xcite .",
    "observe that the slope of the regression model is very similar to the observational data .",
    "the model considered here describes the degree and eigenvalue distributions of the internet graph , however its clustering is zero as the resulting graph is a tree .",
    "we have performed the same analysis connecting the root vertices of the star graphs with a complete graph .",
    "the results are comparable to those obtained above ( in that case the clustering of the global graph is different from zero but small ) .",
    "we note that if the backbone graph @xmath0 joins complete graphs instead of star graphs this would lead to an eigenvalue power law with an exponent close to the exponent of the degree distribution ( the eigenvalues of a complete graph with @xmath69 vertices are @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "the star - based model considered here constitutes a convenient tool to study the internet network since using deterministic techniques no simulation is needed and relevant network parameters can be directly calculated .",
    "thus , the contrast of real with synthesized networks is straightforward . on the other hand",
    ", our study shows that it is a reasonable assumption to consider that the internet graph contains many star subgraphs , as this explains the observed power - laws and relationship between the degree and eigenvalue distributions .",
