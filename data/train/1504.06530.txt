    "the emission line intensity mapping is a technique to access high-@xmath12 galaxies below the detection limit without losing redshift information , as proposed by e.g. @xcite .",
    "optimistically , it only collects radiation from galaxies in a selected redshift range , as the spurious flux due to foregrounds , contaminating radiation and noise can be in principle removed or suppressed .",
    "compared with galaxy surveys that aim at resolving faint spots in a limited field of view ( fov ) , the advantages of intensity mapping rely on the fact that , if the galaxy luminosity function has a sufficiently steep faint end , the observed radiation is actually dominated by unresolved sources @xcite . even if this is not the case , intensity mapping can still be used to study unresolved galaxies once resolved sources are removed ( masked ) .",
    "interestingly , an intensity mapping experiment could be carried out with a modest aperture but large fov telescope .",
    "the [ ] 157.7  @xmath13 m fine - structure line arising from the @xmath14p@xmath15@xmath16@xmath14p@xmath17 transition is the brightest amongst all metal lines emitted by the interstellar medium ( ism ) of star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is associated to the star formation in galaxies and plays a key role in the energy balance of galaxies , as it provides one of the most efficient cooling processes for the neutral ism .",
    "with respect to the ly@xmath18 line , the [ ] line has the advantage of being unaffected by dust attenuation and neutral hydrogen absorption .    in the local universe , [ ]",
    "line has been successfully detected even in galaxies with amazingly low star formation rates ( sfr ) of @xmath19yr@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these authors have also derived the relation between the [ ] line luminosity , @xmath20 , and the sfr of _ local _ galaxy samples @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , given the rather complicated physics behind the [ ] emission , @xmath20 scales rather tightly with sfr .",
    "however , at high redshift ( @xmath21 ) , the [ ] line has been detected so far only in quasar host galaxies or ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , with @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the in - band luminosity at @xmath24 m ) characterized by sfr @xmath25yr@xmath6 . for typical normal star - forming galaxies ( sfr @xmath26yr@xmath6 ) , [ ] emission",
    "has not yet been detected @xcite .",
    "this might indicate that most of carbon in these galaxies is at higher ionization state and/or their ism is characterized by a very low level of metal enrichment . by applying the @xmath27sfr relation derived from local galaxies samples to high redshift ly@xmath18 emitters it is possible to compute the expected [ ] flux from these galaxies .",
    "the fact that their [ ] line remains undetected even with alma provides useful constraints on their internal radiation field , molecular content , gas density , and metallicity @xcite .    as probing tools ,",
    "intensity mapping experiments are affected by the presence of foreground radiation , including that represented by the galaxy continuum redshifted into the observed band .",
    "unfortunately , it is almost often the case that the foreground intensity largely exceeds that of the signal . the typical [ ]",
    "line luminosity is @xmath28 of the @xmath23 .",
    "this implies that even if only one percent of the ir luminosity is redshifted into the observed band , the continuum emission overcomes the [ ] line .",
    "in addition to the far - infrared ( fir ) continuum foreground , there are other emission lines emitted from a range of redshifts that fall at the same frequency of the [ ] signal ; they act as _ contaminants_. for example , the [ ] line with wavelength 145  @xmath13 m , the two [ ] lines ( @xmath29 m ) and two [ ] lines ( @xmath30 m ) , and a handful of co rotational transition lines in the range 200 - 2610 @xmath13 m . among these ,",
    "the co rotational transition lines are the most relevant here .",
    "for example , since the co(4 - 3 ) line has a wavelength @xmath31 , if emitted from @xmath32 galaxies , it contaminates the [ ] emission from @xmath33 galaxies .",
    "the emission efficiency of the co(4 - 3 ) line from star - forming galaxies is @xmath34 of the [ ] line @xcite .",
    "however , the luminosity distance from @xmath35 to 0.45 is only @xmath36 of that to @xmath37 . as the flux is inversely proportional to the square of the luminosity distance , whereas the proper distance interval that corresponds to the same bandwidth is @xmath38 , the co flux can be more than ten times higher than the [ ] one , even ignoring the cosmological evolution of the star formation rate density .",
    "thus , co contamination , as well as the continuum foreground , can not be ignored and must be considered thoroughly .",
    "although the [ ] signal itself can be computed analytically @xcite , a reliable investigation of the influence of foreground / contamination is only possible based on mock maps that carefully mimic observations as close as possible .",
    "this is the prime motivation of this paper . using halo catalogs recovered from large scale n - body simulations , we produce mock maps including ( a ) [ ] signal , ( b ) fir continuum foreground , ( c ) co and [ ] contamination lines , and ( d ) instrumental noise . we then test our foreground / contamination removal scheme on these maps to demonstrate the successful recovery of the original [ ] signal .",

    "[ method ] , we describe the model used to compute the [ ] from high-@xmath12 galaxies and the necessary steps to generate mock maps .",

    "we have studied the collective [ ] emission signal from star - forming galaxies at @xmath209 , as well as the influence of fir continuum foreground and co and [ ] contamination on the experimental detection of the signal .",
    "to this aim we have combined the predicted [ ] line luminosity as a function of the galaxy star formation rate and metallicity ( derived from single galaxy simulations including a sub - grid treatment of the interstellar medium presented in v15 ) with a semi - empirical approach to compute the @xmath44 relation .",
    "this relation is subsequently applied to halo catalogs built from the large - scale n - body simulation bolshoip , to generate mock maps of [ ] signal .    to compute the fir continuum foreground , we derived the @xmath121 relation via the abundance - matching technique .",
    "as for the contamination by co lines emitted from low - redshift galaxies , instead of using the poorly constrained co luminosity functions , we use intermediate @xmath210 relations that were better fitted from measurements of both local and high - redshift samples .",
    "we use the theoretical calculations of the [ ] line luminosities as a function of @xmath23 , according to the popping et al .",
    "( 2014 ) model , mentioned in sec .",
    "we generated mock maps for fir continuum , co and [ ] emission , in close analogy with the [ ] mock maps .",
    "we carried out fir foreground removal and contamination masking experiments on the total mock maps ( containing the signal + foreground + contamination and also the instrumental noise ) to recover the angular power spectrum of original [ ] maps .",
    "we pointed out that , in order to efficiently subtract the co and [ ] contamination one could discard pixels that are allegedly contaminated by contamination lines .",
    "this is feasible if the map has sufficient angular resolution to avoid losing too many pixels .",
    "we estimated that if the intensity map has a resolution @xmath211 , contamination can be suppressed by dropping all pixels containing galaxies brighter than @xmath212 and located at the relevant redshift range .",
    "we found that the @xmath1 [ ] signal comes mainly from halos in the mass range @xmath10 ( h - band apparent magnitude @xmath213 ) ; as this mass range is narrow , intensity mapping is an ideal experiment to investigate these early galaxies .",
    "the [ ] signal from @xmath214 is detectable for a ground - based , noise - limited telescope with a 6  m aperture , @xmath167  k , a fir camera with @xmath11 pixels in about @xmath215  hr total integration time . although feasible in principle , the experiment is difficult to be performed using currently available telescopes .",
    "in addition , the integration time itself could be longer if the atmospheric conditions are on average worse than assumed here . therefore a dedicated telescope is required and its location is essential . in any case",
    ", our study will serve as a robust guideline for the design of future facilities .",
    "a further motivation of a [ ] intensity mapping experiment is to detect the signal from faint galaxies that are unresolved even in deepest optical / ir surveys .",
    "this is important as these faint galaxies are believed to contribute most ionizing photons to reionization @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we therefore discuss the feasibility of such a kind of experiment .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ power_fraction ] , at @xmath78 , faint galaxies hosted in halos below @xmath216 only produce less than 1% of the total [ ] power spectrum .",
    "therefore an intensity mapping experiment aimed at detecting such faint galaxies could only be carried out by a telescope whose noise level is background - limited , such as a cryogenic space telescope . in this case",
    "the noise is mainly due to poisson fluctuations of the cmb @xcite : @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the cmb emission at @xmath157 . for the following calculation",
    "we adopt a 2  m aperture telescope flux of bright high-@xmath12 galaxies . ] and @xmath219  hr , which is appropriate as a reference for a space instrument with a low noise level .    to analyze the [ ] signal of these faint galaxies , the [ ] flux from bright galaxies needs to be measured by a high - resolution interferometer array , and then subtracted in the relevant pixels . in the @xmath220  ghz frequency bin , in our light - cone there are @xmath221 halos with [ ] line flux @xmath222  wm@xmath223 .",
    "these halos have @xmath224 .",
    "in addition , there are @xmath225 halos having co and [ ] contamination line flux above @xmath226  wm@xmath223 . by assuming a line width of 50  km s@xmath6 , to resolve these halos with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath227",
    ", the required sensitivity is @xmath228  jy . for comparison , at 316  ghz for a channel width of 50  km s@xmath6 , alma sensitivity with 34 antennas is @xmath229  jy with 28 hr . assuming a @xmath176(20 arcsec)@xmath14 fov for alma , to cover a sky region of @xmath151 deg@xmath14 , we need @xmath230 pointings .",
    "therefore , even for only one frequency bin the required integration time is so high ( @xmath231  hour ! ) to make the experiment unfeasible with current technology .    in spite of this ,",
    "we generate new maps including only the [ ] signal and contamination from halos with a line flux below @xmath232  wm@xmath223 .",
    "such halos have @xmath233 , therefore we can use the @xmath2 relation in p14 simulation .",
    "we can recover the [ ] power spectrum using the procedures detailed in sec .",
    "[ comasking ] , with the following considerations .",
    "here we have assumed that galaxies with [ ] /co/ [ ] line flux above @xmath226  wm@xmath223 have already been resolved .",
    "thus , when removing contamination , we can directly subtract the flux of the resolved sources in the relevant frequency bin , instead of discarding the pixel completely",
    ". additionally , here the [ ] signal to fir continuum ratio is even smaller , which allows us to take out the first 15 modes in continuum subtraction . in fig .",
    "[ angular_power_recovered_faint ] we show the original and recovered power spectrum from @xmath234 .",
    "we can see that the experiment is indeed possible at @xmath37 . at higher",
    "redshift , though , the recovery of the [ ] signal from faint galaxies is still hampered by the noise level .    during the final stages of this work ,",
    "@xcite presented a investigation of the [ ] signal from high-@xmath12 galaxies through mock surveys obtained from semi - numerical simulations .",
    "the two studies are in broad agreement , although they differ in the conclusions concerning the fir continuum , which we found to be much stronger than both the [ ] signal and contamination .",
    "hence , accurately subtracting this foreground is vital in order to recover the [ ] signal .",
    "the good news are that we showed here that the proposed algorithm to remove a spectrally smooth component from each line of sight , inspired by 21 cm experiments , can be successfully applied to [ ] intensity mapping as well .    finally , we comment on a possible caveat of our work , related to the fact that the v15 model neglects the contribution of hii regions to the [ ] emission .",
    "we have already shown that hii regions in the diffuse medium do not have significant contribution compared with the cold neutral medium and warm neutral medium ( see fig .",
    "8 in @xcite ) , and v15 further shows that [ ] emission by cold neutral medium and warm neutral medium is negligible compared with pdrs .",
    "for what concerns hii regions surrounding molecular clouds ( mc ) , we consider the mc properties predicted by the v15 model : number density , @xmath235  @xmath236 ; size , @xmath237  pc ; ionization parameter is estimated without considering the mc optical depth @xmath238 to ionizing photons .",
    "if @xmath238 is considered , @xmath239 will become smaller and the [ ] emission from hii regions will further decrease . ] @xmath240 .",
    "these fiducial values for @xmath241 and @xmath239 are close to the parameters used in fig . 2 of , where hii regions represent mc outskirts with column density @xmath242  cm@xmath223 .",
    "from this figure , we can see that in correspondence of the mc column density expected by the v15 model ( @xmath244  cm@xmath223 ) the [ ] emission is almost 50 time stronger than the one at the edge of the hii regions , implying that the latter only contribute @xmath245 to the total emission .",
    "this calculation allows us to conclude that in the v15 model hii regions are expected to provide a negligible contribution to the total [ ] emission , once compared with pdrs .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the results by @xcite .",
    "in fact , this author finds that for @xmath246  @xmath236 and @xmath247 @xmath248 .",
    "the hii regions contribution to the [ ] emission remains , however , a very controversial topic .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath249 in carina nebula , which is a single star formation region in milky way .",
    "@xcite report fractions spanning a range @xmath250 in their samples .",
    "@xcite observed two lyman alpha emitters ( lae ) at @xmath251 , concluded that in these laes ( which are actually members of an interacting system including quasars ) most of the [ ] emission is from the ionized medium .",
    "however , we also note that @xcite found that hii regions contribution is typically less than 15% for dwarf galaxies .    to summarize , the contribution of hii regions to the [ ] emission is not clearly known , especially for galaxies at @xmath1 , since [ ] observations are still poor at these epochs .",
    "given that @xmath252 is expected to be negligible according to current state - of - the - art theoretical models , we do not consider the [ ] emission from hii regions as a major component in our calculations . accounting for this contribution ( e.g. @xmath253 ) would only enhance the [ ] power spectrum ( by a factor of @xmath254 ) , making the signal stronger .",
