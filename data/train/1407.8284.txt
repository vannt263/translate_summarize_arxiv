    "in this part of the supplementary material we provide the basic physical background as well the technical details of our density - operator approach to thermotransport through strongly interacting nanostructures .",
    "it combines the general reduced density - operator approach , accounting for the strong local interaction @xmath23 , with a real - time diagrammatic method for the calculation of self - energies that determine transition rates of a master equation .",
    "the approach is perturbative and well - controlled in the regime where the tunneling rates are well below the electrode temperatures , @xmath86 .",
    "we go beyond standard approaches by including the competition of all @xmath47 and @xmath48 transition rates into the master equation for the state occupations and  what is new in particular  calculating the full energy - transport rate matrix to @xmath48 .",
    "see refs .   for more details and applications in the context of charge transport .",
    "before we present the detailed derivation of the theoretical method in the next section , we discuss the general form of the resulting master equation and current formulas and their physical significance .",
    "in particular , we summarize the dependence of the transition rates on the level position and bias voltage in support of the central discussion in the main article explaining fig .  3 .",
    "our master equation describes the nonequilibrium state of the quantum dot , in particular the occupations @xmath88 of the quantum states @xmath89 , @xmath90 , in a statistical mixture @xmath91 in the stationary long - time limit @xmath92 for clarity in the indexing of @xmath93 and @xmath51 we denoted the two - electron singlet by @xmath94 .",
    "the transition rates obey an exact sum rule @xmath95 which derives from the probability conservation @xmath96 .",
    "we can thus restrict our discussion of the _ transition rates _",

    "these rates are dominated by their @xmath47 contributions , which coincide with fermi s golden rule expressions @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "whenever one of the fermi functions changes between 0 and 1 , a transport resonance is naively expected [ i.e. , without solving the master equation  ] , i.e. , at one of the eight lines defined in the @xmath108 plane by @xmath109 these are sketched in ( b ) : in the indicated set regimes transport by @xmath47 transitions between two ground states is energetically possible , whereas outside these regimes a single ground state is stable .",
    "the set rates vary exponentially when going off - resonance , i.e. , @xmath110 .",
    "these rates have @xmath48 corrections which describe the shift and broadening of the resonance .",
    "however , the naive expectation for a resonance is not precise in general , even when staying in @xmath47 : in we will discuss anomalous temperature - dependent shifts [ cf .  ] which can be understood only when actually solving the master - equation .",

    "@xmath111 , @xmath112 + these rates are due to @xmath48 processes and cause transitions between the @xmath21 spin states , see ( a ) . the inelastic excitation rate @xmath111 is exponentially suppressed for @xmath113 but starting from @xmath114 it steadily increases as one goes beyond the red onset line in ( b ) .",
    "this is directly reflected by the inelastic current as function of the bias plotted in the inset to fig .",
    "3(c ) in the main article and also below in ( d ) .",
    "the inelastic relaxation rate @xmath112 , in contrast , is nonzero at zero bias and increases from there .",
    "+ the explanation of the central results of the main article in fig .",
    "3 revolves around the fact that at low bias the energy current contributions due to @xmath111 and @xmath112 cancel each other [ regime ( iv ) ] .",
    "this cancellation is undone once the relaxation rate @xmath115 gets `` overridden '' by _ either _ the set rate @xmath116 _ or _",
    "@xmath117 of @xmath47 is switched on [ crossing either line ( v ) ] . once _",
    "both @xmath116 and @xmath117 _ are switched on their energy contributions give rise to a new cancellation and the energy current is again reduced [ regime ( vi ) ] , see ( a ) .",
    "* _ electron pair / hole pair tunneling rates _ @xmath118 _ and _ @xmath119 + these transition rates are often overlooked and were first pointed out in ref .  .",
    "they are generated in @xmath48 and lead to _ real _ occupation of the charge state 2 ( 0 ) in regimes where only charge states 0 and 1 ( 1 and 2 ) are accessible , respectively , by @xmath47 set processes , see ( a ) .",
    "this leads to a step resonance in @xmath60 , well below the set resonance  @xcite [ not indicated in ( b ) to maintain clarity , but see line ( vii ) in fig . 2 of the main article ] that would lead to real occupation of this state when staying in @xmath47 .",
    "remarkably , in the energy conductance these pair - tunneling processes appear much more prominently , as mentioned in the discussion section of the main article .",
    "an important aspect of our method is that we consistently calculate the _ nonequilibrium _ populations of the quantum dot from the master equation   instead of just combining some of the above transition rates with equilibrium occupations as is sometimes done in inelastic scattering theories . in our discussion of the processes responsible for the features in fig .  3 of the main article",
    "we have carefully verified our identification of the physics by comparing with the bias and energy - level dependence of the full numerically calculated rate matrices and the resulting occupations and current contributions .",

    "this is due to the kirchhoff law ( charge conservation ) . for the heat or energy current",
    "no equivalent of the kirchhoff law holds , and in particular when going to @xmath48 the energy - current rate matrix @xmath130 needs to be calculated separately .",
    "this is the main technical achievement underlying the results reported in the main article .      in this section",
    "we derive the master equation and the current formulas starting from a general microscopic hamiltonian @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 act on the corresponding hilbert spaces of the electronic reservoirs and the quantum dot , respectively .",
    "these two subsystems are coupled by @xmath134 which is assumed to be bilinear in the electron field operators and the reservoirs are effectively noninteracting , i.e. , @xmath132 is quadratic in the fields .",
    "we first set up a perturbation theory in the tunnel coupling between the quantum dot and the reservoirs .",
    "this is formulated from the start in liouville - fock space and has as a main advantage that one does not need to introduce an imaginary time or a keldysh contour_even for non - equilibrium problems _ : the time evolution of the density operator is fully described on a _",

    "( i.e. , expanded in @xmath193 ) .",
    "these two answers are discussed subsequently .",
    "it has been known since the beginning of the real - time diagrammatic formulation of the density - operator transport theory that the exact solution , taking a landauer form , is incorporated  @xcite when performing the complete summation of the diagrammatic series for the self - energy @xmath230 or rate matrix @xmath51 in powers of @xmath193 .",
    "this seemed only explicitly doable for simple concrete examples such as the noninteracting resonant level model ( without spin )  @xcite .",
    "the fact that in the density - operator approach the @xmath46 limit is not easy to see _ in general _ may seem puzzling at first , since for , e.g. , green s functions approaches , based on an expansion in the interaction @xmath23 but exact in @xmath193 , this limit is trivially recovered .",
    "however , the density - operator approach is built around the picture of a locally strongly interacting system : it is entirely formulated in terms of many - body density operators and therefore carries a certain `` overhead '' in the @xmath46 limit .    in the recently developed  @xcite formulation of the same theory  used in this article",
    " this noninteracting limit becomes entirely transparent by exploiting the field superoperators .",
    "this works for any number of orbitals including spin and allowing for arbitrary tunnel coupling matrix elements ( breaking any local orbital and spin symmetry ) . for this only",
    "the wide - band limit needs to be assumed for simplicity , which prevails anyhow in practical applications and which is not an essential restriction .",
    "this allows for a single renormalization step  @xcite to be performed with the following very simple result : starting from our series    1 .",
    "one replaces all liouvillians @xmath171 by @xmath254 , which introduces an energy - independent level broadening .",
    "importantly , this is _ derived _ , not put in by hand .",
    "one leaves out all terms in the series containing @xmath255 superoperators since they are included via the first step .",
    "one obtains a new perturbation theory of the same form which is however much simpler .",
    "importantly , taking this renormalized perturbation theory to finite order @xmath85 ( @xmath256 ) for a 2 ( @xmath55 ) level quantum dot one recovers the _ exact _ density - operator evolution for @xmath46 . moreover , for one - particle observables such as the charge current a first order calculation is already exact for @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the @xmath210 perturbation theory   used in the present article already has the correct form of the exact solution , except that the bare liouvillian is used ( i.e. , step 1 is missing ) .",
    "since we focus on the limit @xmath195 we instead incorporate the corresponding term with @xmath257 superoperators ( step 2 ) , which includes the leading broadening corrections , see also below .",

    "finally , we note that going beyond the perturbative limit in @xmath193 _ for finite _ @xmath23 is possible within the framework that we use and seamlessly connects to the real - time renormalization - group approach  @xcite .",

    "the second factor is the effect of the coulomb interaction @xmath286 suppressing the magnitude of the inelastic current relative to the resonant one .",

    "we immediately emphasize that our estimates have been conservative in the following sense :    * the above scaling is basically those around the center of the coulomb blockade regime where all currents are minimal .",
    "away from the center all the effects are enhanced .",
    "* we used strictly perturbative formulas , assuming regimes where @xmath290 is small . for larger values of @xmath193 and lower temperatures renormalization effects can greatly enhance the inelastic tunneling relative to the resonant tunneling , as is well known for charge transport , and expected also for energy transport , see for a simple formula .",
    "we thus underestimate the heat currents that one should experimentally be able to resolve .",
    "a more detailed analysis is of interest but relies on details of a given experimental setup as well as goes beyond the scope of the present article and the methods employed here , which mainly serve to identify the basic processes of energy transport that were overlooked so far .",

    "for the charge transport at the resonance this effect has been first discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism causing the effect is however quite general and already plays a role in regimes where _ only set transport occurs_. understanding this mechanism is relevant for the coset thermometry discussed in . in general , transport through a quantum dot shows a resonance whenever a new transition rate is `` switched on '' by changing the energy levels relative to the chemical potentials of the electrodes ( either by gate or bias voltage or both ) .",

    "<S> inspection of the magnitude of the inelastic step at @xmath3 as function of the level position @xmath59 in ( a ) reveals a dramatic difference : whereas the charge conductance amplitude at @xmath3 is smooth and featureless as @xmath59 is varied , the energy conductance amplitude sharply drops at ( v ) when @xmath68 or @xmath69 . </S>",

    "<S> we now explain in three steps ( a)-(c ) how physically these dramatic differences come about , by following the vertical line in the schematic ( b ) at @xmath71 . </S>",

    "<S> the excited state @xmath63 becomes occupied by inelastic tunneling [ ( b ) ] and it relaxes by similar inelastic processes . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions are indicated by red arrows in the lower inset in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives an increased charge conductance as electrons find an additional path through the quantum dot while keeping the charge fixed to @xmath21 , only virtually visiting other charge states @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the energy current is relatively low due to two effects : first , real charge fluctuations are suppressed ( @xmath21 ) and only processes @xmath75 occur , the rates for both of which are @xmath76 , much smaller than the rates @xmath47 . </S>",

    "<S> this composite mechanism is called cotunneling assisted set  @xcite ( coset ) and involves _ real _ occupation of the @xmath81 state , despite the prevalence of @xmath21 states due to coulomb blockade .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(c ) when @xmath2 finally crosses the blue line ( vi ) in ( b ) the _ other _ green relaxation path via the @xmath24 state also becomes active as the upper inset shows . </S>",

    "<S> remarkably , this increased relaxation does not increase the energy current as above , but instead suppresses it . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the signed energy - current contributions from the two @xmath47 pathways now cancel each other  in contrast to case ( b ) where only one such pathway is active  thereby strongly reducing the energy current . </S>",
