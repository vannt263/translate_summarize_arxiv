    "* thick - wall effect . *",
    "giant leaps have thick walls , and thick walls slow decay ",
    "they encroach upon the interior true vacuum and increase @xmath2 . for monoflux transitions , which proceed by small bubbles , this effect is large and in the end sinks giant leaps . however , as we saw in fig .",
    "[ sampleinstantonmulti ] , multiflux transitions proceed by bigger bubbles , which can accommodate the thick walls with a proportionately smaller increase in @xmath2 .    incorporating all these effects ,",
    "we have calculated the tunneling rate as a function of @xmath49 , in the thin - brane approximation .",
    "this allows us to track the most likely decay chain . from the highest de sitter states , the fastest decay is to decompactify . from somewhat lower down",
    ", it depends on the type of landscape . for monoflux landscapes , built of many units of a single flux , the most likely decay chain is to discharge one unit at a time , proceeding by small steps all the way to the bottom . for multiflux landscapes , built of a single unit each of many fluxes ,",
    "high de sitter states take a few small steps before a catastrophic giant leap all the way to a bubble of nothing .    what about intermediate cases , with many units of many fluxes",
    "? different types of flux still like to discharge together , because they enjoy all the benefits described above .",
    "that said , if the @xmath149 all share a common factor @xmath150 , then the bubble of nothing ( @xmath151 ) is necessarily subdominant .",
    "because monoflux landscapes take small steps , we know that tunneling by @xmath152 must be faster . if the @xmath149 do nt share a common factor and the @xmath15 vary , then the cases proliferate , but for much of the landscape , giant leaps will still be the fastest decay .    if , as seems plausible , we ourselves live in a multiflux landscape , then we draw two conclusions .",
    "we arrived here by an exponentially subdominant decay , and we will leave here by a bubble of nothing .",
    "thanks to paul steinhardt and herman verlinde for useful feedback and to jose juan blanco - pillado , handhika ramadhan and benjamin shlaer for helpful discussion on the bubble of nothing .",
    "hat tip to kendrick and mari , much respect .",
    "in sec .  4 , we considered both flux tunneling instantons and decompactification instantons .",
    "but there is one more possibility . in this appendix",
    ", we construct the instanton that simultaneously discharges flux _ and _ decompactifies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : decompactification]a we plot the standard decompactification instanton .",
    "this instanton does nt change the flux , and instead nucleates a bubble inside of which @xmath22 is over the hump in the effective potential of fig .  1 and will classically roll @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : decompactification]b we plot the new instanton . as before",
    ", @xmath22 is over the hump , so this instanton corresponds to decompactification .",
    "but there is now a charged brane , so that there is less flux on the inside , the effective potential is reduced , and hump is shrunk .      which method of decompactifying is fastest ? on the one hand",
    "the new method lowers the hump in the effective potential , making decompactification easier . on the other hand",
    ", it requires the nucleation of a brane , making decompactification harder .",
    "figure  [ fig : bdecompactification ] shows that this second effect is strongest , so that the new instantons are always subdominant to standard decompactification .",
    "this figure shows that decompactification gets slower the more flux is simultaneously dropped .    .",
    "at @xmath153 , no flux is dropped , so this is just standard decompactification . since the rate grows with @xmath49 , simultaneously dropping flux and decompactifying is subdominant to standard decompactification .",
    "similar plots , with identical conclusions , can be drawn from other de sitter false vacua and for multiflux landscapes.,width=384 ]    indeed , standard decompactification so dominates this new instanton , that eventually the new instanton disappears at a critical @xmath154 ( just as the regular flux tunneling instanton disappears from a high enough de sitter state , as in the top left pane of fig .  4 ) .",
    "see @xcite for an account of the disappearance",
    ". as the false vacuum is raised , the star moves left and eventually swallows everything , including even the standard decompactification instanton .",
    "( at the moment the standard decompactification instanton is swallowed , it is replaced by a hawking - moss instanton@xcite . )",
