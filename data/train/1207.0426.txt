    "the models of nuclear masses are continuously challenged by the advances in experimental techniques which nowadays are extending the nuclear chart to previously unexplored regions of exotic isotopes and superheavy elements .",
    "the theoretical description of nuclear masses takes place primarily along two main approaches . on the one hand , in the microscopic nuclear models",
    ", the nuclear binding energy is obtained from calculations with energy density functionals based on effective nuclear interactions @xcite . in the microscopic - macroscopic ( mic - mac ) models @xcite , the nuclear binding energy is obtained as the sum of a part that varies smoothly with the number of nucleons plus an oscillatory correction originated by the quantum effects .",
    "the smooth part of the mic - mac models is obtained from a liquid - drop model approach , whereas the shell correction is usually evaluated by the strutinsky averaging method in an external potential well .    in our previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the strutinsky average can be replaced by the semiclassical energy computed by means of the wigner - kirkwood ( wk ) @xmath0 expansion of the one - body partition function @xcite , in order to evaluate the shell corrections of a system of @xmath4 neutrons and @xmath5 protons at zero temperature in an external potential .",
    "there are some reasons supporting this choice as we have discussed in ref . @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", it has been shown that the strutinsky level density is an approximation to the wk level density @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the wk @xmath0-expansion of the density matrix has a variational content and it is possible to establish a variational theory based on a strict @xmath0-expansion @xcite . we shall point out that the wk expansion is also well suited to deal with nuclei close the drip lines .",
    "although the wk level density exhibits a well known @xmath6 divergence as @xmath7 for a potential that vanishes at large distances , integrated moments of the level density , such as the energy and the accumulated level density , are well behaved in the @xmath7 limit as it has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these shell corrections , along with a simple six parameter liquid drop formula , yield a good description of ground - state masses of spherical nuclei spanning the entire periodic table @xcite .",
    "the model has also been applied to calculate the binding energies of few deformed nuclei , with a good degree of success @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the work reported earlier @xcite to the deformed nuclei and explore the predictions of the model in exotic scenarios such as drip line nuclei and the superheavy region . in this work",
    ", we mainly restrict our attention to the even - even nuclei .",
    "one of the important conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite is that in this model it is necessary to carry out the wk expansion up to the fourth - order in @xmath0 to obtain accurate shell corrections , which implies that in this case one needs to work out derivatives of the single particle potentials ( nuclear potential , coulomb potential as well as the spin - orbit potential ) up to the fourth - order , which is a rather cumbersome task .",
    "therefore , this gives rise to an interesting and important question : can the effects of the fourth - order corrections to the binding energy be absorbed into the second - order ones ?",
    "this question is important from theoretical as well as practical point of view .",
    "theoretically , this would imply that the wk series has been partially re - summed , whereas from a practical point of view , it implies that it is sufficient to expand the one - body partition function up to second - order in @xmath0 to obtain shell corrections with comparable accuracy .    the absorption , if possible , would imply that there is a factor ( we denote the factor by @xmath8 ) , which may be a function of mass number , charge number , neutron number or combinations thereof , defined as @xmath9 such that @xmath10 where , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , are second and fourth - order wk corrections to energy .",
    "this is an important issue discussed in the present article .",
    "we summarise the essential details of the semiclassical wigner - kirkwood expansion of the one - body partition function in the second section . the detailed results and their analysis forms the subject matter of the third section .",
    "the parameters of the macroscopic part of our mic - mac model , which also includes curvature correction @xcite and the wigner term @xcite , have been obtained by minimizing the @xmath13 value of the energies using a selected set of 561 even - even deformed and spherical nuclei .",
    "the ability of this mic - mac model to describe nuclei in the exotic scenarios is explored in section 4 . on the one hand ,",
    "masses of very proton rich nuclei , measured recently @xcite , are compared with the predictions of our model . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limit of the outer crust in neutron stars is studied , which involves nuclei near the neutron drip line .",
    "finally , we explore the superheavy region , and compare the theoretical alpha decay @xmath14 values and the corresponding half lives with the experimental values @xcite .",
    "the systematic investigation of the absorption factor @xmath8 as defined above is contained in the fifth section .",
    "the summary and conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "for a system of @xmath4 non interacting fermions at zero temperature in a given external potential , the quantal one - body partition function is given by : @xmath15 the hamiltonian of the system ( @xmath16 ) is expressed as : @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the one - body central potential and @xmath19 the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the replacement of the hamiltonian in the above equations by the corresponding classical hamiltonian leads to the well - known thomas - fermi equations for particle number and total energy .",
    "the wigner - kirkwood semiclassical expansion amounts to expansion of the quantal one - body partition function in the powers of planck s constant , @xmath0 , yielding systematic corrections to the thomas - fermi energy and particle number @xcite .",
    "as stated before , in this work , we carry out the wk expansion up to the fourth - order in @xmath0 . with the spin - orbit interaction , the wk expansion of the partition function",
    "can be written schematically as : @xmath20 where , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the wk partition function for the central potential ( spin - orbit part ) .",
    "the explicit expressions for these partition functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the level density @xmath23 , the particle number @xmath4 and the energy @xmath24 are obtained by appropriate laplace inversion of the wk partition function , as follows : @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the chemical potential , determined to ensure the correct particle number .",
    "the focus of the present article being the wk energy , we present the explicit expressions for the wk energies alone . following jennings _",
    "@xcite , the energy ( eq .",
    "( [ e_qm ] ) ) can be written as : @xmath29 where , @xmath30 denote the contribution to the energy of the order @xmath31 arising from laplace inversion @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath33 are corrections to the energy of the order @xmath31 due to laplace inversion @xmath34 .",

    "the shell corrections , which are the difference between the quantum mechanical and the corresponding averaged energies , can now be obtained by subtracting @xmath24 from the quantum mechanical energy . for our calculations",
    "we choose a woods - saxon potential as mean field and a suitable woods - saxon form factor in the spin - orbit sector .",
    "these potentials are generalised for taking into account deformation effects and their corresponding parameters are given in ref .",
    "the coulomb potential has been obtained by folding the proton density distribution with the coulomb interaction @xcite . in the microscopic part",
    "we have also included pairing correlations using the lipkin - nogami scheme @xcite , as described in details in ref .",
    "in the present work , we generalise the liquid drop formula employed in @xcite by adding a deformation dependent curvature energy term and the wigner term . the curvature energy term is found to be important in improving the agreement achieved between calculations and the corresponding experimental binding energies @xcite .",
    "the wigner term is expected to be important for light nuclei as well as to describe nuclei close to the proton drip line .",
    "therefore , the modified liquid drop formula used in this work reads : @xmath39a         ~+~ a_s\\left[1~+~\\frac{4k_s}{a^2}~t_z\\left(t_z~+~1\\right)\\right]a^{2/3 } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & a_{cur}\\left[1~+~\\frac{4k_{cur}}{a^2}~t_z\\left(t_z~+~1\\right)\\right ] a^{1/3 }          ~+~ \\frac{3z^2e^2}{5r_0a^{1/3}}~+~\\frac{c_4z^2}{a } ~+~ e_{w}\\ , , \\label{ldm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the terms respectively represent : volume energy , surface energy , curvature energy , coulomb energy , correction to coulomb energy due to surface diffuseness of charge distribution and the wigner energy .",
    "the coefficients @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are free parameters ; @xmath48 is the third component of isospin , and @xmath49 is the electronic charge .",
    "several parametrisations of the wigner term are available in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) . here , we adopt the following ansatz for the wigner term with a cut off on charge and mass numbers : @xmath50 where , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are free parameters . the cut offs on charge and mass numbers have been introduced since it is expected that the wigner term will make significant contributions for nuclei with low masses .",
    "the coulomb , surface and curvature terms appearing in the liquid drop formula , as defined above in eq.([ldm ] ) , need to be modified for the deformed shapes .",
    "in particular , the coulomb term is multiplied by @xmath53 where , the symbols have their usual meanings . notice that the integrals have been carried out over nuclear volume , and the lengths have been measured in units of the radius parameter @xmath54 of the nucleus with zero deformation .",
    "the transformation from six dimensional to four dimensional integrals has been accomplished by following the technique developed by kurmanov _",
    "_ @xcite . the surface term , on the other hand",
    ", is simply modified by the ratio of deformed to the corresponding spherical surface areas .",
    "the curvature energy term , too , needs to be modified to take the deformation effects into account .",
    "the modified curvature energy ( @xmath55 ) reads : @xmath56 where , @xmath57 is curvature energy at zero deformation ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the principal radii of curvature of the nuclear surface ( in the units of @xmath54 ) , defined by @xmath60 ; and @xmath61 refers to the area element of the nuclear surface . the surface parametrisation assumed in the present work",
    "is given by : @xmath62 here , the @xmath63 functions are the usual spherical harmonics and the constant @xmath64 is the volume conservation factor ( the volume enclosed by the deformed surface should be equal to the volume enclosed by an equivalent spherical surface of radius @xmath65 ) : @xmath66^{-1/3 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term @xmath67 , which is the correction to coulomb energy due to surface diffuseness of the charge distribution , does not have any explicit deformation dependence .",
    "this is because the distance function chosen here is such that the surface thickness is the same in all the directions ( see discussion about this in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the total binding energy of a nucleus with @xmath4 neutrons , @xmath5 protons and deformation parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 is given by : @xmath71 where , @xmath72 represents the microscopic part of the binding energy ( shell correction plus pairing energy ) .",
    "the microscopic part has been multiplied by a factor @xmath73 , which is chosen to be 0.85 .",
    "one of the reasons for introducing such a factor is that the coulomb potential used in the present work is less repulsive near @xmath74 than the corresponding value obtained by using the hard sphere approximation , used in the fit of proton mean field ( see discussion on this point in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the free parameters of the liquid drop formula are determined by minimising the @xmath13 value in comparison with the experimental binding energies @xcite : @xmath75 ^ 2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the calculated total binding energy for the given nucleus , @xmath77 is the corresponding experimental value @xcite , and @xmath78 is the uncertainty in @xmath77 . in the present fit , for simplicity",
    ", @xmath78 is set to 1 mev .    to obtain these parameters",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we start by setting in the liquid drop mass formula ( [ ldm ] ) the values obtained in our spherical calculation @xcite .",
    "explicitly , these values are : @xmath40 = -15.841 mev , @xmath41 = 19.173 mev , @xmath43 = -1.951 , @xmath79 = -2.577 , @xmath46 = 1.187 fm and @xmath47 = 1.247 mev .",
    "next , we choose a set of 561 even - even nuclei with @xmath1 and @xmath80 , the list of which may be found at @xcite .",
    "this set comprises doubly magic , semi magic as well as open shell nuclei , many of which are expected to be deformed .",
    "the main task now is to determine the liquid drop parameters as well as the optimal deformation parameters .",
    "the calculation proceeds in the following steps :    1 .   assuming the previously reported @xcite values of the liquid drop parameters , the binding energies of these nuclei",
    "are obtained by minimising on a range of @xmath68 values ( @xmath69 is set to zero in this step ) .",
    "this gives a preliminary estimation of @xmath68 .",
    "next , keeping this @xmath68 fixed , @xmath69 is varied to obtain minimum energy .",
    "thus , we now have preliminary values of both the deformation parameters . 2 .   in the next step , keeping the deformation parameters fixed as obtained in the earlier step , the liquid drop parameters are fitted by minimising @xmath13 .",
    "3 .   with the new values of liquid drop parameters ,",
    "the deformation parameters are obtained once again as described in step 1 , followed by a final re - fit to the liquid drop parameters .",
    "the numerical values of the new constants of the liquid drop formula obtained through this minimisation procedure are : @xmath40 = -15.435 mev , @xmath41 = 16.673 mev , @xmath42 = 3.161 mev , @xmath43 = -1.874 , @xmath79 = -2.430 , @xmath81 ( see discussion below ) , @xmath46 = 1.219 fm , @xmath47 = 0.963 mev , @xmath51 = -2.762 mev and @xmath52 = 3.725 .",
    "the values of volume , surface and coulomb coefficients differ from those reported earlier @xcite , primarily due to the inclusion of curvature and wigner terms and the deformation effects . the curvature term , as described earlier , depends on the mean curvature of the nucleus , which is a function of the geometry of the nuclear surface .",
    "therefore , the curvature energy , a priory , is expected to modify the surface energy term as well as the @xmath67 term , which is the correction due to the surface diffuseness of the charge density term .",
    "the somewhat smaller value of the volume coefficient reported here , is not surprising .",
    "the reduction is due to the influence of the curvature term , as it has also been found by pomorski and dudek ( see table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the coefficient of the isospin dependent term in the curvature energy is very difficult to determine with experimental masses . in our case",
    "the resulting statistical error in the corresponding parameter turns out to be more than 50% of the numerical value of the coefficient .",
    "further , this term is found to weaken the strength of the isospin dependent term in the surface energy by a factor of 5 .",
    "the isospin dependence in the curvature term , therefore , has been dropped from the present investigation .",
    "the _ rms _ deviation of the calculated binding energies with respect to the experiment obtained is 610 kev .",
    "the mller - nix calculations @xcite , for the same set of nuclei , yield a deviation of 656 kev .",
    "the explicit values of binding energies of our selected set of 561 even - even nuclei used in the minimisation procedure can be found at @xcite .",
    "the present calculation establishes that our model is indeed capable of reproducing binding energies of deformed nuclei as well , with excellent accuracy .",
    "the difference between the calculated and the corresponding evaluated @xcite binding energies is presented in fig .",
    "the corresponding differences obtained for the mller - nix calculations is presented in the same figure for comparison .",
    "the excellent agreement found between the calculations and experiment is amply clear from the figure .",
    "we next present and discuss the results obtained for sr , sn , gd and po isotopes as illustrative examples .",
    "the difference between the fitted and the corresponding experimental binding energies for these nuclei are plotted in figs .",
    "[ s2n1 ] and [ s2n2 ] , along with the corresponding differences obtained from the mller - nix calculations @xcite .",
    "the figures reveal that the calculated binding energies ( denoted by wk ) are quite close to the experimental values .",
    "the differences are found to vary quite smoothly as a function of mass number .",
    "next , we present the two - neutron separation energies for these chains .",
    "the two - nucleon separation energies highlight the shell structure in an isotopic chain .",
    "correct prediction of these separation energies is crucial for determination of the drip lines .",
    "the calculated and the corresponding experimental @xcite two - neutron separation energies are plotted in figs .",
    "[ sr - sn ] and [ gd - pb ] .",
    "the figures reveal that the present calculations reproduce the experimental separation energies very well and that the shell - gaps are also reproduced nicely .",
    "in addition , the systematics of deformation parameters obtained in these calculations turns out to be reasonable . as an illustrative example",
    ", we focus on the sr - zr region .",
    "it is well known from the systematics of experimentally measured charge radii @xcite that the charge radii increase dramatically by 2% for @xmath82rb , @xmath83sr and @xmath84zr , in comparison to their respective lighter isotopes .",
    "this jump may be attributed to the possibility of onset of highly deformed shapes in the ground - state , around this neutron number ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "our calculations , too , reveal existence of highly deformed ground - states ( with @xmath85 ) around neutron number 60 , in the sr - zr region .",
    "the values of @xmath68 obtained in this work for kr , sr , zr and mo chains are plotted in fig .",
    "[ defor ] .",
    "the sudden change in the ground - state deformation around the neutron number 60 is very clear from the figure .",
    "further , it is also well known that the ground - states of @xmath86kr , @xmath87sr and @xmath88zr have very large ( @xmath89 ) deformation .",
    "this is known to be due to population in the intruder @xmath90 state .",
    "thus , the ground - state of @xmath88zr is a 12 particle - 12 hole state , which is manifested again by an extremely large stable deformation in the ground - state of @xmath88zr .",
    "this has been verified independently , for example , by the relativistic mean field calculation @xcite , density dependent hartree fock calculation with skyrme interaction @xcite , as well as by the hartree fock band mixing calculation @xcite .",
    "the deformation parameters reported in the mller - nix table @xcite , too , are consistent with the discussion above .",
    "it is gratifying to note that the present calculations , indeed , yield @xmath68 = -0.36 , -0.41 and 0.44 respectively , for @xmath86kr , @xmath87sr and @xmath88zr , which is in tune with the mean field as well as the mic - mac mller - nix calculations cited above .",
    "we next test the ability of the present model to describe binding energies of the neutron rich and neutron deficient nuclei , as well as of the superheavy nuclei . to this end",
    ", we now present a few exploratory calculations .",
    ".the binding energies and one proton separation energies for proton rich nuclei . ` calc . '",
    "( mn ) represent the results obtained in the present work ( by mller and nix @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental binding energies have been obtained from mass excess values reported by tu _",
    "the experimental @xmath91 values have been also been adopted from ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with these approximate shell corrections , we make a re - fit to the liquid drop parameters .",
    "comparison between the liquid drop parameters as reported in section 3 and the ones obtained with the approximate shell corrections is presented in table 3 .",
    "it is indeed gratifying to note that the liquid drop parameters obtained in the two cases are almost identical , and so is the _ rms _ deviation of the calculated binding energies with respect to experiment @xcite .",
    "this substantiates the validity of the parametrisation of @xmath8 .    to test the robustness of the parametrisation of @xmath8",
    "further , we calculate the constants @xmath92 s in eq .",
    "( [ alpph ] ) using just four nuclei ( @xmath93ca , @xmath84sn , @xmath94gd and @xmath95pb ) instead of 2171 nuclei as described above .",
    "it is found that the numerical values of the constants practically remain the same . to test the validity of these parameters ,",
    "the liquid drop parameters are re - worked employing the new values of @xmath96 s .",
    "it is found that the liquid drop parameters thus obtained are practically equal to the ones reported in the right most column of table 3 .",
    "we close this section , by concluding that the absorption of fourth - order wigner - kirkwood corrections into the second contributions is reliable , and can be used in large scale mic - mac calculations .",
    "the absorption also has the advantage of reducing the numerical noise that might arise in the higher order derivatives of the potentials .",
    "the semiclassical wigner - kirkwood @xmath0 expansion of the one - body partition function has been employed instead of the strutinsky averaging scheme to calculate the shell corrections within the framework of a mic - mac model .",
    "the microscopic part of the energy also contains pairing contributions that are obtained using the lipkin - nogami scheme .",
    "we have improved the macroscopic part of the model as compared with the one used in our previous work @xcite by including the curvature term as well as the wigner contribution .",
    "with just ten adjustable parameters , our model reproduces the binding energies of 561 even - even spherical and deformed nuclei with _ rms _ deviation of 610 kev .",
    "we have tested this new mic - mac model near the proton and neutron drip lines as well as in the superheavy region .",
    "our present calculations show that the mic - mac model proposed in this paper reproduces remarkably well the recent experimental results in these exotic scenarios .",
    "further , a systematic study of the ratio of the fourth - order and second - order wigner - kirkwood energies has been carried out .",
    "we find that the ratio of these two energies behaves in a very systematic manner .",
    "we have shown that this ratio can be parametrised accurately by a simple expression , implying that the fourth - order corrections can be absorbed into the second - order contributions in a very simple way .",
    "we have checked that using this simple procedure , we recover practically the same parameters of the macroscopic part , without deteriorating the quality of agreement achieved with the full wigner kirkwood calculation including explicitly the fourth - order contributions .",
    "therefore , this simplified calculation of shell corrections can be used confidently in the large scale mic - mac calculations that we plan to carry out as the next step .",
    "finally , we point out that there is still some room for improving our model particularly in two specific directions . on the one hand , the full blocking procedure in the pairing calculations of odd - odd , odd - even and even - odd nuclei , that may be particularly relevant for spherical nuclei , has to be introduced . on the other hand , refinements in the mean field woods - saxon potential and in the distance function",
    "are still needed to study with our model not only neutron rich nuclei , but also fission barriers .",
    "this would require large scale calculations with the model , for which , the simplification proposed above may be very useful .",

    "<S> next , we systematically explore the fourth - order wigner - kirkwood corrections to the smooth part of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the ratio of the fourth - order to the second - order corrections behaves in a very regular manner as a function of the asymmetry parameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to absorb the fourth - order corrections into the second - order contributions to the binding energy , which enables to simplify and speed up the calculation of deformed nuclei . </S>"
