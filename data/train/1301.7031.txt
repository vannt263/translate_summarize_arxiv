    "adaptive beamforming techniques have been developed to improve the reception of a desired signal while suppressing interference at the output of a sensor array .",
    "it is an ubiquitous task in array signal processing with applications in radar , sonar , astronomy , and more recently , in wireless communications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a number of adaptive algorithms for the beamformer design are available and have been extensively studied @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the most common are the linearly constrained adaptive algorithms @xcite-@xcite . in general",
    ", the linear constraints correspond to prior knowledge of certain parameters such as the direction of arrival ( doa ) of the desired signal .",
    "an important issue that is considered in adaptive beamforming is the design criterion . among many adaptive algorithms found in the literature ,",
    "the most promising criteria employed are the constrained minimum variance ( cmv ) @xcite and the constrained constant modulus ( ccm ) @xcite due to their simplicity and effectiveness .",
    "the cmv criterion aims to minimize the beamformer output power while maintaining the array response on the doa of the desired signal .",
    "the ccm criterion is a positive measure @xcite of the deviation of the beamformer output from a constant modulus condition subject to a constraint on the array response of the desired signal . by measuring the deviation",
    ", the ccm criterion provides more information than the cmv for the parameter estimation of constant modulus constellations in the beamformer design .",
    "numerous adaptive algorithms have been proposed according to the constrained version criteria to realize the beamformer design @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the major drawback of the full - rank methods , such as stochastic gradient ( sg ) @xcite and recursive least - squares ( rls ) @xcite , @xcite , is that these methods require a large amount of samples to reach the steady - state when the number of elements in the filter is large .",
    "furthermore , in dynamic scenarios , filters with many elements usually fail or provide poor performance in tracking signals embedded in interference and noise .",
    "reduced - rank signal processing was originally motivated to provide a way out of this dilemma @xcite-@xcite . for the application of beamforming , reduced - rank schemes project the received vector onto a lower dimensional subspace and perform the filter optimization within this subspace .",
    "one of the popular reduced - rank schemes is the multistage wiener filter ( mswf ) , which employs the minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) @xcite , and its extended versions that utilize the cmv and ccm criteria were reported in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another technique that resembles the mswf @xcite , @xcite is the auxiliary - vector filtering ( avf ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a joint iterative optimization ( jio ) scheme , which was presented recently in @xcite , employs the cmv criterion with a relative low - complexity adaptive implementation to achieve better performance than the existing methods .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a robust reduced - rank scheme based on joint iterative optimization of filters with the ccm criterion in detail and compare it with that of the cmv to show its improved performance in the studied scenarios .",
    "the developed ccm reduced - rank scheme consists of a bank of full - rank adaptive filters , which constitutes the transformation matrix , and an adaptive reduced - rank filter that operates at the output of the bank of full - rank filters .",
    "the transformation matrix maps the received signal into a lower dimension , which is then processed by the reduced - rank filter to estimate the transmitted signal .",
    "the proposed scheme provides an iterative exchange of information between the transformation matrix and the reduced - rank filter and thus leads to improved convergence and tracking performance .",
    "this paper makes two contributions :    * a reduced - rank scheme according to the constant modulus ( cm ) criterion subject to different constraints is proposed based on the jio of adaptive filters .",
    "this robust reduced - rank scheme is investigated for both direct - form processor ( dfp ) and the generalized sidelobe canceller ( gsc ) @xcite structures . for each structure ,",
    "a family of computationally efficient reduced - rank sg and rls type algorithms are derived for the proposed scheme .",
    "the gram - schmidt ( gs ) technique is employed in the proposed algorithms to reformulate the transformation matrix for further improving performance . an automatic rank selection technique is developed to determine the most adequate rank for the proposed algorithms . * the complexity comparison is presented to show the computational costs of the proposed reduced - rank algorithms .",
    "an analysis of the convergence properties for the proposed reduced - rank scheme is carried out .",
    "simulations are performed to show the improved convergence and tracking performance of the proposed algorithms over existing methods .",
    "the effectiveness of the gs and automatic rank selection techniques for the proposed algorithms is visible in the results .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : we outline a system model for beamforming in section ii .",
    "based on this model , the full - rank and reduced - rank ccm beamformer designs are reviewed .",
    "the proposed reduced - rank scheme based on the cm criterion subject to different constraints is presented in section iii , and the proposed adaptive algorithms are detailed for implementation in section iv .",
    "the complexity and convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is carried out in section v. simulation results are provided and discussed in section vi , and conclusions are drawn in section vii .",
    "in this section , we first describe a system model to express the received data vector . based on this model ,",
    "the full - rank beamformer design according to the cm criterion subject to the constraint on the array response is introduced for the dfp and the gsc structures .",

    "the ccm criterion is a positive measure @xcite of the deviation of the beamformer output from a constant modulus condition subject to a constraint on the array response of the desired signal .",
    "compared with the cmv criterion , it exploits a constant modulus property of the transmitted signals , utilizes the deviation to provide more information for the parameter estimation of the constant modulus constellations , and achieves a superior performance @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the ccm beamformer minimizes the contribution of interference and noise while maintaining the gain along the look direction to be constant .",
    "the weight expression of the full - rank ccm design is given in @xcite .",
