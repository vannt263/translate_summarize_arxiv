    "cold atom technology provides a novel laboratory for the many - body study of quantum liquids . in this paper , we focus on the low - temperature cold atom mixtures of dilute boson and fermion quantum liquids .",
    "the simultaneous trapping and cooling of fermionic and bosonic atoms has become a routine ingredient of the experimental cold atom repertoire .",
    "the original motivation for trapping these quantum gas mixtures was sympathetic cooling @xcite : in the quantum degenerate regime , the standard evaporative cooling technique  the removal of the most energetic particles  is more efficient with bosonic than with fermionic atoms .",
    "evaporatively cooled bosons , often a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , can subsequently cool the fermion particles by thermal contact .",
    "in addition to its sympathetic cooling use , theorists also have pointed out intriguing prospects of cold atom technology for many - body studies : as the elementary bec excitations are acoustic phonon modes , fermion - bec mixtures consist of fermions interacting with a phonon fluid , thereby representing a large class of systems .",
    "a cold atom feature that is highly unusual in this broad context is the continuous tunability of the fermion - boson ( and hence fermion - phonon ) interactions , obtained by adjusting the strength of a homogeneous , external magnetic field  the feshbach resonance . in general",
    ", the unprecedented accessibility , novel knobs , and probes suggest that in their role of prototypes of fermion - phonon fluid , the cold atom fermion - bec mixtures can be used to break new ground by exploring polaron - like self - localization @xcite or by measuring the rate of heat - exchange between strongly coupled fermion - phonon fluids ( temperature relaxation ) .    from the perspective of quantum liquid physics ,",
    "a particularly relevant phenomenon is the phase - separation transition that the fermion - bec mixture is expected to undergo as the fermion - boson interaction strength is increased @xcite .",
    "this transition is the analogue of the phase separation of condensed @xmath0 fluid mixtures studied in traditional low - temperature physics @xcite . as we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec_mft ] , we expect the cold atom phase - separation transition to be first order @xcite , as was observed in the condensed - matter helium mixtures . accessing this transition by varying the densities and/or the interaction strengths would allow the unusual , though highly relevant , experimental exploration of first - order ( zero temperature ) quantum phase transitions . as a first - order transition , its dynamics can involve nucleation or a spinodal decomposition . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    ", the nucleation process can not be triggered by thermal activation and has to proceed via a many - body tunneling process .",
    "hence , the cold atom fermion - bec mixtures promise the prospect of many - body tunneling studies , as well as investigations of first - order quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the focus of our work in this paper is the role of mediated interactions ",
    "the modification of the interactions of particles in one fluid caused by the presence of the other fluid .",
    "this phenomenon is of fundamental importance : fermionic particles interact via boson - field mediated interactions in the standard model . in the phase separation of low - temperature condensed helium mixtures ,",
    "mediated interactions play a crucial role @xcite . in those systems ,",
    "the condensed @xmath1 fermion liquid remains normal  ( i.e. , does not become superfluid ) in the experimentally accessible regime , whereas the @xmath2 boson fluid can take on a bec - like superfluid state .",
    "boson mediated interactions are expected to make the fermions superfluid @xcite as well , but at temperatures that are an order of magnitude lower than can be reached with present cooling technology .",
    "the condensed @xmath0 mixtures undergo phase separation when the fraction of fermion particles exceeds a minimal value : the system then breaks translational symmetry by forming local regions in which only fermion particles reside .",
    "while our understanding of theses systems remains limited by the difficulties involved in accounting for strong interaction effects , theorists understood early on that the phase - separation phenomenon is triggered by mediated interactions @xcite .",
    "mean - field studies of the cold atom fermion - bec mixtures indicated that these gas mixtures would similarly undergo phase separation under experimentally attainable conditions .",
    "hence , it should be possible to study mediated interactions in a cold atom environment that is amenable to a first - principle description .",
    "mediated interactions stem from a particular type of correlations : the local density of the second fluid is altered near the position of a particle 1  of the first fluid , thereby changing the potential energy experienced by another , nearby particle 2  of the first fluid .",
    "however , most cold atom phase separation studies have been carried out in the mean - field approximation , which neglects all correlations .",
    "other studies neglected dominant contributions @xcite . the zero - temperature equation of state and , hence , the density profile calculated within the mean - field equation of state can not be expected to give a quantitatively correct description .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_mft ] , we derive the equation of the state of the above system within the mean - field approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec_linearresponse ] , we describe the fermion - mediated boson - boson interactions starting from linear - response theory . then , we develop a general perturbation formalism that accounts for the relevant correlations in the following four sections , secs .",
    "[ sec_fmedbb][sec_sum ] .",
    "our second - order calculation indicates that the instability associated with the spinodal decomposition is not a saddle point instability , as predicted by the mean - field model , but is caused by the divergence of the bec compressibility . in the low - density bec limit , we find that the perturbation treatment simplifies and we show that higher - order terms significantly lower the fermion density of the instability point and make the instability line dependent upon the bec density . from a partial summation of diagrams , we find an analytical expression for the equation of state and estimate the effect of other contributions .",
    "in this section , we describe the ground state of a dilute gas mixture of single - component fermionic atoms and single spin projection bosonic atoms .",
    "these fermions ( bosons ) , interacting via short - range atom - atom interaction potentials , are indistinguishable particles with mass @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , distributed in space with average particle density @xmath5 @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "we assume that the fermions are not paired into a superfluid , which may require the system to have a temperature above the critical temperature @xmath7 for mediated interaction induced fermion pairing @xcite . in practice , however , the @xmath7 for such fermion pairing @xcite is much lower than any other relevant energy scale so that there is a temperature regime in which for all practical purposes we can treat the unpaired fermion - bec mixture as a zero - temperature system with a normal fermion fluid . whether the @xmath8-wave pairing can be achieved may also depend on other factors : for instance , the inevitable loss processes that give a finite lifetime to the cold atom trap systems also heat up the system @xcite .",
    "this is a process that will compete with the formation of any ultralow - temperature phase of matter .    as mentioned before",
    ", the mean - field description commonly used in cold atom physics neglects correlations and fluctuations in the expression of all expectation values .",
    "accordingly , the interaction energy of this system , @xmath9 , is approximated as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the interaction strengths with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the fermion - boson and boson - boson scattering lengths , respectively .",
    "we assume that the effective boson - boson interactions are repulsive , i.e. , @xmath17 , in order to have the system be mechanically stable .",
    "mlmer @xcite pointed out that the trapped boson - fermion quantum gas mixtures can take on distinct spatial arrangements at low temperatures .",
    "when the fermion and boson particles mutually repel each other , @xmath18 , the mixtures can take on spatial configurations in which one region of space is occupied by only fermion particles , an arrangement akin to that of the phase - separated state in condensed @xmath0 mixtures .",
    "on the other hand , when the fermions and bosons attract each other , @xmath19 , the mutual attraction causes a density increase in the regions of fermion - boson overlap .",
    "if the attraction is sufficiently strong , the density increase leads to a collapsing instability @xcite that was observed experimentally by inguscio and co - workers @xcite .",
    "in the mixtures of repulsive fermion - boson interaction , viverit _ et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the zero - temperature phase diagram in the mean - field approximation .",
    "specifically , they discovered that the fermion - boson densities for an initially homogeneous mixture would take one of the following phases : ( a ) remain homogeneously mixed ( phase i ) , ( b ) spatially separate into spatial regions of all fermion - gas and spatial regions containing a fermion - bec mixture ( phase ii ) , and ( c ) separate into fermion - only and bec - only regions ( phase iii ) .",
    "they have determined the density regime boundaries of the phase diagram by equating the mean - field pressures as well as the mean - field chemical potentials of those particles that reside in both kinds of spatial regions .",
    "the pressures and chemical potentials follow from the zero - temperature equation of state : the ground - state energy of a homogeneous mixture .    the mean - field equation of state of a homogeneous mixture of @xmath20 fermions and @xmath21 bosons confined to a macroscopic volume @xmath22 , corresponding to average fermion and boson densities @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , is then equal to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fermi momentum @xmath27 . then , the fermion and boson chemical potentials , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , follow from eq .",
    "( [ mfeos ] ) , @xmath30 we obtain the same chemical potential equations by minimizing the free - energy function @xmath31 with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that the homogeneous mixture represents the physical ground state only if eqs .",
    "( [ mfchempot ] ) and ( [ mbchempot ] ) yield the global minimum of @xmath32 .",
    "this global minimum condition requires that the second derivatives of @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath20 be positive , i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "physically , these mathematical conditions imply that the compressibility of the fermion and boson systems should be positive , as the isothermal compressibility , @xmath36 , is inversely proportional to the chemical potential derivative , @xmath37   ^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 denotes the partial pressure experienced by gas @xmath39 ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) , and where the subscript @xmath42 indicates that the pressure derivative should be taken at constant temperature ( zero temperature in this case ) . in addition",
    ", the condition of a global minimum also implies that the extremum can not be a saddlepoint , which also requires @xmath43 .",
    "et al_. @xcite noted that when the fermion density exceeds a critical value , @xmath44 , where @xmath45   ^{3},\\ ] ] the extremum is a saddlepoint and the system can lower its energy by rolling down the saddlepoint in different @xmath46 directions in different spatial regions .",
    "the rolling down the saddlepoint  suggests a mechanism by which the mixture can phase - separate into regions of roughly equal size , i.e. , undergo spinodal decomposition .    on the phase diagram in the boson fermion density plane",
    ", the line of spinodal decomposition , @xmath47 , is located in the region with fermion densities above the phase i / ii boundary @xcite .",
    "thus , one might wonder how the mixture phase - separates if the densities of the initial homogeneous mixture were located in between the i / ii boundary line and the line of spinodal decomposition according to the mean - field description .",
    "we gain insight into this dynamics by plotting the free energy density @xmath48 as a function of the superfluid bec order parameter , which , if all bosons are bose - condensed , is related to the boson density as @xmath49 .",
    "actually , we find it useful to scale both the bec order parameter as well as the free energy density .",

    "we also define the scaled free energy by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",

    "( [ freeen ] ) generally exhibits @xmath60 dependency as shown in fig .",
    "[ freee ] .",
    "this shape of the landau free energy is associated with a first - order phase transition : the system can reduce its free energy by climbing or tunneling the free - energy barrier that separates two local minima . in ordinary finite- temperature ) first - order phase transitions , thermal activation locally pushes  the system over the barrier nucleating clumps of matter in the new phase .     as a function of @xmath60 @xmath61",
    "dotted line shows the stable system ( one global minimum ) and solid line shows the system that can undergo first - order phase transition ( one local minimum and one global minimum at the origin).,width=326,height=235 ]    if the temperature is too low to initiate thermal activation , the system can penetrate the barrier and nucleate by quantum - mechanical tunneling @xcite .",
    "the latter process , however , involves many - body tunneling , which the tunneling rate generally scales exponentially with the number of boson particles to be formed in each clump . a recent study @xcite found that the tunneling rate exceeds the experimental lifetime of the system except very close to the line of spinodal decomposition or for very strong fermion - boson interactions .",
    "otherwise , we can expect that at sufficiently low temperatures and below the line of spinodal decomposition , the fermion - boson mixture can remain in its homogeneous state for the duration of its experimental lifetime even if that homogeneous state represents a metastable equilibrium .",
    "we are also interested in what the mean - field approximation predicts for the phase - separation dynamics in the spinodal decomposition region , @xmath62 .",
    "we can understand the linear onset of the instability dynamics from the study of the collective oscillations @xcite .",
    "our studies @xcite revealed that two collective modes can be excited : a zero - sound mode with its sound velocity modified by boson - mediated fermion - fermion interactions , and a bec sound mode modified by the fermion mediated boson - boson interactions .",
    "as the system approaches the line of spinodal decomposition , the fermion - mediated interactions reduce the bec sound velocity .",
    "this velocity vanishes at the line and becomes imaginary above it , signaling the exponential growth of the long - wavelength modes .",
    "we have estimated the time scale on which the corresponding fluctuations ( which drive the onset of the phase dynamics ) grow @xcite .",
    "this analysis suggests that the fermion - mediated interactions make the bec unstable .",
    "the vanishing of the sound velocity at the line of decomposition also suggests the divergence of the boson compressibility , as the compressibility is inversely proportional to the square of the sound velocity .",
    "however , the mean - field equation of state does not exhibit this behavior .",
    "the mean field also fails to include polaron effects : the mass of a fermion particle immersed in a phonon - fluid can be significantly altered by its interactions with that fluid @xcite .",
    "the importance of polaron effects was illustrated by a recent study @xcite that showed a single impurity ( a distinguishable atom immersed in a bec ) can self - localize into a small polaron - like state .",
    "the rest of the paper deals with these problems by showing that the correlation physics which we will include in the calculation of the equation of state does lead to a divergence of the boson compressibility .",
    "the perturbation treatment that we develop in this paper includes polaron effects .",
    "in this section , we derive the fermion - mediated interaction effects up to lowest order by applying linear - response theory to a mean - field state . writing the energy response of the homogeneous many - body system as the small - amplitude variation of the boson and fermion static densities ,",

    "in this section , we determine the fermion - mediated boson - boson interactions using a perturbation approach .",
    "two assumptions were made .",
    "one is that the mixture is homogeneous , i.e. , the average densities @xmath111 and @xmath112 are position independent , and the other is that the boson - boson scattering length , @xmath16 , is sufficiently small to ensure that the gas parameter @xmath113 so that the bec is dilute and well - described by the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "the zeroth order corresponds to the limit @xmath114 while @xmath12 remains constant .",

    "similarly , the excited states of the zeroth - order hamiltonian are product states of the zeroth order fermion ground - state and the bec ground state ( or alternatively particle - hole states and boson quasiparticle states ) .",

    "the rules for translating each diagram to a numerical factor are straightforward , so we briefly describe the procedure here . in our case of a homogeneous system ,",
    "the particle and quasiparticle excitations correspond to good momentum quantum numbers and we assign momentum labels @xmath161 to the fermion lines and @xmath162 to the boson lines , ensuring conservation of momentum at each @xmath158 .",
    "next , we divide the vertical ` time ' axis into separate time intervals between the different interaction @xmath158 points and determine the propagator energy denominators to multiply .",
    "converting the remaining sums over boson @xmath163 and fermion @xmath164 momenta to dimensionless integrals introduces dimensionless expansion parameters @xmath165 and @xmath166 that quantify the relative importance of fermion and boson excitation induced correlations .",
    "then , we assign a single factor @xmath167 of the @xmath118 operator to each of the momentum summations that remain after enforcing conservation of momentum , and multiply and divide by @xmath168 for the boson sums and by @xmath169 for the fermion momentum sums .    after taking the infinite system limit @xmath170 , we introduce dimensionless momentum variables @xmath171 for bosons , where @xmath132 is the bec coherence length , and @xmath172 , where @xmath26 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath173",
    ". then integrate over fermion momenta , and write the zeroth - order fermion and boson chemical potentials as @xmath169 and @xmath168 , respectively .    for boson momentum integrals",
    "we obtain @xmath174 where @xmath166 denotes the boson expansion parameter @xmath175 and for the fermion momentum sum , @xmath176 where @xmath177 which plays the role of fermion expansion parameter .",
    "the energy denominators obtained in this procedure contain fermion and boson excitation energies .",
    "so , first , we make the denominators positive valued , introducing a @xmath178 factor for each propagator , and verify that particle excitation energies appear with a positive sign and hole excitations with a negative sign .",
    "then , we make the propagators dimensionless by bringing out an energy scaling factor , @xmath169 or @xmath168 , @xmath179 for those propagators that contain both boson and fermion excitation energies , we have to choose which energy scale to use . scaling by the boson chemical potential , we obtain the following expression for the propagator that corresponds to the excited state with one bec phonon excited of momentum @xmath180 , a fermion particle excitation of momentum @xmath181 , and a fermion hole excitation of momentum @xmath182 , @xmath183 where @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 .",
    "hence , the mixed fermion - boson propagators give rise to dimensionless integrands that depend on the mass ratio @xmath187 as well as on the @xmath188 parameter that compares the bec and fermion lengthy scales : @xmath189 .",
    "we now include the contributions that stem from the interaction matrix elements .",
    "each fermion loop contributes a factor @xmath20 , each boson loop contributes @xmath21 , and each boson line that connects two vertices and carries a momentum @xmath163 gives rise to a factor @xmath190 each fermion hole line of momentum @xmath164 gives a factor @xmath191 , where @xmath192 denotes the zero - temperature fermi - dirac distribution function . in scaled momentum units , @xmath193 where @xmath194 represents the usual heaviside function : @xmath195 if @xmath196 and @xmath197 if @xmath198 .",
    "likewise , each upward fermion line of momentum @xmath199 gives the factor @xmath200 associated with a particle fermion excitation .",
    "finally , we have to specify how to take the infinite system ( long - wavelength ) limit associated with those diagrams that have loops . from the calculation of the fermion - mediated boson - boson interaction in the preceding section",
    ", we deduce the following rule : we assign a fictitious momentum @xmath201 with each fermion loop and a momentum @xmath202 for the boson loops , conserve momentum at each vertex with this additional momentum , and then take the long - wavelength limits @xmath203 , @xmath204 at the end of the calculation .    in the next two sections",
    ", we use the procedure described above for calculating the equation of state and then analyze the results .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the first- and second - order contributions to the many - particle ground - state energy of a homogeneous fermion - bec mixture .",
    "below , we describe the numerical contributions of each diagram shown in figs .  [ diagram]@xmath205-[diagram]@xmath206 . the derivation of the full expressions is beyond the scope of this paper and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the analysis of this section serves to reveal trends , such as the vanishing of specific diagrams in the low - density bec limit @xmath207 in which bec fluctuation - induced correlations can be neglected .",
    "much of the challenge in calculating the numerical contributions goes into making judicious choices in dealing with the different ways that the rules can be applied .",
    "the labeling of the fermion and boson lines with momenta can be carried out in different ways .",
    "for instance , in calculating the contribution of diagram @xmath208 , the bubble diagram with intersecting phonon line , one can either assign a boson momentum @xmath87 to the phonon line and a momentum @xmath209 to the fermion particle line or one can assign a momentum @xmath210 to the fermion particle line so that the phonon line acquires a momentum @xmath211 .",
    "the first choice results in an integral over a fermion momentum and an integral over a boson momentum , whereas the second choice results in a double fermion momentum integral . also , one can scale the mixed fermion - boson energy denominators in the propagators either by the zeroth - order fermion or by the zeroth - order boson chemical potential .",
    "neither of these choices affects the final result , but they can obscure common factors and common limits of different diagrams .",
    "for instance , diagrams @xmath205 and @xmath208 give contributions that are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign in the limit @xmath212 .",
    "we now list and describe the contributions of diagrams @xmath213 . the diagram @xmath205 describes fermion - mediated boson - boson interactions @xmath214 obtained earlier in secs .

    "@xmath208 and @xmath206 play a special role .",
    "diagram @xmath208 corresponds to the direct part of the boson - mediated interaction,@xmath215 and part of diagram @xmath206 gives the exchange interaction contribution .",
    "specifically , diagram @xmath206 corresponds to the sum of the second - order polaron energy shift experienced by the fermions caused by their interaction with the surrounding bec phonon fluid and the exchange part of the boson - mediated fermion - fermion interaction , @xmath216 in a static approximation of the boson - mediated interaction , the fermions attract each other via an attractive yukawa potential of range @xmath131 . while the static approximation is not always valid , the effective interaction does have an effective range of order @xmath131 so that the @xmath188 parameter quantifies the ratio of the mediated interaction range to the average fermion - fermion distance .",
    "the exchange interaction then depends on the @xmath188 parameter and the mass ratio ( which affects the region in which the static approximation is valid ) , @xmath217 the dimensionless exchange function @xmath218 introduced in the above equation satisfies @xmath219 , which ensures that the exchange and direct contributions cancel in the limit that the interaction range is much smaller than the average fermion - fermion distance , as required by the pauli principle .",
    "@xmath220 denotes the modification to the kinetic energy of ideal fermions with their dispersion altered by the interaction with the surrounding bec , as described by second - order perturbation theory .",
    "this polaron  contribution is often well described by a zero - momentum energy shift and an effective mass value . for the contact interaction ,",
    "the second - order polaron contribution has to be renormalized .",
    "the resulting energy shift experienced by a single fermion particle is of order @xmath221 .",
    "the summation over fermion occupation numbers gives a many - body contribution @xmath222 which can be rewritten in the energy units of the boson - mediated interactions using @xmath223 , @xmath224 where the remaining @xmath188 dependence is absorbed by the dimensionless polarization function @xmath225 .",
    "note that the scale of the boson - mediated fermion - fermion interaction energy per fermion particle is @xmath226,whereas the scale of the fermion - mediated boson - boson interactions per boson particle is@xmath227 this also implies that the ratio of the boson - mediated fermion energy scale to the fermion - mediated boson interaction energy is @xmath228   \\left (   \\lambda_{bf}/\\lambda _ { bb}\\right )   = ( 8/3\\pi)\\alpha^{2}$ ] . in fig .",

    "we could have suspected the vanishing of the diagram @xmath206 contribution as its expression involves a summation over a boson momentum so that we may expect at least a factor @xmath166 .",
    "however , the @xmath188 dependence of the dimensionless integrals complicates the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical results shown in fig .  [ exeped ] confirm the naive expectation of vanishing energy contribution in the dilute bec limit .",
    "this finding indicates a general trend , namely that those diagrams with bec - phonon momenta that are summed over vanish in the low - density bec limit .",
    "we can expect the diagrammatic analysis to simplify considerably in the dilute bec region .",
    "even though we consider a low bec density region , part of this region displays interesting many - body behavior as the fermion - mediated boson - boson attraction competes with the usual contact - interaction boson - boson repulsion .",
    "the general diagrammatic analysis becomes unwieldy as the values of the coupling parameters increase .",
    "the resulting complexity is a common failing of diagrammatic treatments , often limiting their usefulness in describing strongly interacting systems .",
    "fortunately , in the fermion - bec mixture , a significant simplification occurs in the low - density bec limit . for that system",
    ", we define the low bec density regime as the limit in which the bec is dilute with respect to the usual ( contact ) boson - boson interactions , @xmath113 , and in which the bosons do not significantly affect the fermion particle properties ( altering their effective mass , for instance , or including vertex corrections in the description of effective fermion - boson interactions ) .",

    "more generally , diagrams in which phonon momenta have to be summed over can be discarded in this low - density bec limit .",
    "a large class of diagrams is still relevant , however , namely those diagrams in which fermion bubbles  ( particle - hole pairs ) are connected by phonon propagators with momenta of vanishing value in the long - wavelength limit implied in loops .",
    "this is the case for the diagrams that we will refer to as linear  diagrams  diagrams with two loops in which one can move linearly from one loop to the other in only one way , crossing all the interaction vertex signs ( @xmath158 ) while passing alternating fermion - bubble and phonon segments .",
    "an important subclass of the linear diagrams is the stretched diagrams in which the loops are placed at the earliest and at the latest time and in which the bubble - phonon segments proceed from the earliest to the latest time in a time - ordered fashion , as shown in fig .",

    "we expect that the main contributions to the bec compressibility value stem from the diagrams @xmath249 of fig .",
    "[ highdiagram ] and their folded versions .",
    "the lowest - order folded @xmath249 diagrams are folded version of the second diagram of the @xmath256 series  the diagram that has two boson loops , two fermion particle - hole bubbles and one phonon propagator .",
    "these fourth - order folded diagrams contribute negative terms to the equation of state and would tend to further lower the value of the fermion density of diverging boson compressibility below @xmath265 . as their stretched counterpart , they contribute terms that are proportional to @xmath270 and to @xmath271 .",

    "we then showed that in the low bec density limit , the diagrammatic analysis simplifies to a study of the linear diagrams , of which the stretched  diagram subclass can be summed , giving an expansion parameter @xmath254 that quantifies the magnitude of the long - wavelength fermion - mediated interaction relative to the regular short - range boson - boson interactions .",
    "the resulting equation of state yields a value of the fermion density at which the boson compressibility diverges that is slightly higher than half corresponding to a factor @xmath281 of @xmath44 .",
    "a further exploration of the remaining linear diagrams shows that the folded  diagrams contribute terms that are higher order in @xmath254 , and we speculate that these contributions will further lower the fermion density at which the mechanical phase - separation instability would set in , giving a critical value of the fermion density that would now depend on the boson density as well .",
    "in addition to revealing the inadequacy of the mean - field description near phase separation , these studies have also identified the fermion - mediated interaction as the cause of the mechanical instability associated with the spinodal decomposition of the fermion - boson mixtures . in a general context",
