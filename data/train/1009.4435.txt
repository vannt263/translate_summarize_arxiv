    "in the recent works @xcite , an unconventional effect was discovered . in a dielectric disk - shaped resonator placed in liquid @xmath0he , the azimuth ( @xmath1-)modes were excited .",
    "these modes are of the `` whispering - gallery '' type and represent a superposition of standing and running resonance electromagnetic ( em ) waves of the shf range in a narrow frequency interval . at the roton frequency @xmath2 the supernarrow absorption line with the width @xmath3",
    "was observed in the shf spectrum of the resonator .",
    "this width is by six orders less than that of a roton peak measured in neutron experiments and is comparable with the width of line in the mssbauer effect .",
    "it was assumed in @xcite that the line is related to the van hove singularity caused by a high density of states of plane ( p- ) rotons near the roton minimum of the dispersion curve . in this case , however , one is faced with the problem to satisfy the momentum conservation law , since the p - roton momentum is greater than the momentum of a p - photon with the same energy by six orders .",
    "therefore , it was supposed @xcite that the excess momentum of a p - roton is transferred to helium as a whole .    to clarify this and other points ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the probability of the creation of a roton and the widths and the forms of lines for various possible processes , and then to choose a process explaining the experiment .",
    "it is necessary to take into account that the em field of a disk - shaped resonator has the circular ( c- ) symmetry and is concentrated only near the disk according to measurements @xcite and the theory @xcite .",
    "since namely the em field induces the transition , the latter must be characterized by the c - symmetry . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a phonon near a disk possesses also the c - symmetry .",
    "therefore , we assume that the narrow line corresponds to the creation of a c - roton by the em field of the resonator .",
    "below , we will find the probability of this process and the width of the corresponding absorption line .",
    "a number of results required for calculations was obtained in @xcite ; formulas ( n ) from that work will be denoted here by ( n@xmath4 ) .",
    "a part of the results of the present work was briefly published in @xcite .",
    "to calculate the line width , it is necessary to know the probability of the c - photon @xmath5 c - phonon process .",
    "no problems concerning the conservation laws appear for this process , because both c - photon and c - phonon have no momentum , but have angular momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively @xcite .",
    "moreover , the condition @xmath8 is easily satisfied .",
    "as will be seen , the field of the resonator contains @xmath9 photons with close frequencies . at such occupation number ,",
    "the photon field can be considered as an external classical perturbing harmonic field with frequency @xmath10 acting on helium .",
    "we now calculate the probability of the creation of a c - phonon by this field .",
    "the width of the azimuth mode , on which the roton line is observed , is about 2.5mhz , the line width @xmath11mhz , and the frequency @xmath12 ghz .",
    "it is seen that the mode width is very small as compared with the frequency ; therefore , the latter can be considered constant .",
    "it is worth noting that , while calculating the transition amplitude , we can take no care of the conservation laws .",
    "they are satisfied automatically ( if a transition contradicts some conservation law , this will manifest itself in the disagreement of the symmetries of the initial and final states , and the amplitude will become equal to zero ) .",
    "the probability ( per unit time ) of the creation of a c - phonon in he ii due to the action of the em field of a resonator is @xcite @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the phase volumes of all nuclei and all electrons , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the wave functions ( wfs ) of the initial and final states of helium , respectively , @xmath19 is the energy of a c - phonon , and @xmath20 .",
    "the explicit formula for @xmath21 follows from the perturbation operator @xmath22 if the wavelength @xmath23 of the em field is much more than the size of the system , then the problem is solved in the dipole approximation @xcite . in our case , this approximation is not suitable , since the system size exceeds @xmath23 by one order .",
    "in addition , a photon is spent on the excitation of fluid helium as a whole , i.e. on the creation of a c - phonon which is related to the motion of atoms as united objects , rather than on the excitation of electron shells of a single atom or many atoms .",
    "therefore , we will use a general approach , by considering the action of the em field directly on the charged particles in an atom , i.e. , on electrons and the nucleus .",
    "but the atoms interact with one another . as a result",
    ", the em field creates the collective excitation , a phonon which is electrically neutral as a whole .",
    "it should be noted that a sound wave is associated with a variable concentration gradient . in this case , a variable local electric field arises in the interatomic space , since helium atoms polarize one another @xcite .",
    "however , this gives only a negligible correction to the effect . for a charge particle in the em field",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the charge and the radius - vector of a particle , respectively .",
    "the term with @xmath28 induces two - photon transitions which will not be considered here .",
    "the field @xmath29 should be real and can be presented in the form @xmath30 the quantity @xmath31 is calculated in @xcite , formula ( 6@xmath4 ) . since we are interesting in the field @xmath29 in helium , we set @xmath32 in ( 6@xmath4 ) . as a result , we obtain @xmath33 , i.e. the divergence is determined by the field @xmath34 , i.e. the time - independent part of @xmath29 .",
    "it can be always set to zero , by adding a gradient of the corresponding function to @xmath35 in this case , the measurable quantities @xmath36 and @xmath37 are not changed .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 . in what follows ,",
    "we omit index 0 in @xmath40 ( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "so , we have @xmath41 consider the set of he ii atoms in the field @xmath29 .",
    "an atom of @xmath0he consists of the nucleus with the charge @xmath42 and two electrons , each possessing the charge @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , for he ii , we have @xmath44 here , @xmath45 are coordinates of the nucleus of the @xmath46-th atom , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are coordinates of the electrons of this atom , @xmath49 is the nucleus mass of @xmath0he atom , and @xmath50 is the electron mass .    to calculate @xmath51 we need to know the wfs @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "let the initial state characterized by the wf @xmath17 be the ground state of helium , and let the final state with @xmath18 be the ground state plus one c - phonon .",
    "then @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the wf of all electrons , and @xmath54 is the wf of all nuclei of helium atoms .",
    "the modern microscopic models describe the properties of he ii well enough . according to them ,",
    "a helium atom is a very elastic object .",
    "therefore , we can consider with a good accuracy that the electron shell of each atom follows the nucleus without inertia and is not deformed by the interaction with neighboring atoms . in this case , @xmath55 coincides with @xmath56 written as a function of the coordinates of atoms , and the electron part looks as @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "for the wf of the ground state of @xmath0he atom , we use the well - known one - parameter approximation with @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) . in reality , the electron shells of atoms are perturbed by neighbors and as a result are somewhat deformed @xcite .",
    "these deformations are `` directed '' to the atom , with which the interaction occurs .",
    "since the adjacent atoms surround the given atom from all sides and chaotically on the average , the polarizations induced by them cancel one another to a significant degree . as a result",
    ", the mean polarization of an atom in he ii turns out small , @xmath62 @xcite , though it is greater by one order of magnitude than the polarization induced by a single atom located at the mean interatomic distance @xmath63 .",
    "the literature presents the assertions that the presence of large - amplitude zero oscillations of he ii with the amplitude @xmath64 implies that the electron shell of a helium atom is strongly deformed and `` smeared '' over several interatomic distances .",
    "however , this should not be accepted : zero oscillations mean only that , due to the strong interatomic interaction , the helium atoms move with a large ( even at @xmath65 ) mean velocity , which leads to a small density of helium and exhausts the condensate .",
    "but the electron shells of atoms are deformed slightly in this case , as follows from the smallness of @xmath66 .",
    "we will neglect these deformations and apply formula ( [ a13 ] ) .    for the wf of a state with a single c - phonon",
    ", we use the formula @xcite @xmath67 in view of it , we obtain @xmath68 let us take into account that @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71\\psi_{0}^{el}.                                        \\label{a18}\\ ] ] then @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74      we note that the matrix element @xmath76 in ( [ a1 ] ) is constructed on the basis of the wfs @xmath17 and @xmath18 not containing the time factor ( the latter is included into the @xmath77-function ) . in formula ( 50@xmath4 ) for @xmath78",

    "thus , a resonator creates c - phonons mainly of two `` extreme '' types : almost completely circular and almost plane .",
    "the high probability of the creation of c - phonons with an almost plane structure is a somewhat unexpected result . at the same time , it is clear that the completely plane phonons can not be created due to the angular momentum conservation law : a phonon must possess a certain `` twist '' ( @xmath269 , @xmath270 ) in order to carry away the angular momentum of a c - photon .",
    "as was mentioned above , the spectrum of the shf emission of a disk resonator contains the very narrow absorption line at the roton frequency ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "let the line width be the distance between the points , which located on both sides from the line center , and for which the intensity of a signal is about 0.8 of the background one ( the signal far from the line ) .",
    "then it follows from the experiment @xcite that the line width is about @xmath272 at @xmath273 and decreases , at lower @xmath274 to the resolving power of a spectroscope ( @xmath275 ) .",
    "moreover , the width stops to decrease at @xmath276 and approaches a constant @xmath275 .",
    "the minimum experimental temperature @xmath277 , but formula ( [ e37 ] ) is applicable , if there are no c - rotons in the initial state of helium , i.e. , at @xmath65 . because the width does not depend on @xmath278 already at @xmath276",
    ", we may assume that the width at @xmath65 is the same as that at @xmath277 .",
    "the creation of a c - phonon ( or a c - roton ) is caused by the c - photon @xmath5 c - phonon transition . in order to calculate its probability",
    ", we should divide @xmath245 ( [ e37 ] ) by the number of c - photons in a resonator , @xmath279 we can calculate the latter by dividing the total energy of the em field of the resonator , @xmath280 by the energy of a c - photon , @xmath281 . since the field outside of the disk is weak , we will consider only the field inside the disk determined by formulas ( 17@xmath4 ) and ( 18@xmath4 ) . since @xmath282 ^ 2 \\approx 2\\cdot 10^{-3}r_{d}^{2 }         \\label{a54}\\ ] ] and @xmath283 , we can obtain @xmath284 ,       \\label{a55 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the small terms contributing to @xmath285 are omitted . using ( [ a55 ] ) , it is easy to evaluate the total energy and the number of c - photons in the pumping band ( @xmath286 ) for the roton mode ( @xmath287 ) and the roton frequency : @xmath288 @xmath289    in a vicinity of the roton minimum , we have @xmath290 with @xmath291 , @xmath292 .",

    "we now determine the absorption line width . to this end , we consider properties of the resonator . in the experiment @xcite , the pumping signal with the frequency band @xmath296 and the power @xmath297w was firstly switched - on .",
    "but , as a result of losses , the resonator received @xmath298w .",
    "the resonator accumulates and amplifies the pumping signal , but , in this case , the energy losses in the resonator increase also , until a stationary equilibrium state is established . in this state ,",
    "the losses in the resonator on the emission are equal to the pumping . in other words ,",
    "the condition of equilibrium for the em field of the resonator with frequencies in the pumping band is the equality of the pumping energy flow and the losses : @xmath299 where @xmath300 and @xmath301 are , respectively , the number of c - photons in the resonator and the mean emission time of a c - photon by the resonator ( obviously , it is also the period of renewal of em modes of the resonator ) . by the value of @xmath302 we can estimate the electrical signal formed by an antenna catching photons emitted by the resonator as @xmath303w .",
    "it follows from the distribution of the stationary em field of the resonator @xcite that this field induces in the antenna the signal @xmath304w , weaker by 13 orders . in other words , the signal generated by the antenna is due to photons emitted by the resonator , rather than to the stationary em field of the latter .",
    "when the frequency of the em field approaches the roton one , then , according to ( [ a57 ] ) , the probability of the emission of c - rotons by the resonator becomes large .",
    "we now consider the frequency interval @xmath305 , which is much less than the line width and the pumping band but contains a macroscopic number of quanta .",
    "if the emission of c - rotons occurs , then the condition of equilibrium for the band @xmath306 takes the form @xmath307 where @xmath308 is a duration of the emission of a c - roton by c - photon of the resonator , and @xmath309 is the number of c - rotons emitted for a time interval @xmath310 by c - photons from the band @xmath306 . in this case , the losses of the resonator are separated into the channels of emission of c - photons and c - rotons . respectively ,",
    "the flow of emitted c - photons decreases , which is manifested in the resonator spectrum as the absorption . as was mentioned above",
    ", the signal is equal to @xmath311 of the background one on the edge of lines .",
    "hence , @xmath312 of the losses of the resonator are transferred into c - rotons , whereas @xmath311 pass into c - photons .",
    "thus , each c - photon of the resonator in the frequency band @xmath306 for the time @xmath301 emits a c - photon with a probability of 0.8 and a c - roton with a probability of 0.2 .",
    "this yields @xmath313 , which allows us to write the following condition for the line edge : @xmath314 relations ( [ a56 ] ) , ( [ eq1 ] ) yield @xmath315s , which corresponds to the experimental value @xmath316s . using the last value of @xmath301 and ( [ lin ] ) , we obtain @xmath317 for the line edge : @xmath318 , which is only by a factor of 1.5 less than the theoretical value of @xmath317 ( [ a57 ] ) .    k. @xmath319  experiment @xcite , dotted line  theory ( by the present work ) .",

    "at @xmath322 , the amplitude of the former is given by the formula @xmath323 .",
    "in this case , the error of the line width is about one order ; it related to the approximate character of the solutions for the wf of a c - phonon ( not completely correct consideration of boundary conditions ) and for the em field of the resonator , as well as to the neglect of a deviation of a symmetry of the system far from the disk ( antenna , container s wall , etc . ) from the cylindrical symmetry . as is seen from fig .  1",
    ", the theoretical line corresponds approximately to the experimental one by width , but does not by shape .",
    "the density of states @xmath324 is high in the region above the energy @xmath325 of a roton ( @xmath326 at @xmath327 ) .",
    "below @xmath328 no roton states are present , and the density of states decreases sharply to a value corresponding to the linear phonon curve : @xmath329 .",
    "therefore , for the c - photon @xmath5 c - roton transition , the line must sharply fall on the side of lower frequencies , whereas the experimental line is almost symmetric .",
    "this difference means that the process is more complicated and involves at least two particles , rather than one particle ( c - photon @xmath5 c - roton ) , as was accepted above .",
    "in particular , one more c - phonon can be created , or a part of the angular momentum of a c - photon can be absorbed by the disk .",
    "we hope to clarify the mechanism in the future investigations .",
    "it is necessary also to take into account that a spreading of the c - roton energy which is due to the interaction between quasiparticles can also contribute to the line width .",
    "however , this leads to a very large line width of the order of magnitude of the width @xmath330 in neutron experiments . this value is larger by 6 orders than the width of the narrow shf line and by 4 orders than the mode width .",
    "therefore , this spreading can not be observed for a single mode , but it is revealed as the `` pedestal '' ( base ) on many modes @xcite .",
    "the number of photons approaching the receiver is diminished not only due to the creation of c - rotons by the field of the resonator , but also due to their creation by c - photons already emitted by the resonator . the time - of - flight of these photons to the receiver is @xmath331 which is less by 5 orders than the duration of the emission of a c - roton by a photon of the resonator . in this case , the probabilities of the emission of a c - roton for a standing photon of the resonator and a running photon are of the same order , because a standing c - photon is simply a superposition of two radial c - photons propagating toward each other .",
    "therefore , the line is formed not due to the absorption of running photons , but , as we have assumed , due to the absorption of `` standing '' photons of the resonator .",
    "while calculating formula ( [ a57 ] ) , we used the solution for the em field @xcite , for which the sewing in the corner region ( @xmath332 ) is approximate . in this region ,",
    "the em field is weak .",
    "but , nevertheless , it influences the value of @xmath317 . to evaluate this influence , we calculated the probability @xmath317 for two other distributions of the em field in the corner region : @xmath333 and @xmath334 $ ] , @xmath335 .",
    "the latter can be sewed with solutions in other regions , but it does not completely satisfy the equation . moreover , if we use @xmath336 instead of @xmath337 , then the equation is satisfied , but the sewing can not be executed .",
    "the value of @xmath317 for such solutions differs from ( [ a57 ] ) by several times ; therefore , @xmath317 is not very sensitive to the sewing .",
    "the analysis indicates that it is of importance to correctly set the solution in the corner region near the joint with adjacent regions , and it is not so important in bulk .",
    "solution ( 32@xmath4 ) , ( 33@xmath4 ) satisfies this condition , so that its use is justified .",
    "as was mentioned above , the probability ( [ a57 ] ) of the c - photon @xmath5 c - roton process grows strongly at @xmath338 , i.e. , near the points of an extremum of the dispersion curve @xmath339 .",
    "this peculiarity explains why the narrow line is observed namely at the roton frequency and predicts the possibility to find one more line at the frequency of the maxon maximum , @xmath340 @xcite ( up to now , the frequencies @xmath341 were studied ) .",
    "let us substitute the maxon parameters ( @xmath342 , @xmath343 , @xmath344 ) in ( [ a57 ] ) , and let us take into account that , in the denominator , the number @xmath345 , and , according to ( 19@xmath4 ) and ( 20@xmath4 ) , it should be @xmath346 for the resonance mode .",
    "we obtain @xmath347 .",
    "thus , without regard for an additional factor ( see above ) , we have that if @xmath301 is approximately identical for the maxon and roton lines , then the width of the maxon line must be larger by a factor of 1.7 ( at @xmath65 ) than the width of the roton line .",
    "the peculiarity at @xmath338 is well known in solid - state physics as the van hove singularity . at @xmath348 the states of c -",
    "rotons falling in the small given energy interval are strongly concentrated . respectively",
    ", the transition probability in this energy interval sharply increases . in crystals ,",
    "the narrow lines of light absorption @xcite and neutron scattering @xcite were registered a lot of times .",
    "however , the width of the latter is larger by several orders than those of shf lines in helium and corresponds to the pedestal .",
    "thus , the narrow shf line in helium is related to the van hove singularity , like the lines of crystals , but its widening is caused by another mechanism .    in neutron experiments with liquid helium , the analogous very narrow peaks must be observed on the scattering curve @xmath349 at the frequencies of the roton and maxon extrema .",
    "however , the high error of neutron measurements ( @xmath350 ) does not allow one to register these peaks .",
    "in addition to the processes considered above , one more channel is possible : c - photon @xmath5 p - phonon + the transfer of a momentum to the disk and the transfer of an angular momentum to the disk or for the creation of a vortex rotating around the disk .",
    "such processes must be less probable , since the greater the number of quasiparticles participating in a process , the less is the probability of the process .",
    "moreover , what is more important , the overlapping of the wave functions of the em field and a p - phonon is slight due to different symmetries .    in order to explain the appearance of the narrow line of absorption",
    ", the authors of work @xcite proposed to consider the following process : p - photon @xmath5 p - roton + the transfer of a momentum to helium as a whole . in our opinion",
    ", the transfer of a momentum to the disk can be more probable in such an approach , since the disk is a tougher system as compared with helium .",
    "the approach with a plane photon and a plane phonon is the main alternative to the above - considered process with c - rotons .",
    "but the latter is , apparently , more probable by two reasons .",
    "+ 1 ) as was mentioned above , the line is formed by the stationary em field of the resonator , rather than by running photons .",
    "the em field outside of the resonator can be represented as a superposition of plane waves ( wave packets ) .",
    "but the total em field of the resonator is a sum of c - photons localized outside and inside the disk ( see @xcite ) . at the creation of a c - roton",
    ", a c - photon disappears _ as a whole _ inside and outside of the disk .",
    "but , due to different values of @xmath351 of helium and the disk , such a c - photon can not be presented in the form of a superposition of photons which are plane in both helium and the disk ( a photon is not plane or in helium , or in the disk ) .",
    "in other words , we must be based in the input equations on the _ circular _ field of the resonator .",
    "in addition , the properties of this field are unlike those of plane waves , because the field of the resonator sharply drops with increase in the distance to the resonator .",
    "+ 2 ) in addition , the approach with p - photons requires the expansion of the field in multipoles . here , the main contribution is given by the term with the dipole moment ( dm ) @xmath352 of a roton .",
    "it was assumed in work @xcite that such a stationary dm arises in a roton due to the mutual polarization of atoms , and the probability of the p - photon @xmath5 p - phonon transition is proportional to @xmath353 .",
    "it was also proposed in @xcite that a vortex ring possesses an intrinsic dm . however , both quasiparticles create the reciprocal motion of atoms : a part of atoms moves forward , but the similar part moves backward . in this case",
    ", the separated direction is set by the velocity of a quasiparticle .",
    "therefore , the appearance of a dm is related to the asymmetry of a quasiparticle relative to the forward - backward directions .",
    "the question about the presence of such an asymmetry can be clarified with the help of the following reasoning ( which belongs to yu.v .",
    "shtanov ) . by definition ,",
    "the stationary dm of a quasiparticle is equal to @xmath354 where @xmath355 is the wf of a quasiparticle .",
    "let us make inversion of time @xmath356 .",
    "in this case , we have @xcite @xmath357 , and dm ( [ vr ] ) is not changed . but",
    "the dm must be directed along the velocity of a quasiparticle , i.e. , it should change the sign .",
    "this implies that the dm is zero .",
    "it was considered in @xcite that , by the cpt - theorem , the charges also change their signs at @xmath356 , which gives @xmath358 .",
    "however , the change @xmath356 in the equation can be performed formally without any connection with the time arrow .",
    "then the charges conserve their signs at @xmath359 and the dm turns out zero .",
    "the real quasiparticle is a wave pocket , but it is clearly that in this case @xmath360 also .",
    "such a consideration is not valid if the state of a quasiparticle is degenerate . in other words , at given @xmath361 and @xmath362 there are the states with dms @xmath363 and @xmath364 which can transit to each other at @xmath365 however , we have no reasons to consider that a roton or a ring has such a degeneration . for @xmath366 there appears another possibility , if the reflected state is unstable and transits in a stable one with the inverse dm .",
    "this internal irreversibility can be related to the ordering of deformations of the electron shells of atoms induced by the interaction with neighbors . for clearness",
    ", we note that this is similar to a flag on a moving car .",
    "such a flag points out always the direction opposite to one of the motion . at @xmath367",
    "we obtain a flag indicating the direction of motion , i.e. , we obtain the unstable state . a similar structure of a ring or a roton is possible in principle .",
    "but it is improbable , especially for a roton representing reciprocal oscillations of the density .",
    "it is of importance that such a change of the symmetry , like that at @xmath368 , will happen at the reflection of a quasiparticle from the wall . at each reflection ,",
    "the quasiparticle must loss energy .",
    "hence , it will be unstable .",
    "such an instability is possible for rings , and it could explain why the rings are not discovered in the spectrum of quasiparticles or by the contribution to the heat capacity till now .",
    "but such an instability seems impossible for phonons and rotons .",
    "thus , a roton has no stationary dm .",
    "this is also the case for a ring , most probably .",
    "this reasoning implies that , while explaining the narrow line , the circular symmetry of the problem must be taken into account already in the input equations .",
    "as is known from the general theorems of quantum mechanics , a many - particle system located in a finite volume possesses a discrete energy spectrum .",
    "liquid @xmath0he in a vessel is the system of this kind .",
    "the energy levels of he  ii can be determined from the wf of he  ii calculated for the zero boundary conditions . from here , it is obvious that the real energy spectrum of he  ii is not a landau continuous curve , but it is a collection of separate disconnected points very densely lying on this curve . according to ( [ i42a ] ) , ( [ i42b ] ) , the observed roton line @xcite consists of @xmath370 individual roton lines .",
    "if the experiment will be executed with a film of helium @xmath371 in thickness , the distances between lines increases by 6 orders of magnitude , and they will become resolvable . in this case , instead of a single roton line , we will measure many lines in the wide range of the frequencies : @xmath372 .",
    "thus , it will be possible to observe for the first time the line spectrum of a fluid consisting of a huge number of discrete lines , like the spectrum of an atom .",
    "it is only necessary that the intensities of lines be sufficiently high .",
    "however , if the resonator disk is only covered by a helium film , no lines will be observed .",
    "indeed , by ( [ e37 ] ) , the intensities of lines will be of the same order of magnitude as those for a thick layer of helium @xcite .",
    "but the line registered for such a layer consists of @xmath370 individual lines which are too weak to be observed separately . to resolve them",
    ", one needs to increase their intensity by 4 - 5 orders of magnitudes .",
    "this is a task for future studies .",
    "the experiment @xcite revealed one more unusual effect : as the power @xmath373 of a heat gun increases , the amplitude @xmath374 of the roton absorption peak decreases , and this occurs stepwise .",
    "this fact testifies to the `` quantization '' of the roton line amplitude .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that this effect can be related to the quantization of the azimuth velocity @xmath375 ( around the resonator ) , but the nature of this connection is not clear yet .",
    "since the growth of @xmath374 means a decrease in the number of c - rotons created by shf - photons , we assume that each step of @xmath374 means a decrease in the number of created c - rotons by some integer .    in he ii near the resonator ,",
    "two competing processes occur : c - photons create c - rotons and _ vice versa_. in this case , a c - roton can transit only in a c - photon with the same energy and the same @xmath1 . from the state @xmath376 with @xmath300 c",
    "- photons and @xmath377 c - rotons , the transition in two following states is possible : _ i _ ) the state @xmath378 , if a c - roton creates a c - photon ; _ ii _ ) the state @xmath379 , if a c - photon creates a c - roton .    since circular photons and rotons are bosons , we can associate the creation operators with them . within the formalism of secondary quantization for bosons , we obtain the transition probability ( _ i _ ) @xmath380 for ( _ ii _ ) , we have @xmath381 whence @xmath382 where @xmath383 at @xmath384 , @xmath385 . in other words , @xmath386 is the above - calculated probability ( [ a57 ] ) of the c - photon @xmath5 c - roton transition in the case where there is a single c - photon in the initial state of the system , and there are no c - rotons . if @xmath387 , then the roton line in the spectrum of an shf signal is a line of absorption of photons ; but if @xmath388 the roton line is a line of their emission ( `` maser '' effect ) . in the experiment , the absorption line becomes weaker , as the power of a heat gun increases and transits to the emission line at @xmath389 .",
    "we assume that these facts are related to the forced creation of c - rotons by a gun .",
    "though all details of the mechanism are unclear up to now , we indicate several points .",
    "\\a ) a gun is directed along a tangent to the disk , i.e. , so that the transfer of an angular momentum should be maximum .",
    "the p - rotons have no angular momentum , but the c - rotons have ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , their creation is accompanied by the transfer of both the energy and the angular momentum .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that a step of @xmath373 corresponds to an increase in @xmath390 on the output of a gun by a value coinciding with the quantum @xmath391 of a circular velocity of helium near the resonator , according to the formula @xmath392 .",
    "the maximum experimental number of steps was @xmath393 .",
    "such a quantization of the velocity can mean that a gun creates a vortex in the superfluid component near the disk , whose axis coincides with the disk axis , and each step corresponds to the increase of the circulation by 1 .",
    "on the other hand , the action of the operator of azimuth momentum @xmath394 on the factor @xmath395 of the wf of a c - roton gives @xmath396 .",
    "dividing it by the @xmath0he atom mass , we obtain the azimuth velocity @xmath397 .",
    "thus , a c - roton induces the quantized rotation of helium atoms around the resonator with the velocity @xmath398 , like a vortex .",
    "but this rotation is accompanied by simultaneous oscillations . in turn ,",
    "an increase in the circular velocity of helium @xmath399 by an external factor must stimulate the creation of c - phonons ( including c - rotons ) .",
    "apparently , a gun creates a macroscopic vortex in helium ( or a superposition of vortices ) and many plane and circular phonons and rotons , so that the ensemble of quasiparticles near the disk is quite complicated .",
    "moreover , some processes ( e.g. , decays ) are allowed for c - phonons and forbidden for p - phonons .",
    "\\b ) the results of experiments with a gun testify unambiguously that an em wave creates namely c- , rather than p - rotons .",
    "if the latter would be created , then a decrease in the amplitude of the roton absorption line would be related , according to ( [ w - w ] ) , only to that a gun increases their number .",
    "but it increases also at a simple increase in the temperature ( without switching - on a gun ) ; however , the measurements show that this does not cause a weakening of the roton line and its transition into an emission line .",
    "\\c ) in a disk resonator , `` left '' ( l ) and `` right '' ( r ) c - photons differing by the sign of @xmath1 are created .",
    "a waveguide captures the total signal from the resonator , i.e. , the summary field of l- and r - waves . in this case , the amplitude of one of these waves in the resonator is @xmath400 times greater than another one @xcite .",
    "however , a gun creates c - rotons with only a single polarization , l- or r- , which depends on the position of a gun . since an l c - photon can induce only an l c - roton ( the same is true , respectively , for right ones ) , eq .",
    "( [ w - w ] ) should be written separately for l- and r - quanta",
    ". then we obtain that the summary absorption line disappears if the relation @xmath401 holds true for the dominant photon mode .",
    "a gun is able to weaken the line if the signs of @xmath1 for a c - roton and the dominant c - photon coincide and can not weaken if the signs do not coincide .",
    "thus , let a gun weaken the line at a given configuration of the em field .",
    "but if a gun is reoriented so that it twists he ii in the opposite direction , it must stop to weaken the line .",
    "it seems to us that this assertion can be easily verified in experiments .",
    "finally , we mention the observation of the linear stark effect in helium - ii  the roton absorption line splits into two lines in a constant electric field @xmath402 directed in the disk plane .",
    "the distance between them increases @xmath403 @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors advanced the idea of the relation of the effect to a possible quadrupole or instantaneous dipole , respectively , moment of a p - roton .",
    "we agree that a p - roton as a wave packet can possess an instantaneous dm @xmath352 with fluctuating ( or pulsing ) value and direction .",
    "this dm is due to , in particular , the interaction of the roton with neighboring quasiparticles located nonuniformly .",
    "such a dm induces an addition @xmath404 to the roton energy .",
    "since the projection of @xmath352 on @xmath402 takes the values in the continuous band @xmath405 $ ] , the mentioned addition transforms the roton level to the band .",
    "however , experiments demonstrate the splitting of the line into two ones , rather than a single band .",
    "thus , the instantaneous dm of a roton can not explain the observed line splitting .    according to quantum mechanics ,",
    "the effect can be explained if the roton energy level possesses at least a twofold degeneration which is taken off by the field @xmath402 . in our opinion ,",
    "the effect is determined by the existence of right ( @xmath406 ) and left ( @xmath407 ) c - rotons with the same energy , whose superposition is described by the wave function @xmath408 since a perturbing potential is obviously proportional to the applied field @xmath402 , we obtain the splitting of a twofold degenerate energy level which is proportional to @xmath409 it can be evaluated by the well - known formulas of perturbation theory for a degenerate state .",
    "the field @xmath402 induces the polarization of the dielectric resonator , which is directed along @xmath410 and takes off the degeneration , by breaking the circular symmetry .",
    "but the multiple degeneration by @xmath411 remains ( several tens of small @xmath411 significantly contribute to the line ) .",
    "so , if the field @xmath402 will be directed along the @xmath412 axis , then the line must be split into two lines due to the removal of the degeneration relative to a change in the sign of @xmath411 .    at the switching - on of a heat gun",
    ", we may expect the following . in the field",
    "@xmath410 the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian of he ii are not the @xmath170- and @xmath413-functions , @xmath414 and @xmath415 , but their superpositions @xmath416 characteristic of a twofold degenerate level @xcite .",
    "the gun oriented along a tangent to the disk creates the quantized rotation of helium in a _",
    "single _ direction and increases the number of c - rotons with one ( @xmath170 or @xmath413 ) polarization .",
    "it is obvious that , in this case , the gun can not excite the states @xmath416 ( @xmath417-superposition of two c - rotons with the counter rotation ) .",
    "therefore , if the field @xmath402 was already switched - on ( earlier than the gun ) , the gun will not decrease the peaks of the split roton line and will not induce the maser effect .",
    "it would be of interest to verify this prediction in experiments in similar fashion .",
    "it is seen from the above - presented analysis that the experiment @xcite has revealed the existence of particular excitations in he ii  circular rotons which are azimuth sound waves . in the present work ,",
    "we have approximately calculated the probability of the creation of a circular roton by the em field of the resonator and , on its basis , have evaluated the width of the absorption line at the roton frequency .",
    "the theoretical line is close to the experimental one by width but differs by shape .",
    "we have also advanced the assumption that the splitting of the line into two ones in a constant electric field is caused by the presence of right and left c - rotons and , respectively , by the twofold degeneration of the energy level of a circular roton .",
