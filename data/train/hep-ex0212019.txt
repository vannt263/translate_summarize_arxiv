    "hard scattering processes , such as inclusive deeply  inelastic scattering ( dis ) , semi  inclusive dis and hard exclusive scattering have an important property in common , namely the possibility to separate the exactly calculable perturbative parts of the reaction from the non  perturbative parts .",
    "this factorization property is well established in the case of inclusive and semi  inclusive dis and has been extensively used to investigate the structure of the nucleon . only a few years ago , factorization theorems have been established for some hard exclusive reactions , where the produced particle is e.g. a photon @xcite .",
    "their description in the theoretical framework of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite takes into account the dynamical correlations between partons of different momenta in the nucleon .",
    "the ordinary parton distribution functions and form factors turn out to be the limiting cases and moments of gpds , respectively . of particular interest",
    "is the second moment of two unpolarized quark gpds , which for the first time offers a possibility to determine the total angular momentum carried by the quarks in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical ideas indicate that gdps are able to describe correlations between the longitudinal and transverse structure of the nucleon @xcite . for the case of coherent hard exclusive processes on nuclei it was pointed out very recently @xcite that information about the distribution of energy , pressure , and shear forces inside nucleons and nuclei become accessible .",
    "in deeply  virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) a photon with large virtuality @xmath2 is absorbed by a parton inside the nucleon and a real photon is produced .",
    "this process is considered to be the theoretically cleanest way to access gpds .",
    "the dvcs cross section can be obtained through a measurement of the exclusive photon production cross section after subtracting the background from the bethe ",
    "heitler ( bh ) process which has an identical final state and is calculable exactly in qed .",
    "first results on the dvcs cross section at high energies have been published recently by h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite . at the lower energies of hermes at desy and clas at jlab",
    ", the dvcs cross section is expected to be much smaller than the bh cross section and thus a measurement with sufficient precision is not yet feasible",
    ". however , the dvcs amplitudes are directly accessible through the interference between the dvcs and bh processes .",
    "the leading  order and leading  twist interference term @xcite @xmath3\\ ] ] depends on the charge and the polarization of the incident lepton , where + ( - ) in front of the expression corresponds to a negatively ( positively ) charged lepton with polarization @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 represents the proton mass , @xmath6 the square of the four  momentum transfer to the target , @xmath7 the virtual  photon four  momentum squared , @xmath8 the momentum fraction of the nucleon carried by the struck quark , and @xmath9 is the polarization parameter of the virtual photon .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath10 is defined as the angle between the lepton scattering plane , i.e. the plane defined by the incoming and the outgoing lepton trajectories , and the photon production plane made up by the virtual and real photons . the linear combination of dvcs amplitudes @xmath11 can be expressed as a linear combination of gpds convoluted with hard scattering amplitudes .",
    "appropriate cross section asymmetries allow the separate access to the real and imaginary part of @xmath11 .",
    "the beam  spin asymmetry ( bsa ) @xmath12 is proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath11 , where the average polarization of the beam is given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) represents the normalized yield for positive ( negative ) beam helicity .",
    "the subscripts @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote a longitudinally polarized beam and an unpolarized target .",
    "measurements of the bsa on the proton have already been carried out by hermes @xcite and clas @xcite .",
    "the new preliminary result on the proton based on hermes data collected in 2000 is shown in the left panel of figure [ yield ] .",
    "the asymmetry indeed shows the expected @xmath18 modulation .",
    "note that although the average kinematic values are slightly different compared to those from the already published bsa from the 1996/97 running period @xcite , the results are consistent with each other .",
    "recently , the first measurement of the beam  charge asymmetry , accessing the real part of the same combination of dvcs amplitudes , has been carried out at hermes @xcite via the scattering of positron and electron beams off an unpolarized hydrogen target .",
    "the data presented in the following have been accumulated by the hermes experiment @xcite at desy during the 2000 running period . the hera 27.6 gev positron beam was scattered off polarized and unpolarized deuterium and unpolarized neon gas targets .",
    "both the unpolarized and the spin  averaged polarized target data have been used in this analysis .",
    "selected events contained exactly one photon and one charged track identified as the scattered positron .",
    "the kinematical requirements were @xmath19  gev@xmath20 , @xmath21  gev@xmath20 and @xmath22  gev . here",
    "@xmath23 denotes the photon ",
    "nucleon invariant mass and @xmath24 is the virtual  photon energy .",
    "the angle between the real and the virtual photon was required to be within 2 and 70  mrad .     for the hard exclusive electroproduction of photons off the proton .",
    "exclusive events are defined through the missing mass constraint @xmath25  gev .",
    "right panel : @xmath26 distribution of single - photon yields for neon , deuterium and hydrogen normalized to the number of dis events .",
    "the exclusive events ( @xmath25  gev ) are shown separately.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]   for the hard exclusive electroproduction of photons off the proton .",
    "exclusive events are defined through the missing mass constraint @xmath25  gev .",
    "right panel : @xmath26 distribution of single - photon yields for neon , deuterium and hydrogen normalized to the number of dis events .",
    "the exclusive events ( @xmath25  gev ) are shown separately.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]    in the right panel of figure [ yield ] the normalized yield of single photon events is shown versus @xmath26 for neon and deuterium in comparison to hydrogen .",
    "note that negative values of @xmath26 appear due to the finite resolution of the spectrometer .",
    "since the recoiling nucleus is not detected in the hermes spectrometer , the missing mass @xmath27 is calculated from @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the four  momenta of virtual photon , target nucleus and real photon , respectively . for this analysis the target mass is set to the proton mass in order to keep the same @xmath25  gev definition for exclusive events regardless of the target .",
    "the cross section for the exclusive events is dominated by the bh contribution , i.e. when going from nucleon to nuclei it increases with the square of the charge diminished by the form factor squared .",
    "this explains the differences in the single ",
    "photon yield for the different targets at small values of @xmath26 , i.e. for exclusive events as shown in the right panel of figure  [ yield ] .    in figure [ bsas ]",
    "the azimuthal dependences of the bsas on deuterium and neon are shown for events with a missing mass @xmath31 below 1.7  gev . at the given average kinematics",
    "as indicated in the plots , the data exhibit the expected @xmath18 behavior represented by the fit to the function @xmath32 .",
    "note that @xmath8 is calculated using the proton mass , i.e. @xmath33 . as an independent method the @xmath18weighted moments @xmath34 are shown in figure [ sins ] versus the missing mass @xmath31 .",
    "the moments are non  zero only in the exclusive region and integrating @xmath35 up to @xmath25  gev yield the same results as the fits for the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "note , that negative values of the missing mass are again a consequence of the finite momentum resolution of the spectrometer , in that case @xmath37 was defined .",

    "the bsa on the deuteron is expected to be slightly smaller @xcite than the one on the proton .",
    "this is in agreement with our results when comparing the left panels in figure [ yield ] and figure [ bsas ] , where the bsas on the proton and the deuteron , achieved in a similar average kinematic region , amount to @xmath38  ( stat ) @xmath39  ( sys ) and @xmath40  ( stat ) @xmath39  ( sys ) , respectively .",
    "however , present theoretical predictions assume @xmath41  gev@xmath20 in order to avoid possible large target  mass corrections which have not yet been calculated for spin1 targets .",
    "in addition , since at hermes the recoiling nucleus is presently not detected , the ratio of coherent to incoherent production can not be directly inferred from the measurement . for nuclei heavier than the deuteron no predictions are available yet .",
    "weighted moments @xmath35 for the hard electroproduction of photons off deuterium ( left panel ) and neon ( right panel ) versus the missing mass @xmath31.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ] weighted moments @xmath35 for the hard electroproduction of photons off deuterium ( left panel ) and neon ( right panel ) versus the missing mass @xmath31.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]    in summary , beam  spin asymmetries in the hard electroproduction of real photons off nuclei have been measured for the first time .",
    "sizeable asymmetries of @xmath40  ( stat )  @xmath39  ( sys ) and @xmath42  ( stat )  @xmath39  ( sys ) have been found in the exclusive region for deuterium and neon , respectively .",
    "the corresponding asymmetry on the proton amounts to @xmath38  ( stat )  @xmath39  ( sys ) .",
    "this value is in agreement with the already published data from an earlier running period",
