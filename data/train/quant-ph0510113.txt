    "light is an optimal candidate to be a carrier of quantum information because photonic states are durable due to the generally weak interaction with the environment . for this reason ,",
    "the only realistic proposals for long distance quantum communication are still based on optical systems @xcite .",
    "photonic states are conveniently manipulated by means of linear optics and photodetection .",
    "however , most schemes to process photonic quantum information by means of linear optics require the ability to produce single photons .",
    "for example , the ingenious linear optics quantum computation scheme proposed by knill , laflamme and milburn in  @xcite as well as the schemes for secure quantum communication in @xcite rely on the availability of single photons .",
    "single photons entangled with the vacuum ( @xmath2 ) by a symmetric beam splitter can also be employed to teleport and transform single - rail optical qubits @xcite . moreover , single - photon sources are a necessary resource in photonic quantum state engineering  @xcite .    in recent years a variety of implementations for single photon sources has been investigated . among them are schemes based on single molecule or atom excitation @xcite , single ions trapped in cavities @xcite , color centers in diamonds @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and parametric down conversion ( pdc ) @xcite .",
    "these sources differ in the wavelength and purity of the emitted photons , their repetition rate and whether they produce a photon on demand or heralded , i.e , announced by an event .",
    "the latter is for example the case with pdc - sources .",
    "pdc produces randomly photon pairs and the presence of one photon is indicated by the detection of the other .",
    "none of the existing single - photon sources , however , emits a pure single photon at a given time with certainty .",
    "the emission of multiple photons is negligible for most single - photon sources , cf .",
    "for example  @xcite . therefore their output in a certain mode can be modeled by a mixture of a single photon fock state @xmath0 and vacuum @xmath1 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is called the _ efficiency _ of the single - photon source .",
    "good sources have efficiencies of @xmath5 . to the best of our knowledge the highest efficiencies reached so far are @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite .    in this article",
    "we propose a scheme to process two outputs from imperfect single photon sources ( with efficiency @xmath8 ) in order to obtain a single photon with certainty ( @xmath9 ) as desired for quantum information applications .",
    "these outputs may in fact originate from the same source . using only linear optics and photodetection , it is impossible to produce a pure single photon with certainty by processing the outputs of imperfect sources .",
    "this is the case even if instead of two a finite number @xmath10 of imperfect sources are employed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in order to obtain by means of linear optics a single photon with a probability @xmath8 , which surpasses the efficiencies of the input sources , at least four such sources are needed .",
    "a corresponding scheme has been devised in @xcite at the expense of adding an additional multi - photon component to the output .",
    "combining linear optics with homodyne detection seems not to improve the efficiency @xmath4 .",
    "this has been shown at least for the case where only a single copy of the state @xmath11 as given in eq .",

    "these results suggest the usage of non - linear optical elements to improve the efficiency of imperfect single photon sources .    a possible solution to clean the single photon part in @xmath11 from the vacuum contribution ( to build a `` photon washer '' ) might be the usage of a quantum non - demolition measurement as proposed in @xcite . in this article",

    "[ scheme ] ) to generate pure single photons and shows how the improvement of the efficiency is accomplished ( sec .",
    "[ calculation ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ realisations ] we sketch settings where two - photon absorption might occur with sufficiently high probability to make the scheme feasible . in the appendix",

    "one of the resulting outputs is ignored ( mode @xmath14 ) whereas the second one ( mode @xmath15 ) is used as input of a mach - zehnder interferometer , which has a two - photon - absorbing medium ( @xmath16 ) in one of its arms .",
    "a successful generation of a single - photon fock state @xmath0 is indicated by a click of detector d@xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . ]    in this section we describe the setup and sketch the underlying physical ideas heuristically .",
    "the related calculations are then presented in the next section .",
    "our setup is depicted in fig .",
    "[ twophoton ] .",
    "the inputs @xmath19 and @xmath12 originate from two identical _ imperfect _ single - mode single - photon sources , with equal efficiency @xmath4 : @xmath20 , cf .",
    "( [ imperfect ] ) .",
    "the first step of our scheme consists in superposing the two input states @xmath19 and @xmath12 at a beam splitter bs@xmath21 .",
    "one of the resulting outputs is discarded , whereas the other one is processed .",
    "the latter is used as input of a mach - zehnder interferometer with a _ two - photon absorbing medium _ ( @xmath16 ) in one of its arms . the interferometer is then followed by a photodetector d@xmath17 which is required to click _ only _ in the case of a single photon .",
    "the detector measures one of the interferometer s outputs , its second output contains the desired single - photon state @xmath0 whenever a click in d@xmath17 occurs .",
    "the essential element of our arrangement is the two - photon - absorbing medium in one of the arms of the interferometer .",
    "its action on the electromagnetic field in mode b is assumed to be given by @xmath22 in transformation  ( [ tpam ] ) the first factor of the state represents the fock state of mode b. the second factor refers to the _ collective _ quantum state of the medium .",

    "thus , only if two photons propagate through the @xmath16 there is a non - vanishing probability @xmath25 that _ both _ photons are absorbed . in case of one or zero photons in mode",
    "b no photon absorption takes place ..    for @xmath26 the @xmath16 acts unitarily . to be more general we may also allow the @xmath16 to induce a non - unitary transformation , describing , e.g. , a unitary process followed by measurements . in the latter case @xmath27 . later in this paper",
    "we will provide two possible realizations of the @xmath16 .",
    "one of them realizes a unitary @xmath16 ( see sec .",

    "are present .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we will refer to a medium causing transformation  ( [ tpam ] ) as a two - photon absorbing medium ( @xmath16 ) regardless whether the latter or the former effect prevails .",
    "beam splitters bs@xmath17 and bs@xmath34 are chosen such that in the absence of the @xmath16 detector d@xmath17 can not click , as a result of destructive interference within the interferometer . in this case",
    "the photons can leave the setup only in mode @xmath35 .",
    "the mere existence of the interaction  ( [ tpam ] ) leading to entanglement between the photons and the @xmath16 destroys , partially , the interference of the two paths of the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "for two incoming photons the interference is disturbed maximally in case @xmath36 . in this latter case",
    "the @xmath16 functions as a measuring apparatus performing a _ null - measurement_. null - measurements are also called , in a slightly misleading way , interaction - free measurements   @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "an event becomes possible which would be impossible in the absence of the @xmath16 , namely , the detection of a single photon at the detector d@xmath17 .",
    "such a detection is possible only if two photons propagate through the interferometer .",
    "thus , when detecting a single photon in d@xmath17 we know on the one hand that two photons have been fed into the setup and on the other hand that they have not been absorbed by the @xmath16 . as a consequence , if conditioning on detection of a single photon in detector d@xmath17 , we can be sure that there is another single photon leaving the setup in mode @xmath35 .",

    "here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the creation operators corresponding to the field modes @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and @xmath44 is some functional of them . in the same way we can represent the output state by @xmath45 , where the creation operators @xmath46 , @xmath47 refer to the new field modes @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath48 is some new functional . in order to obtain the output state @xmath49 from a given input state @xmath50 we have simply to perform the following formal replacements in @xmath51 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath52 i.e. , @xmath53 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "however , in what follows below , we will denote the output field modes by the same letters omitting the prime labels , with a convention as already depicted in fig.[twophoton ] .",
    "note that the replacement transformation ( [ generalbeamsplittertrafo ] ) should not be confused with the transformation of operators in the heisenberg picture .",
    "the initial input state reads : @xmath54 where the first and the second slot represent the number of photons in mode @xmath14 and mode @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we will see below that only the two - photon term of eq .",
    "( [ initialinputstate ] ) is decisive , and that both photons have to be directed into mode @xmath15 by beam splitter bs@xmath21 .",
    "starting with a general transformation ( [ generalbeamsplittertrafo ] ) for bs@xmath21 we calculate the density matrix which results for mode @xmath15 after applying bs@xmath21 to the initial input state @xmath55 and tracing out the discarded mode @xmath14 : @xmath56 thus , the two - photon part is least diminished for @xmath57 .",
    "it is therefore favorable to use a 50/50-splitter bs@xmath21 . in this case",
    "the density matrix in mode @xmath15 becomes @xmath58 in order to make the calculation transparent we assume that also bs@xmath17 and bs@xmath34 are 50/50- beam splitters with @xmath59 , cf .  fig .",
    "[ twophoton ] .",
    "the action of the beam splitters bs@xmath17 and bs@xmath34 on modes @xmath15 and @xmath35 is then given by : @xmath60 later in this section we will report that by employing more suitable beam splitters bs@xmath17 and bs@xmath34 the success probability for a heralded single - photon generation can be enhanced .",
    "there are three possible _ pure _ input states that can enter the mach - zehnder interferometer in mode @xmath15 .",

    "we discuss the three alternative cases separately .",
    "the case of zero photons which occurs with probability @xmath61 trivially can not be related with a click at the second single - photon detector d@xmath17 .",
    "let us now consider the case that exactly one photon is fed into the setup .",
    "it can come either from the input @xmath19 in mode a or from input @xmath12 in mode b. the over - all probability for a single photon being in mode @xmath15 amounts to @xmath62 .",
    "the photon interferes with the vacuum ( in mode @xmath35 ) at the beam - splitter @xmath63 . in",
    "the following the first slot of the kets refers to mode @xmath15 and the second slot to mode @xmath35 .",

    "( [ tpam ] ) and ( [ beamsplittertrafo ] ) : @xmath65 in the last line @xmath66 represents a projective selective measurement on mode @xmath15 , the result being a detection of a single photon .",
    "thus , just one photon entering the setup in mode @xmath14 or @xmath15 can not cause a click in detector d@xmath17 .",
    "what happens in the case in which two photons are fed into the setup , one in mode a and one in mode b ? in the calculation below we will need to take into account also the state of the medium as soon as the measurement - like interaction inside the tpam is applied .",
    "furthermore , we will discard the mode which is detected .",
    "again , the first slot of the kets refers to mode @xmath15 and the second slot to mode @xmath35 , whereas the third slot represents the state of the medium .",

    "the @xmath16 is transferred in a non - local way to the ground state @xmath23 .",
    "the above calculation shows that , whenever two photons are fed into the setup there is a non - vanishing probability for a click event at the final detector d@xmath17 .",
    "moreover , on the condition of this event one can be sure that another single photon is leaving our device in mode @xmath35 .",

    "with the probability for two photons entering the mach - zehnder interferometer in mode @xmath15 being @xmath70 ( cf .",
    "eq.([rho_b_symmetricbs_0 ] ) ) , the over - all _ probability for success _ thus amounts to @xmath71      the success probability @xmath72 can be increased by employing more suitable beam splitters bs@xmath17 and bs@xmath34 .",
    "this follows from an analysis of the scheme using general beam - splitter transformations  ( [ generalbeamsplittertrafo ] ) for bs@xmath17 and bs@xmath34 .",
    "we omit the details of the calculations .",
    "the requirement that a single photon entering the setup either in mode @xmath14 or in mode @xmath15 must not cause a click in the detector d@xmath17 restricts the possible values of the beam - splitter parameters @xmath73 .",
    "this requirement firstly implies that @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "the conditions for @xmath76 and @xmath77 depend on whether @xmath78 or @xmath79 , with @xmath75 . in the first case we must have @xmath80 , while in the second case we must choose @xmath76 and @xmath77 such that @xmath81 .",
    "taking into account these conditions we obtain the following : if we choose @xmath78 and @xmath82 or @xmath79 and @xmath83 , the calculation yields @xmath84 whereas the choices @xmath78 and @xmath85 or @xmath79 and @xmath86 lead to @xmath87 please note , that the optimal reflectivity of bs@xmath17 and bs@xmath34 does not depend on the parameters characterizing the @xmath16 .",
    "the success probability becomes maximal for @xmath88 in the first case  ( [ successfirstcase ] ) and for @xmath89 in the second case  ( [ successsecondcase ] ) .",
    "the most suitable beam splitters thus turn out to be a @xmath90 with reflectivity of @xmath91 and a bs@xmath34 with reflectivity of @xmath92 , or vice versa .",
    "in addition the phase condition @xmath93 has to be fulfilled .",
    "the maximal success probability that can be reached by variation of the beam - splitter parameters , is @xmath94 it still depends on @xmath95 , which characterizes the action of the @xmath16 , cf .",

    "@xmath96 becomes zero , if there is no @xmath16 in one of the interferometer arms , i.e. ,  in case @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath96 becomes maximal for @xmath98 , which means no two - photon absorption but just a non - linear phase shift . in the latter case",
    "a success probability @xmath99 is attained .",
    "note , that to alter the phase of @xmath95 by introducing a global phase factor in the third transformation rule of ( [ tpam ] ) would entail the introduction of the same phase factor in the first two transformation rules of ( [ tpam ] ) .",
    "the calculations show that probability @xmath96 is left invariant , as it is expected , under such a global phase change . in the next section",
    "we consider realizations of @xmath16s with real positive values for @xmath95 . in this case",
    "@xmath96 increases with growing two - photon absorption rate .",
    "it assumes its maximal value @xmath100 for @xmath36 or @xmath101 , respectively .     using identical interferometers with a @xmath16 and final detectors d@xmath17",
    " instead of discarding one of them as done in the original setup ( cf .   fig .",
    "[ twophoton ] ) . ]    a further enhancement of the success probability _ by a factor of _ 2 can be achieved by processing the second output of bs@xmath21 in the same way as the first one ( cf .",
    "[ doubletpam ] ) , instead of discarding it .",
    "the second output is directed into an identical interferometer with a @xmath16 and a final detector d@xmath17 .",
    "provided that two ingoing photons take the upper way this alternative heralds a pure single photon with the same probability as in the lower case . since both photons choose either the upper or the lower path with equal probability  due to the hong - ou - mandel effect",
    " the two alternatives are exclusive .",
    "therefore the corresponding success probabilities for heralding a photon are additive . as a result ,",
    "the over - all maximum success probability that can in principle be achieved with such an extension of our scheme amounts to @xmath102 .",
    "this is remarkably high as compared to the upper bound @xmath103 of the probability for a heralded generation of a single photon from two identical sources with efficiency @xmath4 .",
    "we believe that the scheme proposed above is interesting in its own right . whether our method to generate a single photon from two imperfect sources can already be applied in a laboratory",
    "depends on the availability of a setup which realizes state transformation ( [ tpam ] ) , such that the success probability @xmath104 is sufficiently high . in the following we are going to suggest two candidates for the implementation of state transformation ( [ tpam ] )",
    ". we will refer to each of them as two - photon absorbing medium ( tpam ) , even though they rather resemble machines built out of several units .",
    "both tpams use special settings to amplify two - photon absorption , which normally is a much weaker effect than absorption or scattering of a single photon .",
    "these settings stem from different contexts .",
    "we propose modifications which make them suitable for our purpose .",
    "a tpam is realized whenever the medium can absorb two photons , whereas just one photon is not absorbed . a good model for understanding two - photon absorption",
    "is given by three - level atoms ( cf .",
    "[ tpa2 ] illustrates how two - photon absorption can take place , while single - photon absorption is impossible due to detuning .    .",
    "in ( a ) a single photon can be absorbed .",
    "this is avoided by detuning ( b ) . ]",
    "two - photon absorption is a nonlinear effect and is therefore commonly expected to be small for intensities corresponding to a few photons only . a way to amplify",
    "this nonlinear process is to insert three - level atoms with appropriate detuning into a thin hollow optical fiber .",
    "such a proposal has recently been discussed by franson  et  al .  in  @xcite in the context of optical realizations of quantum gates .",
    "there it is argued that the confinement of a single - photon wave packet within a very narrow optical fiber involves concentration of the photon energy into a very small volume .",
    "the confinement can thus produce relatively large electric fields which in turn entail the possibility of large nonlinearities , including two - photon absorption . according to estimates provided in  @xcite it is feasible to achieve two - photon absorption rates in optical fibers that correspond to a two - photon absorption length on the order of @xmath105 .",
    "given that such values can in fact be achieved , we believe that @xmath106-values ( cf .  eqs .  [ tpam ] ) close to @xmath107 are feasible .",
    "since in this realization of the @xmath16 no measurements take place , the transformation  ( [ tpam ] ) is unitary and therefore we have @xmath108 for high two - photon absorption rates , which involves a success probability @xmath109 .",
    "certain losses need to be overcome that might cause failure events of such a realization of the single - photon generator .",
    "the main technical challenge seems to consist in suppressing the single - photon scattering which , under most conditions , is expected to prevail the two - photon absorption . however , scattering of a single photon into another mode is suppressed due to the fact that only the propagation of a certain mode is supported within a _ single - mode _ optical fiber . the mere fact that quantum key distribution is possible , which relies on the feasibility to transmit single photons through several kilometers of optical fibers , is a strong evidence that losses due to single - photon scattering can be made negligible .",
    "additional losses might be caused when coupling the photons into the optical fiber .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by using imperfect single photon sources that provide photons _ inside _ a single - mode optical fiber _ at the outset_. such imperfect single photon sources have been reported on , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is experimentally feasible to realize beam splitters and phase shifters by means of optical fibers ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . thus , our setup of sec .",
    "[ scheme ] can be built in such a way that all processes apart from the final detection take place within optical fibers .",
    "we believe that all these problems can be tackled so as to make our proposal of sec .",
    "[ scheme ] and [ calculation ] promising .      in this section",
    "we introduce another method to realize a two - photon absorbing medium ( tpam ) , which we refer to as `` time selection '' .",
    "we first outline the principle .",
    "then we describe a setup with non - linear optics proposed by johnsson and fleischhauer  @xcite and modify it to realize a tpam based on time selection .",
    "the @xmath16 in our scheme has the task to only absorb a pair of photons while being transparent for a single photon .",
    "the obvious way to tackle this task is by means of energy selection . that is to choose a medium whose transition energy is on resonance with the energy of two photons but not with the energy of a single photon .",
    "the required two photon process is a second order effect and has to be enhanced by a special setting to occur with a reasonable probability .",
    "the setup described in the previous section goes along these lines by confining the electromagnetic field in an optical fiber .",
    "we now turn to a different scheme .",
    "an alternative to energy selection might be `` time selection '' , which will be explained in the following .",
    "let us assume that the state of light in the medium traverses a cycle with a period which depends on the initial number of photons .",

    "a special instance of the desired transformation ( [ tpam ] ) is established and the tpam comprising the vapor of five - level atoms , the driving field @xmath125 and a detector @xmath159 can be implemented in one arm of the mach - zehnder interferometer ( cf .",

    "@xmath172 length yields a sufficiently high probability for two photon absorption .",
    "the second candidate employs resonant four - wave mixing in a vapor of five - level atoms with a strong coherent cw driving field @xmath125 in addition to the incident light field @xmath118 from the imperfect sources . due to the four - wave mixing two additional light fields @xmath120 and @xmath121 are generated and the energy cycles between the four fields .",
    "the period depends on the number of photons @xmath118 initially contains .",
    "the length of the medium is adjusted such that a single photon in @xmath118 leaves the atomic vapor unchanged while two photons are entangled with the generated fields @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "this work was supported by the center for applied photonics  ( cap ) at the university of konstanz .",
    "we found two alternative modifications of the setup of fleischhauer and johnsson ( see sec.[jf ] ) to generate a pure single - photon state out of two noisy photon states @xmath20 .",

    "the input field @xmath118 of the tpam consists of the mixture ( [ rho_b_symmetricbs_0 ] ) gained from superposing state @xmath19 and @xmath12 at a symmetric beam splitter bs@xmath21 .",
