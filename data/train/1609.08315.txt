    "the introduction of the adjoint neutron transport was one of the key landmarks in the evolution of nuclear reactor physics .",
    "the solution of this equation was interpreted as neutron importance and opened the way to many applications in nuclear reactor physics and engineering .",
    "the basic concept of neutron importance was established by weinberg and wigner @xcite , although the idea was proposed in various forms also by other authors .",
    "a consistent derivation of the adjoint boltzmann equation for the critical reactor in steady state and its physical interpretation as the neutron importance conservation equation in integro - differential form is due to ussachoff @xcite .",
    "the integral form of the adjoint transport equation has also been introduced @xcite and in a recent contribution the connection between adjoints and green s functions is highlighted @xcite .",
    "the concept was also generalized to source - driven systems and to time - dependent situations .",
    "a general approach to the theory of neutron importance was proposed and discussed by lewins @xcite , as `` the physical basis of variational and perturbation theory in transport and diffusion problems '' . as this subtitle of lewins",
    "s book clearly states , the theory of the adjoint function lays the foundation for the applications of perturbation and variational methods in the field of nuclear reactor physics . over the years , these methods have provided powerful and effective tools for the analysis of nuclear reactors .",
    "the literature on the interpretation and on the applications of the adjoint function is huge ( it is impossible to give an exhaustive list of references here ; see the bibliography in lewins s book that covers at least the earliest history @xcite ) .",
    "a significant thrust forward in perturbation analysis is due to gandini @xcite .",
    "his generalizations led to a huge extension of the possibilities of the perturbative approach in various fields of applied sciences .",
    "as an example , in nuclear reactor physics , the technique could be effectively used in the fields of nuclide evolution and fuel cycle @xcite and it can be applied also to non - linear problems .",
    "a theory of the adjoint function can be developed also for source - driven problems , once a problem - tailored definition of the adjoint function is introduced @xcite .",
    "the methods developed for nuclear reactor kinetics rely heavily on the neutron importance concept .",
    "the standard kinetic equations for the point reactor were consistently derived by projection of the neutron balance equations on the adjoint function @xcite . the various quasi - static schemes for spatial and spectral kinetics nowadays used for time - dependent full - core simulations",
    "are based on this idea ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . at last",
    "it is worth to cite the use of the adjoint quantities in modern sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification , which have a crucial role in today s nuclear science @xcite .",
    "some efforts were made in the past to sample weighted quantities directly in the monte carlo ( mc ) process .",
    "the significant work by rief on direct perturbation evaluations by monte carlo should be acknowledged @xcite .",
    "also some more recent work must be acknowledged @xcite .",
    "the sampling of weighted quantities has been introduced for the evaluation of integral reactor parameters @xcite .    the capability to evaluate the adjoint function is included in the standard deterministic neutronic codes used for reactor analysis .",
    "monte carlo statistical methods are gaining a prominent role in a wide set of nuclear applications and the information on neutron importance is being used to guide the sampling procedure and speed up its convergence .",
    "the importance sampling techniques can be included within the frame of the so - called contributon theory @xcite .",
    "several works have been performed with the objective of accelerating the statistical convergence of monte carlo ( see , for instance , @xcite and the bibliography therein ) .",
    "however , the possibility of using monte carlo for the solution of the adjoint equation is very attractive per se .",
    "two approaches are possible : either a backward neutron propagation technique @xcite or a proper forward procedure @xcite .",
    "many authors have tackled the problem , with various attempts to maintain the same sampling approach as the one used in the direct monte carlo simulation , although no physical interpretation of such procedures is usually given @xcite .",
    "the procedure leads to the introduction of a concept of pseudo - particles , named adjunctons , which , through an appropriate transport process , are distributed as the adjoint function . in this framework ,",
    "starting from the integral form of the transport equation , the work by irving is certainly standing @xcite .    in the present work a consistent approach to the sampling procedure for a monte carlo simulation for the adjoint function",
    "is illustrated and a physical interpretation is discussed .",
    "the procedure draws its inspiration from the work carried out by de matteis @xcite .",
    "further developments were presented in a later work @xcite .",
    "the concept of pseudo - particles named adjunctons and of adjoint cross sections was used in these works , as well as in the works by eriksson @xcite and by irving @xcite    in the following the sampling procedure for the solution of the adjoint equation is defined for a fixed source problem , although it could be easily extended to eigenvalue simulations .",
    "the interest is mainly focused on the energy and direction variables , since the problem in space can be handled by simple extension of the procedure for the direct equation .",
    "afterwards , the validation of the sampling procedure is considered .",
    "a reliable benchmark can be employed for this purpose : analytical benchmarks are particularly useful for a sound validation , since they are not affected by any discretization or truncation error and they have been widely proposed for various physical problems in transport theory @xcite . to obtain an analytical benchmark the classical problem of neutron slowing down in an infinite medium",
    "is considered .",
    "the direct problem leads to the classical placzek functions @xcite . on the other hand , in this work",
    ", the adjoint equation is solved analytically using the same approach as for the direct equation , showing an interesting and useful duality property , and the results are compared to the ones obtained by monte carlo . as a last outcome of the work here presented ,",
    "a fully analytical closed - form for both the direct and adjoint placzek functions is obtained .",
    "the neutron transport equation reads @xcite : @xmath0 where , when necessary , also the fission process is introduced in the source term as : @xmath1    the static version of the transport equation is now considered . in the presence of fission and of an external source a physically meaningful solution exists , i.e. non - negative over the whole phase space considered , only if the fundamental multiplication eigenvalue @xmath2 , defined by : @xmath3 is strictly smaller than unity ( @xmath4 ) .    for the purpose of the present work the ( possible ) space dependence is not relevant and , therefore , the static version of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xxxxyyy ] ) for an infinite homogeneous system with homogeneous isotropic source is considered : @xmath5 clearly , the angular flux must be space independent . furthermore",
    ", if an isotropic medium is considered , the transfer kernel depends only on @xmath6 and , hence , the angular flux is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "this is physically easily understandable , since the flux must be isotropic in an isotropic homogeneous infinite medium , since no source of anisotropy is present .",
    "it can be also proved mathematically , observing that , in such a case , the collision integral in the r.h.s . of",
    "the above equation , by integration over all @xmath8 , obviously turns out to be @xmath7 independent .",
    "the equation takes the following form : @xmath9 one can now define partial collision kernels through the following expression : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents - in analogy with the usual fission term - the _ mean number of neutrons emitted by a collision of type @xmath2 which has been triggered by a neutron of energy @xmath12 _ ) it is possible to include also collision processes other than fission or scattering . ] .",
    "the _ total collision kernel _",
    "@xmath13 is then expressed as a probability - weighted sum of partial collision kernels : @xmath14 in these last two relations it is implicit that the energy - angle distributions @xmath15 are normalized _ with respect to the outgoing neutron energy @xmath12 _ , so that a probabilistic intepretation , useful for sampling in a monte carlo procedure , is natural : whenever a neutron with ( incoming ) energy @xmath16 suffers a collision , which is of the kind @xmath17 with probability @xmath18 , then a mean number @xmath19 of neutrons exits from collision with energy and angular distribution given by @xmath20 .",
    "these relations are the conceptual basis for the monte carlo sampling process in neutron transport .",
    "as anticipated , the space dependence is omitted in the present discussion .    by straighforward mathematical reasoning",
    ", the equation adjoint to ( [ eqn : directeq ] ) takes the following form : @xmath21 a few comments on the physical meaning of this equation are worth - while .",
    "although one refers to @xmath22 as the `` adjoint flux '' , physically it is not a flux .",
    "it is known as `` neutron importance '' , it is not a density and as such it is a dimensionless quantity , quite differently from the neutron flux .",
    "this fact leads also to an interpretation of the integral terms in the above equation ( [ eqn : adj ] ) that is quite different from the interpretation of the corresponding terms in equation ( [ eqn : directeq ] ) .",
    "for instance , to physically derive the scattering integral term in the balance established by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : directeq ] ) , one takes the total track length within the elementary volume @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 , and multiplies by the transfer function @xmath25 , in order to obtain the number of neutrons emitted per unit energy and per unit solid angle at @xmath12 and @xmath7 .",
    "the integration collects the contributions from all possible incoming energies and directions . on the other hand , for the balance of importance in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : adj ] ) , one must collect the contributions to importance of all neutrons generated by the scattering of a neutron characterized by energy @xmath12 and direction @xmath7 .",
    "therefore @xmath26 is the fraction of scattered neutrons within @xmath23 and , consequently , their contributions to the balance of importance is obtained multiplying by the importance of neutrons at the outgoing energy @xmath16 and direction @xmath8 .",
    "the integration now collects the contributions from all possible outgoing energies and directions .",
    "the simplest way to obtain a basis for the mc simulation of the adjoint flux is to manipulate eq .",
    "( [ eqn : adj ] ) in such a way as to obtain a set of relations formally identical to ( [ eqn : forwone ] , [ eqn : forwtwo ] ) ; we remark that the main difficulty in developing a sampling scheme for ( [ eqn : adj ] ) stems from the fact that in this case @xmath16 is the energy of particles outgoing from the collision .",
    "it is clear that this difficulty can be ( formally ) overcome by defining @xmath27 in such a way that ( [ eqn : adjf ] ) appears identical to ( [ eqn : forwone ] ) , _ provided one assumes - or better defines _",
    "- @xmath28 , which implies that the total rate of collision for the pseudo - particles here implicitly introduced into the game is the same as for the corresponding physical particles : this is the only physical constraint we assume to set up a simulation framework for the adjoint equation . in this way we obtain for the adjoint equation",
    ": @xmath29 we underline that the superscript @xmath30 does not imply here transposition and complex conjugation , but it simply hints to the fact that dagged quantities refer to the parameters defining the transport properties of pseudo - particles : through this identification a purely formal transposition acquires a true physical meaning .",
    "however this is not sufficient , because we must also require that the adjoint kernel takes the form of a sum of partial collision kernels for pseudo - particles , namely : @xmath31 so that we can interpret all the dagged quantities in the same fashion as the original macroscopic cross sections for neutrons , in particular the fact that the probability for the @xmath2-reaction to happen is given by @xmath32 .",
    "then one can write : @xmath33 by equating ( [ 111 ] ) and ( [ 222 ] ) , the following relation is established : @xmath34 which is trivially fulfilled if for all reactions : @xmath35 this seemingly obvious solution requires however a non trivial assumption , that pseudo - particles are subject to the same set of reactions as neutrons .",
    "this is not at all mandatory and it is simply a convenient choice for the purpose of simulation . along this line of thought",
    "we can assume that not only the total cross section for pseudo - particles is the same as for neutrons , but that the same happens for all partial reactions , that is for all @xmath2 : @xmath36 however analogies between forward and adjoint simulation shall not go beyond this point , essentially because the true difference between the two cases is that in taking the adjoint we loose the kernel normalization ( with respect to outgoing energies and directions ) .",
    "in fact , if we assume - as it is natural - that the partial adjoint kernels are normalized with respect to the outgoing pseudo - particle energy @xmath37 by integrating ( [ eqn : soladj ] ) over @xmath12 and @xmath7 , we have : @xmath38 which implies that , in general , the mean number of pseudo - particles outgoing from a collision is not the same as for neutrons .",
    "it is remarkable that with these choices neutron importance can again be interpreted as a flux ( density ) of pseudo - particles , so that for instance traditional collision or track - length estimators can be used throughout the simulation process : this fact is apparently in contradiction with the discussion above about the physical intepretation of the neutron importance - a dimensionless quantity - with respect to a flux - a dimensional quantity",
    ". however it should be clear that when building a transport monte carlo model for the solution of the importance equation we implicitly modify the meaning ( not the numerical value ) we attribute to the adjoint source that in this scheme really corresponds to some pseudo - particle density ; in other words , we build an effective transport model for pseudo - particles whose solution - that is a flux - numerically coincides with the solution for the neutron importance , which instead is dimensionless . as a last remark , it is worth observing that the importance function for the pseudo - particles herewith introduced obeys the direct transport equation , thus establishing a full duality for the two equations , with specular physical meanings .",
    "as an example , for the sake of simplicity , consider @xmath39-wave neutron scattering , for which @xmath40 where @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath42 being the nuclei mass number , and @xmath43 is the standard heaviside unit step function . here",
    "@xmath44 , as it is obvious for scattering processes .",
    "the angular function @xmath45 is the probability density function that a particle colliding at energy @xmath12 and with direction @xmath7 , and being emitted at energy @xmath16 , appears at direction @xmath8 . for the type of scattering considered ,",
    "the @xmath46 function turns out to be simply related to a @xmath47- function , namely @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the scattering angle cosine , uniquely determined by the values of @xmath16 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , for the pseudo - particles `` scattering '' process we have @xmath50 that is not 1 even for a constant scattering cross section @xmath51 - as in such a case @xmath52 : only in the limiting case of infinite mass scatterers we recover the usual interpretation of the pseudo - scattering process .",
    "a simple calculation yields the adjoint energy - angle distribution : @xmath53 a similar situation occurs for pseudo - fission , where : @xmath54 and the isotropic energy - angle distribution is given by @xmath55 in both cases the energy - angle distribution are clearly normalized with respect to the outgoing pseudo - particle energy and angle .",
    "other definitions or choices are however possible ; we mention only one interesting case : we could ask to have an adjoint energy - angle distribution of the same functional form as the original ( forward ) one , at the price of having a mean number of outgoing pseudo - particles which depends not only on their incoming energy , but also on the outgoing one .    in the approach presented in this work the sampling procedure for the adjoint equation proceeds as follows :    1 .   select a pseudo - neutron of initial weight 1 by sampling its initial energy and angle from the energy / angle distribution as it is defined by the external adjoint source distribution , or alternatively select it from a flat distribution and assign an initial weight @xmath56 2 .   select which collision this pseudo - neutron undergoes on the basis of the probabilities @xmath57 ; 3 .   select the outgoing energy and angle @xmath58 from the normalized @xmath59",
    "score appropriate estimators for the adjoint flux ; 5 .",
    "multiply the weight by the mean number of pseudo - particles outgoing from the collision @xmath60 ; 6 .",
    "if @xmath16 is larger than the maximum energy of interest , terminate the history , otherwise go to ( ii ) with the new energy and angle from ( iii ) ; this last point is somehow tricky if one does not select a sufficiently wide energy interval to make negligible the probability that the pseudo - neutron can in the future come back in the energy range of interest : this can happen because of pseudo - fission processes , hence the maximum energy of interest should be chosen so that @xmath61 .",
    "the procedure is essentially the same as in a normal ( forward ) simulation , but for the last point .",
    "the adjoint equation can be analytically solved in a closed form for a classical slowing down model .",
    "this solution allows obtaining valuable reference results , useful to validate the proposed adjoint monte carlo procedure , besides retaining a relevance per se , specially for educational purposes .",
    "the direct flux equation in an infinite medium whose nuclei are characterized by the mass parameter @xmath62 , for s - wave scattering and in the absence of absorption , reads : @xmath63 where @xmath64 equation ( [ eqn : rall ] ) is a slowing down equation because the flux at a given energy @xmath12 receives contributions only from fluxes at higher energies in view of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : swave ] ) , or , that is the same , since no up - scattering is present , the flux at a given energy depends on the values of the flux at higher energies .",
    "the corresponding adjoint equation can be written in a straightforward manner as : @xmath65 since @xmath16 is the energy of a neutron _ outgoing _ from a collision event , it can contribute to the adjoint flux only at a higher energy @xmath12 .",
    "hence the adjoint flux at some energy depends on the adjoint flux at lower energies : consequently , while the flux equation is a _ slowing down equation _ , the adjoint equation has the opposite meaning .",
    "the equation under consideration takes then the following form : @xmath66    let us suppose now that @xmath67 and that @xmath68 . by the equating singular parts , we immediately obtain : @xmath69 or @xmath70 for the adjoint collided part one gets : @xmath71de'\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\theta(e - e_0)\\theta(e_0-\\alpha e)}{e(1-\\alpha)}\\frac{s_0^\\dagger}{\\sigma_s(e_0 ) } + \\frac{1}{e(1-\\alpha)}\\int_{\\alpha e}^e \\phi_c^\\dagger(e ' ) de'.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation clearly admits as a solution @xmath72 for @xmath73 ; the value of @xmath74 can be determined by observing that no neutrons can be present for @xmath73 , then @xmath75 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath76 and hence : @xmath77 a source iteration process yields : @xmath78 since necessarily @xmath79 , then the last integral vanishes if @xmath73 or @xmath80 , or explicitly : @xmath81 this argument can be generalized in order to write : @xmath82 the presence of an overall factor @xmath83 clearly suggests to define @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 in the first interval @xmath86 , since @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath73 , the equation reads : @xmath89 it is quite obvious that a solution to this equation must have the form @xmath90 in fact , one can write : @xmath91,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obtaining : @xmath92 and , at last : @xmath93    in the successive intervals @xmath94 the source term is absent because of the theta function - or because a neutron can gain a maximum fraction @xmath95 of its energy for each collision it suffers , hence : @xmath96 the integral can be split in two terms : @xmath97 so that in differential form one obtains : @xmath98 with initial condition @xmath99    the above is a non homogeneous differential equation for @xmath100 with a source term given by @xmath101 the solution of the associated homogeneous equation is : @xmath102 by the variation of the arbitrary constant , assuming @xmath103 and @xmath104 one obtains : @xmath105 and @xmath106 recalling that @xmath107 is defined over @xmath108 $ ] and that the maximum value allowed for @xmath12 in this case is @xmath109 , we realize that the maximum @xmath110 value is , correctly , @xmath111 .",
