    "one of the fundamental questions of nuclear structure physics is : how many neutrons or protons can we add to a given nuclear isotope before it becomes unstable against spontaneous nucleon emission ?",
    "the neutron - rich side of the nuclear chart , in particular , exhibits thousands of nuclear isotopes still to be explored with new radioactive ion beam facilities @xcite .",
    "another limit to stability is the superheavy element region around @xmath4 and @xmath5 which is formed by a delicate balance between strong coulomb repulsion and additional binding due to closed shells @xcite .",
    "theoretically , one expects profound differences between the known isotopes near stability and exotic nuclei at the neutron dripline , e.g. the appearance of neutron halos and neutron skins , and large pairing correlations .",
    "there are various theoretical approaches to the nuclear many - body problem . for the lightest nuclei , e.g. @xmath6 ,",
    "an exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian in a shell model basis is feasible @xcite .",
    "stochastic methods like the shell model monte carlo approach @xcite may be used for medium - mass nuclei up to @xmath7 . for heavier nuclei , theorists tend to utilize self - consistent mean field theories ; both non - relativistic versions @xcite and relativistic versions @xcite have been developed .",
    "as long as the pairing interaction is relatively weak , it is permissible to treat the mean field and the pairing field separately via hartree - fock theory with added bcs or lipkin / nogami pairing .",
    "this works well near the line of stability @xcite .",
    "however , as one approaches the driplines , pairing correlations increase dramatically and it is essential to treat both the mean field and the pairing field selfconsistently within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) formalism @xcite . while the hf(b )",
    "theories describe the ground state properties of nuclei , their excited states can be obtained with the ( quasiparticle ) random phase approximation ( q)rpa @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the ground state properties of neutron - rich even - even nuclei up to the two - neutron dripline . besides the large pairing correlations already mentioned , hfb calculations face another problem in this region : not only does one have to consider `` well - bound '' single - particle states ( which determine the structure near stability ) , but in addition there are occupied `` weakly - bound '' states with large spatial extent . furthermore , because the fermi energy for neutrons @xmath8 at the dripline , virtual excitations into the continuum states become important for a proper description of the hfb ground state .",
    "all of these features represent major challenges for the numerical solution .",
    "traditionally , the hfb equations have been solved by expanding the quasiparticle wavefunctions in a harmonic oscillator basis @xcite .",
    "this works very well near the line of @xmath9 stability because only `` well - bound '' states need to be considered .",
    "however , as one approaches the driplines , the numerical solution becomes more challenging : in practice , it is very difficult to represent continuum states as superpositions of bound harmonic oscillator states because the former show oscillatory behavior at large distances while the latter decay exponentially . on the other hand , a direct solution of the hf(b ) equations on a finite - size coordinate space lattice",
    "does not suffer from the above - mentioned shortcomings because no region of the spatial lattice is favored over any other region : well - bound , weakly- bound and ( discretized ) continuum states can be represented with the same accuracy .",
    "therefore , the spatial lattice representation has inherent advantages for the theoretical description of exotic nuclei .    using our recently developed hfb lattice code for deformed nuclei far from stability @xcite",
    ", we have investigated the ground state properties of the sulfur isotope chain , starting at the line of stability ( @xmath10 ) up to the two - neutron dripline ( which turns out to be @xmath11 in our hfb calculations ) .",
    "our calculations show both spherical and quadrupole- deformed g.s .",
    "deformations ; in addition , there is evidence for shape coexistence in the very neutron - rich region . in particular , we calculate two - neutron separation energies , quadrupole moments , and rms - radii for protons and neutrons .",
    "our hfb calculations are compared with results from relativistic mean field theory and with available experimental data .",
    "we have also carried out hfb calculations for some recently measured heavier systems : among medium and heavy nuclei , @xmath12zr ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14sm ( @xmath15 ) are among the most deformed isotopes @xcite .",
    "the large deformation could have its origin in the high spin down - sloping orbitals near @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these large prolate deformations at @xmath12zr and @xmath14sm are confirmed by hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations carried out in the present work .",
    "recently , we have solved for the first time the hfb continuum problem in coordinate space for deformed nuclei in two spatial dimensions without any approximations , using basis - spline methods @xcite .",
    "the novel feature of our hfb code is that it is capable of generating high - energy continuum states with an equivalent single - particle energy of hundreds of mev .",
    "in fact , early 1-d calculations for spherical nuclei @xcite and our recent 2-d hfb calculations have demonstrated that one needs continuum states with an equivalent single - particle energy up to 60 mev to describe the ground state properties accurately near the neutron dripline . moreover , recent qrpa calculations by terasaki et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that one needs to consider continuum states up to @xmath18 mev for the description of collective excited states .",
    "it should be mentioned that current 3-d hfb codes in coordinate space , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , utilize an expansion of the quasiparticle wavefunctions in a truncated hf - basis which is limited to continuum states up to about @xmath19 mev of excitation energy .",
    "alternatively , an expansion in a _ _ s__tretched oscillator basis has also been explored @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of our theoretical method has been published in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in the following , we give a brief summary .",
    "in coordinate space representation , the hfb hamiltonian and the quasiparticle wavefunctions depend on the distance vector @xmath20 , spin projection @xmath21 , and isospin projection @xmath22 ( corresponding to protons and neutrons , respectively ) . in the hfb formalism , there are two types of quasiparticle wavefunctions , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are bi - spinors of the form @xmath25    the quasiparticle wavefunctions determine the normal density @xmath26 and the pairing density @xmath27 as follows @xmath28 in the wavefunctions , the dependence on the quasiparticle energy @xmath29 is denoted by the index @xmath30 for simplicity .    in the present work ,",
    "we use skyrme effective n - n interactions in the p - h channel , and a delta interactions in the p - p channel . for these types of effective interactions , the particle mean field hamiltonian @xmath31 and the pairing field hamiltonian @xmath32 are diagonal in isospin space and local in position space , @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the hfb equations have the following structure in spin - space @xcite : @xmath35 with @xmath36    the quasiparticle energy spectrum is discrete for @xmath37 and continuous for @xmath38 @xcite . for even - even nuclei",
    "it is customary to solve the hfb equations for positive quasiparticle energies and consider all negative energy states as occupied in the hfb ground state .",
    "using cylindrical coordinates @xmath39 , we introduce a 2-d grid @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in radial direction ,",
    "the grid spans the region from @xmath43 to @xmath44 . because we want to be able to treat octupole shapes , we do not assume left - right symmetry in @xmath45-direction .",
    "consequently , the grid extends from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "typically , @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 .    for the lattice representation ,",
    "the wavefunctions and operators are represented in terms of basis - splines .",
    "b - splines of order @xmath52 , @xmath53 , are a set ( @xmath54 ) of piecewise continuous polynomial sections of order @xmath55 ; a special case are the well - known finite elements which are b - splines of order @xmath56 . by using b - splines of seventh or ninth oder",
    ", we are able to represent derivative operators very accurately on a relatively coarse grid with a lattice spacing of about 0.8 fm resulting in a lattice hamiltonian matrix of relatively low dimension .",
    "while our current 2-d lattices are linear , a major advantage of the b - spline technique is that it can be extended to nonlinear lattices ( e.g. exponentially increasing ) @xcite which will be particularly useful for problems where one is interested in the behavior of wavefunctions at very large distances .",
    "the four components ( @xmath57 ) of the hfb bi - spinor wavefunction @xmath58 are expanded in terms of a product of b - splines @xmath59    we construct the derivative operators contained in the hamiltonian with the b - spline galerkin method @xcite while local potentials are represented by the collocation method @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of the hfb equations results in a set of quasiparticle wavefunctions at the lattice points .",
    "the corresponding quasiparticle energy spectrum contains both bound and ( discretized ) continuum states .",
    "we diagonalize the hfb hamiltonian separately for fixed isospin projection @xmath60 and angular momentum projection @xmath61 .",
    "note that the number of quasiparticle eigenstates is determined by the dimensionality of the lattice hfb hamiltonian .",
    "for fixed values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we obtain @xmath62 eigenstates , typically up to 1,000 mev .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have investigated the numerical convergence of several observables as a function of lattice box size , grid spacing , and maximum angular momentum projection @xmath63 . in the case of spherical nuclei ,",
    "our calculations have been compared with the 1-d radial hfb results of dobaczewski et al .",
    "@xcite , and indeed there is good agreement between the two .",
    "production runs of our hfb code are carried out on an ibm - sp massively parallel supercomputer using openmp / mpi message passing .",
    "parallelization is possible for different angular momentum states @xmath61 and isospins ( p / n ) .",
    "in this section we present numerical results of our 2d - hfb code and compare these to experimental data and other theoretical methods . in all of our calculations we utilized the skyrme ( sly4 ) @xcite effective n - n interaction in the p - h and h - p channel , and for the p - p and h - h channel we use a delta interaction with the same parameter set as in ref .",
