    "polydisperse fluids have been the focus of a number of studies both theoretically @xcite and via computer simulations @xcite , as well as in experiments @xcite .",
    "these investigations revealed that polydisperse fluids exhibit a very rich phase diagram with shifts in critical point and freezing temperatures , as well as many - solid / fluid coexistence regions @xcite .",
    "the coexisting phases in fact show fractionation , i.e. , the dispersed variable displays a distribution different from the parent in each phase . moreover , polydisperse fluids exhibit terminal polydispersity beyond which the solid is not stable @xcite .",
    "polydispersity is thus regarded as an important factor to improve the glass - forming ability of liquids and to control the liquid fragility @xcite .    predicting the behavior of polydisperse fluids is a complex task , and",
    "several theoretical approaches have emerged to face the challenges of polydisperse fluids ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    ", , , and ) .",
    "the complex nature of the problem is enhanced by the fact that quasi - universal relations@xcite for monatomic fluids , possessing great predictive power , break down in increasingly polydisperse fluids @xcite .",
    "one such example is rosenfeld s excess entropy scaling@xcite in which a dimensionless transport coefficient is correlated to the excess entropy with respect to an ideal gas .",
    "the latter observation for polydisperse fluids stands in contrast to confined fluids where the quasi - universal relations are very robust as the degree of confinement is increased @xcite .",
    "explanations for quasi - universal relations in monatomic fluids were recently presented from a constant - potential - energy _",
    "nvu_-dynamics perspective @xcite , as well as from an exponential pair potential perspective @xcite . in these perspectives ,",
    "the quasi - universal relations are attributed to the monatomic fluids being so - called roskilde - simple @xcite .",
    "roskilde - simple ( rs ) liquids have been detailed in a number of papers @xcite and appear to be simpler than other types of liquids @xcite .",
    "rs liquids are characterized by having strong correlations between virial and potential energy equilibrium fluctuations at constant volume . in simulations of model liquids ,",
    "the single - component lennard - jones ( sclj ) liquid , among many others , has been identified to belong to the class of rs liquids .",
    "some experimental liquids have also been identified as rs @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the class of rs liquids is believed to include most or all van der waals and metallic liquids , but to exclude most or all covalent - bonding , hydrogen - bonding , strongly ionic , and dipolar liquids@xcite . moreover , rs liquids are characterized by having isomorphs .",
    "isomorphs are curves in the phase diagram of rs liquids along which structure , dynamics , and some thermodynamic quantities are invariant in dimensionless units ; a property that is not limited to the stable liquid region but also valid in the supercooled liquid and even out - of - equilibrium@xcite .",
    "recently , bagchi and coworkers@xcite studied lindemann s melting and hansen - verlet s freezing criterion in size polydisperse lj liquids .",
    "the authors showed surprisingly that terminal polydispersity can be analyzed in terms of these rules .",
    "it was also shown that order - parameter maps for these liquids are not independent but highly correlated .",
    "we note that melting and freezing lines of rs liquids are isomorphs from which the rules of lindemann and hansen - verlet follow@xcite .",
    "in fact , correlated order - parameter maps also follow from the existence of isomorphs in the phase diagram@xcite .",
    "the observations of bagchi and coworkers imply that polydisperse lj liquids retain the character of rs liquids .",
    "conversely , the breakdown of quasi - universal relations in polydisperse fluids may imply that polydisperse lj liquids do not remain rs .",

    "rs liquids and their associated simple properties have been detailed in a number of papers , starting with a series of five papers@xcite . rs liquids are characterized by having strong correlations between virial @xmath24 and potential energy @xmath0 equilibrium fluctuations at constant volume .",
    "the virial - potential energy correlation is quantified via pearson s correlation coefficient @xmath25 given by @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is deviation from mean values , @xmath28 denotes _ nvt _ ensemble averages , and @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath25 @xmath30 @xmath31 .",

    "the origin behind strong correlation in the sclj liquid is as follows .",
    "the lj pair potential can be approximated by an ipl potential in the repulsive part@xcite , i.e. , below the potential mininum with an ipl - exponent @xmath36 .",
    "the required exponent is larger than the repulsive term @xmath37 encountered in the lj potential as the effect of attraction is to increase the steepness of the repulsive part .",
    "however , contributions to the fluctuations come from pair distances around the pair potential minimum@xcite . as a consequence",
    ", one must add a linear term and a constant to the ipl potential to obtain a proper description of the lj potential : @xmath38 the constraint of constant volume in the _ nvt _ ensemble has the following effect : when one nearest - neighbor distance increases another one decreases .",
    "thus , upon summation the contribution from the linear term to @xmath0 and @xmath24 is almost constant and vanishes with respect to the fluctuations . for a very recent review of rs liquids ,",
    "see ref . .",
    "as mentioned , rs liquids are associated with a number of simple properties .",
    "rs liquids are , for instance , characterized by having isomorphs to a good approximation@xcite .",
    "consider two state points in a liquid s phase diagram with density and temperature ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "these two state points are defined to be isomorphic if the following holds : whenever a microconfiguration of state point ( @xmath31 ) and of state point ( @xmath43 ) have the same reduced coordinates , @xmath44 @xmath45 = @xmath46 @xmath47 ( @xmath48 denotes a 3@xmath8-dimensional configurational - space vector and @xmath49 , in which @xmath50 is the volume ) , these two configurations have proportional boltzmann factors , i.e. , @xmath51 here @xmath52 is a constant and depends only on the state points ( @xmath31 ) and ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "an isomorph is defined as a continuous curve of state points that are all pairwise isomorphic . for ipl fluids @xmath52 = 1 , and isomorphs thus encapsulate the well - known scaling properties@xcite of these systems .",
    "however , for all other rs liquids @xmath53 ; accordingly , the state points can be represented effectively on a one - dimensional phase diagram only for certain properties @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of isomorphs is that a number of quantities are invariant along these curves .",
    "the invariants include the structure and dynamics in reduced units and some thermodynamic quantities , e.g. , the excess entropy with respect to an ideal gas @xmath54 .",
    "we note that reduced units refer to macroscopic quantities , such as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , rather than the usual approach in simulations via microscopic quantities ( see ref . for details ) .    for rs liquids , temperature separates@xcite in a function of density and of excess entropy : @xmath57 .",
    "from this equation , one observes the isomorph invariant @xmath58 which was used to define the so - called isomorph scaling@xcite , in which the reduced relaxation time @xmath59 is a function @xmath59 = @xmath60 .",
    "isomorph scaling explains classical density scaling@xcite for which @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a fitting exponent .",
    "density scaling is valid only for relatively small density variations , whereas isomorph scaling works even when the density variation is large@xcite .",
    "additionally , the isomorph invariant @xmath58 provides a convenient way to generate isomorphs since @xmath63 inherits the analytical structure of the potential energy function@xcite .",
    "there exist additional simple observations for rs liquids than mentioned so far , e.g. , the dominance of first - coordination shell interactions@xcite , extension to non - trivial boundary conditions such as nanoconfinement@xcite or shear - flow@xcite , crystalline isomorphs@xcite , and the relevance of rosenfeld - tarazona s expressions@xcite for these liquids@xcite .",

    "<S> isomorphs are curves in the phase diagram of rs liquids along which structure , dynamics , and some thermodynamic quantities are invariant in dimensionless units . </S>",
    "<S> we find that isomorphs are a good approximation even for polydisperse lj liquids . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of isomorphs thus extends readily to multi - component systems and can be used to improve even further the understanding of these intriguing systems . </S>"
