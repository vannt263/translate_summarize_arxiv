    "as iot expands its reach across the various aspects of the physical world , we are slowly witnessing its integration within our daily life . in a short period of time",
    ", iot has found manifold and diverse applications , ranging from health care to entertainment , banking to home automation , indoor and outdoor , mobile and stationery .",
    "iot devices in each of these applications have their own constraints . healthcare devices , for example , need to have minimum error - tolerance while power consumption may not be a constraint .",
    "environment monitoring devices on other hand can be more error tolerant but should survive on batteries for a long duration .",
    "this paper proposes a single system on chip with dual mode for ieee 802.15.4 receiver .",
    "the receiver can be configured manually based on the constraints of the application or from the feedback from the built - in snr estimator .",
    "ieee 802.15.4 standard specifies offset quadrature phase shift keying physical layer ( oqpsk phy ) with direct sequence spread spectrum ( dsss ) and half - sine pulse shaping @xcite .",
    "oqpsk with half - sine pulse shaping is equivalent to minimum shift keying ( msk ) signal @xcite .",
    "thus , ieee 802.15.4 phy receiver can also be realized as continuous phase frequency shift keying ( cpfsk ) demodulator .",
    "msk , being a special case of cpfsk , is demodulated non coherently . thus , this type of demodulator do not need carrier frequency and phase synchronization .    as an alternative , at the receiver",
    ", i component of the o - qpsk signal is delayed by half a bit duration to match with quadrature component and then fed to the m - ary psk demodulator .",
    "the coherent qpsk demodulator , though complex to design has excellent error performance .",
    "for an optimum performance , m - ary psk demodulator should be chosen when channel conditions are not favorable and msk demodulator for high snrs .",
    "the proposed receiver employs a simple snr indicator based on the preamble to decide when to switch between the two demodulator chains .",
    "the snr indicator observes the extent to which the received preamble differs from the reference preamble to predict the snr .",
    "msk detectors has been used for ieee 802.15.4 earlier .",
    "@xcite demonstrates a simple low cost receiver using asynchronous zero crossing detector ( azcd ) as a form of msk detector . a maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) based non - coherent msk demodulation",
    "is studied in @xcite .",
    "m - ary psk demodulators with frequency offset synchronization has also been implemented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these detectors performs better in terms of error performance than the msk detectors .",
    "a multi mode transceiver @xcite has also been proposed earlier but it is designed for three different modulation schemes for ieee 802.15.4 . in this paper , a dual mode receiver is proposed where in the receiver can switch between demodulator chains and does not need the modulation scheme of the transmitter to change .",
    "the only improvisation in the transmitter is the differential encoding of the source bit stream .",
    "this is for the reason that differential encoded bits with oqpsk modulation and half sine pulse shaping is exactly equivalent to msk modudlation . if the qpsk demodulator chain is used at the receiver , a differential decoder is used to retrieve original bit stream .",
    "msk demodulator need not use a differential decoder .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , the proposed system architecture is discussed in section ii .",
    "the flow of both the demodulator chain is explained in section iii .",
    "the simulation results is under section iii and section iv concludes the paper with future scope .",
    "the complete architecture of the proposed ieee 802.15.4 receiver is shown in figure [ fig : sys_arch ] .",
    "each of the chains have their own snr estimator that gives feedback to the controller .",
    "based on this feedback , the controller directs the data stream from the adc to one of the demodulator chains .",
    "the digital baseband signal with synchronization errors is given as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the frequency offset , @xmath2 is the phase offset , @xmath3 is the timing error , @xmath4 is the modulated signal and @xmath5 is additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) . as apparent from , the offsets and timing error should be compensated before decoding and decision .",
    "the algorithms used in each of the demodulator chains is explained in the following sub sections .",
    "the offset between in - phase and quadrature - phase components of the oqpsk signal is removed by delaying the _ i _ component to align with _",
    "q _ component in the symbol timing recovery block .",
    "the signal is then be fed to the qpsk demodulator .",
    "a discrete matched filter , @xmath6 $ ] with coefficients equivalent to that of half - sine pulse shape is used to smoothen the pulse of both i and q signals .",
    "@xmath7 = sin(\\frac{\\pi n}{nt_s } ) \\label{half_sine}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since , the half - sine pulse is symmetric , @xmath8 = h[n]$ ] .        early late gate ( elg )",
    "algorithm @xcite is then applied for symbol timing recovery .",
    "elg is a feedback synchronizer and is usually carried on for a fixed number of pulses till an approximate timing interval is achieved .",
    "two additional samples with the main sample is taken , namely early sample and late sample , e and l as shown in figure [ fig : elg ] .",
    "the samples are shifted towards left or right in the next pulse till the main sample is found to be of greater amplitude than both e and l. if l is greater , samples are shifted right , else towards left .",
    "an excellent tutorial of digital frequency offset estimators for m - ary psk modulation is given in @xcite . both the data aided ( da ) and non data aided ( nda ) estimators are explained .",
    "we have used nda estimator because the frequency offset estimation is performed before frame synchronization in our receiver and hence preamble can not be used before that . as discussed in the tutorial ,",
    "r and b algorithm @xcite is the most powerful estimator even at low snrs .",

    "this 32 length preamble is converted to 8 symbols from bit to symbol mapping .",
    "each of these symbols is then mapped to 32 bit chip sequence by dsss , thus giving us a known preamble sequence of 256 bits or 128 qpsk symbols .",
    "a 128 symbol correlator is used to detect the preamble and synchronize the frame .",
    "the payload is then extracted and sent to _ chip to symbol mapping _ and then to _ symbol to bit mapping_.      the msk form of ieee 802.15.4 baseband signal can be considered as :    @xmath16    @xmath17 for msk , @xmath18 are symbols -1,1 derived from bits from i and q components of oqpsk signal and @xmath19 is given by : @xmath20 the continuous phase of msk signal , @xmath21 can be seen in [ fig : msk_phase ] .",
    "the noisy received version is also shown .",
    "as discussed extensively in @xcite , the phase changes by @xmath22 or @xmath23 for every transition of @xmath18 .          the algorithm proposed in @xcite is used for timing correction .",
    "the non - linear transformation of received signal is taken and then averaged over large number of samples to evaluate the timing error , @xmath3 .",

    "differential detection of msk is performed to eliminate the effects of frequency and phase offsets .",
    "this approach was given by tatsuro et .",
    "@xmath31 in @xcite .",
    "the sine of difference of @xmath21 and @xmath32 is evaluated and decision is made by checking the sample just before each transition . if the sample is above 0 , the bit is taken to be 1 , else it is taken to be 0 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : sine_phase ] . the bit stream",
    "is then sent to _ chip to symbol _ and _ symbol to bit _ mapping .          as a novel approach",
    ", frame synchronizer can be used as a crude indicator of snr .",
    "both the receiver chains need to match the chip sequence corresponding to 32 zeros for preamble detection .",
    "after the preamble is detected , a 256-bit comparator can be employed to match the received preamble sequence with original preamble sequence .",
    "a higher snr will yield in more number of matching bits while lower snrs degrade the comparator output .",
    "a threshold is set , output above the threshold indicates a good snr and output below the threshold indicates a lower snrs .",
    "qpsk demodulator is selected for lower snrs and msk demodulator for good snrs . while one chain is processing , the other will sleep .",
    "this adaptive switching between the demodulator chains optimizes the performance of the receiver .",
