    "jet production in neutral current ( nc ) deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) at hera provides an important testing ground for quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the born contribution in dis gives only indirect information on the strong coupling @xmath2 via scaling violations of the proton structure functions . at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath2 additional processes",
    "contribute : qcd - compton and boson - gluon fusion .    in the breit frame of reference  @xcite , where the virtual boson and the proton collide head on , the born contribution generates no transverse momenta .",
    "partons with transverse momenta are produced in lowest order by the qcd - compton and boson - gluon fusion processes .",
    "jet production in the breit frame therefore provides direct sensitivity to @xmath2 and allows for a precision test of qcd .    in this workshop contribution",
    "new measurements of the inclusive jet cross section are presented , based on data corresponding to twice the integrated luminosity and a higher centre - of - mass energy than in the previous h1 analysis  @xcite .",
    "the larger data set together with improved understanding of the hadronic energy measurement significantly reduces the total uncertainty of the results .",
    "the data were collected with the h1 detector at hera in the years 1999 and 2000 . during this period hera collided positrons of energy @xmath3 with protons of energy @xmath4 giving a centre - of - mass energy @xmath5 .",
    "the data sample used in this analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of @xmath6 .    the dis phase space covered by this analysis is defined by @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 quantifies the inelasticity of the interaction .",
    "these two variables are reconstructed from the four momenta of the scattered positron and the hadronic final state particles using the electron - sigma method  @xcite .",
    "the jet analysis is performed in the breit frame .",
    "the boost from the laboratory system to the breit frame is determined by @xmath10 , @xmath9 and the azimuthal angle of the scattered positron .",
    "particles of the hadronic final state are clustered into jets using the inclusive @xmath11 algorithm  @xcite with the @xmath12 recombination scheme and with distance parameter @xmath13 in the plane .",
    "the inclusive @xmath11 algorithm is infrared safe and results in small hadronisation corrections @xcite .",
    "every jet with @xmath14 contributes to the inclusive jet cross section , regardless of the jet multiplicity in the event .",
    "in addition , the normalised inclusive jet cross section is investigated , calculated as the ratio of the number of jets to the number of selected nc dis events in the @xmath9  range defined above .",
    "this observable equals the average jet multiplicity of nc dis events within the given phase space .",
    "jet cross sections and normalised jet cross sections are studied as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath15 .",
    "the following sources of systematic uncertainty are considered : positron energy uncertainty ( @xmath16  to  @xmath17 depending on the @xmath18-impact point of the positron in the calorimeter ) , positron polar angle systematic uncertainty ( @xmath19  and  @xmath20 ) , energy scale uncertainty of the reconstructed hadronic final state ( @xmath21 ) , luminosity measurement uncertainty ( @xmath22 ) . the model dependence of the data correction is below @xmath23 in most of the bins and typically @xmath21 .",
    "an error of @xmath24 is estimated from qed radiative correction uncertainty .",
    "the dominant experimental uncertainties on the jet cross section arise from the model dependence of the data correction and from the lar hadronic energy scale uncertainty .",
    "the individual contributions are added in quadrature to obtain the total systematic uncertainty .",
    "the correlations of the errors among the different bins are taken into account .",
    "for the normalised jet cross sections systematic uncertainties are reduced and the luminosity uncertainty cancels .    the theoretical prediction for the jet cross section",
    "is obtained using the nlojet++ program  @xcite , which performs the matrix element integration at nlo of the strong coupling , @xmath25 .",
    "the strong coupling is taken as @xmath26 and is evolved as a function of the renormalisation scale at two loop precision .",
    "the calculations are performed in the @xmath27 scheme for five massless quark flavours .",
    "the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of the proton are taken from the cteq6.5 m set  @xcite .",
    "the factorisation scale @xmath28 is chosen to be @xmath29 and the renormalisation scale @xmath30 is chosen to be the @xmath15 of each jet .",
    "running of the electromagnetic coupling with @xmath10 is taken into account . in order to calculate the normalised inclusive jet cross sections , the prediction of the inclusive jet cross section is divided by the prediction of the nc dis cross section .",
    "the latter is calculated at nlo , @xmath31 , with the disent package @xcite , and the renormalisation and factorisation scales set to @xmath29 .",
    "the strong coupling is determined by repeating the perturbative calculations for many values of @xmath1 until the best match of data and theory is found . with nlojet++ and disent",
    "these calculations are prohibitively time consuming . a considerable gain in computational speed is provided by the fastnlo package  @xcite .",
    "all theory calculations shown in the following are obtained using fastnlo .",
    "the measured cross sections , corrected for detector and radiative qed effects , are presented as double differential distributions in figure [ fig : sigma ] .",
    "the data points are shown at the average value of the @xmath10 or @xmath15 in each bin .",
    "the results are compared to the perturbative qcd predictions in nlo with @xmath26 , taking into account hadronisation effects and @xmath32-exchange .     for six regions of @xmath10 .",
    "the data , presented with statistical errors ( inner bars ) and total errors ( outer bars ) , are compared with the results of nlojet++ , corrected for hadronisation and @xmath32 boson exchange .",

    "this determination of @xmath1 is consistent with the world average @xmath43  @xcite and with the previous h1 determination from inclusive jet production measurements  @xcite .",
    "the dominating theory error can be reduced at the expense of a larger experimental uncertainty by restricting the phase space of the fit interval to higher values of @xmath10 .",
    "the smallest total uncertainty is obtained by a combined fit of the normalised inclusive jet cross section for @xmath44 : @xmath45 , with a fit quality of @xmath46 .",
    "this result shows a level of experimental precision competitive with @xmath2 determinations from other recent jet production measurements at hera  @xcite and those from @xmath47 data  @xcite and is in good agreement with the world average .",
