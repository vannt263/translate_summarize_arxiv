    "the matrix element of this scet current is @xmath204[q^{3k}\\lambda^{2k } ]     [ q^{-1}\\lambda^{-1 } ]    = q \\lambda^{2k-2 } = \\frac{(\\lambda_{\\rm qcd})^{2k-2}}{q^{2k-3}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this scaling for the matrix element of the hard scattering component of the electromagnetic current agrees with the scaling law derived by brodsky and farrar  @xcite .      in the application of the operator product expansion ( ope ) to inclusive processes",
    "it is useful to classify contributions according to twist .",
    "two common definitions are _ geometric twist _ , @xmath205 , equal to dimension minus spin for an operator , and _ dynamic twist _ , @xmath206 , defined by the @xmath2 scaling by which the matrix element of an operator contributes to the cross section  @xcite .",
    "at lowest order the definitions coincide , @xmath207 . however , beyond twist-2 one has @xmath208 , which corresponds to the fact that operators of a given geometric twist also contribute to higher orders in @xmath209 in the cross section due to wandzura - wilczek contributions  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath1-dimension , @xmath62 , of operators also determines their order in @xmath0 , one might expect that @xmath62 and twist are related .",
    "in fact , dynamic twist @xmath210 .    as",
    "a simple example consider the dis operator in eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) .",
    "recall that collinear fermion fields have twist @xmath211 , which from table  [ table_pc ] is equal to their @xmath1-dimension . in the breit frame the proton momentum @xmath212 and the matrix element  @xcite @xmath213 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath214 and @xmath215 are spin independent quark and antiquark distribution functions .",
    "these distribution functions are related to proton matrix elements of the local twist-2 operators @xmath216 where @xmath217 takes the symmetric traceless combination of the indices @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
    "it is easy to see that the operator @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) corresponds to the @xmath220 part of this @xmath221 tower of completely local operators , @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are collinear covariant derivatives .",
    "the tensor product @xmath225 is symmetric and traceless and picks out the leading symmetric traceless part out of the local operator .",
    "thus , we see that in this example that the twist @xmath207 is identical to the @xmath1-dimension of @xmath53 which is @xmath122 .",
    "next consider the matrix elements of higher order dis operators . in application 2",
    "it was shown that the @xmath1-dimension of an operator has a direct correspondence with the power of @xmath2 in its matrix element .",
    "thus , it is easy to see that a mass dimension-2 operator @xmath226 with @xmath1 dimension @xmath62 has @xmath227 , so that @xmath210 even beyond twist-2",
    ". beyond twist-2 the relationship between @xmath62 with @xmath228 is complicated by the same features that complicate the relationship between @xmath206 and @xmath228 ( for a more detailed discussion see refs .",
    "thus , there is no simple correspondence between @xmath1-dimension and geometric twist .",
    "finally note that the @xmath1-dimension also classifies operators in situations where there is no ope such as for exclusive decays .",
    "in this paper we have given a detailed derivation of the scet vertex power counting formula in eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) , and showed its equivalence with the more intuitive but more tedious direct power counting method .",
    "the vertex formula and @xmath1-dimension of operators make counting powers of @xmath0 in interactions between soft and collinear particles as simple as counting powers of @xmath229 in hqet .",
    "three examples highlighting the power and simplicity of the vertex power counting were then given using the processes of dis , @xmath230 , and @xmath115 .",
    "as a further application we showed how the vertex power counting can be used to determine the powers of @xmath2 and @xmath177 to associate with matrix elements and reproduced the brodsky and farrar result for the @xmath2 scaling of the hard scattering electromagnetic form factor of a hadron . for deep inelastic scattering",
    "we then compared the vertex power counting approach with twist power counting .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the most important utility of eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) is to counting powers of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath177 for power corrections to processes where a priori even the size of matrix elements may otherwise be unknown .      c.  w.  bauer , s.  fleming and m.  luke , phys .",
