    "analytic results are important for several reasons . while numerical integration of the msw equations is straightforward , it becomes extremely tedious when it must be done for a large range of the mixing parameters .",
    "analytic results also allow a greater understanding of the effects of changes in the parameters , and may be useful for extracting information about the solar density from the measured neutrino fluxes .    analytic studies of matter - enhanced neutrino oscillations proceed along two lines .",
    "the first approach is the study of certain densities for which an exact solution for the oscillation probability can be obtained .",
    "the mixing parameters are allowed to be arbitrary .",
    "the exponential density has attracted particular interest , since it approximates the solar density .",
    "a catalog of all of the exactly solvable densities has been presented in ref .",
    "the second approach allows for a general density , but restricts the parameters so that an approximation can be made to the equations of motion , which are then solved exactly .",
    "the approximations are chosen so that the exact results are recovered in either the extreme nonadiabatic or extreme adiabatic limit . in this paper",
    ", we consider a uniform semiclassical approximation to derive the neutrino conversion probability for an arbitrary density .",
    "the solution is exact in the adiabatic limit , like the linear landau - zener result .",
    "however , the new result has a larger range of validity in the nonadiabatic regime . in the body of the paper",
    ", we will discuss how some of the different approximations are related .",

    "second , the pure imaginary terms in the potentials play an extremely important role here , even in the asymptotic regions .",
    "these terms are needed not only to represent nonadiabatic transitions , but also to keep up with the local matter angle .    in this problem ,",

    "however , those interference terms could be important , and we present approximate expressions for them in the next section .",
    "two well - known semiclassical treatments of this problem are via the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) @xcite and linear landau - zener @xcite methods .",
    "the wkb technique _ globally _ maps the `` potential '' discussed above onto the free - particle potential ( i.e. , a constant density ) . by `` global mapping '' , we mean a variable stretching of the axis that deforms the shape of one potential into another .",
    "in fact , the wkb treatment turns out to be identical to the adiabatic approximation @xcite .",
    "the linear landau - zener technique _ locally _ maps onto a linear density ( i.e. , extends a linear profile from a single -msw resonance- point with the right density and derivative ) , and hence a `` potential '' with a parabolic real part and constant imaginary part . while the linear landau - zener result is easy to derive and apply ,",
    "there are two problems .",
    "first , it is notoriously difficult to get the boundary conditions right ( for a complete explanation of how to handle this , see ref .",
    "second , since landau - zener is a point mapping , the expression for @xmath63 is not very accurate . in the case of neutrino oscillations in of the sun ,",
    "the exponential landau - zener approximation circumvents these problems @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the nonadiabatic corrections semiclassically , but with a _",
    "global _ mapping of the `` potential '' , where as in the landau - zener calculation we choose as a model the case of a linear density . by using a global mapping ,",
    "the correct boundary conditions are automatic .",
    "further , the expression for @xmath63 is more accurate .",
    "the approximate wave function is uniformly valid in @xmath40 ( though the approximation is not uniform in the mixing parameters ) .",
    "in the adiabatic limit , only the lowest order is kept in the limit @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hadi ] ) , so the hamiltonian is taken as diagonal ( no hopping from one mass eigenstate to the other ) and the integration is trivial .",
    "the treatment at that order suggests that in order to take into account the probability of hopping , we will need to consider further orders in @xmath13 . in this section",
    ", we will show that it is possible to obtain a rather accurate expression for the electron neutrino survival probability by making a semiclassical expansion , i.e. , by considering only the two lowest orders in @xmath13 when solving the msw equations .",
    "the expressions derived below will hold for values of the mixing parameters from the extreme adiabatic limit up until the extreme nonadiabatic limit . in order to obtain solutions that hold in the extreme nonadiabatic limit",
    ", one would formally have to consider all orders in @xmath13 .",
    "since semiclassical expansions are asymptotic ( i.e. , non - convergent ) in general , it is not clear that this would work in practice .",
    "a much better approach for the extreme nonadiabatic limit is to consider expansions in @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "semiclassical methods ( for reviews , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) are used in quantum mechanics to provide approximate solutions to the schrdinger equation in the limit that @xmath13 is small . as noted , in the wkb method ,",
    "one bases the approximate solutions on free - particle solutions .",
    "a procedure was developed by miller and good @xcite that instead bases the approximate solutions on the known solutions of a schrdinger equation with a similar potential . in this method ,",
    "the turning point singularities of the primitive wkb method are regulated , and the solutions are uniformly valid : they hold over the whole range in @xmath40 and are well - behaved at the turning points .",
    "a further advantage of the miller - good method is that different potentials are treated with the same formalism , i.e. , the method of connection is the same for all potentials with the same number and type of turning points .",
    "the msw equations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : se_e ] ) and ( [ eq : se_m ] ) are schrdinger - type equations for particles in the presence of complex potentials of the form @xmath72 $ ] , with @xmath26 independent of @xmath13 . in the appendix",
    ", we summarize the extension of the uniform semiclassical approximation to treat potentials with this specific dependence on @xmath13 , originally introduced in ref .",
    ". this special form of the potential arises in supersymmetric quantum mechanics ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for discussion .",
    "the method presented in the appendix allows a uniform semiclassical solution for @xmath73 . by `` uniform '' , we mean that the local error incurred by using the approximate solution developed there in the exact differential equation is bounded as a function of @xmath40 .",

    "in contrast , the uniform semiclassical approximation used here is excellent for all but the extreme nonadiabatic limit .",

    "fortunately , one does not generally have to perform any integrations for the parabolic cylinder functions , as only the asymptotic forms are needed .",
    "we will use the asymptotic forms at both the production and detection points . as shown below",
    ", this means that we assume adiabatic propagation at those two points .",

    ", these requirements do not present any difficulties .",
    "consider the sun as an example , with neutrinos produced at the solar center .",
    "if the resonance is near the production point , or there is no resonance , then this implies that @xmath83 is large and the entire propagation is adiabatic , except for extremely small mixing angles .",
    "if the resonance is at a very low density , i.e. , approaching vacuum , then @xmath83 is very small and our approximation breaks down for other reasons described below .",

    "<S> the matter - enhanced oscillations of two neutrino flavors are studied using a uniform semiclassical approximation . unlike some analytic studies which have focused on certain exactly - solvable densities , this method can be used for an arbitrary monotonic density profile . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applicable to a wider range of mixing parameters than previous approximate methods for arbitrary densities . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation is excellent in the adiabatic regime and up to the extreme nonadiabatic limit . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the range of validity for this approximation extends farther into the nonadiabatic regime than for the linear landau - zener result . </S>",
