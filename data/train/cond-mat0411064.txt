    "the field of molecular electronics , which may represent the ultimate limit of the miniaturization of electronic devices , has received much interest in the last decade ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . although the basic idea to use molecules as active elements in electronic circuits is not new @xcite , only recently it became possible to study the conduction of single molecules experimentally ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to metal or semiconductor devices , in molecular electronics the complex structure of a single molecule may be utilized to obtain the functionality of the device .",
    "for example , switching behavior and negative differential conductivity @xcite have recently been demonstrated experimentally and are believed to be a consequence of geometry changes in the conducting molecule .",
    "the tremendous experimental progress has stimulated great interest in the theory and _ ab initio _ modeling of charge transport through single molecules ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , non - equilibrium green s function methods in combination with state - of - the art electronic structure calculations have been employed to study the conductivity of metal - molecule - metal junctions with fixed nuclear geometry .",
    "the dependence of the conductive properties on the binding geometry of the molecular bridge has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "the role of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular bridge in the conduction process and and their effect on the functionality of the device are less well understood .",
    "the `` static '' influence of the internal vibrational modes has been studied by averaging the elastic transmittance over the probability distribution of the vibrational degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the dynamical impact of the vibrational degrees of freedom on the tunneling current in molecular junctions has been investigated within , e.g. , nearest neighbor tight - binding models @xcite .",
    "these studies have demonstrated that the vibrational motion of the molecular bridge may result in additional ( vibrational ) resonance structures in the transmission probability which can alter the current - voltage characteristic significantly .",
    "dynamical effects of nuclear motion on the conductivity have also been observed experimentally .",
    "for example , in experiments on electron transport through @xmath0 molecules between two platinum electrodes @xcite as well as c@xmath1 molecules connected to gold electrodes @xcite , indications for an influence of the center - of - mass motion of the respective molecule on the conductivity have been found .",
    "moreover , the excitation of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule provides a mechanism for heating of the molecular junction and thus is a possible source of instability @xcite .",

    "the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular bridge were described within the harmonic approximation . as an extension of this work ,",

    "ab initio _ calculations of equilibrium geometries of neutral molecules and anions for several related molecules @xcite also indicate that the torsional motion is presumably rather strongly coupled to the tunneling electron . dynamical effect of vibrations beyond the harmonic approximation have been studied for similar systems based on molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , where the nuclear motion was treated classically and the electronic structure was described by a density - functional tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the dynamical effect of the torsional motion on the transport through the bridge within a fully quantum mechanical treatment .",

    "the torsional angle between the two benzene rings is thereby treated as a dynamical variable .",
    "the model parameters are chosen in accordance with available _ ab initio _",
    "data for the biphenyl molecule .",
    "the methods employed to calculate the inelastic transmission probability and the current for this model are presented in section 2.2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss the results of the model study for different parameter regimes and analyze the performance of approximate methods , in particular the purely elastic calculation of the transmission probability and the adiabatic - nuclei approximation .",

    "the energy of an electron in state @xmath2 in lead @xmath35 reads @xmath36 the nearest - neighbor coupling parameter @xmath37 determines the width of the conduction band , which is @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the coupling strength between the last atomic site of the lead and the @xmath5-orbital @xmath40 of the adjacent benzene ring . for simplicity",
    "we assume this coupling to be the same for both leads and independent of the angle @xmath8 .",

    "we obtain the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy @xmath43 on the real energy axis .",
    "the imaginary part ( which is sometimes also called energy - dependent decay width of the resonance state ) is given by @xmath44 inside the conduction band ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 otherwise . in our model studies",

    "the transmission probabilities @xmath73 for zero bias have been calculated according to formula ( [ e : tful ] ) employing a free rotor basis with typically 200 basis functions . to illustrate the results , we average @xmath74 over the lowest four vibrational energy levels @xmath75 ( which are nearly degenerate due to the symmetry of the torsional potential ) , sum over all final states @xmath76 and integrate over the final energy of the electron @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting transmission probability is shown for three values of the coupling strength ( @xmath77 ev , 0.1 ev and 0.2 ev ) in figure [ f : ttot ] .",
    "it is seen that the transmission is essentially nonzero only in the region where the molecular resonance is located .",
    "the process can thus be understood as resonant tunneling of the electron from the left lead to the right lead through the eigenstates of @xmath78 .",

    "the individual states are resolved only for the smallest value of the coupling @xmath77 ev . for larger values of @xmath39 ,",
    "the individual peaks are wiped out due to the stronger coupling with the leads .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the full transmission probability with the elastic one , calculated for frozen vibrations @xmath79       [ \\epsilon_{\\rm f}-\\epsilon_0-\\sigma_2(\\epsilon_{\\rm f})]-\\beta(\\varphi)^2     \\right\\}^2   } .\\ ] ] the elastic transmission function @xmath80 depends on the instantaneous value of the torsional angle @xmath8 .",

    "it is seen that the elastic transmission is much narrower than the full inelastic transmission , thus demonstrating the pronounced broadening effect of the torsional degree of freedom . to investigate if this is a truly dynamical effect or rather the result of the distribution of torsional angles which contribute to the quantum - mechanical initial state @xmath50 , we have averaged @xmath80 over the initial distribution of the torsional angle @xmath8 for temperature @xmath68 .",
    "integrating furthermore over the final energy of the electron , we obtain the expression @xmath83 which in the context of electron - molecule scattering is also called the adiabatic - nuclei approximation @xcite . as the results in fig .",
    "[ f : ttot ] show , the adiabatic - nuclei approximation works very well for the system under consideration except for extremely small coupling to the leads where individual vibrational states of the molecular anion are resolved , which is not reproduced in adiabatic - nuclei approximation .",
    "= 0.8    = 0.8    being based solely on elastic transmission mechanisms , however , the adiabatic - nuclei approximation can not describe the vibrational excitation of the molecular bridge accompanying the transmission of the electron .",
    "this information , which is important to characterize the possible heating of the molecular bridge , is contained in the full transmission probability ( [ e : tful ] ) . as an illustration ,",
    "[ f : distra ] shows the dependence of the inelastic transmission probability ( integrated over the final electron energy ) on the final torsional state for a coupling strength of @xmath82 ev and three different initial energies of the electron . the results exhibit a substantial vibrational excitation of the bridge in the case of resonant electron transmission .",
    "the effect of the electronic coupling strength @xmath39 on this resonant heating process is studied in fig .  [",
    "f : distrb ] .",
    "it is seen that highly excited torsional states are not populated for strong coupling to the leads ( corresponding to a broad resonance ) , although in this case the total transmission probability is larger than for small values of @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "[ f : ttot ] ) .",
    "this result is due to the fact that for strong coupling between molecular bridge and leads the residence time of the electron on the molecular bridge is too short to allow efficient electron - nuclear interaction and thus the total transmission is dominated by the elastic contribution .",
    "= 0.8    in the context of electron transport through molecular bridges , vibrational excitation ( and possibly dissociation ) of the molecular bridge is presumably the most important process induced by the coupling between electron and vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "another interesting process is electron assisted tunneling between the wells of the torsional potential @xmath15 . to study this process",
    ", we consider torsional states which are localized in the wells of the potential @xmath15 .",
    "the potential @xmath15 has four equivalent equilibrium geometries @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : pot ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", combinations of the four nearly degenerate states with lowest energy can be used to obtain states which are localized in the four wells . due to the near - degeneracy ,",
    "these states are close to stationary states . in fig .",
    "[ f : tswap ] we show the transmission probability of the electron starting from a torsional state located at @xmath86 and ending up in the same state ( upper two curves ) or in a torsional state that is localized in the adjacent potential well at @xmath87 ( lower two curves ) .",
    "it is seen that the resonance peak for both processes is located at the same position , the width of the peak , however , is significantly narrower for the lower two curves , i.  e.  for current - induced tunneling between the potential wells .",
    "this can be understood as suppression of the electron transmission due to ( assisted ) tunneling through the torsional barrier .",
    "another interesting result is that the transmission probabilities for the two different processes at energies close to the resonance peak become very similar for smaller coupling ( @xmath88 ev , full lines ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the long - lived character of the molecular anion in the case of small coupling to the leads .",
    "for sufficiently long lifetimes of the molecular anion , the torsional state in the potential @xmath89 has the same probability to decay to both neighboring wells in the neutral potential @xmath90 .",
    "= 0.8      finally , we consider the current - voltage characteristic for our model . to obtain the current for a given voltage via eq .",
    "( [ e : curr ] ) , we have calculated the transmission coefficients ( [ e : tful ] ) for a series of bias voltages on a dense energy grid .",
    "[ f : current ] shows results for different temperatures @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath91 characteristics exhibit a step - like structure . due to thermal broadening",
    ", the width of the step increases with increasing temperature .",
    "it should be emphasized , that this thermal broadening is mainly a result of the thermal excitation of the torsional degree of freedom ( i.e.  eq .  ( [ e : mb ] ) ) , whereas the thermal effect of the electrons ( in eq .",
    "( [ e : fd ] ) ) is almost negligible .",
    "the adiabatic - nuclei approximation ( data not shown ) follows the full calculation closely . for voltages above 0.3",
    "v , the difference is not noticeable . it becomes more apparent close to zero bias .",
    "for example , for @xmath92 k the zero - bias conductivity is @xmath93 , whereas the adiabatic nuclei approximation gives @xmath94 .",
    "this difference is a consequence of the energy loss during the transmission process which is correctly described in the full calculation , but not in the adiabatic - nuclei approximation .",
    "we have analyzed vibrationally inelastic electron transport through a molecular junction in the presence of an anharmonic large - amplitude motion of the molecular bridge .",
    "the study was based on a mechanistic model for a biphenyl molecule between two metal electrodes .",
    "the results of the study demonstrate the effects of electron - vibrational coupling on the transmission probability and the current through the junction . while for small coupling between the molecule and the leads the torsional degree of freedom gives rise to well resolved structures in the transmission function , for stronger coupling it mainly results in a broadening , which increases significantly for higher temperature .",
    "we have , furthermore , studied the vibrational excitation process accompanying the transmission of the electron through the molecular bridge , which is particularly pronounced for electron energies close to the molecular resonance state and/or small to moderate electronic coupling strength .",
    "a correct description of the vibrational excitation process is also important to characterize the heating of the molecule caused by the electron transport . to investigate this heating process in more detail , the coupling to the other vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule ( which were neglected in the present study ) and the environment has to be taken into account @xcite .    another interesting process , which is not related directly to vibrational excitation of the molecular bridge , are structural changes of the bridge , in particular electron assisted tunneling between different wells of the torsional potential .",
    "our studies show that electron assisted tunneling becomes particularly important when narrow resonances are present .",
    "we have also investigated the validity of approximate methods , in particular the purely elastic description of the transmission process and the adiabatic nuclei approximation . as was found in our previous study for models with small amplitude motion @xcite ,",
    "the purely elastic calculation typically predicts much too narrow transmission probabilities .",
    "the adiabatic nuclear approximation , on the other hand , which takes into account the static effect of the vibrational degrees of freedom due to their initial distribution , can describe the average transmission probability rather well , but it is not capable of describing the vibrational excitation accompanying the electron transport .",
    "furthermore , it is also expected to fail if the density of states of the leads varies quickly in the energy range of interest .",
    "this aspect , which is expected to be of particular importance if the molecular bridge is bound to semiconductor instead of metal electrodes will be the subject of future work .",
