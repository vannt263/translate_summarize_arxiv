    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : information_projection ] .",
    "we provide two examples .",

    "the state @xmath69 has maximally mixed @xmath28-body marginals , and of the set @xmath121 , the maximally mixed state has the highest entropy .",
    "second , consider the one - parameter family of states @xmath122 .",
    "all of its two - party reduced states are equal to @xmath123 .",
    "also , @xmath124 has the same @xmath28-rdms and is thus an element of the marginal set @xmath125 .",
    "additionally , @xmath126 is the information projection of @xmath127 onto @xmath2 , as it is the element of maximum entropy in @xmath125 . as known from ref .",
    "@xcite , almost all three qubit states are determined by their 2-rdms , and thus the irreducible three - body correlation is discontinuous at @xmath127 .",
    "more examples can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a last part in this section , we relate the exponential family @xmath83 to the sets of ground and excited states of local hamiltonians respectively . as argued above , nondegenerate ground states of k - local hamiltonians @xmath128",
    "are determined by their k - rdms and belong to the closure of @xmath4 .",
    "nondegenerate excited states of @xmath0-local hamiltonians are completely determined by their @xmath129-rmds @xcite , and are therefore ground states of suitable @xmath129-local hamiltonians @xmath130 .",
    "the argument rests on the fact that any eigenstate of a hamiltonian @xmath131 will also be the ground state of @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the corresponding eigenvalue .",

    "furthermore assume @xmath171 , since we are considering at least three qubits .",
    "from the bounds on the eigenvalues it follows that the entropy of @xmath23 is bounded by @xmath172\\log[1-(d-1)\\delta ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & - ( d-1)\\delta \\log(\\delta ) \\equiv",

    "let us first fix @xmath107 .",
    "taking the second derivative of @xmath174 with respect to @xmath39 one directly finds that this second derivative is strictly negative .",

    "furthermore , the second derivative of @xmath180 with respect to @xmath107 is strictly positive for any @xmath181 , which proves the claim .",
    "let us first consider states of five and six qubits .",
    "we report in table  [ fig : area_numbers ] numerical results for the fraction of pure states lying outside of @xmath22 , with the condition of positive definiteness @xmath39 ranging from @xmath182 to @xmath183 .",
    "we tested @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) random five - qubit ( six - qubit ) states distributed to the haar measure @xcite with our semidefinite program using the solver mosek @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from the table , at least @xmath54 of all tested five - qubit states and @xmath186 of all tested six - qubit states lie outside of @xmath22 .",

    ", we were not able to prove analytically or with the help of the semidefinite program that they have a finite distance to @xmath2 .",

    "the eigenvalues @xmath209 and @xmath210 can be @xmath214 and @xmath215 fold degenerate , with corresponding @xmath216 .",

    "second , considering the set of @xmath219 where @xmath220 one can further see with jensen s inequality that it is optimal to take all of the @xmath211 equal , that is @xmath221 .",
    "so , the whole problem reduces to a problem with four variables , @xmath222 from the conditions it follows that we can choose @xmath223 , which implies that @xmath224 .",
    "we have to prove that the upper bound is is @xmath225 . rewriting @xmath226",

    "as an example , consider an ion chain of four qubits in a linear trap , where the only two - body interactions allowed are of the nearest - neighbor type . then the four - qubit linear cluster state @xmath250 , which is a usual linear cluster state with a permutation of particles @xmath28 and @xmath251 ( see fig .

    "then an argument similar to as in observation @xmath28 can be made .",
    "it is again interesting to see what fraction of states can not be ground states in such a setup .",
    "our semidefinite program shows that @xmath259 of pure states can not be approximated as ground or thermal states of a linear spin chain having nearest - neighbor interactions only @xcite .",

    "<S> it has been shown that the following three characterizations for the information projection @xmath26 are equivalent @xcite :    \\(a ) @xmath25 is the unique minimizer of the relative entropy of @xmath23 from the set @xmath2 , @xmath27 ( b ) of the set of states having the same two - body reduced density matrices ( @xmath28-rdms ) as @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath29 , @xmath25 has a maximal von neumann entropy @xmath30 ( c ) finally , @xmath25 is the unique intersection of @xmath2 and @xmath29 . from ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> it follows that if for a state @xmath31 another state @xmath23 of higher entropy but having the same @xmath28-rdms can be found , then @xmath31 must lie outside of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a further discussion can be found in appendix a  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> states not in @xmath2 are said to have irreducible correlations of order three or higher , because they contain information which is not already present in their @xmath28-rdms , if one wishes to reconstruct the global state from its marginals according to jaynes maximum entropy principle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is conceptionally nice , but also has certain drawbacks . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the irreducible correlation as quantified by the relative entropy is not continuous , as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the relative entropy is difficult to estimate experimentally without doing state reconstruction , so other distances such as the fidelity are preferable . </S>",
    "<S> these properties make the relative entropy somewhat problematic and give further reasons why we consider the convex hull .    </S>",
    "<S> _ characterization via semidefinite programming. _ </S>",
    "<S> our first method to estimate the distance of a given state to the convex hull of @xmath2 relies on semidefinite programming @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this optimization method is insofar useful , as semidefinite programs are efficiently solvable and their solutions can be certified to be optimal . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> ready - to - use packages for their implementation are available .    as a first step we formulate a semidefinite program to test if a given pure @xmath32 state is outside of @xmath2 . from the characterization in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> it follows that it suffices to find a different state @xmath23 having the same @xmath28-rdms as @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath23 is mixed , its entropy is higher than that of @xmath32 , meaning that @xmath32 can not be its own information projection and therefore lies outside of @xmath2 . if @xmath23 is pure , consider the convex combination @xmath33 , again having a higher entropy . to simplify notation we define for an arbitrary @xmath5-qubit operator @xmath34 the operator @xmath35 as the projection of @xmath34 onto those operators , which can be decomposed into terms having at most weight @xmath0 . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 can be computed by expanding @xmath34 in pauli matrices , and removing all terms of weight larger than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath36 may have negative eigenvalues .    </S>",
    "<S> the following semidefinite program finds a state with the same @xmath0-body marginals as a given state @xmath32 : @xmath37   \\nonumber\\\\    \\text{subject to:}&\\quad r_k(\\varrho ) = r_k({| \\psi\\rangle \\langle \\psi| } ) ,     \\nonumber\\\\   & \\quad { \\text{tr}}[\\varrho ] = 1 , \\quad \\varrho = \\varrho^{\\dag } , \\quad \\varrho \\geq \\delta{{\\text{\\usefont{u}{bbm}{m}{n}1}}}\\ , .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{sdptest}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while this program can be run with @xmath38 , it is useful to choose @xmath39 to be strictly positive </S>",
    "<S> . then , a strictly positive @xmath40 may be found , which is guaranteed to be distant from the state space boundary . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , if @xmath32 is disturbed , one can still expect to find a state with the same reduced density matrices in the vicinity of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be used to prove that the distance to @xmath2 is finite , and will allow us to construct witnesses for proving irreducible correlations in @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we make this rigorous in the following observation . for that , let @xmath41 be the ball in trace distance @xmath42 centered at @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> * observation 1 . * _ consider a pure state @xmath32 and a mixed state @xmath43 with @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> then , for any state @xmath31 in the ball @xmath45 a valid state @xmath46 in @xmath47 can be found , such that their @xmath0-party reduced density matrices match . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the entropy of @xmath48 is larger than or equal to the entropy of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the ball @xmath45 contains no thermal states of @xmath0-body hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> _    the proof is given in appendix b @xcite .    in the observation , we considered the trace distance , but a ball in fidelity instead of trace distance can be obtained : consider a state @xmath31 near @xmath32 , having the fidelity @xmath49 , where @xmath50 = { \\langle \\psi| } \\varrho   { |\\psi\\rangle}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> then from the fuchs - van - de - graaf inequality follows @xmath51 and observation  1 is applicable @xcite .    the usage of the fidelity as a distance measure has a clear advantage from the experimental point of view , as it allows the construction of witnesses for multiparticle correlations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the observable @xmath52 has a positive expectation value on all states in @xmath4 and , due to the linearity of the fidelity , also on all states within the convex hull @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> so , a negative expectation value signals the presence of @xmath0-body correlations . </S>",
    "<S> witnesses for entanglement have already found widespread applications in experiments @xcite .    equipped with a method to test whether a pure state is in @xmath22 or not we are able to tackle the question whether the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite can be generalized . </S>",
    "<S> recall that in this reference it has been shown that nearly all pure states of three qubits are uniquely determined ( among all mixed states ) by their reduced two - body density matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this means that they are ground states of two - body hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the closure of the convex hull @xmath22 contains all pure states and therefore also all mixed states , and the semidefinite program in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sdptest ] ) will not be feasible for @xmath39 strictly positive . </S>",
    "<S> the question is whether this result holds for more qubits too </S>",
    "<S> .    concerning pure five - qubit states , we numerically found a fraction of @xmath54 to be outside of @xmath22 . in the case of pure four - qubit states however , no tested random state has been found to lie outside of @xmath22 . given the fact that the test works well in the cases of five and six qubits , this leads us to conjecture that nearly all pure four qubit states are in @xmath22 , and hence also in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this would imply that a similar result as the one obtained by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite holds in the case of four qubits : almost every pure state of four qubits is completely determined by its two - particle reduced density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> more details are given in appendix c @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ characterization via the graph state formalism. _ the family of graph states includes cluster states and ghz states and has turned out to be important for measurement - based quantum computation and quantum error correction @xcite . due to their importance </S>",
    "<S> , the question whether graph states can be prepared as ground states of two - body hamiltonians has been discussed before @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generally , graph states have shown to not be obtainable as unique non - degenerate ground states of two - local hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> further , any ground state of a @xmath0-local hamiltonian @xmath10 can only be @xmath55-close to a graph state @xmath56 with @xmath57 at the cost of @xmath10 having an @xmath55-small energy gap relative to the total energy in the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath58 is the minimal weight of any element in the stabilizer @xmath59 of state @xmath56 ( see also below ) . </S>",
    "<S> but as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this does not imply that graph states can not be approximated in general , as @xmath55 is a relative gap only .    </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce some facts about graph states . </S>",
    "<S> a graph consists of vertices and edges ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ringcluster5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this defines the generators @xmath60 where the product of the @xmath61 runs over all vertices connected to vertex @xmath62 , called neighborhood @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the graph state @xmath56 can be defined as the unique eigenstate of all the @xmath64 , that is @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be rewritten with the help of the stabilizer . </S>",
    "<S> the stabilizer @xmath59 is the commutative group consisting of all possible @xmath66 products of @xmath64 , that is @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the graph state can be written as @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this formula allows to determine the reduced density matrices of graph states easily , since one only has to look at the products of the generators @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> for instance , all stabilizer elements of the five - qubit ring cluster state @xmath69 have at least weight three , and therefore the @xmath28-rdms of @xmath69 are maximally mixed . by choosing @xmath70 in observation @xmath71 , the maximum overlap to @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> is bounded by @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> note that ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has demonstrated a slightly better bound @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> however , both bounds are by far not reachable in current experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one can do significantly better . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will formulate a stricter bound by first considering @xmath2 and the ring cluster state @xmath74 for an arbitrary number of qubits @xmath1 , but the result is general .    </S>",
    "<S> * observation 2 . * _ the maximum overlap between the @xmath5-qubit ring cluster state @xmath74 and an @xmath5-qubit state @xmath75 is bounded by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the dimension of the system . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , for an arbitrary pure state with maximally mixed reduced @xmath0-party states in a @xmath78-system , the overlap with @xmath4 is bounded by @xmath79 . _    the proof is given in appendix d @xcite .    in the case of five qubits , @xmath80 , which improves the bound on the distance to conv@xmath81 by more than two orders of magnitude @xcite . from observation 2 </S>",
    "<S> , we can construct the witness @xmath82 which detects states outside of @xmath22 . in a similar fashion , </S>",
    "<S> any state having the maximally mixed state as @xmath0-particle rdms can be used to construct a witness for @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> first , there is a four - qutrit state with maximally mixed 2-rdms @xcite , which can be used to derive a witness for @xmath22 . the highly entangled six - qubit state @xmath84 ( see the graph in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ringcluster5 ] ) has maximally mixed 3-rdms , so @xmath85 is a witness to exclude thermal states of three - body hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> third , consider a @xmath86 @xmath28d cluster state with periodic boundary conditions ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ringcluster5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this state has @xmath87 @xcite , and can therefore serve as a witness @xmath88 for @xmath89 , where @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that this witness can also be used for @xmath22 , for which the value @xmath91 might be improved @xcite . finally , the minimal distance @xmath92 in terms of the relative entropy from @xmath4 can be lower bounded by the fidelity distance from its convex hull @xmath83 , see appendix d for details @xcite .    _ quantum simulation as an application. _ </S>",
    "<S> the aim of quantum simulation is to simulate a physical system of interest by another well - controllable one . naturally , it is crucial to ascertain that the interactions really perform as intended . </S>",
    "<S> different proposals have recently come forward to engineer sizeable three - body interactions in systems of cold polar molecules @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , ultracold atoms in triangular lattices @xcite , rydberg atoms @xcite and circuit qed systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using the ring cluster state witness @xmath93 derived above , it is possible to certify that three- or higher - body interactions have been engineered . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by letting the system under control thermalise . </S>",
    "<S> if then @xmath94 is measured , one has certified that interactions of weight three or higher are present . </S>",
    "<S> at least five qubits are generally required for this , but by further restricting the interaction structure , four qubits can be enough for demonstration purposes . </S>",
    "<S> this can already be done with a fidelity of @xmath95 , which is within reach of current technologies . </S>",
    "<S> further details can be found in appendix e @xcite .    as an outlook </S>",
    "<S> , one may try to extend this idea of interaction certification to the unitary time evolution under local hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , digital quantum simulation can efficiently approximate the time evolution of a time - independent local hamiltonian and in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite an effective @xmath96-particle interaction has been engineered by applying a stroboscopic sequence of universal quantum gates . </S>",
    "<S> the process fidelity was quantified using quantum process tomography , however it would be of interest to prove that the same time evolution can not be generated by @xmath97-particle interactions only .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion. _ we have provided methods to characterize thermal and ground states of few - body hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be used to test experimentally whether three - body or higher - order interactions are present . for future work </S>",
    "<S> , it would be desirable to characterize the entanglement properties of @xmath2 , e.g. to determine whether the entanglement in these states is bounded , or whether they can be simulated classically in an efficient manner . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is of significant experimental relevance to develop schemes to certify that a unitary time evolution was generated by a @xmath0-body hamiltonian .    _ </S>",
