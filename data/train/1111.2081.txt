    "when core temperatures reach 2.5 to 3.0 mk , lithium depletion begins as its dominant isotope ( @xmath12li ) fuses with hydrogen nuclei to form @xmath13he ( bodenheimer 1965 ) .",
    "convective processes circulate material through the stellar core , depleting all available lithium over timescales of tens of myr ( baraffe et al . 1998 ; song et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) . in spite of its low abundance , @xmath12li",
    "is readily observed in stellar atmospheres in an electronic transition that is a strong doublet at @xmath106707.78 , 6707.93 .",
    "given the short timescale of lithium depletion , the presence of @xmath86708 absorption in the spectra of low - mass stars is recognized as an indicator of youth ( e.g. bonsack & greenstein 1960 ; herbig 1965 ) . stars presumably begin their lives with an amount of lithium consistent with interstellar abundance levels .",
    "anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) derive an abundance of lithium extracted from carbonaceous chondrites of @xmath9(li)=3.31@xmath60.04 dex , which is adopted here as the interstellar @xmath12li abundance level .",
    "hbc 425 ( st 34 ) was first identified as an h@xmath14 emission star in the objective prism survey of stephenson ( 1986 ) .",
    "the star was classified as an early to mid m - type star exhibiting balmer line and @xmath85876 emission by downes & keyes ( 1988 ) . the spectral type was further refined by white & hillenbrand ( 2005 ) to m3 , who determined that hbc 425 is a double - line spectroscopic binary with components of identical effective temperature and luminosity .",
    "hbc 425 lies @xmath11.5@xmath15 from the molecular cloud core l1558 near the southern extremity of the taurus - auriga molecular cloud complex and was subsequently assumed to be a member of the star forming region given its strong t tauri - like attributes .    surprisingly , white & hillenbrand ( 2005 ) discovered that neither component of the double - line spectroscopic binary exhibits @xmath86708 absorption .",
    "the isochronal age of hbc 425 was determined to be 8@xmath63 myr , substantially younger than the predicted lithium depletion timescale of @xmath125 myr using the pre - main sequence models of baraffe et al .",
    "white & hillenbrand ( 2005 ) suggested that a distance of @xmath190 pc would reconcile the discrepancy between isochronal and lithium depletion ages at @xmath121 - 25 myr .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 2005 ) favor this interpretation making hbc 425 the oldest known accreting pre - main sequence star .",
    "given such strong evidence for membership in taurus - auriga , however , white & hillenbrand ( 2005 ) conclude that hbc 425 was likely much younger than implied by lithium depletion .",

    "( 2005 ) obtained a mid - infrared spectrum of hbc 425 using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( werner et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the spectrum revealed substantial excess emission at wavelengths @xmath165.4 @xmath2 m , but the lack of excess emission at shorter wavelengths ( i.e. 2.2 @xmath2 m ) implied the presence of an evacuated inner disk region .",
    "the depleted inner disk would likely result from dynamical clearing by the two components of the spectroscopic binary , similar to the coku tau 4 system that was previously recognized as a transition disk source ( ireland & kraus 2008 ) .",
    "andrews & williams ( 2005 ) place an upper limit on the mass of the circumbinary disk of @xmath175@xmath1810@xmath19 m@xmath7 .",
    "the kinematic survey of taurus - auriga by bertout & genova ( 2006 ) found insignificant proper motions for hbc 425 as well as for 10 other assumed taurus - auriga members including coku tau 4 , dq tau , and v836 tau .",
    "while purely circumstantial in nature , the lack of significant proper motion may argue in favor of a larger distance estimate for hbc 425 , i.e. more consistent with the distance of taurus - auriga .    in this work we present near - infrared , adaptive optics imaging and spectroscopy of hbc 425c , an apparent low - mass companion positioned @xmath0 southeast of the spectroscopic binary .",
    "this component was first noted by white & hillenbrand ( 2005 ) who estimated it to be @xmath12.5 magnitudes fainter than the primary in @xmath5band .",

    "we also present high dispersion optical spectra of hbc 425 and hbc 425c and use these spectra to examine the kinematics of the system and to place limits on the abundance of lithium present in their photospheres .",
    "the near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ; mclean et al . 1998 ) installed behind the adaptive optics system of keck ii ( nirspao ) was used on 2010 december 12 to obtain moderate - dispersion ( @xmath3 ) @xmath20 and @xmath5 band spectra of hbc 425 and hbc 425c .",

    "the stars were nodded along the slit and observed in 3 positions to ensure proper sky subtraction and reasonable signal to noise levels in the extracted spectra .",
    "integration times were 180 and 120 s in the nirspec-3 and nirspec-7 filters , respectively .",
    "flat lamp and argon arcline spectra were obtained for each instrument configuration to remove pixel to pixel variations and for wavelength calibration . a nearby , bright a0 v star ( hd 35036 )",
    "was observed immediately after hbc 425 in each filter for telluric correction .",
    "basic image reduction , spectral extraction , and wavelength calibration were achieved using redspec , an analysis package written by l. prato , s. kim , and i. mclean that is publically available through the nirspec webpage .",

    "the platescale of scam is 0.0168 arcsec per pixel , yielding a nominal field of view of 4@xmath223 square .",
    "integration times per coadd were 1 s or less to maintain linearity , requiring the use of correlated double sampling ( cds ) readout mode .",
    "detector read noise in cds mode is @xmath110 e@xmath23 .",
    "the field was dithered with hbc 425 and hbc 425c off the slit in several positions to allow for sky and dark current subtraction .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on hbc 425 and hbc 425c using the _ phot _ task in the daophot package of iraf on sky - subtracted images .",
    "an aperture radius of 10 pixels ( 0@xmath22168 ) was adopted for the analysis .",
    "photometric uncertainties are represented by the standard deviation of measurements on several sky - subtracted frames in each filter .",
    "absolute photometric calibration was achieved by using the 2mass @xmath20 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25band magnitudes for hbc 425 .",

    "the h & k lines ( j2010 ) are double - peaked , but while strongly in emission the features are narrow and lack the broadened wings evident in the balmer lines .",
    "these emission peaks are consistent with the velocities of the primary and secondary , implying that they arise from chromospheric activity associated with each component .",

    "<S> we present high angular resolution , near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy of a low - mass companion to the lithium - depleted , double - line spectroscopic binary hbc 425 ( st 34 ) obtained using the near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ) and the keck ii adaptive optics system . </S>",
    "<S> positioned @xmath0 southeast of the primary pair , the companion , hbc 425c , is @xmath12.4 magnitudes fainter at 2.2 @xmath2 m . </S>",
    "<S> moderate - resolution ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 and @xmath5band spectroscopy reveal hbc 425c to have an m5.5 ( @xmath60.5 ) spectral type . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons with pre - main sequence evolutionary models imply a mass of @xmath10.09 m@xmath7 and ages of 810 myr , assuming the nominal distance of taurus - auriga ( @xmath1140 pc ) , or @xmath125 myr if placed at @xmath190 pc . </S>",
    "<S> we also present high dispersion , optical spectra of hbc 425 and hbc 425c obtained using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) on keck i. we detect strong @xmath86708 absorption in the spectrum of hbc 425c . using curves of growth for the @xmath86708 doublet </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate its abundance level to lie between log @xmath9(li)=1.9 and 3.1 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of hbc 425 exhibits h & k , @xmath105876 , 6678 , and strong balmer line emission , consistent with accretion . </S>",
    "<S> we place more restrictive upper limits on the surface abundance of lithium and find that hbc 425 retains less than @xmath10.1% of its primordial abundance . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of lithium in the photosphere of hbc 425c does not resolve the discrepancy between isochronal and lithium depletion ages for the primary pair . </S>",
    "<S> however , if lithium were depleted relative to interstellar abundance levels , even minimally , considerable support would be gained for the more advanced age of this hierarchical triple system . </S>"
