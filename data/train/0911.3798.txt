    "we analyse two specific issues that are important for the appearance of pulse - averaged profiles of pulsars : 1 ) the radial extent of a region emitting at a given radio frequency , and 2 ) the asymmetry about the magnetic axis of the curvature of electrons trajectories measured in the observer frame . the influence of both of these factors on profile shape is closely associated with the rotation of the magnetosphere , so they should be most noticeable for rapidly rotating objects such as the millisecond pulsars ( msps ) . unlike normal pulsars",
    ", msps do not exhibit radius - to - frequency mapping ( rfm , see figs .",
    "16 and 17 in kramer et al .",
    "this might possibly be interpreted as near - surface emission with negligible radial extent ( mcconnell et al .",
    "however , dyks , rudak & demorest ( 2009 ) have shown that at least some components in radio pulse profiles are produced when our sightline cuts through the curvature emission from radially - extended plasma streams . in this stream - cut scenario , the observed location of a component",
    "is determined by the frequency - independent moment at which our line of sight crosses the plane of a thin stream .",
    "when this happens , the component becomes simultaneously recorded at all frequencies that are emitted at the altitude of the cut .",
    "there is no rfm , because positions of components are fixed by the geometry of the cut .",
    "this interpretation requires that a broad range of radio frequencies is emitted by the stream at a fixed altitude .",
    "such a possibility arises naturally in the stream - cut scenario , because density of plasma in a stream decreases in the transverse direction from the stream axis .",
    "therefore , regardless of the altitude that is considered , a broad range of plasma densities ( and plasma frequencies ) is available at different transverse distances from the stream axis .",
    "it is then possible to have a radially - extended emission region ( a stream ) which provides a range of plasma frequencies at each altitude ( the ` radius - to - frequency ' mapping is replaced with the ` stream - diameter - to - frequency ' mapping ) .",
    "thus , the radially - extended emission at a fixed radio frequency is possible without violating the foundation of the rfm idea , that relates the observed frequency to the local plasma frequency at the emission point .",
    "the effect of rotation on a radially - extended source can be expected to make intrinsically symmetric pulse profiles appear asymmetric with respect to their centre , changing the phases of their components , their intensities and their widths . in the following section ( [ widths ] ) we introduce a simple ( small - angle ) analytical model to determine the likely observable effects in the profiles of fast - rotating pulsars with emitting regions of finite height .",
    "these caustic effects are well studied _ numerically _ and are routinely employed to interpret high - energy pulse profiles of pulsars ( morini 1983 ; smith 1986 ; romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ; cheng et al .",
    "2000 , dyks & rudak 2003 ) . here , however , we focus on the _ analytical _ study of the phenomenon , which is feasible for low emission altitudes ( @xmath0 ) or small distances from the dipole axis .",
    "this limitation therefore allows possible applications to the radio profiles as well as to specific gamma - ray peaks , eg .",
    "those generated by the trailing caustics of the two - pole caustic model .",
    "the results are used to create artificial but instructive pulsar profiles in section ( [ models ] ) . in section ( [ intensity ] ) we analyse the curvature of the particle trajectories and examine the impact of considering curvature radiation on model profiles .",
    "then , in section ( [ msp ] ) , we see how far our results can model the main pulse profile of j1012 + 5307 .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section ( [ conc ] ) .",
    "our ` simplest case ' model for an averaged pulse profile is limited to the plane of the rotational equator ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the viewing angle measured from the rotation axis @xmath3 ) , and assumes the orthogonal inclination of dipolar magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the @xmath5-field in the cf is assumed to have the shape of the static dipole .",
    "the radio - emission region is assumed to have the form of a flaring tube / funnel with negligible thickness .",
    "it is radially extended , but limited to a single value of the footprint parameter @xmath6 and it is symmetric with respect to the @xmath7-plane ( the fiducial plane ) .    in the cf the radiation from the radial position @xmath8",
    "is emitted at the angle @xmath9 with respect to the dipole axis @xmath10 , where the footprint parameter @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the angle between @xmath8 and @xmath10 , @xmath13 is the @xmath12-coordinate of the last open field lines at the same radial distance @xmath14 .    the radiation emitted on the leading side ( ls ) of the dipole axis is therefore detected at the phase @xmath15 where the term @xmath16 accounts for the leftward shift caused by ar effects , ie .  the aberration ( contributing one @xmath17 ) and the retardation ( contributing another @xmath17 ) . the symbol @xmath18 denotes the absolute fiducial phase , determined by the detection of a photon emitted from the center of the ns exactly at the moment when the dipole axis was in the @xmath3-observer plane ( see dyks 2008 for details ) .",
    "the radiation on the trailing side ( ts ) of the dipole axis is detected at the phase : @xmath19 the opposing signs of the @xmath14-dependent terms in eq .",
    "mean that on the ts the ar effects tend to cancel the effect of the curvature of @xmath5-field lines , leading to specific caustic effects .",
    "in fact , for arbitrarily large @xmath14 it is easily possible for the ts - radiation to arrive / be observed on the _ leading _ side of the profile ( especially if @xmath6 is small ) .",
    "let us consider electrons moving upward along a magnetic field line with parameter @xmath6 on the ts of the open region . as their altitude increases , their radiation is detected at progressively later phases until , at an altitude of @xmath20 , an increment in height of an electron s trajectory yields an increase in the linear term in eq .   which is greater than that of the square root term .",
    "emission is then detected at the phase @xmath21 , which is ` the latest - possible detection phase ' for a magnetic fieldline with a given @xmath6 , because further increase in @xmath14 does not produce any advance in detection phase .",
    "for still larger altitudes , the radiation becomes detected at phases _ earlier _ than @xmath21 . at phases satisfying @xmath22",
    "it is therefore possible to observe radiation from particles at two different emission altitudes on the _ same _ fieldline ( because the quadratic eq",
    ".   for @xmath14 has two real roots )",
    ".    for a given @xmath6 the height @xmath20 and phase @xmath21 can be found by using eq .   to solve the equation : @xmath23^{1/2 } - 2\\right)= 0 , \\label{phderiv}\\ ] ] which gives the magnetospheric location of the optimally caustically - enhanced emission : @xmath24 then , from eq .",

    "the terms of eq .",
    "have opposite signs which makes @xmath41 whenever @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "because of this , the radiation on the ts ` piles up ' within a narrower phase range than on the ls and becomes intensified .    if we interpret eqs .   and as component widths generated by the same fieldline @xmath6 on the ls and ts respectively , then we may compare them by expanding eqs .   and about any emission radius @xmath14 with @xmath44 , giving @xmath45^{1/2 } -",

    "since both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are to first order linear in @xmath49 , the profile asymmetry does not depend on @xmath49 ( the measure of the asymmetry is the ratio of fluxes on the ts and ls : @xmath50 , see eq .",
    "[ primitive ] below ) .",
    "thus , assuming the emissivity in the cf is roughly symmetric with respect to the @xmath7-plane , one can not change the relative intensity of the ls and ts by adjusting the emitter s radial extent @xmath49",

[ rcst ] ) , is zero and the remainder has a sign depending on @xmath61 , giving @xmath62 this expression is independent of @xmath6 , except indirectly through @xmath63 .",
    "thus the minimum component width is attained at @xmath64 , where the upper and lower phase shifts exactly overlap .",
    "the results of this section are likely to have important implications for understanding msp profiles because , as mentioned earlier , these pulsars are thought to have deep emission zones ( i.e. large @xmath65 ) and hence caustic effects can be expected at a wide range of phases @xmath66 , creating narrow , bright components on the ts in contrast to the broad dimmer features on the ls . in any pulsar of given period and with fixed @xmath51 and @xmath52 , there will be a definable _ caustic zone _ in its profile where component narrowing and intensification might be expected .",
    "its range is given by    @xmath67    note this result does not depend on the absolute value of the emission heights , and will be greatest for pulsars with narrow light cylinders .",
    "the more strongly a given component is compressed by ar effects , the larger will be the radio flux observed at the maximum of that component .",
    "thus , assuming uniform emissivity , the phase - dependent flux ( profile shape ) can be estimated as : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a width of a component located at pulse phase @xmath70 .",
    "the quantity @xmath71 represents the flux at the maximum of that component .",
    ".   will be satisfactory across most of the profile ( always including the ls ) , so that we are able to use the first - order eqs .   and",
    ". however , eq .   can not be used in a direct vicinity of the caustic coordinates .",
    "this is because our model assumes an unphysical radiation pattern ( the delta function along the electron velocity ) .",
    "this leads to the infinite value of the phase - resolved flux at @xmath72 .",
    "the infinity appears because for @xmath49 decreasing down to zero around @xmath29 , the amount of radiation emitted ( proportional to @xmath49 ) , decreases slower than the detection interval @xmath73 ( eq .  [ dphitcst2 ] ) .",
    "although this result is formally correct , it is unphysical because locally the radio waves are emitted into a solid angle of finite width @xmath74 . near the caustic coordinates , that is , for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the phase interval @xmath48 becomes negligible in comparison to @xmath74 .",
    "in such a case , the flux observed at @xmath77 becomes determined by the solid angle of the elementary beam ( @xmath78@xmath79 ) , and by @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the equation [ primitive ] is not applicable to the caustic points of the magnetosphere and can not be used to reliably predict the phase - resolved flux at the caustic phase [ @xmath80 .",
    "such caustic effects have already been numerically explored in discussions of the few pulsars found to have high energy profiles .",
    "eq .   is therefore the small - angle equivalent of the phase at which the leading peak of the two - pole caustic or slot - gap model occurs ( dyks & rudak 2003 ; muslimov & harding 2004 ) .",
    "this leading gamma - ray peak is emitted from low altitudes on the trailing side of the polar tube and lags the main radio pulse by @xmath81 , if the closest pole is viewed at a small impact angle ( @xmath82 ) . in this case",
    "the phase location of this gamma - ray peak is given by eq .",
    "of the appendix [ nonorth ] for arbitrary dipole inclinations @xmath83 .",
    "to illustrate the observable effects of ar on a millisecond pulsar we generate artificial profiles for a pulsar assumed to have a period of 5.25 ms and to radiate its emission between heights of @xmath84 cm ( approximately the neutron star surface ) and @xmath85 cm .",

    "and this gives @xmath92 and @xmath93 , i.e.  the leadingmost component is 5 times broader than the trailingmost . the second ( fig .",
    "[ profis]b ) has narrower cones and the merging of components is more comprehensive on the ls . in both cases ,",
    "the radial extent causes the ls profiles to assume a ` boxy ' shape so that even with widely spaced cones the stretched components overlap and false ` components ' can be created ( marked ` o ' in fig .",

    "it can also be seen that the stretched components do not always fully merge with each other , so that a single notch can appear ( marked ` n ' in fig .",

    "single notches in boxy profiles were described by cordes ( 1975 ) for b1919@xmath9421 .",
    "simulated polarisation profiles ( not shown ) demonstrate that the overlap does not lead to any depolarisation , because the overlapping components have similar polarisation angle ( and our code assumes they have the same intrinsic polarization degree ) .",
    "by contrast , the ts components are clearly narrowed and become separated . from eq .",
    "it follows that strong caustic effects will be observed on fieldlines with @xmath6 between 0.53 and 0.75 at phases between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "this is mainly because the true position of the fiducial phase within the pulse is unknown and the pulsar s angle of inclination , which affects our calculation through the generalised forms of eqs .   and ( see appendix a ) , is not easy to estimate",

    "the corotation increases the curvature of electron trajectories on the ls of the mp , whereas it decreases the curvature on the ts ( ahmadi and gangadhara 2002 ; dyks 2008 ) .",
    "the question of how this affects radio emissivity is a complicated one , because it depends on details of the amplification process .",
    "one one hand , one can qualitatively argue that the smaller curvature ( larger curvature radius ) makes the amplification more efficient , because the electrons following less - curved @xmath5-field interact with narrow beams of radiation for a longer period of time . on the other hand , for the coherent curvature emission from bunches of @xmath138 charges ,",
