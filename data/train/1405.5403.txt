    "it is well known that diluted polymers in bad solvent conditions may undergo a conformational transition from the swollen ( extended ) phase to a globular one  @xcite . in the last decades",
    "this so - called _ collapse transition _ has been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies that have been essentially focused either on the swollen phase or on the nature and scaling properties of the collapse ( @xmath1 ) transition  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "very little is known about polymers in the globular phase  @xcite , despite the study of their statistics can help in understanding the conformational and thermodynamic properties of more complex forms of compact polymers such as proteins in native states .",
    "if one is mainly interested in the scaling behavior of either metric or thermodynamics observables ( including critical exponents ) of collapsing polymers , a good model to consider is the class of @xmath2-site interacting self - avoiding walks ( isaws ) , namely , non self - intersecting walks of @xmath2 sites on bravais lattices with an attractive interaction between adjacent non - bonded sites . indeed , by tuning this attraction in terms of an effective temperature @xmath3 , isaws display a collapse transition towards a globular phase whose thermodynamics is governed , in the limit of large @xmath2 , by the scaling behavior of the partition function  @xcite @xmath4 ( such structure is also supported by theoretical results for partially directed isaws  @xcite and for dense polymers  @xcite ) . in  ( [ zn ] ) the connective constant @xmath5 and the amplitude @xmath6 of the correction to scaling",
    "are model dependent quantities and function of @xmath7 , whereas the ( entropic ) exponent @xmath8 is a universal ( i.e.  model independent ) critical exponent whose value depends only on dimension ( @xmath9 ) and on polymer topology ( for instance linear , circular , knotted etc ) .",
    "note in  ( [ zn ] ) the presence of the term @xmath10 that describes the surface penalty contribution ( @xmath11 for @xmath12 ) related to the higher free energy acquired by the monomers exposed to the solvent  @xcite .",
    "the presence of this surface renders the asymptotic analysis of the thermodynamics of globular polymers more complicated than that for dense polymers , at least for two reasons : first , the presence of the additional unknown parameter @xmath13 increases the complexity of the analysis of the scaling law  ( [ zn ] ) .",
    "second , there is strong numerical evidence that the surface generates strong corrections to scaling when linear polymers are considered  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that configurations with one or both ends on the surface of the globule surface have different entropic exponents with respect to those where both ends are in the interior of the globule , the latter become asymptotically relevant only for long chains .",
    "this effect has been observed for @xmath14 globules  @xcite and should be even more pronounced for globular polymers in @xmath15 , where the surface / volume ratio is larger than in two dimensions .",
    "a way to get around this problem consists for instance in looking at globular rings .    scaling laws such as  ( [ zn ] )",
    "are usually studied numerically by @xmath2-varying ( grand - canonical ) monte carlo approaches  .",
    "an example is the so called bfacf algorithm   ( from the initials of the authors ) , a set of local moves including the deletion / addition of a few monomers along the walk .",
    "being ergodic within the class of rings with a given knot type  , this algorithm has also been extensively used to study the effect of topological constraints on the asymptotic properties of knotted rings in the swollen phase  @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that its straightforward application to the globular phase fails to reproduce the @xmath2-varying statistics with a controlled average number of monomers @xmath16 if @xmath2 is sufficiently large  @xcite , a condition to achieve for studying the scaling law  ( [ zn ] ) properly .    here",
    "we introduce a stable numerical scheme to study the large @xmath2 behavior of globular polymers .",
    "this is applied on a model of interacting polymer that from now on we refer to as an _ interacting elastic lattice polymer _ ( ielp ) .",
    "the ielp can be seen as an extension of the elastic lattice polymer ( elp ) , a model that has been introduced to study dynamical properties of linear polymers  @xcite and more recently extended to investigate the equilibrium properties of rings in the swollen phase  @xcite . briefly",
    "( see the next section for a better definition of the model ) an @xmath17-monomer ielp is an isaw where locally the self - avoiding condition can be partially relaxed by allowing some consecutive monomers to condense on the same lattice site . in this respect",
    "the @xmath17 monomers of an ielp are elastically stored along an isaw backbone with fluctuating length @xmath18 .",
    "this additional degree of freedom , not present in the standard isaw model , can then be tuned to better stabilize the average length @xmath16 when @xmath2-varying algorithms are used in stochastic sampling . moreover , by restricting the sampling to circular ielps ( rings ) , the aforementioned finite - size corrections , due to the positions of the polymer ends with respect to the globule surface , can be avoided . finally , by looking at the asymptotic behavior of the equilibrium averaged stored length density @xmath19 we have access to the full scaling law  ( [ zn ] ) and we are able to estimate its parameters in the globular phase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  ii we introduce the ielp model and its asymptotic behavior in the globular phase .",
    "in particular we show how to extract information on the @xmath5 , @xmath13 , and @xmath8 exponents by extrapolating the average stored length density @xmath20 for large @xmath17 values . in section",
    "iii we describe the @xmath2-varying monte carlo algorithm used to sample closed ielps on the hypercubic lattice and its implementation on a multiple markov chains scheme , an additional stochastic procedure known to increase the mobility of the sampling for compact configurations . in section",
    "iv we show the results obtained for collapsed rings , ending with some conclusions in section  v.",
    "a commonly used model to study numerically the polymer collapse transition is the isaw , namely a saw augmented with an attractive energy @xmath21 equal to the number of contacts ( non - bonded pairs of nearest - neighbors sites of the saw ) .    in the grand - canonical ensemble",
    "the large @xmath2 behavior of isaws is governed by the singularities of the generating function @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the _ step fugacity _ , @xmath7 the inverse of the temperature and @xmath24 is the canonical partition function associated with the number of @xmath2-sites isaws with energy @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the singularities of  ( [ gen_1 ] ) develop as @xmath27 and monte carlo algorithms based on the bfacf moves must bring the value of @xmath23 as close as possible to @xmath28 to get a good statistics of configurations with large @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately a straightforward application of the bfacf algorithm in the globular phase meets a difficulty . indeed , due to the presence of the surface term @xmath29 in  ( [ zn ] ) of @xmath30 , the grand - canonical average @xmath31 does not grow continuously to @xmath32 as @xmath27 but instead jumps discontinuously to infinity right at @xmath33 , making the sampling of long walks quite unrealistic  @xcite .",
    "monomers and @xmath34 sites ( left ) sharing the @xmath2-sites saw silhouette ( right ) .",
    "dashed lines represent the energetic contacts associated to that configuration.,width=302 ]    in order to allow the number of sites @xmath2 to fluctuate and grow in a rather controlled way we introduce the ielp model , an extension of the elp model for saws in which self - attracting interaction is taken into account . as in the elp model ,",
    "the idea is to accommodate @xmath35 monomers on an underlying @xmath2-site saw silhouette drawn on a lattice . to maintain the connectivity constraint of a polymer chain , at least one monomer resides in each site of the underlying @xmath2-site saw and only consecutive monomers",
    "can share the same lattice site ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .    certainly one could sample ielps by updating the position of all @xmath17 monomers within the lattice  @xcite .",
    "however , this level of detail is not necessary when the energy function depends only on the @xmath2-sites isaw silhouette : in this case it is sufficient to sample directly the isaws backbone with rates that take into account the degeneracy of each isaw configuration . since for each @xmath2-site isaw",
    "there are @xmath36 possible ielps , the total weight associated with an ielp configuration with @xmath17 monomers , @xmath2 lattice sites and @xmath25 contacts , is given by @xmath37 by summing over all possible values of @xmath25 and @xmath2 compatible with @xmath17 we obtain the generating function of ielps with @xmath17 monomers @xmath38    note that , when @xmath17 and @xmath23 are both kept fixed , the number of sites @xmath2 oscillates around an average @xmath39 that scales linearly with @xmath17 , with fluctuations of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "this property , as we will show below , is very helpful in sampling long walks undergoing a @xmath1-collapse .",
    "a second advantage in sampling ielps is the possibility of estimating @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath8 by computing the asymptotic of the mean stored length density  ( [ rhom ] ) within a saddle - point approximation  @xcite . to show this we first notice that , by defining @xmath43 and substituting the scaling  ( [ zn ] ) in  ( [ z_ielp ] ) , the average @xmath16 can be computed by using the relation @xmath44",
    "if the partition function of isaws were simply @xmath45 , one would get the exact expression @xmath46 $ ]  @xcite .",

    "since the monte carlo algorithm for ielps is based on the bfacf moves , its ergodicity is a direct consequence of the one already proven for bfacf  .",
    "the monte carlo scheme samples isaws configurations according to the statistical weight  ( [ weight ] ) of ielps ; it is then enough to require that the rate of jump @xmath62 from a configuration @xmath63 to a configuration @xmath6 satisfies the detailed balance condition @xmath64 . from eq .",
    "( [ weight ] ) we get @xmath65    -site configuration @xmath63 to an @xmath66-site configuration @xmath6.,width=188 ]    we now specialize the discussion to @xmath17-monomers circular ielps , whose underlying silhouette is given by a @xmath2-steps self - avoiding polygon ( sap ) on a @xmath9-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice .",
    "note that in this case the periodicity in monomer labeling requires @xmath67 with the number of monomers equal to the number of steps .",
    "the bfacf moves that need some care in their implementation are those changing the number @xmath2 of monomers .",
    "these are based on the addition / removal of a crankshaft bulge : in such a motif a site @xmath68 along the chain is a nearest neighbor of site @xmath69 and , together with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , they form a unit square on the hypercubic lattice ( see a @xmath14 example in fig .  [ fig02 ] ) .",
    "the addition / removal of two sites connects the ensemble of saps with @xmath72 sites to that of saps with @xmath73 sites .",
    "accordingly , equation  ( [ db ] ) simplifies to @xmath74 in practice a local update @xmath75 that proposes the addition of two monomers is implemented by choosing , with uniform probability @xmath76 , one of the @xmath2 bonds of polygon a. then one of the @xmath77 possible directions orthogonal to the chosen bond , @xmath78 , is picked up with probability @xmath79 .",
    "the reverse update @xmath80 is implemented accordingly by choosing a bond of the polygon b with probability @xmath81 . by calling @xmath82 and",

    "these frequencies can be chosen to satisfy the detailed balance  ( [ db ] ) . by choosing @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    "we get @xmath90 with this choice the acceptance probabilities become @xmath91 where we have defined the ratio @xmath92 note that @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 otherwise .    in the spirit of a metropolis criterion ,",
    "the idea is to maximize both @xmath82 and @xmath83 compatibly with the above constraint on @xmath96 .",
    "ideally , one of the two should be equal to @xmath97 .",
    "the following acceptance rates of the proposed move @xmath98 and @xmath99 satisfy the above requirements for any value of @xmath2 : @xmath100 hence , for a @xmath9-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice , when the frequency of proposed moves that increase the number of steps from @xmath2 to @xmath101 , @xmath86 , is @xmath77 times the frequency of the reverse moves ( @xmath87 ) , we can apply the filters ( 23)-(24 ) to accept them . for an efficient implementation of the algorithm",
    "once , say , the move @xmath98 is proposed , it is more convenient to pass first the filter equal to @xmath102 and then , after the self - avoidance test is passed , accept the move with probability equal to @xmath103 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath2-varying moves the monte carlo scheme provides local corner flips   and two - point pivot moves  , the latter being essential to sample rings with arbitrary topology .",
    "the algorithm just described designs a markov chain on the space of ielps with fixed parameters @xmath7 and @xmath17 .",
    "several runs at different values of @xmath17 are then necessary to span a broad range of density values at fixed @xmath7 .",
    "an efficient way to get several simulations with different @xmath17 at once can be obtained by embedding the above algorithm in a sampling scheme where several markov chains at different @xmath17s run in parallel , and swaps of configurations between contiguous ( in @xmath17 ) markov chains are performed stochastically .",
    "this super markov chain is known as _ multiple markov chains _ and in the past has been proved to be very effective in increasing the sampling efficiency  @xcite .    by considering ( [ weight ] )",
    "one can determine the acceptance ratio of configurations swapping between two markov chains respectively of parameters @xmath17 and @xmath104 : since @xmath7 and @xmath23 are fixed , the only relevant term in ( [ weight ] ) is the factorial and the acceptance probability of the swap move @xmath105 reduces to @xmath106 if @xmath107 this equation can be written as @xmath108 since each term of the product is larger than @xmath97 for @xmath109 , a swap that move the longer configuration to higher values of @xmath17 is always accepted .    for multiple markov chains at different @xmath7 s ,",
