    "despite the efforts made over the last decades to clarify the functions of actual neural systems , one of the most important questions not yet addressed is to understand how neural coding naturally occurs .",
    "although the coding mechanism used by the neurons is still unclear , it is widely assumed that information coding is based on action potentials ( aps ) or _ spikes . _ in the context of spike based communication , a potential coding mechanism is that , under strong temporal constraints , neurons may perform information processing with only one spike using first - spike latency as an information carrier @xcite .",
    "first - spike latency coding has been found as a meaningful strategy because it provides a fast as well as an energy efficient environment for information processing in actual neural systems .",
    "in fact , numerous experimental works conducted in peripheral and central neurons have demonstrated that first spike latency duration carries a greater amount of information about the received stimulus features than subsequent spikes @xcite .    beside these experimental findings , theoretical and computational studies",
    "have also been performed to investigate the influence of different biophysical mechanisms shaping first - spike latency response of neurons . in this context ,",
    "pankratova et al .",
    "@xcite theoretically investigated the impact of noise  which is ubiquitous in whole nervous system  on latency dynamics of a single neuron that is subject to a suprathreshold periodic input current .",
    "they reported that for a range of periodic forcing frequency near the boundaries of suprathreshold spiking regime , there exists a resonance - like behavior of the mean latency depending on noise intensity .",
    "more precisely , as noise increases , mean response latency first dramatically increases , then reaches some maximum , and finally decreases to a value lower than the one in noise - free condition .",
    "the authors called this non - monotonic noise dependence of mean latency noise delayed decay ( ndd ) .",
    "this phenomenon indicates that latency coding is not a convenient strategy to encode signals near the spiking threshold because it implies , first , a delay in external signal detection and , second , a very low temporal spiking precision for a particular intensity of noise . in @xcite ,",
    "ndd was also investigated on the level of network , and it was reported that ndd effect on latency response can be controlled via network activity . however , these studies @xcite do not motivate , from a biophysical point of view , the source of the noise and it was incorporated artificially by adding an external additive stochastic input current",
    ". therefore , these works can not give a biophysical explanation for the emergence of ndd .",
    "recently , more realistic assumptions have been considered to characterize the noise , including ion channel noise @xcite which allows to relate intrinsic dynamics of a neuron with ndd  and synaptic background activity  that allows to relate unreliability of spike transmission with ndd @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we investigate ndd phenomenon in a more realistic scenario considering _ dynamic _ synapses .",
    "in fact , modeling synapses as static connections ( with fixed conductance ) does not reveal the possible influence of some biophysical processes on ndd .",
    "it is well - known , for instance , that synapses exhibit a high variability with a diverse origin during information transmission , such as stochastic release of neurotransmitters , variations in chemical concentration through synapses and spatial heterogeneity of synaptic response over dendrite tree @xcite .",
    "the collective effect of all these factors might result in synaptic conductance fluctuations at short time scales .",
    "it is known , e.g. , that synapses in different cortical areas can have varied forms of plasticity , being either in only a specific form , or showing a mixture of several forms @xcite .",
    "for instance , postsynaptic response can be depressed or facilitated during high presynaptic activity .",
    "synaptic depression is induced due to the fact that available neurotransmitter concentration at synaptic buttons needs some time to recover after each release event originated by arrival of presynaptic aps . if aps arrive at high frequency , the release probability of neurotransmitters for subsequent aps will decrease , and therefore postsynaptic response will be decreased or depressed .",
    "on the other hand , synaptic facilitation is a consequence of residual cytosolic calcium  that remains inside the synaptic buttons after the arrival of the first aps  which favors the release of more neurotransmitter vesicles for the next arriving ap @xcite .",
    "such increase in neurotransmitters causes a potentiation of the postsynaptic response or synaptic facilitation .",
    "short - term depression ( std ) and short - term facilitation ( stf ) mechanisms have been reported to be relevant for various brain functions , i.e. cortical gain control @xcite , information storage in neural networks @xcite , coincidence detection of signals @xcite , synchrony and selective attention @xcite , and perform new computations in diverse neural systems @xcite .",
    "our results in the present work reveal that dynamic synapses with std and stf mechanisms might give rise to emergence of rich ndd features in response latency of a single neuron .",
    "we find , e.g. , pure depressing synapses , with low levels of depression , induce a new intriguing double ndd ( dndd ) behavior which collapses into a single ndd as the level of depression increases .",
    "this is the first time it has been reported the existence of dndd behavior as a function of a biophysically realistic parameter controlling the level of activity in a neural medium .",
    "we also show that ndd effect can be attenuated or even completely eliminated from the latency response of a neuron when the level of depression is very high . on the other hand , in the presence of stf mechanism competing with std and depending on the balance between these two mechanisms , both single ndd or dndd can emerge , in such a way that synaptic",
    "facilitation favors the emergence of dndd whereas synaptic depression favors the existence of single ndd .",
    "we finally clarify the underlying mechanism that gives rise to ndd and dndd behavior in terms of the non - monotonic dependence of synaptic current fluctuations on presynaptic activity due to the presence of dynamic synapses .",
    "a schematic illustration of the system under study is depicted in fig .",
    "this consists of a postsynaptic neuron which is driven by a suprathreshold periodic stimulus and subject to an uncorrelated presynaptic activity from a finite number of excitatory and inhibitory neurons .",
    "the time evolution of membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron is modeled based on the hodgkin - huxley ( h - h ) equations as follows @xcite :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the membrane potential , @xmath3 is the membrane capacity per unit area .",
    "the constants @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are maximum conductance for sodium , potassium and leakage channels , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the corresponding sodium , potassium and leak current reversal potentials .",
    "the gating variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 that govern activation and inactivation of sodium channels and activation of potassium channels , respectively , and obey the following differential equations @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 are experimentally determined voltage dependent rate functions for the gating variable @xmath17 and can be found in @xcite . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath18 is the suprathreshold periodic current stimulus , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 stand , respectively , for the amplitude and frequency of this signal . here",
    "`` suprathreshold '' refers to an input level that produces tonic spiking activity .",
    "finally , @xmath22 represents the total synaptic current generated by @xmath23 presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory neurons where excitatory to inhibitory ratio is taken as @xmath24 , a choice that preserves the similar ratio found in the mammalian cortex @xcite .",
    "each presynaptic neuron is considered as an independent poisson spike train generator with the same presynaptic firing rate @xmath0 .",
    "synaptic connections between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons are modeled according to tsodyks and markram dynamical synapse equations @xcite .",
    "although short - term synaptic plasticity is widely considered to be valid for excitatory synapses , recent experimental studies have shown that inhibitory synapses also display this type of plasticity behavior @xcite .",
    "thus , in our study , it is reasonable to assume that tsodyks and markram equations can also be used to model inhibitory synapses , as previously considered in @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that an ap can be transmitted by a finite amount of neurotransmitter resources .",
    "that is , each presynaptic ap at a given synapse @xmath25 activates a fraction of neurotransmitters with probability @xmath26 ( release probability ) , which then quickly inactivates ( as a fast synapse ) during a characteristic time constant @xmath27 @xcite . after a recovery period @xmath28 , resources are reloaded and the synapse @xmath25 returns to its initial state .",
    "this process is governed by the following equations @xcite :    @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 + where @xmath32 are the fraction of neurotransmitters in a recovered , active and inactive state , respectively .",
    "delta functions in equations take into account that an ap arrives to the synapse at @xmath33 . the model described by eqs . @xmath34",
    "satisfactorily explains std mechanism in cortical neurons for relatively large values of @xmath35 and assuming @xmath36 , which represents a constant neurotransmitter release probability after arrival of an ap @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "stf mechanism can be introduced by assuming that @xmath26 is not fixed but is increased by a certain amount due to the influx of calcium ions through voltage sensitive ion channels into the presynaptic neuron when an ap arrives .",
    "the corresponding dynamic equation for @xmath26 is given by @xcite :    @xmath37\\delta(t - t_{spk}^{i})\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the time duration of transition from open to close state of calcium channel gates @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that large values of @xmath28 and @xmath38 are associated to stronger synaptic depression and facilitation at the synapse , respectively .",
    "more precisely , large @xmath35 implies that neurotransmitter concentration @xmath39 in ready - releasable pool takes more time to recover its maximum value after the release event induced by an ap .",
    "thus , if another ap arrives at certain posterior time @xmath40 , the amount of released neurotransmitters , that is @xmath41 , will be lower and therefore the postsynaptic response for the second ap too .",
    "this depressing effect will be stronger for larger @xmath35 and higher presynaptic firing frequency .",
    "on the other hand , large @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) implies that , assuming an initial low value of the release probability @xmath43 it will take a large time to grow until the value @xmath44 indicating that the facilitation effect ( increase of the release probability ) will take place during a large period of time . finally , for a given value of @xmath45 a large value of @xmath44 induces a strong depletion of the available resources for a given ap , and therefore a decrease of the postsynaptic response for subsequent aps , particularly at high presynaptic frequency . in the case of facilitating synapses , for a given value of @xmath46",
    "a larger value for @xmath44 produces a stronger increase in the release probability after each ap so it induces a strong and fast facilitation for high - frequency presynaptic activity . within this model ,",
    "the postsynaptic current generated at a synapse @xmath25 is taken to be proportional to the fraction of neurotransmitters in the active state , namely @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the maximum synaptic current which can be generated at the synapse only by activating all resources .",
    "based on the description of the dynamic synapse model on the level of single synapse in eqs .",
    "@xmath49 , we now can generalize the total synaptic current generated by excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic neurons as follows :    @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the relative strength between inhibitory and excitatory connections , and @xmath52 as a whole stands for maximum inhibitory synaptic current per synapse . here",
    ", we assume @xmath53 within the physiological range of balanced state of cortical neurons @xcite .",
    "to evaluate the emergence of ndd phenomenon in response latency dynamics of the postsynaptic neuron , we define latency to the first spike as the time when an ap first crosses with a positive slope a detection threshold , taken here equal to @xmath54 , relative to start of the stimulus ( see fig .",
    ", we compute mean latency of an ensemble of first spikes by averaging over @xmath55 realizations :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the appearance time of the first spike for @xmath25th realization .",
    "we also consider standard deviations of latencies , or temporal jitter , as follows :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 represents the mean squared latency .",
    "the results presented in the next sections are obtained over @xmath60 independent runs for each set of parameter values to warrant appropriate statistical accuracy with respect to the stochastic fluctuations in background activity .",
    "numerical integration of the whole system equations are performed using standard fourth order runge - kutta algorithm with a step size of @xmath61 .",
    "in this section , we have systematically analyzed the emergence of ndd in a h - h neuron which is subject to both a suprathreshold periodic signal and a noisy synaptic background activity arising from a balanced population of excitatory and inhibitory neurons . in previous works on ndd @xcite",
    ", it has been illustrated that for a given value of periodic signal amplitude @xmath20 , a h - h neuron operates in a suprathreshold regime only for a range of signal frequencies @xmath21 . in these works",
    ", it has also been demonstrated that ndd effect only emerges near the lower and upper limits of such frequency regions . as an example",
    ", we consider here the case of @xmath62 that implies a frequency range @xmath63\\ , hz$ ] for suprathreshold regime ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "to investigate ndd phenomenon , we also fix the stimulus frequency to @xmath64 which is just above the lower limit of the suprathreshold frequency region . here",
    ", it is worth noting that similar qualitative results can be obtained if one considers a signal frequency near the upper limit of considered @xmath21 region .",
    "first , we have investigated the influence of short - term synaptic depression ( varying @xmath35 ) on the emergence of ndd phenomenon by measuring latency response statistics of the postsynaptic neuron as a function of presynaptic firing rate @xmath0 , which is considered here as global control parameter to scale the intensity of background activity .",
    "since we assume that postsynaptic neuron receives inputs through purely depressing synapses , we set @xmath65 to block the facilitation mechanism in the model . in fig .",

    "this is the first time such intriguing `` double ndd '' ( dndd ) effect has been described .",

    "the resulting merged single ndd curve presents the maximum possible amplitude , as in the classical ndd behavior for static synapses , but with a very large width in @xmath0 domain compared with the static synapse case .",

    "words , since the existence of ndd implies a delay in signal detection by a given neuron , a decrease of ndd effect ( as the level of depression increases ) implies a better response of the neuron to signal detection .",

    "other parameters were as in fig .",
    "2 . , title=\"fig : \" ]      the underlying mechanism for the emergence of ndd in our system is the following .",
    "first , let us assume that a typical h - h neuron is set at its resting state in absence of a noisy synaptic input .",
    "let us consider then that it is subject to a sinusoidal signal which puts it in a spiking regime such that the neuron generates only an ap within the positive phase of the signal around its maximum amplitude ( i.e. , one ap per period of the signal ) . in the presence of a noisy synaptic input , however , this regime is conserved as far as the appearance of non - depolarizing noise fluctuations around the maximum signal amplitude impedes the generation of the ap in the current signal cycle .",
    "the last postpones the generation of ap to the subsequent signal cycles .",
    "that is , neuron can fire then around the maximum amplitude of second or third positive phase of the signal , skipping first signal cycle with enough noise .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig .",
    "the case of low presynaptic firing rate , e.g. @xmath85 , corresponds to a low noise regime at which there is not enough strong non - depolarizing fluctuations to make postsynaptic neuron to skip toward subsequent depolarizing phases .",
    "in fact , first spikes occur only in the first cycle for low @xmath0 . when presynaptic firing rate increases , for instance , to @xmath86 , synaptic noise intensity also enlarges . in this regime , firing events of neuron depict some skipping behavior from the first signal cycle .",
    "that is , for a given set of trials , neuron fires in first cycle predominantly ( blue ) , approximately same amount of times in second cycle ( red ) , and only a few times in third    . in each panel , we superimpose 50 membrane potential traces obtained from independent realizations . for each trace",
    ", membrane potential is clamped to the resting state after appearance of first spike .",
    "depending on the level of @xmath0 , first spike in response to the driving signal might occur within first ( blue ) , second ( red ) or even third signal cycle ( green ) .",
    "neurotransmitter recovery time constant was set to be @xmath76 and other synaptic parameters were as in fig .",
    "( note that vertical scaling does not refer to the amplitude of periodic signal ) ]    cycle ( green ) .",
    "this fact induces an increase in mean latency and jitter ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . finally , for @xmath87 ,",
    "skipping from the first signal cycle stops and neuron fires again within the first cycle , so mean latency and jitter start to decrease ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . however , the mechanism behind this decreasing phase of the ndd curves is different for the case of depressed ( @xmath88 ) and non - depressed ( @xmath89 ) synapses . for depressed synapses ( the case depicted in fig .",
    "6 ) and for large @xmath0 , strength of the synaptic fluctuations decreases which makes the neuron to fire again in the first signal cycle near the maximum amplitude , as in the case of very low @xmath90 for non - depressed synapses , however , for all trials neuron fires an ap at the beginning of first signal cycle due to strong fluctuations ( data not shown ) . mean latency and jitter then take small values ( see fig .",
    "2a and b ) which is lower than the noiseless case ( very low @xmath0 ) .    on the other hand , emergence of dndd behavior in the presence of both facilitation and depression can be explained with the same skipping mechanism .",
    "this can be seen , for instance , looking at the skipping behavior of firings depicted in fig . 7 for @xmath78 and @xmath91 .",
    "one can observe that first spikes only occur within the first signal cycle for very low and very large @xmath0 .",
    "however , skipping behavior is maximum ( which implies larger mean latency and jitter ) for two distinct values of @xmath0 , namely @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "in fact , for these cases there is a significant amount    .",
    "there are two values of @xmath0 ( around @xmath94 and @xmath93 ) at which the skipping to second and third signal cycles occurs frequently .",
    "these two points correspond to two maxima of the dnnd curve .",
    "synaptic parameter values were @xmath95 and @xmath76 , and other parameters were as in fig .",
    "( note that vertical scaling does not refer to the amplitude of periodic signal ) ]    of generated spikes during second and third signal cycles ( see red and green voltage traces in fig .",
    "7 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath86  which is within these two frequencies that provide maximum skipping events  the number of cycle skipped firings starts to decrease resulting in a minimum of mean latency and jitter among the two previous maxima ( see fig . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "although , we consider here facilitation induced dndd , it is worth noting that the mechanism is the same for only depression induced dndd .",
    "cycle - skipped firings and emergence of ndd in our considered system are mainly related with the behavior of total synaptic current fluctuations with @xmath0 and synapse dynamics . because of the presence of short - term plasticity mechanisms at synapses , each individual transmitted ap in a spike train evokes different postsynaptic current ( psc ) responses depending on the type of plasticity and @xmath0 . as an example in fig .",
    "8 , we illustrate such difference at a single synapse where only std mechanism is considered during synaptic transmission . at a certain level of std ( fixed value of @xmath35 ) , it is seen that the amplitude of generated pscs in response to each ap does not change very much for small @xmath0 because there is enough time between successive aps to recover neurotransmitter vesicles .",
    "however , with increase in @xmath0 , since presynaptic aps tend to appear more likely within the recovery time interval ( @xmath35 ) , vesicles could not be fully recovered for closely time - spaced successive aps .",
    "this indicates a reduction in psc amplitudes for those of aps . or alternatively , for a fixed @xmath0 , an increase in @xmath35 causes more attenuated excitatory pscs ( epsc ) or inhibitory pscs ( ipsc ) due to requirement of more time for vesicle replacement ( see fig . 8) .     at both excitatory ( red ) and inhibitory ( blue ) synapses that include std mechanism . for a fixed depression level",

    "induces attenuation of pscs . * * ]    since we assume in our study that all synapses present such dynamical behavior , the resulting total synaptic current introduced into the postsynaptic neuron will present statistical features that will depend on both @xmath35 and @xmath0 in a complex way .",
    "moreover , we are considering a balance between excitation and inhibition , and therefore , the resulting mean synaptic current @xmath96 and will not change when these parameters are varied .",
    "however , the magnitude of total synaptic current fluctuations , namely @xmath97 , exhibits a non - monotonic behavior with @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "9a for depressing synapses ( see also @xcite and @xcite for analytical approximation of such dependency ) , which is more prominent when @xmath35 increases .",
    "that is , at low @xmath0 values , there is a small number of transmitted spikes that contribute to total synaptic current .",
    "since these spikes are temporally uncorrelated ( they are poissonian distributed ) and synaptic depression is weak due to low @xmath0 ( there are not strong differences in the amplitude of the psc generated by each arriving spike ) , it is straightforward to demonstrate that @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "9a ) , which then is small .",
    "as @xmath0 increases up to a moderate value where std mechanism still has not a strong effect , @xmath97 continues rising monotonically but slowly because of the appearance of some closely time - spaced spikes in presynaptic input train which can be then depressed .",
    "after this limiting point of @xmath0 , std mechanism starts to decrease mean pscs seriously that gives rise to a decrease in @xmath97 for high @xmath0 because of increased number of closely time - spaced spikes .",

    "when @xmath89 ( static synapses ) , since @xmath97 rises monotonically with increase in @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "9a ) , it can fall within an interval @xmath100 for a particular range of @xmath0 , namely ( @xmath101 ) , that induces an increase of the mean latency and jitter based on the mechanism described above in fig . 6 . here @xmath102 is by definition the minimum current fluctuation value that can start first signal cycle skipping , and @xmath103 is the value of current fluctuations at which number of skipping events is maximum @xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 increases further within the interval @xmath104 @xmath97 also rises passing through the interval @xmath105 .",
    "here @xmath106 is the level of current fluctuations that stops skipping for large @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , within the range @xmath105 , @xmath97 starts to decrease the number of skipping events ( probability of firings during the first signal cycle tends to increase ) and creates the decay phase of ndd curve . for very large values of @xmath0 ( that implies @xmath107 ) ,",
    "background activity suppress the suprathreshold periodic signal , and consequently mean latency gets lower values than the deterministic case because the response time is mostly determined by large synaptic current fluctuations at each trial .    on the other hand ,",
    "as std mechanism takes place at synapses , the optimal amount of synaptic current fluctuations for cycle - skipped firings can be achieved for a wide range of @xmath0 and @xmath35 due to non - monotonic behavior of @xmath97 with @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , as @xmath0 increases , @xmath97 first exceeds the @xmath102 triggering cycle - skipped firings and initiating the rising phase of the ndd .",
    "then , it starts to decrease after reaching some maximum , which is determined by the level of depression @xmath35 and that induces the maximum level of ndd curve .",
    "finally , it crosses again @xmath102 from above which stops cycle - skipped firings and creates the decay phase of the ndd curve .",
    "therefore , it can be said that appearance of ndd with depressing synapses depends on @xmath0 range that provides the condition of @xmath108 . as seen in fig .",
    "9a , since @xmath0 range providing this condition starts to shrink with increase in @xmath35 , the width and maximum of ndd curves decrease for more depressed synapses indicating tendency to disappearance of ndd effect ( see fig .",
    "2a and b ) .",
    "the previous scenario described for depressing synapses occurs for values of @xmath35 such that maximum of current fluctuations is smaller than @xmath109 that happens for @xmath110 and induces single ndd curves . for values of @xmath111 as we have already mentioned in section iii .",
    "a , a dndd effect emerges .",
    "this can be explained due to the fact that maximum of @xmath97 ( in the @xmath0 domain ) is larger than @xmath112 for such levels of depression ( see fig .",
    "this happens since non - monotonic behavior of @xmath97 occurs for very large values of @xmath0 in such a way that @xmath97 still grows as a function of @xmath0 , for the range of frequencies at which ndd appears , and may exceed @xmath112 .",
    "then , since @xmath112 corresponds to the strength of the current fluctuations at which maximum skipping behavior occurs , a larger value of @xmath97 starts to stop skipping events , which creates the first ndd curve .",
    "this takes place until @xmath97 reaches its maximum .",
    "when @xmath97 decreases from its maximum ( for larger @xmath0 ) , skipping events start to increase again until @xmath97 becomes smaller than @xmath113 further increase in @xmath0 provides @xmath97 to be less than @xmath112 that creates the second ndd curve due to reduced number of skipping events .",
    "the overall behavior of mean latency and jitter follow thus a dndd curve as a function of @xmath0 ( see fig . 2c and d ) .",
    "emergence of dndd behavior can be also easily understood in terms of the complex dependence of @xmath97 with @xmath0 , @xmath35 and @xmath42 when stf is present at synapses competing with std ( see fig .",
    "such dependency profile can also be found in @xcite and @xcite where the behavior of @xmath97 qualitatively matches with our fig .",
    "in fact for the present situation , @xmath97 can be significantly larger than @xmath112 ( due to facilitation ) for some range of intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "this increase of @xmath97 is due the the fact that stf cancels std mechanism for such @xmath0 values ",
    "so @xmath97 can be as large as in the case of static synapses  and has no effect at higher values of @xmath0 , so @xmath97 decreases due to std mechanism .",
    "in other words , the rising phase of @xmath97 , when facilitation is considered , is mainly determined by stf mechanism . however , the decreasing phase after a certain @xmath0 is due to std mechanism .",
    "the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath97 with @xmath0 makes it to cross the value @xmath112 two times , one with positive and the other with negative slope , both corresponding then to maxima in mean latency and jitter .",
    "the minimum between these two maxima  which defines the dndd curve  appears where @xmath97 reaches its largest value above @xmath112 since at this value the number of cycle skipping events is smallest within the frequency range among the two maxima of the dndd curve . as larger is the distance above @xmath112 to the maximum of @xmath97 ( e.g increasing @xmath42 ) , a more deep minimum can be obtained for the dndd curve ( compare fig . 3 and fig .",
    "9b ) . moreover , for very large @xmath42 and a given value of @xmath35 , this minimum of dndd saturates and can not be more deep as shown in fig .",
    "3 because the maximum of @xmath97 also saturates for large @xmath42 .      as a final result of our study , we here present an interesting low - frequency behavior of mean latency and jitter when depressing synapses are present . as can be observed by comparing the latency statistics and @xmath97 values , respectively , in fig . 2 and fig . 9a ,",
    "although there is no significant variation in @xmath97 for different levels of synaptic depression at low @xmath0 , mean latency and jitter get different values .",
    "note that this effect does not emerge when facilitation is present at synapses ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . to illustrate this fact , we compute the probability distribution of first spike latencies for three different values of @xmath35 that generate almost equal strengths of @xmath97 at @xmath85 , a value at which difference in latency statistics is more obvious . as seen in fig",
    ". 10 , although amplitudes of synaptic current fluctuations @xmath97 are almost same for different levels of depression , first spike latency probability distributions are quite different .",
    "for instance , for the lowest level of synaptic depression considered here , latency probability distribution has a pronounced second peak around the time for the depolarization phase of second signal cycle ( see inset ) .",
    "notably , such a multimodal behavior of h - h model for low noise regime was also reported in @xcite .",
    "this second peak at low @xmath0 indicates that a small increase in @xmath97 significantly increases the probability for skipping from first cycle of the stimulus . a higher probability of skipping results in an increased values of corresponding mean latency and jitter for low @xmath35 with respect to other considered synaptic depression levels ( where this second peak in probability distribution is less pronounced or even absent ) .",
    "and @xmath114 ) when the presynaptic firing rate was set to @xmath115 although amplitudes of synaptic current fluctuations @xmath97 are almost same , probability distributions of first spike occurrence time is quite different .",
    "inset shows enlargement of the second peak that is not clear in the main plot .",
    "other synaptic parameters were as in fig .",
    "in this work , we have studied first spike latency response of a h - h neuron that receives , in addition to a suprathreshold signal , a noisy current from a finite number of afferents through dynamic synapses .",
    "the noisy input current is originated from arrival of uncorrelated spikes trains in each afferent that follow a poissonian statistics with mean firing frequency @xmath0 . to characterize ndd phenomenon ,",
    "we have computed mean latency response and its jitter as a function of this presynaptic firing rate @xmath0 .",
    "this constitutes a more realistic scenario than traditional studies , since @xmath0 provides a suitable biophysically realistic parameter to control the level of activity in actual neural systems .",
    "our work reveals that when synapses do not present activity dependent synaptic mechanisms , such as std nor stf , classical ndd behavior is found as a function of @xmath116 which in this case ( static synapses ) is a biologically meaningful measure of noise level .",
    "however , when dynamic synapses with std and stf are included in description of synapses , we found a very different behavior of response latency as a function of @xmath90 this is due to the non - monotonic dependency of current fluctuations on @xmath0 and how it is modulated by the dynamic synapse parameters ( i.e. , @xmath35 , @xmath42 and @xmath82 ) .",
    "for instance , for the case of pure depressing synapses , we found two different behaviors : a new intriguing dndd behavior occurs for low levels of std .",
    "this disappears as std level increases and single ndd emerges .",
    "in addition , we found that when std level increases even more in this last case , ndd effect starts to disappear .",
    "this provides possible use of large std levels as a mechanism to improve first spike latency coding .",
    "however , for intermediate values of @xmath35 ( @xmath117 ) , latency coding efficiency may be poor because one has large amplitude and width in the frequency domain of the resulting single ndd curves . on the other hand , in the presence of stf competing with std , single ndd or dndd can emerge depending on the balance between these two synaptic mechanisms , in such a way that stf favors the emergence of dndd whereas std favors the existence of single ndd . we have also demonstrated the importance of release probability at rest @xmath82 on ndd . when only std mechanism is present at synapses , it is shown that ndd is not emerging for very low values of @xmath82 , however both ndd and dndd can emerge as it is increased . on the other hand , in the case of stf mechanism , ndd exists in response latency of the neuron regardless of @xmath82 and it can be transformed to dndd as @xmath82 increases .",
    "such effects of @xmath82 are also originated from its influence on shaping total synaptic current fluctuations as @xmath0 varies .",
    "an interesting point not considered in the present work concerns the behavior of ndd in the case of unbalanced synaptic background activity .",
    "note that in our study , the scaling factor @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) determines the competition between excitation and inhibition .",
    "variation of this variable would provide either an excitation or an inhibition dominated synaptic background activity .",
    "for instance , for @xmath118 , presynaptic excitatory neurons would dominate the overall synaptic background activity resulting in a positive mean synaptic current .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath119 , the sign of the mean synaptic current would be negative due to the large inhibition .",
    "for a given set of dynamic synapse model parameters , mean synaptic current for these two unbalanced situations quickly saturates to a positive ( for excitation dominated ) or negative ( for inhibitory dominated ) value in @xmath0 domain ( more or less it is a dc current ) due to the nature of dynamic synapses @xcite .",
    "when @xmath118 , injection of a such depolarizing positive bias current would provide a strong stable spiking regime to the postsynaptic neuron in which influence of synaptic current fluctuations on spike timing is negligible .",
    "therefore , we expect that ndd effect would be reduced significantly or completely removed from latency response of the postsynaptic neuron . on the other hand , in the case of inhibitory dominated background activity , a negative hyper - polarizing mean synaptic current would cause a non - spiking regime for the postsynaptic neuron because suprathreshold driving periodic signal is already very close to the subthreshold boundary . in such a non - spiking regime where the neuron exhibits subthreshold oscillations near its resting potential , occurrence of aps would be determined randomly by fluctuations of synaptic current .",
    "therefore , one can not mention about the ndd phenomenon in inhibitory dominated synaptic input regime due to definition of this phenomenon ( resonance like dependency on noise ) .",
    "the present study reports for the first time the emergence of dndd behavior as a function of a biophysically realistic parameter controlling the level of activity in a neural medium .",
    "dndd behavior can be useful for first spike latency coding when one is interested to encode the stimulus within a particular range of noise in the system .",
    "in fact , a minimum of mean latency among the two maxima might provide a suitable range of intermediate working frequencies at which the mean latency is near to the deterministic case .",
    "the similar behavior for the jitter as a function of @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , fig",
    ". 3 and 4 ) indicates an increase in spike precision that might be useful for some specific information tasks requiring spike time reliability .    finally , we would like to note that the results presented in this work were obtained by considering first , a balance between presynaptic excitation and inhibition resulting in a zero mean fluctuating total synaptic current and , second , a critical driving suprathreshold signal frequency range providing the postsynaptic neuron to operate closely to its spiking threshold . under these conditions , due to",
    "the mechanism explained in section iii .",
    "b , we expect that any biological process having capacity to modulate @xmath97 non - monotonically between @xmath102 and @xmath106 might give rise to similar ndd and dndd effects on response latency of a postsynaptic neuron . in this context , a possible extension of our study could be investigating the influence of astrocytic gliotransmission on the emergence and behavior of ndd , since it has been shown that activation of presynaptic receptors by chemicals released by surrounding glia can regulate the mechanism of short term plasticity in an activity dependent manner ( see @xcite ) .",
