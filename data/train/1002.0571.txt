    "in this article we study exit times of continuous - time random walks ( ctrws ) with drift . by this",
    "we understand a random process @xmath0 whose evolution in time can be thought of as the result of the combined effect of a constant drift and the occurrence of random jumps .",
    "thus , for @xmath1 we define @xmath2 where @xmath3 for @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the jump times , @xmath6 the jump magnitude and @xmath7 by convention .",
    "note that as the notation suggests , @xmath8 coincides with a jump .",
    "the process @xmath0 may represent physically the position of a diffusing particle , for instance .",
    "all through this paper we will assume that ( i ) the sojourn times @xmath9 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables with probability density and cumulative distribution function ( pdf and , respectively , cdf ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; ( ii ) @xmath12 is a sequence of i.i.d . random variables with common pdf @xmath13 ; and ( iii ) , that @xmath14 is independent of @xmath15 for any @xmath16 .",
    "in absence of drift , and when the holding times @xmath17 are exponentially distributed , @xmath18 for some @xmath19 , the jump process @xmath20 is a classical compound poisson process ( cpp ) characterized by having independent increments @xmath21 ; in addition the associated `` arrival - process '' @xmath22 is poisson distributed : @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , drift - less ctrws can be considered as a generalization of cpps where the holding times of the processes @xmath20 are arbitrarily distributed . in statistical physics",
    "such drift - less ctrws have been widely used after the work of montroll @xmath24 weiss @xcite and their relevant statistical properties , like correlation functions and the behavior in the continuum limit ,   a subject of intense interest @xcite .",
    "applications of ctrws can be found in the study of transport in disordered media ( e.g. , @xcite ) , anomalous relaxation in polymer chains  @xcite , sandpile and earthquake modeling ( e.g. , @xcite ) , random networks @xcite , self - organized criticality in granular systems  @xcite , scaling properties of lvy walks  @xcite , electron tunneling  @xcite , transmission tomography  @xcite , distribution of matter in the universe  @xcite and changes in stock markets due to unexpected catastrophes  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the use of ctrws has been advocated to give a microscopic , tick - by - tick , description of financial markets : see  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of ctrw applications in finance and economics is given in @xcite .",
    "physically , the introduction of these general ctrws stems from the fact that in many settings the exponential holding - time assumption may be inadequate to describe the physical situation |see @xcite .",
    "additional motivation arises from the observation that there is an extensive number of different physical systems that show some sort of anomalous diffusion    in the last years| , and that this anomalous behavior can well described by fractional fokker - planck equations obtained after imposing the continuum limit on ctrw models  @xcite .",
    "the further addition of the drift term to a ctrw , as we do in eq .",
    "( [ process ] ) , is a natural and significant incorporation .",
    "the resulting process |which can be viewed as the discrete analogue of a ( fractional ) diffusion with drift| is known for playing a fundamental role in the modeling of the cash flow at an insurance company @xcite and , more recently , it has been shown that it also rules the rate of energy dissipation in nonlinear optical fibers  @xcite . indeed",
    ", present and forthcoming results can be also of interest in transport in amorphous media  @xcite , models of decision and response time in psychology  @xcite and neuron dynamics  @xcite .    in all these scenarios one",
    "is faced with the basic problem of determining the first - passage time for a ctrw with drift , a question that has been theoretically considered in the past  @xcite . the usual approach",
    "taken there entails the computation of transition and first - passage time distributions of the process , e.g. @xcite , and the results are typically obtained under the assumption of the continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "this procedure has incontestable advantages for obtaining the leading - order behavior , but it is not adequate for a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the process at the inter - jump timescale , as in  @xcite .    motivated by the above , here",
    "we pose the problem of evaluating the mean exit time from the interval @xmath25 of a drifting ctrw @xmath0 when _ the only available information is the present state _",
    "@xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the present chronological time |note that , by adjusting the time clock and spatial scale , the results carry over to any interval @xmath28 and initial time @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath0 is given by eq .",
    "( [ process ] ) where @xmath20 is the jump part and @xmath29 the associated counting process ( a renewal process ) .",
    "in the drift - less case previous work in this regard includes that of @xcite where a linear integral equation for the mean escape time after a jump off a given interval is derived .",
    "we note however that these results do not cover a generic situation .",
    "indeed , while for cpps ( as for the general lvy processes ) markov property implies that results derived starting at a jump time carry over to arbitrary present , no such inference is possible for a generic ctrw due to its non - markovian nature . thus , escape times _ depend on the actual state and available information and hence the question as to how to generalize the former results to _ general present time @xmath30 appears naturally .",
    "we remark that implications ensuing from the lack of markovianess have been ignored at large in the literature , a gap that we have intended to fill in |see @xcite .",
    "in particular , it remains an open question to what extent dropping the assumption that `` the present is a jump time '' affects the relevant probabilities .",
    "here we address these issues and generalize the results of @xcite in a twofold way by assuming that ( i ) a drift @xmath31 operates on the system and ( ii ) the present @xmath30 is an arbitrary time , not necessarily a jump instant , and the observer _ has knowledge of the present , but not of the history , of the system .",
    "_ _ _    the interest of this problem goes far beyond the purely academic since such a situation may appear in several different physical contexts .",
    "for example , one might be interested in predicting the mean time for an insurance / financial company to go bankrupt from the knowledge of just the actual company budget , i.e. , when the information regarding the company s past performance has not been disclosed .",
    "a second example is provided by the study of the distribution of inhomogeneities in an optical fiber ; it was found @xcite that the signal s energy amplitude at a point @xmath32 ( @xmath32 is the spatial variable in this setting ) involves a ctrw with drift @xmath0 ; in this context   represents the _ the space variable _ may occur in different physical systems , with @xmath33 standing for some physical observable of interest , like the energy . in this connection , @xmath30 might represent the location of a detector , or a sensitive part of the appliance at which measures are taken .",
    "] one typically knows only the value of the energy at the observation point @xmath30 , not on the whole fiber .",
    "more generally the approach will be relevant in situations where either the elapsed time between events is `` large '' ( it might be as large as years , in a context of catastrophes observation ) or when the event s times @xmath34 are not physically measurable observables and only mean escape times are .",
    "( note that both the mean exit time and initial time are typically _ macroscopic _ magnitudes . )",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section  [ s2 ]",
    "we show how the solution to these problems involves ideas drawn from renewal theory and solve the simpler case when @xmath35 . the case @xmath7 is considered in the next sections where it is found that key properties of the obtained equation depend on the sign of the jumps . in section  [ s_up ] it is shown that if this sign is positive the solution can be given in closed form by laplace transformation |cf .",
    "( [ ff_sol ] ) and  ( [ hattime ] ) .",
    "for the case when drift and jumps have opposite signs we find integral equations that the relevant objects satisfy , see section  [ s_down ] , but no closed solution can be given in a general situation .",
    "section  [ s_two - sided ] addresses the most general scenario in which jumps @xmath6 can take both signs .",
    "solvable cases are discussed there .    in all cases",
    "we exemplify our results by considering the particular instance when sojourn times have erlang distribution , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 corresponds to having a sum of @xmath38 independent exponential variables and hence generalizes the exponential density in a natural way , @xmath39 while it maintains an adequate capability to fit measured data . from a physical perspective",
    "these facts make this density a natural candidate to describe multi - component systems which operate only when several independent , exponentially distributed operations have been completed or whenever there is a hidden poissonian flux of information and jumps only appear as the outcome of two or more consecutive arrivals .",
    "this explains the interest that it has drawn in the field of information traffic @xcite .",
    "similarly the appearance of this distribution to model transaction orders in financial markets can also be expected since it takes , at least , two arrivals ( buy and sell orders ) for a transaction to be completed .",
    "for further applications to ruin problems and insurance see @xcite .",
    "recall that we aim to study exit times of a drifting ctrw @xmath0 given the present state @xmath40 . to this end",
    "let @xmath41 be the first time past @xmath30 at which @xmath0 exits @xmath25 ;",

    "also that here and elsewhere we use @xmath46 $ ] to denote expectation .    in the exponential markov case",
    "@xmath47 is independent of @xmath30 , @xmath48 and it _ only remains to formulate ( and solve ) the equation that this object satisfies .",
    "however this situation no longer holds in the generic , non - markovian case where @xmath47 does depend on @xmath30 .",
    "we find ( see below and section  [ s_up ] ) that the relation between @xmath42 and @xmath49 involves the `` excess life '' @xmath50 , or time elapsed until the next arrival occurs .",

    "indeed let @xmath66 , say , be the `` last '' jump time and @xmath67 the time elapsed from @xmath34 to the present . then",
    ", with @xmath68 one obviously has that @xmath69 , and that the exit time right after @xmath34 is that after @xmath30 , @xmath70 , plus @xmath71 , and hence @xmath72 + { \\mathbb{e}}[\\mathbf{t}_b^{x , r}]={\\mathbb{e}}[\\tau_{n+1}]-{\\mathbb{e}}[e_r^+]+ t_{b}(x , r).\\label{v=0}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath73 follows adding a correction term to @xmath49 which depends only on @xmath30 . finally @xmath49 is obtained by solving a linear integral equation |see @xcite .",
    "unfortunately when @xmath74 this simple argument fails as then _ knowledge of the present position does not entail its knowledge at @xmath34 . in the next sections we derive the relevant correction to the mean exit time .",
    "this correction depends now in all parameters @xmath30 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 |see eqs .",
    "( [ tb_up ] ) and  ( [ tb_down ] ) below . _",
    "in this section we consider the case when both drift and jumps have a positive sign , i.e. when @xmath0 is increasing . as a result",
    ", the process can only leave the interval through the upper boundary @xmath76 .",
    "let us assume that at time @xmath77 the system is in @xmath78 , and that the excess life @xmath52 is known in advance , @xmath79 .",
    "if the excess life is longer than @xmath80 , the drift will drive the process out of the region at time @xmath81 , before the next jump takes place at @xmath82 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath83 at least a jump of size @xmath84 will occur prior to exiting the interval .",
    "note that just before @xmath82 the process @xmath0 is no longer at @xmath75 , but at @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , two possible scenarios appear : either the jump size is larger than the remaining distance up to the upper boundary , @xmath86 , and the process leaves the interval at @xmath87 , or it does not . in the latter case the problem renews from @xmath88 , @xmath89 , so the mean escape time will be increased by an amount @xmath90 .",

    "the major benefit of the continuum assumption is that it allows to obtain general results on the basis of limited knowledge of the jumping time and size pdfs , even when these distributions do not have all their moments well defined .",
