    "in recent years , models with extra dimensions are often used to obtain unified theories beyond the standard model @xcite . in this brane - world scenario , we need to construct a soliton whose world volume effective theory resembles the standard model .",
    "these solitons are usually some kind of topological defects of our higher dimensional theory .",
    "the simplest soliton is the domain wall with co - dimension one , and the next simplest is the vortex with co - dimension two , whereas the co - dimension three ( four ) soliton is called monopole ( instanton ) .",
    "it has also been customary to consider supersymmetric ( susy ) theories in order to build realistic unified models @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric theories often help to obtain stable solitons as bps states , which preserve part of supersymetry of the origonal theory @xcite .",
    "it has been known that these bps solitons automatically solve the field equations and their stability is usually guaranteed by topological charges . moreover ,",
    "these bps solitons have been extremely useful to understand the nonperturbative dynamics of supersymmetric theories .    in order to obtain low - energy effective theory on the world volume of the soliton ,",

    "the minimal number of susy in these dimensions is eight .",
    "we can easily obtain theories in lower dimensions by making a simple or scherk - schwarz dimensional reduction .",
    "let us first discuss domain walls . to obtain domain walls , we need to have two or more discrete vacua .",
    "it is only achieved by using massive hypermultiplets , which requires five or lower dimensions .",

    "the @xmath0 gauge transformations @xmath54 act on the matrix function @xmath48 as @xmath55 thus we define a gauge invariant quantity @xmath56 from @xmath48 as @xmath57 the moduli matrix @xmath53 is also gauge invariant . the bps equations ( [ bpseq - sigma ] ) for vector multiplets can be rewritten in the following gauge invariant form @xmath58 where the source term is given in terms of the moduli matrix @xmath53 as @xmath59 we call eq.([eq : master - eq - wall ] ) as the master equation for domain walls .",
    "we should solve the master equation for a given moduli matrix @xmath53 .",
    "it has been conjectured that the solution of the master equation always exists and is unique , for any given moduli matrix @xmath53 @xcite , @xcite . if this is true , the moduli matrix @xmath53 is the necessary and sufficient data for the moduli of the solution .",
    "this conjecture has been proved for @xmath13 gauge thoeries recently @xcite . for non - abelian gauge theories such as @xmath0 , the best evidence for the moduli matrix to be the necessary and sufficient data for the moduli , is given by the index theorem @xcite : the number of independent parameters contained in the moduli matrix agrees precisely with that required by the index theorem .",
    "additional evidence is provided by the exact solutions at strong gauge coupling limit and at discrete finite coupling@xcite , where the solution of master equation indeed exists for a restricted class of moduli matrices @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the differential equation ( [ def - s ] ) defines the matrix function @xmath46 only up @xmath60 arbitrary complex integration constants .",
    "therefore a set @xmath61 of the matrix function @xmath48 and the moduli matrix @xmath53 and another set @xmath62 give the same physical fields @xmath63 , provided they are related by @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "we call this symmetry as ` world - volume symmetry ' .",
    "this equivalence relation @xmath66 defines an equivalence class of moduli matrices , which is the genuinely independent moduli .",
    "namely the moduli space for ( multi-)wall solutions ( including all possible boundary conditions ) denoted by @xmath67 is topologically isomorphic to the complex grassmann manifold : @xmath68 whose complex dimension is given by @xmath69 .",
    "this is a _ compact _ ( closed ) set . on the other hand ,",
    "one expects noncompact moduli parameters , such as positions of walls .",
    "the presence of noncompact moduli parameters and the compactness of the total moduli space can be consistently understood , if we note that the moduli space @xmath67 includes all topological sectors determined by different boundary conditions .",
    "suppose we have a three wall configuration connecting the vacuum a at left infinity to the vacuum c at right infinity through the next to right vacuum b. if we let the right - most wall to the right infinity , we eventually obtain a two wall configuration connecting the vacuum a to the vacuum b. in this way , we can obtain two wall toplogical sectors as boundaries of a three wall topological sector . from the above illusrative example",
    ", we can observe that the grassmann manifold as the total moduli space can be decomposed into various topological sectors @xmath70 for @xmath71 bps walls @xmath72@xmath73 one should note that the total moduli space also includes the vacuum states with no walls @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 which correspond to @xmath77 points @xmath78 .",
    "these vacua are the only points where all susy are preserved @xmath79",
    ". we can decompose in more detail according to topological sectors with specific boundary conditions @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the moduli subspace of bps ( multi-)wall solutions for the topological sector of @xmath82 @xmath83 , and the sum is taken over the bps sectors .",
    "although each sector ( except for vacuum states ) is in general an open set containing noncompact moduli , the total space is compact .      in order to obtain the low - energy effective field theory , we need to promote the moduli parameters to fields @xmath84 on the world - volume of walls @xcite .",
    "it is again useful to use the solution ( [ sol - h ] ) of the hypermultiplet bps equation ( [ bpseq - h1 ] ) in terms of the matrix function @xmath48 . by using the solution of the hypermultiplet bps equation",
    ", we can rewrite the lagrangian in terms of the gauge invariant matrix @xmath56 . by systematically expanding the lagrangian in powers of the slow - movement parameter @xmath85",
    ", we can retain up to two powers of @xmath85 .",
    "we find the resulting effective lagrangian as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the tension of the bps ( multi-)wall in eq.([eq : tension ] ) , and @xmath88 is the khler potential of moduli fields @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xmath91 \\big|_{\\omega = \\omega _ { \\rm sol}.   } \\label{eq : kahler - pot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we should replace the @xmath56 in ( [ eq : kahler - pot ] ) by the solution @xmath92 of the master equation ( [ eq : master - eq - wall ] ) .    it is interesting to observe that this khler potential serves as an action from which one can derive the master equation ( [ eq : master - eq - wall ] ) by the usual minimal action principle .",
    "this fact can be explained if we use the superfield formulation for preserved four susy . by expanding the fundamental lagrangian in powers of the slow - movement parameter @xmath85",
    ", we find that the second hypermultiplet superfield @xmath93 and vector superfield @xmath94 become lagrange multipliers .",
    "one can use the constraint equation resulting from integrating @xmath93 to obtain a lagrangian in five dimensions amounting the lagrangian for the remaining degree of freedom expressed in terms of the superfield @xmath56 .",
    "this is precisely the density of the khler potential in eq.([eq : kahler - pot ] ) before integrating over @xmath95 .      in the strong gauge coupling limit @xmath96 ,",
    "the master equation can be algebraically solved @xmath97 with this solution , we can obtain @xmath48 by fixing a gauge .",
    "then all the other fields such as @xmath98 and @xmath99 can also be obtained .",
    "there are two dimensionful parameters in the system : mass difference @xmath100 of hypermultiplets , and the gauge coupling times the square root of the fayet - iliopoulos parameter @xmath101 .",
    "the strong coupling limit actually implies the limit @xmath102 .",
    "this exact solution of master equation at @xmath103 corresponds to the gauge theory becoming a nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm ) whose target space is the cotangent bundle over the grassmann manifold @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "since the grassmann manifold is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath32 and @xmath105 with fixed @xmath34 , all the result are also symmetric under the exchange ( actually the sign of the fayet - iliopoulos parameter should be changed ) .",
    "we call this as a duality .",
    "domain walls in this model can be realized as kinky d@xmath106-brane connecting separated d(@xmath107)-branes in the type iia / iib string theory @xcite .",
    "dynamics of domain walls can be understood very easily by this brane configuration .",
    "we have also studied slightly different model where several new features of walls are realized .",
    "this is a @xmath4 gauge theory with 4 hypermultiplets @xmath108 with unequal charges @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 charges for these 4 hypermultiplets are given by @xmath109 in the strong coupling limit @xmath96 , two @xmath13 vector multiplets produces two constraints , and gives a nlsm . in order to study the constraints and the bps flows for the multi - wall configurations , we define the following quantity as bilinears of scalar fields of the @xmath23-th hypermultiplet @xmath110 the conditions for susy vacua are given by @xmath111 @xmath112    by studying the second constraint ( [ eq : vacuum - cod2 ] )",
    ", we find that it is not allowed to have nonvanishing values of both @xmath113 ( the first hypermultiplet ) and @xmath114 ( the second hypermultiplet ) for each flavor .",
    "this implies that the bps flows occur only in a submanifold with half of the total dimensions .",
    "we find that this moduli space of the bps flows is precisely a special lagrangian submanifold of the target space of the nlsm .",
    "we find that there are several special lagrangian submanifolds for this target space of the nlsm .",
    "the total moduli space is obtained as the union of all these special lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "because of two constraints from two @xmath13 gauge groups , we only need to use two out of four @xmath115 to describe the bps flows . since the bps flows stop only at vacua , the first vacuum conditions ( [ eq : vacuum - cod1 ] ) constitute boundaries of the bps flows",
    ". then the bps flows for multi - wall configurations are restricted to closed polygons in the @xmath116 plane .",

    "we have explicitly illustrated this movement in fig.[exchange1 ] and [ exchange2 ] .",
    "[ exchange1 ] ]     case .",
    "[ exchange2 ] ]    we have also observed that the moduli space dimension can be larger than naively suggested by index theorem for walls connecting a particular set of vacua , for instance two vacua on @xmath122 in the case i.",
    "so far we have been considering walls which can appear in the higgs phase of susy gauge theories .",
    "we can have solitons with more codimensions , such as vortices , monopoles , and instantons . if @xmath13 gauge group is unbroken , magnetic flux from a monopole can spread radially . however , if it is placed in the higgs phase where there is no unbroken subgroups , magnetic flux has to be squeezed into a flux tube because of the meissner effect , as illustrated in fig.[fig : mihp ] .",
    "this composite soliton of monopoles and vortices has been found recently @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore a monopole in the higgs phase has to accompany vortices .",
    "although both monopoles and vortices are @xmath123 bps solitons , they preserve different halves of susy . we find that they preserve only a quarter of susy , and that walls are also allowed at the same time as composite soliton preserving @xmath3 of susy @xcite .",
    "we assume that the configuration depends on @xmath124 ( co - dimension three ) , and the poincar invariance in @xmath125 . by requring a @xmath3 susy to be conserved",

    "<S> recent results on bps solitons in the higgs phase of supersymmetric ( susy ) gauge theories with eight supercharges are reviewed . for @xmath0 gauge theories with the @xmath1 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation , </S>",
    "<S> the total moduli space of walls are found to be the complex grassmann manifold @xmath2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the monopole in the higgs phase has to accompany vortices , and preserves a @xmath3 of susy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that walls are also allowed to coexist with them . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain all the solutions of such @xmath3 bps composite solitons in the strong coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> instantons in the higgs phase is also obtained as 1/4 bps states . as another instructive example , we take @xmath4 gauge theories with four hypermultiplets . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the moduli space is the union of several special lagrangian submanifolds of the higgs branch vacua of the corresponding massless theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe transmutation of walls and repulsion and attraction of bps walls . </S>",
    "<S> this is a review of recent works on the subject , which was given at the conference by n.  sakai .     </S>",
