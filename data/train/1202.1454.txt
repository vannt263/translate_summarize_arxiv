    "cosmology and astrophysics provide several convincing * evidences of the existence of dark matter * ( dm ) . the observation that some mass is missing to explain the internal dynamics of galaxy clusters and the rotations of galaxies dates back respectively to the 30s and the 70s . the observations from weak lensing , for instance in the spectacular case of the so - called ` bullet cluster ' , provide evidence that there is mass where",
    "nothing is optically seen .",
    "more generally , global fits to a number of cosmological datasets ( cosmic microwave background , large scale structure and also type ia supernovae ) allow to determine very precisely the amount of dm in the global energy - matter content of the universe at @xmath0  @xcite is defined as usual as the energy density in dark matter with respect to the critical energy density of the universe @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the present hubble parameter .",
    "@xmath3 is its reduced value @xmath4 . ] .",
    "all these signals pertain to the gravitational effects of dark matter at the cosmological and extragalactical scale .",
    "searches for explicit manifestation of the dm particles that are supposed to constitute the halo of our own galaxy ( and the large scale structures beyond it ) have instead so far been giving negative results , but this might be on the point of changing .    * indirect searches * for dark matter aim at detecting the signatures of the annihilations or decays of dm particles in the fluxes of cosmic rays ( crs ) , intended in a broad sense : charged particles ( electrons and positrons , protons and antiprotons , deuterium and antideuterium ) , photons ( gamma rays , x - rays , synchrotron radiation ) , neutrinos .",
    "in general , a key point of all these searches is to look for channels and ranges of energy where it is possible to beat the background from ordinary astrophysical processes .",
    "this is for instance the basic reason why searches for charged particles focus on fluxes of antiparticles ( positrons , antiprotons , antideuterons ) , much less abundant in the universe than the corresponding particles , and searches for photons or neutrinos have to look at areas where the dm - signal to astro - noise ratio can be maximized .",
    "pioneering works have explored indirect detection ( i d ) as a promising avenue of discovery since the late-70 s . since then , innumerable papers have explored the predicted signatures of countless particle physics dm models . in the past 3 years or so , however , the field has experienced a significant burst of activity , mainly due to the results presented by a few very well performing experiments , above all the pamela satellite , the fermi satellite and the hess telescope .",
    "it is fair to say that the field has passed , for better or for worse , from a theory - driven state to a data - driven phase .",
    "the * scope of this work * is to schematically present the _ status _ of the field of indirect dm detection  , with a specific attention to the experimental results and their phenomenological interpretation in terms of dark matter ( in sec .",
    "[ status ] ) and with some attention to future expectations .",
    "what this write - up does not intend to be is a technical review of the methods and formul  employed for dm i d ( which can instead be found to a large extent in  @xcite ) : indeed , there is hardly any equation in this work",
    ". it also does _ not _ intend to be a proper , comprehensive backward - looking review of the activity mentioned above .",
    "nevertheless , an attempt to isolate the main theory directions which have emerged , and the bits which are likely to stay with us , is made in sec .",
    "[ theory ] . in sec .",
    "[ uncertainties ] i list the main uncertainties that affect the interpretation of astrophysical signals in terms of dark matter : this is an important area for the dm practitioners to follow , because major advancements in the field of indirect detection will probably pass through related advancements there . before moving to the subject matter , let us quickly remind ourselves of the framework inside which most of the activity develops : the one centered around wimps .",
    "a well spread theoretical prejudice wants the dm particles to be * thermal relics * from the early universe .",
    "they were as abundant as photons in the beginning , being freely created and destructed in pairs when the temperature of the hot plasma was larger then their mass .",
    "their relative number density started then being suppressed as annihilations proceeded but the temperature dropped below their mass , due to the cooling of the universe .",
    "finally the annihilation processes also froze out as the universe expanded further .",
    "the remaining , diluted abundance of stable particles constitutes the dm today . as it turns out",
    ", particles with weak scale mass ( @xmath5 ) and weak interactions could play the above story remarkably well , and their final abundance would automatically ( miracolously ? ) be the observed @xmath6 . while this is certainly not the only possibility , the mechanism is appealing enough that a several - gev - to - some - tev scale dm particle with weak interactions ( * wimp * ) is often considered as the most likely dm candidate .",
    "* variations * of this paradigm are of course possible , and have actually started to gain strength in recent years , as the experimental program to search for wimps reaches culmination .",
    "a close relative of the wimp paradigm is the class of so - called wimpless models , in which the thermal freeze - out story still is at play but the role of weak interactions is filled by some other kind of interaction .",
    "indeed , very close to this class fall all the models postulating ` dark forces ' , ` secluded dm ' and the like , which will be briefly addressed in sec .  [ theory ] .",
    "the somewhat opposite routes , instead , are to assume a different cosmological history  @xcite , or to consider very feebly interacting particles which would have never reached thermal equilibrium @xcite , or to postulate that dm originates from the decay of some other species , the latter maybe being itself a wimp  @xcite .",
    "finally , a recently - popular - again suggestion is that dm is produced with a primordial asymmetry between particles and antiparticles , similarly to baryons , and that only one of the two species ( say , particles , for definiteness ) survives , exactly like for baryons  @xcite . in this case",
    ", there is little point in speaking of indirect search , since annihilations of dm particles are not possible for lack of target antipartices .",
    "unless a mechanism such as dm - antidm oscillations intervenes to re - equilibrate the populations at late times and therefore re - switches on dm i d signals  @xcite .",
    "another belief which adds motivation to associating dm with the tev scale is that * new physics * is expected to show up at that scale , essentially to cure the standard model hierarchy problem .",
    "such new physics , whatever form it takes ( supersymmetry , extradimensions , compositeness ... ) likely encompasses a number of new particles , among which ( the conviction is ) the one constituting the dark matter .    in any case , even independently of the theory prejudices , this mass range ( * tev - ish dm * ) has the best chances of being thoroughly explored in the near future by charged particle and photon observatories , also in combination with direct dm searches ( aiming at detecting the nuclear recoil produced by a passing dm particle in ultra - low background underground detectors ) and , possibily , production at cern s large hadron collider . with notable exceptions ( axions , kev sterile neutrinos ... ) which however i will not discuss further , the tev - ish ballpark is therefore the focus of the attention of the largest majority of the dm i d community .",
    "an important corollary of the long - term fascination of the community for the wimp miracle , or more generally the thermal relic production mechanism , is that dm particles are expected to * annihilate in pairs * into standard model particles .",
    "more precisely , a velocity averaged annihilation cross section of @xmath7 is seen as the benchmark value , since it is the one that yields the correct relic abundance .",
    "deviations from this scheme are of course possible and have actually already been mentioned .",
    "for instance , dm that decays . or that annihilates into non - sm new states .",
    "+ in this write - up i pay the due respect to the long - term fascination , and also to the historical development : possible hints and bounds of dm in the cosmic rays are interpreted in the frame of dm particles _ annihilating into pairs of sm particles_. then , in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , i will briefly address the deviations from this scheme .",
    "there has been a flurry of positive results from a few indirect detection experiments looking at the fluxes of charged cosmic rays . in particular",
    ", the signals pointed to an * excess of electrons and positrons * at the tev and sub - tev scale :    * data from the pamela satellite  @xcite showed a steep increase in the energy spectrum of the positron fraction @xmath8 above 10  gev up to 100  gev , compatibly with previous hints from heat  @xcite and ams-01  @xcite . * recently , these findings have been confirmed with an independent measurement by the fermi satellite  @xcite , and extended to about 200 gev .",
    "* data from pamela  @xcite also showed no excess in the @xmath9 energy spectrum compared with the predicted background . * the balloon experiments atic-2  @xcite and ppb - bets  @xcite were reporting the presence of a peak in the @xmath10 energy spectrum at around 500 - 800  gev . *",
    "this sharp feature has been later questioned and superseded by the results of the fermi satellite  @xcite : while an excess with respect to the expected background is confirmed , the @xmath10 spectrum is found to be instead reproduced by a simple power law . *",
    "the hess telescope also reports the measurement of the @xmath10 energy spectrum above energies of 600 gev  @xcite , showing a power law spectrum in agreement with the one from fermi and eventually a steepening at energies of a few tev .",
    "the data are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargeddata ] , together with the expected * astrophysical ` backgrounds'*. the latter ones are uncertain and are an interesting subject of study by themselves in cr physics .",
    "for instance , the background positrons are thought to originate as byproducts ( ` secondaries ' ) of the spallations of other crs on the interstellar medium , but the precise prediction of their spectral slope and overall normalization is far from easy . in this vein , indeed , there have been initial suggestions attempting to ` explain away ' ( part of ) the pamela rise in terms of modified secondary spectra  @xcite , e.g. with a dip in the @xmath11 flux which enters in the denominator of the positron fraction .",
    "however , on the basis of pretty general cr propagation arguments and also in the light of subsequent measurements of the pure @xmath11 flux by pamela and fermi , these kinds of explanations have lost strenght  @xcite .",
    "the signals presented above are therefore striking because they imply the existence of a * source of _ ` primary ' _ @xmath12 ( and @xmath11 ) * other than the ordinary astrophysical ones .",
    "this unknown new source can well be itself of astrophysical nature  , e.g. one or more pulsar(s ) / pulsar wind nebula( ) , supernova remnants etc  @xcite .",
    "it is however very tempting to try and read in these ` excesses ' the signature of dm .",
    "as already mentioned above , the dm particles that constitute the dm halo of the milky way are expected to annihilate into pairs of primary sm particles ( such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and so on ) which , after decaying and through the processes of showering and hadronizing , give origin to * fluxes of energetic cosmic rays : @xmath17 * ( and also @xmath18-rays , @xmath19 ... ) , denoted @xmath20 . depending on which one has been the primary sm particle , the resulting spectra differ substantially in the details .",
    "generically , however , they feature a ` bump'-like shape , characterized by a high - energy cutoff at the dm particle mass and , for @xmath21 in particular , a softly decreasing tail at lower energies ( see e.g. the examples in fig .  [ fig : chargedfit ] ) .",
    "it is thus clear that it is very natural to expect a dm source to ` kick in ' on top of the secondary background and explain the @xmath21 excesses .",
    "the energy range , in particular , is tantalizingly right : the theoretically preferred tev - ish dm would naturally give origin to tev and sub - tev bumps and rises .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath22 produced in any given point of the halo * propagate * immersed in the turbulent galactic magnetic field .",
    "the field consists of random inhomogeneities that act as scattering centers for charged particles , so that their journey can effectively be described as a diffusion process from an extended source ( the dm halo ) to some final given point ( the location of the earth , in the case of interest ) .",
    "while diffusing , charged crs experience several other processes , and in particular energy losses due to synchrotron radiation , inverse compton scattering ( ics ) on the low energy photons of the cmb and starlight , coulomb losses , bremsstrahlung , nuclear spallations ....",
    "quantitatively , the steady - state number density @xmath23 per unit energy @xmath24 of the cosmic ray species @xmath25 @xmath26 ) in any given point @xmath27 obeys to a diffusion - loss equation  @xcite @xmath28 the first term accounts for diffusion , with a coefficient conventionally parameterized as @xmath29 .",
    "the second term describes energy losses : the coefficient @xmath30 is position - dependent since the intensity of the magnetic field ( which determines losses due to synchrotron radiation ) and the distribution of the photon field ( which determines losses due to ics ) vary across the galactic halo .",
    "the third term deals with convection while the last term accounts for nuclear spallations , that occur with rate @xmath31 in the disk of thickness @xmath32 pc .",
    "the different processes described above have a different importance depending on the particle species : the journey of electrons and positrons is primarily affected by synchrotron radiation and inverse compton energy losses , while for antiprotons these losses are negligible and convection and spallation dominate .",
    "+ the source , dm annihilations , is given by @xmath33 @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the dm mass , @xmath36 is the total annihilation cross section and the sum runs over all primary channels @xmath37 in which the cosmic ray species @xmath25 is produced .",
    "@xmath38 is the * dm density distribution * in the galactic halo .",
    "what to adopt for the latter is another one of the main open problems in the field .",
    "based on the results of increasingly more refined numerical simulations or on direct observations , profiles that differ even by several orders of magnitude at the galactic center are routinely adopted : e.g. the classical navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) or the einasto one , which exhibit a cusp at the galactic center , or the truncated isothermal or the burkert one , which feature a central core .",
    "all profiles , on the other hand , are roughly normalized at the same value at the location of the earth ( @xmath39 0.3 gev/@xmath40 ) .",
    "these features generically imply that observables which depend mostly on the local dm density ( for instance , the flux of high energy positrons , which can not come from far away due to energy losses ) will not be very affected by the choice of profile , while those that are sensitive to the density at the gc will be affected the most ( e.g. gamma rays observations of regions close to the gc ) .",
    "( [ eq : diffeq ] ) is usually solved numerically in a diffusive region with the shape of a solid flat cylinder that sandwiches the galactic plane , with height @xmath41 in the @xmath42 direction and radius @xmath43 in the @xmath44 direction .",
    "the location of the solar system corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "boundary conditions are imposed such that the number density @xmath46 vanishes on the surface of the cylinder , outside of which the charged cosmic rays freely propagate and escape .",
    "the values of the propagation parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are deduced from a variety of ( ordinary ) cosmic ray data and modelizations .",

    "more generally , the importance of such corrections has been appreciated only relatively recently , in a string of papers with varying scopes and levels of accuracy  @xcite . without entering in the details ,",
    "it is enough for my purposes to remind that ( i ) the corrections are particularly relevant for large dm masses ( above a tev ) ; ( ii ) they can alter significantly the i d fluxes , both in their spectral shape and in their amplitude , affecting especially the low energies portion  @xcite , and ( iii ) in some cases they can also largely modify the annihilation cross section itself , since they can lift the helicity suppression into light fermions  @xcite .",

    "[ theory ] . here",
    "we proceed along the lines of a phenomenological model - independent approach .",
    "given these tantalizing but surprising hints of dark matter annihilations in charged crs , it is now crucial to consider the associated signals in the photon fluxes that necessarily accompany them . in general",
    ", these photon fluxes can be produced by dm in different ways , among which :    * * ` prompt ' gamma - rays * : produced directly by dm annihilations themselves . in turn , however , these gamma - rays can originate from different stages of the annihilation process : * * from the bremsstrahlung of charged particles and the fragmentation of hadrons , e.g. @xmath65 , in the final states of the annihilations .",
    "these processes generically give origin to a _ continuum _ of @xmath18-rays which peaks at energies somewhat smaller than the dm mass @xmath35 , i.e.  typically in the @xmath18-ray energy range of tens of gev to multi - tev .",
    "the spectra can be computed in a model independent way ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , since all one needs to know is the pair of primary sm particles . * * from the _ bremsstrahlung _ from one of the _ internal _ particles in the annihilation diagram  @xcite .",
    "this typically gives rise to a sharp feature that peaks at an energy corresponding to the dm mass .",
    "the process is in general subdominant with respect to the continuum , but it can be particularly important in cases in which the continuum itself is suppressed by some mechanism , e.g. helicity arguments , which are lifted by the internal radiation . the spectrum from this contribution can not be computed without knowing the details of the annihilation model .",
    "* * from an annihilation directly into a pair of gamma - rays , which gives rise to a _ line _ spectrum at the energy corresponding to the mass of the dm . since dm is neutral , this annihilation has to proceed via some intermediation ( typically a loop of charged particles ) and it is therefore suppressed by ( typically ) 2 to 4 orders of magnitude . + in any case , since these @xmath18-rays originate directly from the annihilations themselves , their spatial distribution follows closely the distribution of dm .",
    "* * ics gamma - rays * : produced by the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of the energetic electrons and positrons , created in the dm annihilation , onto the low energy photons of the cmb , the galactic star - light and the infrared - light , which are thus upscattered in energy .",
    "typically , they cover a wider range of energies than prompt gamma rays , from energies of a fraction of the dm mass to almost up to the dm mass itself .",
    "their spatial distribution traces the distribution of @xmath21 , which originate from dm but then diffuse out in the whole galactic halo ( as seen above ) . * * synchrotron emission * : consisting in the radiation emitted in the magnetic field of the galaxy by the @xmath21 produced by dm annihilations . for an intensity of the magnetic field of @xmath66(@xmath67gauss ) , like in the case of the milky way halo , and for @xmath21 of gev - tev energies , the synchrotron emission falls in the mhz - ghz range , i.e. in the radio band . for large magnetic fields and large dm masses it can reach up to ehz , i.e. the x - ray band  @xcite .",
    "their region of origin is necessarily concentrated where the magnetic field is highest ; in particular the galactic center is the usual target of choice .",
    "however , it has been recently suggested that the galactic halo at large , or even the extragalactic ones , can be interesting sources  @xcite .",
    "individuating the * best targets * to search for these annihilation signals is one of the main games in the field .",
    "not very surprisingly , the preferred targets have to be * ( i ) * regions with high dm densities _ and/or _   * ( ii ) * regions where the astrophysical ` background ' is reduced and therefore the signal / noise ratio is favorable .",
    "the distinction between ( i ) and ( ii ) is of course not clear - cut , and of course there are specific cases in which other environmental reasons make a region more suitable than another ( such as in the case of synchrotron radiation which needs a region with a strong magnetic field ) .",
    "moreover , new promising targets keep being individuated .",
    "however , for the sake of schematizing , one can list the following targets at which the experiments look :    * the milky way galactic center ( gc ) @xmath68 * ( i ) * * small regions around or just outside the gc , such as the galactic ridge ( gr , an area enclosed within galactic longitude @xmath69 and latitude @xmath70 ) , the galactic center halo ( gch , an annulus of about @xmath71 around the gc , excluding the galactic plane ) etc @xmath68 * ( i ) * + * ( ii ) * * wide regions of the galactic halo ( gh ) itself ( such as observational windows centered at the gc and several tens of degrees wide in latitude and longitude , or the so called ` intermediate - latitude strips ' defined by @xmath72 , or the galactic poles at @xmath73 ) , from which a diffuse flux of gamma - rays is expected , including the one due to the ics emission from the diffused population of @xmath21 from dm annihilations @xmath68 * ( ii ) * * globular clusters ( gloc ) , which are dense agglomerates of stars , embedded in the milky way galactic halo .",
    "they are a peculiar kind of target since they are not supposed to be dm dominated , quite the opposite , as they are rich of stars .",
    "the interest in them arises from two facts : that they may have formed inside a primordial dm subhalo and some of the dm may have remained trapped ; that the density of baryonic matter may create by attraction a dm spike and thus enhance the annihilation flux@xmath68 * ( i ) * * subhalos of the galactic dm halo , the position of which , however , is of course not known a priori . in a similar class , intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) have recently attracted some attention  @xcite , because they could create around them spikes of dm @xmath68 * ( i)*. * satellite galaxies of the milky way , often of the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) class , such as sagittarius , segue1 , draco and several others , which are star - deprived and believed to be dm dominated @xmath68 * ( i ) * + * ( ii ) * * large scale structures in the relatively nearby universe , such as galaxy clusters ( e.g. the virgo , coma , fornax , perseus clusters , and several others with catalog names that are less pleasant to write ) @xmath68 * ( i ) * + * ( ii ) * * the universe at large , meaning looking at the _ isotropic _ flux of ( redshifted ) @xmath18-rays that come to us from dm annihilation in all halos and all along the recent history of the universe .",
    "often this flux is called ` extragalactic ' or ` cosmological ' @xmath68 * ( ii ) * * * it has also been suggested that experiments look at the angular _ anisotropies _ of this ( at first order ) isotropic flux of diffuse gamma rays , since they should exist if annihilations happen in granular cosmological halos  @xcite .",
    "a similar program has been suggested at the galactic scale  @xcite ( it may also be listed in the ` subhalos ' point above ) .",
    "focussing on the range of energies above a gev or so ( i.e. proper gamma rays ) , the current * main experiments * in the game are the fermi satellite and the ground - based imaging atmospheric erenkov telescopes ( iact ) .    *",

    "the latter found that , removing previously - unaccounted - for astrophysical point sources , the evidence in  @xcite evaporates and actually one can impose stringent bounds ( possibly the most stringent ones ) using the very same virgo cluster observation .",
    "let s now come to ` 130 gev line ' claim ( for a more thorough review see  @xcite ) .",
    "originally spotted by  @xcite and , above all , by  @xcite in the publicly available fermi data from an extended region including the gc , it has later found support in other analyses  @xcite , with varying degrees of accuracy and claimed significance . @xcite",

    "antideuterons can be produced by dark matter via the * coalescence * of an antiproton and an antineutron originating from an annihilation event , provided that the latter ones are produced with momenta that are spatially alligned and comparable in magnitude  @xcite .",
    "this peculiar kinematics in the production mechanism implies two things .",
    "one , that the flux of @xmath81 from dm is ( unfortunately ) predicted to be much lower than the one of other , more readily produced , charged cosmic rays .",
    "two , that ( fortunately ) the flux peaks in an energy region , corresponding typically to a fraction of a gev , where very little astrophysical background @xmath81 s are present , since the latter ones are believed to originate in spallations of high energy cosmic ray protons on the interstellar gas at rest , a completely different kinematical situation .",

    "cosmology deserves a short paragraph of its own within a mini - review dedicated to dark matter indirect detection , because it can impose very relevant constraints on the annihilation cross section .",
    "this does not refer to the cosmological mechanism of production of dm ( which can give at best a suggestion for a natural value of @xmath36 , as discussed in the introduction ) , but instead to later phases in the history of the universe on which dm annihilations can leave an impact .",
    "the basic physics mechanism is that * dm annihilations inject energy and energetic particles * in the primordial medium , and therefore affect its evolution .",
    "the constraints come essentially from two cosmological probes : big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "* the injection of electromagnetic radiation or high - energy hadrons during or after * bbn * can have several effects on the newly formed light nuclei , destroying some species and overproducing others  @xcite , therefore altering their final abundances and spoiling the agreement with observations .",
    "the bounds found in  @xcite vary in the range @xmath83/sec ( for a 1 tev dm mass ) , depending on the dm annihilation channel and the light element which is used .",
    "they lie therefore quite above the value of the thermal cross section and they are also generically not strong enough to significantly constraint the dm interpretation of the charged crs excesses ( especially because leptophilic channels are constrained the least ) . * concerning * cmb * , the actual physical effect of energy injection around the recombination epoch is that it ionizes the gas and therefore results in an increased amount of free electrons , which survive to lower redshifts and affect the cmb anisotropies .",
    "this has been analyzed with increasing accuracy in a string of papers  @xcite .",
    "detailed constraints have been recently derived in  @xcite , based on the most recent cmb data from wmap and other observatories .",
    "the constraints are somewhat sensitive to the dominant dm annihilation channel : annihilation modes for which a portion of the energy is carried away by neutrinos or stored in protons have a lesser impact on the cmb ; on the contrary the annihilation mode which produces directly @xmath84 is the most effective one . in absolute terms , these constraints are among the most stringent ones on the dm annihilation cross section ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cosmology ] ) : they exclude the dm interpretation of the charged crs excesses and they can rule out thermal dm with masses below 10 gev or so .",
    "by definition , dm i d deals with features embedded in astrophysical signals , and therefore is ` contaminated ' by the uncertainties that affect the latter ones .",
    "in addition , there are specific uncertainties related to the dm itself and its particle physics origin .",

    "as briefly mentioned in sec .",
    "[ chargedscent ] , adopting a peaked versus a cored profiled may make a difference of orders of magnitude in the prediction of the signals from dm , especially for those coming from the gc .",
    "* * how reliable are the predictions we obtain from dm simulations ?",

    "beyond that , we rely on extrapolations , sometimes of many orders of magnitude . * * what is the effect of baryons on the dm profile ? baryons ( i.e. ordinary matter making up clouds , stars , black holes and all the associated phenomena ) start only now to be included in dm simulations .",
    "they could either steepen the dm profile at the center , thanks to adiabatic contraction , or smoothen it due to friction .",
    "* * what is the local density of dm ?",
    "its value affects the normalization of the expected fluxes from the local environment but also that of the dm profiles in general . *",
    "* what is the velocity distribution of dm particles in the galactic halo ?",
    "the details of the velocity distribution of dm particles , including the escape velocity , mainly affect the nuclear recoil experiments of direct detection , but also some i d signatures , for instance the capture of dm particles in the sun and thus the flux of neutrinos . *",
    "the * propagation * of charged cr .",
    "the propagation of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath85 in the galaxy , sketched in sec .",
    "[ chargedscent ] , contains a number of uncertain parameters : the diffusion coefficient ( its normalization and energy dependence ) , the energy loss parameters , the values of the convective ( and re - acceleration ) velocity , the thickness of the diffusion box , the size of the effect of approaching the solar sphere ... the fact that we can not precisely predict them traces back to our fundamental ignorance about the details of the magnetic field inhomogeneities in the galaxy , of the gas distribution , of background light , of solar - generated fields etc",
    ". we can determine reasonable ranges of values for these parameters , fitting a number of _ ordinary _ cosmic ray data , but still dm predictions can differ by more than one order of magnitude when the parameters are varied within these ranges .",
    "progress in better understanding cr propagation will undoubtedly bring much progress in the dm field as well . * * particle physics * uncertainties .",
    "this refers of course not to the unknown particle properties of dm such as the annihilation cross section or channels , which are the parameters to discover , but to the intervening tools from particle physics that are used to predict dm signatures .",
    "* * for instance , almost every dm indirect search analysis uses the collider montecarlo code pythia  @xcite to compute the annihilation spectra , despite the fact that other codes are available and that in any case all codes have been designed and calibrated for the collider environment and in an energy range which ( until recently ) was much lower than the multi - tev one of interest for some dm models . in ref .",
    "@xcite the uncertainty related to mc issues is tentatively quoted at @xmath86 , although bigger surprises are possible for some channels . * * some initially overlooked particle physics effects may turn out to be important , such as the ew corrections mentioned in sec .",
    "[ chargedscent ] . * * some signals depend on poorly known nuclear or particle physics aspects , like e.g. the coalescence process for antideuterons . * the astrophysical * ` background'*. while technically not an uncertainty affecting the predictions from dm , the astrophysical background is arguably the source of most of the uncertainty affecting the interpretation of the i d signals in terms of dm . in every channel , knowing what can be ascribed to common ( or even peculiar , but ordinary ) astrophysics is the most important ingredient to be able to single out the exotic contribution .",
    "there is obviously no straightforward solution , but ( i ) to continuosly improve our knowledge of such backgrounds and ( ii ) to break the degeneracy requiring a genuine signal to be multimessenger , i.e. sticking out on top of at least two ( hopefully unrelated ) ` backgrounds ' .",
    "inspired by the flurry of data discussed above , the field of dm model building has experienced a huge surge of activity in the latest few years .",
    "this is essentially because the dm properties individuated by the charged cr signals , and the associated constraints , pose a tough * challenge for the traditional dm candidates*. let us take the supersymmetric neutralino as a strawman and see how it fares as a candidate for the dm phenomenology outlined in page  : ( i ) the data require a multi - tev dm mass , but this fits rather uncomfortably in a theory , such as susy , whose typical scale should be close to the mass of the higgs boson , if naturalness is a valid criterion .",
    "( ii ) the data require leptophilicness , but typical neutralino annihilation channels do not distinguish between leptons and quarks , and often couple to gauge bosons , so a dangerous component of hadrons is generically expected .",
    "( iii ) the data require a huge annihilation cross section into relatively light final states such as leptons , but the neutralino is a majorana particle and , as such , its ( @xmath87-wave ) annihilation cross section is helicity suppressed by a large factor of @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the fermion mass .",
    "the scorecard for the neutralino does not look great .",
    "of course these generic arguments can be circumvented in specific situations .",
    "indeed several works have argued that it _ is _ possible to explain the cr excesses insisting on an mssm dm candidate  @xcite .",
    "this , however , happens at the price of finely tuning at least some aspect : the properties of the @xmath22 background , the position of a nearby dm clump , assuming ( uplifted ) resonances , finding just few configurations in a scatter plot , explaining only the positron rise and leaving the rest to ad - hoc astrophysics ... .",
    "these examples are therefore perceived as somewhat anecdotical .",
    "similar arguments would apply for other ` traditional ' dm frameworks , e.g. kaluza - klein ( extradimensional ) dm .",
    "this is why the community has preferred to explore new model building possibilities and a lot of works have been published since 2008  @xcite . before sketching the main directions of this activity ,",
    "let us first address an aspect which finds application in several models : how to obtain the large flux .",
    "so the question is : is it possible to reconcile the very large value of the annihilation rate ( corresponding to @xmath90 ) required ` today ' to fit the cr excesses and the smaller value ( corresponding to @xmath91 ) individuated by the paradigm of dm production as a thermal relic in the early universe ?",
    "more generically , and thinking beyond the current cr excesses , a large flux would greatly increase our hopes for detection : are there ways to naturally obtain large rates ?",
    "the ingenuity of theorists has found at least three positive possible answers to these questions .",
    "yes , it is possible : ...    * via an astrophysical * boost factor * : the presence , in today s galactic halo , of dm overdensities predicted by numerical simulations boosts the annihilation rate ( proportional to the squared density of dm particles ) .",
    "if the boost could reach a @xmath92 value , this would explain why the rate is much larger today , without modifying the cross section itself .",
    "the typical realistic values , however , have been proven to be @xmath93 at most  @xcite . * annihilating via a * resonance *  @xcite : if the resonance mass is just below twice the dm mass , the annihilation cross section becomes sensitive to the details of the velocity distribution of the dm particles ; since ( on average ) dm particles are slower today than in the early universe , many more of them meet the conditions of resonant annihilation and therefore the rate is enhanced , provided that the relevant parameters are appropriately fine tuned .",
    "typically one needs the mass of the resonance to differ by less than 1% from twice the dm mass and the width of the resonance to be of the order of @xmath94 of its mass , in order to obtain an enhancement of @xmath95 . *",
    "thanks to the * sommerfeld enhancement * ( see  @xcite , and then  @xcite ) , a non - perturbative effect which modifies the annihilation cross section in the regime of _ small relative velocity _ of the annihilating particles and in presence of an effectively _ long - range force _ between them .",
    "indeed this well known quantum mechanical effect , first discussed by sommerfeld in the context of positronium @xmath84 annihilations under the effect of resummed @xmath18 exchanges , can occur in dm annihilations if the two annihilating particles exchange an interaction mediated by a force carrier of mass @xmath96 and with a coupling constant @xmath97 such that @xmath98 .",
    "for very heavy dm particles ( @xmath99 tev ) , the exchange of sm weak bosons can mediate the effect , in which case @xmath100 is just the one of weak interactions and @xmath101 gev .",
    "if a new force exist , however , mediated by a particle with mass @xmath102 gev and gauge - like coupling strength with dm particles only , even dm particles of mass @xmath103 1 tev would enjoy the sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "the details of the enhancement of the cross  section are model dependent ( see  @xcite for some examples ) , but some general features can be identified : in particular , the enhancement shows an inverse proportionality with the relative velocity of the two particles , and it typically saturates to a maximum value when that is @xmath104 .    while in some models",
    "the enhancement factors discussed above are natural or even unavoidable  , it is fair to say that in many cases they have been used quite liberally in model building , along the lines of ` if i miss a factor of @xmath105 to fit the data , i throw in a , b or c , or a combination thereof , until i get @xmath105 '   50 in  @xcite , introduced after the cr data showed that a little bit more of an enhancement was needed , just to mention an example that i know well . ] .",
    "perhaps precisely for this reason , they have been studied in detail and they have become kind of a tool in the model builder toolbox .",
    "so they are likely to stay with us in the near future .",
    "a possible categorization of the intense model building work of the past few years would identify the following classes :    * * minimalistic * dark matter models .",
    "these are models loosely identified by the fact that they aim at providing a viable dm candidate insisting on introducing the minimal set of new particles beyond the standard model .",
    "they arised originally in opposition to the mainstream direction of obtaining dm as a byproduct of a more ambitious and comprehensive theory , such as susy or extra dimensions .",
    "the namesake minimal dark matter ( mdm )  @xcite falls in this class , as well as less fundamentalist theories such as the model in  @xcite , the hidden vector  @xcite , the inert doublet model ( idm )  @xcite and others .",
    "+ thanks to their relative simplicity , the models in this class are often free of many free parameter and therefore are quite predictive : their i d signatures can be computed and compared univocally with data .",
    "the mdm model , featuring , in its minimal realization , a 9.6 tev dm particle annihilating almost exclusively into @xmath16 , initially excited its authors since it had predicted the size and shape of the positron rise ( and the @xmath22 null result ) in pamela , provided that an astrophysical boost factor of @xmath77 50 was adopted .",
    "later it has been disfavored by the fermi+hess @xmath21 data , which prefer a lower mass , and @xmath18-ray data , see e.g.  @xcite ( it remains a viable dm candidate albeit obviously not an explanation for the cr excesses for a smaller and , by the way , more realistic astrophysical boost factor ) .",
    "the phenomenology of the idm shares a similar history  @xcite .",
    "* models with * new dark forces * or , more generically , a rich dark sector . in this class",
    "fall most of the models whose construction has been directly stimulated by the cr excesses .",
    "+ the model which undoubtedly has most attracted attention and has best spelled out the ingredients is presented in  @xcite , although similar ideas have been proposed before or around the same time  @xcite .",
    "the model in  @xcite features a tev - ish dm particle which is sterile under the sm gauge group but which interacts with itself via a new force - carrying boson @xmath106 ( with the strength of typical gauge couplings ) .",
    "the dm annihilation therefore proceeds through dm dm @xmath107 . a small mixing between @xmath106 and the electromagnetic current assures that @xmath106 eventually decays .",
    "therefore the process of dm annihilation occurs in 2 steps : first two dm s go into two @xmath106 s and then each @xmath106 s , thanks to its mixing with a photon , goes into a couple of sm particles .",
    "the crucial ingredient is that the mass of @xmath106 is chosen to be light , of the order of @xmath103 1 gev .",
    "this simple assumption , remarkably , kills two birds with a stone .",
    "on one side , the exchange of @xmath106 realizes the sommerfeld enhancement discussed in sec .",
    "[ enhancements ] , thus providing a very large annihilation cross section today but preserving the thermal production of dm in the early universe . on the other side , @xmath106 can only decay into sm particles lighter than a gev , i.e. electrons , muons and possibly pions , but not protons : this assures that the annihilation is leptophilic , for a simple kinematical reason .",
    "the model therefore fulfils all the requirements listed in page  .",
    "the construction can then be complicated _ ad libitum _",
    ", e.g. assuming that the dark gauge group is non - abelian and the dm sits in a multiplet of such group , with small splitting between the components .",
    "this allows to accommodate other experimental anomalies , not discussed here .",
    "+ the kinematical argument is not the only one available to justify a leptophilic nature for dm .",
    "in the literature , variations have been proposed in which dm is coupled preferentially to leptons because it carries a lepton number  @xcite , because it shares a quantum number with a lepton  @xcite , because quarks live on another brane  @xcite or ... ` because i say so '  @xcite .",
    "+ the indirect detection phenomenology of these theories has of course been worked out in detail  @xcite . in short",
    ", they can easily provide a fit to the charged cr excesses as good as , or better than , the one from ordinary annihilating dm , also thanks to the fact that the 2-step annihilation softens the spectrum of final @xmath21 and allows a better agreement with the data .",
    "they are also subject to the same constraints from neutrinos and especially gamma rays : the bottom line of a series of analyses  @xcite is that , while the bounds are somewhat alleviated ( essentially thanks to the smaller yield of @xmath18-rays and the softening of the spectra mentioned above ) , there still remain a tension .",
    "the conclusion of , e.g. ,  @xcite , which also considers cosmological constraints , is that it is possible for these models to constitute an explanation of the cr excesses while remaining consistent with the constraints , albeit barely and at the condition of assuming a specific admixture of 4@xmath108 and 4@xmath67 final states and quite a specific mass for @xmath106 . * * decaying dark matter*. the possibility that dark matter consists of a particle that actually decays on a very long time scale has been considered since a long time , e.g. in the context of gravitino dm with r - parity violation  @xcite .",
    "+ more recently , this option has gained steam ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , precisely because of the cosmic ray excesses and the difficulty of explaining them with annihilating dm . indeed ,",
    "if the decay half - life is tuned to @xmath109 seconds ( a figure possibly motivated by some high enegy physics scale suppressed operators )   is so much longer than the age of the universe that the slow decay does not make a dent in the overall cosmological dm abundance and does not spoil the agreement with a number of astrophysical and cosmological observations , including the cosmic microwave background  @xcite . ] and if the production of hadrons is adequately suppressed by some a priori unrelated mechanism , the features needed to fit the data are obtained .",
    "a crucial advantage is also that gamma ray ( and neutrino ) constraints are in general less severe in these scenarios , as they are proportional to the first power of the dm density ( and not the second , like for annihilations ) .",
    "+ the i d phenomenology of decaying dm has been studied in detail  @xcite . generally speaking , it is not much different from the phenomenology of annihilating dm , modulo a few points : i ) decay channels other than the ordinary particle - antiparticle pair become possible for fermionic dm ( e.g. dm @xmath110 , dm @xmath111 ) ; ii ) the local spectrum of charged cr is often somewhat harder for decaying dm than for annihilating dm , since in the latter case a sizable fraction of low energy particles manage to diffuse to the earth from the high production regions in the inner galaxy , softening the spectrum .",
    "all in all , it is possible to find fits to the data as good as , or even better than , those of ordinary annihilating dm .",
    "on the other hand , as anticipated , the gamma ray constraints from the galaxy are not as stringent as in the case of annihilating dm .",
    "the most stringent bounds come from the isotropic @xmath18 flux  @xcite and , recently , from galaxy clusters in fermi data  @xcite : in both cases decay half - lives shorter than @xmath77 few @xmath112 sec or even up to @xmath113 sec ( with the precise value depending on the @xmath35 and the decay channel ) are excluded  .",
    "this represents a serious blow for the decaying dm interpretation of the cr excesses :  @xcite shows that they are ruled out unless very conservative choices are adopted .",
    "the cmb constraints turn out to be not competitive for decaying dm  @xcite .",
    "* this section documents a current event . *",
    "+ information may change rapidly as the event progresses .",
    "_ ( august 2012 ) _    the findings briefly introduced in sec .",
    "[ gammaclaims ] have started inspiring some model building activity in the latest few months ( for a more thorough review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the exercise is : produce a @xmath78 line ( or something narrow enough to look like a line ) with relative cross section @xmath114 .",
    "the starting point is well known : since dm is electrically neutral , it does not directly couple to photons and therefore one needs some mediating mechanism in order to produce the @xmath78 pair : ( i ) via a loop of charged particles , which can be sm ones  @xcite , supersymmetric ones  @xcite or from a new sector  @xcite ; ( ib ) via chern - simons terms  @xcite , the remnants of loops that have been integrated - away ; ( ii ) via a normally subdominant dm - photon coupling , e.g. a magnetic dipole  @xcite ; ( iii ) via axions  @xcite    as another option , one may produce a ` top - hat ' gamma ray spectrum by having dm annihilate into two metastable states @xmath106 that then decay into @xmath78 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : the spectrum is flat between the edges @xmath115 , so for @xmath116 close enough to @xmath35 the top - hat fakes a line .",
    "next , one is confronted to two possible ( possibly related ) problems : the added ` mediator ' physics usually implies that the @xmath78 process is suppressed with respect to other processes ( for instance , the tree level annihilation into the particles running in the loops of ( i ) ) , but the needed @xmath117 required by fermi data is relatively large and therefore the ` other processes ' are expected to have an even larger @xmath118 , with the result that : ( 1 ) they might be constrained by other observations ( e.g. by fermi data themselves , as discussed in sec .  [ gammaclaims ] ) ; ( 2 ) they might tend to give a too large annihilation in the early universe and therefore an insufficient yield of the thermal dm abundance .",
    "this latter point is similar to the one already encountered for the charged cr anomalies ( see sec .",
    "[ enhancements ] ) , so that some of the tools already explored might apply .",
    "additional proposed solutions include : ( a ) assuming that the tree level process is not accessible kinematically ( e.g. the particles in the loop are heavier than the c.o.m .",
    "energy , i.e. the dm mass  @xcite ) , ( b ) engineering other mechanisms which obtain a correct relic abundance but which turn off today ( e.g. coannihilations ) , ( c ) decoupling the relic dm from the one that produces signal , in model with multi - component dm , ( d ) giving up altogether the thermal relic mechanism   see  @xcite for a lucid summary .",
    "another quite generic ` theory ' consequence is that , wherever you can attach a @xmath18 emission you can usually also attach a @xmath64 or a @xmath3 emission , with the result that another line is expected at an energy @xmath119 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "like possibly other fields in particle physics in these days , the one of dark matter indirect detection is currently characterized by an exciting mix of tantalizing hints , increasingly stringent constraints and ever rising hopes .",
    "according to my taste , and to the material presented above , i would classify :    * * hints * : the @xmath12 and @xmath21 excesses in pamela , fermi and hess .",
    "+ if interpreted in terms of dm annihilations , these point to a rather preposterous particle : multi - tev , leptophilic and with a huge annihilation cross section .",
    "+ the ` 130 gev line ' in fermi data .",
    "+ if interpreted in terms of dm annihilations , this seems to point to particle which reassures at first and then puzzles : its mass - scale and its spatial distribution are consistent with the phenomenologists best dreams , but the large cross section is unsettling . * * constraints * : the @xmath18-ray measurements from fermi and hess ( and , to a smaller extent , veritas and the other erenkov telescopes ) , the neutrino measurements from superkamiokande and icecube and the cmb bounds based on wmap . + these rule out most or all of the parameter space for the preposterous dm above .",
    "they also put in a difficult spot some of the more exotic models discussed in sec .",
    "[ theorydirections ] .",
    "+ on the other hand , they show how far - reaching these kinds of searches can be .",
    "they are starting to explore the parameter space of ordinary ( thermally produced ) dm and already rule out the lower mass portion of the tens - of - gev range . * * hopes * : from the point of view of data , the @xmath18-ray ( and , probably to a smaller extent , the neutrino ) telescopes will continue to play a major role : they will keep up their march across the parameter space and at some point they may see something totally convincing . the ams-02 detector , onboard of the international space station , will probably deliver data in 2012 : if the @xmath21 excesses are of astrophysical origin ( as it is probably judicious to believe ) then they constitute a formidable background to any future signal from dm in this channel ; we have to place our hopes in another channel : the @xmath22 one looks promising , and the @xmath81 one ( also explored by the gaps experiment ) may reserve surprises .",
    "+ from the point of view of theory , the single most striking result of the recent activity is that the community has diversified its interests and explored many new directions , both in terms of phenomena that might enhance the dm signal ( see sec .  [ enhancements ] ) and in terms of model - building ( see sec .  [ theorydirections ] and  [ theorydirectionsline ] ) .",
    "the hope is that one or more of these interesting ramifications will bear fruit soon .",
    "i thank all my collaborators for the work performed together and for useful discussions , in particular paolo panci , alessandro strumia , gabrijela zaharijas and above all pasquale serpico .",
