    "exist the transition radiation detector ( trd ) ( top ) and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) ( bottom ) .",
    "both will provide ams with capability to discriminate between leptons and hadrons . additionally the calorimeter will trigger and detect photons .",
    "the trd will be followed by the first of the four time - of - flight ( tof ) system scintillator planes .",
    "the tof is composed of four roughly circular planes of 12 cm wide scintillator paddles , one pair of planes above the magnet , the upper tof , and one pair bellow , the lower tof",
    ". there will be a total of 34 paddles .",
    "the tof will provide a fast trigger within 200ns , charge and velocity measurements for charged particles , as well as information on their direction of incidence .",
    "the tof operation at regions with very intense magnetic fields forces the use of shielded fine mesh phototubes and the optimization of the light guides geometry , with some of them twisted and bent .",
    "moreover the system guarantees redundancy , with two photomultipliers on each end of the paddles and double redundant electronics .",
    "a time resolution of 140ps for protons is .",
    "the tracking system will be surrounded by veto counters and embedded in a magnetic field of about 0.9tesla produced by a superconducting magnet .",

    "there will be a total of @xmath42500 silicon sensors arranged on 192 ladders .",
    "the position of the charged particles crossing the tracker layers is measured with a precision of @xmath410@xmath7 m along the bending plane and @xmath430@xmath7 m on the transverse direction . with a bending power ( bl@xmath6 ) of around 0.9t.m@xmath6 ,",
    "particles rigidity is measured with an accuracy better than 2% up to 20gv and the maximal detectable rigidity is around 1 - 2tv .",
    "electric charge is also measured from energy deposition up to z@xmath426 .",
    "the ring imaging erenkov  detector ( rich ) @xcite will be located right after the last tof plane and before the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "it will be described in detail in next section .",
    "[ fig : ams ]    the long stay of ams in space and its large acceptance will allow the accumulation of a large statistic of events increasing in several orders of magnitude the sensitivity of the proposed physical measurements . with an average collection rate of 1000 events per second",
    ", a total of @xmath8 protons per year and around @xmath9 antiprotons will be accumulated .",
    "the main goals of the ams-02 experiment are :    * a precise measurement of the charged cosmic ray spectrum between and @xmath41tev , and the detection of photons up to a few hundred gev ; * a search for heavy antinuclei ( @xmath10 ) , which if discovered would signal the existence of primordial antimatter ; * search for non - baryonic dark matter through the detection of annihilation products appearing as anomalies of the cosmic - ray spectra ( e@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) ;",
    "the rich is a proximity focusing device with a dual radiator configuration on the top made of 92 aerogel 25 mm thick tiles with a refractive index 1.050 and sodium fluoride ( naf ) tiles with a thickness of 5 mm in the center covering an area of 34@xmath1534cm@xmath6 .",
    "the naf placement prevents the loss of photons in the hole existing in the center of the readout plane ( @xmath17 cm@xmath6 ) , in front of the ecal calorimeter located below .",
    "the radiator tiles are supported by a 1 mm thick layer of methacrylate ( n=1.5 ) free of uv absorbing additives .",
    "the detection matrix is composed of 680 multiplixelized photon readout cells each consisting of a photomultiplier coupled to a light guide , hv divider plus front - end ( fe ) electronics , all housed and potted in a plastic shell and then enclosed in a magnetic shielding with a thickness varying from 0.8 to 1.2 mm .",
    "the photon detection is made with an array of multianode hamamatsu tubes ( r7600 - 00-m16 ) with a spectral response ranging from 300 to 650 nm and a maximum quantum efficiency at @xmath18@xmath4420 nm . to increase the photon collection efficiency ,",
    "a light guide consisting of 16 solid acrylic pipes glued to a thin top layer ( 1 mm ) was produced .",
    "it is optically coupled to the active area of phototube cathode through a @xmath19 mm flexible optical pad . with a total height of @xmath20 mm and a collecting surface of @xmath21 mm@xmath6",
    ", it presents a readout pixel size of @xmath22 mm and a pitch of 37 mm . the light guide is mechanically attached through nylon wires to the photomultiplier polycarbonate housing .",
    "a high reflectivity conical mirror surrounds the whole set .",
    "the mirror was included to increase the device acceptance since around 33% of the aerogel generated photons impact on the mirror .",
    "it consists of a carbon fiber reinforced composite substrate with a multilayer coating made of aluminium and sio@xmath23 deposited on the inner surface .",
    "this ensures a reflectivity higher than 85% for 420 nm wavelength photons .",

    "the total height of the detector is 60.5 cm and it covers 80% of the ams magnet acceptance . shows a schematic view of the rich detector .",
    "rich was designed to measure the velocity ( @xmath24 ) of singly charged particles with a resolution @xmath25 of 0.1@xmath26 , to extend the charge separation ( z ) up to iron ( z=26 ) , to contribute to @xmath27 separation and to albedo rejection .    in order to validate the rich design ,",
    "a prototype with an array of 9@xmath1511 cells filled with 96 photomultiplier readout units similar to part of the matrix of the final model was constructed .",
    "the performance of this prototype has been tested with cosmic muons and with a beam of secondary ions at the cern sps produced by fragmentation of a primary beam in 2002 and 2003 .",
    "the light guides used were prototypes with a slightly smaller collecting area ( 31@xmath1531mm@xmath6 ) .",
    "different samples of the radiator materials were tested and placed at an adjustable supporting structure .",
    "different expansion heights were set in order to have fully contained photon rings on the detection matrix like in the flight design .",
    "a segment of a conical mirror with 1/12 of the final azimuthal coverage , which is shown in left picture of , was also tested .",
    "the rich assembly has already started at ciemat in spain and is foreseen to be finished in july 2007 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     runs with a mirror prototype were also performed and its reflectivity was derived from data analysis .",
    "the obtained value is in good agreement with the design value .",
    "ams-02 will be equipped with a proximity focusing rich detector based on a mixed radiator of aerogel and sodium fluoride , enabling velocity measurements with a resolution of about 0.1% and extending the charge measurements up to the iron element .",
    "velocity reconstruction is made with a likelihood method .",
    "charge reconstruction is made in an event - by - event basis .",
    "evaluation of both algorithms on real data taken with in - beam tests at cern , in october 2003 was done .",
    "the detector design was validated and a refractive index 1.05 aerogel was chosen for the radiator , fulfilling both the demand for a large light yield and a good velocity resolution .",
