    "since a quantum computer ( qc ) will exhibit advantages over its classical counterpart only when a large number of qubits can be manipulated coherently , many architectures of qcs based on scalable physical systems have been investigated@xcite . among these candidates ,",
    "ultra - cold neutral atoms trapped in the periodic potentials of an optical lattice are attracting much attention@xcite . since neutral atoms couple weakly to the environment ,",
    "decoherence is suppressed greatly . besides , some typical many - body models can be constructed in optical lattice systems .",
    "this makes it possible to use quantum optical methods to study fundamental condensed - matter physics problems@xcite .    in the schemes for qcs based on optical lattice system ,",
    "the couplings between nearest neighbor atoms in the lattice can be simultaneously switched on and off by adjusting the intensity , frequency , and polarization of the trapping light .",
    "however , it is difficult to focus a laser beam on a single atom due to the short lattice period .",
    "this makes it challenging to realize controlled collisions and perform single and two qubit logical operations . a possible approach to overcome the difficulty of addressing the atoms",
    "individually is based on marker qubits@xcite , i.e. , by using two types of atoms with different internal states in the optical lattice .",
    "one type of atoms act as marker qubits to address logical qubits .",
    "another method is one way quantum computation@xcite . in this proposal ,",
    "the couplings between adjacent atoms can be utilized to prepare the atoms in a high dimensional cluster state .",
    "after the initialization , one can enlarge the lattice period to single qubit addressable range .",
    "universal quantum computation can then be implemented simply via a series of single qubit measurements .",
    "of course , one way quantum computation requires a great qubit overhead .",
    "recently , a series of schemes for quantum computation based on global operations only were proposed . in these schemes , local",
    "addressability become unnecessary@xcite .",
    "remarkably , raussendorf devised a novel scheme for universal quantum computation via translation - invariant operations on a chain of qubits@xcite , in which only the nearest neighbor ising - type interaction and translation - invariant single qubit unitary operations are required .",
    "inspired by these proposals , in this letter we present a scheme for quantum computation based on global operations in qubit arrays only .",
    "here , we develop a general method to realize single qubit unitary operations via global but periodic manipulation .",
    "compared with the quantum cellular automata scheme@xcite , encoding overhead is eliminated in our proposal .",
    "in addition , single qubit operation is easier than in raussendorf s scheme@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we show that universal quantum computation in one dimensional arrays can be realized via global but periodic manipulation .",
    "we also display that the preparation for initial states and the measurement for final states can be implemented by using this global manipulation .",
    "furthermore , in sec.iii , we discuss quantum computation and quantum simulation in high dimensional arrays .",
    "we find the implementation of the periodic operations in the finite lattice will benefit from global manipulation .",
    "section iv contains some conclusions .",
    "let us first consider a two - component bosonic atomic mixture trapped in one dimension by two spin - dependent lattice potentials . each atom is assumed to have two relevant internal states , which are denoted with the effective spin index @xmath0 , @xmath1 , respectively . in the mott insulator regime",
    ", the system can be described by a two - component bose - hubbard hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath2 here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are creation and annihilation operators for bosonic atoms of spin @xmath5 localized on - site @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . under the condition that @xmath8 and @xmath9 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) is equivalent to the following @xmath10 type interaction hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath11 .",
    "\\label{eq2}\\ ] ] here , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 satisfy @xmath15 = 2i\\epsilon _ { \\alpha \\beta \\gamma } \\sigma _ i^\\gamma $ ] .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "remarkably , the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be easily controlled by adjusting the intensity of the trapping laser beam or an external field@xcite .",
    "therefore , the following well - known spin @xmath20 interaction models can be realized : ising model @xmath21 , @xmath22 model @xmath23 , and heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) model @xmath24 .",
    "besides hamiltonian @xmath25 , in order to implement universal quantum computation , we introduce the following effective periodic magnetic field : @xmath26 \\sigma _ i^\\alpha , ( \\alpha = x , y , z ) \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] here , we set the distance between the nearest neighbor sites as unity .",
    "@xmath27 is the period of the magnetic field , when @xmath28 , @xmath29 reduces to a homogeneous magnetic field . to realize this periodic magnetic field",
    ", we set the eigenstates @xmath30 and @xmath31 to have the same energy . by the left and the right circularly polarized light ,",
    "they are separately coupled to the common exited level @xmath32 with a blue detuning @xmath33 . in such a 3-level system , we can obtain the effective hamiltonians @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 in the 2 dimensional hilbert space spanned by @xmath37 and @xmath38 only by adjusting the polarization of coupling light@xcite .",
    "thus , for the cold atoms trapped in one dimensional lattice , we may construct such a periodic potential field @xmath39 along the lattice direction by applying a monochromatic standing wave laser beam .",
    "in addition , in our scheme , we require the ability to adjust the period of the effective magnetic field @xmath29 . to this end",
    ", we split a beam of monochromatic light into two beams and make them interfere .",
    "thus , we can obtain a one dimensional standing wave along the interior bisector of the angle between two beams of lights , whose period depends on the angle between the two beams of lights .",
    "here , we present a general method to control any single qubit on one - dimensional finite lattice by using global hamiltonian @xmath29 .",
    "our idea for local manipulation derives from fourier transformation i.e. , any spatial function can be decomposed into a superposition of periodic eigen - functions .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional chain of @xmath40 qubits .",
    "the unitary evolution controlled by the effective periodic magnetic filed @xmath29 is : @xmath41 .",
    "our aim is to implement a delta function type of operation on the finite spin chain by assembling these wave - like unitary operations @xmath42 . without loss of generality",
    ", we consider performing a unitary operation @xmath43 on the @xmath44th site .",
    "the operation on a single site can be realized in an iterative way . in the iterative procedure ,",
    "a key step is to construct parity unitary operation : @xmath45 here , @xmath46 refers to the integer part of the number @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the parity unitary operation @xmath49 only remains homogeneous on even sites array from the @xmath44th site .",
    "it effectively just implements a homogeneous operation on a spin chain of @xmath50 qubits .",
    "we find that similar parity - eliminated operations can be established iteratively : @xmath51 @xmath52 finally , operation on the @xmath44th qubit can be realized : @xmath53 @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . in this iterative procedure ,",
    "implementing single qubit rotation takes @xmath55 elementary steps ( applications of @xmath56 ) , which roughly ranges from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "since single qubit operations can be realized , implementing two - qubit operation between two nearest neighbor qubits via many body interaction becomes feasible .",
    "we consider the case of ising model : @xmath59 .",
    "when the couplings between nearest neighbor qubits switch on , the corresponding unitary evolution is @xmath60 . to implement the interaction between the @xmath44th and @xmath61th qubits",
    "we may synthesize the following unitary transformations : @xmath62    in the above manipulation , a two - qubit operation takes 6 single qubit operations , so @xmath63 elementary steps ( applications of @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) are required .",
    "this overhead can be greatly reduced by devising a new focusing procedure , which is shown in fig .",
    "this focusing procedure is a bit similar to that of single qubit operation .",
    "the first iterative step is : @xmath66 here , the script @xmath44 refers to focusing the interaction between the @xmath44th and @xmath67th qubits .",
    "after the first step , almost two thirds couplings in this ising chain are cut off .",
    "then , we construct the iterative procedure : @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is determined by the following restrictions : @xmath70 & = & \\frac{2p+1}2\\pi ,   \\nonumber \\\\ a_n\\left [ \\cos \\left ( \\frac{3^n-1}{3^n}\\pi \\right ) -\\cos \\left ( \\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{3^n}\\pi \\right ) \\right ] & = & \\frac l2\\pi ,   \\label{eq4 } \\\\ a_n\\left [ 1-\\cos \\left ( \\frac{3^n-1}{3^n}\\pi \\right ) \\right ] & = & \\frac m2\\pi , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are arbitrary integers . obviously , for any given precision , we can always find an @xmath69 to satisfy eq .",
    "( 4 ) . finally , after repeating the iterative steps @xmath73 times , which corresponds to @xmath74 elementary steps , we obtain our anticipated operation : @xmath75 .      to prepare the qubit trapped in each lattice site to @xmath76",
    ", we drive the system to mott insulator regime with one atom occupancy per lattice site .",
    "furthermore , we adjust the interaction hamiltonian @xmath25 to ising type . when @xmath77 , ising type hamiltonian have twofold degenerate ground states @xmath78 and @xmath79 . by applying a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath80 @xmath81 ,",
    "the degeneracy of ground state will be broken .",
    "eventually , the system will relax to ground state @xmath82 if the environment is cold enough .",
    "to realize read out measurements for the final state of quantum computation , we may take advantage of auxiliary energy levels of the atoms ( see fig.1(c ) ) .",
    "our strategy is to transfer internal state @xmath83 to auxiliary energy level @xmath84 only for qubits localized in far apart sites , which can be achieved by using modified focusing operations .",
    "therefore , we may address and read out internal states @xmath84 in these lattice sites . compared with single qubit operation ,",
    "we replace periodic magnetic field @xmath85 \\sigma _ i^\\alpha $ ] with @xmath86 \\sigma _ { ki}^\\alpha $ ] , where @xmath87 is pauli operator in hilbert space spanned by @xmath88 ( we set @xmath89 ) .",
    "thus , we may map @xmath83 to @xmath90 for atoms in next nearest neighbor lattice sites after the first iterative step . using similar iterative procedure",
    ", we may transfer @xmath83 to @xmath91 only for atoms @xmath92 sites apart .",
    "for the internal state @xmath91 , we may address and read out by the method of detecting the fluorescence .",
    "since focusing any single qubit operation and ising interaction between any two nearest neighbor qubits can be realized , universal quantum computation can be implemented in one dimensional qubit array via global operations . in the described scheme ,",
    "a quantum computation on @xmath40 qubits roughly takes @xmath93 ( exactly less than @xmath58 ) elementary operations compared with addressable quantum computation schemes .",
    "although an exponentially increasing number of steps can be avoided , a linear dependence on the number of qubits is still a great obstacle for large - scale quantum computation due to the fragile many body coherence . to reduce the required resources further we may consider quantum computation in high dimensional periodic qubit arrays .    actually , focusing processes in high dimensional lattice are quite easy because they can be realized just by using one dimensional focusing methods , repetitively . here ,",
    "we just investigate quantum computation on two dimensional square lattice . in principle",
    ", higher dimensional quantum computation can be easily realized in a similar way .",
    "we set the number of sites in the row and column to @xmath94 , thus , the total number of sites in this lattice is @xmath95 . for simplicity",
    ", we denote the site of the @xmath6th row and @xmath96th column by @xmath97 .",
    "first , let us consider a single site on two dimensional lattice .",
    "without loss of generality , we give the unitary operation @xmath98 on site @xmath99 : @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in this process , only @xmath103 elementary steps are needed .",
    "next , we consider implementing ising interaction between sites @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "since focusing operation on a single site is attainable , a straightforward way to realize the operation @xmath106 is : @xmath107 @xmath108 here , @xmath109\\}$ ] . in this focusing procedure ,",
    "8 operations on single sites are required . to reduce the operational resources",
    ", we can also consider the simplified scheme .",
    "as shown by the above section , we can use the more efficient proposal to implement the interactions between the nearest neighbor sites in one dimension , i.e. to produce an operation @xmath110 via @xmath111 iterative steps .",
    "hence , we just need @xmath112 single site operations to achieve our goal : @xmath113 @xmath114    from the above proposal , we may find that the quantity of operations will be saved further for quantum computation in high dimensional qubits arrays .",
    "similar analysis will show that , compared with addressable quantum computation schemes , @xmath115 times numbers of operations are required for the scheme in a @xmath116-dimensional qubits array via global operations . here , @xmath40 refers to the total number of the qubits .",
    "then , we may make a rough comparison for local addressable and global addressable schemes from the viewpoint of the error of the unitary evolution .",
    "we set the single step average error rate @xmath117 for local operations and @xmath118 for global ones . for simplicity",
    ", we look on @xmath119 and @xmath118 as the upper bounds of two types of single step errors . as far as the scheme via global operations is concerned , an overhead of @xmath115 times numbers of operations is cost compared with addressable ones . while , ref@xcite shows that the upper bound of the error of the unitary evolution will linearly increase with the number of unitary transformations .",
    "therefore , if @xmath120 one can benifit from the scheme via global operations . while , in the above analysis , we do not differentiate the upper bounds for the different types of operations , which will lead to more subtle comparison for the overhead of operations in some well - known algorithms . a further analysis for the upper bound of the error is necessary and meaningful .",
    "in addition , an interesting question remains open : what is the best strategy for quantum computation via global operations ?",
    "once universal quantum computation can be implemented , any @xmath121 unitary transformation can be achieved .",
    "therefore , in principle , quantum computers have the ability to simulate dynamical behavior of any finite dimensional quantum systems .",
    "however , it is a formidable task to decompose the time - dependent unitary evolution under some non - trivial many body hamiltonians into a sequence of elementary quantum gate operations .",
    "fortunately , one can use trotter formula to approximately implement quantum simulation : @xmath122 but , it is still quite difficult for a standard quantum computer to simulate some highly correlated many body models . as an example , let us consider `` coupled dimer '' hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath123    here , @xmath124 links form decoupled dimers while @xmath125 links couple the dimers ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "@xmath126 is the dimensionless coupling coefficient . to simulate the unitary evolution @xmath127 of this 2-dimensional lattice with @xmath95 sites",
    ", it will take @xmath128 elementary logical gate operations , if we partition @xmath129 $ ] into",
    "@xmath130 identical intervals .",
    "however , the overhead can be avoided if we use global operations .",
    "we may decompose hamiltonian @xmath131 into two parts : @xmath132 , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath135 is the square lattice anti - ferromagnetic hamiltonian , which can be directly realized by adjusting the potential of the optical lattice .",
    "in addition , it is quite straightforward to implement unitary transformations @xmath136 and @xmath137 by using horizontal global operations and parity unitary operations . because @xmath138 commutes with @xmath139 ,",
    "unitary transformation @xmath140 can be achieved by concatenating @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "hence , more effective simulation for many body hamiltonian @xmath131 can be implemented by using global manipulation . by investigating this example",
    ", we find it is very convenient to use global manipulations to implement operations with periodic structures , although focusing processes on single or two sites will take many iterative steps .",
    "this suggests that quantum error - correction can be achieved by taking advantage of global manipulations .",
    "in addition , by adjusting the period and phase of the hamiltonian described by eq .",
    "( 3 ) we can implement the unitary operation @xmath143 .",
    "thus , an interval interaction form can be realized : @xmath144 .",
    "as shown by ref@xcite , if one can realize four types of hamiltonian : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 in one dimensional lattice , we can implement quantum computation via cellular - automata approach . here ,",
    "@xmath149 and @xmath150 refer to the uniform single qubit operation on even ( odd ) sites and the interaction between the even sites and its right ( left ) nearest neighbor sites , separately .",
    "in this paper , we have devised a scheme for universal quantum computation in the periodic lattice via global but periodic operations .",
