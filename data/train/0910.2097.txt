    "renormalization group ( rg ) , which is a powerful instrument for analyzing different strongly coupled systems @xcite(see also @xcite for more recent reviews ) , is usually based upon an appropriate division of the whole set of variables into two subsets : so called `` fast '' and `` slow '' variables with subsequent elimination of the fast ones .",
    "the resulting slow system is usually expected to behave essentially in the same way as the initial one but with coupling constants changed .",
    "successive application of this transformation results in a flow in the space of couplings . after each step of the rg transformation",
    "the information about exact values of fast variables is lost for the observer to whom only slow variables are available .",
    "it seems natural then to expect , that this information loss should lead to the irreversible character of the corresponding rg flow .",
    "this irreversibility is a subject of an intensive study for several decades now , starting from the famous work of zamolodchikov @xcite , who showed under certain assumptions that in two dimensions ( 2d ) there exists a function on a space of coupling constants ( a kind of lyapunov function ) which always decreases along the rg flow and at fixed points coincides with the central charge @xmath0 of corresponding conformal theories .",
    "`` irreversibility '' here means that the flow in the space of couplings resembles that of a simple dissipative system with a given trajectory never returning back to its starting point , thus excluding limit cycles or more complex strange attractors . in 2d theories the @xmath0-theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite states that the rg evolution is exactly of this type and looks like a simple monotonic flow downhill in the couplings space from fixed points with large @xmath0 to those with smaller values of the central charge .",
    "much work have been done in this direction and the @xmath0-theorem was studied in detail with its possible generalizations to higher dimensions ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein and also @xcite for quite recent development ) . still the interesting possibility that in general the flow may be more complicated , and may even exhibit chaotic behavior , like in case of many other nonlinear mappings , attracts some attention @xcite ( probably the first example of a chaotic rg flow was found for spin systems on hierarchical lattices @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the models where such peculiarities are observed are however rather artificial , so that the question whether they could take place in more realistic cases remains somewhat unclear .",
    "though this problem is rather complicated mathematically it looks much simpler from the physical point of view .",
    "the wilsonian rg transformation is designed in such a way that all finite dimensionless correlation lengths in a translationally invariant system always decrease @xcite .",
    "to say this another way , all masses ( measured in units of an ultra - violet cut - off ) grow and it seems quite natural that the effective number of massless modes , ( in 2d measured by the central charge @xmath0 ) can not increase .",
    "the argument based on the growth of masses , though not completely rigorous , is quite general , hence something unusual , like limit cycles in the flow , may be expected only in some special systems with only infinite correlation lengths or with infinite number of correlation lengths which can be arbitrarily large ( when we have e.g. a self - similar spectrum of masses converging to zero @xcite ) .",
    "but in systems with finite number of well defined correlation lengths the rg flow should probably always be irreversible .",
    "this argument however seems to be unrelated to the aforementioned information loss and information aspects probably play no role in the irreversibility , which may seem somewhat strange .",
    "probably the most known attempt to study rg irreversibility using information theory tools is the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite where the relative entropy was introduced in quantum field theory and some monotonicity theorems for it , as a function of relevant couplings , were proved and its relation to @xmath0-theorem was discussed .    in this paper",
    "we present a somewhat different , entirely information theory based approach to the problem of the rg flow , oriented more on discrete real space rg transformations in different lattice spin systems .",
    "clearly , information - theoretic considerations are too general to lead to some non - trivial concrete results , but still , as we shall see below they may impose some restrictions on the possible character of the flow .",
    "first , in section 2 we evaluate an exact amount of information loss for a single step of the renormalization as a kind of conditional entropy of fast variables ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "as one might expect , this information loss is equal to the decrease of entropy under the rg transformation .",
    "thus it is possible to establish a general theorem about the monotonic decrease of the total entropy ( and relative entropy as well ) under general coarse graining as a result of information loss .",
    "the monotonic decrease of entropy along the rg flow is neither something unusual ( see e.g. @xcite ) nor very interesting , because the entropy is proportional to the total number of degrees of freedom and should certainly decrease when some of them are integrated out .",
    "hence this monotonic behavior does not directly lead to the irreversibility of the flow .",
    "an interesting thing may happen however , if the entropy of a finite system possesses an additive size - independent part .",
    "if this part of the entropy also decreases , as the total entropy does , then it may provide the proper lyapunov function , because it does not explicitly depend on the number of variables and its change is entirely due to the flow of coupling constants .",
    "we will show that this takes place in 1d ising model , where this subextensive part of the entropy is known as the `` excess entropy '' and was studied in detail as a measure of statistical complexity of spatial structures @xcite .",
    "this excess entropy equals to the mutual entropy of two halves of the system which is actually the reason why it decreases under coarse graining .",
    "unfortunately we are unable to present a general theorem concerning the monotonicity of such excess entropy in higher dimensions .",
    "it appears possible though to prove quite a different monotonicity theorem , but only for a certain class of real space lattice rg transformations , namely for decimations , when exactly half of variables are eliminated on each step . the proof is based on the analysis of a new quantity introduced in section 3,mutual information of slow and fast variables .",
    "contrary to the information loss this mutual information shows how much information about eliminated fast variables is still present after a single step of the wilsonian renormalization .",
    "the nonnegativity of the mutual information may alone impose some restrictions on the character of the flow leading to its irreversibility .    for the decimations of the aforementioned type in lattice models we will show that the entropy per lattice site monotonically grows as a result of the positivity of the mutual information of spins on two identical sublattices , one of which is eliminated in the course of the rg transformation .",
    "therefore such decimation transformations , though they results in highly non - linear mappings , always lead to irreversible flows in the space of couplings .",
    "simple examples of such a behavior are discussed in section 4 , where one- and two - dimensional classical spin models and also the continuum limit gaussian model are considered .",
    "note , however , that the theorem holds true only for systems with real actions , when information theory can be applied , while e.g. it is not valid for the ising model with complex external magnetic field where the decimation rg flow is known to be chaotic @xcite .",
    "the theorem is also invalid for spin models on hierarchical lattices @xcite , because decimations are not associated there with decomposition of these finite and inhomogeneous lattices into two identical sublattices .",
    "the entropy per site growth may seem somewhat unexpected , because it takes place not only in the trivial case , when the flow goes to the high - temperature fixed point , but even when we start from points located in the ordered phase .",
    "rg trajectories that start from points below the phase transition can never end in the fully disordered trivial fixed point , since for decimation the mean magnetization is conserved along the flow , but nevertheless the entropy per site ( and hence the amount of disorder ) will always grow .",
    "this is a peculiar feature of the decimation and does not take place for other possible renormalization schemes , like e.g. the majority rule block spin transformation also discussed in section 4 .",
    "suppose that we somehow manage to divide our variables into `` fast '' @xmath1 and `` slow '' ones @xmath2 . for the wilsonian momentum space rg the fast variables are high fourier harmonics of the fields , but for real space renormalization in lattice systems @xmath1 s are just spins on some sublattice , so that they are not actually `` fast '' in any sense .",
    "still we will use these names to distinguish degrees of freedom to be integrated out and those that remain .",
    "the partition function is given by the sum over all fields , which symbolically may be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the action ( or energy divided by temperature for classical lattice systems ) .",
    "the fields normally depend on all space - time coordinates , so that the sums in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) are actually path integrals , properly regularized .",
    "now , the first step of the rg transformation is to integrate out the fast variables @xmath1 to obtain an effective action for the slow ones , @xmath5 , defined by @xmath6 this transformation is then repeated many times resulting in the rg flow of the corresponding actions ( or coupling constants if the form of the action is fixed ) .      certainly , after the fast variables are eliminated , information about their exact values is lost .",
    "one can ask then , what is the precise amount of the information loss . for a moment",
    "let us fix the slow variables @xmath2 , then the conditional probability for @xmath1 ( normalized to unity ) is @xmath7 it seems natural then to define the information ( measured in ` nats ' ) related to some field configuration @xmath1 in the fixed background @xmath2 by the usual shannon formula @xmath8 and the information loss after the fields @xmath1 are integrated out as an average of ( [ i ] ) over the distribution ( [ pcond ] ) @xmath9 this quantity still depends on the chosen configuration of the slow fields @xmath2 .",
    "actually @xmath10 is similar , in a sense , to the boltzmann entropy of a ` macrostate ' specified by the coarse - grained variables @xmath2 . indeed , in case of ` equipartition ' , when @xmath11 does not depend on @xmath1 in some domain of fast variables the information loss eq.([ia ] ) is just the logarithm of the number of ` microstates ' corresponding to a given macrostate .",
    "we propose then that the total information loss @xmath12 is an average of @xmath13 over all configurations of @xmath2 with the corresponding weight @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 this is obviously the _ conditional entropy _",
    "@xmath16 of two sets of random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 well known from the information theory @xcite .",
    "this is the average entropy of the fast variables given the state of the slow subsystem .",
    "the conditional entropy of this kind usually measures the amount of information loss in a noisy channel when @xmath1 is an input signal and @xmath2 is an output .",
    "one can also view the rg transformation as an action of a smoothing filter , then @xmath12 is the information loss due to smoothing .",
    "the conditional entropy as a measure of information loss also have been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite where a coarse graining of polymer configurations was considered .",
    "the above estimate of the information loss introduces a somewhat new paradigm of renormalization .",
    "we see now that it is possible to view the fast fields @xmath1 as an input signal , not directly available to a receiver , while the slow field @xmath2 is an output .",
    "after renormalization only the output signal is available and one can only try to restore the input signal more or less accurately .",
    "this is a typical situation of a signal transmission through a noisy channel where information loss may be estimated as a conditional entropy ( [ it ] ) . but",
    "this analogy suggests that it may probably be of more use to discuss not only the information loss but also the information that is preserved , i.e. information about fast variables that is stored in the action for the slow ones ( see section 3 ) .    substituting the probability distributions into eq .",
    "( [ it ] ) we easily obtain @xmath17 where the brackets @xmath18 mean the average over the fields with the corresponding actions ( clearly , for continuous theory some regularization is required for these formulas to make sense ) , the initial informational entropy @xmath19 of the distribution @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the entropy of the slow field @xmath23 is given by the same formula with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . recall that our rg transformation is defined in such a way that the partition function @xmath26 remains unchanged .",
    "also note that the new action @xmath27 , defined by ( [ eff ] ) , always contains an additive constant term , but it does not contribute to the entropy and may be ignored in the evaluation of @xmath28 .",
    "the shannon entropy @xmath19 used here is the entropy of the fluctuating fields and it measures in fact how large these fluctuations are . for a classical system @xmath19",
    "coincides with its thermodynamic entropy @xmath29 , but in quantum systems ( in the continuum limit ) they are different , because @xmath29 is related to fluctuations in occupation of energy levels and not to that of fields as functions of space - time coordinates .",
    "while @xmath19 is dominated by an ultra - violet divergent `` bulk '' contribution , proportional to the space - time volume , the quantum thermodynamic entropy @xmath29 looks , in a sense , as a finite - size correction to a leading term in @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , for example , for a 2d system on a large cylinder of length @xmath30 and circumference @xmath31 which may be viewed as a 1d quantum system at a temperature @xmath32 we have @xmath33 and the same is true for @xmath19 , but this bulk term obviously does not contribute to the thermodynamic entropy @xmath34 .",
    "hence non - zero @xmath29 arises only from finite size corrections to @xmath35 ( see section 4.5 for another example ) .",
    "thus the information loss @xmath12 is merely the difference of the initial entropy @xmath36 and the entropy of the remaining slow variables @xmath37 . for discrete variables",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath1 ( e.g. for classical spin systems ) both entropies and the conditional entropy are always nonnegative , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 and hence @xmath41 which means that the entropy of the remaining variables decreases along the rg flow .    at first glance",
    "this decrease of entropy may seem strange , since if the flow is e.g. directed toward the high temperature fixed point the system obviously gets more disordered after renormalization .",
    "recall , however , that it is the total entropy , an extensive quantity proportional to the system size , that decreases according to eq .",
    "( [ eg ] ) and this decrease is mainly due to the fact that the total number of variables is reduced after some of them are integrated out .",
    "for example , in large lattice systems @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of sites which decreases under real space rg transformation .",
    "the entropy per lattice site @xmath44 which is a more adequate measure of disorder may well increase along the rg flow .",
    "therefore the information loss @xmath12 is not very informative about the change in physics under renormalization and the monotonic decrease of @xmath19 does not in general give rise to a proper lyapunov function defined on the space of coupling constants .",
    "this is not very surprising because the total information loss is a rather crude characteristic of the rg transformation .",
    "an interesting possibility still remains , that some part of this information loss may provide the required monotonic function .",
    "the most natural choice probably would be some volume - independent additive part in @xmath19 for a finite system , something that may be called e.g. information about boundary conditions .",
    "an example of such a function will be explicitly presented in section 4.1 for the one - dimensional ising model .",
    "how to obtain possible extension of this result to higher dimensions is however not clear .    to conclude this subsection",
    "it should be mentioned , that for continuous field variables when we deal not with true probabilities but probability distributions and sums are replaced by integrals , direct application of the above formulas may lead to negative values of entropies @xcite and to negative @xmath12 which certainly is not acceptable . to avoid this one should either somehow make the variables @xmath2 , @xmath1 discrete ( `` digitize '' them ) or better use some other quantities , which do not suffer from such a drawback , like e.g.",
    "the _ relative entropy_.      relative entropy is the basic concept of the approach to renormalization developed in a series of papers @xcite . for the sake of completeness we present here a short discussion of its properties with regard to the wilsonian rg transformation .",
    "consider some statistical system with variables @xmath45 , and two probability distributions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "then we may introduce the relative entropy @xmath48 as the so called kullback - leibler distance ( divergence ) @xmath49 between these probability distributions @xmath50 this distance , though not symmetric , is nonnegative even for continuous @xmath45 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "now , the main idea of the approach @xcite is to consider probability distributions corresponding to two actions @xmath53 and @xmath54 which differ by the values of coupling constants , and to study the relative entropy @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and then choose @xmath58 to correspond to a rg fixed point distribution .",
    "thus physically this @xmath48 measures how far our system with the action @xmath53 is from a given fixed point .",
    "then we expect the relative entropy to behave monotonically under the change of the coupling constant , corresponding e.g. to some relevant perturbation of the fixed point .",
    "in fact , some rather general results are known about the behavior of @xmath48 under a coarse - graining .",
    "let us proceed as usual and decompose the whole set of fields @xmath45 into fast @xmath1 and slow ones @xmath2 . if we introduce conditional probability @xmath11 ( normalized to unity @xmath59 ) and",
    "make use of @xmath60 we can write the following chain of equalities @xmath61 the first term in the resulting expression is obviously the relative entropy after renormalization , @xmath62 , while the last term is known in information theory as a _ conditional relative entropy _ which is always nonnegative @xcite .",
    "hence we have @xmath63 this result , as well as the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ ca ] ) , is in fact widely known and usually referred to as a decrease of relative entropy under any kind of coarse - graining @xcite .",
    "the decrease of relative entropy for continuum gaussian model with lowering the ultra - violet cutoff @xcite is just one example of this general phenomenon .",
    "one can also view eq .",
    "( [ ca ] ) as a generalization of the expression ( [ i ] ) for the information loss .",
    "then the last term in eq .",
    "( [ ca ] ) may probably be called `` conditional information loss '' . since this is nonnegative also for continuous variables it looks more preferable for quantum field theory , than the information loss from the previous subsection .",
    "unfortunately inequality ( [ ha ] ) for the relative entropy is also not very useful because normally @xmath48 is an extensive quantity and its monotonic decrease again may be attributed to the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom ( effective shrinking of the system under renormalization ) and it is a specific quantity @xmath64 , where @xmath43 is e.g. a number of lattice sites , which is physically relevant .",
    "a more careful analysis shows however that @xmath48 is much better that entropy @xmath19 or similar quantities and possesses interesting monotonicity properties with respect to couplings ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "for example , close to a critical point with a diverging dimensionless correlation length @xmath65 the relative entropy taken with respect to the fixed point distribution in many cases behaves as @xmath66 ( for @xmath67-dimensional lattice system ) and is universal , depending not on the total number of variables , but only on the number of blocks of size @xmath65 .",
    "this means that relative entropy does not contain redundant `` low - level '' information . when this is true @xmath68 is obviously monotonic along the wilsonian rg flow , which is a particular example of how the informational `` distance '' grows on a trajectory moving away from the unstable fixed point .    if we take @xmath69 in ( [ ra ] ) to be a uniform distribution @xmath70 , then @xmath71 , where @xmath19 is the entropy of a given distribution @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , if the first term @xmath73 remains constant , the decrease of the relative entropy under a coarse - graining is usually related to the growth of the entropy @xmath19 @xcite . in our case",
    ", however , the first term also changes , because @xmath74 due to normalization condition for @xmath69 and therefore @xmath48 and @xmath19 both decrease .",
    "we now introduce another information - related quantity , the so called _ mutual information _ of the fast and slow variables , which seems to be free of the aforementioned drawbacks .",
    "we shall demonstrate now that the nonnegativity of this mutual information may itself impose some restriction on the rg flow .    to define this mutual information",
    ", we need to perform a transformation opposite , in a sense , to the usual rg transform of eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) , namely to integrate out the slow variables .",
    "this will result in an effective action @xmath75 for the fast variables @xmath1 , their probability distribution being @xmath76 , and the corresponding entropy will be denoted by @xmath77 .",
    "then the mutual information of two sets of variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 is defined as @xmath78\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the probability distribution for the initial system ( joint probability for @xmath2 and @xmath1 variables ) .",
    "the mutual information is certainly a kind of relative entropy which in our case measures the `` distance '' @xmath80 between the original system and some hypothetic one where fast and slow variables are independent , but described by their true corresponding effective actions , i.e. @xmath81 and @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ ra ] ) .    substituting expressions for probabilities in terms of actions one",
    "can easily derive the well known formulas from elementary information theory @xmath83-h(\\psi,\\eta)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath84 is the information loss after the normal rg transformation and @xmath85 is the information loss after elimination of the slow variables , or if we adopt the view that renormalization is the information transmission through the noisy channel @xmath86 , then @xmath85 is a measure of the noise @xcite .    in bipartite systems the mutual information is nonnegative and",
    "is known to measure the information about one subsystem stored in the other @xcite ( for independent subsystems @xmath87 ) , i.e. in our case it shows what amount of information about the fast fields @xmath1 is still contained in the effective action @xmath5 . since usually rg transformation results in the change of coupling constants it seems natural to think that the information about the eliminated fast variables is now hidden in the new values of these constants .",
    "therefore @xmath88 should be directly related to the rg flow of the coupling constants .",
    "note also that @xmath88 is represented in the last equation of eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) as a difference of two quantities with roughly the same size dependence , so that it should not be so sensitive to the reduction of degrees of freedom under the rg transformation .",
    "while in general @xmath88 is more difficult to calculate than the entropy , there exists an interesting situation when @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this happens e.g. for some decimation transformations in lattice systems , when the system is divided into two identical sub - lattices ( see next section ) and exactly half of variables ( those on one sub - lattice ) are integrated out . for large enough system with @xmath43 sites",
    "we may write @xmath91 and @xmath92 where @xmath44 and @xmath93 are the entropies per lattice site before and after the renormalization . then @xmath94 and hence the condition @xmath95 directly leads to the growth of the entropy per lattice site along the rg trajectory .",
    "this means that such decimations are always irreversible , but suggests that corresponding rg flows do not have fixed points for finite generic values of couplings .",
    "indeed , if there exists a fixed point then at this point @xmath96 and hence the bulk mutual information @xmath88 is zero .",
    "but this means that spins on two sub - lattices are essentially uncorrelated and remain uncorrelated under renormalization , which seems impossible for realistic spin systems with reasonable finite interactions .",
    "note , that this does not imply that decimation does not have nontrivial fixed points at all , but such fixed points ( apart from the trivial high - temperature one ) should probably lie at the `` boundary '' of the parameter space , when some couplings are set to infinity , as one can see e.g. in the classical spin-1 model on a line @xcite ( see also section 4.2 ) .    the absence of a nontrivial fixed point corresponding to the phase transition for pure decimation in 2d ising model have been noticed already in @xcite and was related to the fact that decimation does not eliminates only `` short range '' correlations but inevitably sums over some long - range behavior @xcite , i.e. it is actually not a good rg transformation .",
    "let us now take a look at some simple examples .",
    "the classical one - dimensional ferromagnetic ising model is the most known example of the rg transformation which here can be performed exactly .",
    "the model is defined on a lattice with @xmath43 sites and the initial action is given by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 . the real space rg procedure ( decimation )",
    "is defined as follows : we decompose the lattice into two sub - lattices and sum over spins on one sublattice @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the resulting model is again of the ising type with @xmath99 , with twice the initial lattice spacing and @xmath100 sites .",
    "the entropy @xmath19 is here the true entropy of the ising model and the information loss , defined by eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) , is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the entropy per lattice site @xmath103 and @xmath104 the rg flow is very simple since the running coupling constant @xmath105 flows from the zero temperature fixed point @xmath106 to the high temperature one at @xmath107 .",
    "though @xmath108 decreases during the rg procedure and @xmath109 it is easy to verify that @xmath12 is always positive , has its maximum @xmath110 at @xmath107 and then monotonically decreases to zero as @xmath111 .",
    "it is interesting that for large @xmath112 the information loss can be obtained independently , so that eq .",
    "( [ ii ] ) can be used to derive @xmath108 . indeed , if @xmath113 most probable spin configurations are that of well separated kinks ( domain walls ) .",
    "if a spin , which is eliminated , falls inside a domain , no information is lost , because its value does not fluctuate at large @xmath105 and is completely determined by adjacent spins . but a spin that lies on a domain wall is completely unconstrained and hence the information loss is @xmath114 .",
    "since there are on the average @xmath115 kinks at @xmath111 we conclude that @xmath116 where dots indicate terms of higher order in @xmath117 . at large @xmath105 the leading term in entropy",
    "is @xmath118 hence eq . ( [ ii ] ) results in @xmath119 which has the solution @xmath120 this is the correct expression for the renormalized coupling at @xmath111 and we see now that @xmath114 here is in fact of informational origin .",
    "now we discuss the relative entropy eq .",
    "( [ ra ] ) of the ising model at some coupling @xmath121 taken with respect to the state at a different coupling @xmath122 . the general formula , derived in @xcite states that @xmath123 where @xmath124 in our case @xmath125 and",
    "hence @xmath126 we can look now at some limiting cases .",
    "first consider the entropy relative to the high temperature fixed point @xmath127 . then @xmath128 one can easily see that @xmath48 decreases under the rg transformation when @xmath99 and @xmath129 and @xmath64 also tends to zero .",
    "the entropy relative to the zero temperature fixed point should be obtained in the limit @xmath130 but the limiting expression diverges .",
    "fortunately , we can take @xmath131 which is almost the same for our purposes .",
    "then @xmath132.\\ ] ] again the total relative entropy monotonically decreases along the rg flow as the general proof suggests , but now @xmath133 increases from zero to @xmath134 .",
    "close to the critical point @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the correlation length .",
    "thus , in this limit @xmath48 is not changed by the rg transformation @xmath137 , @xmath129 and actually measures the number of blocks of size @xmath65 as the general analysis suggests @xcite .",
    "this example clearly illustrates that @xmath48 always decreases , but this behavior is in part due to the effective shrinking of the system @xmath129 and implies only that @xmath138 .",
    "the relative entropy per lattice site @xmath133 is more useful because it really measures the `` distance '' from the fixed points and its evolution is related to the direction of the flow . since here",
    "the rg flow is from the zero temperature fixed point to the high temperature one , @xmath139 decreases while @xmath140 monotonically grows ( as @xmath141 close to the critical point ) .",
    "it is easy also to calculate the mutual information @xmath88 for this model . since the two sublattices are identical and similar to the original one , @xmath142 and hence @xmath143\\ ] ] we see then , that indeed @xmath88 , as expected , is determined entirely by the change of the coupling constant and from @xmath95 it follows that @xmath144 i.e. the entropy per site @xmath102 always grows along the rg trajectory .",
    "this is rather trivial for the model in question since the rg flow leads us to the disordered fixed point @xmath107 with maximum entropy regardless of the initial state because there is no phase transition .",
    "nevertheless this simple example clearly shows how the irreversibility of the rg flow can be derived within the informational approach .",
    "so far we have considered only the thermodynamic limit @xmath145 .",
    "let us now take a more careful look at the finite system .",
    "the partition function for finite block of ising spins is well known @xmath146 . from this expression",
    "it is easy to obtain the entropy and its expansion in powers of @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath44 is given by eq .",

    "hence we conclude that in this case the entropy per site should also increase in the course of the rg transformation and the rg flow is irreversible .",
    "the entropy growth in two dimensions may seem a rather counterintuitive result , since in systems with phase transition one may navely expect that at low temperatures ( below the transition ) the rg transformation should lead us deeply into the ordered phase with @xmath208 decreasing to zero .",

    "surely this picture may also be interpreted as a decrease in the correlation length for spin fluctuations .",

    "the effective action @xmath27 now contains renormalized mass @xmath297 , frequency @xmath298 and a new lattice spacing @xmath299 , but the measure ( [ sum ] ) remains the same .",
    "this means that in this case _ the entropy after renormalization is no longer given by the same formula ( [ ha ] ) as before_.    we may transform the measure to the correct form but this leads to an additional factor @xmath300 in @xmath26 , since the lattice now has @xmath100 sites .",

    "it is now easy to verify that in the vicinity of @xmath322 the initial value of the entropy is @xmath327 and that it indeed acquires an additional @xmath328 contribution at each decimation step provided we are still close to the fixed point .",
    "note that @xmath44 grows even for @xmath322 because in the two dimensional space of @xmath105 and @xmath311 there is no critical fixed point and the point @xmath322 corresponds to a line @xmath329 with the rg flow along it .",
    "after many decimations @xmath330 , i.e. @xmath105 decreases much faster than @xmath311 and the entropy starts to behave as @xmath331 with logarithmic accuracy .",
    "since @xmath332 means the loss of correlations between @xmath295 s on different sites , this expression for the entropy @xmath44 is in fact the entropy production rate for the gaussian white noise @xmath333 with dispersion @xmath334 , well known in the information theory .",
    "in this paper we have tried to understand what limitations on the rg flow may follow from the information theory , because wilsonian rg transformation , when some fast variables are integrated out , is obviously related to the information loss .",
    "this transformation is similar in a sense to a signal transmission through a noisy channel , the fast variables being the input , while the slow ones play the role of the output available to a receiver .",
    "the information loss is defined here as an average conditional entropy of the eliminated fast variables when the remaining slow variables are fixed . from the nonnegativity of this quantity (",
    "which holds at least for systems with discrete variables , like e.g. classical spins ) it follows immediately that the informational entropy @xmath19 of the system can not increase under renormalization .",
    "unfortunately this result is not very interesting , and does not lead to the irreversibility of the rg flow , because it applies to the total extensive entropy , proportional to the size of the system , which effectively shrinks after renormalization .",
    "this shrinking is evident for real space rg schemes , where some lattice sites are eliminated and the system size is smaller if measured in new lattice constant , but equally applies to momentum space wilsonian renormalization due to final rescaling of momenta .",
    "only if @xmath19 possesses some volume independent additive part @xmath150 , then this part , if it also decreases under renormalization , may provide the required lyapunov function , that depends only on couplings .",
    "physically its decrease may be attributed to a loss of information about massless modes , but this does not follow directly from that of @xmath19 and should be deduced independently . then , to be monotonous @xmath150 must have also some independent definition . for 1d ising model",
    "this quantity is just the subextensive excess entropy and we explicitly check its monotonicity under rg transformation .",
    "this behavior for a finite block of spins in an infinite chain follows directly from information theory , because excess entropy in this case is just the mutual information of two halves of the system @xcite , which decreases under coarse graining .",
    "note also that for 1d systems with periodic boundary conditions the excess entropy is @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the degeneracy of the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix which always decreases along the rg flow .",
    "this is somewhat similar to what is known for critical 2d systems defined on a long cylinder of size @xmath335 with , say , @xmath336 and periodic boundary condition in the @xmath295 direction . in this case",
    "the first finite size correction in the expansion of entropy in @xmath337 is @xmath338 ) @xcite , where @xmath0 is the central charge .",
    "therefore the subextensive part @xmath150 in entropy in 2d should decrease as a consequence of the @xmath0-theorem .",
    "however in both these examples the subleading term in entropy is discontinuous and does not directly lead to a proper lyapunov function .",
    "this means that the extraction of the required part from the entropy of finite size system is somewhat ambiguous and depends on the boundary condition .",
    "one may suggest , however , that in general there might exist some size - independent information - based quantity defined on the whole space of couplings ( maybe some kind of relative entropy or higher order mutual information @xcite ) that is monotonic along the flow and at fixed points coincides with some kind of excess entropy , but this point is not clear .",
    "the main aim of the present paper was , however , apart from demonstrating some examples of informational approach , to introduce a different quantity , namely the mutual information of fast and slow variables @xmath88 , which shows how much information about the eliminated variables is still stored in the renormalized effective action .",
    "this quantity does not suffer from the `` shrinking size '' trouble and is less sensitive to the overall decrease in the number of degrees of freedom , though it is generally more difficult to evaluate .",
    "there exist however some real space decimation transformations for which this mutual information can be easily calculated .",
    "this happens e.g. if the original lattice may be decomposed in two identical sublattices and rg transformation eliminates spins on one sublattice .",
    "then the nonnegativity of @xmath88 results in the increase of entropy per lattice cite and rg flow resembles a relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "this result does not depend on interactions and may be true also for a larger set of models .",
    "what is actually needed is that the rg transformation must be represented as a product of such decimations .",
    "the approach to irreversibility based on the mutual information is different from those trying to generalize zamolodchikov s @xmath0-theorem and possibly may provide some additional information about the rg flows .",

    "<S> we present a possible approach to the study of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow based entirely on the information theory . </S>",
    "<S> the average information loss under a single step of wilsonian rg transformation is evaluated as a conditional entropy of the fast variables , which are integrated out , when the slow ones are held fixed . </S>",
    "<S> its positivity results in the monotonic decrease of the informational entropy under renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , does not necessarily imply the irreversibility of the rg flow , because entropy is an extensive quantity and explicitly depends on the total number of degrees of freedom , which is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> only some size - independent additive part of the entropy could possibly provide the required lyapunov function . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce a mutual information of fast and slow variables as probably a more adequate quantity to represent the changes in the system under renormalization and evaluate it for some simple systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that for certain real space decimation transformations the positivity of the mutual information directly leads to the monotonic growth of the entropy per lattice site along the rg flow and hence to its irreversibility . </S>"
