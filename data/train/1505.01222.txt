    "_ _ two - way communication is one of the most common modes of operation for wireless links , particularly for cellular and device - to - device ( d2d ) systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . the conventional approach to the design of a system comprising multiple interfering two - way links",
    "consists of two separate phases : at first , one fixes a transmission direction independently for each link ; and , then , the physical - layer parameters , such as powers or beamforming vectors , are optimized in a centralized or decentralized fashion so as to maximize some system - wide performance criterion .",
    "this is , for instance , the standard approach for cellular systems , in which the scheduling of uplink and/or downlink transmissions is performed on a per - cell basis as a preliminary step . _",
    "_    _ _ the emerging technique of dynamic time division duplex ( tdd ) breaks with the conventional approach discussed above in that the switching points between uplink and downlink transmissions in a frame are optimized jointly across all cells based on the current channel conditions _ _ _ _ @xcite@xcite . _",
    "_ the key motivation for this paradigm change is the observation that the selection of the duration of the uplink and downlink transmission phases in a cell can have a significant impact on the interference observed by the interfered cells . _ _    _ _ with dynamic tdd , the ordering of the transmissions in the two directions of a two - way link is fixed .",
    "however , the interference configuration depends significantly on such scheduling decisions .",
    "an illustration of bi - directional scheduling is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for two links : in each frame comprising two slots of fixed duration , each link can operate in the left ( @xmath0 ) to right ( @xmath1 ) direction , i.e. , @xmath2 , in the first slot and then in the opposite direction , @xmath3 , in the second slot , or it can schedule first the @xmath3 direction and then the @xmath2 direction . as in @xcite , we refer to this binary choice for each link as the _ _ _ interference spin _ _ _ of the link . _ _    a network of two - way mimo communication links .",
    "examples include uplink - downlink cellular links and two - way d2d channels . ]",
    "_ _ reference @xcite studies the optimization of bi - directional scheduling in the presence of fixed switching times for single - antenna links . in this work , instead , we investigate the interplay of multi - antenna transmission and reception with bi - directional scheduling for fixed switching times and a general mimo two - way multi - link system . _ _ this study is motivated by the observation that the choice of the interference spins across the network defines the channel matrices of the interfering channels on which the linear transceivers operate .",
    "therefore , the capability of multiple antennas to mitigate interference depends on the scheduling decisions in a fundamental way .",
    "algorithms are proposed that perform either the separate or the joint optimization of the interference spins and of the linear transceivers , with the aim of minimizing the interference leakage power and hence obtaining enhanced interference alignment solutions in the sense of @xcite .",
