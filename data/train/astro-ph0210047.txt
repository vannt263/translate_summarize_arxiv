    "identification of the classes of objects responsible for the cosmic x - ray background radiation ( xrb ) has been one of the fundamental pursuits of x - ray astronomy for the past several decades .",
    "it now appears that different populations produce the majority of the background in different x - ray energy bands . in the soft 0.52 kev range , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with broad optical emission lines ( i.e. , seyfert  1 galaxies and quasars ) are the dominant contributors to the xrb ( schmidt et al .",
    "these objects , however , have steep x - ray spectra and can not explain the flat slope of the xrb spectrum at higher energies .",
    "type  2 ( narrow - line ) seyfert galaxies have thus emerged as the most promising candidates for the origin of the hard ( 210 kev ) xrb .",
    "the soft x - ray fluxes of these objects are heavily absorbed by dense circumnuclear gas , presumably the same material that obscures their broad emission - line regions .",
    "models ( madau , ghisellini , & fabian 1994 ; comastri et al .",
    "1995 ; gilli , salvati , & hasinger 2001 ) and x - ray observations of nearby sources ( moran et al .",
    "2001 ) have demonstrated that seyfert  2 galaxies have both the space density and x - ray spectral properties necessary to account for the intensity and spectrum of the hard xrb .    the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , which resolves the majority of the xrb in deep exposures , provides an opportunity to confirm the seyfert  2 hypothesis directly .",
    "surprisingly , however , follow - up optical observations of faint sources in the deepest _ chandra _ images have revealed a significant population of apparently _ normal _ galaxies and far fewer seyfert 2s than expected ( e.g. , mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ; barger et al .  2001a , 2001b , 2002 ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "`` normal '' galaxies represent @xmath0 4060% of the hard x - ray sources classified in deep surveys ; many exhibit evidence of absorption in the x - ray band , but emission lines are very weak in their starlight - dominated optical spectra .",
    "the multiwavelength properties of the prototypical example of this class are described by comastri et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "the prevailing interpretation is that optically normal , x - ray  luminous galaxies are common at modest redshifts , perhaps reflecting a tendency for agns in the past to be more absorbed or have weaker ionizing continua than present - day seyfert galaxies ( barger et al .",
    "this hints at the possibility that the x - ray galaxy population has evolved with cosmic  time .",
    "alternatively , we propose that the results of the deep _ chandra _ surveys may be heavily influenced by the limitations of ground - based observing . in spectroscopic observations of nearby agns , light is collected through a small aperture centered on the nucleus , which excludes most of the starlight from the host galaxy .",
    "the faint sources that produce the hard xrb , in contrast , are very distant ( the majority are at redshifts @xmath1 ) ; thus , when they are observed , the entire galaxy ( or a large fraction of it ) falls within the spectrograph slit .",
    "( at @xmath2 , 10 kpc corresponds to @xmath0  15 . )",
    "combined with the low spectral resolution that has been employed to date ( @xmath0 1220  ) and the modest signal - to - noise ratios frequently obtained ( the optical counterparts are generally quite faint ) , the additional galaxy light ( from stars and  regions ) could lead to the appearance that some distant _ chandra _ sources are associated with normal galaxies rather than with seyfert  2s .    to investigate this possibility",
    "we have obtained _ integrated _ spectra of nearby seyfert  2 galaxies that are known to be absorbed x - ray sources .",
    "our techniques simulate ground - based spectroscopic observations of distant x - ray galaxies , allowing us to evaluate whether the emission - line signatures of their activity can be overwhelmed ( or `` hidden '' ) in spectra of their integrated light .",
    "this project draws inspiration from a series of papers by kennicutt ( 1992a , 1992b ) , who obtained integrated spectra of nearby galaxies of all types to assist `` the classification of unresolved galaxies at large distances [ and ] the spectroscopic identification of extended sources detected in infrared , radio , and x - ray surveys '' ( kennicutt 1992a ) .",
    "our similarly motivated work focuses on the class of objects believed to be responsible for the hard x - ray background .",
    "the objects for this study are drawn from the distance - limited sample of seyfert galaxies compiled by ulvestad & wilson ( 1989 ) .",
    "there are 31 confirmed seyfert  2s in the sample ( moran et al .",
    "2000 ) , almost all of which have been observed in the 110 kev band with the _ asca _ satellite ( moran et al .",
    "the ulvestad & wilson sample is ideal for this project for several reasons .",
    "first , because of its distance - limited nature , the sample is relatively unbiased .",
    "second , the hard x - ray luminosities of the objects ( @xmath0  @xmath3@xmath4 ergs  s@xmath5 ) are comparable to those of the `` normal '' galaxies in deep _",
    "chandra _ surveys ( barger et al .  2001a , 2001b ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "2001 ) . and",
    "finally , because all of the objects are located within @xmath0  60  mpc , most are close enough that we can isolate the emission from their nuclei yet distant enough ( i.e. , with sufficiently small angular diameters ) that we can measure their integrated spectra with relative ease .",
    "our data were acquired with the 3-m shane reflector at lick observatory over the course of three runs in august and november 2001 and february 2002 .",
    "we employed 600 line mm@xmath5 dispersing elements on each arm of the kast double spectrograph ( miller & stone 1993 ) , which provided coverage of the 34008100   range . for each galaxy",
    ", we obtained a 300  s exposure of the nucleus using a @xmath6 slit oriented at the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "the nuclear spectra represent @xmath7@xmath8 extractions along the slit and have a resolution of 56    ( fwhm ) .",
    "integrated spectra of each object were obtained by scanning an east - west slit across the galaxy in declination at a constant rate .",
    "six scans were obtained for most galaxies , although a few of the brighter objects were scanned three to five times . for the scans ,",
    "the width of the slit was increased to @xmath9 to improve our observing efficiency and to degrade the spectral resolution to 1516   , comparable to that used in observations of faint _",
    "chandra _ sources ( barger et al .",
    "2002 ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "the angular distances of the scans ( @xmath10@xmath11 in declination ) were dictated by the diameters of the galaxies in high - contrast images from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "each scan had a duration of 600  s ; combined with the slit width and scan distances , this yielded effective exposures of 30  s to 120  s per scan for each object s integrated spectrum .",
    "these spectra include most of the light from each galaxy above the sky background ( i.e. , @xmath12 to @xmath13 extractions ) .",
    "we observed a total of 18 objects from our sample  all those at @xmath14 with projected angular sizes in right ascension ( again , estimated from dss images ) of less than @xmath15 .",
    "the latter restriction ensured that we would be able to perform accurate sky background subtraction with light that entered the slit near the two ends .",
    "the galaxies observed and some pertinent data are listed in table  1 .",
    "the optical and x - ray properties of the 13 objects we did not observe do not differ significantly .",
    "recently published spectroscopic studies of faint _",
    "chandra _ sources are based mainly on data acquired with 810  m telescopes ( barger et al .",
    "2002 ; hornschemeier et al .  2001 ; tozzi et al .",
    "2001 ) . in most respects ,",
    "the integrated spectra we have obtained accurately simulate observations of distant type  2 agns with these instruments .",
    "the scan distances and extractions employed for our sample include most of the light from the galaxies ; they correspond to physical sizes of @xmath0 820 kpc , similar to that which is typically included within a 1.5@xmath6 slit for a distant _ chandra _ source .",
    "our spectral resolution , as discussed above , is comparable to that used in _",
    "chandra _ source surveys .",
    "in addition , the effective exposure times associated with our scans are equivalent to 1.52  hr keck exposures of objects @xmath0 78 mag fainter , i.e. , objects with visual magnitudes in the @xmath16 2022 range .",
    "these roughly correspond to the keck exposure times and magnitudes of distant _ chandra _ sources that have been classified spectroscopically ( barger et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b , 2002 ) .    examples of our results are displayed in figure  1 .",
    "the nuclear spectrum of ngc 262 (= mrk 348 ; lower trace of fig .",
    "1a ) bears all the characteristics of a type  2 seyfert galaxy : strong [ ]  @xmath17 , [ ]  @xmath18 , h@xmath19  @xmath20 , [ ]  @xmath21 , [ ]  @xmath22 , h@xmath23  @xmath24 , [ ]  @xmath25 , and [ ]  @xmath26 emission lines with high [ ] /h@xmath19 , [ ] /h@xmath23 , [ ] /h@xmath23 , and [ ] /h@xmath23  flux ratios ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "these same features are clearly present in the integrated spectrum of the galaxy ( upper trace of fig .",
    "1a ) , despite the presence of a significant amount of additional starlight .",
    "thus , ngc  262 retains its seyfert  2 classification in the integrated spectrum .",
    "the spectra in figures 1b  e tell a much different story .",
    "once again , the nuclear spectra of these galaxies exhibit seyfert  2 emission - line signatures . in the integrated spectra , however , the lines are far less prominent , and some are completely obliterated .",
    "the strongest spectral features are the  @xmath27 , g band ( @xmath28 ) ,  @xmath29  @xmath30 , and na  i d @xmath31 stellar absorption lines typically observed in the spectra of normal early - type galaxies .",
    "note that the [ ]  @xmath18 emission line , which has been used in _",
    "chandra _ source surveys to identify agns ( barger et al .  2001a , 2001b ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "2001 ) , is not visible in the integrated spectra .",
    "thus , [ ]  emission can not be relied upon to indicate the presence of an active nucleus .    the data for ngc  3982 ( fig .",
    "1f ) provide an interesting third alternative .",
    "although the emission lines in both the nuclear and integrated spectra of this object are strong , the line - flux ratios in the two differ dramatically .",
    "for example , in the nuclear spectrum , [ ]  @xmath25/h@xmath23  @xmath32 1 and [ ]  @xmath33/h@xmath19  @xmath32 16 , which is typical for a seyfert  2 . in the integrated spectrum , however",
    ", [ ] /h@xmath23  = 0.37 and [ ] /h@xmath19  = 0.82 , consistent with the values observed in  regions ( e.g. , veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) . the [ ] /h@xmath23  and [ ] /h@xmath23  ratios also resemble those of  regions . given only the integrated spectrum of ngc 3982 , we would classify it as a starburst galaxy rather than a type  2 seyfert !",
    "we obtain a similar result for another object in our sample , ngc 1667 .",
    "thus , it is possible for the emission from star - forming regions to drown out an active nucleus in a galaxy , which sheds light on the nature of the `` composite '' starburst / seyfert galaxies uncovered during optical surveys of _ rosat _ sources ( moran , halpern , & helfand 1996 ) .",
    "the last column of table 1 indicates our assessment of the classifications of our galaxies based on their integrated spectra .",
    "while seven objects with strong lines in the nucleus remain as seyfert  2s in the integrated spectra , 11 others ( or @xmath0  60% ) would _ not _ be classified as agns .",
    "this is comparable to the fraction of _ chandra _ sources ( @xmath0  4060% ) identified with `` normal '' galaxies in deep surveys ( barger et al .  2001a , 2001b , 2002 ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "2001 ) . among the normal - looking subset of our sample ,",
    "nine objects resemble early - type galaxies with red continua and strong absorption features , and two objects have spectra reminiscent of starburst ( or post - starburst ) galaxies .",
    "all of the objects we observed display some evidence of emission lines in their integrated spectra . while the same is true of all of the `` normal '' galaxies whose spectra are presented by barger et al .",
    "( 2001a , 2001b ) and hornschemeier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , 19% of the sources classified by barger et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are described as `` absorption - line '' galaxies .",
    "some of these objects may in fact have faint emission lines  weak [ ]  and [ ] emission is visible in the average absorption - line galaxy spectrum shown in figure  5h of barger et al .  (",
    "others , however , may be devoid of emission features in the data obtained .",
    "two factors are likely to contribute to the relatively high incidence of absorption - line systems in the _ chandra _ surveys :    \\(1 ) the h@xmath23  and [ ]  emission lines can be the strongest lines in the spectra of seyfert galaxies ; as such , they are vital for accurate spectroscopic classifications .",
    "in fact , the classifications of two of the persistent seyfert  2s in our sample ( mrk  1066 and mcg @xmath3401 - 27 - 020 ) would be ambiguous without information about the lines near h@xmath23 . however , @xmath0  70% of the spectra of supposedly normal galaxies published by barger et al .  and hornschemeier et al .",
    "do not cover the h@xmath23  region because of the high redshifts of the objects .",
    "it is possible that some of the absorption - line galaxies would exhibit emission lines if this region were observed .",
    "\\(2 ) our relatively small sample of nearby objects does not include all possible types of host galaxies .",
    "in particular , galaxies with high optical luminosities are absent . using the expression given in",
    "  12.5 of barger et al .  ( 2002 ) and the information listed in table  1 , we find that 14 ( 78% ) of the objects we observed have @xmath35-band luminosities below @xmath4 ergs  s@xmath5 , and all have @xmath36 ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the majority of the sources spectroscopically classified by barger et al .",
    "have @xmath37 in excess of @xmath4 ergs  s@xmath5 . compared to the objects in our sample , the integrated light of these high-@xmath37 galaxies could more easily overwhelm the emission from moderately luminous seyfert nulcei .",
    "host - galaxy luminosity may also be related to the detection of optically dull , x - ray ",
    "bright objects at fairly low redshifts ( @xmath38 ; see comastri et al .",
    "the possibility that some host - galaxy light is excluded in the spectra of these objects is probably offset by the fact that their host galaxies are quite luminous  nine of the ten `` normal '' galaxies in the comastri et al .",
    "( 2002b ) study have @xmath37 greater than a few times @xmath4 ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "thus , as we have speculated previously ( moran et al .",
    "2001 ) , it _ is _ possible to `` hide '' the true nature of classical type  2 agns in their integrated optical spectra .",
    "low signal - to - noise ratio and inadequate spectral coverage due to redshift effects can hinder the classification process further .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the demographics of the distant x - ray galaxy population under investigation in deep _",
    "surveys are more likely to be influenced by the limitations of ground - based spectroscopic observations than by some evolution of the population .",
    "the majority of the apparently normal galaxies that have turned up in these surveys , at least those with flat ( presumably absorbed ) x - ray spectra and/or substantial x - ray luminosities , would probably have optical spectra similar to those of nearby seyfert  2s if their nuclei could be isolated spatially .",
    "if so , this would verify that seyfert  2 galaxies are the dominant contributors to the hard xrb , as prior research has suggested .",
    "host galaxy dilution is likely to impact any ground - based spectroscopic survey of distant galaxies , leading to underestimates of the numbers of narrow - line agns in such surveys .",
    "we would like to express our thanks to bill holzapfel for generously donating the august 2001 lick time that enabled us to get this project underway .",
