    "significant research interest in this frontier of optomechanics is motivated by its potential applications in ultrasensitive measurements , quantum information processing , and implementation of novel quantum phenomena at macroscopic scales @xcite .",
    "recently , a phenomenon resembling electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite in atomic physics , called optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) , is predicted theoretically @xcite and observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "omit can be used for slowing and switching probe signals @xcite and may be further used for on - chip storage of light pulses via microfabricated optomechanical arrays @xcite .",
    "omit in the nonlinear quantum regime has also been investigated @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "optomechanically induced absorption ( omia ) phenomenon , which is an analog of electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) investigated in atomic gas @xcite and superconducting artificial atoms @xcite , can also be realized in optomechanical setup @xcite .",
    "and omia is a phenomenon closely related to optomechanically induced amplification @xcite .",

    "the control laser with amplitude @xmath1 resonantly couples the transition @xmath2 , the probe laser with amplitude @xmath3 and detuning @xmath4 couples the transition @xmath5 , the auxiliary driving field with amplitude @xmath6 and detuning @xmath4 couples the transition @xmath7.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to abtain optomechanical analogs of atomic coherence related phenomena such as eit and eia , the key point is that a mechanical coherence ( similar to atomic coherence ) must be induced .",
    "specifically , in standard omit @xcite and omia @xcite , this coherent oscillation of the mechanical resonator results from a time varying radiation pressure force induced by the beat of the probe and the control laser . the oscillating mechanical resonator together with ( red-/blue - detuned ) control field can further induce sidebands on the cavity field . the generated field with probe frequency",
    "can interfer with the original probe field , leading to omit / omia absorption spectra .",
    "in fact , this type of mechanical coherence can also be generated by directly driving the mechanical resonator .",
    "thus , in this paper , we consider that in an optomechanical system , besides a red - detuned control field and a nearly resonant probe field applied to pump the optical cavity , an additional weak driving field is used to directly excite the mechanical resonator . in this case , the optomechnical cavity can be resonantly exited by directly absorbing a probe photon , or through phonon - photon process . for the interference effects of these two possible transition paths ,",
    "the optical response properties for the probe field become phase - sensitive , and more complex quantum interference and quantum coherence related phenomena will appear .",
    "specifically , gain without inversion ( gwi ) like , omia and eit - type spectra can be abtained , depending on the amplitude and phase of the control field .",
    "in addition , by adjusting the control field and the additional driving field applied on the mechanical resonator , the probe field can be efficiently manipulated from perfect absorption to remarkable amplification .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ p2 ] , we introduce theoretical model for describing the driven optomechanical system . then , in sec .",
    "[ p3 ] , we study the phase - dependent optical response for the probe field in detail , including gwi - like spectra in sec .",

    "[ b ] , amplification and perfect absorption in sec .",
    "[ c ] , and numerical simulation in sec .",
    "[ d ] . finally , further discussions and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we consider a standard optomechanical system schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ om system](a ) .",
    "the cavity is driven by a strong control laser and a weak probe one , where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the control ( probe ) laser frequency and amplitude , respectively . meanwhile , a weak coherent driving field with frequency @xmath12 and amplitude @xmath13 is applied to excite the mechanical resonator .",
    "experimentally , a micro / nano scale mechanical resonator can be , for example , driven by microwave electrical signals through the piezoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the frequencies of the three coherent driving fields satisfy the condition @xmath14 .",
    "[ om system](b ) shows a block of three energy levels in the system .",
    "clearly , the three couplings create a set of @xmath15-type transitions analogous to those in superconducting artificial atoms @xcite , chiral molecules @xcite , or microwave - driving natural atoms @xcite .",
    "thus one can expect that , similar to these quantum systems with closed - loop transition structure , the optical properties of the optomechanical system considered here will be sensitive to the relative phases of three applied fields .    in a frame rotating at the frequency of the coupling field @xmath16",
    ", the hanmiltonian of the system is of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the photon ( phonon ) annihilation operator , @xmath20 is the mechanical resonance frequency , @xmath21 is the detuning of the control laser from the bare cavity frequency @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the single - photon coupling strength of the radiation pressure between the cavity field and the mechanical resonator , and @xmath24 describes the interaction between the optomechanical system and the three driving fields : @xmath25 the nonlinear quantum langevin equations for the operators of the optical and mechanical modes are given by @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the decay rates of cavity and mechanical resonator , respectively . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the quantum and thermal noise operators , respectively .",
    "we assume that they satisfy the condition @xmath31 .",
    "it is not easy to obtain the solutions of the nonlinear equations and .",
    "however , we are only interested in the linear response of the driven optomechanical system to weak probe field .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath32 , we can linearize the dynamical equations of the driven optomechanical system by assuming @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are steady - state values of the system when only strong driving field is applied .",
    "they can be gotten from eqs .   and",
    "by assuming @xmath37 and all time derivatives vanish : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the effective detuning between the cavity field and the control field , including the frequency shift caused by the mechanical motion . after plugging the ansatz @xmath40 into eqs .   and , and dropping the small nonlinear terms , we can get the linearized quantum langevin equations for the operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total ( linearized optomechanical ) coupling strength",
    ".    now we move into another interaction picture by introducing @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , we assume the cavity is driven by a control field at the mechanical red sideband with @xmath48 , the system is operating in the resolved sideband regime @xmath49 , the mechanical resonator has a high mechanical quality factor @xmath50 , and the mechanical frequency @xmath51 is much larger than @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this parameter regime ,",
    "analogous to the rotating wave approximation presented in the context of atomic eit , one can ignore the fast oscillating terms @xmath54 and get the following equations : @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "then we take the expectation values of the operators in eqs .   and .",
    "note that the mean values of the quantum and thermal noise terms are zero ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) . under steady - state condition @xmath57 ,",
    "one has @xmath58 thus , the expectation value of the operator @xmath59 corresponding to intra - cavity field oscillating at the probe frequency reads @xmath60 .",

    "the intra - cavity field with probe frequency is determined by the interference of these two terms and is strongly dependent on the relative phase of the applied driving fields .",
    "thus we can control the transmission of the probe field by adjusting the total phase @xmath61 .",
    "the output field of the cavity can be derived by the input - output relation @xcite @xmath67 with the external loss rate @xmath68 . when the the coupling parameter @xmath69 , the cavity is undercoupling , and when @xmath70 , the cavity is overcoupled @xcite .",
    "experimentally , @xmath71 can be continuously adjusted @xcite .    here",
    ", we concentrate on the component of the output field oscillating at the probe frequency . to study the phase - dependent optical response properties for the probe field , we define the corresponding quadratures of the field @xmath72 . the transmission coefficient and power transmission coefficient can be further defined as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . at weak cavity - waveguide coupling @xmath69 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "thus , similar to atomic physics , we can use the real and imaginary parts of @xmath77 to represent absorptive and dispersive behavior of the probe field . in the following",
    ", the ratio between @xmath78 and @xmath79 is defined as @xmath80 .",
    "here we assume @xmath81 , i.e. , the cooperativity @xmath82 . in this regime , one can abtain typical omit or autler - townes splitting spectra if only the control and the probe fields are applied .",
    "but if an additional driving field is applied on the mechanical resonator , the interference between omit process and phonon - photon parametric process ( represented by the first and the second terms in eq .  , respectively ) can lead to the expected phase - dependent absorption spectra . in figs .",
    "[ eita](a)-[eita](d ) , we plot absorption @xmath83 , dispersion @xmath84 , and power transmission coefficient @xmath85 versus @xmath4 for different relative phase @xmath86 . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed the ratio of amplitude between the two weak drivings @xmath87 . when @xmath88 , the interference of the two terms in eq .",
    "results in absorption and anomalous dispersion around @xmath89= 0 .",
    "when @xmath90 , we can get asymmetric gain spectra with transparency point at @xmath91 and absorption and amplification appear in the red- and blue - detuned regions , respectively .",
    "the nature of dispersion is normal in the transparency and amplification regions where quantum interferences are prominent . when @xmath92 , a remarkable probe gain can be established between two autler - townes absorption peaks , with the maximum gain point being located at @xmath93= 0 .",
    "the curve @xmath94 exhibits normal dispersive behavor in the amplification regime . when @xmath95 , we attain the mirror image of the @xmath90 absorption curve .",
    "note that figs .",
    "[ eita](a)-[eita](d ) exhibit the similar type of phase - dependent gwi absorption spectra as those in @xmath15-type superconducting artificial atoms @xcite .",
    "but there also exist some differences between them . specifically , a @xmath15-type artificial atom is a three - level system , and one can easily check that when such an atom is driven by three coherent fields ( i.e. , a strong control , a weak probe , and an additional weak auxiliary field , respectively ) , the populations of the two levels related to the probe transition are inversionless @xcite . while an optomechanical cavity is a system with infinite number of energy levels @xmath96 [ @xmath97(@xmath0 ) denotes the number of photons ( phonons ) ] , the probe field couples all the transitions @xmath98 [ see fig .",
    "[ om system](b ) ] , and the population - inversionless condition between these pairs of states is not necessarily satisfied .",
    "thus we term the spectra in fig .",
    "[ eita ] as _ gwi - like absorption spectra_.      when @xmath99 , i.e. , the cooperativity @xmath100 , the expectation value of the fluctuation operator @xmath41 can be approximately written as @xmath101 .\\ ] ] clearly , the first term shows that in this parameter regime , the omit effect vanishes , the probe absorption spectrum will exhibit usual lorentz line shape with width @xmath27 in the absence of the driving field @xmath13 .",
    "however , in our case , due to the existence of @xmath13 , the photons generated by the phonon - photon parametric process can interfere constructively or destructively ( depending on the phase factor @xmath86 ) with the photons directly exited by the probe beam , leading to a narrow spectral structure with width @xmath28 added on the original absorption spectrum . in figs .",
    "[ eia](a)-[eia](c ) we plot absorption @xmath83 , dispersion @xmath84 , and power transmission coefficient @xmath85 curves in a narrow frequency range around @xmath102 to display these kinds of sharp spectral structures resulting from phase - dependent destructive / constructive interference effects .",
    "in addition , figs .",
    "[ eia ] ( d)-[eia](f ) give the power transmission coefficient curves in a wider frequency range from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "note that without loss of generality , we have let the ratio of amplitude between the two weak drivings equals to one ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) in fig .",
    "[ eia ] .    specifically , when @xmath88 , constructive interference occurs at @xmath106 , resulting in typical omia spectrum with very sharp absorption feature around the resonant point , as shown in figs .",
    "[ eia](a ) and [ eia](d ) .",
    "note that in optomechanical setups , similar omia spectrum for a probe field can also be abtained by placing a pump blue - detuned at a mechanical frequency away from cavity @xcite .",
    "also , another version of omia was predicted in a driving double - cavity configuration , where the absorption peak is established in the omit window @xcite .",
    "when @xmath92 , destructive interference occurs , thus a transparency or an amplification window can appear at the resonance point , depending on the value of @xmath107 .",
    "specifically , when @xmath108 , an eit - like power transmission curve can be abtained with the value of @xmath85 at the transparency dip being exactly one , as shown in figs .",
    "[ eia](b ) and [ eia](e ) . when @xmath109 , a gain dip can be established in the vicinity of cavity resonant point , as shown in figs .",
    "[ eia](c ) and [ eia](f ) .    finally , we make comparisons between the eit - like phenomenon shown in figs .",
    "[ eia](b ) and [ eia](e ) , and the standard omit phenomenon @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the coherent oscillation of the mechanical resonator induce sidebands on the cavity field .",
    "thus photons with frequency @xmath110 is generated and interfere destructively with the probe beam , resulting in a sharp transparency window splitting the probe absorption peak .",
    "however , the coherent oscillation of the mechanical resonator is attributed to different mechanism in these two cases . in standard omit phenomenon ,",
    "the mechanical resonator is driven by a time varying radiation pressure force induced by the beat of the probe laser and the control laser , and oscillates coherently . to manifest this effect , a relatively large effective optomechanical coupling constant with @xmath111 ( i.e. , @xmath112 )",
    "is required .",
    "while in present eit - like case , @xmath113 , the usual omit effect already vanishes , but the mechanical resonator is still directly driven by the external driving field with amplitude @xmath114 and oscillates coherently .",
    "thus the eit - like effect may provide an alternative way to control photon propagation even if the control field is too weak to produce usual omit phenomenon .",
    "note that in a recent experiment on coherent signal transfer between microwave and optical fields , this type of phenomenon has been used to demonstrate coherent interactions between microwave , mechanical and optical modes @xcite .",
    "usually , an amplifier based on optomechanical setup is realized by pumping the optomechnical cavity by a blue - detuned control field @xcite .",
    "our proposal shows that a red - detuned control field associating with an auxiliary driving applied to the mechanical resonator can also realize probe amplification . in previous subsections , to get power transmission spectra analogous to those have been investigated in atomic gases ( such as eia , gwi ) , we have taken coupling parameter @xmath69 , and have already shown a gain dip around @xmath106 when @xmath115 [ see fig .",
    "[ eita](c ) , figs .",
    "[ eia](c ) and [ eia](f ) ] . here , to abtain a remarkable amplification for a resonantly injected probe",

    "physically , the extra energy of the amplified probe is due to the contribution of the phonon - photon parametric process described by the second term in eq .",

    "in addition , figs .  [ amplifier](a ) and [ amplifier](b ) show that when @xmath119 and @xmath134 , or @xmath135 and @xmath136 , the power transmission coefficient for a resonant injected probe beam is zero , meaning that the probe can be totally absorbed . in figs .",
    "[ amplifier](e ) and [ amplifier](f ) , we plot the power transmission spectra for these two cases by setting @xmath105 , showing perfect absorption at resonant point .",
    "it is known that for over - coupled case @xmath116 , if a single probe laser drives the cavity , the output probe beam will leave the cavity without any absorption @xcite .",
    "however , in our case , because a control field @xmath10 and an auxiliary driving field @xmath114 are applied , destructive interference can lead to zero output for the probe field .",

    "we find that the response of the driven optomechanical system to the weak probe field depends on the total phase of three classical fields .",

    "<S> we explore theoretically the optical response properties in an optomechanical system under electromagnetically induced transparency condition but with the mechanical resonator being driven by an additional coherent field . in this configuration , </S>",
    "<S> more complex quantum coherent and interference phenomena occur . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the probe transmission spectra depend on the total phase of the applied fields . </S>",
    "<S> our study also provides an efficient way to control propagation of a probe field from perfect absorption to remarkable amplification . </S>"
