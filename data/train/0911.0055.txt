    "the embedded contact homology ( ech ) of a closed , oriented @xmath3-manifold with a contact form was introduced by hutchings in @xcite and is a variant of the symplectic field theory  @xcite of eliashberg , givental and hofer . it is defined in terms of a contact form but is an invariant of the underlying @xmath3-manifold .",
    "this invariance has been established by taubes in @xcite via the identification with seiberg - witten floer ( co-)homology as defined by kronheimer and mrowka  @xcite and in particular implies the weinstein conjecture in dimension three .",

    "a natural condition to impose on a compact , oriented contact @xmath4-manifold @xmath5 with boundary is to require that @xmath6 be _ convex _ , i.e. , there is a contact vector field @xmath7 transverse to @xmath8 . to a transverse contact vector field",

    "we will denote by @xmath16 the contact manifold @xmath5 with convex boundary and dividing set @xmath17 with respect to some transverse contact vector field @xmath7 .",
    "note that the actual boundary condition we need is slightly different and is called a _ sutured boundary condition_. ( in the early 1980 s , gabai developed the theory of sutured manifolds  @xcite , which became a powerful tool in studying @xmath3-manifolds with boundary . ) for the moment we write @xmath18 to indicate either the convex boundary condition or the sutured boundary condition .",
    "it turns out that there is a way to generalize embedded contact homology to sutured @xmath3-manifolds .",
    "this is possible by imposing a certain convexity condition on the contact form .",
    "this construction is completely described in the paper of colin , ghiggini , honda and hutchings @xcite .",
    "heegaard floer homology also admits a sutured version , namely the sutured floer homology ( sfh ) of juhsz  @xcite , which is an invariant of sutured manifolds .",
    "finally , kronheimer and mrowka in @xcite introduced the sutured version of seiberg - witten floer homology .    extending the conjectured equivalence of heegaard floer homology and embedded contact homology , the following conjecture was formulated in  @xcite :    [ conj_echsfh ] @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the relative spin@xmath21-structure determined by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in this paper , we construct sutured contact solid torus with @xmath2 parallel longitudinal sutures , where @xmath24 , using the gluing method of colin , ghiggini , honda and hutchings @xcite and calculate the sutured embedded contact homology of it .",
    "we apply the gluing method in such a way that the constructed sutured solid torus is equipped with a nondegenerate contact form satisfying the property that all closed embedded reeb orbits are noncontractible , define the same homology class and have the same symplectic action .",
    "it turns out that for the constructed sutured manifolds the sutured version of embedded contact homology coincides with sutured floer homology . the corresponding calculation in sutured floer homology",
    "has been done by juhsz in @xcite .",
