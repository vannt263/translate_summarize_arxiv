    "_ communities _ are the basic structures in sociology in general and in social networks in particular .",

    ", community usually refers to a social unit whose members share common values and the identity of the members as well as their degree of cohesiveness depend on individuals social and cognitive factors such as beliefs , preferences , or needs .",
    "the ubiquity of the internet and social media eliminated spatial limitations on community range , enabling on - line communities to link people regardless of their physical location . the newly arising _ computational sociology",
    "_ relies on computationally intensive methods to analyze and model social phenomena @xcite , including communities and their detection .",
    "analysis of social networks became one of the basic tools of sociology @xcite and has been used for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory .",
    "the classical example of the approach is presented in @xcite that elaborated the macro implications of one aspect of small - scale interaction , the strength of dyadic ties . moreover , a lot of commercial applications , such as digital marketing , behavioral targeting and user preference mining , rely heavily on community analysis .    with the rapid growth of large - scale on - line social networks , e.g. ,",
    "facebook connected a billion users in 2012 , there is a high demand for efficient community detection algorithms that will be able to handle their evolution growth .",
    "communities in on - line social networks are discovered by analyzing the observed and often recorded on - line interactions between people .",
    "numerous techniques have been developed for community detection .",
    "however , most of them require a _ global _ and often _",
    "static _ view of the network and ignore temporal correlations between different snapshots over time .",
    "such algorithms are not scalable enough to cope with dynamically evolving networks , especially when new data about them are generated continuously .",
    "another limitation shared by most of the existing algorithms is that they are applicable only to networks with binary adjacency matrix , that is with undirected and unweighted edges",
    ".    label propagation based community detection algorithms such as lpa @xcite , copra @xcite and slpa @xcite have been shown to perform well in static networks . however , due to random tie breaking strategy , they produce different partitions in different runs .",
    "such instability is highly undesirable when tracking the evolution of communities in a dynamic network .",
    "the contributions of this paper are two - fold .",
    "first , we generalized the _",
    "labelrank _ algorithm introduced in @xcite to incorporate important network features such as edge weights and directions .",
    "second , built upon _",
    ", we introduce _ labelrankt _ algorithm that incrementally detects evolving communities in dynamic networks .",
    "the new algorithm presented here delivers significant improvements over the existing solutions in both the quality of detected evolving communities and the speed of program execution .",
    "to make the paper self - contained , this section first summarizes and generalizes the _ labelrank _ algorithm introduced in @xcite which is the basis for _ labelranlt_. both algorithms are based on the idea of simulating the propagation of labels in the network .",
    "labelrank _ relies on four operators applied to the labels : ( i ) propagation , ( ii ) inflation , ( iii ) cutoff , and ( iv ) conditional update .",
    "the data structure that lies in the core of this algorithm is the sparse matrix of label distribution .",
    "each node maintains a label distribution locally during the propagation . at the end of the algorithm , _ labelrank _",
    "ranks labels in each node .",
    "nodes with the same highest probability label form a community .",
    "_ labelrank _ , a stabilized lpa , was initially introduced in @xcite for binary networks . here",
    ", we generalize the propagation operation over edges in order to take both edge direction and weight into account . given a network @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of edges and @xmath2 is the set of nodes , this operator can be expressed in matrix form as : @xmath3    add self - loop to adjacency matrix @xmath4 initialize label distribution @xmath5 using eq .",
    "[ eq : initp ] @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 output communities    where @xmath4 is the @xmath10 weight matrix and @xmath11 is the number of nodes",
    ". for each @xmath12 , if there exist a directed edge @xmath13 from node @xmath14 to @xmath15 , @xmath12 takes on a positive value ; otherwise it is 0 .",
    "@xmath16 is the weight placed on the directed edge , which bears important and application specific information .",
    "@xmath5 is the @xmath10 _ label distribution matrix_. label is just a unique identifier . for simplicity , it usually takes on the same value as the node i d .",
    "@xmath5 is composed of @xmath11 @xmath17 row vectors @xmath18 , one for each node @xmath15 .",
    "each element @xmath19 or @xmath20 holds the current estimation of probability of node @xmath15 observing label @xmath21 taken from a finite set of alphabet @xmath22 ( here @xmath23 ) .",
    "each node broadcasts the distribution to its neighbors at each iteration step and computes the new distribution @xmath24 simultaneously using the following equation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a set of neighbors of node @xmath15 and the numerator sums up weights of all edges incoming node @xmath15 .",
    "that is , a node sends out its information along outgoing edges to its neighbors and at the same time receives information along incoming edges from the neighborhood . note that",
    ", @xmath24 is normalized to make proper probability distribution .",
    "one can show that the new distribution vector @xmath24 is the distribution that minimizes the kl divergence between any possible @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .    to initialize @xmath5 , each node",
    "is assigned a distribution of probabilities of all incoming edges by assigning to each incoming edge the initial probability of seeing this neighbor s label proportional to the weight of this edge : @xmath29    we briefly characterize the three remaining operations of _ labelrank _ as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the inflation operator @xmath30 on @xmath5 @xcite is used to contract the propagation , where @xmath31 is the parameter taking on real values .",
    "it operates on the label distribution matrix @xmath5 ( rather than to a stochastic matrix or adjacency matrix ) to decouple it from the network structure . after applying @xmath32 ,",
    "each @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath19 rises to the @xmath34 power .",
    "\\(2 ) the full label propagation distribution induces a cost for memory . to alleviate this problem , the cutoff operator @xmath35 on @xmath5 is introduced to remove labels that are below threshold @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "more importantly , @xmath35 is shown empirically to reduce the space complexity efficiently , from quadratic to linear .",
    "the average number of labels in each node is typically less than @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "\\(3 ) the conditional update @xmath39 operator is used to trap the process in the quality space ( e.g. , modularity @xcite ) to avoid trivial network state where each node holds the same distribution .",
    "the algorithm updates a node only when it is significantly different from its neighbors in terms of labels .",
    "this allows us to preserve detected communities and detect termination based on scarcity of changes to the network . at each iteration",
    ", the change is accepted only by nodes that satisfy the following update condition : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the set of maximum labels which includes labels with the maximum probability at node @xmath15 at the previous time step .",
    "function @xmath42 returns @xmath43 if @xmath44 , and @xmath45 otherwise .",
    "@xmath46 is the degree of node @xmath15 , and @xmath47 is a real number parameter chosen from the interval @xmath48 $ ] . intuitively , _",
    "issubset _ can be viewed as a measure of similarity between two nodes .",

    "labelrankt_. ]            the running time of the generalized labelrank is the same as the original algorithm , as it is @xmath54 , linear with the number of edges @xmath55 .",
    "the space complexity is @xmath56 in practice because the number of labels in each node monotonically decreases and drops to a small constant in a few steps due to both cutoff and inflation operators .",
    "the @xmath5 matrix is replaced by sparse matrix representation of @xmath11 variable - length list of pairs ( usually short ) carried by each node ; each pair contains label and its probability ( with labels whose probability reduced to @xmath45 not listed ) .",
    "unlike in binary networks , there are various ways of adding a self - loop to each node to stabilize the results .",
    "it is interesting to see that the algorithm might perform slightly differently with different ways of defining self - loop .",
    "the most common ways include setting @xmath57 , @xmath58 or @xmath59 . in the experiments",
    "run for this paper , we use @xmath57 . yet , it is still an open question how to optimally select the selfloop weight for each node .",
    "the extended algorithm called _ labelrankt _ is based on the generalized _ labelrank _ introduced in alg .",
    "[ alg1 ] . the description of _ labelrankt _ is contained in alg .  [ alg2 ] .",
    "the main idea is to adjust our detection as the network structure changes .",
    "we take advantage of what we already obtain in previous snapshot for inferring the dynamics in the current time step .",
    "since local structure information is encoded in the node label distributions , the evolving of communities is expected to be caught and reflected in these distributions .",
    "_ labelrankt _ can be viewed as a _ labelrank _ with one extra conditional update rule by which only nodes involved any change accept the new distribution .",
    "moreover , we only need to update nodes that are changed between two consecutive snapshots , including cases where an existing node adds or deletes links , or a node is removed from or newly joins the network .",
    "an example that shows different evolution events in three consecutive snapshots , g(0 ) , g(1 ) and g(2 ) is shown in figs . [",
    "fig : g0 ] , [ fig : g1 ] and [ fig : g2 ] . during the evolution , nodes ( edges ) are added or removed , and communities split , merge and dissolve , all of which is captured by _",
    "labelrankt_. to discover communities in these snapshots , we ran our algorithm with the same parameters for all three snapshots .    in our algorithm ,",
    "all these cases are handled by simply comparing neighbors of a node @xmath15 at two consecutive steps , @xmath51 and @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath61 and @xmath62 are not equal , then node @xmath15 is called a _ changed _ node . for changed nodes ,",
    "we reinitialize their label distributions ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) and update until the simulation stops as in _",
    "labelrank_. however , since only changed nodes and their neighbors are involved ( some neighbors only propagate labels but not update ) , _ labelrankt _ is more efficient than _",
    "labelrank_.    such conditional update rule makes _ labelrankt _",
    "applicable to dynamic networks for which changes arrive as a stream .",
    "when a new edge arrives in the incoming stream , _ labelrankt _ only updates the nodes that are attached to this edge .",
    "labelrankt _ can efficiently update and monitor communities whose evolution generates huge real - time data streams , such as the internet and on - line social networks .",
    "the time complexity for _ labelrankt _ can be derived as follows .",
    "it is easy to see for step ( a ) that we can track the number of changed nodes in o(1 ) . for steps ( b ) and",
    "( c ) , since at most @xmath11 can be changed , we need to communicate across each edge at most twice in each iteration . since the number of iterations required is a constant @xmath63 ( usually less than 50 iterations ) , the overall complexity for detecting evolving communities between two consecutive snapshots is @xmath64 , implying @xmath54 in general .        ) and deleted ( @xmath65 ) , as well as the number of nodes involved in changes ( @xmath66 ) . ]",

    "labelrankt _ is more than 100 times faster than both facetnet and ilcd on the two datasets used here .",
    "we also analyzed the number of communities and the distribution of community sizes relative to @xmath11 ( i.e. , the probability of seeing a community with certain size ) , produced by _",

    "[ fig : as-1days - comdist - bar - winsert ] , as graph does not evolve smoothly all the time . the abrupt drop in the number of communities at time 410 signals a dramatic change in structure , which is verified by a completely different distribution of community sizes in comparison with the beginning one .",
    "although this violates our assumption , _ labelrankt _ still worked well as evidenced by consistency of its results with the results of static algorithm infomap . in contrast , arxiv hep - th exhibits a fairly smooth pattern shown in fig .",
