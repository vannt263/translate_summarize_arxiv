    "resummation is often required in a perturbation theory to avoid infrared ( ir ) divergences to appear at finite energy scales .",
    "examples are 1pi diagram resummation ( schwinger - dyson equation ) to cure the on - shell singularity of the propagator , or daisy resummation @xcite to resum ir divergences of massless theories at finite temperature .",
    "we need leading ( or higher order ) logarithmic resummation near a second order phase transition point @xcite , and the htl resummation @xcite to be able to consistently define finite temperature observables in gauge theories .",
    "resummation means reorganization of the perturbative series in a way that the diagrams that are most important from the point of view of ir behavior , are taken into account first .",
    "however , ir importance does not necessarily means uv importance as well , and so it can happen that those ( counterterm ) diagrams that are needed to make the theory finite , are shifted to a later stage in the resummation process .",
    "then we observe that lower order results are divergent meaning that the resummed perturbation theory is _",
    "inconsistent_. exceptions are the 1pi and leading log resummations , where , by chance , diagrams of ir and uv importance are the same , but other cases ( daisy , super - daisy , htl etc . resummations ) suffer from this difficulty .",
    "therefore , in these cases , the physically well - motivated resummation equations ( gap equations ) are meaningless in principle , and one usually makes some ad hoc assumption to obtain finite results .",
    "recently several papers were published that investigate this problem in various physical situations @xcite . in the present paper we try to go around the question of how to construct countertem diagrams for a given _ momentum independent _ resummation .",
    "we try to give two points of view on the problem : one is a direct method where we make explicit resummation for the counterterm diagrams , induced by the resummation of the `` normal '' diagrams ( section  [ sec : massresum ] ) .",
    "the relevant counterterm diagrams can be constructed in each perturbative order , and finally we give an explicit form for the resummed lagrangian . to be more specific , we suggest , in @xmath0 theory , the following reorganization of the mass terms in the lagrangian in @xmath1  scheme to regularize the mass resummation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the multiplicative mass renormalization factor in @xmath1  scheme , and @xmath4 .",
    "this proposal is a generalization of the method of banerjee and mallik @xcite . at one hand",
    "this expression is equivalent with @xmath5 , so non - perturbatively we have the same physics .",
    "on the other hand we will prove that , if we take into account the under - braced terms first in one , and two loop levels , respectively , we obtain a mass resummed perturbation theory that consistently removes all the divergencies at any order .",
    "one of the most important corollary of these investigations is the following rule of thumb : we can renormalize the gap equations for mass resummation by _ first renormalizing the diagrams _ in an appropriate mass independent physical scheme ( eg .",
    "@xmath1 ) , and _ afterwards substituting the resummed parameters _ in the finite expressions . as it will be seen later on ,",
    "although this is not the most generic renormalization method , still it is a possible and consistent way to deal with uv divergences .",
    "this strategy was already used in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the study of phase diagram of the quark - meson model .",
    "the other point of view treats resummed perturbation theory as a different renormalization scheme ( section  [ sec : rg ] ) .",
    "we call this scheme , in which we impose environment ( @xmath6 or even time ) dependent renormalization conditions as _ resummation ( rs ) scheme_. this is not a physical choice , since changing the environment results in changing of the renormalization scheme . in order to have a meaningful result we have to relate the rs scheme and a bona fide renormalization scheme , eg",
    ". @xmath1 .",
    "this means constructing relations between the parameters of the renormalized lagrangians of the two schemes which formally appear as _",
    "gap equations_.    in several applications we need the inverse procedure : one has a physically motivated gap equation , and one would like to know the corresponding structure of counterterms . in this approach",
    "we consider the gap equations as relations between the @xmath1  and some rs scheme . expanding the gap equation in terms of the coupling constant we can read off the finite difference that has to be added to the @xmath1  counterterm to obtain the rs scheme counterterm .",
    "thus the rs scheme is defined , and so we can use perturbation theory to calculate any observables we need . if the choice of the gap equations was good enough , we will observe cancellations between the `` normal '' and counterterm diagrams .",
    "the diagrams that survive cancellation are not part of the resummation , and they can be used eventually to improve the resummation process .",
    "the paper ends with conclusions and an outlook ( section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "our basic model is the @xmath0 model where the lagrangian reads in terms of renormalized couplings and fields as @xmath7 as it is well known @xcite , in this model perturbation theory becomes unreliable at high temperatures , because of the presence of diagrams giving @xmath8 contribution .",
    "this ( ir ) problem can be cured by summing all the dominant tadpole contribution of the theory ( `` daisy diagrams '' ) . by this procedure one",
    "effectively replaces the mass @xmath9 by the resummed mass @xmath10 ( where , in this theory , @xmath11 to leading order ) , making the ir problem disappear ( apart from the phase transition point @xcite ) .    since the daisy resummation does nothing else than replacing the mass with a different mass , it is equivalent with the `` thermal counterterm '' procedure @xcite .",
    "we add to and subtract from the lagrangian the same , temperature dependent term ; the relevant part of the lagrangian therefore reads @xmath12 as usual , the added term is treated as a part of the free lagrangian while the subtracted term , on the other hand , is taken into account one loop later as a ( thermal ) counterterm . by doing this we reinterpreted the perturbation theory , ie .",
    "we defined a resummation .",
    "the value of @xmath13 can be chosen to be the tadpole value , but its `` best value '' can be found out from the condition that at one loop order the self - energy is zero @xmath14 this is a gap equation @xcite which is to be solved to find @xmath13 .",
    "it turns out , however , that this naive definition is not consistent @xcite because of the mismatch in the counterterm diagrams . to see this we calculate the one loop self energy in the @xmath0 theory @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bosonic tadpole function ; in dimensional regularization it reads : @xmath17 +    \\frac1{2\\pi^2}\\int\\limits_m^\\infty\\ !",

    "that fixes the one - loop mass counterterm as @xmath20.\\ ] ] so we have a divergency @xmath21 and a counterterm @xmath22 , that do not cancel each other .",
    "there is an unbalanced divergency , and so the rs scheme is inconsistent .",
    "since at the non - perturbative level ( infinite order ) the resummed theory is equivalent with the original one ( they have the same lagrangian ) , we expect that this divergence vanishes by higher loop effects .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in the next order ( two loop in case of mass ) we indeed obtain contributions that cancel this divergence  however , other new unbalanced divergences appear in this order .",
    "so finally the perturbation theory will not be consistent at any finite loop level .      in order to make the theory consistent ,",
    "we should find some method to shift up to one loop level those two - loop diagrams that are necessary to cancel the unbalanced divergences at one loop order : ie .",
    "we have to reorganize ( resum ) the .",
    "the idea is the same as in the case of the thermal mass .",
    "we find the correction to the counterterm , add it to and subtract it from the lagrangian , but classify them to belong to different loop orders .",
    "let us denote the necessary mass term by @xmath23 and call it _ compensating counterterm_. so , instead of ( [ eq : thermmass ] ) , we use the following mass terms in the lagrangian : @xmath24 in perturbation theory the first term is taken into account in the propagator , the second and third are taken into account first at one loop level , while the last term first contributes at two - loop level .",
    "@xmath23 has to be determined order by order in a way that it cancels the remaining divergence of the physical observable at a given order .",
    "although it is temperature dependent and also divergent in the present example , its value is irrelevant from the point of view of the consistency of the complete theory , since the lagrangian is the same as the original one , it does not depend on the value of @xmath25 .    using the proposed decomposition of the lagrangian corresponding to ( [ eq : corrthermmass ] )",
    "let us compute the resummed and renormalized self - energy of the @xmath0 model .      at one loop level",
    "the self - energy reads with this new counterterm structure as @xmath26 @xmath27 is defined in ( [ msbardeltam2 ] ) ; it cancels a part of the divergence hidden in @xmath16 , the rest has to be canceled by @xmath28 .",
    "we can choose it in analogy with the @xmath1  form ( [ msbardeltam2 ] ) @xmath29.\\ ] ] in principle we could add an arbitrary finite term to this form .",
    "this would modify the value of @xmath13 , and finally would lead to a different resummation process . in the language of section",
    "[ sec : rg ] it would correspond to a different renormalization scheme in the zero and finite temperature parts . for further details cf .",
    "section  [ sec : rg ] .    with this choice , using the form of @xmath16 from ( [ tb ] ) we find @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath1  renormalized tadpole diagram .",
    "we could obtain this result by first renormalizing the divergent diagrams in @xmath1  scheme , and afterwards by substituting the resummed mass into the finite expression .",
    "now let us turn to the determination of the self - energy at two loop level .",

    "@xmath37 , where @xmath38 the other counterterms read as @xmath39 using these values the divergent part is still not canceled , what remains is : @xmath40 to cancel this divergency we can choose @xmath41 , although , of course , an arbitrary finite part could be added to this expression .",
    "with this choice , however , we get further support to the practical observation of the one loop calculation : we first do renormalization in @xmath1  scheme , and substitute the resummation mass in the finite expressions . it should be clear , too , that we could add finite terms for @xmath28 and @xmath42 , and then this statement would not be true any more .",
    "thus this is just a  comfortable  possibility .",
    "one can conjecture that this feature persists at higher loop orders , since in @xmath1  scheme the overall divergency of a diagram always can be written as @xmath43 with some mass - independent @xmath44 factor .",
    "then , by choosing @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the overall divergency disappears .",
    "this should also be true for any other mass - independent schemes .",
    "we can , therefore , put forward a proposition :    * proposition : *    if in a renormalization scheme the zero temperature counterterm is @xmath47 and @xmath44 is mass - independent , then at finite temperature the theory with thermal counterterm @xmath13 and compensating counterterm @xmath48 yields finite result at each order of the perturbation theory .",
    "_ proof _ :    let us consider a 2-point diagram @xmath49 in the original ( not resummed ) theory that has an overall divergence , and all the subdivergences were consistently subtracted .",
    "then , if the theory is renormalizable , the divergence of the diagram should be proportional to @xmath9 ; the proportionality constant can be obtained as @xmath50 .",
    "since the divergence is canceled by the counterterm @xmath47 , the divergent part should be equal to an appropriate part from the mass renormalization factor @xmath44 , which is mass independent @xmath51    in the resummed theory we have two effects .",
    "one is the substitution of the mass term by the resummed mass : @xmath52 .",
    "the divergent parts of the self energy diagrams , in our mass - independent scheme , are proportional to this new mass term .",
    "but we have also prepared the corresponding counterterm , since the third term of ( [ eq : corrthermmass ] ) reads @xmath53 .",
    "so this part of the divergences disappear in the same way as in the unresummed case .",
    "the other effect is the @xmath54 insertion coming from the second ( thermal ) counterterm of ( [ eq : corrthermmass ] ) .",
    "the sum of the single mass insertion diagrams is just @xmath55 , because at each propagator @xmath56 ( it is evident for feynman propagators , at finite temperature it can be seen using imaginary time propagators ) . its divergent part can be written , using ( [ dz ] ) , as @xmath57 .",
    "this is exactly canceled by the corresponding part of the compensating counterterm at this order : @xmath58 .",
    "so at each diagram the overall divergences are canceled by the proposed counterterms .",
    "using bphz argumentation , this is enough to make the complete theory finite .",
    "now we have a consistent method for how to reorganize the perturbation theory according to a given ( mass ) resummation in such a way as to have finite results in all orders in @xmath1  scheme . in order to generalize the result so as to be able to treat other schemes ( not just @xmath1 ) , or environment dependence of other couplings ( cf .",
    "vertex resummation ) , we change our viewpoint , and we rephrase the complete resummation procedure using the renormalization group ( rg ) argumentation : this will be the topic of the present section .",
    "first we demonstrate at one loop level that we can obtain the results of the previous section using a special renormalization scheme .",
    "we define the mass counterterm of the new scheme as @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the @xmath1  counterterm and @xmath61 is an arbitrary , finite expression .",
    "the other counterterms are the same as in @xmath1  scheme",
    ". then the one loop self energy reads @xmath62 this expression differs in a finite term from the corresponding @xmath1  expression . at one hand",
    "it assures finiteness , on the other hand this means that the new mass parameter must be different from the @xmath1  mass parameter in order to describe the same physics .",
    "in fact , applying the ideas of the renormalization theory @xcite to the present case , there must be a choice @xmath63 for which we have the same value _ for all observables _ in the two schemes at a given order .",
    "this function can be read off from the requirement that the bare parameters are the same in the two schemes @xcite : @xmath64 then the counterterm of the new scheme ( [ newscheme ] ) can be written as @xmath65 this is the result of the proposition of subsection [ sec : higherloop ] applied to the one loop case .    for the definition of the new scheme we need to specify a value for @xmath61 .",
    "we may , for example , choose the mass shell scheme , where the full self - energy reads @xmath66 . from ( [ newschemeselfen ] ) and ( [ matchnewscheme ] ) we find for the value of @xmath61 @xmath67 where @xmath68 now means the tadpole diagram , renormalized in the @xmath69 scheme .",
    "this equation is the renormalized gap equation for the mass .",
    "this analysis suggests that the mass resummation is equivalent with the choice of a new renormalization scheme . using the relation of the masses of the two schemes",
    ", we can compute finite observables that can be interpreted as the result of the resummed @xmath1  scheme .",
    "the mass relation , together with the definition of the new scheme yields finite gap equation for the new ( resummed ) mass , which is the usual gap equation in case of the mass shell scheme .",
    "motivated by the previous subsection , we can start to build up the resummation strategy from the point of view of renormalization schemes .",
    "resummation itself means that some higher order diagrams are taken into account at lower levels with the consequence that these diagrams are missing from the higher order calculation .",
    "so , at least for the mass and coupling constant resummation , resummation is equivalent with a scheme that cancels these diagrams with a proper choice of the finite part of the counterterms .",
    "since we play only with the finite part of the counterterms , we will still have a consistent scheme .",
    "so this new scheme ",
    "the _ resummation ( rs ) scheme _  differs from a general scheme ( eg .",
    "@xmath1 ) in that a certain set of diagrams is missing from the calculation .",
    "the rs scheme is a bona fide scheme while we keep the counterterms fixed : for example we can equally well use the ms and the @xmath1  schemes .",
    "however , at finite temperature , the finite parts of the counterterms will depend on temperature , and so the resummation scheme itself varies with temperature . in a more general case rs scheme can depend on the complete environment @xcite : beyond the temperature on chemical potential , background condensates , time , etc . since results in different schemes have different physical interpretation , rs scheme can not directly describe the effects of the environment variation .",
    "example is the mass shell scheme where @xmath70 , and we have no explicit temperature dependence . to be able to draw physical consequences , we have to project the results to a common reference scheme .    technically what we should do is to relate the rs scheme to a physical renormalization scheme  for concreteness we will use the @xmath1  scheme .",
    "since both of them are mathematically correct schemes , in case of renormalizable theories , this can be accomplished by changing the values of renormalized parameters of the lagrangian @xcite ( including wave function renormalization ) . in @xmath0 theory there",
    "must exist environment - dependent parameters @xmath71 such as for any @xmath72-point function with momenta @xmath73 we have @xmath74 in perturbation theory the equality holds only up to the computed order ; in fact the difference is the effect of resummation .",
    "the value of the `` running '' parameters can be computed using the fact that the bare quantities are independent of the scheme @xcite . in this way we can use the rs scheme for perturbation theory , enjoying its good ir convergence , and still have results in a physical renormalization scheme ( eg .",
    "@xmath1 ) , where also the parameters of the theory can be obtained from the usual renormalization conditions .",
    "sometimes we can explicitly define the new scheme ( eg . the mass shell scheme for mass resummation ) , but more often we just have a guess for the resummed parameters , and we hope that it performs some kind of resummation .",
    "that is we start with explicit functions of the form of ( [ eq : relation ] ) for the resummed mass and coupling constant ( and eventually , wave function renormalization ) .",
    "according to the line of thought above these relations can be interpreted as generators of a rs scheme : we expand them in power series in @xmath75 @xmath76 and we interpret @xmath77 as the @xmath72th order finite mass counterterm that has to be added to the @xmath1  counterterm ; similarly , @xmath78 is the finite coupling constant counterterm , @xmath79 is the finite wave function renormalization counterterm .",
    "having defined the counterterms , the rs scheme is appropriate to do perturbation theory , and the results can be related to the @xmath1  scheme by the same relations ( [ eq : relation ] ) . if our guess was good enough we will observe cancellation between `` normal '' and counterterm diagrams at higher orders .",
    "the main message , however , is that , independently of whether a choice represents a physically meaningful resummation or not , _ any choice _ leads to a finite , consistent perturbation theory .",
    "so as a possible strategy for resummation , we can do the following : we perform regularized perturbation theory in a generic scheme , keeping counterterms free , at a certain loop order .",
    "the divergent part of the counterterms are then fixed , as usual , to cancel the uv divergences of the diagrams , while the finite parts are fixed to cancel the ir dangerous parts .",
    "so we defined a scheme , which is , however , only a rs scheme , since the counterterms can depend on the environment .",
    "we determine its relation to the @xmath1  scheme of the form ( [ eq : relation ] ) by requiring that the bare parameters should be the same in the two schemes .",
    "this relation , by construction , corresponds to a resummation up to this perturbative order , and we should have some plausible guess to choose the higher order terms , hoping that it still performs some kind of resummation .",
    "different choices , of course , correspond to different resummations .",
    "this procedure can be repeated at each perturbative order , and so the resummation process can be improved .",
    "using the ideas of the previous subsection , in this section we perform both mass and coupling constant resummation .",
    "this latter is important to describe the `` softening '' of the theory close to a phase transition point @xcite , and also to consistently describe vertex resummation @xcite .    at one loop level we can start from the effective potential @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the effective , background dependent mass and coupling constant then reads @xmath82 a possible way of doing coupling constant resummation that we make vanish all of the terms below @xmath83 .",
    "that means : @xmath84 for the mass resummation we demand that @xmath85 ; with the @xmath86 value defined above we obtain @xmath87 this counterterm depends on the background only at @xmath88 order .",
    "if @xmath89 depends on the environment , these two counterterms define an environment dependent rs scheme .",
    "if we denote by @xmath90 and @xmath91 the divergent parts according to the @xmath1  scheme , and by @xmath92 and @xmath93 the finite parts  scheme @xmath94 and so @xmath95 , then we can write @xmath96 using the renormalization scheme independence of the bare parameters we can relate the resummed and the @xmath1  parameters at one loop level as @xmath97 these equations determine the relation between the parameters of the rs scheme and of the @xmath1  scheme ; but it can also be interpreted as the formulae for how to resum diagrams in the @xmath1   scheme .",
    "in fact , by the renormalization prescriptions of the rs scheme , @xmath98 is the complete static 4-point function and @xmath9 is the complete mass .    the gap equations ( [ gapeq ] ) are derived at one loop level , and are not necessarily useful at higher orders , that is it does not necessarily resum any subset of diagrams .",
    "there are arguments , however , that help to guess the correct form . to achieve super - daisy resummation , for example",
    ", we should use the resummed mass in the one loop expressions : that suggest that we should always use @xmath9 in the right hand side of ( [ gapeq ] ) and @xmath98 if it is multiplied with @xmath99 .",
    "then all the possible mass resummations are done , so we should use @xmath75 for any other appearance of the coupling constant in the expression of the mass resummation . for the explicit coupling constants in the @xmath98 resummation we recall that the double scoop ( two bubbles ) diagram contributes @xmath100 , but",
    "if we iterate the expression for @xmath98 as a function of @xmath75 in ( [ gapeq ] ) , we would get @xmath101 . to cure this problem we should write @xmath102 instead of @xmath103 .",
    "so , finally , the proposed form for the resummation reads @xmath104 and @xmath81 , in agreement with 4pi suggestions @xcite .      from ( [ newschemeselfen ] ) and ( [ eq : v  ] )",
    "we find @xmath105 , and so we can write @xmath106 it is instructive to examine these expressions for small masses .",
    "since the result of the finite temperature part has @xmath107 as the only dimensionless quantity , this is equivalent to the high temperature approximation @xcite @xmath108 where @xmath109 . then , using the notation @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 then the gap equations read @xmath112 the second term of the rhs of ( [ eq : second ] ) depends on @xmath113 at @xmath88 order , thus it is consistent to omit its background dependence .",
    "the last term is the consequence of the choice of the @xmath1  counterterms .",
    "so we have @xmath114 the solution therefore reads @xmath115 where @xmath116,\\qquad    w=\\frac{\\lambda_{{\\ensuremath{\\overline{\\mathrm{ms}}}}}t}{16\\pi\\kappa},\\qquad \\kappa = 1 -    \\frac{\\lambda_{{\\ensuremath{\\overline{\\mathrm{ms}}}}}}{32\\pi^2}\\ln\\frac{t^2}{\\tilde\\mu^2}.\\ ] ]    the solution has some remarkable properties .",
    "first of all it is a completely finite result , we do not need to bother with renormalization any more . secondly ",
    "although coming from a high temperature expansion  it nicely extrapolates between the 4d and 3d fixed points of the system . for high scales , namely , ( [ resumresult ] ) can be approximated as ( we set @xmath117 ) @xmath118 the formula for @xmath98 is the result of the non - perturbative renormalization method of @xcite , where it was computed by the explicit summation of bubble diagrams .",
    "we can realize here the running coupling and mass in the @xmath1   scheme , and write @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "this corresponds to a 4d behavior in the @xmath1  scheme .    at high temperatures the @xmath121 term takes over in the coupling constant , and",
    "the system follows a different trajectory .",
    "while the mass runs in the same way as before , @xmath122    this resummation describes correctly the second order nature of the phase transition ( as opposed to the daisy resummation ) . denoting @xmath123",
    ", we find @xmath124 for @xmath125 . near the critical point the solution behaves as @xmath126 the critical exponent for the mass is @xmath127 in this case , the fixed point of the coupling constant is @xmath128 ( ie .",
    "it becomes gaussian ) , and the temperature dependence for the approach of this critical point is @xmath129 , where @xmath130 .",
    "this is exactly the behavior of the @xmath131 model at @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this simple approximation we resummed leading order diagrams in the large @xmath133 expansion , thus this agreement is not unexpected @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigated the question of to what extent the uv and ir regularization of a system , ie .",
    "renormalization and resummation can be reconciled .",
    "we described two methods : one is a constructive method of how to resum higher order counterterm diagrams in order to cure the uv divergences appearing in mass resummation in @xmath1   scheme . similarly to the thermal mass counterterm idea we introduced a `` compensating counterterm '' that has to be added to and subtracted from the original lagrangian , the two terms contributing at different loop order .",
    "the other method is a rephrasing of this idea in the language of the renormalization group .",
    "here we defined a new scheme , the resummation ( rs ) scheme , where the infinite part of the counterterms cancels the uv divergences , the finite part cancels the ir divergences of the theory at a given order .",
    "the drawback of this scheme is that it depends explicitly on the environment , but , with help of the renormalization group , we can project the results of the resummation scheme to a reference scheme , eg .",
    "@xmath1 . from the point of view of the resummation , this projection formally appears as a set of gap equations .",
    "we demonstrated these ideas by performing coupling constant and mass resummation in the @xmath0 model .    in practice usually",
    "the problem of resummation and renormalization comes up in two forms .",
    "the first arises when we work on a diagrammatic basis and we compute a gap equation . at first glance the divergences of the resummed diagrams and counterterms",
    "do not cancel each other , so we wonder whether there is a method to consistently renormalize the divergent gap equations .",
    "we give positive answer to this question , proposing to use the compensating counterterm , or renormalization group ideas described in the paper . as a rule of thumb we can use that prescription that , for mass resummation in mass independent scheme , we first renormalize the equation perturbatively , and we apply this finite expression to compute the resummed parameters .",
    "the other type of problem is when we modify our finite gap equation in a well motivated way , hoping that it catches important higher order effects , and we wonder whether the new form is compatible with renormalization .",
    "the answer is again positive : any form of the gap equation is compatible with renormalization .",
    "technically we should treat our gap equations as transformation equations from @xmath1   scheme to a specific rs scheme .",
    "expansion of the solution of gap equations in terms of the coupling constants yields the finite difference of the counterterms in the two schemes at a given order . with the so - defined rs scheme we can do perturbation theory , that gives the possibility to systematically improve the resummation .    in the paper we treated only resummations of the parameters of the lagrangian .",
    "as a future prospect we should investigate momentum dependent resummations , too . to extend our ideas we should reinterpret the renormalizable theories , allowing momentum dependence of the parameters .",
    "the authors would like to thank andrs patks and jnos polonyi for useful discussions .",
