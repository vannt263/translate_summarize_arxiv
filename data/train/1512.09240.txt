    "principally driven by the modeling of geological and geophysical processes , whitehead and luther in 1975 showed that the low reynolds number , buoyant dynamics of two fluids with differing densities and viscosities could lead to the formation of stable fluid filled pipes or conduits of upwelling fluid @xcite . in 1984 , mckenzie derived a system of equations describing the dynamics of melt ( magma ) within a deformable matrix ( rock ) in the upper earth s mantle @xcite .",
    "these equations treat the magma dynamics as the flow of a low reynolds number , incompressible fluid through a more viscous , permeable matrix that is modeled as a compressible fluid due to compaction and distension .",
    "there are two model parameters @xmath47 resulting from constitutive power laws that relate the porosity to the matrix permeability and viscosity , respectively .",
    "soon after , it was realized that the asymptotically reduced , one - dimensional mckenzie equations , or magma equation , exhibits solitary wave solutions @xcite .",
    "a connection between the laboratory fluid systems explored by whitehead and luther and the magma equation was realized in @xcite where the conduit equation studied in the present work ( eq .  1 in the primary manuscript ) was derived from physical arguments , the soliton amplitude - speed relation was verified experimentally , and the approximately elastic solitonic interaction property was observed .",
    "the conduit equation corresponds exactly to the magma equation when @xmath48 .",
    "since that time , there have been a number of experimental and theoretical works on viscous fluid conduits , principally focused upon the dynamics of solitons ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is now known that the one- and two - dimensional solitary wave solutions to mckenzie s equations are unstable to transverse perturbations , leading to the formation of fully three - dimensional solitary waves @xcite .    in this work , rather than emphasize the connection to mckenzie s equations and magma dynamics , we consider the dynamics of viscous fluid conduits as a model _ dispersive hydrodynamic system _ where hydrodynamic nonlinearity is balanced by dispersive effects .",
    "such systems are plentiful in the natural world , as commented upon in the introduction of the accompanying manuscript .",
    "in addition to solitons , dispersive shock waves ( dsws ) are fundamental nonlinear excitations in dispersive hydrodynamic media ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "the first numerical studies of dsws in the mckenzie equations was undertaken by spiegelman @xcite .",
    "whitham modulation theory was later used to describe dsws in the small @xcite and large @xcite amplitude regimes of the magma and , in particular , the conduit equation .",
    "the present work represents the first experimental study of conduit dsws .",
    "the conduit experimental data are obtained by injecting through a 0.22 cm inner diameter nozzle an approximately 7:2:1 mixture of corn syrup ( karo brand light ) , water , and black food coloring ( regal brand ) into the bottom of a 2 m tall acrylic , 25.8 @xmath49 square column filled with corn syrup ( 3:2 mixture of golden barrel brand 42 dextrose equivalent and karo brand light for data of figure 2 , pure karo brand light for figures 1 , 3 , 4 ) . the fluid temperature near the top of the fluid column was measured to be @xmath50 deg c across all experimental trials . a computer controlled piston pump ( global fia milligat lf pump with microlynx controller )",
    "was used to inject fluid through a room temperature water bath followed by the nozzle .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] for an experimental schematic .",
    "when the injected fluid reaches the top of the fluid column , it pools on top of the external fluid and very slowly begins to diffuse downward .",
    "we periodically removed the pooling fluid with a syringe .",
    "steady injection results in a vertically uniform liquid filled pipe or conduit conforming to poiseuille flow @xcite .",
    "we allowed the conduit to stabilize ( straighten ) by steady injection over a period of 36 hours for the data in fig .  2 and 15 hours for the other data .        the quantitative data in fig .",
    "2 exhibits typical conduit diameters of one to four millimetres and reynolds numbers in the range re @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the intrusive fluid density",
    ". we can set the conduit diameter @xmath2 via the volumetric flow rate @xmath1 according to a hagan - poiseuille relation @xcite @xmath53 .",
    "digital images of the conduit are processed to extract the conduit diameter .",
    "the conduit edges are determined from local extrema of the differentiated grayscale intensity image using centred differences in the direction normal to the conduit interface .",
    "we confirm the poiseuille flow relation @xmath54 for the trials of fig .  2 approximately 6 cm above the fluid injection site with no fitting parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : poiseuille ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : poiseuille_high ] , we show the fit of the poiseuille flow relation to the same conduit , imaged approximately 120 cm above the injection site .",
    "the difference between the externally measured viscosity @xmath20 cp and the value @xmath21 cp from a fit to the poiseuille flow relation can be explained by the non - newtonian , thixotropic ( shear thinning ) properties of corn syrup . at the injection site ,",
    "the diluted corn syrup experiences heightened shearing , similar to our rotational viscometer measurements ( brookfield dv - i prime viscometer ) . further up the fluid column",
    ", there is less shearing so the fluid increases in viscosity and leads to a dilation of the conduit .",
    "the conduit consistently has a measured diameter in the upper fluid column that is 7% larger than its value near the injection site as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottom_top_diam ] . the results in fig .  2 of the main text use the measured value of @xmath55 and the fitted value @xmath21 cp .",

    "( solid ) with @xmath63 corresponding to a 7% increase in the conduit diameter",
    ". the lower ( upper ) diameter was measured approximately 6 cm ( 120 cm ) above the injection site . ]",
    "by adiabatically changing @xmath1 , we introduce perturbations to the conduit that subsequently propagate along the interface , allowing for the generation of conduit solitons @xcite and dsws .",
    "the injection rate profile for solitons is generated by computing a conduit solitary wave solution @xmath64 with speed @xmath65 and initial center @xmath66 to eq .",
    "this profile is converted to the dimensional diameter @xmath67 and then the volumetric flow rate profile @xmath68 , evaluated at the injection site .",
    "the volumetric flow rate profile @xmath69 that we use to create dsws is determined as follows .",
    "we initialize the dispersionless conduit equation @xmath70 with a step in conduit area from @xmath17 to 1 , left to right , at a desired distance from the nozzle @xmath71 . evolving this initial value problem backward in time results in a non - centered rarefaction wave that can be related to the volumetric flow rate profile via @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the downstream flow rate ,",
    "@xmath74 is the dimensional time , and @xmath75 is the dimensional breaking distance from the injection site . we find that this provides adequate control over the breaking location .",
    "each dsw trial in fig .",
    "2 was initiated after a sufficient waiting period , typically 5 minutes , to allow the previous trial s conduit diameter to stabilize to the expected steady value .",
    "the downstream flow rates utilized for the data in fig .  2 were nominally @xmath76 ml / min .",
    "three digital slr cameras were utilized , two canon eos 70d camers outfitted with tamron macro lenses positioned just above the injection site ( camera one ) and at approximately 120 cm above the injection site ( camera two ) .",
    "the third camera ( canon eos rebel t5i ) , outfitted with a zoom lens , was used to image the entire vertical length of 120 cm from the injection site .",
    "the fluid column was backlit with strip led lights behind lee le251r white diffusion filter paper .",
    "each dsw trial was initiated with an image of the conduit at the injection site followed by the injection protocol @xmath69 .",
    "the third camera was then set to image the full column every second throughout the trial .",
    "just after the injection protocol reached the maximum rate @xmath77 , an image of the conduit from camera 1 was taken .",
    "just prior to the arrival of the dsw leading edge within the viewing area of camera two , an image of the downstream conduit was taken , followed by a dozen or more images taken in rapid succession of the dsw leading edge .",
    "the leading edge of the dsw amplitude , normalised to the downstream area , is determined from the digital images of camera 2 without appealing to any fluid parameters .",
    "we compute the conduit edges as for the steady case , using extrema of the differentiated image intensity normal to the conduit interface .",
    "some image and edge smoothing is performed to remove pixel noise .",
    "the number of pixels across the diameter of the leading edge dsw peak is calculated and normalized by the diameter of the downstream conduit . squaring this quantity",
    "gives the leading edge dsw amplitude shown in fig .",
    "we calculated the leading edge dsw speed from the images of camera three toward the end of the trial .",
    "we nondimensionalise the speed by the characteristic speed @xmath78 , where we use the measured values of the downstream flow area @xmath79 from camera two and @xmath55 .",
    "the fitted value for @xmath32 is used , as described in the earlier section on poiseuille flow .",
    "the injected and external fluids are miscible so there is unavoidable mass diffusion across an interface between the two . using a procedure similar to that described in @xcite , we estimate the diffusion constant @xmath80 between a 7:3 corn syrup , water mixture and pure corn syrup ( karo brand light ) to be approximately @xmath81 @xmath49/s .",
    "combining this with typical flow parameters , we estimate the pclet and schmidt numbers for the trials of fig .  2 to lie in the range pe = @xmath82 and sc = pe / re @xmath83 . the advective time scale for fig .",
    "2 trials is in the range @xmath84 s. we therefore estimate that mass diffusion begins to play a role after approximately 9 hours , whereas the time scale of an experimental trial is less than 10 minutes ."
