    "the x - ray properties of accreting black hole candidates ( bhcs ) lead naturally to classification into different spectral states ( e.g. van der klis 1994 ) . in their `` high / soft '' state ,",
    "their x - ray spectra are dominated below 10 kev by a thermal blackbody - like component with temperature @xmath3 kev . in their `` low / hard '' state ,",
    "this thermal component is absent , and bhcs have powerlaw x - ray spectra .",
    "an `` intermediate '' state is also seen , in which the thermal component is weaker .",
    "individual bhcs can exhibit all spectral states , but the fraction of time spent in the different states varies considerably between objects : for example lmc x-1 has only been observed in the high / soft state , while cyg x-1 spends the majority of its time in the low / hard state .",
    "of all the persistent bhcs known , lmc x-3 is viewed through the smallest galactic column density . until recently lmc  x-3  was thought to be permanently in a high / soft state , but observations with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) have shown that lmc  x-3  changes to a low / hard state during periods of low count rate ( wilms et al .",
    "the existence of state transitions in lmc  x-3  has now been confirmed by further _ rxte _ observations ( boyd et al . 2000 ) and _ xmm - newton _  observations ( wu et al . 2001 ) .",
    "wilms et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue that the long term variability and consequent state changes could be due to an accretion disk wind - driven limit cycle ( shields et al .",
    "1986 ) .    because of the small column density in the direction of lmc  x-3 , it is the best persistent bhc in which to study the soft x - ray spectrum at a variety of spectral states .",
    "the soft x - ray spectral region is particularly important for understanding the accretion and mass transfer processes , because winds from the accretion disk , or from the companion star will imprint the soft x - ray spectrum with emission and absorption lines and edges .",
    "furthermore , the standard paradigm for the thermal component seen in the high and intermediate states of bhcs ( namely that it is the multi - temperature blackbody spectrum of an optically thick , gemoetrically thin , accretion disk ) has been poorly tested at soft x - ray energies .",
    "this is because almost all instruments on the previous generation of x - ray observatories ( i.e. before the launches of _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ ) had poor spectral resolution below 2 kev , leading to degeneracies between different spectral shapes and different amounts of absorption in spectral modelling .",
    "in this paper we present soft x - ray spectra of lmc x-3 from the _ xmm - newton _  reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) .",

    "resulting in spectra with @xmath7 channels @xmath8 m  wide , well sampled with respect to the rgs resolution of @xmath9 m  fwhm .",
    "the flux level of the april spectrum is extremely low , neccessitating very heavy binning before a respectable signal to noise ratio is achieved ; we have grouped this spectrum by a factor of 64 .",

    "the degeneracy between absorption and the intrinsic spectral shape has been a major source of uncertainty in attempts to model relatively low resolution soft x - ray spectra of bhcs ( e.g. haardt et al . 2001 ) . the excellent combination of sensitivity and resolution afforded by the _ xmm - newton _  rgs allows individual absorption edges and lines to be measured more or less independently of the underlying continuum shape , allowing a far more reliable determination of the amount of soft x - ray absorption .",

    "[ fig : allspec ] shows that this is consistently the strongest feature observed in the rgs spectra of lmc  x-3 .",
    "we have therefore used the depth of the 23    o  i k edge to determine the cold absorbing column for each of the spectra . by studying a small spectral region ( 3  to either side of the edge )",
    "we ensure that our column density determination is essentially independent of the overall continuum shape .",
    "the confidence intervals for the position of the edge and its optical depth are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pocontedge ] for all the observations excluding the very faint april observation .",
    "we have also fit the four observations simultaneously with a single set of edge parameters but with the continuum slope and normalisation allowed to vary independently for each observation .",
    "the best fit value for the simultaneous fit is shown as a cross on the confidence intervals in fig .",
    "[ fig : pocontedge ] . the edge parameters derived from each of the observations independently are consistent with the best fit edge parameters from the simultaneous fit",
    "; there is no significant change in the column density of cold material from one observation to the next .",
    "the wavelength of the edge from the simultaneous fit is @xmath10   where the confidence interval is 95% .",
    "this is consistent with the wavelength of the edge calculated by verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which is the edge wavelength used in the xspec ` tbabs ' model ( wilms , allen & mccray 2000 ) . to determine the equivalent h  i column density we substituted the ` tbabs ' model for the edge and performed another simultaneous fit to the four spectra .",
    "this results in @xmath11 @xmath1 , which is consistent with the h  i column density in the direction of lmc  x-3  as determined from radio observations ( @xmath12 @xmath1 ; nowak et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "although the column density of cold absorbing material is consistent with the interstellar medium of the galaxy , absorbing material associated with a wind from the accretion disk or the secondary star may be highly ionized by the intense x - ray and ultraviolet radiation .",
    "absorption and emission lines from warm , ionized material have now been detected in the soft x - ray band from a number of agn and x - ray binaries ( e.g. kaastra et al .",
    "2000 , brandt & schultz 2000 ) .",
    "there are no obvious emission or absorption lines present in the rgs spectra of lmc  x-3  ( figs [ fig:0030spec ] , [ fig:0045spec ] , [ fig:0092spec ] and [ fig:0176spec ] ) and so we have attempted a sensitive search for their presence .",
    "the interstellar medium and the local - group intergalactic medium have imprinted absorption lines of o  i at 23.52  and o  vii at 21.60  on the spectrum of mrk  421 ( paerels et al .",
    "2003 ) , which we have used to correct residual artifacts in the effective area calibration .",
    "therefore we performed the absorption line search on spectra which have no effective area correction .",
    "first , we calculated the transmission through the interstellar medium as a function of energy using ` tbabs ' with @xmath13 @xmath1 .",
    "we then corrected the spectra for interstellar absorption by dividing the effective area of the response matrix by the transmission .",
    "we then produced continuum spectra by smoothing our rgs spectra with a sliding box 30 pixels ( @xmath3 ) wide .",
    "we rejected any points more than 2@xmath14 deviant from the resulting smooth curve ( i.e. potential emission / absorption features ) , and repeated the smoothing .",
    "this smoothing / rejection process was iterated several times to ensure that even marginally significant discrete features do not influence its shape .",
    "we then performed a grid search for emission and absorption lines where the grid was defined in terms of central wavelength , fwhm and equivalent width .",
    "the grid values of central wavelength were chosen to oversample the wavelength bins of the data , fwhm was stepped between 0 and 1000 km s@xmath6 , with a stepsize of 200 km s@xmath6 ( well sampled at the rgs resolution ) , and the stepsize of the equivalent width was matched to the statistical uncertainty on the data .",
    "at each point in the grid , we formed a model spectrum by adding a gaussian emission / absorption line to the smooth continuum spectrum , and we computed the goodness of fit of this model to the real ( unsmoothed ) spectrum using the poisson errors on the data points and the @xmath15 statistic . the significance of any features , and limits on the equivalent width were determined using @xmath16 .",
    "since we search for lines in either emission or absorption , we expect @xmath16 to give an approximate measure of the significance of any lines ( see protassov et al .",

    "the optical photometric variability presented by brocksopp et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is also consistent with this hypothesis . in this scenario , the central x - ray source in lmc  x-3  drives a compton heated wind from the accretion disk that is sufficiently strong that it interrupts its flow of fuel .",
    "for such an instability to take place , the mass loss in the wind must exceed the accretion rate by a considerable factor ( e.g. @xmath135 , shields et al .",

    "greater than the outer radius of the accretion disk , the compton heated wind is approximately spherical ( begelman & mckee 1983 ) and so we can use equation [ eq : massloss ] to relate the mass loss rate of an accretion disk wind to the column density . taking the radius of the accretion disk to be @xmath126 cm , and the mass of the primary to be @xmath136 ( soria et al . 2001 ) , we find that an accretion disk wind capable of driving the long - term variability will have @xmath137 @xmath1 when the luminosity of the source is @xmath138 erg s@xmath6 .",

    "thus we can not rule out that the periodic variability in lmc  x-3  is driven by an accretion disk wind .",

    "however , a powerlaw , even with a photon index as hard as @xmath144 , has a softer spectral shape than a disk blackbody longward of the peak .",
    "thus for a powerlaw with @xmath145 to make a significant contribution at @xmath146  it would have to make a larger contribution at longer wavelength , and therefore the spectra should deviate significantly from the disk blackbody shape at @xmath147 .",
    "therefore the straight parallel spectra at @xmath147 , and the low best - fit photon indices , imply that the component which is observed to have a powerlaw shape at @xmath148   ( i.e. at e @xmath149 kev ) does not continue with the same powerlaw shape through the soft x - ray band .",
    "the powerlaw component is normally assumed to be the compton upscattered emission from a hot corona ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) .",
    "the compton scattered spectrum is expected to deviate from a powerlaw shape close to the energy of the seed photons .",
    "thus the absence of the powerlaw component in the soft x - ray is consistent with the seed photons for the comptonisation coming from the disk blackbody component .",
    "this is predicted by successful models for black hole binary spectral states ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1991 , haardt & maraschi 1993 , chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 , haardt et al .",
    "1997 ) , in which the temperature and optical depth of the corona depend on the amount of cooling via compton scattering off soft x - ray photons from the disk .",
    "this result is borne out by the improved fits which are obtained when the powerlaw is exchanged for a comptonised disk blackbody .",
    "however , even with this model , the photon index which describes the comptonised spectrum towards shorter wavelengths is lower than the photon indices obtained over a larger energy range using epic . furthermore , for the brightest spectra the soft x - ray flux from the comptonised component dominates the flux directly emerging from the disk .",
    "this suggests some further complexity in the spectral shape at the short wavelength end of the spectra ( the disk blackbody and comptonised components have a similar spectral shape at the long wavelength end ) .",
    "one possible explanation could be that in the soft state , the soft component in lmc  x-3  falls off slower than a disk blackbody towards short wavelengths due to electon scattering near the surface of the disk .",
    "such a broadening of the soft component spectral shape has been observed in the soft x - ray transients ( e.g. gs 2000 + 25 , gro 1655@xmath15040 ) studied by ycki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using _ ginga _ and _ rxte _ spectra .",
    "however , the rgs does not extend to short enough wavelengths for a proper investigation of this , which we defer to a future study using the epic instruments which cover a wider energy range .",
    "we have presented _ xmm - newton _  rgs spectra of lmc  x-3  covering the full range of spectral states observed in this source ( more than 3 orders of magnitude in rgs count rate ) .",
    "the spectra are completely dominated by continuum emission , and are devoid of notable spectral features except for the interstellar o  i edge .",
    "the depth of the edge is consistent between the different observations , and is consistent with the galactic interstellar column density of @xmath151 in the direction of lmc  x-3 .",
    "the upper limit to the edge depth implies @xmath152 associated with neutral o , intrinsic to lmc  x-3 .",
    "upper limits on the equivalent widths of @xmath25 resonant absorption lines from o  ii ",
    "o  viii imply @xmath153 for gas associated with partially ionized o. this implies that a line - driven stellar wind off the companion star can not supply a significant fraction of the accreting material except during the very low luminosity states .",
    "therefore the majority of accretion in lmc  x-3  probably takes place through roche lobe overflow .",
    "a multi temperature disk blackbody is a good representation of the soft x - ray spectrum of lmc  x-3  longward of the disk blackbody peak .",
    "thus the powerlaw component which dominates at higher energies does not continue through the soft x - ray range with a powerlaw shape .",
    "this suggests that the disk blackbody component supplies the seed photons which are compton upscattered to form the powerlaw at higher energies , as in conventional models for bhc spectral states .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "this work makes use of results provided by the asm / rxte teams at mit and at the rxte sof and gof at nasa s gsfc .",
