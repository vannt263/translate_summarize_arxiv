    "non - local quantum field theories ( nlqft ) have been a subject of wide research since 1950 s .",
    "the main reason for the interest in early days has been the hope that the non - local quantum field theory can provide a solution to the puzzling aspects of renormalization .",
    "the basic idea was that since the divergences in a local quantum filed theory arise from product of fields at identical space - time point , the divergences of the local quantum field theory would be tamed if the interaction were non - local .",
    "in particular , if the interaction scale was typically of the order of @xmath1 , then momenta in loop integrals ( euclidean ) would be damped when @xmath2 .",
    "the early work on nlqft , starting from that by pais and uhlenbeck @xcite and especially that of efimov and coworkers , has been summarized in @xcite .",
    "nlqft s also have found application towards description of extended particles which incorporates the symmetries of the theory in some ( non - local ) form @xcite .",
    "the non - commutative fields theories , currently being studied @xcite , are a special variant of a nlqft , as is evident especially in its qft representation using the star product . in this work",
    ", we shall focus our attention on the type of nlqft s formulated by kleppe and woodard @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons we normally insist on a * * _ local _ * * quantum field theory is because it has micro - causality , and this generally ensures causality of the theory .",
    "one of the consequences , therefore , that would be suspected of non - locality would be a causality violation at the level of the s - matrix . indeed , since at a given moment , the interaction is spread over a finite region in space , thus covering simultaneously space - like separated points , we expect the interaction to induce non - causality . in view of the fact that we have not observed large - scale causality violation ,",
    "it becomes important to distinguish between theories exhibiting * * _ classical _ * * violations of causality versus * * _ quantum _ * * violations of causality .",
    "as argued in @xcite , a violation of causality at the classical level can have a larger effective range and strength , compared to the quantum violations of causality which are suppressed by  @xmath3 per loop .",
    "we do not know of large scale causality violations , and as such , it is desirable that the non - local theory has no classical violation of causality .",
    "one way known to ensure that there is no classical level of causality violation is to require that the s - matrix of the nlqft at the tree level coincides with that of the local theory ( @xmath4 ) as is arranged in the formulation of @xcite .",
    "we shall work in the context of the nlqft s as formulated by kleppe and woodard @xcite .",
    "this form of non - local qft was evolved out of earlier work of moffat @xcite , insights into structure of non - local field equations by eliezer and woodard @xcite and application to qed by evens et al @xcite .",
    "this formulation has a distinct advantage over earlier attempts in several ways :    1 .",
    "there are no additional classical solutions to the non - local field equations compared to the local ones .",
    "the nonlocal theory is truly a deformation of the local theory and the meaning of quantization , as a perturbation about the classical , is not altered .",
    "this property is not shared by non - commutative field theories .",
    "it has the same s - matrix at the tree level , and thus ; 3 .",
    "there is no classical violation of causality .",
    "4 .   the theory , unlike a higher derivative theory , has no ghosts and is unitary at a _ finite @xmath0_. 5 .",
    "the theory can embody non - localized versions of local symmetries having an equivalent set of consequences .",
    "there are many other reasons for taking interest in these nlqft s .",
    "we have found such a non - local formulation _ with a finite @xmath0 , _ very useful in understanding the renormalization program in the renormalizable field theories @xcite .",
    "we have shown that this formulation enables one to construct a mathematically consistent framework in which the renormalization program can be understood in a natural manner .",
    "the framework does not require any violations of mathematical rigor usually associated with the renormalization program .",
    "this framework , moreover , made it possible to theoretically estimate the mass scale @xmath0 .",
    "the nonlocal formulations can also be understood @xcite as an effective field theory formulation of a physical theory that is valid up to mass scale @xmath5@xmath0 .",
    "in such a case , the unknown physics at energy scales higher than @xmath0 [ such as a structure in terms of finer constituents , additional particles , forces , supersymmetry etc ] can _ effectively be represented _ in a _ consistent _ way ( a unitary , gauge - invariant , finite ( or renormalizable ) theory ) by the non - local theory . in other words ,",
    "the nonlocal standard model can serve as such an effective field theory @xcite and will afford a model - independent way of consistently reparametrizing the effects beyond standard model .",
    "it can be looked upon in a number of other ways .",
    "one could think the non - locality as representing a form factor with a momentum cut - off @xmath0@xcite .",
    "one could also think of this theory as embodying a granularity of space - time of the scale @xmath1 or as an intrinsic mass scale @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "+ a possible  \" limitation  \" of the theory is that the theory necessarily has quantum violations of causality @xcite ; though it can be interpreted as a prediction of the theory . in another work ,",
    "a. jain and one of us explored the question with the help of the simple calculations for the simplest field theory : the nonlocal version of the @xmath6 theory @xcite .",
    "while , in this scalar field model , the causality violation is related to the nonlocality of interaction put in by hand , so to speak , in practice such a non - locality of interaction could arise from many possible sources .",
    "it could arise from a fundamental length , @xmath1 , present in nature .",
    "it could arise from composite nature of elementary particles ( this possibility has recently been explored @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we wish to formulate how the effect can be observed experimentally . in order to study causality violation ( cv ) in the theory ,",
    "it is first necessary to formulate quantities that signal cv .",
    "we would like to construct quantities that can be * * _ measured _ * * experimentally .",
    "from this view - point , it is appropriate to construct quantities in terms of the s - operator . bogoliubov and shirkov @xcite have formulated a * * _ necessary _ * * condition for causality to be preserved in particle physics by the s - operator .",
    "this formulation is simple and at the same time extremely general in that , it uses only ( i ) the phenomenologically accessible s - operator together with ( ii ) the most basic notion of causality in a relativistic formulation : a cause at @xmath7 shall not affect physics at any point @xmath8 unless @xmath8 is in the forward light - cone with respect to @xmath7 .",

    ", we shall give the results for the exclusive processes @xmath13 in the one loop order from @xcite .",
    "in section 3 , we make a comparison of the local contribution and the non - local cv effects and the latter could be significant for @xmath14 and when one analyzes angular distributions . in section 4",
    ", we shall construct a physical observable in terms of a differential cross - section @xmath15 .",
    "this quantity involves some higher order terms and in section 6 , we shall make an estimate of them and show that under certain conditions on coupling constant and energies they are indeed negligible and allow observation of the observable constructed in section 3 .    while , what we have presented for simplicity , is a model calculation , similar attempt can be made for a more realistic process in the standard model",

    "the procedure constructs an action having an infinite number of terms ( each individually local ) , and having arbitrary order derivatives of @xmath19 .",
    "the net result is to give convergence in the * * _ euclidean _ * * momentum space beyond a momentum scale @xmath0 through a factor of the form @xmath35 in propagators .",
    "the construction is such that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the solutions of the local and the non - local classical field equations , ( a difficult task indeed @xcite ) .",
    "it can also be made to preserve the local symmetries of the local action in a non - localized form @xcite .",
