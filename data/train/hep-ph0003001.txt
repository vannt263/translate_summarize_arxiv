    "qcd at finite temperature and zero density condition is relatively well understood compared the finite density situation .",
    "the technical reasons are well known .",
    "physically , quantum decoherence increases as temperature gets high making the behaviour of the system essentially classical .",
    "on the other hand , density effects do not reduce quantum coherence .",
    "one has to deal with the quantum effects .",
    "a brief review is given here about the current status of our understanding of the role played by the color superconducting phase in the strong interaction ground state close to zero density and in hadron structure .",
    "the ground state of qcd at high enough density is most likely to be in a color superconducting phase .",
    "this is because quarks on a high fermi surface carry high momentum and produce large momentum transfer in scattering , so that the two quark interaction kernel in color triplet channel can be approximated well by an attractive one gluon exchange term .",
    "the attractive interaction generates the bcs instability that creates a gap of order @xmath0 with @xmath1 a constant .",
    "the properties of the color superconducting phase are actively studied in the recent literature base on various approaches like the instanton model , the one gluon exchange approximation improved by renormalization group treatment and the contact 4-fermion interaction model .",
    "no matter what models are adopted for the discussion , the fact that color superconducting phase should be the ground state of the high density quark matter is quite clear according to well established bcs theory for superconductivity in non - relativistic condensed matter systems .",
    "a gap of order of a few 100 mev is guaranteed at not so high density since the natural scale of the problem is of order 1 gev and the coupling between quarks is of order 1 .",
    "otherwise , fine tuning is required .",
    "the general consensus on the properties of the color superconducting phase of quark matter at asymptotically high density and zero temperature is that the ground state is in a color flavor locked state involving up , down and strange quarks .",
    "as the density is lowered , the color flavor locked state ceases to be the true ground state of the system , the true ground state is in a color superconducting phase involves only the up and down quarks .",
    "such a color superconducting phase is again disfavoured as the density is further lowered to some critical density @xmath2 .",
    "the color superconducting phase stops to manifest at a macroscopic scale when @xmath3 .",
    "the current estimate of @xmath2 is so high that the physical effects of the color superconducting phase can only be possible to manifest in a neutron star in the conventional understanding of the problem based mainly on the physical picture gained in the study of non - relativistic many body systems .",
    "since there are already reviews on this subject@xcite at high density , i shall mainly concentrate on a brief review of my own efforts in the past 10 years ( 1989 - 1999 ) , which actually started the study of vacuum color superconductivity .",
    "i however looked at the problem with a different perspective .",
    "what is the fate of the color superconducting phase at low density then ?",
    "one thing is quite clear that the attraction between quark pairs in a color triplet state still exist .",
    "it is evidenced by the existence of baryons which are made up of three quarks .",
    "one of the reasons besides confinement for the color superconducting phase to disappear at low density is due to the competition from the quark ",
    "antiquark pairing .",
    "since as the density is lowered , the antiquark excitation due to interaction becomes less suppressed .",
    "a sufficient number of the interaction generated antiquarks begin to pair with the quarks of the system to condense in the ground state , which cause the well know spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .    in order to study the phase and the neighbourhood of the strong interaction vacuum state , the present framework of finite density theory based on non - relativistic space - time is found to be inadequate .",
    "inconsistencies in the logic flow of physical argumentation and unphysical solution occur when one goes beyond the quasi - particle picture .",
    "thus not only the kinematics of individual particles has to be relativistic , but also the covariance related to the relativistic space - time transformation for the whole system at the quantum field level has to be implemented in a way that is consistent to quantum mechanics .    the results of the efforts include : 1 ) the model building and studying for vector@xcite and scalar@xcite diquark condensation and many of the technical development@xcite 2 ) the introduction of an 8component real representation for fermions@xcite , which is not identical to the conventional 4-component representation at finite density@xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the 8component theory to study the vacuum properties is discussed .",
    "it also enable me to isolate some of the differences near zero density between my work and the later commonly adopted ones@xcite which contain a continuous mixing between the color superconducting phase and the chiral symmetry breaking phase in the parameter space where no metastable phase is found .",
    "the difference originates from a different coupling between quarks in the diquarks . while the `` reality condition '' adopted here requires that quark and mirror quark are correlated to condense , other approaches couple quark and mirror antiquark for the correlated diquarks@xcite , which can naturally be mixed with the chiral symmetry breaking phase .",
    "such a difference disappear at high density .",
    "3 ) the possibility that the effects of a metastable phase can manifest in local observables and propagators @xcite 4 ) the development of a consistent local finite density theory@xcite , which combines all of the above considerations .",
    "the effects of statistical blocking in the chiral symmetry breaking phase and the spontaneous cp violation in the color superconducting phase was discovered as a result@xcite .",
    "also discussed is the dynamics of the statistical gauge field in various phases .",
    "it is believed that the statistical blocking effects could provide a mechanism@xcite to prevent the dissolution of a nucleon inside a nucleus@xcite , which is in direct contradiction to the experimental fact that a nucleon inside a nucleus keeps most of its identity .",
    "is what are talked about above correspond to reality ? to answer it , some of the empirical knowledge about a nucleon , which serves as a carrier of the information about the virtual phase of the vacuum state , are analyzed .",
    "the chiral properties of a nucleon is studied@xcite , to search for a vector type of virtual color superconducting phase .",
    "there are some hints .",
    "more detailed works are needed .",
    "the recent discovery of a large anapole moment for a nucleon@xcite that can not be accounted for by conventional electroweak theory@xcite may also be a hint for a vector type virtual color superconducting phase since the order parameter here breaks parity which can induce an axial type of coupling for a photon to a nucleon@xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic properties of a nucleon is studied next base on the mechanism of partial breaking of the electromagnetic gauge symmetry@xcite in a color superconductor .",
    "the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule , which is currently unable to be saturated by experimental data , is a possible observable for both scalar and vector type of color superconducting phase@xcite .",
    "a collection deep inelastic scattering data for a lepton on a nucleon is analyzed , the results , especially the measured polarized structure function for a nucleon at small bjorken x , indicates the existence of a virtual superconducting phase@xcite . other evidences , which is less model independent , is also considered@xcite . in the near future , at least two possibile developements",
    "could be foreseen : 1 ) the nucleon @xmath4term problem , which is made worse by the analysis @xcite of most recent data on pion nucleon scattering , could be resolved @xcite by using the local theory developed here @xcite 2 ) type of the cp / t violation data obtained in the ktev collaboration should be analyzed@xcite in more details to search@xcite for possible anomalies .",
