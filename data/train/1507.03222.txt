    "both the atlas and the cms collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have discovered a new gauge boson whose properties are compatible with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "this discovery has initiated a new era of precision studies of the higgs - boson properties . among the higgs - boson decay channels",
    ", the decay @xmath8 plays an important role in higgs phenomenology . the next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "@xcite , the next - to - next - leading order ( n@xmath9lo )  @xcite , and the next - to - next - to - next - leading order ( n@xmath10lo )  @xcite qcd corrections to the total decay width @xmath0 under the modified minimal subtraction scheme ( @xmath11-scheme ) have been done in the literature .",
    "those improvements provide us great chances for achieving precise perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions on @xmath0 .",
    "a key problem in making precise pqcd prediction is how to set the renormalization scale of the running coupling .",
    "conventionally , the total decay width @xmath0 is predicted by choosing the higgs mass @xmath12 as the renormalization scale and by varying it within a certain range , such as @xmath13 $ ] , to ascertain its uncertainty .",
    "however , at any finite order , such a simple choice of scale leads to the well - known renormalization scheme - and - scale ambiguities .",
    "there are also uncanceled large logarithms as well as the  renormalon \" terms in the high - orders that diverge as ( @xmath14 ) , which can give sizable contributions to the theoretical estimation and dilute the pqcd convergence .",
    "schematically , one can express the total decay width @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 stands for the tree - level or the leading - order ( lo ) decay width .",
    "it has been shown that the qcd correction factor @xmath18 under the @xmath4-scheme follows the trends  @xcite @xmath19 which shows that the nlo and the n@xmath9lo corrections are about @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the born term , indicating a slow pqcd convergence under the @xmath4-scheme . moreover , as will be shown later , there are large scale uncertainties for each loop terms under the conventional scale - setting .",
    "it is thus helpful to find a proper scale - setting approach to achieve a more reliable pqcd prediction .",
    "a guiding principle for resolving the renormalization scheme - and - scale ambiguities is that physical results must be independent of theoretical conventions .",
    "as has been argued in refs.@xcite , if one fixes the renormalization scale of pqcd series using principle of maximum conformality ( pmc ) , all non - conformal @xmath2-terms in pqcd series are then resummed into the running coupling , and one thus obtains a unique , scale - fixed , and scheme - independent prediction at any finite order .",
    "the pmc has a solid theoretical foundation , satisfying the renormalization group invariance  @xcite and all other self - consistency conditions from renormalization group equation ( rge )  @xcite .",
    "the pmc provides the general procedure underlies the commensurate scale relations  @xcite , which ensures the scheme independence of the predictions under various schemes .",
    "a demonstration of the scheme independence at any fixed - order has been given with the help of @xmath22-scheme  @xcite , a systematic generalization of the minimal subtraction renormalization scheme .",
    "the pmc reduces in abelian limit to the standard gell - mann - low scale - setting method used in qed  @xcite .",
    "the pmc has been successfully applied to many high - energy processes , cf",
    ". a recent review on the importance of proper renormalization scale - setting for qcd testing at high - energy colliders  @xcite , which can also be applied to processes with multiple physical scales  @xcite . in the paper",
    ", we shall adopt the pmc with the goal of eliminating the renormalization scale ambiguity and achieving a more accurate pqcd prediction .",
    "a pmc analysis of the decay @xmath8 under the @xmath11-scheme has been done in ref.@xcite .",
    "the pqcd convergence of this process can not be greatly improved as the usual pmc applications , especially its @xmath23lo contribution is still about @xmath24 of the total decay width , indicating there is somewhat larger residual scale dependence .",
    "however , it is noted that the simple pmc analysis done in ref.@xcite could be inaccurate .",
    "this is because that the present process involves the three - gluon vertex at the lowest order , thus the scale - setting problem should be much more involved  @xcite .",
    "only those @xmath2-terms that are pertained to the renormalization of running coupling should be absorbed into the running coupling so as to achieve the optimal scales at each perturbative order .",
    "thus , special treatment , though difficult , should be paid for distributing the @xmath2-terms of the process , which is lacking in ref.@xcite .",
    "to avoid such ambiguity of applying the pmc , we shall first transform the results from the @xmath4-scheme to the momentum space subtraction scheme ( mom - scheme )  @xcite , which is based on renormalization of the triple - gluon vertex at some symmetric off - shell momentum , and then apply the pmc scale - setting . unlike the @xmath11-scheme , the physical mom - scheme carries information of the vertex at specific momentum configuration .",
    "this external momentum configuration is non - exceptional and there are no infrared issues , thus avoiding the confusion of distinguishing @xmath2-terms . in the literature , as an alternation of the mom - scheme , the minimal momentum space subtraction scheme ( mmom - scheme ) has also been suggested  @xcite , which is an extension of the mom - scheme on the ghost - gluon vertex and allows the strong running coupling to be fixed solely through a determination of the gluon and ghost propagators .",
    "the mmom - scheme can be related to the @xmath4-scheme at four - loop level , thus the four - loop mmom @xmath25-function can be determined with the help of the relations between mmom and @xmath4-couplings  @xcite .",
    "this four - loop mmom @xmath25-function can then be adopted to get the four - loop mmom - scheme @xmath3-running behavior and well suit the needs for our present four - loop analysis .",
    "using the pmc under the mom - scheme has already been suggested by refs.@xcite to deal with qcd bfkl pomeron .",
    "those papers show that after applying the pmc , the qcd perturbative convergence can be greatly improved and the bfkl pomeron intercept has a weak dependence on the virtuality of the reggeized gluon , resulting a much better agreement with the experimental data in comparison to the @xmath4-prediction . in those references ,",
    "the nlo transition of the @xmath4-scheme to the mom - scheme has been explained . at present , we shall provide a higher - order treatment of such scheme transition and present the pmc formulas under the mmom - scheme up to four - loop level .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] , we present the technology for calculating the total decay width @xmath0 under the mmom - scheme up to four - loop level . the behavior of the running coupling under mmom - scheme is presented . numerical results and discussions",

    "[ sect4 ] . for convenience",

    ", we shall transform the pqcd expressions for the decay @xmath8 under the @xmath11-scheme into those of the mmom - scheme by using the relation of running coupling between the @xmath11-scheme and the mmom - scheme .",
    "the mom - scheme is gauge dependent , and three gauges as landau gauge ( @xmath26 ) , feynman gauge ( @xmath27 ) and fried - yennie gauge ( @xmath28 ) are adopted in the literature , where @xmath29 stands for the gauge parameter .",
    "the question is much more involved when the gauge parameter @xmath30 , especially the following suggested extended renormalization group method can not be directly applied and some alterations must be done to obtain a smooth scheme transformation among different running couplings  .",
    "for definiteness , we shall adopt the landau gauge ( @xmath26 ) to do our calculation .",
    "the scale - running behavior of the running coupling is controlled by the renormalization group equation or the @xmath25-function @xmath31 where the symbol  a \" stands for an arbitrary renormalization scheme , @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the strong running coupling under the @xmath34-scheme .    by taking the same integral constant as that of refs.@xcite , the solution of eq.([rge_a ] ) over the power series of @xmath35 can be written as ,    @xmath36 + \\beta_0^a \\beta_2^a \\right ] \\frac{1}{{\\beta_0^a}^4 { l_a}^2 } \\right .",

    "the @xmath39-functions under the @xmath40-scheme can be found in refs.@xcite . under the landau gauge ,",
    "the @xmath39-functions under the mmom - scheme up to four - loop level are  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for the number of active flavors .",
    "thus the @xmath3-running is fixed if we know the asymptotic parameter @xmath43 well , whose value can be determined by using its relation to @xmath44 .",
    "it is noted that both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the same as those of @xmath11-scheme , then , we can apply the extended renormalization group method suggested by ref.@xcite to evolve the @xmath47-running coupling @xmath48 at the scale @xmath49  adiabatically \" into the @xmath50-running coupling @xmath51 at the scale @xmath52 not only in scale but also in scheme .",
    "thus a more reasonable and accurate perturbative expansion of @xmath53 over @xmath48 can be achieved  @xcite .",

    "the first equation ( [ lamda1 ] ) is derived from a two - loop comparison , which equals to the one given by refs.@xcite that is derived via a different approach . as a byproduct",
    ", those relations could be treated inversely as a consistency check of the complex high - order coefficients @xmath63 calculated in the literature .",
    "for example , the equivalence of eq.([lamda1 ] ) and eq.([lamda2 ] ) can be used as a cross - check of the correctness of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .      under the usual @xmath11-scheme",

    "the non - conformal @xmath75-terms determine the optimal behavior of the running coupling via rge .",
    "after applying the pmc , i.e. by absorbing / resumming all @xmath75-terms into the running coupling , the pqcd series ( [ fmominit ] ) can be finally simplified into the following scheme - independent conformal series : @xmath81 here @xmath82 stands for the pmc scale at each perturbative order , whose values are determined by rge and are usually different at different orders . up to four - loop qcd corrections , the lo pmc scale @xmath83 , the nlo pmc scale @xmath84 and the @xmath23lo pmc scale @xmath85 are    @xmath86    at the four - loop level , the n@xmath10lo pmc scale @xmath87 is undetermined due to unknown higher - order @xmath75-terms , and we set its value as the latest determined pmc scale @xmath85 . after applying the pmc , there are two kinds of residual scale dependence .",
    "the pmc scales are in perturbative series such that to eliminate all known non - conformal @xmath25-terms properly via rge .",

    "generally , those two residual scale dependence are highly suppressed , and the conventional renormalization scale uncertainty to the total and individual decay widths at each order can thus be greatly suppressed .",
    ".the asymptotic scales @xmath88 and @xmath89 at different loop - levels under the @xmath4-scheme and the mmom - scheme . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a comparison , we present the pmc prediction for the total and individual decay widths under the mmom - scheme in table [ widthpmc ] , in which the results are given by taking @xmath90 @xmath91 , @xmath12 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",

    "moreover , the renormalization scale errors for the individual decay widths @xmath96 have also been greatly suppressed by pmc scale - setting , e.g. except for the nlo ratio @xmath97 , all other @xmath98 are less than @xmath99 by varying @xmath69 within the region of @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that after applying the pmc , we can fix the @xmath3-running behavior , or equivalently the renormalization scale , at each perturbative order via the using of rge .",

    "those optimal pmc scales are smaller than the conventional choice of scale @xmath102 to a certain degree .",
    "fig.([scalesq1q2q3 ] ) shows that the pmc scales @xmath101 are highly independent on the choice of @xmath69 , and their values are almost fixed to be @xmath103 this explains why the individual decay widths at each order and the total decay width are highly independent to the initial choice of scale .",
    "thus the conventional scale ambiguity is cured .",

    "this way , the pmc scales can be improved when more - and - more qcd loop corrections are considered , and the unknown higher - order @xmath75-terms shall lead to residual scale dependence . in principal ,",
    "as shown by refs.@xcite , due to both the @xmath3-power suppression and the exponential - suppression , such residual scale dependence is negligible . for the present case",
