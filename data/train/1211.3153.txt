    "hence , it is quite promising to determine the leptonic dirac cp - violating phase @xmath1 by comparing the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos in future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath28-scale neutrino telescopes ( e.g. , icecube and km3net ) could provide us with useful and complementary information about leptonic cp violation by precisely measuring the flavor composition of ultrahigh - energy astrophysical neutrinos @xcite . if the deep core of the icecube detector is made denser to lower the energy threshold down to a few @xmath29 , such as the proposal pingu @xcite , a large amount of atmospheric neutrino events can be collected and used to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and perhaps the leptonic cp - violating phase @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a lot of neutrino mass models based on discrete flavor symmetries or phenomenological assumptions have recently been proposed to describe the observed leptonic mixing pattern , in particular a relatively large @xmath0 .",

    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( 7 ) that the evolution of @xmath1 is entangled with that of three mixing angles and two majorana cp - violating phases . in particular , it depends crucially on the majorana phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it has been found that the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath1 can be radiatively generated from @xmath12 and @xmath13 , even if the initial value of @xmath1 is vanishing @xcite . on the other hand , the rg evolution of @xmath1 becomes negligible when @xmath104 , while the mixing angle @xmath10 is quite sensitive to the rg effect in this case . * the rge s of @xmath1 in the sm , the mssm , and the uedm are given by the same formula in eq .",

    "if we take @xmath109 to be a unitary matrix @xmath69 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , then @xmath113 can be obtained .",
    "this observation together with eq .",
    "( 5 ) leads to the identity @xmath114 . however , this identity depends on the specific parametrization of @xmath69 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath115 with @xmath116 being the dirac cp - violating phase , then we have @xmath117 , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we proceed in this subsection with the numerical solution to the rge of the leptonic dirac cp - violating phase @xmath1 .",
    "since the evolution of @xmath1 in the sm is negligible even in the case of a nearly - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum , we consider only the mssm and the uedm .",
    "note that no approximations to the rge of @xmath1 will be made in our numerical calculations .",
    "our numerical results are shown in fig . 1 , and",
    "the main points are summarized as follows .    in the mssm , we have taken two typical values of @xmath118 and @xmath119 for illustration . in both cases , the absolute neutrino mass @xmath120 is assumed , which is consistent with the cosmological bound @xmath121 ( @xmath122 c.l . ) from the wmap collaboration @xcite . for the initial values of @xmath1 at the electroweak scale ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 as typical examples .",
    "since the tau - lepton yukawa coupling is given by @xmath123 in the mssm , the evolution of @xmath1 should be significantly enhanced for a large value of @xmath5 , as shown in the upper plots of fig .  1 .",
    "for @xmath119 , the rg running of @xmath1 is quite significant . in particular , even if @xmath124 is found at the low - energy scale , namely , there is no cp - violating effect in neutrino oscillation experiments , the maximal cp - violating phase @xmath125 or @xmath4 can be achieved at the cutoff scale @xmath126 .",
    "in other words , one can change from the scenario with a zero cp - violating phase to that with a maximal cp - violating phase , or vice versa . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the radiative correction to @xmath1 is at most @xmath127 even at @xmath126 .    in the uedm",
    ", we have input two different values of the absolute neutrino mass @xmath120 and @xmath128 . as shown in the lower plots of fig .  1",
    ", @xmath1 is rather stable against radiative corrections for @xmath120 . even for @xmath128 , which is marginally in tension with the cosmological bound ,",
    "the relative change of @xmath1 at the cutoff scale @xmath129 is not larger than @xmath127 .",
    "the cutoff scale @xmath129 in the uedm has been chosen to avoid the landau pole , where the higgs mass is @xmath130 and @xmath131 with @xmath132 being the radius of the compactified extra dimension .",
    "since the valid energy range in the uedm is much smaller than that in the mssm , the rg running does not develop as much .",
    "however , it should be noted that the rg running in uedm is actually in the form of a power law , and thus can be more significant than in the sm and in the mssm .     for majorana neutrinos in the mssm ( upper plots ) and in the uedm ( lower plots ) .",
    "the initial values @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 are assumed , while the majorana cp - violating phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 are marginalized .",
    "the values of @xmath10 , @xmath0 , @xmath11 and @xmath136 , @xmath98 in the @xmath33 ranges from the global - fit analysis ( for @xmath25 ) have been used as input @xcite.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    it should also be noted that the majorana cp - violating phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 have been marginalized over the range @xmath137 in our numerical results .",
    "if the specific values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are chosen , the variation of @xmath1 will be even smaller .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the leptonic dirac cp - violating phase @xmath1 is stable against radiative corrections in all the models under consideration , except for the mssm with a large value of @xmath138 . in comparison , the dirac cp - violating phase in the quark sector is stable even in the mssm with a large value of @xmath138 , since the quark mass spectrum is strongly hierarchical .",

    "in the upper plots of fig .  2 , the allowed regions of @xmath1 at the superhigh - energy scale have been given in the mssm .",
    "in the case of @xmath119 , one can observe that @xmath1 is almost arbitrary within @xmath144 due to the large uncertainty of the input , so any predictions for @xmath1 from a high - energy flavor model could be made consistent with the low - energy observations by the rg running .",
    "this is true for the global - fit results from both groups @xcite . in reality ,",
    "any observable effects of cp violation should be related to the jarlskog invariant @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , we also show the rg running of @xmath139 in the mssm for @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , in the lower plots of fig .",
    "it can be observed that @xmath139 at a superhigh - energy scale could be quite different from that at the low - energy scale , in particular for @xmath149 and @xmath142 .",
    "the possibility for neutrinos to be dirac particles has never been experimentally excluded .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the leptogenesis mechanism responsible for the matter - antimatter asymmetry in our universe also works well in a different way for dirac neutrinos @xcite .",
    "hence , we assume neutrinos to be dirac particles , and give them masses through the coupling to the higgs doublet @xmath150 with @xmath151 being the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix .",

    "the relative error in the above equation is at the level of @xmath158 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the last term in eq .",
    "( 10 ) is comparable in magnitude to the second term , since the suppression by a factor of @xmath159 is compensated by the enhancement from @xmath160 .",
    "some general comments are in order :    * the evolution of @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath161 at all orders , so @xmath1 will be kept unchanged by the rg running if @xmath162 , namely , @xmath163 or @xmath124 . in other words ,",
    "if leptonic cp violation is absent at low energies , it will never be generated by rg running .",
    "this is quite different from the majorana case , where @xmath1 can be radiatively generated via the non - vanishing majorana cp - violating phases even if @xmath31 or @xmath124 has been used as an initial condition .",
    "* two qualitative differences between the sm and the mssm should be noted .",
    "first , the tau - yukawa coupling @xmath164 in the mssm is significantly enhanced for a large value of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the rg effect is more remarkable than that in the sm .",
    "second , the coefficient @xmath155 takes opposite signs in the sm and in the mssm , indicating the evolution of @xmath1 in opposite directions in these two models .     for dirac neutrinos in the mssm for @xmath118 ( left plot ) and @xmath119 ( right plot ) .",
    "the initial values @xmath133 and @xmath135 are assumed , and the values of @xmath10 , @xmath0 , @xmath11 and @xmath136 , @xmath98 in the @xmath33 ranges from the global - fit analysis ( for @xmath25 ) have been used as input @xcite.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]     ( upper and middle plots ) and the jarlskog invariant @xmath165 ( lower plots ) for dirac neutrinos at @xmath33 c.l . with @xmath140 ( dark red or dark gray ) , @xmath141 ( light red or gray ) and @xmath142 ( yellow or light gray ) in the mssm .",

    "@xcite for the right column.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    to illustrate the rg running behavior of @xmath1 in the dirac neutrino case , we have shown in fig .",
    "3 two typical examples in the mssm . in both examples ,",
    "the initial values of @xmath1 have been taken to be @xmath166 and @xmath4 , and the absolute neutrino mass is @xmath120 .",
    "the left plot is for @xmath118 , while the right for @xmath119 .",
    "note that the beta function of @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath167 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , where @xmath168 in the mssm . therefore , @xmath1 increases for @xmath169 , while it decreases for @xmath2 , as the energy scale evolves towards higher energies .",
    "this feature can be clearly observed in fig .",
    "3 . furthermore",
    ", the variation of @xmath1 at any energy scale is quite small , compared to that in the case of majorana neutrinos , where the arbitrary majorana cp - violating phases play an important role in the evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , @xmath1 will be kept unchanged if the initial values lead to @xmath162 , so the trivial cases of @xmath170 and @xmath124 have not been considered .",
    "now , we continue with the global - fit results of @xmath1 in refs .  @xcite as initial values .",
    "the rg running of @xmath1 in the mssm for @xmath171 and @xmath142 have been shown in the upper and middle plots of fig .  4 , respectively .",
    "as before , the absolute neutrino mass @xmath172 is assumed . in the former case ,",
    "the rg running effects are insignificant , which is in accordance with the results in fig .  3 .",
    "in the latter case , however , it is interesting to note that a wide range of values @xmath173 $ ] can not be reached at the superhigh - energy scale @xmath174 , no matter what initial value of @xmath1 is chosen .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the mixing angle @xmath0 is approaching zero around @xmath175 . in the limit of an extremely small value of @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( 8) can be written as @xmath176 where @xmath168 has been chosen for the mssm .",
    "therefore , the rg running of @xmath1 will be rapidly accelerated around @xmath175 to the large - value region for @xmath177 ( i.e. , @xmath178 ) , while to the small - value region for @xmath179 ( i.e. , @xmath180 ) .",
    "this observation applies also to any initial value of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , we have numerically checked the whole parameter region of @xmath181 at low energies , and found that only @xmath182 $ ] and @xmath183 can be reached at high energies .",
    "however , the exact allowed range of @xmath1 at high - energy scales really depends on the initial values of @xmath1 and three mixing angles . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the rg running of @xmath1 will be absent , but @xmath0 becomes negative above @xmath184 , so we have to redefine @xmath185 to make @xmath0 positive , leading to @xmath31 or @xmath186 at high - energy scales . in the lower plots of fig .",
    "4 , the evolution of the jarlskog invariant @xmath139 is shown .",
    "unlike the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath1 itself , the physical observable @xmath165 evolves smoothly over the whole range of energy scales , as it should . for @xmath142",
    ", the value of @xmath187 can initially be as large as @xmath188 , it becomes vanishingly small at @xmath174 .",
    "one reason for this is that @xmath1 shrinks into a small region around @xmath52 or @xmath186 at the high - energy scale , as indicated in the middle plots of fig .",
    "4 . obviously",
    ", the evolution of the three mixing angles is also relevant here .",
    "in secs .",
    "ii and iii , we have examined the rg running behaviors of the leptonic dirac cp - violating phase @xmath1 in the cases of majorana neutrinos and dirac neutrinos , respectively .",
    "now , we compare these two cases and summarize the main differences :    * in the majorana case , the two majorana cp - violating phases are playing a crucial role in the rg running of @xmath1 .",
    "one can start from a cp - conserving scenario with @xmath31 or @xmath3 at the low - energy scale , and end up with a cp - violating scenario even with @xmath2 or @xmath4 . in the dirac case , the evolution of @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath161 , so the cp conservation at the low - energy scale definitely implies that cp violation is absent at a superhigh - energy scale . * the mixing angle @xmath0 could approach zero at some high - energy scale @xmath189 in both cases if a large value of @xmath5 is assumed in the mssm .",
    "on the other hand , there exist in the rge s of @xmath1 some terms inversely proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the rg running behavior of @xmath1 will be dramatically changed around @xmath189 .",
    "given the global - fit values of @xmath1 within the @xmath33 range , it turns out that @xmath1 could be arbitrary at the high - energy scale in the majorana case due to the marginalization over @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the dirac case , @xmath1 is found to be in two narrow ranges @xmath190 $ ] or @xmath183 in the mssm with @xmath142 .",
    "however , if a concrete mass model for majorana neutrinos or dirac neutrinos is assumed , the rg running of @xmath1 may depend on the model details .",
    "in particular , when new particles or interactions come into play at some intermediate energy scale , the rge s of the neutrino parameters are completely changed @xcite .",
    "hence , we have assumed that this is not the case in the previous discussions , at least below the cutoff scale .    as we have mentioned before",
    ", many flavor symmetry models , which are intended for describing the observed leptonic mixing angles , predict the leptonic dirac cp - violating phase @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath191 ( or @xmath192 ) and @xmath193 ( or @xmath194 ) for different breaking patterns of the @xmath195 flavor symmetry in the type - i seesaw model , where three heavy right - handed neutrino singlets are introduced to realize the dimension - five weinberg operator .",
    "if the vacuum alignment problem is further solved in the framework of supersymmetry , significant radiative corrections to these theoretical predictions of @xmath1 could be possible .",
    "thus , the leptonic dirac cp - violating phase to be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments is related by the rg running to the theoretical prediction at the seesaw scale . on the other hand , the cp - violating and out - of - equilibrium decays of the heavy right - handed neutrinos",
    "can generate the lepton number asymmetry in the early universe , which will be converted into the baryon number asymmetry via the sm sphaleron processes . in this case , the leptonic cp violation in neutrino oscillations can be associated with the matter - antimatter asymmetry in our universe .",
    "thanks to the recent measurements of @xmath0 in the daya bay and reno experiments , the discovery of cp violation in neutrino oscillation experiments seems to be promising if the leptonic cp violation really exists and the leptonic dirac cp - violating phase @xmath1 happens to be far away from @xmath52 or @xmath3 . on the other hand , we have already had a preliminary result for the leptonic cp - violating phase @xmath1 from the global - fit analysis of all kinds of neutrino oscillation experiments , namely @xmath32 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are well motivated to study the rg running of @xmath1 from the low - energy scale to a superhigh - energy scale , where a unified model for fermion masses , flavor mixing , and cp violation is expected .    in the case of majorana neutrinos , we have introduced the dimension - five weinberg operator to account for neutrino masses .",
    "the rge of @xmath1 has been derived analytically in great detail for the sm , the mssm , and the uedm , and a self - consistent approximation to it has been given as well . by a self - consistent approximation ,",
    "we mean that the rge of @xmath1 has been expanded in terms of @xmath92 and @xmath159 , and all the terms of the same order of magnitude should be preserved .",
    "it turns out that @xmath1 is rather stable against radiative corrections in all these models , except for the case of a large @xmath5 in the mssm ( e.g. , @xmath119 together with a nearly degenerate neutrino mass spectrum ) . in this case",
    ", the majorana cp - violating phases play an important role in the evolution of @xmath1 such that a maximal phase @xmath2 or @xmath4 can be radiatively generated at a superhigh - energy scale even if @xmath124 ( i.e. , no cp - violating effects in neutrino oscillation experiments ) at the low - energy scale .",
