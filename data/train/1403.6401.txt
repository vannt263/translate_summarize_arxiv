    "<S> we establish a resonance free strip for codimension 2 symplectic normally hyperbolic trapped sets with smooth incoming / outgoing tails . </S>",

    "<S> this paper is a collection of results regarding resonance free strips ( also known as _ spectral gaps _ ) and resolvent estimates in the presence of _ normally hyperbolic trapping_. such trapping has received a lot of attention recently because of its connection with exponential decay of waves on black hole backgrounds , exponential decay of correlations for contact anosov flows , and applications to molecular chemistry . </S>",

    "<S> in  @xcite , wunsch and zworski showed existence of a small spectral gap for symplectic normally hyperbolic trapped sets under the assumption that the incoming / outgoing tails @xmath2 are smooth and have codimension 1 in the phase space ; this includes subextremal kerr and kerr  de sitter black holes . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , nonnenmacher and zworski  @xcite extended this result by ( a ) assuming much weaker regularity of @xmath2 , namely that their tangent spaces at the trapped set have merely continuous dependence on the base point ( b ) making no assumption on the codimension of @xmath2 ( c ) establishing the optimal size of the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the assumptions of  @xcite apply to more general situations , including contact anosov flows .    </S>",
    "<S> the first result of this paper ( theorem  [ t : gap1 ] ) is a spectral gap of optimal size under the assumptions of  @xcite ( and the orientability of @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty compared to  @xcite is the @xmath0 resolvent bound in this gap . </S>",
    "<S> the short proof presented here is also more direct than those in  @xcite because it relies on regular semiclassical analysis rather than exotic symbol calculus , at a cost of not recovering the extensions ( a ) , ( b ) discussed above .    </S>",
    "<S> we next show ( theorem  [ t : gap2 ] ) the existence of deeper resonance free strips , under the additional assumptions of _ </S>",
