    "understanding the static and dynamic properties of ring polymer melts is one of the remaining challenges in polymer science . unlike linear polymers , the topological constraints for ring or cyclic polymers are permanent and this affects both their static and dynamic properties . for linear polymers",
    "the topological constraints imposed by the non - crossability of the chains ( entanglements ) force each chain to diffuse along its own coarse - grained backbone , the so - called primitive path , and this is well described by the reptation model of de gennes and edwards",

    ". for both linear and branched polymer melts , it is the free chain ends that make the known relaxation mechanisms possible .",
    "however , in the case of rings there are no free ends .",
    "this raises a number of unanswered questions regarding the motion and stress relaxation of ring polymer melts .    in the companion",

    "we pointed out that this system presents a formidable challenge to the current polymer theories .",
    "it is of considerable current experimental interest@xcite , and it is believed to have a significant projection on the problem of chromatin structure and dynamics in chromosomes .",
    "we refer the reader to the detailed discussion of these issues in the introduction section of our paper@xcite ; the large bibliography of relevant references is also in that paper .",
    "the difficulty of the melt of rings problem is such that even the equilibrium structure of nonconcatenated rings is highly non - trivial .",
    "we have computed a large number of equilibrium characteristics of this system in the previous paper@xcite .    in the present paper , the second in a series of two , we investigate the dynamic properties of ring polymer melts using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation . to our knowledge",

    "provides a basis to compare rather different simulational as well as experimental studies .",
    "the linear chain melts were simulated using the same model as the rings with chain lengths varying from 100 to 800 monomers per chain .",
    "such highly entangled melts have very long relaxation times and a highly parallelized simulation code had to be used .",
    "for the longest rings as many as 2048 ibm blue gene / p cores were used for a single simulation .",
    "all details about the model and the setup of the systems can be found in the preceding paper , where the very same simulations have been analyzed in order to understand the static properties of nonconcatenated ring polymers .",
    "all properties reported here are exclusively taken from the fully equilibrated part of the data . the simulation model is briefly presented in the next section .",
    "this is followed by a section on the dynamics as well as a primitive path analysis @xcite of the ring systems .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the results is given in section [ discuss ] with the key findings of the work and future challenges presented in the conclusions section .",
    "based on the kremer - grest ( kg ) model @xcite , all beads interact via a shifted lennard - jones potential ( wca or weeks - chandler - anderson potential ) with a cutoff of @xmath12 .",
    "nearest neighbor beads along the chain in addition interact via the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential , and chain stiffness is introduced by an angular potential.@xcite the model parameters are the same for all ring and linear polymer simulations reported in this work .",
    "the natural time scale of the wca potential is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass of a monomer . for the simulations we use @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this model has been frequently used for simulation studies of polymer melts and solutions , so that one can refer to ample information throughout the discussion of the present , new results . also , the linear chain data presented in this work is all new .",

    "the linear systems were composed of @xmath17 chains of length @xmath18 , 250 chains of @xmath19 , and 400 chains of length @xmath20 and 800 .",
    "an important parameter for our discussion is the entanglement length for linear polymers in a melt . for the model employed here this parameter was determined@xcite to be    @xmath21    for more details of the model , the setup and the notation and software used see the preceding paper@xcite",
    "the dynamics of ring polymers pose special problems for a theoretical description . based on the non - trivial structural properties found in the preceding paper we have to anticipate dynamic properties not observed in other polymer systems .",
    "while for short rings one can expect that the rouse model might describe the dynamics and stress relaxation fairly well , this problem for longer rings is completely open . from the static properties one sees that for large @xmath2 the rings exhibit an @xmath2-independent intrachain density , @xmath22 , resulting in a scaling of the overall extension as a globule , while at the same time there is still significant interpenetration between rings . for",

    "thus since the expected behavior is quite unclear , we present here a rather comprehensive first analysis of single and collective ring polymer dynamic properties .",
    "the motion of the rings and linear systems is characterized by the various mean - square displacements ( msd ) , and for the rings these results do not provide a consistent picture in terms of the known theoretical models .",

    "though there are still many details to be understood in the context of the dynamics of linear polymers , the rouse and reptation theories give a very good semi - quantitative description .",
    "while for linear polymer melts the basic dynamic concepts are fairly clear , the situation for ring melts is strikingly different .",
    "[ g13_rings_linear]c shows @xmath23 for the rings .",
    "all five data sets follow the same curve during early times .",
    "then , independent of @xmath2 we observe a significant slowing down in the mean - square displacement from the initial @xmath36 scaling to a power law very close to the @xmath34 expected for perfect reptation of linear polymers .",
    "note however that the rings can not entangle in the classical sense and thus the rings are not expected to show reptation - like behavior .",

    "[ g13_rings_linear]d , @xmath30 is shown for the rings along with a reference line with a slope of 3/4 .",
    "this scaling behavior is seen to provide reasonable agreement with the center - of - mass motion of all five ring systems and for the @xmath20 system it holds for several decades .",
    "the @xmath60 power law reminds one of a correlation hole effect for rouse chains , rather than any reptation phenomenon .",
    "the crossover towards free diffusion is in good agreement to what is observed from @xmath23 .",
    "however , the crossover to the free diffusion time scaling of @xmath61 occurs at values significantly larger than the chain extensions ( cf .",

    "this is in contrast to the linear systems which show a @xmath61 scaling after moving even somewhat less than their own size . for the longest rings the fully diffusive regime",
    "is not reached within the time frame of the simulation . for @xmath0",
    "eventually we observe an even smaller effective power law , deviating from the @xmath60 towards a minimal power around @xmath62 . the mean - square displacement data for the rings and linear systems is available in the supplementary material .",
    "another striking observation from fig .",
    "[ g13_rings_linear]d is that @xmath63 for short times does not become independent of @xmath2 .",
    "it displays a small but still clearly visible ring length dependence , indicating a delayed onset of the constraints imposed by surrounding rings with increasing ring size .",
    "such phenomena have not been observed in a polymeric system so far and suggests long - range ring - ring correlations , even though the chains can not be entangled in the classical sense .",
    "the slight increase of @xmath63 for short times and increasing @xmath2 is indicative of the fact that crumpled globules , which is the presumed state of nonconcatenated rings in the melt , are characterized by a rather deep correlation hole is independent of @xmath2 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus the observed behavior indicates that the initial free diffusion extends to slightly larger distances for the longer rings , reminiscent of typical cage effects in liquids . ] .    to gain additional insight into these correlations we examined the dynamics of the exchange of neighbors",

    "any given time each chain has a specific set of neighbors with the average number of chains in the set being @xmath69 , which is 11.6 for @xmath18 and 16.7 for @xmath0 .",
    "we computed the number of remaining ( unexchanged ) neighbors after the reference ring moved its own root - mean - square gyration radius .",
    "this number was found to increase with increasing chain length from @xmath70 for @xmath18 to @xmath71 for @xmath0 .",
    "we also computed how far the reference chain moved before all neighbors but one were exchanged .",
    "the calculation was performed using a large number of time origins and the root - mean - square displacement was found to increase with increasing chain length from about @xmath72 for @xmath18 to significantly more than 3@xmath73 for @xmath42 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these displacements are roughly the same as those required for the systems to reach the fully diffusive regime .     versus chain length for the rings and linear melts .",
    "the line through the ring data was fit to the values for the @xmath20 and 800 systems while for the linear data all points were used .",
    "the arrow beneath the point for the largest ring system indicates that its value is expected to decrease somewhat until the system reaches the fully diffusive regime .",

    "even though the ring polymers display a remarkable and so far unseen slowing down compared to a rouse - like motion , they diffuse significantly faster than their linear counterparts .",

    "the crossing of @xmath24 and @xmath26 is hardly reached .",

    "thus the overall diffusion decouples from the local internal rearrangement , as implied by the decay of @xmath93 .",

    "let us assume @xmath140 for the `` chain diffusion '' at intermediate times and @xmath141 for one monomer diffusion .",
    "we might write for a time dependent `` diffusion constant '' @xmath142 . assuming that @xmath143 , namely proportional to the number of beads carried along at a distance @xmath144 within an object of fractal dimension @xmath145 , we arrive at the relation @xmath146 requires @xmath147 for @xmath148 . ] .",
    "this relation appears to be consistent with our simulation data . indeed ,",
    "careful inspection of the data for @xmath23 indicates that the smallest slope is close to @xmath149 , systematically decaying with increasing chain length to slightly larger than @xmath150 .",
    "the smallest slope in @xmath26 for @xmath0 is close to @xmath151 , which is in good agreement with the above relation between @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "also the amplitude of @xmath26 , where the crossover towards free diffusion occurs needs some more attention .",
    "for instance , as shown in fig .",
    "[ g13_rings_linear ] , for the @xmath20 ring case the transition to @xmath154 at long times occurs at roughly @xmath155 where @xmath156 or @xmath157 . for the linear case at the transition one finds @xmath156 or @xmath158 . for the ring systems with @xmath20 and 800 ( and extrapolated for @xmath0 ) one then finds @xmath80 .",
    "all previous simulation papers have reported a weaker dependence with the strongest by hur et al.@xcite being @xmath159 .",
    "this is most probably due to the use of effectively shorter chains in the previous studies .",
    "another surprising result regarding the diffusion of the rings is that the stress relaxation follows an approximate @xmath160 scaling law , in fair agreement with the @xmath161 prediction of kapnistos et al.@xcite in fact , the @xmath42 ring system shows this behavior for at least four decades in time . while it is tempting to appeal to the rouse model since it predicts @xmath162 , this certainly can not apply .",
    "this fast decay , compared to what we observe from the mean - square displacements of the beads , is in accord with the observation that @xmath163 decays with a relaxation time @xmath164 .",
    "that means stress can relax by internal reorganization without the need to diffuse a significant distance away from its original neighbor chains or to fully relax the overall shape of the chain .",
    "this however is only possible because the rings eventually are compact objects . as a consequence , the characteristic stress relaxation time @xmath165 implies that the very small viscosity @xmath120 and the diffusion time , @xmath128 , @xmath166 , are not directly related to each other .",
    "this line of arguments does not take into account the existence of , as we called them , quasi - entanglements , which relax only very slowly and might give rise to a plateau - like regime in the stress relaxation function . for a possible plateau ,",
    "however , we expect a very small value of the order @xmath167 , simply because the number of neighbors that a given ring can entangle with becomes independent of @xmath2 and settles at a value below 20 , a typical number for a liquid .",
    "thus , if existing , such a plateau will be very difficult to observe and beyond the accuracy of our data .",
    "an attempt to describe the amoeba - like motion of the individual ring among other nonconcatenated rings was presented in a recent article by milner and newhall @xcite .",
    "these authors argue that since the ring in the lattice of obstacles passes each lattice gate twice in the opposite directions and , therefore , represents a kind of tree , then each bond separates the whole system in two halves , with the sizes @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "the smaller of the two numbers milner and newhall call `` centrality '' and provide convincing simulation data to the effect that effective motion along the `` reaction coordinate '' of centrality is sub - diffusive with @xmath170 .",
    "clearly , the diffusion of centrality in this picture is also closely related to the stress relaxation , which means that this picture is ideologically very close to that proposed by kapnistos et al @xcite .",
    "given the identical values of the exponents in the diffusion of centrality case and in our @xmath26 behavior for intermediate times and ring sizes , it is tempting to bridge the two statements .",
    "however , our conformations somehow suggest a rather extended regime of beads to qualify for the centrality argument , making the precise meaning of this concept somewhat unclear here .",
    "future work will be required to understand whether they are really related or there is just a coincidence of numerical values for the two exponents .",
    "the structural and dynamic properties of ring polymer melts have been investigated by molecular dynamics simulation using a semiflexible bead - spring model in this and the previous paper . for the longest chain lengths ,",
    "the radius of gyration was found to approach a scaling regime of @xmath171 in agreement with previous simulation results and theoretical studies . while this suggests collapsed conformations ,",
    "the rings are , in fact , open or expanded and highly interpenetrated by their few @xmath172 neighbors .",
    "this is supported by a primitive path analysis which was also used to show that the estimated quasi - entanglement number of the rings is larger than that of the analogous linear chains .",
    "the rings being not as entangled as the linear chains and more compact in size may explain why they relax stress faster and have a viscosity which scales much more weakly than the @xmath5 dependence of linear chains . despite following different scaling laws with @xmath2 for the radius of gyration ,",
    "stress relaxation and viscosity , and undergoing different modes of motion while diffusing , for large @xmath2 the two architectures approximately obey the same @xmath173 power law .",
    "because of the compact nature of the ring conformations , resulting in a fairly deep correlation hole , obtaining diffusion constants from such simulations might be subject to rather strong finite size effects in the number of chains considered .",
    "such polymeric systems have some resemblance to a soft sphere liquid which is known to be subject to such effects .",
    "however , we are confident that our systems with @xmath174 ring polymers are sufficiently large and we emphasize that studies using significantly fewer chains should be avoided .    though we have presented a rather comprehensive analysis many questions remain open .",
    "conformational properties need further attention , especially for questions with respect to biological issues .",
    "this concerns , for example , contact maps and the life time of the clusters seen in such maps@xcite . also , the precise determination of @xmath108 and @xmath175 and the related scaling prediction @xmath176 need further attention .",
    "the decoupling of translational motion and stress relaxation for rings , the latter leading to the low viscosity , certainly is not fully understood and needs further investigation .",
    "the sub - diffusive regime in the msd of the rings up to displacements that are significantly larger than @xmath126 poses special challenges for a proper theoretical description . to better compare our findings to experiments , a systematic study of the influence of linear `` contaminants '' is needed since experiments never can exclude them completely .",
    "such a study is in preparation@xcite and will also include an extensive analysis of the dynamic scattering functions of both the rings and the linear polymers .",
    "recent advances in synthesis , purification and characterization should allow a better comparison in the near future .",
    "while the main thrust of the two papers was on the properties of nonconcatenated ring polymer melts , for comparison we also have presented extensive simulations of highly entangled melts of linear polymers . while in general the reptation picture",
    "provides a good qualitative and semi - quantitative theoretical framework there are still open questions with respect to the slow crossover to the anticipated asymptotic regime or possible deviations thereof .",
