    "dilute gases of alkaline fermionic and bosonic atoms are superfluid at very low temperature : bose - einstein condensates have been obtained in the case of bosonic atoms @xcite , while condensation of molecules ( made out of two atoms ) has been observed in the case of fermionic atoms @xcite . for fermionic atoms in the weakly interacting regime ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fermi momentum and @xmath2 the s - wave scattering length ) bcs superfluidity is expected in the case of attractive interatomic interaction ( @xmath3 ) .    a striking experimental evidence for bcs superfluidity is still missing , even though various signals which would be coherent with a superfluid behavior have been observed in some experiments : the anisotropic expansion of the gas after releasing it from the trap @xcite , the measurement of the gap @xcite , the measurement of the frequencies and damping rates of the breathing modes @xcite .",
    "however , the gap has been actually measured only in the strongly interacting regime and no experimental values exist for the weakly interacting case .",
    "the anisotropic expansion on the one hand and the frequencies of the breathing modes on the other hand can be predicted within a hydrodynamic approach for a superfluid gas @xcite . in both cases",
    "the experimental observations agree very well with the hydrodynamic predictions , and this could actually be considered as an evidence for superfluidity . however , the predictions for a superfluid gas are the same as those for a normal gas in the presence of collisions .",
    "it is true that at the very low temperatures achieved in these experiments pauli principle is expected to inhibit collisions .",
    "however , the experimental measurements have been performed during the expansion of the gas after releasing it from the trap .",
    "in such a situation momentum space deformations are possible and collisions can survive even at very low temperatures .",
    "so far , it has not been possible to completely control this problem from an experimental point of view and , for this reason , no firm conclusions about superfluidity can actually be drawn .",
    "another limitation is related to the hydrodynamic approach : hydrodynamics can be safely applied only within the limits of validity of semiclassical approaches , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pairing gap and @xmath6 is the trapping frequency .",

    "we deal with the excitation spectra in the normal and superfluid phases of a dilute fermi gas and we analyze how these spectra are affected by superfluidity , both in hydrodynamic and microscopic descriptions . in order to study excitations similar to those observed experimentally ( the breathing modes ) we focused our attention on the monopole and quadrupole modes .",

    "the fully quantum mechanical calculation consists in solving the qrpa equations , which are the small - amplitude limit of the time - dependent bdg equations . at present",

    ", the `` realistic '' conditions can only be treated within semiclassical approaches .",
    "the simplest semiclassical approach is the hydrodynamic theory .",
    "this theory is valid in the superfluid phase at zero temperature , since the pairing correlations keep the fermi surface spherical during the collective motion of the system .",
    "however , hydrodynamics fails at non - zero temperature , unless the local equilibrium can be ensured by collisions .",

    "this divergence has the same origin as that of the pairing field .",

    "we therefore propose a simplified prescription : when calculating @xmath62 , we have to restrict the sum to states below the cutoff , @xmath69 . to compensate the resulting cutoff dependence , the interaction in the pairing channel must be replaced by the effective coupling constant given in eq .",

    "the system can not come to local equilibrium during the collective motion . in order to describe this effect",

    ", this function simply describes a fermi sphere : @xmath135 out of equilibrium , if the particles do not undergo enough collisions to restore the isotropic momentum distribution , the local fermi surface will assume a more complicated shape .",

    "we are mainly interested in the limits of validity of superfluid hydrodynamics , since this theory is widely used in order to analyze experimental results .",

    "the system was still very strongly interacting even on the bcs side of the crossover ( the strongest deviations happened when @xmath154 was of the order of @xmath155 ) , such that our weak - coupling theory ( valid for @xmath0 ) can not directly be compared to that experiment .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the limits of validity of hydrodynamics should be clarified .",
    "it is known that hydrodynamics works at zero temperature and if the level spacing @xmath101 is much smaller than the gap @xmath5 , but both conditions are generally not fulfilled in the experiments . since experiments can not be done at zero temperature , it is interesting to see what kind of temperature effects can arise below the critical temperature @xmath11 .",

    "the critical temperature @xmath11 being extremely low , it is clear that already at very low temperatures between @xmath196 and @xmath11 the properties of the collective modes must undergo dramatic changes .",
    "this is evident if the hydrodynamic frequency ( @xmath197 ) is different from that in the collisionless normal phase ( @xmath198 ) , like in the case of the quadrupole mode . in the case of the monopole mode",
    "we also find a strong temperature dependence , although its frequency at @xmath197 is the same as at @xmath198 . in the intermediate temperature range between @xmath196 and @xmath11 the collective modes exhibit strong landau damping .",
    "when the critical temperature is reached , the damping disappears and the collective modes can be very well described by the semiclassical vlasov equation within the generalized scaling approximation .",
    "it is interesting to compare these temperature effects with those found previously in the case of the twist mode @xcite , which is an excitation where the upper hemisphere rotates against the lower one . near @xmath11 ,",
    "the behavior is rather similar : at @xmath198 the twist mode is a collective mode which can be described by the generalized scaling approximation to the vlasov equation and whose frequency is slightly higher than the trap frequency .",
    "if the temperature is lowered , the twist mode becomes strongly damped , like the quadrupole and monopole modes .",
    "however , an important qualitative difference appears near zero temperature . since the velocity field of the twist mode",
    "can not be written as a gradient , the twist mode disappears completely at zero temperature , whereas the quadrupole and monopole modes have an irrotational velocity field and they reappear at zero temperature as hydrodynamic modes . in the case of the twist mode ,",
    "the disappearance of the @xmath199 weighted integrated strength could be well described within a rather simple two - fluid model @xcite .",
    "it remains to be studied if a generalization of the two - fluid model to the dynamical case can also explain the damping of the quadrupole and monopole modes and the two - peak structure in the quadrupole response function at temperatures between @xmath196 and @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to temperature effects , we studied how the properties of the quadrupole mode change at zero temperature when the condition for the validity of the hydrodynamic approach , @xmath200 , is no longer satisfied . for parameters leading to @xmath201",
    "the qrpa already shows considerable deviations from the hydrodynamic theory . in the case of the quadrupole mode , the frequency for these parameters",
    "is found to be lower by @xmath202 than the hydrodynamic prediction , and a certain fragmentation of the excitation spectrum ( i.e. , damping of the collective mode ) can be observed . if @xmath203 , the hydrodynamic mode has more or less disappeared . at the same time",
    ", a fragmented strength appears in the excitation spectrum near the frequency of the collective quadrupole mode in the normal collisionless phase .",
    "these results should be kept in mind when frequencies of collective modes measured in experiments with strongly deformed traps are compared with the hydrodynamic predictions .",
    "due to the strong deformation , the radial trap frequency @xmath204 is often much higher than the axial one , @xmath205 . even in the case of strong pairing",
    ", the gap might be of the order of , say , @xmath206 , and considerable deviations from hydrodynamics are possible .",
