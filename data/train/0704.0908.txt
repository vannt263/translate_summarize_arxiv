    "the detection of an extreme `` cold spot '' @xcite in the foreground - corrected wmap images was an exciting but unexpected finding . at 4@xmath2 resolution ,",
    "cruz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) determine an amplitude of -73  @xmath4k , which reduces to -20  @xmath4k at @xmath110@xmath2 scales @xcite .",
    "the non - gaussianity of this extreme region has been scrutinized , ( cayon , jun & treaster 2005 ; cruz et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007 ) concluding that it can not be explained by either foreground correction problems or the normal gaussian fluctuations of the cmb .",
    "thus , the cold spot seems to require a distinct origin  either primordial or local . across the whole sky ,",
    "local mass tracers such as the optical sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the radio nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are seen to correlate with the wmap images of the cmb @xcite , probably through the late integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite extended the study of radio source / cmb correlations by performing a steerable wavelet analysis of nvss source counts and wmap images .",
    "they isolated 18 regions that , as a group , contributed a significant fraction of the total nvss - isw signal .",
    "three of those 18 regions were additionally robust to the choice of wavelet form .",
    "the centroid of one of those three robust correlated regions , ( # 16 ) , is inside the 10@xmath2 cold spot derived from wmap data alone @xcite , although @xcite did not point out this association .",
    "the investigations reported here were conducted independently and originally without knowledge of the @xcite analysis . however , our work is _ a posteriori _ in nature , because we were specifically looking for the properties in the direction of the cold spot .",
    "these results thus support and quantify the nvss properties in the specific direction of the cold spot , but should be considered along with the @xcite analysis for the purposes of an unbiased proof of a wmap association .",
    "we examined both the _ number counts _ of nvss sources in the direction of the wmap cold spot and their _ smoothed brightness distribution_. the nvss 21  cm survey covers the sky above a declination of -40@xmath2 at a resolution of 45  .",
    "it has an rms noise of 0.45 mjy / beam and is accompanied by a catalog of sources stronger than 2.5 mjy / beam . because of the short interferometric observations that went into its construction , the survey is insensitive to diffuse sources greater than @xmath5 15 in extent .",
    "convolution of the nvss images to larger beam sizes , as done here , shows the integrated surface brightness of small extragalactic sources ; this is very different than what would be observed by a single dish of equivalent resolution . in the latter case ,",
    "the diffuse structure of the milky way galaxy dominates ( e.g , @xcite ) , although it is largely invisible to the interferometer .    to explore the extragalactic radio source population in the direction of the wmap cold spot , we first show in figure 1 the 50@xmath650@xmath2 region around the cold spot convolved to a resolution of 3.4@xmath2 . here",
    ", the region of the cold spot is seen to be the faintest region on the image ( minimum at l@xmath7,b@xmath7  =   207.8@xmath2 ,  -56.3@xmath2 ) . at minimum",
    ", its brightness is 14  mk below the mean , with an extent of @xmath55@xmath2 .",
    "the wmap cold spot thus picks out a special region in the nvss  at least within this 2500@xmath8 region .",
    "we examined the smoothed brightness distribution across the whole nvss survey using another averaging technique that reduces the confusion from the brightest sources . we first pre - convolved the images to 800  , which fills all the gaps between neighboring sources , and then calculated the _",
    "median _ brightness in sliding boxes 3.4@xmath2 on a side .",
    "the resulting image is shown in figure [ allsky ] which is in galactic coordinates centered at l@xmath7=180@xmath2 .",
    "the dark regions near the galactic plane are regions of the nvss survey that were perturbed by the presence of very strong sources .",
    "note that the galactic plane itself , which dominates single dish maps , is only detectable here between -20@xmath9 90@xmath2 , where there is a local increase in the number of small sources detectable by the interferometer .    to evaluate the nvss brightness properties of the cold spot , we compared it with the distribution of median brightnesses in two strips from this all sky map .",
    "the first strip was in the north , taking everything above a nominal galactic latitude of 30@xmath2 ( more precisely , we used the horizontal line in the aitoff projection tangent to the 30@xmath2 line at l@xmath7=180@xmath2 . )",
    "the second strip was in the south , taking everything below a nominal galactic latitude of -30@xmath2 , but only from 10@xmath10180@xmath2 , to avoid regions near the survey limit of @xmath11=-40@xmath2 .",
    "the minimum brightness in the cold spot region ( @xmath5  20  mk ) is equal to the lowest values seen in the 16,800 square degree area of the two strips , and is @xmath5  30% below the mean ( figure [ coldcum ] ) .    formally , the probability of finding this weakest nvss spot within the @xmath510@xmath2 ( diameter ) region of the wmap cold spot is 0.6% .",
    "this _ a posteriori _ analysis thus is in agreement with the statistical conclusions of @xcite that the nvss properties in this region are linked to those of wmap .",
    "we also note that the magnitude of the nvss dip is at the extreme , but not an outlier of the overall brightness distribution .",
    "we thus expect that less extreme nvss dips would also individually correlate with wmap cold regions , although it may be more difficult to separate those from the primordial fluctuations .",
    "the nvss brightness dip can be seen at a number of resolutions , and there is probably more than one scale size present . at resolutions of 1@xmath2 , 3.4@xmath2 , and 10@xmath2 , we find that the dip is @xmath5 60% , 30% and 10% of the respective mean brightness . at 10@xmath2 resolution ,",
    "the nvss deficit overlaps with another faint region about 10@xmath2 to the west , while the average dip in brightness then decreases from -14  mk ( at 3.4@xmath2 ) to -4  mk .",
    "the dip in nvss brightness in the wmap cold spot region is not due to some peculiarity of the nvss survey itself . in figure 4",
    ", we compare the 1@xmath2 convolved nvss image with the similar resolution , single dish 408 mhz image of @xcite .",
    "this 408 mhz all sky map is dominated in most places by galactic emission , and was usedby @xcite as a template for estimating the synchrotron contribution in cmb observations . on scales of 1@xmath2 , the _ fluctuations _ in brightness are a combination of galactic ( diffuse ) and extragalactic ( smeared small source ) contributions . in the region of the cold spot , we can see the extragalactic contribution at 408 mhz by comparison with the smoothed nvss 1.4 ghz image . note that although there is flux everywhere in the nvss image , this is the `` confusion '' from the smoothed contribution of multiple small extragalactic sources in each beam , whereas the 408 mhz map has strong diffuse galactic emission as well .",
    "strong brightness dips are seen in both images in the region of the wmap cold spot - with the brightness dropping by as much as 62% in the smoothed nvss ; in the 408 mhz map , this is diluted by galactic emission .    to look more quantitatively at the source density in the cold spot region",
    ", we measured the density of nvss sources ( independent of their fluxes ) as a function of distance from the cold spot . figure 5 shows the counts in equal area annuli around the wmap cold spot down to two different flux limits . with a limit of 5 mjy , there is a 45@xmath128% decrease in counts in the 1@xmath2 radius circle around the wmap cold spot centroid . at the survey flux limit of 2.5 mjy ,",
    "the decrease is 23@xmath123% .",
    "this reduction in number counts is what is measured by @xcite in their statistical all - sky analysis .",
    "several studies have claimed that the properties of the cold spot are most likely an effect of incorrect foreground subtraction @xcite . this possibility has been investigated in detail for both the first year @xcite and third @xcite year wmap data .",
    "the arguments _ against _ foreground subtraction errors can be summarized in three main points ",
    "1 ) the region of the spot shows no spectral dependence in the wmap data .",
    "this is consistent with the cmb and inconsistent with the known spectral behavior of galactic emission ( as well as the sz effect ) .",
    "the flat ( cmb - like ) spectrum is found both in temperature and kurtosis , as well as in real and wavelet space .",
    "2 ) foreground emission is found to be low in the region of the spot , making it unlikely that an over - subtraction could produce an apparent non - gaussianity .",
    "3 ) similar results are found when using totally independent methods to model and subtract out the foreground emission @xcite , namely the combined and foreground cleaned q - v - w map @xcite and the weighted internal linear combination analysis @xcite .",
    "now that we know that there is a reduction in the extragalactic radio source contribution in the direction of the cold spot , we can re - examine this issue .",
    "we ask whether a 20 - 30% decrement in the local brightness of the extragalactic synchrotron emission could translate into a foreground subtraction problem that could generate the wmap cold spot .",
    "we are not re - examining the foreground question _ ab initio _ , simply examining the plausibility that the deficit of nvss sources could complicate the foreground calculations in this location . the characteristic brightness in the 3.4@xmath2",
    "convolved nvss image around the cold spot is @xmath1 51 mk at 1.4 ghz ; the brightness of the cold spot is @xmath1 37 mk .",
    "this difference of 14 mk in brightness ( 4  mk at 10@xmath2 resolution ) represents the extragalactic population contribution only , as the nvss is not sensitive to the large scale galactic synchrotron emission .",
    "by contrast , the single dish 1.4 ghz brightness within a few degrees of the cold spot is @xmath1 3.4  k , as measured using the bonn stockert 25  m telescope @xcite .",
    "therefore the total synchrotron contribution at 1.4 ghz is @xmath1  0.7  k above the cmb , 50 times larger than the localized extragalactic deficit .",
    "one way to create the cold spot would be if the universal spectral index used for the normal galactic ( plus small extragalactic ) subtraction was incorrect for the _ extra _ brightness temperature contribution of the nvss dip ,   @xmath11 t ( -14  mk at l band , 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "we make an order of magnitude estimate of this potential error .",
    "following the first year data analysis @xcite , and the similar exercise performed by @xcite , we consider fitting a synchrotron template map at some reference frequency @xmath13 , and extrapolating the model , ( f(@xmath14)@xmath15 ) , with a spectral index of @xmath16 to the q , v , and w bands .",
    "this spectral index is consistent with those of @xcite and the average spectral index observed in the wmap images @xcite . under the null hypothesis",
    "that the spectral index of @xmath11 t is the same as that of the mean brightness t@xmath17 , we then calculate in the region of the deficit ,    @xmath18\\left(\\nu/\\nu_{ref}\\right)^{-3}.\\ ] ]    however , if the actual spectrum of @xmath11 t is   -@xmath19 ( from l band through w band ) instead of -3 , then the true foreground subtraction , f@xmath20 , should have been    @xmath21    the foreground subtraction would then be in error as a function of frequency as follows , expressed in terms of the l band temperatures :    @xmath22.\\ ] ]    three different reference frequencies have been used for synchrotron extrapolation ",
    "the @xcite 408 mhz map @xcite , the @xcite 2326 mhz rhodes / hartrao survey @xcite , and the internal k and ka band wmap images @xcite .",
    "since the foreground subtraction errors would be worst extrapolating from the lowest frequency template , we start at 408  mhz and look at the problems caused by a spectral index for @xmath11 t that is different than the assumed -3 .",
    "we obtain a rough measure of the spectral index of the dip by comparing the 1@xmath2 resolution maps ( figure 4 ) at 408  mhz and 1400  mhz . at l@xmath7,b@xmath7",
    "=  207@xmath2,-55@xmath2 , we find @xmath11 t  =  2.6@xmath120.75  k ( 30@xmath1212  mk ) at 408 ( 1400 ) mhz , yielding a spectral index of -3.6@xmath120.5 . using equation ( 3 ) , this would actually lead to a wmap `` hot spot '' if a spectral index of -3.0 had been assumed for the extrapolation .",
    "within the errors , the worst foreground extrapolation mistakes would then be hot spots that range from + 0.5 to + 4.6  @xmath4k at q band , 1@xmath2 resolution , ( @xmath5 + 0.25 to + 2.3  @xmath4k at 4@xmath2 resolution ) .",
    "our derived spectral index for the dip is steeper than expected for extragalactic sources , so we also do the calculation assuming the flattest reasonable extragalactic spectrum of -2.5 .",
    "this would lead to a spurious cold spot of -2.9  @xmath4k at 4@xmath2 resolution . in either case , this is far below the -73  @xmath4k observed at this resolution in wmap , and we thus conclude that the deficit of nvss sources does not lead to a significant foreground subtraction error of either sign .",
    "the wmap cold spot could have three origins : a ) at the last scattering surface ( @xmath23 ) , b ) cosmologically local ( @xmath24 ) , or c ) galactic . because the spot corresponds to a significant deficit of flux ( and source number counts ) in the nvss ,",
    "we have argued here that the spot is cosmologically local and hence , a localized manifestation of the late isw effect .",
    "@xcite derived a temperature deviation for the cold spot of @xmath25k and a diameter of @xmath26 using the wmap 3 year data ; on scales of @xmath27 the average temperature is lower , @xmath28k . using these two data points we derive an approximate relation between the temperature deviation and the corresponding size of the cold spot : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the radius of the cold spot in degrees .",
    "we now perform an order of magnitude calculation to see if the late isw can produce such a spot , assuming that the entire effect comes from the isw .",
    "the contribution of the late isw along a given line of sight is given by @xmath31 , where the dot represents differentiation with respect to the conformal time @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the scale factor .",
    "the integrand will be non - zero only at late times ( z@xmath351 ) when the cosmological constant becomes dynamically dominant .",
    "we start with the newtonian potential given by @xmath36 the proper size @xmath37 and the background density @xmath38 scale as @xmath34 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the growth of the fractional density excess , @xmath40 in the linear regime is given by @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the linear growth factor . for redshifts below @xmath43 in @xmath44cdm ,",
    "this factor can be approximated as @xmath45 .",
    "assuming that the region is spherical , its comoving radius is @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the line of sight diameter of the region .",
    "the change in the potential over @xmath48 can be approximated by @xmath49 where subscript @xmath50 refers to the average comoving size of the void and the comoving background density . in @xmath44cdm",
    "the hubble parameter is roughly given by @xmath51 , for redshifts below @xmath43 .",
    "incorporating these approximations we get the following relation between the size of the region , its redshift and the temperature deviation from the late isw : @xmath52 we now ask under what conditions this expression is consistent with the observed relation between the size and temperature of the cold spot derived earlier , @xmath29 . for @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( i.e. a completely empty region )",
    "this leads to the simplified relation , @xmath55 , where @xmath30 is in degrees , as before .",
    "since the spot s association with the nvss places it at @xmath56 , this leads to a self - consistent value of the radius of @xmath57 for the observed spot . for @xmath58  mpc ,",
    "the comoving radius of the void region is 120 - 160  mpc .",
    "how likely is such a large underdense region in a concordance cosmology ?",
    "suppose there is only one such large underdense region in the whole volume up to z=1 .",
    "the corresponding void frequency is then the ratio of the comoving volume of the void to the comoving volume of the universe to z=1 , which is roughly @xmath59 .",
    "is this consistent with @xmath44cdm ?",
    "void statistics have been done for a number of optical galaxy surveys , as well as numerical structure formation simulations .",
    "taking the most optimistic void statistics ( filled dots in fig .",
    "9 of hoyle & vogeley , 2004 ) which can be approximated by @xmath60 , a 140  mpc void would occur with a probability of @xmath61 , considerably more rare than our estimate for our universe ( @xmath59 ) based on the existence of the cold spot .",
    "one must keep in mind , however , that observational and numerical void probability studies are limited to @xmath62  mpc ; it is not yet clear how these should be extrapolated to @xmath63  mpc .",
    "we note that @xcite had already suggested that anomalous temperature anisotropies in the cmb , such as the cold spot , may be explained by the isw effect .",
    "in contrast to our calculation described above , their analysis considers the linear isw plus the second order effects due to an expanding compensated void , partially filled with pressureless dust , embedded in a standard cdm ( inoue and silk 2006a ) or @xmath44cdm ( inoue and silk 2006b ) background .",
    "it is reassuring that the size of the void indicated by their analysis  about 200 mpc if located at @xmath64is roughly the same as what we get here using linear isw .    the need for an extraordinarily large void to explain the cold spot would add to the list of anomalies associated with the cmb .",
    "( see @xcite for a theory that predicts such large voids based on a particular landscape model . )",
    "these include the systematically higher strength of the late isw correlation measured for a variety of mass tracers , compared to the wmap predictions ( see fig .",
    "11 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the alignment and planarity of the quadrupole and the octopole @xcite .",
    "we can , however , conclude that models linking the cold spot with the larger scale anomalies , such as the anisotropic bianchi type vii@xmath65 model of jaffe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , are no longer necessary . while we suggest that the cold spot is a local effect , low order global anisotropic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may still be needed for the low@xmath66 anomalies .",
    "we have detected a significant dip in the average surface brightness and number counts of radio sources from the nvss survey at 1.4 ghz in the direction of the wmap cold spot .",
    "the deficit of extragalactic sources is also seen in a single dish image at 408 mhz .",
    "together with previous work , we rule out instrumental artifacts in wmap due to foreground subtraction . a fuller examination of the statistical uncertainties associated with our combination of the @xcite wavelet results and our own _ a posteriori _",
    "analysis should be performed . with this caveat ,",
    "we conclude that the cold spot arises from effects along the line of sight , and not at the last scattering surface itself .",
    "any non - gaussianity of the wmap cold spot therefore would then have a local origin .",
    "a 140  mpc radius , completely empty void at z@xmath671 is sufficient to create the magnitude and angular size of the cold spot through the late integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "voids this large currently seem improbable in the concordance cosmology , adding to the anomalies associated with the cmb .",
    "we suggest that a closer investigation of all mass tracers would be useful to search for significant contributions from isolated regions . also , if our interpretation of the cold spot is correct , it might be possible to detect it indirectly using planck , through the lack of lensing - induced polarization @xmath68 modes @xcite .",
