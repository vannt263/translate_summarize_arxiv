    "let @xmath0 be a real polynomial on @xmath1 . a basic question one can ask is whether @xmath9 . one way to show that a polynomial is nonnegative is to write it as a sum of hermitian squares @xmath10 for holomorphic polynomials @xmath11 , i.e. , as the squared norm @xmath12 of a holomorphic mapping @xmath13 .",
    "there exist , however , nonnegative polynomials that can not be written as a squared norm ; to construct an easy example , take @xmath4 nonnegative but with zero set a real hypersurface . for a much more subtle example ,",
    "consider example vi.3.6 in @xcite : @xmath14 this polynomial is non - negative , its zero set is a complex line , and yet it can not even be written as a quotient of squared norms .",
    "thus the condition that a real polynomial is a squared norm is too restrictive , and one is motivated to formulate other less restrictive positivity conditions .",
    "see @xcite and the references within .",
    "a theorem of quillen @xcite , proved independently by catlin and dangelo @xcite , states that if a bihomogeneous polynomial @xmath15 is positive on the unit sphere , then there exists an integer @xmath2 such that @xmath16 is a squared norm , and hence @xmath4 is a quotient of squared norms .",
    "thus one obtains a hermitian analogue of hilbert s 17th problem .    with this motivation",
    ", we define a set of positivity classes @xmath8 of bihomogeneous polynomials by @xmath17 @xmath18 consists of the squared norms themselves , and , by the theorem mentioned above , @xmath19 contains the polynomials positive on the sphere .",
    "it is not difficult ( proposition  [ prop : qsdistinct ] ) to construct polynomials that show @xmath20    every real polynomial @xmath4 has a holomorphic decomposition @xmath21 for holomorphic polynomials @xmath11 , @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath23 and @xmath24 are minimal ( which occurs when @xmath25 are linearly independent ) , we say that @xmath4 has signature pair @xmath26 and rank @xmath27 . while @xmath13 and @xmath28 are not unique , the signature pair @xmath26 is .    we will be particularly concerned with @xmath29 .",
    "this class is connected to the study of proper holomorphic mappings between balls in complex euclidean spaces of different dimensions .",
    "for example , if @xmath30 is a polynomial that takes the unit ball to the unit ball properly , then @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath13 is of degree @xmath2 and @xmath32 is the degree @xmath2 part of @xmath13 , then @xmath33 .",
    "polynomials in @xmath29 also arise when studying the second fundamental form of more general mappings between balls .",
    "see the recent work by ebenfelt  @xcite and the references within .",
    "for example , by proving that @xmath34 must be of rank at least @xmath7 , huang  @xcite proved that all proper mappings between balls that are sufficiently smooth on the boundary are equivalent to the linear embeddings if @xmath35 .",
    "our main result for the positivity class @xmath29 is the following .",
    "[ thm : thmd1 ] let @xmath0 be a real polynomial on @xmath1 , @xmath36 , and suppose that @xmath37 is a squared norm .",
    "let @xmath26 be the signature pair of @xmath4",
    ". then    a.   @xmath38 b.   the above inequality is sharp , i.e. , for every @xmath39 there exists @xmath4 with @xmath40 .",
    "the case for @xmath41 is trivial ; @xmath42 and so @xmath43 has the same signature as @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath43 is a squared norm , then @xmath4 is a squared norm and @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath6 , the combinatorics becomes more involved .",
    "we obtain the following bound .",
    "[ thm : thmalld ] let @xmath0 be a real polynomial on @xmath1 , @xmath36 , @xmath45 , and suppose that @xmath46 is a squared norm .",
    "let @xmath26 be the signature pair of @xmath4 .",
    "then    a.   @xmath47 b.   for each fixed @xmath7 , there exists a positive constant @xmath48 such that for each @xmath2 there is a polynomial @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath51 is a polynomial in @xmath2 of degree @xmath52 , the second item says that the bound we obtain is of the correct order , although we do not believe it to be sharp for all @xmath7 ( it is sharp when @xmath53 ) .    for bihomogeneous polynomials",
    "we obtain bounds for the ratios of positive and negative eigenvalues for the classes @xmath8 .",
    "a very interesting problem is to find the smallest @xmath2 so that a positive polynomial is in @xmath8 ; see the work of to and yeung  @xcite .",
    "an upper bound must involve the magnitude of the coefficients . to see this , consider an example from @xcite : @xmath54 as @xmath55 , one requires larger and larger @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , our results give an effective lower bound on @xmath2 given the numbers @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "we also address the analogous question for real polynomials , i.e. , what can we say about a polynomial @xmath56 $ ] if it is known that @xmath57 has non - negative coefficients ?",
    "plya proved in  @xcite that for each @xmath58 positive on the positive quadrant , there exists a @xmath2 such that @xmath57 has only positive coefficients .",
    "recent work ( for example  @xcite ) focuses on finding an upper bound on @xmath2 given information about @xmath58 .",
    "our work can be thought of as finding lower bounds on @xmath2 given the signature of @xmath58 in a somewhat more general setting .",
    "when we complexify a real polynomial we obtain a hermitian symmetric polynomial , i.e. , one satisfying @xmath59 .",
    "hermitian symmetric polynomials arise naturally in complex geometry , in particular , degree @xmath2 hermitian symmetric polynomials arise as globalizable metrics on the @xmath2th power of the universal bundle over the complex projective space ; see  @xcite .",
    "questions about multiples of @xmath60 also arise in several contexts .",
    "as mentioned above , huang  @xcite proved that @xmath34 must have rank at least @xmath7 .",
    "generalizing this result , in @xcite it was shown that the rank of @xmath61 is bigger than or equal to the rank of @xmath60 .",
    "a theorem of pfister says the if @xmath62 for a polynomial @xmath58 of @xmath7 real variables , there exists a polynomial @xmath63 such that @xmath64 is a sum of at most @xmath65 squared polynomials .",
    "thus @xcite shows that pfister s theorem fails in the hermitian context .",
    "finally , ratios of the sort considered have been studied recently by grundmeier  @xcite in the context of group invariant hyperquadric cr mappings . in particular , grundmeier studied the canonically defined group - invariant mappings from the ball to the hyperquadric .",
    "this problem can be seen as studying the proportions of positive and negative eigenvalues of group - invariant polynomials of the form @xmath66 .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge peter ebenfelt , whose question led to this research .",
    "we would also like to express our gratitude to john p. dangelo for many fruitful conversations .",
    "finally , we thank iris lee for her sense of humor .",
    "let @xmath0 be a real - valued polynomial on @xmath1 .",
    "we use a linear algebra setting .",
    "suppose @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the vector of all monomials up to degree @xmath69 , with @xmath70 its conjugate transpose .",
    "then @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant hermitian matrix .",
    "the rank of @xmath4 is the rank of @xmath72 , and the signature of @xmath4 is @xmath26 if and only if @xmath72 has @xmath23 positive and @xmath24 negative eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , when we apply linear algebra terminology to @xmath4 we are referring to properties of the matrix @xmath72 .    when @xmath4 is diagonal , the @xmath11 and @xmath22 appearing in the holomorphic decomposition are monomials . in this case",
    ", questions about @xmath0 and @xmath46 for @xmath73 can be reformulated as questions about polynomials on @xmath74 . indeed , if in , each @xmath11",
    ", @xmath22 is a monomial @xmath75 for some multi - index @xmath76 , then @xmath77 if @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 , then @xmath80 .",
    "thus we can study @xmath4 by studying an associated real polynomial @xmath58 on @xmath81 with @xmath23 positive and @xmath24 negative coefficients .",
    "observe that @xmath82 is itself a diagonal polynomial and is associated with @xmath83 .",
    "one can therefore formulate the associated problem for real polynomials .",
    "we consider real polynomials @xmath84 for which @xmath85 has only nonnegative coefficients .",
    "such polynomials are nonnegative on @xmath81 .",
    "since it is not hard to see how to go from a real polynomial @xmath84 on @xmath86 to its hermitian analogue @xmath0 on @xmath1 , if we construct a @xmath84 with signature @xmath26 , we automatically also construct an @xmath0 with the same signature @xmath26 .",
    "in this section we focus on the diagonal case . the combinatorics in this special case",
    "gives insight into the general case , and furthermore , we obtain somewhat stronger results .",
    "the polynomials we construct to establish the sense in which our bounds are sharp are all diagonal .",
    "thus the second part of theorem  [ thm : thmd1 ] follows immediately from the last part of the next theorem .",
    "[ thm : monthm1 ] suppose @xmath58 is a polynomial on @xmath86 , @xmath36 , and set @xmath87 .",
    "suppose @xmath88 has only nonnegative coefficients .",

    "a.   if @xmath89 , then @xmath90 . b.   @xmath91 .",
    "c.   for every @xmath39 , there exists @xmath58 with @xmath92 .    before proving the theorem , we describe a useful visualization for our constructions .",
    "consider homogeneous polynomials in @xmath93 variables . to avoid subscripts @xmath94 .",
    "thus we consider polynomials @xmath95 such that @xmath96 has only nonnegative coefficients . in figure",
    "[ fig : newton1neg ] , we show a diagram for the polynomial @xmath97 .",
    "we arrange the monomials in a lattice and mark positive coefficients by a @xmath98 in a thick circle and negative coefficients by an @xmath99 in a thin circle . in this first diagram , we indicate which monomial each circle represents , though we refrain from doing so for larger diagrams .",
    "zero coefficients are marked with dotted circle and do not really come into play .",
    "we also mark by gray triangles the monomials appearing in the product @xmath100 .",
    "the vertices of each triangle point to monomials of @xmath58 that contribute to that term of @xmath101 .",
    "we ignore the magnitude of the coefficients ; we are only interested in their signs .",
    "if a term in the product @xmath101 receives contributions from both positive and negative terms in @xmath58 , we can increase the positive coefficients so that the sum of the positive contributions is bigger than the sum of the negative contributions , thus ensuring that @xmath101 has only positive coefficients . for @xmath101 to have",
    "only positive coefficients , each nonzero term in @xmath101 must get at least one positive contribution , and hence each triangle must have one vertex pointing to a @xmath98 in the diagram of @xmath58 .",
    "we do not show triangles that receive no contribution from a term in @xmath58 .     with one negative term .",
    "]    figure  [ fig : newton6neg ] shows the diagram for a polynomial @xmath58 with 6 negative coefficients .",
    "the key point is that each gray triangle has at least one vertex pointing to a @xmath98 in the diagram .",
    "it is not hard to argue that , if we have 6 negative terms , we must have at least 7 positive terms .",
    "thus this figure is in some sense optimal .",
    "an explicit polynomial having the diagram of figure  [ fig : newton6neg ] is @xmath102 with 7 positive and only 6 negative coefficients , @xmath103 is far from the predicted bound of 2 .",
    "furthermore , this polynomial is already of degree 6 . to obtain polynomials with ratio close to the bound",
    ", we must take the degree to be very large , and it is impractical to give diagrams for specific examples .",
    "however , the pattern in figure  [ fig : newton6neg ] can be extended to obtain our  sharp \" examples ; the idea is to make the interior of the diagram as in figure  [ fig : newtontile ] .",
    "( we omit the triangles . )    . ]    in order to make the diagram correspond to a polynomial , we must make this pattern part of a finite diagram .",
    "we will show that if we take all terms on the boundary to be positive , no negative terms will appear in @xmath101 .",
    "because of these boundary terms , we will have slightly more than one positive term for every two negative terms .    for any polynomial @xmath58 in @xmath7 variables , write @xmath104 where each @xmath105 is homogeneous of degree @xmath106 . since we obtain @xmath101 by multiplying @xmath58 by a homogeneous polynomial of degree one ,",

    "it is , however , in a special form that we can exploit .",
    "although several rows may have their leading term in the same column , since each @xmath273 is in partial row - echelon form , each column can contain the leading terms for at most @xmath7 rows .    at this point ,",
    "the precise ordering of the rows of @xmath264 is not important ; we are only interested in the numbers of rows associated with positive ( resp",

    "the second type of row of @xmath277 is one with leading term in one of the @xmath283 columns corresponding to a column of @xmath98 containing a leading term .",
    "since one of the at most @xmath7 rows with a leading term in this column must be in @xmath98 , @xmath277 has at most @xmath294 rows of the second type .",
    "this number @xmath294 is still an overestimate for two reasons .",
    "first , of the @xmath283 columns , the left - most has only a single entry , and it appears in @xmath98 . to see this , consider the initial monomials of the @xmath11 and @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath295 be the one that comes first in the monomial order .",
    "if it were the initial monomial of , say , @xmath296 , then @xmath297 would have an initial monomial @xmath298 coming before the initial monomial of any of the @xmath299 , contradicting the fact that @xmath297 is in the span of the @xmath299 .",
    "thus @xmath295 is the initial monomial of one of the @xmath11 .",
    "since all the @xmath11 have distinct initial monomials and because our monomial order is multiplicative , the left - most column of @xmath300 $ ] containing a non - zero entry is that corresponding to @xmath301 , and it contains precisely one non - zero entry .",
    "second , we must account for the additional @xmath285 rows in @xmath98 that also have leading term in one of the @xmath302 columns .",
    "thus @xmath303 is still an upper bound for the number of rows in @xmath277 of this second type .",
    "we find : @xmath304",
    "[ lemma : n-/n+ for d>1 ] let @xmath0 be a real polynomial on @xmath1 , @xmath36 , and suppose that @xmath46 is a squared norm . let @xmath26 be the signature pair of @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath305    we follow the proof of lemma  [ lemma : thmd1part1 ] .",
    "when we multiply @xmath306 by @xmath307 instead of @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath51 matrices @xmath273 rather than @xmath7 . more explicitly , order the degree @xmath2 multi - indices and let @xmath76 be the @xmath106th multi - index .",
    "let @xmath273 be the matrix defined by @xmath308 as above , since @xmath72 is in partial row - echelon form and the monomial order is multiplicative , @xmath273 is in partial row - echelon form as well .",
    "then @xmath309 in the matrix @xmath264 , each column contains the leading term of at most @xmath51 rows , though , as above , the left - most non - zero column contains only a single non - zero entry since it comes about by multiplying the least monomial @xmath295 in all the @xmath11 by @xmath310 .",
    "thus in a manner identical to the above we obtain : @xmath311    the proof does not use anything about @xmath307 except that it is a squared norm , its matrix of coefficients is diagonal , and it has rank @xmath51 .",
    "therefore we also obtain the following statement .",
    "let @xmath0 be a real polynomial on @xmath1 , and consider @xmath312 , where @xmath313 are distinct multi - indices .",

    "lemma [ lemma : n-/n+ for d>1 ] merely gives an upper bound for @xmath103 for @xmath316 ; it remains to determine whether the result is sharp .",
    "we first discuss the case @xmath53 .",
    "lemma [ lemma : n-/n+ for d>1 ] gives @xmath317 , which we claim is sharp for all @xmath2 . to prove this",
    ", we construct a family @xmath318 of polynomials in two real variables such that @xmath319 has all non - negative coefficients and the ratio @xmath190 of negative to positive coefficients tends to @xmath2 as @xmath162 .",
    "the idea of the construction is quite simple ; define @xmath320 where the first and last coefficients are positive and the interior coefficients repeat a pattern of @xmath2 negatives followed by a positive .    more explicitly , suppose @xmath321 for @xmath322 and define @xmath323 , where @xmath324 for this family , @xmath325 , which tends to @xmath2 as @xmath162 .",
    "it only remains to verify as we did in the proof of part ( iii ) of theorem [ thm : monthm1 ] that the coefficients of @xmath160 have been chosen so that @xmath166 has all nonnegative coefficients .",
    "we omit the details .      for @xmath93",
    ", we were able to construct polynomials @xmath58 for which @xmath328 has all non - negative coefficients and with @xmath329 we omit the details ; we simply mention that the construction can be done by considering the diagram to be an infinite plane and by using a pattern of @xmath98s generated by two generalized knight moves .",
    "computer experimentation suggests this bound may , in fact , be optimal .",
    "therefore , we suspect is not sharp .",
    "the proof is by induction on the number of variables @xmath7 . when @xmath53 , we proved above that we can find polynomials for which @xmath339 has non - negative coefficients with the ratio @xmath103 arbitrarily close to @xmath2 .",
    "thus there exists a polynomial for which the ratio exceeds @xmath340 .",
    "thus the result holds for @xmath53 .",
    "we proceed to the inductive step . to simplify notation",
    ", we dehomogenize by setting @xmath341 .",
    "we therefore seek nonhomogeneous polynomials @xmath342 such that the product @xmath343 has nonnegative coefficients .",
    "suppose that for @xmath52 there exists @xmath344 such that @xmath345 that is , @xmath344 is a nonhomogeneous polynomial in @xmath346 variables and multiplying by @xmath347 yields a polynomial with nonnegative coefficients .",
    "let @xmath348 where @xmath349 so that @xmath350 .",
    "we define @xmath351 for appropriately chosen coefficients @xmath352 and for @xmath115 large . for each @xmath106 between 1 and @xmath353 ,",
    "take @xmath354 . in other words , for each of these @xmath106 we simply repeat the pattern of positives and negatives from @xmath344 . for @xmath355 and @xmath356 , we take sufficiently large positive coefficients to guarantee that @xmath357 has only non - negative coefficients .    when @xmath93 , the situation is illustrated in the first diagram of figure  [ fig : newtonind ] . in the diagram ,",
    "thick circles are positive coefficients and thin circles are negative coefficients , as before . a `` row '' in the diagram corresponding to a fixed power of @xmath358 ( a fixed @xmath106 ) is marked with a thick line . finally , the shaded circles are the coefficients that contribute to a single coefficient in @xmath359 .",
    "therefore any such triangle ( or simplex in higher dimensions ) must contain a positive coefficient , as it does in our diagram . by translating this triangle",
    ", we can see the different collections of terms in @xmath58 that contribute to different monomials in @xmath101 .",
    "notice that we can not place this triangle any differently so that it includes only negative terms",
    ". further notice that on the marked `` row '' we have a diagram for @xmath53 .",
    "this is how we are using the inductive hypothesis .",
    "the diagram illustrates only what happens in the `` interior '' and not on the boundary , where @xmath355 or @xmath356 .",
    "we can now improve upon this technique ; suppose that instead of using @xmath344 that satisfied for @xmath2 we take a @xmath344 satisfying the equation for @xmath361 .",
    "we can then take @xmath362 only for _ even _",
    "@xmath106 between @xmath149 and @xmath115 and can take all @xmath352 for odd @xmath106 to be negative .",
    "after possibly making the positive coefficients larger , we conclude that @xmath339 has positive coefficients .",
    "this process is illustrated in the second diagram of figure  [ fig : newtonind ] .",
    "notice that only every second `` row '' contains positives , and that we took the positives to be closer together by exactly one on the rows that do contain positives .",
    "again by making the degree large enough we obtain a @xmath58 such that @xmath363 by repeating this procedure ( as illustrated by skipping two `` rows '' in the last diagram of figure  [ fig : newtonind ] ) we can lower @xmath2 by @xmath364 to obtain a @xmath58 such that @xmath365 picking @xmath366 we obtain a polynomial with @xmath367 let us prove @xmath368 by induction . for @xmath53 , we have seen that we can take @xmath369 .",
