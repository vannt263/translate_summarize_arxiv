    "the economic system is no doubt a many - particle system - it can be viewed as a collection of numerous interaction agents .",
    "so it is possible that methods and concepts developed in the study of strongly fluctuation systems might yield new results in this area .",
    "in fact , in the past decades the approaches from statistical physics have been applied in economics and a lot of interesting results , including empirical laws and theoretical models , have been achieved ( see @xcite and @xcite as a review of econophysics ) . among all these studies , a great deal of researchers is on the agent - based modelling and related non - trivial self - organizing phenomena . in the economic system ,",
    "the agents learn from each other , and their activities may be influenced by others actions .",
    "these interactions between agents may be simple and local , but they may have important consequence related with the emergence of global structure . to understand the mechanism behind these innovation phenomena , the methods and concepts in phase transitions and critical phenomena are helpful .",
    "for instance , in the study of majority and minority game@xcite , opinion formation@xcite , and computational ecosystems@xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the formation of labor division . roughly speaking",
    ", an economic organizational pattern is said to involve the division of labor if it allocates the labor of different individuals to different activities .",
    "hence the specialization of individuals and the number of professional activities are two sides of division of labor@xcite .",
    "it is a common functional organization observed in many complex systems , and it is a fundamental way to improve efficiency and utilization so as to get global optimization for the system . in order to investigate the mechanism behind the formation of labor division",
    ", we have constructed a simple model with many interacting agents .",
    "every agent has only two kind of tasks , namely @xmath0 and @xmath1 we describe the level of specialization of agent by his working - time share spent on producing @xmath0 or @xmath2 . each agent make their decisions for working - time in different tasks , and receive payoffs according to their and other agents choices .",
    "the agents can adapt by evaluating the performance of their strategies from past experience so as to get maximum returns .",
    "the returns for any agent is determined by its production with endogenous technical progress - through the mechanism of learning by doing , and its cooperation with other agents . just like the hamiltonian in statistical physics",
    ", the payoff function determines the behavior of the agent in economic system . because of the bounded rationality and incompleteness information in the system , we have introduced a parameter , named social temperature @xmath3 ( in the model , we have absorbed the @xmath4 into the other parameters .",
    "such an approach is traditionally used in statistical physics , for example , let @xmath5 , so the new @xmath6 in hamiltonian of ising model means @xmath7 actually . ) , to describe the degree of randomness in decision - making .",
    "then we assume that the system should obey the canonical ensemble distribution , that is the probability @xmath8 of a microstate @xmath9 is proportional to its ` boltzmann factor ' determined by the total returns of the microstate @xmath9 :    @xmath10    then using the metropolis simulation method@xcite , we can get a master equation to investigate the evolution of the system . with the continual change of system parameters , we have found a so called ` social phase transitions ' phenomenon related to the emergence of labor division .",
    "the model is defined in section 2 .",
    "the economies of specialization is introduced by increasing returns from learning by doing . and the economies of complementarity is described by an additional payoffs from the combination of two products .",
    "section 3 gives the numerical results .",
    "the effects of parameters on critical point are discussed in detail .",
    "it is revealed that although the technical progress is a key factor that determine whether or not the labor division will happen , the competitive cooperation among agents has very important effects on the critical point .",
    "our results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "let s consider a system consists of @xmath11 homogeneous agents . in a given time period @xmath3 , any agent has two different kind of tasks , namely @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in any time unit , the fraction of working time on task @xmath0 for @xmath12 agent is denoted by @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "we are interested in the long - term ( @xmath14 ) evolution of the system , especially the emerging of labor division .",
    "@xmath15 is a real number in @xmath16 $ ] , which describes the working pattern for the @xmath12 agent .",
    "if @xmath15 equals @xmath17 or @xmath18 , the agent is full specialized in @xmath0 or @xmath2 and we call the system is in complete division of labor .",
    "if @xmath15 equals @xmath19 , it means that the agent spends same time interval on tasks @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and we call it as the time - dividing working mode in the following discussion . usually @xmath15 could be any real number between @xmath18 and @xmath17 , in this case the agent does not have any preference on job @xmath0 or @xmath1we focus on the global behavior of the system . based on the above description of the agent , we introduce the following two order parameters to describe the behavior of the system on macroscopic level : @xmath20@xmath21where @xmath22 describes the intensity of labor division and cooperation in the system .",
    "it has three special values , @xmath23 , represent time - dividing working mode , every @xmath15 equals @xmath19 , no - preference working mode , @xmath15 distributed in ( 0,1 ) randomly , and full specialization , every @xmath15 equals @xmath18 or @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "@xmath24 gives the agents allocation on tasks @xmath0 and @xmath2 on global ( in average on macroscopic level ) .    in the following discussion",
    ", we try to specify a suitable evolution rule for @xmath25 based on the similar approach in statistical physics .",
    "so we can then determine the dynamical equations for @xmath26 , and get the final steady states for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "analogous with ising model in statistical physics , @xmath15 could be treated as the spin in @xmath12 point of the lattice , and then @xmath24 is the magnetization .",
    "so if we can give the hamiltonian of the system , the evolution of the system could be determined . in the economic system ,",
    "the agent switches his behavior according to his evaluations on the returns from production .",
    "every agent try to get maximum return just as any practical tends to stay in the state with lowest energy .",
    "so the payoff function from the agent s production should have the same effect as the hamiltonian . the working mode for each agent",
    "should be determined by its returns .",
    "according to the previous literatures on specialization and economic organization , we know that there are several factors that related to the division of labor , such as the increasing returns to specialization and transaction costs",
    ". in fact , limited ability on learning and incomplete information on the technology will lead to the labor division directly .",
    "but we do nt take them into account in this model . in our model ,",
    "every agent know the technology for producing @xmath0 and @xmath2 . and for any agent",
    "there is not any comparative advantages for producing @xmath0 or @xmath2 in the initial .",
    "the technical progress is achieved by the mechanism of learning by doing without any cost .",
    "the payoff function for agent @xmath29 is given by the following formulas : @xmath30where @xmath31@xmath32@xmath33 in the functions above , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the technology for producing @xmath0 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "for simplicity and without losing any generality , we assume that unit production @xmath0 will get unit return .",
    "and @xmath36 is the return of unit production @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath37 gives the additional benefits for composite @xmath0 and @xmath2 into a final product .",
    "so it is related to the less one between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "if agent @xmath29 has some more single product after the composition himself , he can also get another return , named @xmath38 , from the cooperation with other agents .",
    "but the return got from the composition with the product from other agent is factored by @xmath39 . because of the incomplete information in the system , any agent could nt know the situation of production on global . so in order to get the corresponding returns @xmath40 for every agent , we used the average - field approach similar with that in statistical physics .",
    "that means , for every agent , he will match his product with all the other agents and then the result is the average .",
    "this assumption indicate that there are already a public market in economics . in the function for @xmath38 , @xmath41 gives the surplus product @xmath2 for agent @xmath29 , and the sum of @xmath42 gives the surplus product @xmath0 of the all other agents .",
    "when these two terms have different signs , their product is negative and @xmath38 , the corresponding payoff from the cooperation , will be also negative . in this case , the surplus product of the agent is the same kind as the final surplus of all the other agents . because of the transaction cost and the diseconomies of incomplementarity , it is rationale that the agent would get negative payoff .      the way for technical progress is learning by doing .",
    "this mechanism is related to the accumulation of agent s historical production behavior .",
    "that means the development of comparative advantages is determined by related working time .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the integral working time on @xmath0 or @xmath44 for agent @xmath29 :    @xmath45    we have introduced two mechanisms for technical progress , named @xmath46-mechanism and @xmath47-mechanism .",
    "they are given by following functions : @xmath48    @xmath49    these two mechanisms will give different results .",
    "equation([gamma ] ) is an exponential function which gives unlimited growth on technology , while there is an upper limit in equation([mu ] ) .",
    "figure([g_m ] ) shows three functions for @xmath50 in our computer simulations .",
    "used in the simulations .",
    "parameters are labelled in the graph . ]      in the production function discussed above , term @xmath40 is the return from the agents cooperation .",
    "it introduces interactions among all agents ( the same as the interactions among spins ) .",
    "so if we discuss the dynamics in @xmath47-space , we should construct @xmath11 evolutionary equations for @xmath15 .",
    "but they are difficult for both theoretical analysis and computer simulation . in the following discussion",
    ", we try to describe the evolution of the system in @xmath51-space .",
    "that is to discuss the evolutionary behavior of the joint density function @xmath52 in the space sponsored by @xmath53 .",
    "then the total production for the system is : @xmath54where @xmath55 is the production of agent @xmath29 given by eq(single ) .",
    "the same as the approach of critical dynamics in ising model , the master equation for the joint density function @xmath56 in @xmath51 space is @xmath57% \\end{array } \\label{master}\\]]where @xmath58 is the transition probability which is determined by the boltzman factors as the following : @xmath59 in the above transition probabilities , @xmath60 is the change of returns related to the variation of working mode for @xmath12 agent . from eq.([total ] ) we can get @xmath61% \\end{array}%\\]]with the master equation([master ] ) and certain initial conditions , we can get evolving behaviors of @xmath22 and @xmath24 . then we can discuss the phenomena on labor division .",
    "it is difficult to have some theoretical results .",
    "so in the next section we will show some numerical simulation results by monte carlo simulation method .",
    "based on the master equation([master ] ) and corresponding transition probability([jump ] ) , the simulation is proceed on the following metropolis algorithm :    1 .",
    "for any given state with @xmath15 for agent @xmath29 , a new state @xmath62 is randomly selected ; 2 .   if @xmath63 , then the transition from @xmath15 to @xmath62 is proceeded ; 3 .   if @xmath64 , then a random number @xmath65 is selected .",
    "if @xmath66 , the transition from @xmath15 to @xmath62 is proceeded or else the agent @xmath29 keeps the original state .",
    "4 .   for another agent @xmath67 ,",
    "goto step 1 .    for any given initial state ,",
    "the system will achieve a certain steady state after some transient process .",
    "figure([lambda - t ] ) gives a typical evolution behavior under @xmath68 mechanism .",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 . ]",
    "there are several parameters related to the mechanism of labor division in the model",
    ". we will show the simple or maybe trivial results of @xmath46-mechanism first and then emphasize our discussion on the results of @xmath47-mechanism .",
    "and we let @xmath71 in all the simulations before we discuss the effects of parameters @xmath72 and @xmath11 on the system evolution in the end .      as shown in([ggamma ] ) because of @xmath46-mechanism is described by an exponential function , the system will achieve the state of labor division for any given initial state and @xmath74 no matter how small is @xmath75 .",
    "that means if the intensity of technical progress is big enough , the agent would definitely specialized in a kind of task .",
    "other factors such as competitive cooperation described by parameter @xmath76 have no effects on the long term evolution .     in the final stationary state as a function of parameter @xmath77 under @xmath77-mechanism .",
    "the final steady state of the system is determined by @xmath78 or @xmath79 . ]",
    "but for the model with @xmath47-mechanism , @xmath81 has some important effects on the system evolution . as shown in figure([betamu ] ) , there are phase transitions results in labor division and @xmath81 has strong effects on the critical point @xmath82 for parameter @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath83 decreases as the @xmath84 increasing .",
    "the @xmath68-mechanism for learning by doing gives a logistic growth for technology .",
    "that is much more realistic than the @xmath85-mechanism .",
    "the results reveal that the competitive cooperation among agents is very important for the emergence of labor division . however , as discussed in the end of this section , when @xmath86 , that is there is no mechanism of increasing returns , the system has no phase transition to labor division .",
    "this result is rationale for the model and it is consistent with the theory on specialization .",
    "the comparative advantages in production can only be introduced by a positive feedback caused by increasing returns .",
    "so the mechanism of learning by doing is a dominant factor for labor division .",
    ", parameter @xmath87 in the final stationary state as a function of parameter @xmath80 under @xmath80-mechanism .",
    "there is phase transition in the system .",
    "@xmath88 has strongly effects on the critical point . ]    in order to investigate the effects of all terms in production function in detail , we have simulated some special cases .",
    "the first case is @xmath89 .",
    "then @xmath37 and @xmath40 in equation ( single ) are all zero and technical progress is the only one factor that affects the final results . as shown in figure([no_beta ] ) , there is a phase transition in the system . under the given conditions , the critical point for @xmath68 ( @xmath82 ) is around 50 .",
    "-mechanism and without the term @xmath90 that is the payoff from the cooperation among agents , parameter @xmath91 in the final stationary state as a function of parameter @xmath80 for different parameter @xmath92 .",
    "the critical point @xmath93 is much larger than that in fig .",
    "4 and even in fig . 6 . ]",
    "then we have simulated the model with @xmath37 but no @xmath94 .",
    "the results are shown in ( [ no_eco ] ) .",
    "when @xmath95 is greater than a critical value @xmath96 , the system will stabilized in the state with @xmath97 .",
    "that is @xmath98 for any agent @xmath29 .",
    "every agent does the tasks @xmath0 and @xmath2 himself and spends the same time on both tasks .",
    "the system is in the time - dividing working mode . only when @xmath99 is smaller than @xmath96 , does the system have phase transition to labor division . but the critical value @xmath83 is much larger than that of in figure ( [ betamu ] ) .",
    "it is even larger than the @xmath83 in figure ( [ no_beta ] ) .",
    "so the term @xmath37 has the effect of anti - specialization . from the simulation results in figure ( [ betamu ] ) and",
    "just as we have indicated in the beginning of this section , @xmath38 is helpful to labor division .",
    "actually the term @xmath38 is the benefit for agent @xmath29 get from the cooperation with all the other agents .",
    "it should has the same effect as the decreasing of transaction costs .",

    "the critical point @xmath93 is much larger than that in fig .",
    "another interesting case is the system without technical progress , that is @xmath100 and @xmath35 are all equal 1 . in this case , the system is exactly the same as ising model .",
    "let @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then the total returns for the system is    @xmath103    where @xmath104 .",
    "the distribution of the state for the system is determined by @xmath105 . comprising with ising model ,",

    "that is an anti - ferromagnetic ising model with global interaction .",
    "the similar approach shows that this system either doest have phase transition related to labor division .",

    "the system has no phase transition . ]",
    "parameter @xmath111 reflects the preference for tasks @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",

    "the phase curves for different @xmath11 are almost consistent .",
    "it has only some effects on the accurate of simulation .",
    "second , when @xmath118 in @xmath119-mechanism for technical progress , the productivity declines with the time evolution .",
    "then the system could not reach the state of specialization .",
    "this result is also meaningful for real economic system .     in the final stationary state as a function of parameter @xmath80 for different @xmath110 . ]",

    "a distinctive feature of the organization of a human society is the division of labor . from the classical economic theory[11 ] , the division of labor comes from the development of endogenous comparative advantages .",
    "so there is the intrinsic relationship between technical progress and the evolution of the division of labor . but",
    "how and why it emerges from the system consists of identical individuals ?",
    "we have studied the formation of labor division by the approach of statistical physics .",
    "the results reveal that there is a phase transition with this pattern formation .",
