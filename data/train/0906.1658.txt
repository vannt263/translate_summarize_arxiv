    "one of momentous issues regarding the evolution of intergalactic medium ( igm ) is the ionization history of the universe , which significantly influences the galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite showed , using the sdss sample , that the bright - end slope of the quasar luminosity function at @xmath12 are considerably shallower than that at low - redshifts , and they concluded that quasars can not maintain the ionization of igm at @xmath12 .",
    "subsequently , a lot of arguments have been concentrated on the possibility that the igm is ionized mainly by uv radiation from high-@xmath8 star - forming galaxies like lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and lyman @xmath13 emitters ( laes ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the estimate of the contribution of lbgs or laes suffers significantly from the ambiguity regarding the escape fractions of ionizing photons from star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "observationally , the escape fractions of ionizing photons are assessed by the relative escape fractions @xmath14 , using the flux ratio at 1500  @xmath7 to 900  @xmath7 , @xmath15 , which are defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the line - of - sight opacity of the igm for 900  @xmath7 photons .",
    "normally , the intrinsic luminosity ratio at 1500  @xmath7 to 900  @xmath7 , @xmath18 , is assumed to be 3 as a fiducial value .",
    "@xcite found @xmath19 from the composite spectrum of 29 lbgs at @xmath20 , and @xcite and @xcite estimated the upper limit of @xmath21 for some lbgs at @xmath22 .",
    "the direct detection of ionizing photons from high-@xmath8 star - forming galaxies has been accomplished recently as a consequence of intensive and continuous exertion .",
    "@xcite detected the escaping ionizing photons from 2 lbgs in the ssa22 field at @xmath23 and they estimated the average relative escape fraction @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , @xcite successfully detected the lyman continuum emission from 10 laes and 7 lbgs within 197 samples of laes and lbgs in the ssa22 field .",
    "they have shown that the mean value of relative escape fractions for 7 lbgs is 0.11 after a correction for dust extinction , and can be 0.20 if igm extinction is taken into account .",
    "theoretically , the accurate estimation of escape fractions requires the three - dimensional ( 3d ) radiative transfer calculations of ionizing photons traveling in inhomogeneous interstellar medium .",
    "such 3d radiative transfer calculations are fairly recent attempts , because a great deal of computations are demanded .",
    "first , @xcite calculated the escape fractions in simple model clouds , where the density distributions are smoothed gaussian or fractally inhomogeneous . more recently , using gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation , the escape fractions are estimated by solving 3d radiative transfer .",
    "@xcite have found that the escape fractions decline from several per cent at @xmath25 to 0.01 - 0.02 at @xmath26 , due to higher gas clumping at lower redshifts .",
    "but , in these simulations , the effects of dust extinction are not taken into account .",
    "@xcite performed a cosmological simulation on the formation of a disk - like galaxy that provides the three - dimensional distributions of absorbing gas in and around the galaxy .",
    "then , 3d radiative transfer was solved including the dust extinction . as a result ,",
    "the escape fractions turned out to be as low as a few per cent . in this model , the bulk of stars is embedded deep inside the optically - thick hi disk and therefore most of ionizing photons emitted from hot stars are absorbed by neutral hydrogen in the hi disk .",
    "only a small fraction of ionizing photons from the stars that are located near the edge of disk can escape from the galaxy .",
    "hence , almost regardless of the effects of dust extinction , the resultant escape fractions become quite small .",
    "it implies that star - forming galaxies can not give a significant contribution to the igm ionization at @xmath27 . for higher redshift @xmath28",
    ", on the other hand , some numerical simulations have already shown that large escape fractions of some tens per cent are possible for low - mass galaxies , which include pop iii stars @xcite . however , in order to assess the contribution of laes and lbgs observed at @xmath29 to igm reionization , we should evaluate the uv escape fractions from more massive galaxies .",
    "the escape of uv photons can sensitively depend on the gravitational potential ( whalen et al .",

    "also , dust extinction should be taken into account in such primordial galaxies . in this paper",

    "as a model galaxy , we adopt the high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations ( @xmath34 fixed cartesian grids ) by @xcite , which are coupled with the collisionless dynamics for dark matter particles as well as star particles and also the chemical enrichment .",

    "we obtain the ionization structure assuming the ionization equilibrium , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the photo - ionization rate , the collisional ionization rate and the recombination rate to all excited states , respectively .",

    "supernova - driven shocks collide with each other to generate large - scale hot ( @xmath70 k ) bubbles reaching a higher ionization degree . at @xmath36 gyr , roughly 50 per cent of the total volume",
    "is highly ionized with @xmath71 , where the ionization degree is controlled by the collisional ionization by shock heating and the photo - ionization by uv radiation from hot young stars .",

    "as a result , more than 80 per cent of volume is occupied with highly ionized gas with @xmath75 .",

    ", we have found that the escape fractions are reduced to be @xmath106 at @xmath35 gyr and @xmath107 at @xmath38 gyr .",
    "this implies that the collisional ionization by shocks can contribute to enhance the escape fractions by a factor of two .",

    "in addition , some of the detected galaxies show significant spatial offsets of ionizing radiation from non - ionizing uv emission .",
    "the spatial distributions of interstellar dust are highly inhomogeneous in laes , because it should follow the inhomogeneous heavy - element distributions ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "we have found that an order - of - magnitude increase in the escape fractions can be attributed to the diffuse distribution of stars , while the collisional ionization further raises them by some factor .",

    "<S> in order to assess the contribution of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) at redshifts @xmath0 to the ionization of intergalactic medium ( igm ) , we investigate the escape fractions of ionizing photons from supernova - dominated primordial galaxies by solving the three - dimensional radiative transfer . the model galaxy is employed from an ultra - high - resolution chemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by mori & umemura ( 2006 ) , which well reproduces the observed properties of laes and lbgs . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of model galaxy is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we solve not only photo - ionization but also collisional ionization by shocks . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , according to the chemical enrichment , we incorporate the effect of dust extinction , taking the size distributions of dust into account . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we find that dust extinction reduces the escape fractions by a factor @xmath2 in the lae phase and by a factor @xmath3 in the lbg phase , while the collisional ionization by shocks increases the escape fractions by a factor @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant escape fractions are @xmath5 in the lae phase and @xmath6 in the lbg phase . </S>",
    "<S> these results are well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at 1500  @xmath7 to 900  @xmath7 of laes and lbgs . combining the resultant escape fractions with the luminosity functions of laes and lbgs </S>",
    "<S> , we find that high-@xmath8 laes and lbgs can ionize the igm at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> however , ionizing radiation from laes as well as lbgs falls short to ionize the igm at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> that implies that additional ionization sources may required at @xmath10 .    </S>",
