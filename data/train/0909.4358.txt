    "historically , the @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 decay , also known as @xmath2 , provided an early strong confirmation of the @xmath6 nature of the electroweak interaction . at present , thanks to exceptionally well controlled theoretical uncertainties , its branching ratio is understood at the level of better than one part in @xmath7 .",
    "the most recent independent theoretical calculations are in very good agreement and give : @xmath8 where @xmath9 indicates that radiative decays are included .",
    "marciano and sirlin @xcite and finkemeier @xcite took into account radiative corrections , higher order electroweak leading logarithms , short - distance qcd corrections , and structure - dependent effects , while cirigliano and rosell @xcite used the two - loop chiral perturbation theory .",
    "a number of exotic processes outside of the current standard model ( sm ) can produce deviations from the above predictions , mainly through induced pseudoscalar ( ps ) currents .",
    "prime examples are : charged higgs in theories with richer higgs sector than the sm , ps leptoquarks in theories with dynamical symmetry breaking , certain classes of vector leptoquarks , loop diagrams involving certain susy partner particles , as well as non - zero neutrino masses and their mixing ( ref .  @xcite gives a recent review of the subject ) . in this sense",
    ", @xmath2 decay provides complementary information to direct searches for new physics at modern colliders .",
    "the two most recent measurements of the branching ratio are mutually consistent : @xmath10 and dominate the world average of @xmath11 , which , however , is less accurate than the theoretical calculations by a factor of 40 .",
    "the pen experiment @xcite is aiming to reduce this gap and , in doing so , to set new limits on the above non - sm processes .",
    "the pen experiment uses an upgraded version of the pibeta detector system , described in detail in ref .",
    "the pibeta collaboration performed a series of rare pion and muon decay measurements @xcite .",
    "the pen apparatus consists of a large - acceptance ( @xmath12sr ) electromagnetic shower calorimeter ( pure csi , 12 radiation lengths thick ) with non - magnetic tracking in concentric cylindrical multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpc1,2 ) and plastic scintillator hodoscope ( ph ) , surrounding a plastic scintillator active target ( at ) .",
    "beam pions pass through an upstream detector ( bc ) , have their energy reduced in the wedged active degrader ( wad ) , and stop in the target .",
    "combining the signals from the four wedges ( a horizontal pair and a vertical pair ) of the wad provides information on the @xmath13-@xmath14 position of the beam pion as it reaches the at .",
    "signals from the beam detectors ( bc , wad , and at ) are digitized in a 2gs / s waveform digitizer .",
    "figure [ fig : pen_det_res ] shows the layout of the main detector components .",
    "the primary method of evaluating the @xmath2 branching ratio , as outlined in the experiment proposal @xcite , is to normalize the observed yield of @xmath3@xmath4@xmath15@xmath16  decays in a high - threshold calorimeter energy trigger ( ht ) to the number of sequential decays @xmath3@xmath4@xmath17@xmath4@xmath15  in an all - inclusive pre - scaled trigger ( pt ) . to be accepted in either trigger",
    ", an event must contain the positron signal within a 250ns gate which starts about 40ns before the pion stop time .",
    "the @xmath2 events are isolated and counted within the ht data sample via their 26ns exponential decay time distribution with respect to the pion - stop time reference . on the other hand",
    ", the pt provides the corresponding number of sequential @xmath3@xmath4@xmath17@xmath4@xmath15  decays , again via their well defined time distribution with respect to the @xmath3 stop time . finally , by analyzing the beam counter waveform digitizer data we separate @xmath2 events ( two pulses in the target waveform : pion stop and decay positron ) , from the sequential decay events ( three pulses in the target waveform , produced by the pion , muon and positron , respectively ) .",
    "thus identified @xmath2 events serve to map out the energy response function of the calorimeter , enabling us to evaluate the low energy `` tail , '' not accessible in the ht data",
    ". a measure of the performance of the beam detectors , and of the current state of the art of the waveform analysis is given in fig .",

    "fig : tgt_wavfrms ] , title=\"fig : \" ]      two engineering runs were completed , in 2007 and 2008 , respectively .",
    "all detector systems are performing to specifications , and @xmath21 @xmath2 events were collected .",
    "the experiment will continue with a major run in 2009 , which is intended to double the existing data sample .",
    "prior to the run , the wedged degrader will be replaced by a single thin degrader , and a mini time projection chamber ( mini - tpc ) .",
    "the position resolution , @xmath2212 mm , achieved using the wad , is limited by pion multiple scattering in the wedges .",
    "the new system will improve the beam position resolution by about an order of magnitude , with the mini - tpc adding excellent directional resolution , as well .",
    "both are needed to achieve improved systematics and better control of decays in flight .",
