    "the electromagnetic transitions for @xmath1=3 nuclear systems have been extensively studied by several research groups ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the advantage of investigating these processes is that nowadays several methods can provide accurate bound- and scattering - state wave functions using realistic hamiltonian models .",
    "therefore , different models for the nuclear electromagnetic current operator can be tested with the large body of available experimental data . in the present study ,",
    "we concentrate our attention on the @xmath0 radiative capture reaction in a wide range of center - of - mass energy ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this reaction was already studied below the deuteron breakup threshold by our group in ref .",
    "@xcite , using pair - correlated hyperspherical harmonics ( phh ) wave functions obtained from a realistic hamiltonian model consisting of the argonne @xmath3 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana ix three - nucleon  @xcite interactions ( av18/uix ) .",
    "the nuclear electromagnetic current operator included , in addition to the one - body term , also two - body contributions , constructed following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the goal of satisfying the current conservation relation ( ccr ) with the av18 .",
    "however , within this method , the two - body terms originated from the momentum - dependent part of the av18 were not strictly conserved .",
    "the @xmath0 radiative capture observables were all quite well reproduced with the `` full '' model for the nuclear current operator , with the only exception of the deuteron tensor polarization observables @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was concluded that these discrepancies might be due to the fact that the electromagnetic current operator satisfies the ccr with the nuclear hamiltonian only approximately .    in this work we present a new model for the nuclear current operator",
    "constructed so as to satisfy _ exactly _ the ccr with the av18/uix hamiltonian model , and we test it in the study of the @xmath0 radiative capture observables in a wide range of @xmath2 .",
    "the model for the nuclear electromagnetic current operator is summarized in the following section .",
    "a detailed review will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear electromagnetic current operator can be written as sum of one- and many - body terms that operate on the nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "the one - body operator is derived from the non - relativistic reduction of the covariant single - nucleon current , by expanding in powers of @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the nucleon mass  @xcite . to construct the two - body current operator , it is useful to adopt the classification scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , and separate the current into model - independent ( mi ) and model - dependent ( md ) parts .",
    "the md two - body current is purely transverse and therefore is un - constrained by the ccr .",
    "it is taken to consist of the isoscalar @xmath8 and isovector @xmath9 transition currents , as well as the isovector current associated with excitation of intermediate @xmath10 resonances as in ref .",
    "the mi two - body currents have longitudinal components and have to satisfy the ccr with the two - nucleon interaction .",
    "the mi terms arising from the momentum - independent terms of the av18 two - nucleon interaction have been constructed following the standard procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , hereafter quoted as meson - exchange ( me ) scheme .",
    "it can be shown that these two - body current operators satisfy _ exactly _ the ccr with the first six operators of the av18 .",
    "the two - body currents arising from the spin - orbit components of the av18 could be constructed using again me mechanisms  @xcite , but the resulting currents turn out to be not strictly conserved .",
    "the same can be said of those currents from the quadratic momentum - dependent components of the av18 , if obtained , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by gauging only the momentum operators , but ignoring the implicit momentum dependence which comes through the isospin exchange operator ( see below ) . since our goal is to construct mi two - body currents which satisfy _ exactly _ the ccr with the complete av18 two - nucleon interaction , the currents arising from the momentum - dependent terms of the av18 interaction have been obtained following the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , which will be quoted as minimal - substitution ( ms ) scheme .",
    "the main idea of this procedure , fully reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the isospin operator @xmath11 is formally equivalent to an implicit momentum dependence  @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of the space - exchange operator ( @xmath12 ) using the formula @xmath13 , valid when operating on antisymmetric wave functions .",
    "note that the operator @xmath12 is defined as @xmath14 , where the @xmath15-operators do not act on the vectors @xmath16 in the exponential . in the presence of an electromagnetic field , minimal substitution is performed both in the momentum dependent terms of the two - nucleon interaction and in the space - exchange operator @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting current operators are then obtained with standard procedures  @xcite .",
    "explicit formulas can also be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    both the me and the ms schemes can be generalized to calculate the three - body current operators induced by the three - nucleon interaction ( tni ) . here",
    ", these three - body currents have been constructed within the me scheme to satisfy the ccr with the urbana - ix tni  @xcite .",
    "details of the calculation can be found in ref",
    ".  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the present model for the many - body current operators retains the two - body terms obtained within the me scheme from the momentum - independent part of the av18 , those ones obtained within the ms scheme from the momentum - dependent part of the av18 , the md terms quoted above , and the three - body terms obtained within the me scheme from the uix tni .",
    "thus , the full current operator satisfies _ exactly _ the ccr with the av18/uix nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite retains only two - body currents , all of them obtained within the me scheme .",
    "radiative capture at @xmath172.00 mev , obtained with the av18/uix hamiltonian model .",
    "see text for the explanations of the different curves .",
    "the experimental data are from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    , but at @xmath173.33 mev .",
    "the experimental data are from ref .",
    "the theoretical predictions of the @xmath0 radiative capture observables at @xmath172.009.86 mev obtained with the av18/uix hamiltonian model are compared with the available experimental data in figs .  [",
    "fig : obs.2.00]  [ fig : obs.6.60 - 9.86 ] . in all the figures ,",
    "the dashed , dotted - dashed and thick - solid curves correspond to the calculation with one - body only , with one- and two - body , and with one- , two- and three - body currents . also shown ( thin - solid lines ) are the results obtained with the model for the nuclear current operator of ref .",
    "@xcite . from inspection of the figures",
    ", we can conclude that : ( i ) the present `` full '' model for the nuclear electromagnetic current operator provides an overall nice description for all the observables , with the only exception of the deuteron vector analyzing powers i@xmath18 and @xmath19 at small center - of - mass angles .",
    "the origin of these discrepancies is currently under investigation .",
    "a possible explanation could be a deficiency in the used model for the tni , in particular in the absence of three - nucleon spin - orbit terms  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) some small three - body current effects are noticeable , especially in the deuteron tensor polarization observables @xmath4 , @xmath5 at @xmath172.00 and 3.33 mev and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath175.83 mev .",
    "this is an indication of the fact that if a hamiltonian model with two- and three - nucleon interactions is used , then the model for the nuclear current operator should include the corresponding two- and three - body contributions .",
    "( iii ) the results obtained with the model of ref .",
    "@xcite are in strong disagreement with the data for the deuteron tensor polarization observables .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in ref .",
    "@xcite the ccr is only approximately satisfied .",
    "however , this `` old '' model seems to provide a better description for the deuteron vector polarization observables i@xmath18 and @xmath23 .    5.83 mev .",
    "the experimental data are from ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "radiative capture at @xmath176.60 mev ( left panel ) and 9.86 mev ( right panel ) .",
    "the experimental data are from ref .",

    "these calculations use accurate bound and scattering state wave functions obtained with the phh technique from the argonne @xmath3 two - nucleon and urbana ix three - nucleon interactions . the model for the electromagnetic current operator includes one- , two- and three - body components , constructed so as to satisfy _ exactly _ the ccr with the given hamiltonian model .",
