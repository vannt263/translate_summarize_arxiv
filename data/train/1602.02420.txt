    "simple model hamiltonians that can capture the basic aspects of the electronic collective states observed in complex materials , such as in the cases of antiferromagnetism or superconductivity , are crucial to advance the theoretical understanding of these nontrivial phases and to interpret and guide experimental efforts .",
    "the standard hubbard and @xmath8 models have successfully allowed for the study of the properties of antiferromagnetic compounds in the undoped limit  @xcite while the negative-@xmath1 hubbard model is a useful tool for the study of canonical @xmath4-wave superconductors , from the bcs regime in weak coupling to the realm of bose - einstein condensation in its strong coupling limit.@xcite the discovery of @xmath2-wave superconductivity in the high @xmath7 cuprates created the need for an equivalent simple hamiltonian to analyze @xmath2-wave condensates.@xcite while it is widely believed that upon doping both the hubbard and @xmath8 models develop @xmath2-wave superconductivity , this regime is difficult to study because the signals of superconductivity may be hidden by other more dominant energy scales such as the superexchange @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , numerically the evidence for long - range order superconductivity in these models is rather weak in realistic regimes of couplings . on the contrary , for the negative @xmath1 hubbard model , even in small systems such as @xmath10 lattices , the @xmath4-wave pairing tendencies are already clearly apparent.@xcite    for these reasons ,",
    "several efforts have been devoted to develop the analogous of the negative-@xmath1 hubbard model but for @xmath2-wave superconductors.@xcite the simplest approach is based on the single orbital case , to keep the number of degrees of freedom to a minimum .",
    "this rational is based on the fact that one single band , albeit composed of hybridized oxygen @xmath11 and copper @xmath2 orbitals , does define the fermi surface of the high @xmath7 cuprates",
    ". however , in this case of a single orbital system , a pairing operator with @xmath2-wave symmetry has to locate the two electrons that form the cooper pair in two different lattice sites , as opposed to the negative-@xmath1 @xmath4-wave pairing operator that describes a rotationally invariant pair of electrons with opposite spin on a single lattice site . while an attractive on - site potential readily allows the formation of on - site cooper pairs in the negative-@xmath1 hubbard model , interactions that bond electrons in nearest neighbor sites , as required for @xmath2-wave pairing , may induce the formation of extended clusters of carriers that eventually can lead to phase separation rather than superconductivity , as argued in previous work.@xcite it",
    "is believed that by fine tuning parameters , or including the effects of long - range coulomb repulsion , eventually pairing can be stabilized , but these interactions lead to models that are difficult to study .",
    "in addition , hamiltonians where short range attraction competes with long - range repulsion could also form complex structures such as stripes that may compete with pairing.@xcite while magnetism is considered a crucial factor in the mechanism that generates @xmath2-wave pairing in the cuprates,@xcite finding a simple effective model involving only charge and spin degrees of freedom that readily displays robust @xmath2-wave superconductivity remains ellusive .",
    "the discovery of high @xmath7 superconductivity in the iron - based pnictides and selenides has provided a novel playground to investigate the potentially crucial role played by having many simultaneously active degrees of freedom involved in the mechanism of superconductivity.@xcite while there are indications of either @xmath4- or @xmath2-wave symmetry in the superconducting order parameter of representative members of this family of compounds , it is clear that the orbital degree of freedom must be included in the theoretical description .",
    "in fact , at least three @xmath2-orbitals contribute to determine the fermi surfaces .",
    "when these orbital degrees of freedom are included , it is sometimes forgotten that they themselves contribute to determine the symmetry of the order parameters .",
    "in fact , the pairing operators for the pnictides are classified according to both their spatial and orbital symmetry",
    "properties.@xcite    the key observation in this publication is that the addition of the orbital degree of freedom allows for the possibility of developing _ on - site _ pairing operators whose symmetry is non trivial , namely non @xmath4-wave .",
    "more specifically , in this publication we will explicitly show that an on - site pairing operator with @xmath2-wave ( @xmath3 ) symmetry can be constructed for a two - orbital system with hybridized bands on a square lattice .",
    "moreover , we show that on - site inter - orbital pairing tendencies can be generated via an on - site interorbital attraction and an effectively antiferromagnetic `` hund coupling '' term .",
    "the strength of the attraction and effective hund coupling is tuned with a single parameter @xmath12 which in turn determines the strength of the superconducting order .",
    "we believe that the weak coupling regime of this model will allow for the study of the properties of generic @xmath2-wave superconductors in the same manner that the bcs limit can be studied with the negative @xmath1 hubbard model , while the strong coupling limit will unveil a novel unexplored regime where a bose condensation of @xmath2-wave pairs dominates . in other words , all the fruitfull investigations carried out in the past for the negative @xmath1 hubbard model can be now revisited employing a novel model with robust @xmath2-wave pairing , opening a broad avenue of research .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the hamiltonian for the new multiorbital @xmath2-wave model is presented .",
    "a mean - field study of the hamiltonian is performed in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the exact diagonalization of the model in a small cluster and the calculation of the @xmath2-wave and @xmath4-wave pairing correlations .",
    "a final discussion of the main results is presented in section v.",
    "the tight - binding term of the multiorbital @xmath2-wave model ( dubbed the md model ) introduced here results from applying the slater - koster  @xcite method to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath2-orbitals using a square lattice .",
    "it is well known that these are the two orbitals of relevance in the colossal magnetoresistive manganites.@xcite also several authors have considered these two same orbitals to model the cuprates : despite the fact that only one band of mostly @xmath5 character determines the fermi surface , in practice this band is at least weakly hybridized with the @xmath6 orbital.@xcite using the slater - koster formalism we obtain @xmath13 where @xmath14 creates an electron at site @xmath15 , orbital @xmath16 , and with spin projection @xmath17 .",
