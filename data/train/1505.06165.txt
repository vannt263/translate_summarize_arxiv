    "the origin and nature of @xmath0and its violation remains a mystery both within and beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in addressing the question of @xmath0it",
    "was observed some time ago that phases which appear in the yukawa matrices for example are not robust indicators of @xmath0violation since their appearance is dependent on the choice of basis . on the other hand",
    ", physical @xmath0violating observables only depend on particular combinations of yukawa matrices which are invariant under different choices of basis .",
    "such weak basis invariants , which have the property that they are zero if @xmath0is conserved and non - zero if @xmath0is violated therefore provide unambiguous signals of @xmath0violation which are closely related to experimentally measurable quantities .",
    "the use of such @xmath0-odd weak - basis invariants ( cpis ) , rather than particular phases in a given basis , is generally referred to as the invariant approach ( ia ) to @xmath0violation .    in the ia to @xmath0violation @xcite ,",
    "one starts by separating the full lagrangian of the theory in two parts , one denoted @xmath4 that is known to conserve @xmath0 , typically the kinetic terms and pure gauge interactions @xcite ,- like transformations that include a family symmetry transformation was introduced in @xcite , in an attempt to obtain a connection between quark masses and mixing angles . ] and the remaining lagrangian , denoted @xmath5 .",
    "the crucial point is that @xmath4 allows for many different @xmath0transformations and as a result , @xmath0is violated if and only if none of these @xmath0transformations leaves @xmath5 invariant . in the case of the sm",
    ", @xmath4 includes the gauge interactions and the kinetic energy terms , while the relevant components of @xmath5 are the yukawa interactions . using the ia",
    ", one can readily derive @xcite some specific conditions that the yukawa couplings have to satisfy in order to have @xmath0invariance .",
    "it is well known that the yukawa couplings in the sm have a large redundancy which results from the freedom that one has to make redefinitions of the fermion fields which leave the gauge interactions invariant but change e.g. the quark yukawa couplings @xmath6 , @xmath7 without changing the physics .",
    "the great advantage of the ia is that it allows one to derive cpis which , if non - vanishing , imply @xmath0violation . in the sm , it has been shown @xcite that the relevant cpi is @xmath8^ 3 $ ] , where we define the hermitian combinations @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for the 3 fermion generation case this cpi leads to the jarlskog invariant @xcite .",
    "the ia can be applied to any extension of the sm , in particular to extensions of the sm with majorana neutrinos @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasised that the ia not only enables one to verify whether a given lagrangian violates @xmath0 , but also provides an idea of how suppressed @xmath0violation might be .",
    "a notable example is the possibility of showing why @xmath0 in the sm is too small to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "one simply observes that the dimensionless number @xmath11^ 3 / v^{12}$ ] is of order @xmath12 , where we used the hermitian quark mass matrices and @xmath13 gev denotes the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this dimensionless number should be compared to the size of observed bau , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the ia , leading to basis invariant quantities , also identifies what combination of parameters are physical such that , e.g. there is no need to count how many phases can be eliminated through rephasing , which can be laborious in complicated lagrangian , and specially in the presence of family symmetries .",
    "recently @xcite the use of cpis , valid for any choice of @xmath0transformation , was advocated as a powerful approach to studying specific models of @xmath0violation in the presence of discrete family symmetries .",
    "examples based on @xmath15 and @xmath1 family symmetries were discussed and it was shown how to obtain several known results in the literature .",
    "in addition , the ia was used to identify how explicit ( rather than spontaneous ) @xmath0violation arises , which is geometrical in nature , i.e. persisting for arbitrary couplings in the lagrangian .    here",
    "we intend both to further highlight the usefulness of the ia in dealing with discrete family symmetries and also to systematically explore the @xmath0properties of @xmath1 . by using the ia ,",
    "we are able to construct cpis independently of the specific group and need to consider the group details only to compute coupling matrices by using the respective clebsch - gordan coefficients in any particular basis . by combining the coupling matrices with the cpis ,",
    "basis - independent quantities are obtained which indicate if there is @xmath0violation .    in this paper",
    "we explore in depth the @xmath0properties of unbroken @xmath1 invariant lagrangians using the ia as outlined in @xcite ( see also the proceedings @xcite ) .",
    "the method is based on @xcite .",
    "we focus on @xmath1 since it involves many features which may be encountered in more general discrete groups , such as complex representations and multiple non - trivial singlet representations .",
    "it therefore constitutes a rich playground for exploring the ia in the case of discrete family symmetries .",
    "although the cases discussed do not represent realistic models , since the @xmath1 is unbroken , the work here lays the foundation for future models based on spontaneously broken @xmath1 .    following the ia we consider several cases that highlight how the @xmath0properties depend both on the field content and on the type of contractions considered ( which may be controlled e.g. by additional symmetries ,",
    "even though here we do nt always consider those explicitly ) .",
    "we focus on tri - linears terms , which we refer to as yukawa - like couplings , keeping in mind that most ( but not all ) cases considered are meant as fermion - fermion - scalar terms .",
    "we start by considering lagrangians with just @xmath1 singlets where the ia identifies the relative phases that are physical , and then concentrate on yukawa - like terms involving a triplet , an anti - triplet , and a singlet .    when the yukawa - like couplings are between triplet , anti - triplet and singlet , we study cases with a single independent triplet , with independent triplet and anti - triplet , and with three or more independent 3-dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "some of the cases considered are similar to adding @xmath1 to a type ii 2 higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) or @xmath16 higgs doublet model ( nhdm ) . for each of these frameworks",
    "the ia allows to identify if the lagrangian has the possibility to explicitly violate @xmath0 , how this depends on how many different @xmath1 singlets are coupled , and what cpis are relevant and non - vanishing when there is @xmath0violation .",
    "this serves to further illustrate the convenience and power of the ia for the study of @xmath0properties of specific lagrangians .",
    "the layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in section  [ ia ]",
    "we briefly review the ia to @xmath0 in family symmetry models .",
    "we continue with the group theory of @xmath1 in section  [ d27 ] .",
    "section  [ singlets ] considers just singlets . in section  [ one ]",
    "the field content includes one triplet .",
    "two triplets are considered in detail in section  [ 2triplets ] , where we differentiate also based on the number and type of singlets present .",
    "we generalise to three triplets in section  [ three ] and to four and more triplets in appendix [ sec:4more ] . for comparison with the ia",
    ", we present some examples of specific @xmath0matrices in appendix [ spe ] . finally we conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the ia as outlined in @xcite is based on @xcite , where to study the @xmath0properties of a given lagrangian one starts by splitting it @xmath17 where @xmath4 denotes the part that is known to conserve @xmath0(kinetic terms and gauge interactions , as pure gauge interactions conserve @xmath0@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath5 includes non - gauge interactions such as the yukawa couplings .",
    "a review of how the ia is applied to the standard model ( sm ) lepton sector can be found in @xcite , which also includes its application to a model of spontaneously broken @xmath15 and to a model of @xmath1 which features explicit geometrical @xmath0violation .    in this paper",
    "we study many different lagrangians invariant under unbroken @xmath1 , relying on the ia .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the presence of a family symmetry does not change the most general @xmath0transformation which leaves invariant @xmath4 - these are the kinetic terms and the gauge terms which are flavour blind . before continuing with the ia ,",
    "a relevant question is what role is played by the consistency relations @xcite in this type of analysis .",
    "the consistency relations can be obtained by considering that a lagrangian invariant under both a family symmetry and a @xmath0symmetry should be the same whether one considers doing a consistent @xmath0transformation before or after a family symmetry transformation .",
    "the concept is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cons ] for a field @xmath18 .",
    "transformation @xmath19 is consistent with the group @xmath20 , as following it with the transformation @xmath21 associated with element @xmath22 of @xmath20 , and then with @xmath23 , is equivalent to the transformation @xmath24 associated with some other element @xmath25 of @xmath20 .",
    "[ fig : cons],width=6 ]    when this is considered rigorously one obtains a relationship between @xmath0transformations @xmath19 and family symmetry transformations @xmath21 @xmath26 if we find an explicit @xmath0transformation that leaves the lagrangian which respects some family symmetry @xmath20 invariant ( even one is enough ) then we can be quite sure that the theory conserves @xmath0as well as respecting the @xmath20 . in this case",
    "the consistency relation in eq.[eq : consistency ] is automatically satisfied .",
    "this is clear since under a @xmath0transformation , followed by a family symmetry transformation , followed by another @xmath0transformation , etc .",
    ", leaves the lagrangian invariant , @xmath27 the consistency of @xmath0and @xmath20 is clear since the lagrangian is left invariant at each stage .",
    "however we can be even more explicit than this in order to demonstrate the equivalence of the two approaches .",
    "consider a mass term @xmath28 in the lagrangian , then define @xmath29 suppose that the lagrangian is invariant under some family symmetry transformation , @xmath21 , then this implies that the mass term in the lagrangian remains unchanged under a family symmetry transformation and hence @xmath30 the condition for the invariance of the lagrangian under a @xmath0transformation , @xmath19 , requires that the mass term swaps with the @xmath31 mass term hence , @xmath32 taking the complex conjugate of eq.[cond00 ] we find , @xmath33 using eq.[cond0 ] for the last equality . from eq.[cond01 ] and eq.[cond0 ] we obtain , @xmath34 hence @xmath35 where we have used eq.[cond00 ] but for a different group element @xmath25 in the last equality . by comparing both sides of eq.[cond03 ] we identify , @xmath36 which is just the consistency condition in eq.[eq : consistency ] .",
    "as we further illustrate in the following sections , using the ia one need not specify a @xmath0transformation .",
    "for a given lagrangian it is sufficient to input the invariance conditions imposed by the symmetries .",
    "this makes the ia very useful to study @xmath0violation in the presence of family symmetries .",
    "the group @xmath1 @xcite , a member of the @xmath37 subgroups of @xmath38 @xcite , has featured prominently in studies related with @xmath0 .",
    "it leads to geometrical @xmath0violation as shown in @xcite and @xcite , a feature that was analysed using different methods by @xcite.violation has also been found in other groups @xcite . ]",
    "in addition , the @xmath0transformations consistent with @xmath1 triplets were presented in @xcite .    using the ia",
    ", @xcite found that a specific @xmath1 invariant lagrangian features a different type of geometrical @xmath0violation , where @xmath0is explicitly violated ( rather than spontaneously ) . in this paper",
    "we go beyond this result , considering many @xmath1 invariant lagrangians to study in depth how the interplay between @xmath1 and @xmath0changes depending on the representations and how they couple with one another .    to do so , some understanding of the group properties is required .",
    "@xmath1 has three @xmath39 generators @xcite but we only need to use two , which we refer to as @xmath40 ( for cyclic , with @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( for diagonal , with @xmath43 ) .",
    "this notation refers to their respective 3-dimensional representation matrices in the basis we use .",
    "we define @xmath44 .",
    "starting with the 9 distinct singlets which we conveniently label as @xmath45 , the generators are represented by @xmath46 and @xmath47 for that particular singlet .",
    "a field transforming as a @xmath48 ( trivial singlet ) is explicitly invariant under @xmath1 transformations , and the other 8 singlets simply get multiplied by the respective powers of @xmath49 when acted upon by @xmath40 or @xmath42 .",
    "the other irreducible representations of @xmath1 are triplets , two distinct ones which we take as @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the generator @xmath40 is represented equally for both @xmath52 @xmath42 is represented as a diagonal matrix with entries that are powers of @xmath49 , with the exponents denoted by the indices of the triplet representation @xmath53 the determinant of the matrices is 1 ( @xmath1 is a subgroup of @xmath38 ) and the two indices identify @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the representations @xmath50 and @xmath51 behave as a triplet and anti - triplet , so in analogy with @xmath38 we refer to them mostly as the @xmath56 and @xmath57 representations .",
    "the subscript notation is useful to remember the powers of @xmath49 that each component transforms with under @xmath58 so we refer to it occasionally throughout the paper , e.g. if we take @xmath59 transforming as triplet @xmath60 and @xmath61 transforming as ( anti-)triplet @xmath62 , the explicit construction of the trivial singlet is @xmath63 .",
    "this can be verified by acting on @xmath64 and @xmath65 with generators @xmath40 and @xmath42 and checking that the prescribed @xmath66 remains invariant . indeed , @xmath67 and rules for constructing the non - trivial singlets from triplet and anti - triplet follow @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 all these can be verified by acting on the triplets with the generators and tracking how each product transforms .",
    "to illustrate how the ia would proceed , we start by considering yukawa - like terms without @xmath1 triplets . throughout",

    "the next step in the ia is to consider the most general @xmath0transformation for each field consistent with the kinetic terms etc .",

    "starting with simple cases where the field content includes only 1-dimensional representations of @xmath1 ( singlets ) , the invariant approach reveals what are the relevant physical phases , which turn out to be specific relative phases of the complex couplings .",
    "we then turned to consider yukawa - like terms involving @xmath1 triplet and anti - triplet , starting with a single 3-dimensional representation ( triplet ) and progressing to two and more triplets , where it becomes helpful to refer to sectors of distinct pairs of triplet and anti - triplet .",
