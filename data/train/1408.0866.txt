    "the observation of the whole sky in the soft x - ray band , especially between 0.5 and 1 kev , has clearly showed not only enhanced emission from regions such as the galactic center and the north polar spur , but also a dimmer yet gleaming diffuse background in almost all directions .",
    "this diffuse x - ray background is considered to be produced by a combination of several sources , and a clean separation of them has been a difficult task .",
    "@xcite showed that about 40% of the dimmer all - sky diffuse emission in the 0.5  1.0 kev band can be attributed to the extragalactic contribution , which we refer to as the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) in this paper .",
    "the remainder of the emission can be characterized by highly ionized ion emission lines , which are considered to originate from at least three different sources ; the solar - wind charge - exchange ( swcx)-induced emission from the heliosphere ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the thermal emission from the hot gas in local hot bubble ( lhb ) ( @xcite ) , and another thermal emission from a thick galactic hot gaseous disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first two sources are considered to arise from the local part of the galaxy and are hard to be separated from each other .",
    "the sum of these emission components can be approximated by an optically - thin thermal plasma of @xmath4 with negligible foreground absorption ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the last component is considered to arise from distant parts of the galaxy ; mostly beyond the bulk of absorption in the galactic disk .",
    "the spectrum of the component can be described by thermal plasma of a temperature of @xmath5  kev .",
    "there is so far little constraint on the distances other than their foreground absorption .",
    "the detection of highly ionized absorption lines of o , o , and/or ne in spectra of galactic sources ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) indicates that a large fraction of hot gas contributing to the absorption exists within distance scales of @xmath6  kpc .",
    "@xcite introduced a joint fitting method of the high - resolution absorption and emission spectra to constrain not only the temperature but also the extent and density of the hot gaseous disk . in the work by yao & wang , the high - resolution absorption spectrum observed with",
    "is jointly fitted with the broadband emission spectrum from the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) of the field adjacent to the sight line toward the nearby bright active galactic nucleus mkn 421 .",
    "this joint fit provides tight constraints on the extent and density of the hot gas , which is shown to be in a nonisothermal state , as evidenced by the mean temperature differences inferred from fitting the absorption and emission spectra independently .",
    "the joint fit then assumes a model of hot gas distribution with the temperature and density decreasing exponentially with the vertical distance from the galactic plane .",
    "this exponential model was also used in the joint analysis of the _ chandra _ observed absorption spectrum along the sight line toward the lmc x3 with the _ suzaku _ observed emission spectra in the adjacent fields @xcite .",
    "this analysis gives the estimates of the temperature and density at the galactic plane as @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the exponential scale heights of the hot gas as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xcite applied the same model along the sight line toward the blazer pks 2155304 , and estimated the gas temperature and density at the galactic plane as @xmath11 and @xmath12 with the exponential scale heights of the hot gas as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , which are consistent with those for the lmc x3 direction .",
    "both results from @xcite and @xcite suggested the presence of a thick hot gaseous disk with the scale height less than 10  kpc that is consistent with the galactic source absorption lines .",
    "the galactic hot gaseous disk has also been studied for a possibility of its being a reservoir of missing baryons in the local universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore essential to constrain the scale heights of the hot gas in different parts of the sky individually .",
    "@xcite have argued that the spatial extent of the hot gas is more than 100  kpc from the joint analysis of _ chandra _ absorption spectra with the emission measure from literature , but the results are inconsistent with the galactic source absorption lines as well as previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "various issues about the data analysis and interpretation of @xcite were raised by @xcite .    in this paper , we revisit the mkn 421 direction using the _ suzaku _ observed emission spectra to jointly analyze with the absorption spectrum from _",
    "chandra_. compared to the _ rosat _ detector , the _ suzaku _ ccd has a better sensitivity and a better energy resolution to separate the hot gaseous disk from the swcx and lhb ones .    in section 2 , we describe our observations and data - reduction processes .",
    "we discuss our data analysis in section 3 , and conclude the discussion in section 4 . throughout the paper ,",
    "the statistical errors are quoted at the 90% confidence level in the text , as well as in the tables , while the 68% ( @xmath15 ) confidence errors are adopted in the figures , unless otherwise specified .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure1.eps      as one of the brightest x - ray sources , mkn 421 has been observed by _",
    "chandra _ many times , using the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) and the low - energy transmission grating ( letg ) with either the acis - s or the high - resolution camera ( hrc - s ) aboard .",
    "the letg provides @xmath1640  @xmath17 effective area at o and o k@xmath18 wavelengths with a modest resolution of @xmath19  km s@xmath20 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we have used the same absorption spectra as in @xcite , which resulted from combining the six long exposures of the existing observations ( table  [ tab : chandra - observation - log ] ) .",
    "._chandra _ observation log . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      @xcite and @xcite performed joint analyses of the absorption and emission spectra in the lmc x3 and pks 2155 - 304 directions and constrained the hot gas temperatures and densities at the plane together with the scale heights .",
    "here we compared our results with those directions ( table  [ tab : results - comparison ] ) .",
    "the scale height @xmath21 in the table represents the scale height for the temperature @xmath22 for lmc x3 and pks 2155304 , and the scale height for the density @xmath23 for mkn 421 , as we changed the parameter @xmath23 of _ vabmkl _ to @xmath22 .",
    "these values indicate a thick hot gas disk surrounding our galaxy , which can be characterized by the exponential model of the column density , scale height and temperature : @xmath24 , a few kpc and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "@xcite combined an averaged column density from the _ chandra _ absorption spectra with an averaged emission measure from literature and suggested that the spatial extent of the hot gas is more than 100  kpc .",
    "moreover , @xcite combined the _",
    "absorption spectra toward mkn 421 with the same _ suzaku _ emission spectra as we used in this paper , and claimed that the spatial extent and the density of the hot gas toward mkn 421 are @xmath26 kpc and @xmath27 , which differ by more than an order of magnitude from our results .",
    "these differences mainly come from the gas distribution model and the oxygen abundance .",
    "they assumed a uniformly distributed isothermal gas with 0.2  @xmath28 , while we assumed the exponentially distributed gas with 1  @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the difference in abundance therefore makes their spatial extent five time larger than our result .",
    "the difference in the distribution model also makes the extent differ .",
    "since the gas temperatures obtained from the absorption line analysis and the emission line analysis are inconsistent , as with previous studies in two other directions , a model with temperature variation along the vertical distance from the galactic plane is more appropriate than an isothermal model . in this paper",
    ", we adopted the exponential model that the temperature and density decrease exponentially with the vertical distance from the galactic plane .",
    "as for the hot gas observable by highly ionized oxygen , our results are consistent with observations of highly ionized absorption lines in spectra of galactic sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicating that most of hot gas contributing to the absorption exists within distance scales of @xmath6  kpc .",

    "we have jointly analyzed x - ray absorption and emission spectral observed by _",

    "our main results and conclusions are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have detected o and o lines in the emission spectra from two _ suzaku _ observations taken in the fields adjacent to the mkn 421 sight line .",
    "the two spectra show significant difference , indicating a patchy thermal emission component to obs2 spectrum . by modeling these emission spectra ( excluding local contributions ) , we obtained a characteristic temperature of the emitting gas as @xmath53 , assumed to be isothermal and in the cie .",
    "this temperature is about 30% higher than that of the absorption gas under the same assumption .",
    "we have jointly analyzed the _ chandra _ absorption and _ suzaku _ emission spectra adopting the exponential thick galactic hot gas disk model , and found that obtained the gas temperature and the density to be @xmath54 and @xmath1 at the galactic plane and have the scale heights of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
