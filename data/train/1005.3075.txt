    "giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) @xcite and tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effects @xcite in spin - valves and magnetic tunnel junctions have been the focus of spintronics studies in the past two decades .",
    "conventional gmr and tmr devices , based on inorganic multilayered structures whose critical element is a sandwich of two magnetic layers separated by nonmagnetic metallic or insulating layers , exhibit a large change in conductance when the orientation of the magnetic layers is changed from parallel ( p ) to antiparallel ( ap ) .",
    "the magnetic layers are usually made of transition metal ferromagnets , which gives a high spin polarization at the fermi energy .",
    "graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) with armchair ( agnr ) or zigzag ( zgnr ) edges @xcite , a novel organic material system produced by cutting graphene along two high - symmetry crystallographic directions , have recently attracted attention in spintronics .",
    "zgnr is predicted to be a semiconductor with spin - polarized electronic states localized on the two edges that are individually ferromagnetically ( fm ) ordered but antiferromagnetically ( afm ) coupled to each other through the graphene backbone @xcite .",

    "a magnetoresistance device based on the transformation from the semiconducting state to the metallic state of the zgnr has been proposed by muoz - rojas _",
    "et al . _ @xcite ; an estimated @xmath1 magnetic field is required to switch the afm to the fm state at room temperature . although these work demonstrate convincingly that spin - polarization and magnetoresistance can be realized using zgnrs , the large magnitude of the electric field required to close the bandgap , the need of local magnetic control or a huge magnetic field , and small spin correlation length due to the lack of magnetic anisotropy in zgnrs@xcite are serious limiting factors for future applications .",
    "moreover , the predicted magnetic states in zgnrs have not been experimentally observed so far .",
    "most of the theoretical studies on gnrs for spintronics applications so far only address ribbons with hydrogen terminations@xcite .",
    "recent experiments have shown that graphitic surface curvature can be used as constraint and guide in which metal clusters aggregate to form linear islands @xcite .",
    "the presence of metal atoms adsorbed on the graphene @xcite or gnr @xcite changes its electronic and magnetic properties and thus is certainly of great interest in physics .    in this paper",
    "we show that hybrid metal - terminated zgnrs ( m - zgnrs ) can be excellent candidate for spintronic applications .",
    "we studied various m - zgnrs with terminations of 3__d _ _ transition metals ( tm ) fe , co , ni and noble metals ( nm ) cu , ag , au using first - principles calculations . compared with hydrogen terminated zgnr ( h - zgnr ) ,",
    "the tm and nm terminations lead to drastically different and unexpected effects in the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of the ribbon .",
    "a very large spin polarization is predicted for m - zgnr with tm terminations in fm state .",
    "we propose a new type of junction with a low , uniform magnetic switching field that utilizes the electronic properties of m - zgnrs , for which a magnetoresistance value as high as 200% can be obtained .",
    "the electronic structure calculations are performed using density functional theory ( dft ) implemented in the pwscf code @xcite .",
    "each m - zgnr is simulated within a supercell geometry containing two pristine zgnr unit - cells with 40 c atoms and 4 metal atoms at two edges .",
    "ultrasoft pseudo - potentials with kinetic energy cutoff of 500 ev are employed in all simulations . for the exchange and correlation functional we used the perdew - burke - ernzerh generalized gradient approximation ( gga )",
    "a vacuum layer of 15  is used between two edges and of 15  between two graphene planes to prevent interaction between adjacent images .",
    "brillouin - zone sampling uses a grid of 12 monkhorst - pack @xcite _ k_-points along the periodic direction of the ribbon .",
    "the optimization of atomic positions proceeds until the force on each atom is less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the transport calculations of the proposed fe - zngr magnetic junction are performed by using the transiesta code @xcite , which is based on nonequilibrium green s function formalism and dft as implemented in the siesta package @xcite . in order to reproduce the correct band structure of the lead ,",
    "it is necessary to use double-@xmath2 basis with polarization for fe atoms , while single-@xmath2 basis with polarization is sufficient for c atoms .",

    "we find that for all cases the metal atoms bond strongly with edge carbon atoms , though the bonding configurations are quite different from one another , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] . for m - zgnrs with co and ni terminations , the relaxed structures are la type . for cu - zgnr",
    "the most favorable structure is lb type , which is 0.98 ev / unit - cell more stable than the la type structure , in good agreement with the result of wu _ et al .",
    "the fe atoms dimerize at the edge of fe - zgnr due to the peierls distortion @xcite .",
    "the most favorable structures for ag - zgnr and au - zgnr are zz type , with a metal - metal distance larger than the length of pristine zgnr unit - cell .",

    "[ tab : table ] .",
    "the large differences between @xmath8 and @xmath11 indicate a large direct binding between the metal and carbon atoms at the ribbon edge .",
    "bader analysis based on the real - space - charge density @xcite for the m - zgnrs shows charge transfer from metal atom to c atom for all cases .",
    "the amounts of charge transfer for au - zgnr and ag - zgnr are 0.08 and 0.19 @xmath12/metal - atom , respectively .",
    "such a difference can be important for nanocatalysis .    for each m - zgnr considered , the ground state has fm spin ordering of the metal atoms at each edge , while afm order between the two edges is favored over fm , similar to h - zgnrs and zgnrs without h - passivation @xcite .",
    "afm coupling of the two edges is energetically more stable due to the indirect rkky exchange interaction as a result of the bipartite lattice @xcite , since the metal terminations always stand at the opposite sublattices at the two edges .",
    "for fe - zgrns , the energy difference @xmath13 between the fm and afm states increases with decreasing ribbon width @xcite due to increased interaction between enhanced spins in inner c sites inside the ribbon . without the ribbon host the two fe chains can only show direct fm exchange coupling through vacuum , and the calculated @xmath13 of the two fe chains becomes less than 0.1 mev /  when the distance is larger than 8  .",
    "nonetheless , as shown in table .",
    "[ tab : table ] , the @xmath13 for all m - zgnrs are less than that of h - zgnr , indicating a relatively small effective magnetic coupling between two edges , especially for tm terminations",
    ".    in general , the total magnetic moment of the system comes mostly from the metal atoms and their nearest - neighbor c atoms at the m - zgnr edges . for tm - zgnrs ,",
    "the edge c atom presents magnetization antiparallel to the nearby tm atom . for co - zgnr and ni - zgnr in particular ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) the magnetic moments of the ribbon become more localized on the metal atoms at the edges compared to the inner c atoms in the ribbon , which leads to a negligibly small exchange energy shown in table . [",
    "tab : table ] . for nm - zgnrs , the metal atom shows magnetization parallel to that of the neighboring c atom at the edge , of order 0.01 @xmath14/metal - atom , mainly due to the proximity effect .",
    "the large difference between magnetic moments in tm and nm terminations reflects their different physical origins . in tm - zgnrs ,",
    "the relatively large moments of tm atoms come from unfilled @xmath15-shells and the tm - c covalent bond reduces the number of unpaired @xmath15-electrons , giving a reduced moment compared to the freestanding tm atom or monoatomic chain . for cu , ag and au terminations with filled @xmath15-shells , the @xmath16 valence electron saturates the dangling @xmath17 bonds similar to the hydrogen terminations in h - zgnrs . the proximity - induced local magnetic moments for cu , ag , au atoms are negligible , but the total edge moments of about 0.3 @xmath14/metal - atom are very close to that of h - zgnr .",
    "although mermin - wagner theorem @xcite excludes long - range order in @xmath18 spin lattice model at finite temperature which would limit the dimension of devices based on h - zgnrs to several nanometers at room temperature @xcite , improvements can be expected in systems of m - zgnrs by increasing the magnetic anisotropy as well as the spin correlation length .",

    "the @xmath19 of the fe - zgnr at @xmath23 is about 82% which is much higher than that of bulk fe @xcite .",
    "this implies that in the ballistic transport regime , the conductance of electrons with one type of spin is larger than the opposite spin .",
    "similar to fe - zgnrs , the fm states of co and ni terminated ribbons also show high spin polarization , 78% and 55% respectively .    however , all studied nm - zgnrs , have a bandgap comparable to that of the hydrogenated ribbon ( 0.32 ev ) in the afm ground - state .",

    "the metastable la type of au - zgnr is metallic for both fm and afm states .",
    "our calculations of truncated fe - zgnrs provide an interesting result : if the transverse armchair edge is terminated by fe , the strong magnetic coupling will align all edge spins in the same direction . such highly spin",
    "polarized fm states can be useful in spintronics ; in particular , a junction consisting of two tm - zgnr leads separated by a spacer can operate as a magnetoresistance device .",
    "[ fig : junction ] ( a ) is a prototype multilayer junction stacking three layers of fe - zgnrs .",
    "the center spacer can be a nonmagnetic metal such as cr or cu , since the behavior of the afm exchange coupling between magnetic layers through a nonmagnetic spacer is well - known @xcite and a gmr junction can thus be made ; one can also use a small piece of non - conducting agnr connected to the two leads via fe chains , as the spacer which will provide a magnetoresistance junction .",
    "the key issue is the ap configuration being the ground state through the spacer : the junction can be switched to the p configuration under a uniform external magnetic field applied to both leads , without the need for a local magnetic field .",
    "a conductance difference between p and ap is in general expected .",
    "our calculations show that the fe - terminated two armchair edges favor either afm or fm configurations depending on the width of the spacer . in fig .",

    "afm coupling of the two armchair edge states of the spacer can lead to an ap ground - state magnetic coupling between the two fe - zgnr leads .",
