    "high - resolution @xmath1-body simulations of hierarchical cosmologies with standard cold - dark - matter show that the spherically averaged density profile of relaxed dark haloes in the present epoch is universal .",
    "it is always well fitted by the analytical function @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the radius , @xmath4 the central asymptotic logarithmic slope , with fixed value equal to 1 according to nfw ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) or closer to 1.5 according to other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and @xmath5 and @xmath0 the scaling density and radius .",
    "thus , halos with a given mass have density profiles characterised by one single parameter .",
    "in fact , the scale radius @xmath0 or the concentration @xmath6 , defined as @xmath7 in terms of the virial radius @xmath8 , are found to tightly correlate with halo mass in all the cosmologies studied by nfw , a relationship that is believed to reflect the fact that less massive haloes typically form earlier , when the mean cosmic density is higher ( nfw ; salvador - sol , solanes & manrique 1998 ) .",
    "@xcite , wechsler et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter wbpkd ) , and zhao et al .",
    "( 2003a , hereafter zmjb ) have both extended these results to other redshifts in the flat @xmath9cdm cosmology ( see also @xcite ; zhao et al .",
    "2003b ; @xcite ) and provided toy - models for the evolution of @xmath0 .    within the hierarchical paradigm of structure formation , mergers appear to contribute decisively to the evolution of haloes .",
    "for this reason , it seems natural to try to explain the origin of the universal halo density profile focusing on the role of mergers ( e.g. , salvador - sol et al .  1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . while a number of investigations @xcite have demonstrated that nfw - like density profiles can be obtained by simple spherical collapse , it is not clear why this functionality should be preserved after major mergers since these events produce an important loss of memory through the rearrangement and violent relaxation of the system . yet , as shown by numerical experiments , haloes end up with very similar density profiles regardless of whether or not they have undergone major mergers @xcite and , provided they have , regardless of the epoch when the last of these events took place ( @xcite ; wbpkd ) .",
    "the situation is even more confusing when one takes into account that the above mentioned mass - concentration relation and other correlations involving @xmath0 ( or @xmath6 ) recently reported by wbpkd and zmjb ( see   [ sim ] ) suggest , on the contrary , that the structure of haloes depends on their individual aggregation history .    in a recent paper , manrique et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter mrsss ) have shown that the sole hypothesis that haloes grow inside - out with the typical accretion rate of the cosmology under consideration automatically leads to a density profile of the nfw - like form as well as to the mass - concentration relation found at @xmath10 by nfw in numerical simulations of that cosmology . moreover , the mass - concentration relation predicted for the @xmath9cdm universe at different redshifts is also in good agreement with the empirical correlations obtained by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( mrsss ; @xcite ) .",
    "mrsss argued that the only reasonable explanation for the good predictions of this pure inside - out accretion scheme is that the typical density profile of relaxed haloes is essentially determined by their current mass and the boundary conditions set by the matter that is currently being accreted . in this manner , _ relaxed haloes emerging from major mergers would have radial profiles indistinguishable from those of haloes with identical global properties and boundary conditions but having endured a more gentle growth_. this would also explain the fact pointed out by @xcite that some aspects of massive elliptical galaxies imply that haloes evolve by preserving their inner structure as in the pure inside - out accretion scheme @xcite while they actually experience important rearrangements in major mergers . however , this possibility is apparently in contradiction with the correlations involving @xmath0 ( or @xmath6 ) found in numerical simulations .    in the present paper",
    "we examine this issue in detail . in   [ sradius ]",
    ", we show that , under some common approximations , @xmath0 depends exclusively on the current values of the halo total mass , energy and the respective instantaneous accretion rates , so there is no room for a dependence on the halo aggregation history . from this result , we develop , in   [ model ] , a simple physical model for the evolution of the scale radius along the main branch of halo merger trees that allows us to show , in   [ sim ] , that there is actually no contradiction between the independence of @xmath0 from the halo aggregation history and the correlations found in numerical simulations suggesting the opposite conclusion .",
    "our results are summarised and discussed in   [ dis ] .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the cosmology used throughout this paper is the same as in wbpkd and zmjb studies , that is , a @xmath9cdm model with @xmath11 .",
    "we will assume hereafter that relaxed haloes are non - rotating and spherically symmetric ( see   [ dis ] for a discussion on the implications of these first - order approximations ) .",
    "taking the potential origin such that @xmath12 , the virial relation adopts the simple scalar form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational constant , @xmath15 the total energy of the halo , @xmath16 the pressure at the virial radius @xmath8 and @xmath17 the mass within @xmath3 , @xmath18    since the virial radius of a halo at a given cosmic time @xmath19 is a function of its total mass through the relation @xmath20^{1/3}\\ , \\label{rad}\\ ] ] resulting from the identification of haloes as connected regions with overdensity @xmath21 relative to the mean cosmic density @xmath22 , it is clear from equation ( [ vir ] ) that @xmath23 depends on the three independent quantities @xmath24 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .      thus , the density profile @xmath23 of relaxed haloes at @xmath19 depends on the four independent quantities : @xmath24 , @xmath15 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , fixing the right hand - side member of equation ( [ vir ] ) .",
    "of course , these are not the only variables on which @xmath23 may depend since the uniqueness of the solution of equation ( [ vir ] ) , regarded as an integral equation for @xmath23 , is not warranted in general ( not even in the case that @xmath23 can be restricted , once @xmath24 is fixed , to a one - parameter function ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 may in principle depend on other quantities , perhaps related to some aspects of the aggregation history of the halo as the correlations mentioned in   [ intro ] suggest . in appendix [ general ] , we show however that for density profiles of the nfw - like universal form the solution of equation ( [ vir ] ) is unique .",
    "consequently , the only parameter required to fix the density profile in this case , @xmath0 , must depend exclusively on @xmath24 , @xmath15 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , _ all relaxed ( spherical , non - rotating ) haloes with identical current values for these four independent quantities necessarily have the same value of @xmath0 regardless of their individual aggregation history_.    a first implication of this result is that it allows one to understand the origin of the mass - concentration relationship shown by haloes at any given epoch without the need to presume any dependence of @xmath0 on the time of their formation . as we have just shown , @xmath0 ( or @xmath6 ) depends , at a given @xmath19 , on @xmath24 , @xmath15 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , while the latter three quantities are expected to correlate , in any given cosmology , with @xmath24 . to see this latter point",
    "we must take into account that the kinetic energy of protohaloes at some early enough , otherwise arbitrary , time @xmath43 arises essentially from the hubble flow at that epoch , whereas their potential energy should not be far from that of a peak of density contrast @xmath44 on the scale @xmath45^{1/3}\\ , , \\label{radi}\\ ] ] with the most probable density profile @xcite . in equation ( [ deltat ] ) , @xmath46 is the linearly extrapolated density contrast for spherical collapse at the present time ( equal to 1.69 in an einstein - de sitter universe ) and @xmath47 the , also cosmology - dependent , linear growth factor .",
    "thus , once the arbitrary time @xmath43 is fixed , equations ( [ deltat ] ) and ( [ radi ] ) can be used to estimate the ( conserved ) total energy @xmath15 of haloes as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath19 . on the other hand , the mass accretion rate @xmath41 of haloes at @xmath19 is well approximated by ( raig , gonzlez - casado , & salvador - sol 2001 )",
    "@xmath48 where @xmath49 is the usual extended press - schechter ( eps ) merger rate @xcite and @xmath50 is the fractional mass increase above which a merger is considered major and , therefore , does not contribute to accretion anymore ( salvador - sol et al .",
    "1998 ) . finally , by introducing the former two functions , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , into the fundamental relationship @xmath53 one can also estimate the energy accretion rate @xmath42 in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath19 .",
    "we want to stress that this interpretation leads to quantitative predictions of the mass - concentration relation from the eps theory that are , except for rare very massive haloes , in good agreement with the results of @xmath1-body simulations for different cosmologies and redshifts ( mrsss ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have just seen that the mass - concentration relation can be explained without presuming any dependence of the density profile of haloes on their mass aggregation history . in   [ sim ] , it will be shown that the same is true with regards the correlations reported by wbpkd and zmjb . but to do this we need first to determine how @xmath0 evolves along the main branch of halo merger trees .    in ",
    "[ sradius ] it was assumed that , during the gentle accretion phase between major mergers , relaxed haloes grow inside - out , i.e. , their inner structure remains frozen .",
    "this implies that haloes evolving along typical accretion tracks , represented by the solution of the differential equation ( raig et al .",
    "2001 ) @xmath55\\ , , \\label{mat}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the mass accretion rate given by equation ( [ ra ] ) , maintain an unaltered value of @xmath0 or , equivalently , that such typical mass accretion tracks coincide with typical @xmath0-isopleths . moreover , according to the result of   [ sradius ] , these @xmath0-isopleths do not depend on the past evolution of haloes but just on their current mass .",
    "thus , haloes undergoing a major merger will jump from the @xmath0-isopleth they were initially following to a new @xmath0-isopleth according only to their change in mass , with the constant value of @xmath0 associated with each accretion track given by the mass - concentration relation at any arbitrary redshift . therefore , the typical value of @xmath0 for a halo evolving along the main branch of a merger tree is simply that corresponding to the typical @xmath0-isopleth ( or mass accretion track ) that is intersected , at each moment , by the mass aggregation track ( mat ) followed by the halo .    at this stage , it is important to remark that the key assumption in this scheme , namely that haloes grow inside - out between major mergers , is fully supported by the results of numerical simulations .",
    "when a halo evolves through accretion and major mergers , @xmath24 necessarily increases but @xmath0 may not do so ; in periods of inside - out growth , @xmath0 will be kept unaltered .",
    "the opposite is not true , of course : the invariance of @xmath0 does not guarantee that the inner structure of the halo remains frozen as the characteristic density @xmath5 may vary . what should certainly be a secure signature for the inside - out growth of haloes along the main branch of merger trees is the simultaneous constancy of both the scale radius @xmath0 and the mass @xmath57 interior to it , as these two quantities fix the two degrees of freedom of the nfw - like density profile . in this case",
    ", the inner structure remains necessarily frozen and the mass @xmath24 grows just because @xmath8 does .",
    "therefore , the inside - out growth of haloes between major mergers must lead to values of @xmath0 and @xmath57 that are kept simultaneously constant along the main branch of halo merger trees between any two sudden increases of @xmath24 marking major mergers .",
    "as figures 2 and 3 of zmjb illustrate , this schematic behaviour is indeed found in numerical simulations ( see also our figs .  [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] below where we depict the results of monte carlo simulations built under the assumption of halo inside - out growth during the accretion phases ) .",
    "it is not inconsistent either with the results obtained by @xcite from numerical simulations of cluster - sized haloes showing that most of the matter that ends up , at @xmath10 , near the centre is not at the centre of their main progenitor at @xmath58 .",
    "the reason is that the inside - out growth only holds between major mergers , while the last major merger where current cluster - sized haloes were rearranged took place at a redshift much smaller than 4 ( typically at @xmath59 ) .    from figures 2 and 3 of zmjb ( and figs .",
    "[ 5 ] and [ 6 ] below ) it is also apparent that the phases of inside - out growth are only found at relatively low redshifts . there is nothing strange in this behaviour .",
    "the inside - out growth of a halo during spherical infall is strictly warranted provided only that the orbital period of particles in any given shell is much smaller than the characteristic time of mass infall ( see mrsss and references therein ) or , equivalently , that accretion is slow enough . in periods of fast accretion ,",
    "shell - crossing is expected rather to induce the violent relaxation of the halo just as major mergers do .",
    "as one goes back in time , the orbital period of particles in the outermost shell becomes of the order of , and even larger than the typical infall time of accreted matter in the cosmology considered , so the conditions for inside - out growth no longer hold .",
    "the redshift @xmath60 at which the transition between fast and slow accretion regimes typically occurs can thus be estimated by comparing the orbital period of particles at the virial radius of the relaxed halo , @xmath61^{-1/2}\\ , , \\label{tau}\\ ] ] with the characteristic time of mass infall during accretion , equal to @xmath62 .",
    "thus , given the equality @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are respectively the hubble and density parameters at @xmath19 , and that , in the relevant range of cosmic times , @xmath65 and @xmath21 can be respectively approximated by 1 and 200 ( for @xmath21 according to @xcite , for which @xmath66 ; @xcite ) , the condition for slow accretion adopts the form @xmath67\\ll 10\\ , h(t)\\,m(t)\\ , .",

    "the typical mat corresponding to each halo mass is drawn from equation ( 18 ) for the appropriate value of @xmath74 according to wbpkd .",

    "that is , to infer them we must solve equation ( [ mat ] ) taking into account only the slow contribution to the accretion rate .",
    "therefore , for @xmath75 where accretion is typically slow , the typical @xmath0-isopleths will coincide with the solutions of equation ( [ mat ] ) based on equation ( [ ra ] ) , while , for @xmath76 where accretion is typically fast and the contribution of slow accretion to the right hand - side member of equation ( [ mat ] ) is null , they will be kept frozen to the values reached at @xmath60 ( see fig . [ 2 ] ) . in this manner ,",
    "our model for the typical evolution of @xmath0 along mats becomes valid _ at all redshifts_. note that , compared to other prescriptions for the evolution of @xmath0 available in the literature , our model stands out for being physically motivated and for eliminating the requirement of knowing ( and , hence , of storing ) the individual aggregation histories of haloes in order to infer the typical value of their @xmath0 at any moment since this is estimated from their current mass only value for relaxed haloes in cdm cosmologies according to our prescription can be downloaded from http://www.am.ub.es/cosmo/gravitation.htm ] .",

    "wbkpd concluded that the density profile of haloes is determined by their aggregation history .",

    "  [ sradius ] , mass and energy conservation , together with the fact that , in any given cosmology , the typical accretion rate of haloes is a function of @xmath24 and @xmath19 , allows one to relate the concentration @xmath6 of haloes at some given redshift to their mass .",

    "as mentioned by these authors , the small deviations of the monte carlo predictions with respect to the @xmath1-body results are likely caused by the well - known inaccuracies of the eps formalism ( and its practical implementation ; see e.g. @xcite and raig et al .",

    "still , zmjb did not offer any explanation neither for the origin of this correlation nor for its dependence on the halo redshift relative to @xmath103 .",
    "in fact , the frequency of major mergers can not be held responsible for the change of slope in the mat of a halo at @xmath103 because , in the @xmath9cdm cosmology , major mergers are , for the present - day halo masses considered by zmjb ( @xmath105 m@xmath73 ) , even more frequent in the slow than in the fast aggregation regimes defined according to the heuristic redshift @xmath103 .",
    "what could explain , instead , the characteristic change of slope in mats observed at that redshift is the transition from fast to slow _ accretion _ at @xmath60 mentioned in   [ model ] . besides , the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath57 predicted by the model developed in that section is expected to split into two tight correlations similar to those found by zmjb when the values of the two quantities are scaled to those of the main progenitor at @xmath60 . note that the @xmath80 relation shown in figure [ 3 ] is very nearly linear in log - log .",
    "therefore , the fact that major mergers and fast accretion tend to increase with decreasing redshift the values of @xmath0 and @xmath57 as haloes evolve along mats plus the slight @xmath82-dependence of the slope of the log - log @xmath80 correlation derived from the zhao et al .",
    "( 2003b ) mass - concentration relations ( see fig .",
    "[ 3 ] ) will translate into a small bending ( on top of the slight intrinsic one ; see appendix b ) of the log - log @xmath80 correlation shown by haloes along mats . consequently , by scaling the values of @xmath0 and @xmath57 to those of the main progenitor at @xmath103 ( or @xmath60 ) along each individual mat , such a bent correlation will split into two essentially linear relations on both sides of that redshift , with that corresponding to the fast regime being slightly steeper as found by zmjb .",
    "note however that , according to our model , since the values of @xmath0 and @xmath57 do not depend on the particular mat the haloes have followed , the scaled @xmath80 correlations reported by zmjb should not rely on their scaling by the specific values of @xmath0 and @xmath57 corresponding to the main progenitor found at @xmath103 ( or @xmath60 ) along each _ particular _ mat . using as reference the object found at @xmath103 ( or @xmath60 ) along the _ typical _ mat for haloes with the mass of that being studied should yield essentially the same results",

    "unfortunately , this is not so immediate in the present case . as explained in   [ model ] , our model for the evolution of @xmath0 ( and @xmath57 ) is not fully consistent with the mass - concentration relations found by zhao et al . at high redshifts",

    "but , as shown in the appendix [ correlation ] , this general correlation still has some intrinsic , less marked , convexity , which will also make it split , when properly scaled , into two linear correlations similar to those found by zmjb , with the reference halo in the individual or typical mats playing exactly the same role .        -.7 cm",
    "-.7 cm    with this aim , we performed monte carlo mats as explained in   [ ca ] but now following also the evolution of @xmath57 . in figures [ 5 ] and [ 6 ]",
    "we show a few of these realisations for final halo masses similar to those appearing in figures 2 and 3 of zmjb . to better mimic the zmjb results ,",
    "the mass increases produced along the mats were accumulated between each couple of consecutive output times chosen identical to those in the zmjb @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "the @xmath103 values , marked on these tracks by arrows , were obtained following the prescription given by zmjb , whereas the @xmath60 values , marked by big dots , were calculated using the same criterion as in figure [ 1 ] . despite the fact that our @xmath0 and @xmath57 tracks do not include the effects of the random deviations of @xmath15 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 from their respective typical values , they show a remarkable similarity to those depicted in figures 2 and 3 of zmjb .",
    "there is good agreement not only in the general shape of the mats and the associated @xmath0 and @xmath57 tracks ( see , in particular , the effects of inside - out growth during slow accretion ) , but also in the typical location of the @xmath103 values . from these figures",
    "we can see that every @xmath103 is close to the corresponding @xmath60 marking the change of accretion regime along each mat , which confirms our guess on the origin of the change in slope of mats .",
    "it is interesting to note that the procedure followed to determine @xmath103 tends to locate this characteristic redshift just after a major merger or an interval of fast accretion .",
    "this introduces a systematic discontinuity in the slope of the mats at that redshift that explains the two - branch analytical fitting formula proposed by zhao et al .",
    "( 2003b ) for the average mat of haloes .",
    "however , when @xmath103 is not privileged as in wbpkd , the typical mat of haloes of mass @xmath24 shows no such discontinuity .",
    "-.5 cm    in figure [ 7 ] , we plot the scaled @xmath80 correlations corresponding to the fast and slow accretion regimes , as in figure 7 of zmjb , drawn from objects along the monte carlo mats of figures [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] at the same redshifts as in the zmjb figure . to mimic the effects of the random deviations of @xmath15 , @xmath41 and @xmath106 in @xmath1-body haloes",
    ", we have added once again gaussian deviates in log(@xmath107 with a dispersion equal to @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the slow and fast accretion regimes , respectively .",
    "( unlike wbpkd , who impose no restriction on their halo sample , zmjb chose relatively isolated final haloes .",
    "hence , the dispersion in @xmath6 of these haloes is expected to be slightly smaller at @xmath110 than in the case of wbpkd . on the contrary",
    ", the fact that haloes should be typically less relaxed at @xmath111 should cause a higher dispersion in @xmath6 there . ) in the top panels , we show the results obtained when the scaling reference is the halo located at @xmath60 along the _ typical _ mat for the mass of each object , while in the bottom panels we show those obtained by using , instead , the halo at @xmath103 along each _ individual _ mat just like in zmjb . as expected , both variants show identical trends : tight linear correlations in log - log with similar slopes and scatters , strongly resembling those in the original zmjb scaled correlations . specifically , the slopes in the fast and slow accretion regimes are @xmath112 and @xmath113 , for the typical - mat variant , and @xmath114 and @xmath115 , for the particular - mat one .",
    "since in the former case , the correlations obtained do not involve , by construction , the mat of individual haloes , we conclude that the change in slope of these scaled correlations at @xmath103 ( or @xmath60 ) does not imply the dependence of @xmath0 ( and @xmath57 ) on the individual halo aggregation history .",
    "the same conclusion should therefore hold for the correlations obtained by zmjb ( with slopes in the fast and slow regimes respectively equal to 0.64 and 0.48 ) .",
    "in the present paper , we have shown that the scale radius @xmath0 of relaxed , non - rotating , spherically symmetric haloes endowed with the universal density profile  la nfw depends exclusively on the current values of their mass and energy and the instantaneous accretion rates of these two quantities .",
    "there is therefore no room for any additional dependence on the particulars of their aggregation histories . using a simple , physically motivated model for the evolution of @xmath0 along the main branch of halo merger trees",
    ", we have demonstrated that our finding that @xmath0 does not depend on the halo past evolution is fully compatible with the well - known mass - concentration relation and the correlations recently reported by wbpkd and zmjb suggesting the opposite conclusion .",
    "we note however that the correlation found by zmjb has an origin slightly different from that predicted within our scheme since it appears to be related to the particular @xmath82-dependence of the mass - concentration relation found by these authors compared to that obtained by other groups .",
    "the present results support the explanation recently provided by mrsss for the origin of the universal halo density profile .",
    "apart from the correlations here investigated , @xmath1-body simulations show that the density of the local environment also correlates with the frequency of major mergers occurring along the halo aggregation histories ( the higher the density , the higher this frequency ; @xcite ) and with the value of @xmath0 ( the higher the density , the smaller @xmath0 ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , some correlation may exist between @xmath0 and the frequency of major mergers along the main branch of individual halo merger trees .",
    "as is well - known , in its original form the eps formalism does not contain information on the spatial distribution of haloes , so it is not possible to infer from our model ( unless modified along the lines proposed by @xcite or @xcite ) any correlation between @xmath0 and local density from our model . however , given that the environment of a halo should affect its instantaneous accretion rate ( the higher the density , the larger the typical accretion rate ) and that , as we have demonstrated , the value of @xmath0 depends on this latter quantity , a correlation between @xmath0 and local density is also expected to hold within our scheme .",
    "for the same reason , the fact that haloes located in high ( low ) density environments may have had a higher ( lower ) chance of merging with other haloes along their past history is not inconsistent with the present results either .",
    "what these results do not support is the existence of a _ direct causal relation _ between the frequency of major mergers endured by a halo during its growth and the final value of its scale radius .",
    "the conclusions of the present study rely on some hypotheses that deserve some discussion .",
    "the least controversial of these is that of the inside - out growth of haloes between major mergers ; as shown in   [ model ] , it is fully supported by the results of numerical simulations .",
    "in contrast , the assumption that haloes are spherically symmetric and non - rotating is actually not very realistic . had we not adopted these simplifying approximations , the angular momentum , the asphericity of the system ( via the inertia tensor ) and the anisotropy of the local velocity tensor would appear in the full vectorial form of the virial relation , invalidating the proof in appendix [ general ] .",
    "we thus can not discard the possibility that , under more realistic assumptions , the inner structure of haloes can preserve some memory of their aggregation history .",
    "we are not concerned here , of course , about the memory embodied in the final value of any extensive property , such as the total mass , energy or angular momentum , that are integrated , and hence fully convolved , over the entire evolutionary history of the system .",
    "the kind of memory that is relevant for the present discussion is rather that associated with the possible imprint on the inner structure of haloes of _ specific events _ , such as the formation of the halo ( whatever its definition ) , the transition from fast to slow aggregation regimes or the frequency of major mergers , having taken place at some point in the past .",
    "certainly , the elongation and the anisotropy of the velocity tensor of haloes indicate that the episodes of violent relaxation do not proceed until completion .",
    "but this does not necessarily mean , of course , that the loss of memory produced in those relaxation processes is so small that precise information on those specific events can be recovered from the final properties of the spherically averaged density profile .",
    "the results obtained in the present paper rather suggest , along the lines of those drawn from @xmath1-body experiments mentioned in   [ intro ] ( @xcite ; wbpkd ) , that the density profile of haloes is largely insensitive to the details of their aggregation history . in any case , they show that , from the correlations found in numerical simulations , it can not be concluded that @xmath0 depends on the halo aggregation history since , at least under the assumption of spherical symmetry and null - rotation , they are well explained and quantitatively recovered without presuming such a dependence .",
