    "many extensions of the standard model predict the existence of axion - like particles ( alps ) , namely very light spin - zero bosons @xmath5 characterized by a two - photon vertex @xmath6  @xcite . in the presence of an external electromagnetic field , this coupling gives rise to photon - alp mixing , which leads in turn to two distinct phenomena .",
    "one is _ photon - alp oscillations _",
    "@xcite , which is exploited by the admx experiment  @xcite to search for alp dark matter  @xcite , by cast to search for solar alps  @xcite and by the regeneration laser experiments  @xcite .",
    "the other phenomenon consists in the _ change of the polarization state _ of a photon beam traveling in a magnetic field .",
    "more specifically , an initially linearly polarized beam propagating in a magnetic field undergoes two different effects : _ ( a ) _ it acquires an elliptical polarization , and _ ( b ) _ the ellipse s major axis gets rotated with respect to the initial polarization direction .",
    "the former effect is called _ birefringence _ while the latter _ dichroism _  @xcite .",
    "a claim for a positive observational evidence of both vacuum birefringence and vacuum dichroism by the pvlas collaboration  @xcite employing a laser beam has subsequently been withdrawn  @xcite .    over the last few years",
    "it has been realized that the @xmath7 coupling can also produce detectable effects in the observations of distant active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , since photons emitted by these sources can mix with alps during their propagation through large - scale magnetic fields ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) . in this context ,",
    "photon - alp oscillations  @xcite provide a natural mechanism to drastically reduce photon absorption caused by extragalactic background light above roughly @xmath8 where observations of agn are currently performed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes  @xcite .",
    "astrophysical observations of agn and grbs also offer the opportunity to look for alp effects in polarization measurements .",
    "constraints on alps from future grb polarimetric measurements have been recently discussed  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive a new bound on the photon - alp coupling using ultraviolet ( uv ) data from agn in radio galaxies ( rgs ) by searching for a rotation of the detected photon linear polarization with respect to the emitted one .",
    "our analysis has been inspired by recent studies  @xcite , where the same data - set has been used to constrain the effects of a possible cosmological dichroism , occurring when photons coupled to an hypothetical background of cosmic nambu - goldstone fields propagate over long distances .",
    "however , our investigation is quite different in spirit . for , we do not absolutely assume the presence of a background of alps but merely the existence of a large - scale magnetic field * b*.    now , in spite of the fact that agn in rgs are very complicated objects , the scattering model of anisotropic nuclear uv radiation predicts that the angle between the uv axis of the source and the uv linear polarization is @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "cosmic dichroism or photon - alp mixing can  by rotating the linear uv polarization  give rise to an angle different from @xmath9 between the observed linear polarization of the uv radiation and the uv axis of a single source .",
    "given that no rotation has been detected so far within a few degrees for each analyzed source , we are able to set a bound on the product of the photon - alp coupling times the strength of the large - scale magnetic field ",
    "namely on @xmath10  since any observable effect involving alps in an external magnetic field depends on the product @xmath10 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .  2 we review the formalism describing the photon - alp mixing and its implications for photon oscillations and polarization .",
    "3 we introduce our input parameters , the agn in rgs data - set and we describe the constraints coming from the absence of rotation of the linear polarization of the uv radiation emitted by the considered sources . finally , in sec .  4",
    "we compare our new bound with the the ones present in the literature , and we discuss possible improvements .",
    "photon - alp mixing occurs in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath11 due to the interaction term  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the photon - alp coupling constant ( which has the dimension of an inverse energy ) .",
    "we consider throughout a monochromatic and linearly polarized photon beam of energy @xmath14 propagating along the @xmath15 direction in a cold ionized and magnetized medium .",
    "it has been shown that for very relativistic alps , the beam propagation equations takes the form  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the photon linear polarization amplitudes along the @xmath19 and @xmath20 axis , respectively , @xmath21 denotes the alp amplitude and @xmath22 represents the photon - alp mixing matrix .",
    "actually , @xmath22 takes a simpler form if we restrict our attention to the case in which @xmath11 is homogeneous .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the transverse magnetic field , namely its component in the plane normal to the beam direction .",
    "we can choose the @xmath20 axis along @xmath23 so that @xmath24 vanishes . the linear photon polarization state parallel to the transverse field direction @xmath23",
    "is then denoted by @xmath25 and the orthogonal one by @xmath26 . in this case",
    "the mixing matrix can be written as  @xcite @xmath27 whose elements are  @xcite @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the term @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the plasma frequency expressed as a function of the electron density in the medium @xmath34 .",
    "the terms @xmath35 describe the cotton - mouton effect , i.e.  the birefringence of fluids in the presence of a transverse magnetic field where @xmath36 .",
    "the latter terms are of little importance for the following analysis and will thus be neglected . the faraday rotation term @xmath37 , which depends on the energy and the longitudinal component @xmath38 , couples the modes @xmath25 and @xmath26  @xcite . while faraday rotation is in principle important when analyzing polarized photon sources , it actually plays no role at the energies we are dealing with .    in this simplified geometry , the component @xmath26 decouples away , and the propagation equation reduce to a 2-dimensional problem .",
    "its solution follows from the diagonalization of the 2-dimensional mixing sub - matrix of @xmath39 through a similarity transformation performed with an orthogonal matrix , parametrized by the rotation angle @xmath40 which takes the value  @xcite @xmath41 in particular , the probability for a photon emitted in the state @xmath25 to oscillate into an alp after traveling a distance @xmath42 is given by  @xcite @xmath43 where the oscillation wave number is @xmath44^{1/2 } \\,\\ .\\ ] ] it proves useful to define a critical energy  @xcite @xmath45 in terms of which the oscillation wave number can be rewritten as @xmath46 from eqs .",
    "( [ theta])-([a17 t ] ) it follows that in the energy range @xmath47 the photon - alp mixing is maximal ( @xmath48 ) and the conversion probability becomes energy - independent .",
    "this is the so - called _ strong - mixing regime_. outside this regime the conversion probability turns out to be energy - dependent and vanishingly small , so that @xmath49 acquires the meaning of a low - energy cut - off .",
    "as already pointed out , it is now evident that all results depend on the product @xmath50 , and not on @xmath1 and @xmath0 separately .",
    "let us now focus our attention on the polarization effects , keeping in mind that for our monochromatic beam the electric field components are @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath53 and @xmath54 the beam photons described by @xmath25 and @xmath55 , respectively , and by @xmath56 a `` magnetic field photon '' . since the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ mr ] ) has the form @xmath57 , it follows that the photons @xmath53 mix with the alps @xmath5 whereas the photons @xmath54 do not mix at all .    assuming the considered beam to be initially ( @xmath58 ) linearly polarized at an angle @xmath59 ( with respect to an arbitrarily chosen fixed direction ) , we address first the effect arising from the production of _ real _ alps , occurring via the @xmath6 vertex with one photon line representing a @xmath56 photon .",
    "since only @xmath60 mixes with @xmath5 , the @xmath61 mode gets depleted thereby decreasing @xmath25 whereas @xmath26 is manifestly unchanged . as a consequence , we have a _ rotation _ of @xmath62 as the beam propagates , and since it occurs because of the selective loss of photons depending on their polarization the effect in question is called _ dichroism _ , owing to the analogous situation occurring in classical optics .",
    "clearly after a distance @xmath15 the rotation angle is @xmath63 consider next what happens for the exchange of _ virtual _ alps , namely for the diagram in which two @xmath64 vertices are joined together by the @xmath5 line and two external photon lines are actually @xmath56 photons .",
    "evidently this diagram is nonvanishing for incoming @xmath53 photons while it vanishes for incoming @xmath54 ones .",
    "consequently , the index of refraction in the two modes @xmath61 and @xmath65 is different , which means that the two modes @xmath53 and @xmath54 travel at different speeds .",
    "therefore , at any finite distance from the source , the beam polarization turns out to be _",
    "elliptical_. even more explicitly , as the photon beam propagates its @xmath62-vector changes both direction and magnitude so as to trace a spiral around the @xmath15 direction with elliptical sections . after each @xmath66 rotation ,",
    "a different projected ellipse gets singled out in the plane perpendicular to the beam .",
    "this effect is called _ birefringence _ due to the similar situation taking place when a linearly polarized photon beam traverses an anisotropic medium .",
    "still  as long as birefringence alone is concerned  all such ellipses have _ parallel _ major axes , which is just an elementary manifestation of the composition of two harmonic motions along orthogonal directions .",
    "so , when both dichroism and birefringence are at work an initially linearly polarized photon beam acquires an elliptical polarization with the ellipse s major axis rotated with respect to the initial polarization .",
    "we remark that a qualitatively similar situation occurs _ in vacuum _ according to quantum electrodynamics , where birefringence arises from delbrck scattering ( photon scattering in a magnetic field )  @xcite while dichroism is produced by photon splitting  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "elsewhere the birefringence in the emission of grbs has been analyzed  @xcite , whereas here our interest is focussed on dichroism . in spite of the difference in the physical effects ,",
    "both studies are based on the propagation of photons from distant sources through large - scale magnetic fields . according to the standard lore",
    ", they are modeled as a network of magnetic domains , with size equal to the coherence length . in every domain the magnetic field @xmath11",
    "is assumed to have the same strength but its direction is allowed to change randomly from one domain to another .",
    "therefore the propagation over many magnetic domains is a truly 3-dimensional problem , because  due to the randomness of the direction of @xmath11  the mixing matrix @xmath22 entering the beam propagation equation can not be reduced to a block - diagonal form similar to @xmath39 in all domains .",
    "rather , we take the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath15 coordinate system as fixed once and for all , and  denoting by @xmath67 the angle between @xmath68 and the @xmath20 axis in the @xmath69-th domain",
    " we treat every @xmath67 as a random variable in the range @xmath70 . the numerical technique adopted to solve",
    "the beam propagation equation in the present case closely follows the one used in  @xcite , to which the reader is addressed for more details .",
    "we stress that because of the random orientation of the magnetic field in each domain , the effect of photon - alp mixing on the photon polarization strongly depends on the orientation of the line of sight . as a consequence of the stochastic nature of this process",
    ", the photon polarization will be characterized by a probability distribution function , obtained by considering photon - alp conversions over different realizations of the large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "as a preliminary step , it is convenient to express the relevant physical quantities in units set by their natural values . the energy of uv photons is @xmath71  ev . the strength of the large - scale magnetic field in the intergalactic medium has to meet the constraint @xmath72  where @xmath73 denotes its coherence length  which arises by scaling the original bound from the faraday effect of distant radio sources  @xcite to the now much better known baryon density measured by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) mission  @xcite .",
    "its coherence length is expected to lie in the range @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "the mean diffuse intergalactic plasma density is bounded by @xmath75  @xmath76 , arising from the wmap measurement of the baryon density  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a plasma frequency @xmath77  ev today .",
    "however , at the moment no measurements of @xmath34 are available in the large voids of the interstellar medium .",
    "since the average value of @xmath34 inferred by wmap has been sometimes criticized  @xcite claiming it to be too large for most of the intergalactic space , we allow it to vary within a range of two orders of magnitude below this value . accordingly the upper bound on @xmath78 gets reduced by one order of magnitude .",
    "recent results from the cast experiment yield a direct bound on the photon - alp coupling constant @xmath79  gev@xmath3 for @xmath80  ev  @xcite , slightly better than the long - standing globular - cluster limit  @xcite .",
    "in addition , for @xmath81  ev a more stringent limit arises from the absence of @xmath82-rays from sn  1987a , giving @xmath83  gev@xmath3  @xcite even if with a large uncertainty . therefore , a suitable parametrization of the relevant quantities is @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 moreover , the value of the critical energy in eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) is given by @xmath87    as we are interested in studying the propagation of photons from agn at redshifts @xmath88 we must also take into account the redshift evolution of the environment that causes the photon - alp mixing .",
    "notably the observed energy @xmath89 is red - shifted with respect to emitted one @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath90 . assuming that the large - scale magnetic field is frozen in the plasma  @xcite , its strength scales as @xmath91 and clearly we have @xmath92 .",
    "here , the subscript 0 indicates values at the present epoch .",
    "the physical size of a magnetic domain scales as @xmath93 provided that it is smaller than the hubble radius .      in order to quantify the amount of rotation of the linear polarization which takes place during the propagation ,",
    "it is important to deal with photon sources for which the initial photon linear polarization can be reliably determined . optical / uv radiation from agn in rgs at redshift @xmath94 is very well suited in this respect .",
    "these astronomical objects are well known emitters of linearly polarized radiation in the radio band as well as in the optical / uv bands . while the dichroism analysis of radio photons suffers from strong uncertainties , coming both from the absence of a reliable prediction for the polarization characteristics and from faraday rotation , the analysis of optical / uv radiation is more robust .",
    "in particular , the orientation of the polarization of optical / uv radiation can be predicted from physical arguments  @xcite and it is expected to be _ perpendicular _ to the optical / uv source axis .",
    "actually , astronomers define a fiducial fixed direction on the plane of the sky and define the _ source position angle _ as that formed by the optical / uv source axis with such a fiducial direction . since photon polarization is transverse , the observed ones have polarization direction in the plane of the sky , and so one can define the _ polarization position angle _ as the one formed by the polarization and the above fiducial direction .",
    "so , we can rephrase the above expectation by stating that the difference @xmath95p.a . between the source and the polarization position angles",
    "is expected to be @xmath9 .",
    "we consider here and show in table  [ tab : sources ] the set of sources already used in  @xcite to constrain the cosmological dichroism .",
    "the second column indicates the redshift @xmath15 of each source .",
    "the third column reports @xmath95p.a . , which has been measured on the available images",
    "these sources were selected in order to provide robust upper limits on the rotation of the polarization angle in the uv band ( 1300 @xmath96 in the source rest - frame )  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the fact that @xmath95p.a . is close to @xmath97 for every object  actually compatible with @xmath97 within the accuracy of the measurements  puts stringent constraints on the rotation of the linear polarization of the uv radiation during the propagation .",

    "we remark that the number of the considered sources at @xmath150 is close to 200 @xcite of which 10 objects have been observed with spectro - polarimeters and 8 have been found to be polarized .",
    "therefore , it is not unrealistic to expect an improvement in the statistics of the uv polarized sources in question in the near future .    in conclusion",
    ", our work suggests once more the interesting physics potential of astrophysical observations as a means to constrain alps . from the above discussion",
    "it follows that all the current bounds on ultralight alps nicely merge . nevertheless , since every experimental measure and every cosmological and astrophysical constraint has its own systematic uncertainties and its own recognized or un - recognized loopholes , it is important to use many different approaches in order to constrain these elusive particles .",
