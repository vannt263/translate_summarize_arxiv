    "on one hand recent cosmological observations , and particuarly the hubble diagram for type ia supernovae @xcite have led to the idea that the universe may be dominated by a component with negative pressure @xcite and thus that today the universe is accelerating .",
    "such a component can also , if one sticks to the prediction of inflation that @xmath3 , account for the `` missing energy '' . yet , many candidates have been proposed like a cosmological constant , a `` dynamical '' cosmological constant @xcite , cosmic strings @xcite or a spatially homogeneous scalar field rolling down a potential @xcite .    on the other hand , potentials decreasing to zero for infinite value of the field have been shown to appear in particle physics models ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for instance , exponential potentials arise in high order gravity @xcite , in kaluza - klein theories which are compactified to produce the four dimensional observed universe @xcite or can arise due to non - perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation @xcite . inverse power law potentials can be obtained in models where supersymmetry is broken through fermion condensates @xcite .",
    "this gives one more theoretical motivation to study the cosmological implications of a field with such potentials .",
    "the cosmological solutions with such a field have first been studied by ratra and peebles @xcite ( see also @xcite ) who showed the existence and stability of scaling solutions in respectively a field , radiation or matter dominated dominated universe for a field evolving in an exponential and inverse power law potential . a complete study in the framework of barotropic cosmologies in the case of the exponential potential @xcite",
    "show that the solutions were stable to shear perturbations and to curvature perturbations when @xmath4 , but that for realistic matter ( such as dust ) these solutions were unstable , essentialy to curvature perturbations .",
    "liddle and scherrer @xcite made a complete classification of the field potentials and show that power law potentials also lead to scaling solutions ( i.e. to solutions such that the field energy density @xmath5 , behaves as the scale factor at a given power ) and the coupling of the field to ordinary matter has been considered in @xcite .",
    "such solutions are indeed of interest in cosmology since they provide a candidate for a component with negative pressure .",
    "cosmological models with a scalar field have started to be investigated @xcite for different kind of potentials as cosine potential @xcite , exponential potential @xcite and inverse power law potentials @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the luminosity distance as a function of redshift @xcite or the behaviour of density perturbations in the dust era as a function of redshift @xcite can be used to reconstruct the field potential .",
    "however , all these studies have been done under the hypothesis that the field is minimally coupled to the metric .",
    "it is known that terms with such a non - minimal coupling @xmath6 between the scalar curvature @xmath7 and the field @xmath8 can appear when quantizing fields in curved spacetime @xcite , in multi - dimensional theories @xcite like superstring and induced gravity theories @xcite .",
    "since these theories predict both the existence of scalar fields with potential or power - law potential and non - minimal coupling , it is of interest to study the influence of this coupling , and for instance the robustness of the existence and stability of scaling solutions .",
    "the influence of such a coupling during an inflationary period and the existence of inflationnary attractors have yet been examined ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this article , we study the stability of scaling solutions of a non - minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "we first present (  [ ii ] ) the main notations and equations . after having , in ",
    "[ iii ] , briefly recalled the standard approach for determining the potentials that can give rise to such behaviour for a minimally coupled scalar field , we investigate the inverse power law potentials (  [ iv ] ) and the exponential potential (  v ) . in the latter case ,",
    "we study the two limiting situations @xmath1 and @xmath9 and then have a heuristic discussion in the general case .",
    "we assume that the universe is described by a friedmann - lematre model with euclidean spatial sections so that the line element reads @xmath10 \\equiv { \\bar g}_{\\mu\\nu}dx^\\mu dx^\\nu,\\label{metrique_bgd}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the scale factor and @xmath12 the cosmic time .",
    "greek indices are running from 0 to 3 and latin indices from 1 to 3 .",
    "the hubble parameter h is defined as @xmath13 , where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "we also introduce @xmath14 the covariant derivative associated to @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the matter content of this universe is composed of a perfect fluid and a homogeneous scalar field @xmath8 coupled to gravity and coupled to matter only through gravity .",
    "the fluid energy density , @xmath16 , and pressure , @xmath17 , are related through the equation of state @xmath18 where @xmath19 refers to `` background '' .",
    "the conservation of the energy - momentum of the fluid reduces to @xmath20    the scalar field @xmath8 evolves in a potential @xmath21 and its dynamics is given by the lagragian @xmath22\\sqrt{-\\bar g}d^4x , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the field - metric coupling constant ( @xmath23 corresponds to a minimally coupled field and @xmath24 to a conformally coupled field ) , @xmath7 is the scalar curvature of the spacetime .",
    "no known fundamental principle predicts the functional form @xmath25 and we will assume that @xmath26 .",
    "this is however the only choice that allows for a dimensionless @xmath0 .",
    "the equation of evolution is then obtained by varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the field which leads to the klein - gordon equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 . for an homogeneous field in the spacetime ( [ metrique_bgd ] )",
    ", it reduces to @xmath29 the energy density and the pressure of this field are defined by @xmath30 and we define @xmath31 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath32 is obtained by varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath33 and reads @xmath34 @xmath35 being the einstein tensor of the background metric .",
    "this expression can be compared to standard results ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note however that when the signature of the metric is @xmath36 , one has to change the sign of @xmath33 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 while @xmath32 and @xmath40 remain unaffected .",
    "it is then straigthforward to check that the density and the pressure ( [ defprho ] ) of the scalar field are given by @xmath41 and that the conservation of the energy - momentum of the field ( @xmath42 ) reduces to the klein - gordon equation ( [ klein_gordon ] ) @xmath43 [ we have used that the scalar curvature and the einstein tensor are respectively given by @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the equation of state of the field is defined by @xmath47    the matter content being described , we can write the einstein equations which dictate the dynamics of the spacetime and , in our case , reduces to the friedmann equations @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "one equation of the set ( [ cons_fluide],[phiflu ] , [ friedmann],[friedmann2 ] ) is redundant due to the bianchi identities .",
    "it will also be usefull to introduce the density parameter of a component @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "they must satisfy ( from equation [ friedmann ] ) the constraint @xmath52",
    "in this section , we briefly recall the `` standard '' procedure to show that there exist scaling solutions and to determine the potentials that give rise to such solutions .",
    "this presentation will also enable us to understand the differences with the more general case of non - minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "we follow the approach initiated by ratra and peebles @xcite and others @xcite where one , assuming a scaling form for @xmath5 , derives an equation for @xmath53 and then uses ( [ rhophi]-[pphi ] ) to deduce the associated potential .    the equation ( [ cons_fluide ] ) of evolution of the background fluid density can be integrated to give @xmath54 where a subscript 0 refers to quantities evaluated at a given initial time .",
    "we now look for scaling solutions , i.e. solutions such that @xmath55 since @xmath56 $ ] , we deduce that @xmath57 $ ] ( let us emphasize that this is a priori no longer true when @xmath58 ) . using equations ( [ rhophi]-[pphi ] ) , such a solution must satisfy @xmath59 now , the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) implies that the field should satisfy @xmath60 this can be integrated for different relative values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .      in that situation , ( [ dphidx ] )",
    "leads to @xmath64 and then using ( [ phistate ] ) , to the potential @xmath65    this solution corresponds to the scalar field dominated universe of ratra and peebles @xcite and to their scaling solution in the case @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( i.e. radiation or matter dominated universe ) .",
    "note that with such a potential , @xmath5 will , by construction , mimic the evolution of the background fluid and that we do not have to assume that @xmath68 .",
    "note however that , if the scalar field has reached the attractor from very early time , @xmath5 behaves like radiation and thus contributes to a non - negligible part of the radiation content during the nucleosynthesis and it has been shown that it implies the constraint @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "moreover , since @xmath70 in the matter era , such a field will not explain the supernovae measurements ( which seem to favor @xmath71 @xcite ) even if it can account for a substantial part of the dark matter .      in this case",
    "we have @xmath73 which can be integrated ( @xmath74 ) to give @xcite @xmath75}.\\label{xpot}\\ ] ] again , using ( [ phistate ] ) , we can deduce the potential @xmath76 @xmath77 being given by ( [ xpot ] ) . indeed , we only get the potential in a parametric form , but when @xmath78 ( i.e. when the perfect fluid drives the evolution of the universe , @xmath77 can be eliminated from ( [ xpot]-[xpot2 ] ) to give @xmath79 when @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we recover the ratra - peebles result @xcite as well as the liddle - scherrer result @xcite for all @xmath61 .",
    "this parametric general form of the potential seems however not to have been exhibited before .",
    "the former procedure can not be applied when the field is non - minimally coupled since it is impossible for instance to write a closed equation for @xmath80 as in ( [ dphidx ] ) . moreover , we are interested in a field evolving in a given potential .",
    "we assume that the field evolves in an inverse power law potential and show that there exist scaling solutions , the stability of which is then studied .",
    "we assume that the potential takes the form @xmath81 with @xmath82 being the planck mass .",
    "the universe is dominated by the perfect fluid so that ( we assume @xmath83 ) @xmath84 redefining @xmath85 as @xmath12 and @xmath86 as @xmath8 , the klein - gordon equation ( [ klein_gordon ] ) becomes @xmath87 looking for a solution of this equations of the form @xmath88 , one obtains @xmath89 so that @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "this solution is only well - defined if @xmath92    one can then compute the energy and the pressure of this field by inserting this solution into ( [ rhophi]-[pphi ] ) and verify , after some algebra , that @xmath93 whatever the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this shows that the scaling solution does not depend on the coupling in the sense that @xmath94 is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this relation generalises the one found for minimally - coupled scalar fields @xcite .      as emphasized in the previous section",
    ", the scaling solution does not depend on the coupling @xmath0 .",
    "the stability of such a solution is known when @xmath23 @xcite , we now have to study it when @xmath58 .",
    "following @xcite , we define the new set of variables @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the scaling solution ( [ scaling_plaw ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath97 .",
    "using @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , equation ( [ kg_law ] ) reduces to @xmath101 + \\frac{12}{m}\\left[\\frac{4}{m}-1\\right]\\xi\\right)\\left(u - u^{-(\\alpha+1)}\\right)=0 . \\label{eq_lambda}\\ ] ] the scaling solution corresponds to the critical point @xmath102 . introducing @xmath103 and linearising around this critical point [ @xmath104",

    "thus ,    * when the two eigenvalues are complex , @xmath112 and their real part is given by , @xmath113 and the scaling solution is stable if @xmath114 * when the two eigenvalues @xmath106 are real , their product is ( from [ eq_lambda ] ) @xmath115 + \\frac{6(\\alpha+2)}{m}\\left[\\frac{4}{m}-1\\right]\\xi\\right)>0,\\ ] ] because of the condition ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "they are thus of the same sign , their sum being @xmath116 they will both be negative if @xmath117 and thus , the solution will be stable only if @xmath118 as in the case @xmath119 .    in conclusion , we find that _ whatever _ the coupling constant @xmath0 , the scaling solution ( [ scaling_plaw ] ) will be stable if and only if @xmath114 the value of @xmath0 only determines the nature of the stable point , i.e. wether it is a stable spiral or a stable node .",
    "this generalises the study by liddle - scherrer @xcite to a non - minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "we now focuse on potentials of the form @xmath120 and work under the same assumptions as in  [ iv ] . redefining @xmath12 and @xmath8 as in  [ iv ]",
    ", the klein - gordon equation now reads @xmath121 when the coeficient of @xmath8 vanishes , i.e. in a radiation dominated universe ( @xmath67 ) or when @xmath23 , one can find a special solution of the form @xmath122 .",
    "we get that ( see  [ exp ] with @xmath123 ) @xmath124 where the subscript @xmath125 refers to the scaling solution . in radiation era , this implies for instance that @xmath126 and the scalar field behaves like radiation .",
    "indeed , this is a very special case since in that period @xmath127 and the field does not `` feel '' the non - minimal coupling and it evolves as if it were minimally coupled .",
    "the complete study of these solution in function of the two parameters ( @xmath128 ) @xcite shows that when @xmath129 , the scaling solution @xmath96 is a stable node or spiral whereas , when @xmath130 , the late time attractor is the field dominated solution , which we do not consider here .",
    "the convergence towards the solution @xmath96 is illustrated on figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "now , in the most general case where @xmath131 , it is easy to realize that a solution of the form @xmath122 can not be solution of equation ( [ kg_exp ] ) .",
    "let us first look at the effect of a small perturbation in @xmath0 in the sense that the potential term dominates over the coupling term in the klein - gordon equation .",

    "the behaviour of @xmath150 and @xmath151 in function of @xmath136 is shown on figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "when @xmath1 , we see that , as expected , the solution is first dominated by the potential term but that , as time elapses the coupling term tends to become more dominant . in figure [ fig2 ] , we illustrate how the phase space trajectories are deformed due to the existence of this small coupling .",
    "now , as long as @xmath152 , we can compute the equation of state of the field by inserting the particular part of the solution ( [ toto ] ) in ( [ rhophi]-[pphi ] ) which will take the form @xmath153 the difference in these two behaviours comes from the fact that @xmath154 if @xmath155 and @xmath156 when @xmath66 .",

    "in conclusion we have that when @xmath1 and @xmath152 , the field converges towards a barotropic fluid .",

    "the general case is more involved since we can not find any analytic solution to ( [ kg_exp ] ) .",
    "first , when @xmath165 , we have seen that when either the potential or the coupling term dominates , the other slowly catch up .",
    "we thus expect a late time solution which satisfies @xmath178 in figure [ fig4 ] , we plot the evolution of these two terms in the case where @xmath1 and in a more general case .",
    "the two terms alternatively dominate and then converge to the same value . indeed ,",
    "this is no proof .",
    "+ we can however look for a general solution of the form @xmath179 with @xmath180 given by ( [ sol_exp ] ) and @xmath181 given by ( [ toto ] ) . inserting this expansion in the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg_exp ] ) , we obtain the hierarchy of equations @xmath182 the functions @xmath183 depends on all the solutions @xmath184 for @xmath185 .",
    "all these equations have a solution of the form @xmath186 as in  [ petit1 ] , the two homogeneous modes decay if @xmath142 and @xmath187 .",

    ", we show the phase space trajectories showing the convergence towards this attractor .",
    "when @xmath191 , the solution converges towards the attractor while oscillating so that the equation of state have wiggles and converges towards @xmath192 ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",

    "the solution ( [ toto ] ) reduces to the two decaying modes . indeed",
    "the derivation of ( [ t2 ] ) is no longer valid but , with the same method , one can show that , to first order in @xmath161 , @xmath193 where the two functions @xmath157 and @xmath158 are obained as in  [ petit1 ] . note that for @xmath194 the @xmath0 terms of ( [ rhophi]-[pphi ] ) dominates the density and the pressure . in figure [ fig5 ] , we have plotted the phase space showing the convergence towards the attractor @xmath96 in the case of a conformally coupled scalar field and the evolution of its equation of state .",

    "in this article , we studied the influence of the coupling between the scalar curvature and the scalar field on the existence and stability of scaling solution of this field evolving in either an exponential or an inverse power law potential .",
    "the motivation for considering such solutions is first that they can be a candidate for a matter component with negative pressure and second that they appear for a large class of potentials predicted by some theories of hight energy physics .",
    "we first found a new parametric form of the potential that reduces to the inverse power law potential when the energy density of the fluid drives the evolution of the spacetime .",
    "concerning the inverse power law potentials , we showed analytically that the existence and stability of a scaling solution does not depend on the coupling @xmath0 and that the equation of state of the field was always given by @xmath204 .",

    "we then studied the effect of a small perturbation coupled to the scalar curvature and computed @xmath94 to first order in @xmath1 and showed that there always exists a time after which one can not neglect the effect of the coupling . in that limit",
    ", we show that the equation of state was converging towards a barotropic equation of state and some numerical examples tend to show us that it should be the case whatever @xmath165 ( but this has not been demonstrated ) . indeed",
    ", such potentials are not the most favored since they are constrained by nucleosynthesis to @xmath69 @xcite and can not explain ( when @xmath23 ) the supernovae measurements since @xmath70 .",
    "note however that the convergence toward the barotropic equation @xmath192 is much slower when @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath171 , we have shown that there always exists a time after which the coupling term will dominate and thus that there exists a scaling solution but with a different equation of state ( as long as @xmath168 , and thus in a matter dominated era ) .",
    "unfortunately , such a solution has to be rejected since it has negative energy .    as pointed out by caldwell _",
