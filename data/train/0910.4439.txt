    "the discrete painlev equations have been studied actively from various points of view . together with the painlev equations , they are now regarded as one of the most important classes of equations in the theory of integrable systems ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "originally , the discrete painlev equations had been identified as single second - order equations@xcite and then were generalized to simultaneous first - order equations .",
    "a typical example is the following equation known as a discrete painlev ii equation@xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dependent variable , @xmath5 is the independent variable , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath9 are parameters . by applying the singularity confinement criterion@xcite , ( [ sdp2:eqn ] )",
    "is generalized to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a parameter , with its integrability preserved . introducing the dependent variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 by @xmath14",
    "then ( [ adp2:eqn1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath15 equation ( [ adp2:eqn ] ) is known as a discrete painlev iii equation since it admits a continuous limit to the painlev iii equation@xcite .",
    "conversely , ( [ sdp2:eqn ] ) can be recovered from ( [ adp2:eqn ] ) by putting @xmath16 and ( [ dp2:specialization ] ) .",
    "we call this procedure `` _ symmetrization _ '' of ( [ adp2:eqn ] ) , which comes from the terminology of the quispel  roberts  thompson ( qrt ) mapping@xcite . after this terminology , ( [ adp2:eqn ] )",
    "is sometimes called the `` _ asymmetric _ '' discrete painlev ii equation , and ( [ sdp2:eqn ] ) is called the `` _ symmetric _ '' discrete painlev iii equation@xcite .",
    "it looks that the symmetrization is a simple specialization of parameters at the level of the equation , but some strange phenomena have been reported as to their particular solutions expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions ( _ hypergeometric solutions _ ) .",
    "the hypergeometric solutions to ( [ sdp2:eqn ] ) have been constructed as follows @xcite :    [ prop : sdp2 ] for each @xmath17 , let @xmath18 be an @xmath19 determinant defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a function satisfying the three - term relation@xmath22 @xmath23 then , @xmath24 satisfies ( [ sdp2:eqn ] ) with the parameters",
    "@xmath25    on the other hand , since ( [ adp2:eqn ] ) appears as the bcklund transformation of the painlev v equation@xcite , its hypergeometric solutions are essentially the same as those to the painlev v equation@xcite .",
    "the explicit form of the hypergeometric solutions to ( [ adp2:eqn ] ) are given as follows :    [ prop : adp2 ] for each @xmath17 , let @xmath26 be an @xmath19 determinant defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a function satisfying @xmath29 then , @xmath30 satisfy ( [ adp2:eqn ] ) with the parameters @xmath31    it is obvious that substituting @xmath16 into the hypergeometric solutions to ( [ adp2:eqn ] ) in proposition [ prop : adp2 ] do not yield those to ( [ sdp2:eqn ] ) in proposition [ prop : sdp2 ] . in particular , we remark the following differences between the two solutions :    ( i ) : :    the hypergeometric functions are different .",
    "equation    ( [ dp2:hyper_entries ] ) can be solved by the parabolic cylinder function    ( weber function ) , while ( [ adp2:hyper_entries ] ) can be solved by the    confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "in fact , the former function is    expressed as a specialization of the latter , but this specialization    is not consistent with the symmetrization ; ( ii ) : :    structures of the determinant are different .",
    "the determinant    ( [ sdp2:tau ] ) has asymmetry in the shift of index : the shift in the    vertical direction is one while that in the horizontal direction is    two . on the other hand ,",
    "the determinant ( [ adp2:tau ] ) is an ordinary    hankel determinant .",
    "we note that similar phenomena have been reported also for some other discrete painlev equations@xcite .",
    "many integrable systems admit particular solutions expressed in terms of determinants , but such an asymmetric structure of the determinant solutions has been seen only in the hypergeometric solutions to the discrete painlev equations .",
    "note here that these phenomena can not be seen for the algebraic ( or rational ) solutions .",
    "for example , it is known that substituting @xmath16 into the determinant expression of the rational solutions to ( [ adp2:eqn ] ) yields those to ( [ sdp2:eqn ] ) ; see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 function is one of the most important objects in the theory of integrable systems and is regarded as carrying the underlying fundamental mathematical structures .",
    "concerning the discrete painlev equations , investigation of the @xmath2 functions started @xcite through the search for the explicit formulae of the hypergeometric and algebraic solutions .",
    "in fact , the above mysterious asymmetric structure has been one motivation of further study .",
    "it is now known that theory of birational representations of affine weyl groups provides us with an algebraic tool to study the painlev systems@xcite .",
    "moreover , a geometric framework of the two - dimensional painlev systems has been presented based on certain rational surfaces@xcite .",
    "combining these results enables us to study the painlev systems effectively .",
    "for instance , it played a crucial role in the identification of hypergeometric functions that appear as the particular solutions to the painlev systems in sakai s classification@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the mechanism of the phenomena of hypergeometric solutions from the viewpoint of the affine weyl group symmetry .",
    "we shall take the @xmath0-painlev equation of type @xmath1 as an example , which is the simplest non - trivial discrete painlev system@xcite .",
    "the key is to formulate the symmetrization in terms of the birational representation of the affine weyl group , where the discrete painlev equation arises from the action of the translational subgroup .",
    "in fact , the discrete time evolution of the symmetric case comes from a `` half - step '' of a translation of the affine weyl group through a restriction to a certain line in the parameter space .",
    "conversely , we can derive various discrete painlev equations from elements of infinite order that are not necessarily translations by taking a projection on a certain subspace of the parameters .",
    "we call such a procedure to obtain a `` smaller '' discrete time evolution of painlev type a _ projective reduction_.    this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce a @xmath0-painlev iii equation and derive a @xmath0-painlev ii equation by applying the symmetrization",
    ". then we give a brief review on their hypergeometric solutions . in section 3",
    ", we first introduce the family of bcklund transformations of the @xmath0-painlev iii equation , which is a birational representation of the affine weyl group of type @xmath1 .",
    "we next lift the representation on the level of @xmath2 functions and derive various bilinear equations .",
    "we then clarify the mechanism of the inconsistency among the hypergeometric solutions by using this framework .",
