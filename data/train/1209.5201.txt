    "high - order models have recently attracted considerable interests in the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) community . for these models ,",
    "high - order terms in the expanded distribution function are retained , thus multi - speed lattices have to be used . by doing so , we have a few benefits , e.g. consistent description of thermal flows , the galilean invariance of the transport coefficients , improved model capability for compressible and rarefied flows@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , high - order models can still preserve the simplicity of the standard lb model .",
    "high - order lb models are tererfore often applied to thermal flows , compressible flows , and rarefied flows @xcite .    due to their kinetic origin ,",
    "high - order lb models have shown to be able to approach the boltzmann model equation such as the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) equation by increasing the expansion and quadrature order@xcite .",
    "numerically , it is found that high - order models are capable of describing rarefaction effects up to the early transitional regime with slightly increased discrete velocities .",
    "for example , the velocity - slip can be captured by a d2q16 model for the knudsen number up to @xmath0 where d@xmath1q@xmath2 refers to the standard @xmath1 dimenional and @xmath2 discrete velocities .",
    "a recent study on thermal flows shows that thermal rarefaction effects can also be captured by using a moderate number of discrete velocities with an affordable computational cost@xcite .",
    "in addition to capturing the non - equilibrium effects , high - order models are also useful for other applications .",
    "for instance , by using a d2q25 model , daniel et at@xcite have shown that high weber number can be achievable for droplet collision simulations .",
    "implementation of boundary conditions is crucial to application of high - order lb models .",
    "the kinetic diffuse - reflection boundary condition has shown to be able to predict velocity - slip and temperature - jump at the solid boundary . moreover ,",
    "the positivity of distribution function can always be maintained ( provided that the distribution function from the bulk is positive ) , which is key to numerical stability .",
    "however , due to the multi - speed lattice of high - order models , the formulation of the kinetic diffuse - reflection boundary condition with the characteristic `` streaming and collision '' mechanism is yet to be developed .",
    "the successful implementations so far for high - order models are based on various finite difference scheme @xcite , where the highly desirable `` streaming and collision '' mechanism disappears .",
    "because of this `` streaming and collision '' mechanism , lb method is often regarded a particle method .",
    "the purpose of this work is to formulate the kinetic diffuse reflection boundary condition to retain the `` streaming and collision '' feature .",
    "the boltzmann - bgk equation can be dicretized using a systematic procedure ( see @xcite for the details ) to derive the lb governing equation , which can be written as    @xmath3    where @xmath4 denotes the single - particle distribution function evaluated at a discrete velocity @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the truncated maxwellian distribution , while @xmath7 is the mean relaxation time . for convenience",
    ", a non - dimensional system    @xmath8    @xmath9 can be introduced in eq.([lbgk ] ) , where the symbols with hat represent the dimensional quantities .",
    "the common notations are used to represent physical quantities , i.e. @xmath10 denotes density ; @xmath11 , dynamic viscosity ; @xmath12 , velocity ; @xmath13 , pressure ; @xmath14 , temperature ; @xmath15 , stress and @xmath16 , heat flux .",
    "@xmath17 is the characteristic length of the system .",
    "the symbols with subscript @xmath18 are the corresponding reference quantities . with this non - dimensional system ,",
    "the equation of state becomes @xmath19 .",
    "the mean relaxation time can be written explicitly as @xmath20 , which is related to the viscosity and pressure . meanwhile",
    ", the macroscopic quantities can be obtained as    @xmath21=\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d}f_{\\alpha}\\left[\\begin{array}{c } 1\\\\ c_{\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\alpha},}i}\\\\ c_{<\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\alpha},}i}c_{\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\alpha},}j>}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}c_{\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\alpha},}i}c_{\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\alpha},}i}c_{\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\alpha},}j}\\\\ c_{\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\alpha},}i}c_{\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\alpha},}i } \\end{array}\\right],\\label{eq : summac}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the space dimension number and @xmath23 is the total discrete velocity number and the angle brackets @xmath24 indicates the trace - free part of the tensor .",
    "the discrete velocity @xmath5 and its weights @xmath25 may be determined through several ways , e.g. , @xcite list explicitly various orders of discrete velocity sets . for convenience",
    ", we use the notation @xmath26 to represent the discrete velocity set . with an appropriate @xmath27 ,",
    "the explicit form of the truncated maxwellian distribution can be given as @xmath28\\right.\\label{eq : feq}\\\\   & + & \\frac{c_{i}u_{i}}{6}[(c_{i}u_{i})^{2}-3u_{i}u_{i}+3(t-1)(c_{i}c_{i}-d-2)]\\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\frac{1}{24}[(c_{i}u_{i})^{4}-6(u_{i}c_{i})^{2}u_{j}u_{j}+3(u_{j}u_{j})^{2}]\\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\frac{t-1}{4}[(c_{i}c_{i}-d-2)((u_{i}c_{i})^{2}-u_{i}u_{i})-2(u_{i}c_{i})^{2}]\\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\frac{(t-1)^{2}}{8}\\left.\\left[(c_{i}c_{i})^{2}-2(d+2)c_{i}c_{i}+d(d+2)\\right]\\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the forth order expansion is used .",
    "if an isothermal flow is concerned , the temperature @xmath14 should be set to @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , to simulate incompressible flows , it is common to use only the second order terms of @xmath30 .    with eq.([lbgk ] ) and ( [ eq : feq ] ) , the final issue is to choose an appropriate numerical scheme . following the spirit of `` streaming and collision '' mechanism @xcite , an implicit scheme    @xmath31\\\\   & + & \\frac{dt}{2\\tau(\\bm{x}+\\bm{c}_{\\alpha}dt , t+dt)}\\left[f_{\\alpha}^{eq}(\\bm{x}+\\bm{c}_{\\alpha}dt , t+dt)-f_{\\alpha}(\\bm{x}+\\bm{c}_{\\alpha}dt , t+dt)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    can be constructed .",
    "if we introduce a new variable    @xmath32 to eliminate the implicitness , we will get the evolution equation for@xmath33 as    @xmath34.\\label{eq : scheme}\\ ] ]    the advantage of eq.([eq : scheme ] ) is that , if the discrete velocities are tied to discretization of the space and time by choosing @xmath27 with integer value , the evolution of @xmath35 can be accomplished in a way similar to a `` particle '' , which makes the lb method simple but still flexible .    with the variable @xmath35 , conservative quantities like density can still be obtained by using eq.([eq : summac ] ) without changing form but some conversions are needed for shear stress and heat flux ( cf .",
    "in addition , the mean relaxation time @xmath7 may be related to the local gas temperature for thermal problems .",
    "the essential idea of the kinetic diffuse - reflection boundary condition is that an outgoing particle completely forgets its history and its velocity is re - normalized by the maxwellian distribution . to implement this diffuse - reflection principle for the high - order lb model , we will follow the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the discussion is based on the assumption that the effective particle - wall interaction time is small compared to any characteristic time of interest and no permanent adsorption occurs@xcite .    for the high - order models , as `` particles '' from more than one layer of computational grids can hit the wall , we have to properly identify them in order to implement the boundary condition . for this purpose ,",
    "@xmath36 layers of ghost grids are introduced ( see the example of the d2q17 lattice and its grid arrangement shown in fig.[fig : d2q17-lattice ] and [ fig : illustration ] ) , where @xmath36 can be determined via the corresponding maximum value of the discrete velocity heading towards the wall ( e.g. , @xmath37 for the d2q17 lattice ) . as a common practice",
    ", the physical wall is located at the half grid space between the ghost and fluid grids . to further distinguish incoming and outgoing particles , we use @xmath38 and @xmath39 to represent their velocities respectively , where @xmath40 denotes the layer number of the ghost grid ranging from @xmath18 to @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the distributions of incoming and outgoing particles at layer @xmath40 are written as @xmath42@xmath43 and @xmath44 , where the superscripts @xmath45 and @xmath46 stand for ` incoming ' and ` outgoing ' .",
    "the corresponding discrete velocities must satisfy the condition @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 denotes the unit vector normal to the wall surface @xmath50 at @xmath51 and directed from the wall into the gas .",
    "note in the present lattice system @xmath52 so the conditions are equivalent to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are a symmetric pair . on the other hand ,",
    "the known information of the wall , i.e. , the position , velocity and temperature , are represented by @xmath55,@xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "obviously , the distribution @xmath42@xmath43 can be obtained by naturally streaming the distribution function at fluid grids into the corresponding ghost ones .",
    "we need to determine the unknown distribution @xmath44 according to the principle of diffusion reflection .",
    "similar to the derivation of the continuum version of diffusion - reflection condition @xcite , we first write down the mass of outgoing and incoming particles as ,    @xmath58    @xmath59    where @xmath60 stands for mass and @xmath61 denotes the volume of the grid cell .",
    "it is worth noting again here that , due to the exact advection of the lb method ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq : scheme ] ) ) , the flux term in the continuum version ( cf .",
    "( 1.11.1 ) in @xcite ) , can be replaced by the distribution function itself .",
    "hence , according to the mass conservation , we have ,    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the so - called scattering probability .",
    "immediately , we arrive at    @xmath64    moreover , the scattering probability @xmath65 must satisfy the property of non - negativeness , normalization and reciprocity condition@xcite .",
    "particularly , the normalization condition , corresponding to mass conservation under the assumption of no permanent adsorption , can be written as ,    @xmath66    so far , the discussion is still generic as we have not introduced any specific assumption for the diffuse - reflection principle .",
    "therefore , the above formulation may also be used to derive other type of boundary condition .",
    "if the assumption of the diffuse - reflection boundary condition is applied , the scattering probability can be easily calculated as    @xmath67    hence , the distributions of outgoing particles can be written as @xmath68",
    "to validate the proposed implementation of kinetic boundary condition , we consider steady couette flow confined in two parallel planar plates located at @xmath69 and @xmath70 and moving oppositely with the same speed .",
    "all the quantities are presented in their non - dimensional form , and both isothermal and thermal conditions are considered .",
    "therefore , three lattice systems , namely d2q17@xcite , d2q16@xcite and d3q121@xcite are tested , where the d2q17 and d2q16 models are appropriate for the isothermal cases and the d3q121 model for the thermal ones .",
    "the d2q17 lattice is illustrated in fig.[fig : d2q17-lattice ] and the corresponding grid arrangement is shown in fig.[fig : illustration ] .",

    "the point denotes the bulk grid while the dashed circle represents the ghost grid .",
    "[ fig : illustration],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we restrict to the couette flow within the slip - flow regime , so we may be able to use solutions of the navier - stokes - fourier ( ns ) equations as reference .",
    "for the ns solutions , it is necessary to apply the velocity - slip and temperature - jump boundary conditions so that the velocity and temperature profiles can be written as    @xmath71    and @xmath72 where the knudsen number is defined as @xmath73 @xmath74 denotes magnitude of the component of interest of the wall velocity @xmath56 . for some relatively larger knudsen numbers we may also compare to the solution of the linearized boltzmann - bgk ( l - bgk ) equation .",
    "we first evaluate the d2q17 and d2q16 models for isothermal flows which are presented in fig.[fig : isothermal - case ] and [ fig : isothermal - case-1 ] , where @xmath74 is set to be @xmath75 .",
    "both models are simulated with @xmath76 computational grids in the direction of interest and the comparisons are made against the ns solutions for @xmath77 and the l - bgk solutions for @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the results show that the boundary condition eq.([eq : dkboundary ] ) works correctly for the isothermal flows . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the velocity profiles are captured well by the d2q17 model while some deviations from the l - bgk results are observed for larger knudsen numbers , particularly at @xmath80 ( see fig.[fig : isothermal - case ] ) .",
    "however , this is of no surprise as it is known that these deviations are due to the lattice structure@xcite . a further comparison to the finite difference ( fd ) implementation of eq.([lbgk ] ) ( see the description in @xcite , where the numerical simulation is validated by the analytical solution in @xcite ) , confirms the appropriateness of the boundary implementation .",
    "interestingly , the d2q16 model can given much better predictions for the velocity profile .",
