    "it is therefore of interest to quantify the entanglement produced by quantum algorithms and examine its correlation with their efficiency .",

    "the special case of bipartite entanglement has been studied extensively in recent years .",

    "the entanglement of pure bipartite states can be evaluated by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix , traced over one of the parties . for mixed bipartite states ,",
    "several measures were proposed , namely entanglement of formation and entanglement of distillation @xcite . in particular , for states of two qubits an exact formula for the entanglement of formation was obtained @xcite .",
    "bipartite pure states of more than two qubits were also studied .",
    "it was shown that generic quantum states can be reconstructed from a fraction of the reduced density matrices , obtained by tracing over some of the qubits @xcite .",

    "recent work based on axiomatic considerations has provided a set of properties that entanglement measures should satisfy @xcite .",

    "quantities that satisfy these properties are called entanglement monotones . these properties",
    ", that should be satisfied for bipartite as well as multipartite entanglement , provide useful guidelines in the search for entanglement measures for multipartite quantum states .",
