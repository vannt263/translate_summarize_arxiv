    "t  hooft operators @xcite play a central role in recent studies of the montonen - olive duality @xcite as electric - magetic duals of the polyakov - wilson operators @xcite .",
    "their significance as hecke operators in the geometric langlands program is elucidated in @xcite .    by a t  hooft operator",
    "we understand a line operator such that in the three - dimensional space transverse to the line it amounts to an insertion of a dirac monopole imbedded into the gauge group in question . in other words , in the vicinity of an insertion point in the three - dimensional space ,",
    "we impose the following boundary conditions @xcite on the gauge fields @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the volume form of a unit sphere surrounding the point and @xmath5 is the lie algebra element satisfying @xmath6 the t  hooft charge of such an operator takes values in @xmath7 it vanishes if the gauge group @xmath8 is @xmath1 and is @xmath9 valued if @xmath8 is @xmath10 strictly speaking only the operators with nonzero t  hooft charge are significant in @xcite , but here we forgo this restriction and adopt the more general definition of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a minimal t  hooft operator is an insertion of a dirac monopole of the lowest possible charge .",
    "here we focus on such minimal operator insertions .",
    "the exact analytic solutions we present in section [ sec : solutions ] probe minimal t  hooft operators with a monopole .",
    "these solutions are new and can be interpreted as a nonlinear superposition of a dirac monopole imbedded in the gauge group and a t  hooft - polyakov monopole .",
    "these configurations arise in various theories .",
    "the most relevant to the electric - magnetic duality setting mentioned above is to view these as solutions in the maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory in four dimensional space - time . in that case",
    "the dirac monopole singularity is interpreted as a t  hooft time - like line operator .",
    "this is a codimension two operator . under the electric - magnetic duality",
    "such operators are mapped to wilson line operators .",
    "since wilson lines can terminate on quarks , a natural question posed by the duality is what the dual of this phenomenon is .",
    "what is the point , i.e. codimension three , operator that the t  hooft line can end on ? a natural candidate is the t  hooft - polyakov monopole .",
    "this suggestion , however , faces the following difficulty .",
    "while the field configuration near the t  hooft operator insertion line is singular and the operator itself is concentrated on a line , the t  hooft - polyakov monopole configuration is smooth and has a definite size . viewed in the three - dimensional space the question is : how can a finite size smooth object screen a point like singularity ? having obtained exact solutions , we explore this screening effect in detail in section [ sec : analysis ] .    before we describe the field configurations we are after , we would like to emphasize that our solutions can be interpreted in a number of other theories .",
    "they arise as half - bps configurations in the @xmath11 super - yang - mills in four dimensions . in string theory",
    "they provide a d(p+2)-brane world - volume description of a pair of parallel d(p+2)-branes connected by a finite dp - brane with one or two semi - infinite dp - branes ending on the pair .",
    "these solutions also arise in the context of a pure yang - mills theory at finite temperature . in this case",
    "the field @xmath12 in our expressions should be interpreted as a euclidian time component @xmath13 of the gauge field and the bogomolny equation ( [ eq : bogomolny ] ) as a self - duality condition on @xmath14 for @xmath15 independent configurations .",
    "our solutions are static and are described by the fields @xmath16 on a three - dimensional space depending on the coordinate vector @xmath17 we denote the relative position of the observation point @xmath18 with respect to the position of the t  hooft operator by @xmath19 while the relative position of the observation point with respect to the position of the center of the t  hooft - polyakov monopole is denoted by @xmath20 we consider maximal symmetry breaking at infinity with the symmetry breaking scale @xmath21 set by the higgs field eigenvalues at the space infinity .",
    "now we spell out the exact conditions on the gauge field @xmath22 and the higgs field @xmath12 describing a single monopole in the presence of an t  hooft operator .",
    "bps monopoles @xcite with t  hooft operator insertions are solutions of the bogomolny equation @xcite @xmath23,\\ ] ] with prescribed dirac type singularities .",
    "explicitly , for the minimal charge , the condition ( [ eq : minimal ] ) implies that the higgs field near the insertion point at @xmath24 is gauge equivalent to @xmath25 the above conditions are written is a particular gauge for concreteness . of course",
    ", one can perform any everywhere smooth gauge transformation to obtain an equivalent description . here",
    "@xmath26 is a completely antisymmetric tensor and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the pauli sigma matrices .    to simplify our notation we denote the distances from the observation point to the singularity and to the monopole by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . when the separation @xmath31 between the t  hooft operator insertion and the nonabelian monopole is large , i.e. @xmath32 we expect the fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 to approach those of the t  hooft - polyakov bps monopole solution @xcite @xmath36    we present the solutions satisfying the above conditions in section [ sec : solutions ] and analyze them in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we used the technique of the nahm transform @xcite , outlined in the appendix , to obtain the explicit solutions presented here .",
    "more general solutions with two singularities appear in @xcite .",
    "the solutions below are exact and have been explicitly verified analytically and numerically .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath37 and to use the vector - valued functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 then the monopole solutions of the bogomolny eq .",
    "( [ eq : bogomolny ] ) satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ eq : so3 ] ) and ( [ eq : su2 ] ) are provided by eq.([genso3 ] ) and eq.([gensu2 ] ) above with @xmath40 and @xmath41 given respectively as follows :    @xmath42 * case : * @xmath43 where @xmath44    @xmath45 * case : * @xmath46 where @xmath47",
    "the form of the expressions ( [ eq : so(3)fields ] ) and ( [ eq : su(2)fields ] ) makes the large separation limit transparent . indeed ,",
    "in this limit the fields near the t  hooft operator insertion @xmath48 reproduce those of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : so3],[eq : su2 ] ) , while near the monopole core @xmath49 they approach the t  hooft - polyakov solution ( [ eq : thp1 ] , [ eq : thp2 ] ) .",
    "there is a substantial difference in the behavior of these solutions as we decrease @xmath50 and the nonabelian monopole and the t  hooft operator collide .",
    "the @xmath0 solution at @xmath51 becomes another t  hooft operator with the higgs field @xmath52 while the @xmath1 solution in this limit becomes trivial with @xmath53 and @xmath12 constant .",
    "the latter illustrates the screening effect , in which a nonabelian monopole completely screens the point - like singularity of the t  hooft operator . a priori",
    "one might think such screening impossible since the t  hooft - polyakov monopole has a finite size of order @xmath54 and finite energy density in the core , while the dirac singularity of the t  hooft operator is pointlike with the energy density divergent at one point .",
    "electric - magnetic duality , however , suggests such screening as a possible dual explanation of screening of wilson line operators by quarks .",
    "our solution ( [ eq : su(2)fields ] ) resolves this seeming contradiction as we now explain .",
    "there is a number of ways to explore the size of the monopole .",
    "one is via the energy density distribution @xmath55 and another is by how much the gauge symmetry is broken by the higgs field .",
    "in particular , we might think of the position of the monopole as the point where the higgs field vanishes and the gauge symmetry is fully restored . a word of caution is due here . even though the parameter @xmath56 is a good indication of the monopole relative position when @xmath50 is large",
    ", it is not the point where the higgs field vanishes , rather , at @xmath56 ( i.e. at @xmath57 ) we have @xmath58 for the two gauge groups the profiles of @xmath59 at large separation parameter @xmath50 look remarkably similar to each other .",
    "they do differ drastically , however , for small values of @xmath60 one can infer from figs .",
    "[ contour](a ) and [ contour](b ) how the position and size of the monopole vary with @xmath50 .",
    "the shaded areas in these graphs corresponds to the values of @xmath61 and we choose the asymptotic condition to be @xmath62 the coordinate @xmath63 is chosen along the line originating at the t  hooft operator and passing through the monopole .",
    "the dark area in the middle corresponds to the values of @xmath64 giving a good indication of the position of the monopole center .    in the case of the @xmath1 gauge group ,",
    "[ contour](b ) , the monopole shrinks to zero size as it approaches the singularity and screens the t  hooft operator completely . in the case of the @xmath0 gauge group ,",
    "as the parameter @xmath65 the longitudinal size of the monopole decreases somewhat , approaching a constant . instead of the monopole shrinking to zero size , we observe it spreading transversely and eventually encircling the singularity .",
    "this is also indicated by the expression ( [ eq : final ] ) representing the limiting configuration to be an t  hooft operator surrounded by a sphere of vanishing higgs field at @xmath66    energy density plots of figs .",
    "[ energydensity](a ) and [ energydensity](b ) support this picture .",
    "they present the contour levels of @xmath67 which is proportional to the energy density @xmath68 due to bogomolny eq .",
    "( [ eq : bogomolny ] ) and the bianchi identity . as @xmath69 the energy density for the @xmath0 gauge group case approaches a steady distribution diverging at the origin , while for the @xmath1 case the energy density decreases uniformly and , at @xmath70 vanishes everywhere .",
    "one can view the two solutions discussed here as part of the same picture since every @xmath1 solution can be viewed as one with the gauge group @xmath0 by factoring out the center of the group .",
    "thus , we can reinterpret eq.([eq : su(2)fields ] ) combined with eq.([genso3 ] ) as an @xmath0 monopole with the charge two t  hooft operator insertion .",
    "such an interpretation provides a topological reason for our observations in the previous section . for the gauge group @xmath0 the t  hooft charge takes value in @xmath71 the solution ( [ genso3 ] , [ eq : so(3)fields ] ) has t  hooft charge one operator insertion and",
    "thus it is topologically protected .",
    "the solution ( [ genso3 ] , [ eq : su(2)fields ] ) , however , has dirac charge two and vanishing t hooft charge operator insertion which , as a result , can be screened completely .",
    "one can view the latter charge two configuration as a limit of two minimal t  hooft operators approaching each other .",
    "we explore such a limit in more detail in @xcite .",

    "here we briefly outline the nahm transform techniques , which led us to the solutions presented . for the configuration of one nonabelian @xmath1 monopole positioned at @xmath72 in the presence of a minimally charged t  hooft operator at @xmath73",
    "we denote the relative positions by @xmath74 we also let @xmath75 and @xmath76            the relevant nahm data for this case is given by a piecewise constant vector - valued function @xmath81 and a 2-component spinor @xmath82 satisfying @xmath83 it follows that it satisfies @xmath84 for convenience we also define spinors @xmath85 and @xmath86 satisfying @xmath87    the next step of the nahm transform is for any observation point @xmath18 to define the following weyl operator @xmath88 acting on @xmath89 and to find solutions of the equation @xmath90 in our case it has two dimensional space of solutions .",
    "we organize an orthonormal basis @xmath91 in this space into a matrix @xmath92 so that the @xmath93-th column is the @xmath93-th element of this basis .",
    "formulating the nahm transform for the @xmath0 case is completely analogous , even though the computations are a little more tedious . in this case",
    "the nahm data is defined on the whole real line with discontinuities at @xmath100 also , besides the @xmath101 spinor accounting for the discontinuity in the nahm data at @xmath102 we also have a spinor @xmath103 corresponding to the discontinuity at @xmath104 we present the brane configuration for the corresponding nahm data in fig .",
