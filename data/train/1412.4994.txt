    "the notion of a _ word - representable _ graph was first defined in @xcite .",

    "for example , the cycle graph on four vertices labeled by 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 in clockwise direction can be represented by the word 14213243 .",
    "word - representable graphs have been studied in a series of papers @xcite@xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite , and they will be the main subject of an up - coming book  @xcite .",
    "the first examples of graphs that are not word - representable were given in @xcite .",
    "in fact , v. limouzy [ private communication , 2014 ] noticed that it is np - hard to determine whether a given graph is word - representable , see @xcite for the details . in @xcite",

    ", we will show that for every @xmath17 , every graph is @xmath18-representable .",

    "for example , we will show that not every graph is @xmath19-representable .",
    "in particular , the cycles @xmath51 for @xmath52 are not @xmath19-representable .",
    "we will also show that there are non-@xmath19-representable trees , which contrasts with the fact that every tree is @xmath16-representable .",

    "we will prove that a tree @xmath54 is @xmath19-representable if and only if @xmath54 is a double caterpillar .",
    "further , we will show that the class of 12-representable graphs is properly included in the class of comparability graphs , and it properly includes the classes of co - interval graphs and permutation graphs as shown in figure  [ overview ] .",
    "it turns out that the notion of @xmath19-representable graphs is a natural generalization of the notion of permutation graphs .",
    "figure  [ overview ] also gives examples of graphs inside / outside the involved graph classes .",
    "for instance , even cycles of length at least 6 , being comparability graphs , are not 12-representable ( see theorem  [ cycles - thm ] in section  [ 12-matching - repr ] ) ; also , odd wheels on six or more vertices are not 11-representable @xcite .",

    "finally , in section  [ other - notions ] , we introduce a number of new ways to define representability of simple graphs , directed graphs , and hypergraphs via words subject to certain pattern avoidance conditions .",
    "we also define several analogues of _ wilf - equivalencies _ in section  [ other - notions ] , which are yet to be studied .",
