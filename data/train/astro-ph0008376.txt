    "neutron stars are spotted as pulsars by radio telescopes and x - ray satellites .",
    "they are more massive ( i.e. @xmath1 ) than our sun but are typically only about @xmath2 kilometers across so that the matter in their centers is compressed to densities that are up to an order of magnitude higher than the density of atomic nuclei @xcite . at such densities",
    "it is quite plausible that numerous subatomic particle processes will compete with each other and novel phases of matter  like the quark - gluon plasma being sought at the most powerful terrestrial particle colliders  could exist in the center of neutron stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross ] summarizes the possible scenarios graphically , with the associated equations of state  shown in figure  [ fig : eos ] .",
    "the strangeness - carrying @xmath3 quark is likely to play a vital role inside neutron stars , for several of the building blocks of matter may contain an @xmath3 quark as one of their constituents .",
    "examples are the hyperons @xmath4 , the @xmath5 meson , and the h - dibaryon .",
    "more than that , strangeness may also exist in the form of unconfined @xmath3 quarks , which could populate , in chemical equilibrium with @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks and/or hadrons , extended regions inside neutron stars .",
    "this paper aims at giving a brief overview of the possible manifestations of strangeness inside neutron stars .",
    "it is most noteworthy that these objects can nowadays be observed  with state - of - the - art radio telescopes ( e.g.  arecibo , jodrell bank , parkes , vla ) and x - ray satellites ( e.g.  chandra , hst , rxte , xmm )  with such a remarkable clarity that previously was only imagined , which enables us for the first time ever to seriously constrain the properties of superdense matter from astrophysical observations .",
    "only in the most primitive conception , a neutron star is constituted from neutrons . at a more accurate representation",
    ", a such stars will contain neutrons ( @xmath8 ) and a small number of protons ( @xmath9 ) whose charge is balanced by leptons ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) . at the densities in the interiors of neutron stars , the neutron chemical potential , @xmath12 , easily exceeds the mass ( modified by interactions ) of the @xmath13 which then allows neutrons to transform into @xmath13 s .",
    "mathematically , this is expressed as @xmath14 , which indicates that for neutron fermi momenta greater than @xmath15 , @xmath13 particles could make their appearance .",
    "such fermi momenta correspond to densities of just @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the baryon number density of ordinary nuclear matter .",
    "so , in addition to nucleons and electrons , neutron stars may be expected to hide considerable populations of strangeness - carrying @xmath13 hyperons , eventually accompanied with @xmath18 and @xmath19 hyperon populations too @xcite",
    ". the total hyperon population may be as large as 20% @xcite .",
    "once the reaction @xmath20 becomes possible in a neutron star , it is energetically advantageous for the star to replace the fermionic electrons with the bosonic @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the associated chemical potentials must obey @xmath21 . whether or not this is actually fulfilled in neutron stars depends on the mass of the @xmath5 in dense matter .",
    "information about this is provided by the @xmath5 kinetic energy spectra extracted from ni+ni collisions at sis energies , as measured by the kaos collaboration at gsi @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the kaos data shows that the attraction from nuclear matter may bring the @xmath5 mass down to @xmath22 at @xmath23 . for neutron - rich matter",
    ", the relation @xmath24 was established @xcite , with @xmath25  mev the @xmath5 vacuum mass .",
    "values around @xmath22 lie in the vicinity of the electron chemical potential , @xmath26 , in neutron star matter @xcite so that the threshold condition for the onset of @xmath5 condensation , @xmath27 , could be fulfilled in the cores of neutron stars .",
    "the situation is graphically illustrated in figure [ fig : kmass ] , with the uncertainties inherent in the calculations indicted by the shaded regions .",
    "similar to the @xmath28 condensate , a @xmath5 condensate would also soften the equation of state  and enhance the star s neutrino luminosity @xcite .",
    "the softening of the equation of state  can be quite substantial , as pointed in @xcite , reducing the maximum neutron star mass from @xmath29 to about @xmath30 .",
    "based on this , the existence of a large number of low - mass black holes in the galaxy was proposed @xcite .",
    "another boson that could make its appearance in the center of a neutron star is the so - called h - dibaryon , a doubly strange six - quark composite with spin and isospin zero , and baryon number two @xcite . since its first prediction in 1977",
    ", the h - dibaryon has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies as a possible candidate for a strongly bound exotic state . in neutron stars , which may contain a significant fraction of @xmath13 hyperons ,",
    "the @xmath13 s could combine to form h - dibaryons , which could give way to the formation of h - matter at densities somewhere between @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 @xcite , depending on the in - medium properties of the h - dibaryon .",
    "h - matter could thus exist in the cores of moderately dense neutron stars . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out that h - dibaryons with a vacuum mass of about 2.2  gev and a moderately attractive potential in the medium of about @xmath33  mev could go into a bose condensate in the cores of neutron stars if the limiting star mass is about that of the hulse  taylor pulsar psr  1913 + 16 , @xmath34 .",
    "conversely , if the medium potential were moderately repulsive , say around @xmath35  mev , the formation of h - dibaryons may only take place in neutron stars heavier than @xmath36 .",
    "if formed , however , h - matter may not remain dormant in neutron stars but , because of its instability against compression could trigger the conversion of neutron stars into hypothetical strange stars @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested already back in the 1970 s by a number of researchers  @xcite that neutrons , protons plus the heavier constitutes ( @xmath37 ) can melt , creating the quark - gluon plasma state being sought at the most powerful terrestrial heavy - ion colliders at cern and rhic .",
    "( evidence for the creation of such matter in the framework of cern s lead beam program has been claimed earlier this year @xcite . ) at present one does not know from experiment at what density the expected phase transition to quark matter occurs , and one has no conclusive guide yet from lattice qcd simulations . from simple geometrical considerations",
    "it follows that nuclei begin to touch each other at densities of @xmath38 , which , for a characteristic nucleon radius of @xmath39  fm , is less than twice @xmath40 . above this density",
    ", therefore , one may expect that the nuclear boundaries of hadrons begin to dissolve and the formerly confined quarks populate free states outside of the hadrons .",
    "depending on rotational frequency and stellar mass , densities as large as two to three times @xmath40 are easily surpassed in the cores of neutron stars , so that the neutrons and protons in the centers of neutron stars may have been broken up into their constituent quarks by gravity @xcite .",
    "more than that , since the mass of the strange quark is only @xmath41  mev , high - energetic up and down quarks will readily transform to strange quarks at about the same density at which up and down quark deconfinement sets in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore three - flavor quark matter that could exist as a permanent component of matter in the centers of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "it is most fascinating that observational astrophysicists may be able to spot evidence for the existence of this novel phase of matter in the neutron star data , as we shall see next .",
    "whether or not quark deconfinement occurs in neutron stars makes only very little difference to their static properties , such as the range of possible masses and radii , which renders the detection of quark matter in such objects extremely complicated .",
    "this turns out to be strikingly different for rotating neutron stars ( i.e.  pulsars ) which develop quark matter cores in the course of spin - down .",
    "the reason being that as such stars spin down , because of the emission of magnetic dipole radiation and a wind of electron - positron pairs , they become more and more compressed . for",
    "some rotating neutron stars the    0.50 cm     mass and initial rotational frequency may be just such that the central density rises from below to above the critical density for dissolution of baryons into their quark constituents .",
    "this is accompanied by a sudden shrinkage of the neutron star , which , as calculated in @xcite , occurs at frequencies around 200  hz ( angular velocities @xmath42 ) .",
    "this effects the star s moment of inertia dramatically , as shown in figure  [ fig : ioab ] . depending on the ratio",
    "at which quark and normal matter change with frequency , the moment of inertia can decrease very anomalously , and could even introduce an era of stellar spin - up lasting for @xmath43 years @xcite . since the dipole age of millisecond pulsars is about @xmath44  years , we may roughly estimate that about 10% of the @xmath45 solitary millisecond pulsars presently known could be in the quark transition epoch and thus could be signaling the ongoing process of quark deconfinement !",
    "changes in the moment of inertia reflect themselves in the braking index , @xmath8 , of a rotating neutron star , as can be seen from @xmath46 @xmath47 the right - hand - side of this expression reduces to the well - known canonical constant @xmath48 only if @xmath49 is independent of frequency . evidently , this is not the case for rapidly rotating neutron stars , and it fails completely for stars that experience pronounced internal changes which alter the moment of inertia significantly .",
    "figure [ fig : nvso ] illustrates this for the neutron star of figure  [ fig : ioab ] . because of the changes in @xmath49 , driven by the transition into quark matter , the braking index deviates dramatically from 3 at the transition frequency , when pure quark matter is generated .",
    "such dramatic anomalies in @xmath50 are not known for conventional neutron stars , because their moments of inertia appear to vary smoothly with @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the future astrophysical observation of such anomalies in the braking behavior of pulsars may thus be interpreted as a signal for quark deconfinement in neutron stars ( `` quark astronomy '' ) .",
    "accreting x - ray neutron stars provide a very interesting contrast to the spin - down of isolated neutron stars .",
    "these x - ray neutron stars are being spun up by the accretion of matter from a lower - mass ( @xmath52 ) , less - dense companion .",
    "if the critical deconfinement density falls within that of the canonical pulsars , quark matter will already exist in them but will be `` spun out '' of x - ray stars as their frequency increases during accretion .",
    "this scenario has been modeled in @xcite , where it was found that quark matter remains relatively dormant in the core of a neutron star until the star has been spun up to frequencies at which the central density is about to drop below the threshold density at which quark matter exists .",
    "as known from above , this manifests itself in a significant increase of the star s moment of inertia .",
    "the angular momentum added to a neutron star during this phase of evolution is therefore consumed by the star s expansion , inhibiting a further spin - up until the quark matter has been converted into a mixed phase of matter made up of hadrons and quarks .",
    "such accreters , therefore , tend to spend a greater length of time in the critical frequencies than otherwise . there will be an anomalous number of accreters that appear at or near the same frequency .",
    "this is what was found recently with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "quark deconfinement constitutes a most natural explanation for this phenomenon , though alternative explanations are possible too @xcite .",
    "recently it was discovered that instantons may cause strong correlations between up and down quarks , which could give way to the existence of colored diquark pairs in superdense matter @xcite .",
    "these pairs would form a bose condensate in cold and dense quark matter .",
    "carrying color charges , the condensate ought to exhibit color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "both the magnitude of the gap and the critical temperature associated with the color superconductive phase were estimated to be on the order of @xmath53  mev @xcite .",
    "the implications of such tremendous gaps for the magnetic fields of pulsars and their thermal evolution were explored in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "color superconductivity may also be linked to the sudden irregularities observed in the rotational frequencies of some pulsars , known as glitches , as shown in the very recent study @xcite .",
    "so far we have assumed that quark matter forms a state of matter higher in energy than atomic nuclei .",
    "this most plausible assumption , however , may be quite deceiving @xcite because for a collection of more than a few hundred @xmath54 quarks , the energy per baryon ( @xmath55 ) of quark matter can be just as well below the energy of the most stable atomic nucleus , @xmath56 , whose energy per baryon number is @xmath57  mev , with @xmath58 the mass of the @xmath59fe atom .",
    "a simple estimate indicates that for strange quark matter @xmath60 , so that bag constants of @xmath61 ( i.e. @xmath62  mev ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64  mev ) place the energy per baryon of such matter at @xmath65  mev and 915  mev , respectively @xcite . obviously , these values correspond to quark matter which is absolutely bound with respect to @xmath59fe . in this event",
    "the ground state of the strong interaction would be    strange quark matter ( strange matter ) , made up of @xmath54 quarks , instead of nuclear matter .",
    "this finding is one of the most startling predictions of modern physics with far - reaching implications for neutron stars , for all hadronic stellar configurations in figure [ fig : cross ] would then be only metastable with respect to stars made up of absolutely stable 3-flavor strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , and if it is possible for neutron matter to tunnel to quark matter in at least some neutron stars , then in appears likely that all neutron stars would in fact be strange stars @xcite . in sharp contrast to the other stars in figure [ fig : cross ] , made up of hadronic matter , possibly in phase equilibrium with quarks , strange stars consist nearly entirely of pure 3-flavor quark matter , eventually enveloped in a thin nuclear crust",
    "whose density is always less than neutron drip density ( @xmath66 ) @xcite .",
    "the hypothetical , absolute stability of strange matter gives way to a variety of novel objects which stretch from strangelets at the small baryon number end , @xmath67 , to strange machos and strange dwarfs , to the compact strange stars at the high end , @xmath68 , where strange matter becomes unstable against gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "the strange counterparts of ordinary atomic nuclei are the strange nuggets , searched for in high - energy collisions at brookhaven ( e.g.  e858 , e864 , e878 , e882-b , e886 , e896-a ) , cern ( newmass experiment na52 ) , balloon - borne experiments ( crash ) , and terrestrial experiments ( e.g.  hadron ) @xcite .",
    "( for a recent review , see @xcite as well as this volume . )",
    "one of the most distinguishing features of the compact strange stars are their anomalously small radii which enables the whole branch of compact strange stars to withstand very rapid rotation , down to periods in the half - millisecond regime @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , only neutron stars very close to the limiting - mass value may be able to withstand such rapid rotation .",
    "an interesting candidate for a small - radius `` neutron '' star could be sax  j1808.4 - 3658 whose radius , as argued in @xcite , may be significantly smaller than the canonical neutron star radius of @xmath69  km ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "other distinguishing features originate from the fact that the surfaces of bare strange stars are made up of quark matter which allows for stellar luminosities as high as several @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the predominant cooling mechanism of hot ( temperatures of several @xmath71  k ) newly formed neutron stars immediately after formation is neutrino emission , with an initial cooling time scale of seconds .",
    "already a few minutes after birth , the internal neutron star temperature drops to @xmath72  k @xcite .",
    "photon emission overtakes neutrinos only when the internal temperature has fallen to @xmath43  k , with a corresponding surface temperature roughly two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "neutrino cooling dominates for at least the first @xmath73 years , and typically for much longer in standard cooling ( modified urca ) calculations .",
    "being sensitive to the adopted nuclear equation of state , the neutron star mass , the assumed magnetic field strength , the possible existence of superfluidity , meson condensates and quark matter , theoretical cooling calculations , as summarized in figure [ fig : cool ] , provide most valuable information about the interior matter and neutron star structure .",
    "the stellar cooling tracks in figure [ fig : cool ] are computed for a broad collection of equations of state  @xcite , including those shown in figure [ fig : eos ] . knowing the thermal evolution of a neutron star also yields information about such temperature - sensitive properties as transport coefficients , transition to superfluid states , crust solidification , and internal pulsar heating mechanisms such as frictional dissipation at the crust - superfluid interfaces @xcite ) .",
