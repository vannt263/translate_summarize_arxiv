    "in the last years many experimental results have pointed out the presence of strong electron - phonon ( @xmath0 ) coupling and polaronic effects in several compounds , such as high - temperature cuprate superconductors and colossal magnetoresistance manganites .",
    "@xcite this large amount of experimental data has renewed the interest in studying simplified @xmath0 coupled systems of the holstein @xcite or fr@xmath1hlich @xcite type and in proposing more realistic interaction models . @xcite",
    "the holstein molecular crystal model is the prototype for short - range ( @xmath2 ) @xmath0 interaction since it takes into account local coupling of a tight - binding electron to optical local phonon modes . till now an exact solution for this model has not been found and perturbative expansions are not able to describe the most interesting region characterized by intermediate @xmath0 couplings and electron and phonon energy scales not well separated . in this regime ,",
    "as shown by several numerical studies @xcite and variational approaches , @xcite the system undergoes a crossover from a weakly dressed electron to a massive localized polaronic quasiparticle , the small holstein polaron ( @xmath3 ) , with increasing the strength of interaction .",
    "all the ground state properties of the holstein moldel can be described with great accuracy by a variational approach @xcite based on a linear superposition of bloch states that describe weak and strong coupling polaron wave functions .",
    "indeed this method provides an immediate physical interpretation of the intermediate regime and is in excellent agreement with numerical results .",
    "recently a quite general @xmath0 lattice hamiltonian with a `` density - displacement '' type interaction has been introduced in order to understand the role of long - range ( @xmath4 ) coupling on the polaron formation .",
    "@xcite the model for a single particle is described by the hamiltonian @xmath5    @xmath6    the units are such that @xmath7 . in eq.([1r ] ) @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) denotes the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath10 , whose position vector is indicated by @xmath11 , and the symbol @xmath12 denotes nearest neighbours linked through the transfer integral @xmath13 .",
    "the operator @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) represents the creation ( annihilation ) operator for phonon on the site @xmath10 , @xmath16 is the frequency of the optical local phonon modes , @xmath17 controls the strength of @xmath0 coupling , and @xmath18 is the interacting force between an electron on the site @xmath10 and an ion displacement on the site @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 1r ] ) reduces to the holstein model if @xmath20 , while in general it contains @xmath4 interaction . in particular when one attempts to mimic the nonscreened coupling between doped holes and apical oxygen in some cuprates , @xcite the interaction force is given by @xmath21 if the distance @xmath22 is measured in units of lattice constant .",
    "considering the general @xmath0 matrix element @xmath23 @xmath24 with @xmath25 number of lattice sites , we can define the polaronic shift @xmath26 @xmath27 and the coupling constant @xmath28 , with @xmath29 lattice coordination number , that represents a natural measure of the strength of the @xmath0 interaction in both @xmath2 and @xmath4 case .",
    "clearly for @xmath4 interaction forces the matrix element @xmath23 is peaked around @xmath30 . since it has been claimed that the enhancement of the forward direction in the @xmath0 scattering could play a role in explaining several anomalous properties of cuprates as the linear temperature behaviour of the resistivity and the _ d_-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap , @xcite the study of lattice polaron features for @xmath4 interactions is important in order to clarify the role of the @xmath0 coupling in complex systems .    when the interaction force is given by eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) , the model has been investigated applying a path - integral monte - carlo ( @xmath31 ) algorithm @xcite efficient in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the first investigations have been mainly limited to the determination of the polaron effective mass pointing out that , due to the @xmath4 coupling , the polaron is much lighter than the @xmath3 with the same binding energy in the strong coupling regime .",
    "furthermore it has been found that this effect due to the weaker band renormalization becomes smaller in the antiadiabatic regime",
    ". then the quasi - particle properties have been studied by an exact lanczos diagonalization method @xcite on finite one - dimensional lattices ( up to 10 sites ) making a close comparison with the corresponding properties of @xmath32 . as a result of the @xmath4 interaction , the lattice deformation induced by the electron",
    "is spread over many lattice sites in the strong coupling region giving rise to the formation of a large polaron ( @xmath33 ) as in the weak coupling regime .",
    "all numerical and analytical results have been mainly obtained in the antiadiabatic and non - adiabatic regime .",
    "only recently the behavior of the effective mass of a two - site system @xcite in the adiabatic regime has been studied within the nearest - neighbor approximation for the @xmath0 interaction confirming that the @xmath33 is lighter than the @xmath3 at strong coupling .    in this paper",
    "we pursue the study of the ground state of the model with the interaction force given by eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we employ a variational approach previously proposed for the study of systems with @xmath0 local coupling @xcite and based on a linear superposition of bloch states that describe weak and strong coupling polaron wave functions .",
    "although the method is valid for any spatial dimension , we limit our study to the one - dimensional case .",
    "it has been found that the variational approach provides an estimate of the ground state energy in good agreement with @xmath31 results .",
    "the evolution of the ground - state spectral weight , the average kinetic energy , the mean number of phonons , and the electron - lattice correlation function with respect to the adiabaticity ratio @xmath34 and the @xmath0 coupling constant is discussed focusing on the adiabatic regime . indeed , in the adiabatic case , there is a range of values of the @xmath0 coupling where the ground state is well described by a particle with a weakly renormalized mass but a spectral weight much smaller than unity .",
    "furthermore , with increasing the strength of interaction in the same regime , the renormalized mass gradually increases , while the average kinetic energy is not strongly reduced .",
    "finally regions of the model parameters are distinguished according to the values assumed by the spectral weight .",
    "the resulting `` phase diagram '' @xcite shows strong mixing of electronic and phononic degrees of freedom for small values of the @xmath0 coupling constant in the adiabatic case .",
    "the variational approach is summarized following the lines of previous works .",
    "@xcite    we consider as trial wave functions translational invariant bloch states obtained by taking a superposition of localized states centered on different lattice sites : @xmath35 where @xmath36 } \\sum_m \\phi^{(i)}_{\\vec{k}}(\\vec{r}_m ) c^{\\dagger}_{m+n}|0 > .",
    "\\label{13rn}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ 12rn ] ) the apex @xmath37 indicates the weak and strong coupling polaron wave function , respectively , @xmath38 denotes the electron and phonon vacuum state , and @xmath39 are variational parameters defining the spatial broadening of the electronic wave function .",
    "the phonon distribution functions @xmath40 are chosen in order to reproduce the description of polaron features in the two asymptotic limits .",
    "@xcite therefore the weak coupling phonon distribution function @xmath41 is assumed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the free electron band energy , while the strong coupling phonon distribution function @xmath44 as @xmath45    a careful inspection of weak and strong coupling wave functions shows that in the intermediate regime they are not orthogonal and the off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian are not zero . hence the ground state energy is determined by considering as trial state a linear superposition of the weak and strong coupling wave functions : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 is the overlap factor of the two wave functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in eq.([31r ] ) @xmath52 and @xmath53 are two additional variational parameters which provide the relative weight of the weak and strong coupling solutions of the system for any particular value of @xmath54 .",
    "we perform the minimization procedure with respect to the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , assuming @xmath57 where the quantities @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 denote variational parameters , and the symbols @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 indicate , respectively , the nearest , the next - nearest neighbors and so on .",
    "this choice takes into account the broadening of the electron wave functions up to third neighbors and provides an accurate description of the polaron features for any value of the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "the ground state energies obtained with this choice are slightly higher than @xmath31 mean energies , being the difference less than @xmath65 in the worst case of intermediate regime .",
    "we note that these wave functions can be improved adding further terms in eq .",
    "( [ 170r ] ) , so it is possible to obtain better and better estimates of the energy .",
    "in this paper we study the properties of the ground - state in the one - dimensional case .    in fig .",
    "1(a ) we report the polaron ground state energy for different values of the adiabaticity ratio as a function of the @xmath0 constant coupling @xmath17 .",
    "we have checked that our variational proposal recovers the asymptotic perturbative results and improves significantly these asymptotic estimates in the intermediate region . moreover , our data for the ground - state energy in the intermediate region are in very good agreement with the results of the @xmath31 approach @xcite shown as diamonds in fig .",
    "the consistency of the results with a numerically more sophisticated approach indicates that the true wave function is very close to a superposition of weak and strong coupling states .",
    "another property of interest is the ground state spectral weight @xmath66 @xmath67 that gives the fraction of the bare electron state in the polaronic trial wave function .",
    "it measures how much the quasiparticle is different from the free electron ( @xmath68 ) , and a small value of @xmath66 indicates a strong mixing of electronic and phononic degrees of freedom . as plotted in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the increase of the @xmath0 coupling strength induces a decrease of the spectral weight that is smooth also in the adiabatic regime .",
    "the reduction of @xmath66 is closely related to the decrease of the drude weight obtained by exact diagonalizations @xcite pointing out a gradual suppression of coherent motion .",
    "we note that the behavior of @xmath66 is different from that of the local holstein model .",
    "in fact for the latter @xmath66 results to be very close to the ratio @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 bare electron and effective polaron mass , respectively , @xcite while for @xmath4 couplings @xmath72 in the intermediate to strong coupling adiabatic regime .",
    "this relation is confirmed by the results shown in fig.1 ( b ) , where the dash - dotted line and the squares on a similar line indicate the spectral weight @xmath66 and the ratio @xmath69 obtained within the variational approach , respectively , as a function of the coupling constant @xmath17 at @xmath73 .",
    "@xcite actually there is a large region of the parameters in the adiabatic regime where the ground state is well described by a particle with a weakly renormalized mass but a spectral weight @xmath66 much smaller than unity .",
    "while the electron drags the phonon cloud coherently through the lattice , with increasing the @xmath0 coupling in the adiabatic case , a band collapse occurs in the @xmath2 case , while the particle undergoes a weaker band renormalization in the case of @xmath4 interactions .",
    "therefore in the @xmath4 case the polaron results lighter than the @xmath3 in the intermediate to strong coupling adiabatic regime .",
    "insight about the electron state is obtained by calculating its kinetic energy @xmath74 in units of the bare one . since the average kinetic energy gives the total weight of the optical conductivity , @xmath74 includes both coherent and incoherent transport processes .",
    "@xcite as reported in fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "1(c ) , in the strong coupling adiabatic region before the electron is selftrapped ( @xmath75 ) , the average kinetic energy is weakly renormalized , the ratio @xmath69 is reduced and the spectral weight is nearly zero . furthermore , in figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) , within the adiabatic regime , the average kinetic energy and the mean number of phonons do not show any sharp change by increasing the @xmath0 coupling .",
    "another quantity associated to the polaron formation is the correlation function @xmath76 @xmath77 or equivalently the normalized correlation function @xmath78 , with @xmath79 . in fig .",
    "2(a ) we report the correlation function @xmath76 at @xmath80 for several values of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the lattice deformation is spread over many lattice sites giving rise to the formation of @xmath33 also in the strong coupling regime where really the correlation function assumes the largest values . in the inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) the normalized electron - lattice correlation function @xmath81 shows consistency with the corresponding quantity calculated in a previous work .",
    "@xcite while in the weak coupling regime the amplitude @xmath81 is smaller than the quantum lattice fluctuations , increasing the strength of the interaction , it becomes stronger and the lattice deformation is able to generate an attractive potential that can trap the charge carrier .",
    "clearly , even if the correlations between electron and lattice are large , the resulting polaron is delocalized over the lattice due to the translational invariance .",
    "finally the variation of the lattice deformation as a function of @xmath34 shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) can be understood as a retardation effect .",
    "in fact , for small @xmath34 , the less numerous phonons excited by the passage of the electron take a long time to relax , therefore the lattice deformation increases far away from the current position of the electron .    in fig .",
    "3 we propose a `` phase diagram '' based on the values assumed by the spectral weight in analogy with the holstein polaron .",
    "@xcite analyzing the behavior of @xmath66 it is possible to distinguish three different regimes : ( 1 ) quasi - free - electron regime ( @xmath82 ) where the electron has a weakly renormalized mass and the motion is coherent ; ( 2 ) crossover regime ( @xmath83 ) characterized by intermediate values of spectral weight and a mass not strongly enhanced ; ( 3 ) strong coupling regime ( @xmath84 ) where the spectral weight is negligible and the mass is large but not enormous .",
    "we note that for @xmath4 interactions in the adiabatic case there is strong mixing of electronic and phononic degrees of freedom for values of the coupling constant @xmath85 ( solid lines ) smaller than those characteristic of local holstein interaction ( dashed lines ) . furthermore in this case , entering the strong coupling regime , the charge carrier does not undergo any abrupt localization , on the contrary , as indicated also by the behavior of the average kinetic energy @xmath74 , it is quite mobile .    in order to study the effects of different @xmath0 interactions ,",
    "we have evaluated the average kinetic energy for both @xmath4 and @xmath2 cases . as reported in fig .",
    "4(a ) , in excellent agreement with a previous study , @xcite for @xmath4 interactions @xmath74 decreases very gradually with increasing @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , if the regime of parameters where the spectral weight @xmath86 is considered , as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , in the adiabatic case the average kinetic energy is larger for @xmath4 interactions ( solid line ) with respect to local holstein ones ( dashed line ) .",
    "the comparison emphasizes that due to @xmath4 interactions in the adiabatic regime @xmath74 is slightly renormalized even if the coherent motion is small .",
    "in this paper we have extended a previous variational approach in order to study the polaronic ground - state features of a one dimensional @xmath0 model with long - range interaction .",
    "the trial function is based on a linear superposition of bloch states that describe weak and strong coupling polaron wave functions and it provides an estimate of the ground state energy in good agreement with numerical methods .",
    "the results relative to spectral weight , the average kinetic energy , the mean number of phonons , and the electron - lattice correlation function have been discussed mainly in the adiabatic regime .",
    "it has been possible to identify a range of intermediate values of the @xmath0 coupling constant in the adiabatic case where the system is well described by a particle characterized with a weakly renormalized mass but a small spectral weight . in the same regime , further increasing the @xmath0 coupling , the renormalized mass shows a smooth increase , while the average kinetic energy is not strongly reduced .",
    "finally we have proposed a `` phase diagram '' according to the values assumed by the spectral weight .",
    "it is found that there is strong mixing between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom for small values of the @xmath0 coupling constant in the adiabatic case .",
    "the variational approach can be easily generalized to high dimensions , @xcite and it has been recently applied to study the three dimensional continuum fr@xmath87hlich model giving a very good description of ground state features .",
