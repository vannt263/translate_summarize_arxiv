    "gas metallicities are a particularly important diagnostic of galaxy evolution : at any given epoch , in any given galaxy population , they trace the amount of metals which have been produced and assembled by its previous stellar generations , as well as the metals which will be locked in its future generations of stars .",
    "efforts to determine the gas metallicity of star forming galaxies as a function of cosmic time have returned oxygen ( [ o / h ] ) gas metallicities for relatively large sample of galaxies up to @xmath8 and a handful above @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have relied on rest - frame optical lines , and in particular on the @xmath10\\,}{\\lambda\\,3727 } + { \\rm    [ o\\,iii]\\,}{\\lambda\\lambda\\,4959,5007})/ { \\rm h}{\\beta}$ ] metallicity indicator @xcite . while relatively easy to measure , @xmath11 is however degenerate with metallicity ( as low values of @xmath11 may correspond to very low or high metallicities ) , and affected by dust extinction .",
    "both problems are solved if the @xmath12 and @xmath13\\,}{\\lambda\\,6584}$ ] line fluxes are also available , since the @xmath14 line ratio provides an estimate for the dust extinction , and the @xmath15\\,}{\\lambda\\,6584}$]/@xmath12 line ratio breaks the degeneracy in @xmath16 .",
    "the reason for which most quoted studies have not used the @xmath17 and @xmath15\\,}{\\lambda\\,6584}$ ] lines is a practical one . for @xmath18 these two lines",
    "are shifted in the near - infrared ( nir ) , and are thus much more challenging to measure than the lines which appear within the optical window . nonetheless , these two lines turn out to be important to the study of galaxy properties at high - z . in paper iii",
    "we used vlt - isaac and keck - nirspec nir spectroscopy to measure @xmath17 and @xmath15\\,}{\\lambda\\,6584}$ ] emission line fluxes  and thus individual extinction values and reliable metallicities  for 30 @xmath19 galaxies extracted from the canada france redshift survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "we measured a large @xmath20mag scatter in extinction values for the cfrs galaxies , which demonstrated the importance of individual extinction corrections in order to avoid errors in the determination of star forming rates and metallicities of high @xmath21 galaxies .",
    "the next step is to extend a similar study of the star forming gas metallicity to galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "the rather unexplored @xmath0 redshift regime is one of particular importance in the history of the universe : there , the star formation and metal production rates for the universe as a whole , as measured by the the integrated luminosity density in the ultraviolet and far - infrared , appear to peak , i.e. , are a factor of about 6 higher relative to the local value ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , this is the redshift regime where the galaxy population clearly undergoes a transition in properties : it is beyond @xmath8 that luminous ultraviolet star - forming galaxies with `` unobscured '' star - formation rates ( sfrs ) @xmath22 m@xmath23yr@xmath24 , e.g. , galaxies with @xmath253727 } > 10^{42}$ ] erg s@xmath24 @xcite , appear in optically - selected galaxy samples .",
    "such galaxies are not detected below @xmath26 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     due to the paucity in observable windows of spectral diagnostics for galaxies in the @xmath0 redshift range , the gas metallicities ( and more generally the physical properties ) of @xmath0 galaxies",
    "are still mostly unconstrained .",
    "luckily , for the specific redshift @xmath27 , all five emission lines which are key to determine the gas metallicity and the extinction , i.e. , , , , , and [ nii ] , are all observable within several ( near - infrared ) atmospheric windows ( there is also another such window at @xmath28 ) . at the extreme redshift limit of ground - based optical surveys",
    "can be detected up to @xmath29 in the 9200  atmospheric window , e.g. in the cfrs survey .",
    "furthermore , other surveys have exploited explicitly the 9200  atmospheric window : the cadis survey ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other searches for @xmath30 lyman @xmath31 emitters @xcite have produced , as foreground interlopers , several -selected @xmath27 galaxies .",
    "the @xmath32 epoch lies roughly midway in cosmic time between the @xmath33 redshift range probed , e.g. , by the cadis @xcite and cfrs galaxies ( paperiii ) , and the @xmath34 epoch characterized by the lbgs ( for a handful of which oxygen abundances have been measured by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     in this paper we present oxygen gas abundances for a sample of five galaxies at @xmath27 selected by their emission .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we describe the vlt - isaac observations of our sample galaxies , and present the lower redshift samples that we use for comparison in our discussion . in sect .",
    "3 we present the derived emission line fluxes , metallicities and extinction values derived ( as in paperiii ) using a representation of the @xcite models . in sect .",
    "4 we present a grid of pgase2 chemical evolution models , and discuss those which are compatible with the observations .",
    "we then compare our metallicity measurements at @xmath2 with similar measurements at other redshifts , and with the pgase2 models , and discuss the picture for the chemical evolution of galaxies that emerges from our study . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we present our conclusions .",
    "a _ concordance_-cosmology with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is used throughout this paper .",
    "our measurements of [ o / h ] do not depend on the solar [ o / h ] .",
    "however , when linking the oxygen abundance with the metallicity calculated in pgase2 models we use the solar value @xmath38 from @xcite . note that _ metallicity _ and _ abundance _ will be taken to denote _ oxygen abundance _ throughout this paper , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the sample galaxies were selected as - emitters at @xmath32 from three sources : the cadis survey ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cfrs survey @xcite , and from unpublished analysis of cfht emission line searches in the cfrs 22h field @xcite .",
    "the lines of the cadis galaxies were measured using a fabry - perot interferometer at about 9200 ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cfht survey was undertaken combining multiple parallel long slits with a narrowband filter to search for @xmath39 lyman @xmath31 emitters in the 9200  atmospheric window ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these cfht -selected galaxies are located in the cfrs 22h field @xcite .",
    "the total sample of @xmath27 galaxies contains five objects , two from the cadis , one from the cfrs survey , and two from the cfht multislit@xmath40narrowband filter survey . for all galaxies we obtained vlt - isaac spectra in the j band , to measure the and fluxes , and in the h - band , to measure and ( upper limits to the ) [ nii ] fluxes .",
    "we also acquired h- and j - band imaging in order to test the relative calibration of the emission line fluxes , as described in paperiii .",
    "fragmentary near - infrared spectroscopy data were obtained for three additional objects , and we will report these elsewhere if we made up the remaining flux measurements .",
    "the observations were carried out at the vlt in visitor mode in october 2004 ( program 074.b-0122a ) using a slit of 2 width and 120 length . the spectra cover a range of 79 nm in the h band , and 59 nm in the j band .",
    "the individual integration times and the standard stars used for the flux calibration are given in table [ obsisaacz14 ] .",
    "the data reduction was done using iraf as described in detail in paperiii for similar isaac spectroscopic observations of cfrs galaxies at medium redshift .",
    "the resulting spectra of the five @xmath2 galaxies are shown in figure[spectra1d ] .",
    "for easy reference we use throughout this paper the galaxy identification codes adopted in the previous quoted literature .     in the good seeing conditions for the isaac observations ( see table  [ obsisaacz14 ] ) , the 2 isaac slit approximates a total flux measurement .",
    "it is well matched to the 1.75 width of the cfrs observations for cfrs-221153 @xcite and to the 2 width of the slit used for the observations of ltbc-18a and ltbc-18b @xcite .",
    "the measurements for the two cadis objects were made with an imaging fabry - perot interferometer ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and thus the measured flux should be  total \" . in paperiii we were able to check directly the relative flux calibration of optical and near - infrared spectra , under similar observational set - ups , and concluded that there was no evidence of problems .",
    "one possible concern with the present data is that the slits used by @xcite may not have been accurately centered on the two ltbc objects , conceivably leading to an underestimate of the flux for these particular objects .",
    "however , these two objects have similar emission line ratios to the other @xmath32 galaxies and slit mis - centering is not believed to be a problem .      in this paper",
    "we compare our new @xmath2 metallicities data with the properties of 30 cfrs galaxies at @xmath19 from paperiii , and with 17 lower luminous @xmath3 cadis galaxies from @xcite .",
    "although only few of the @xmath3 cadis galaxies have five emission lines observed , @xcite showed that it is likely that all 17 cadis galaxies have low extinction , so we used the case b intensity ratio of to of 2.86 when running our program to determine metallicities based on the kd02 models .",
    "as nearby comparison samples we adopted , as in paperiii , 70 @xmath41 kiss galaxies of @xcite , and 108 nfgs @xmath42 galaxies of @xcite , with all , , , , and [ nii ] line fluxes measured .     after careful analysis , we opted for _ not _ using , in our analysis of the metallicities , the following samples of galaxies with published oxygen metallicities : the 64 @xmath43 galaxies of @xcite , the 177 @xmath44 galaxies of @xcite , the 25 @xmath45 galaxies of @xcite , and the 7 galaxies at @xmath46 of @xcite .",
    "in fact , from all these samples , only a handful of low redshift ( typically @xmath47 ) objects had and measurements , which are important to break the 23 degeneracy with metallicity . in detail , 9/66 galaxies at @xmath43 with measured equivalent widths from @xcite",
    "have measured / ( all at @xmath48 ) ; 32/177 galaxies at @xmath44 with measured equivalent widths from @xcite have measured / ( all at @xmath49 ) ; and 4/25 galaxies at @xmath45 from @xcite have / measured .",
    "furthermore , several of the mentioned studies performed no dust extinction correction .",
    "this , as we showed in paperiii , can significantly affect the analysis .",
    "finally , the @xmath46 galaxies of @xcite had oxygen abundances determined using only the / ratio ; these , as already discussed by @xcite and in paperiii , are on their own rather uncertain ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we do not think that excluding these samples from our discussion would significantly change our conclusions .",
    "moreover , as discussed below , using the cadis and cfrs comparison samples has several advantages .",
    "the choice of the cadis and cfrs samples for comparison with our new set of metallicities for galaxies at @xmath2 has two main advantages :     i ) as stressed by @xcite , the details of any specific calibration of line fluxes and ratios into metallicity has a significant impact on the metallicity measurements and the resulting luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "it is thus important that , when comparing different samples of galaxies , identical methods and calibrations are adopted for all samples ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for all the galaxies of the adopted comparison samples we had access to the emission line fluxes measurements and derived [ o / h ] metallicities using the same approach that we used for calculating the metallicities of the @xmath2 galaxies ( see section [ ohsfrsav ] , and paperiii for details on the method ) .",
    "ii ) another important requirement for performing a proper comparison of the metallicity - luminosity relation between low- and high - z samples of galaxies is the availability of properly derived rest - frame luminosities for the distant galaxies .",
    "as also stressed by @xcite , one should fit the full seds over a large wavelength range in order to obtain reliable rest - frame luminosities for the @xmath50 galaxies .",
    "we have available multi - wavelength imaging for the @xmath2 galaxies presented in this paper , as well as for the cfrs galaxies of paperiii ( see table1 of paperiii ) , and the cadis objects where 16 filters were used to derive the sed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "reliable rest - frame luminosities could therefore be obtained for all the galaxies in these samples .",
    "the cadis and cfrs galaxies at @xmath51 have different selection criteria , but , excluding a few objects , we can get a useful comparison sample , as shown in the following .",
    "the cfrs galaxies are selected to have @xmath52 , and a rest frame equivalent width of , @xmath53 , larger than 8 , as described in paperii .",
    "on the other hand , the cadis galaxies were selected based on their emission detected using a fabry - perot - interferometer ( @xmath54 ) , regardless of their continuum brightness .",
    "thus , cadis can detect lower luminosity galaxies at a given @xmath21 .",
    "fig.[ewmb ] shows the distribution of ews at restframe wavelength of @xmath2 , cadis and cfrs galaxies as a function of blue absolute magnitude .",
    "the distribution of ews of the cadis galaxies is broadly consistent with the ew distribution of cfrs and @xmath2 galaxies ( and this holds also for the larger cadis sample as shown in fig.4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except for three cadis objects at @xmath55 ( open circles ) which have a particular high ew .",
    "these are the only galaxies without vlt spectroscopic follow - up reported by @xcite , galaxies with high enough fluxes that their oxygen abundance could be obtained using spectroscopy with the 3.6-m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) .",
    "we will exclude these three objects from the cadis comparison sample in the following .     summarizing the above , despite the different selection criteria , the @xmath56 @xmath2 galaxies , the @xmath57 cfrs , and the @xmath58 cadis sample follow a similar ew-@xmath59 distribution ( after excluding the three objects mentioned above ) suggesting that they are not completely different species and that the cadis+cfrs sample is a useful comparison sample for the @xmath32 galaxies .",
    "it is not perfect , but it is the best we can do at the present time .",
    "the cadis objects were [ oiii ] selected , whereas the cfrs is effectively selected ( see paperii ) .",
    "it should be appreciated that cadis will be slightly biased towards high [ oiii]/[oii ] ( and low [ o / h ] ) , inferred from the fact that there is a correlation within the cfrs sample between @xmath60}$ ] and [ oiii]/[oii ] , and @xmath60}$ ] and [ o / h ] .",
    "there is no such correlation with @xmath25}$ ] , indicating that there should not be similar biases in the @xmath2 selected sample .",
    "emission line fluxes were measured from the calibrated spectra following the procedure described in paperiii .",
    "table [ vltisaacz14 ] reports , for each individual galaxy , the emission line fluxes ( or upper limits ) of the five observed galaxies . specifically :     _ ( i ) _ the line was too faint to be detected .",
    "however , we could determine upper limits to the flux for all five @xmath2 galaxies , which are good enough to check for contamination by agns and to break the degeneracy of the 23 relation .",
    "table [ vltisaacz14 ] lists the @xmath61 upper limits .     _",
    "( ii ) _ for four of the @xmath2 galaxies we were able to measure fluxes for all three lines of , , and .",
    "the fluxes and flux errors were measured as described in paperiii .",
    "we have not applied any corection for stellar absorption to the line , because this line has an observed equivalent width larger than 50 for the four @xmath2 galaxies .",
    "like in paperiii , we assumed a minimum 10% for the uncertainties of the measured fluxes when computing oxygen abundances using the kd02 models ( see table[vltisaacz14 ] ) .     _",
    "( iii ) _ for the galaxy cadis-01h-11134 the line coincides with a strong oh line , so we were not able to measure the line flux .",
    "however , we could measure , , , and an upper limit for for this galaxy .",
    "we calculated the flux for the galaxy cadis-01h11134 using case b recombination and assuming a low @xmath62 ( similar to the extinction values found for the other four @xmath2 galaxies ) , and we used this value when calculating the oxygen abundance of this galaxy using the models of kd02 ( see section[ohsfrsav ] ) .",
    "this results in a value of @xmath63 , which is completely consistent with the input value .",
    "this makes the point that @xmath64 is not solely determined by / , but also has a small contribution from the other line ratios .",
    "the approach described in paperiii was used to derive [ o / h ] and the extinction values @xmath65 for the five @xmath2 galaxies .",
    "briefly , the approach is based on the models of kd02 , who developed a set of ionisation parameter and oxygen abundance diagnostics based on the use of strong rest - frame optical emission lines .",
    "the method consists in performing a simultaneous fit to all available emission line fluxes ( including the upper limits ) in terms of extinction parameter @xmath64 , ionisation parameter @xmath6 , and [ o / h ] .     as in paperiii , before proceeding with determining gas metallicities , we checked that the detected line emission is not strongly contaminated by the presence of an agn . to this purpose",
    "we used the log(/ ) vs. log(/ ) diagnostic diagram shown in fig.[diagnagn ] .",
    "the location on this diagram of the five @xmath2 galaxies is indicated with arrows , given that we only had upper limits for the [ nii ] fluxes .",
    "the five galaxies lie under and to the left of the theoretical curve of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* solid line ) , which separates star forming galaxies ( below / left of the curve ) from agns ( above / right of the curve ) . in none of the five @xmath2 galaxies the line emission",
    "is therefore dominated by an agn .",
    "the gas metallicities we then derived for the @xmath2 galaxies are rather low compared to lower redshift galaxies of similar luminosities , and also their derived extinction values are quite low .",
    "we will discuss this finding in the following sect.[discuss ] .",
    "the luminosities ( corrected for extinction ) were used to calculate the sfrs of the five @xmath2 galaxies using the @xcite conversion of h@xmath31 luminosity into @xmath66 : @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting sfrs are given in table [ vltisaacz14 ] .",
    "note that alternative ( but less probable ) oxygen abundance solutions are found for two @xmath2 galaxies , and we will indicate them as open squares wherever [ o / h ] is plotted .",
    "these alternative ( but less probable ) oxygen abundances found using the method described in section 3.3 of paperiii are [ o / h]=@xmath68 for object ltbc-18a , and [ o / h]=@xmath69 for object cadis-23h-3487 .",
    "our basic observational result is that the spectra of the @xmath32 galaxies , which have @xmath70 have the line ratios and derived parameters ( metallicity , extinction , ionisation parameter ) that are found in much lower luminosity galaxies at lower redshifts .",
    "specifically , they are similar to what is found in the @xmath3 cadis galaxies ( @xmath71 ) , and noticably different from the general properties of the more luminous ( @xmath72 ) cfrs galaxies at @xmath19 ( see paperiii ) .",
    "we look first at the simple line ratios .",
    "[ diagnoiiioii ] shows the location of the five @xmath73 galaxies on the diagnostic diagram / ( extinction corrected ) vs. /.",
    "the lower luminosity @xmath3 cadis galaxies , the brighter @xmath19 cfrs galaxies , and the more luminous @xmath4 lbgs are also plotted for comparison . in contrast with the bright , intermediate - z cfrs galaxies , which show low / and / ratios , it should be noted that all the @xmath2 galaxies have the high / and / line ratios which are typical of the lower luminosity intermediate-@xmath21 cadis galaxies and of the more luminous lbgs at higher @xmath21 . in other words ,",
    "the appearance of high / ratios moves to brighter luminosities at higher @xmath21 .    to illustrate this further , fig .",
    "[ oiiioiimb ] shows the line ratios / vs. @xmath59 for the five @xmath27 galaxies , the cadis and cfrs sample , the lbgs , and the local kiss and nfgs galaxies .",
    "it is clear that there is a relation between / and @xmath59 for local kiss galaxies , in the sense that lower luminosity galaxies tend to have higher / ratios . at higher redshifts ,",
    "a similar trend is seen for the combined sample of cadis and cfrs galaxies at @xmath74 , with the relation displaced upwards and to the right , i.e. to higher / ratios at a given luminosity or higher luminosities at a given line ratio .",
    "the @xmath2 and lbg galaxies at @xmath75 continue this trend , uniformly exhibiting the high / ratios ( i.e. above one ) .",
    "while the / distribution of the selected cadis objects may be biased ( see section [ selef ] ) , the @xmath32 galaxies were -selected and there is no observational selection against low / ratios .",
    "the tracks of individual galaxies in this diagram are likely to be diagonal , moving down to lower / with modest fading . within the population , the evolutionary trend is in the sense that , as we look back in time , galaxies of similar luminosities as local galaxies show increasingly higher / ratios .",
    "we do not know at this point about the spectra of low luminosity galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "it can be nevertheless seen that a given type of spectrum ( high / ) is found almost exclusively below a luminosity threshold which is low at zero redshift ( @xmath76 ) , increases to @xmath77 at @xmath78 , and has evidently increased to above @xmath79 at @xmath32 .",
    "one may interpret these basic trends seen in our data within a `` downsizing '' picture \" @xcite .    ",
    "down - sizing  as originally introduced by @xcite defined `` forming galaxies '' as those in which the timescale of formation m@xmath80/sfr was less than the hubble time at the redshift in question .",
    "@xcite then showed that there existed a threshold in mass below which forming galaxies were found and above which they were not found .",
    "`` down - sizing '' then referred to the observational fact that this mass threshold decreases ( in mass ) with cosmic time .",
    "this concept has since been generalised to any situation in which signatures of `` youthfulness '' ( e.g. irregular morphologies , blue colours , high equivalent width emission lines , and , as earlier argued in paperii , low [ o / h ] ) exhibit a similar mass ( or more loosely luminosity ) threshold which decreases with epoch .",
    "high / ratios arise from a high ionisation parameter @xmath6 and/or low metallicities , as shown , e.g. , in kd02 , their fig.1 .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig.[oh_logq ] , which shows the oxygen abundance as a function of ionisation parameter for the @xmath81 galaxies .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath32 galaxies overlap in @xmath6 and [ o / h ] the cadis objects , and avoid the area defined by the more luminous cfrs galaxies with lower @xmath6 and higher [ o / h ] . in the next sections ,",
    "we explore more directly the implied metallicities of the galaxies in our different samples .       to quantify our results for the chemical evolution of galaxies with cosmic time , we have constructed a grid of chemical evolution models using pgase2 @xcite .",
    "pgase2 is a user - friendly galaxy evolution code that computes galaxy properties as a function of galaxy age , starting from the properties of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) , i.e. populations of stars formed simultaneously with the same metallicity .",
    "metallicities between 0.005 and 5 times solar are implemented in the code .",
    "the input parameters for pgase2 are :    _ ( i ) _",
    "@xmath82 , i.e. , the shape of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we adopted a salpeter imf , with @xmath83 between 0.1 and 120 @xmath84 .    _",

    "@xmath87 , i.e. , the timescale on which the galaxy is assembled .",
    "the model assumes that galaxies are built by continuous infall of primordial ( zero metallicity ) gas with an infall rate that declines exponentially as :    @xmath88    the total mass of the galaxy at a given time @xmath89 is then given by :    @xmath90    _ ( v ) _",
    "@xmath91 , i.e. , the functional form of the star formation rate .",

    "the mass of the gas in the model galaxy at a time @xmath89 , @xmath95 , is equal @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the mass locked up into stars at the time @xmath89 .",

    "it is assumed that there is a reservoir of primordial gas that feeds the `` galaxy '' .",
    "the galaxy forms stars with a rate @xmath100 , and we follow the evolution of the model galaxy in the luminosity - metallicity diagram as a function of time .",
    "the model galaxy is treated as a single zone with uniform chemical composition and without outflow .",
    "this oversimplification is appropriate to get a basic understanding of how fundamental parameters , such as sfr and gas supply , roughly affect galaxy properties such as luminosity and metallicity .",
    "we stress that we do not assign any particular physical significance to these models , but simply use them as means to explore reasonable possibilities . by varying the parameters we can get an understanding of how different evolutionary histories are represented in the [ o / h]-@xmath101 plane .",

    "the following should be noted :    _ ( i ) _ models with short @xmath87 and @xmath104 in fig.[mb_ohpegas ] ( e.g. , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) are models in which the mass of gas in the reservoir of gas is transferred to the galaxy in a short time , after which the gas infall practically stops , resulting in gas rich galaxies at early times .",

    "( ii ) _ increasing @xmath87 ( but still keeping @xmath107 , e.g. , @xmath108 and @xmath106 ) results in models in which the galaxy reaches a high metallicity at early times .",
    "ultimately , models with @xmath109 reach their end metallicity after @xmath110gyr , and afterwards their metallicity remains approximately constant while the luminosity decreases .",
    "this results in an almost horizontal evolution in the luminosity - metallicity diagram with [ o / h ] effectively constant over a long period of time .    _",
    "( iii ) _ varying @xmath86 results in an horizontal shift of the models as shown in fig.[mb_ohpegas ] for two typical masses ( @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ) .",

    "if galaxies started at very high @xmath21 they get in the region of the metallicity - luminosity relation today after about 13gyrs .",
    "but they could get there at younger ages if they started their evolution well after the big bang ( see below ) .",
    "the existence of relatively high luminosity galaxies with relatively low metallicities implies that the horizontal `` constant - metallicities '' models described in ( ii ) are unlikely .",
    "these galaxies would have to fade too much following the horizontal models ( ii ) to reach the local metallicity - luminosity relation : e.g. , in paperii in sections 4.1 and 4.2 it was discussed that it is unlikely that cfrs galaxies can fade by more than 2.5mag to the present epoch .",
    "thus , a key point seen in fig.[mb_ohpegas ] is that galaxies which are observed far from the local luminosity - metallicity relation ( i.e. , with much lower metallicities ) need to have young ages ( i.e. , be near the start of their evolutionary track ) and to follow a `` closed - box''-like model ( see ( i ) above ) in order to reach the region of the luminosity - metallicity relation of galaxies today , by moving vertically or diagonally and not horizontally , because they need a substantial increase in [ o / h ] .     in the following ,",
    "we adopt a representative set of pgase2 models to discuss the chemical evolution of galaxies from @xmath2 to today .",
    "specifically , we will use models with fixed @xmath106gyrs and @xmath105gyr , and different @xmath86 and @xmath103 .",
    "these models are highlighted in fig.[mb_ohpegas ] by gray / red lines and filled symbols , and reported in fig.[mb_ohcode ] .",
    "the selected models have a range of parameters from @xmath111 , @xmath113 ( right in fig.[mb_ohcode ] ) , to @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( left ) .",
    "we are not so much interested in precise quantitative arguments , but rather in understanding the qualitative behaviour . given the global model properties discussed above , the specific choice of models in figs.[mb_ohcode ] and [ mb_ohcodecadis ] should not affect the general conclusions we draw below .       in order to discuss the evolution of the metal abundance of the star forming gas in galaxies from @xmath116 to @xmath29",
    ", we compare the pgase2 models discussed above with the observed luminosities and metallicities of the five @xmath2 galaxies in fig.[mb_ohcode ] .",
    "included in the figure are also the intermediate redshift cfrs galaxies , and the location of local kiss and nfgs galaxies listed in section [ compsampl ] .",
    "it is quite noticeable that there is an age - redshift relation along a given pgase2 track .",
    "for example , despite the large scatter , the bright , @xmath57 , @xmath2 galaxies ( black filled squares ) appear to be `` younger '' than @xmath117 galaxies ( red filled squares ) in the sense that they lie towards the beginning of the luminosity - metallicity track .",
    "the latter appear in turn to be on average `` younger '' than most @xmath118 galaxies ( green filled squares ) which themselves actually overlap significantly on the diagram with the metallicity - luminosity relation traced by nearby galaxies .",
    "the tracks of the pgase2 models suggest that the bright star forming @xmath2 galaxies are likely to evolve into the population of less luminous but nonetheless rather massive , metal - rich galaxies that appear in the @xmath119 galaxy population .",
    "the observation of this age - redshift effect is not surprising , and indeed is reassuring !",
    "subsequent evolution along the pgase2 model tracks allows us to speculate about what are specifically the @xmath116 descendants of the intermediate-@xmath21 galaxies that we are studying . on the [ o / h ] vs. @xmath59 plane at redshift zero these appear to be massive disk galaxies .",
    "the observed @xmath120-band hst morphologies of our @xmath121 galaxies cover a wide range , with some galaxies having a very compact appearance , and others being extended objects , including regular disks ( see paperii ) .",
    "these morphologies are expected to describe well the distribution of the star forming gas , as they picture the @xmath122 galaxies in approximately the rest - frame @xmath123-band , where recent star formation dominates the light emission .",
    "we therefore suspect that the metal - enriched reservoirs of star forming gas that we are studying in this paper are being mostly consumed to build up both the disk and the bulge components of spiral galaxies .",
    "this interpretation is in agreement with other studies which argue for a substantial build up of stellar mass in disks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bulges ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at intermediate epochs .",
    "adding the low luminosity cadis galaxies from @xcite to the metallicity - luminosity diagram ( fig.[mb_ohcodecadis ] ) , we note an interesting fact : the rate of evolution of galaxies along their tracks appears to depend on luminosity ( mass ) .",
    "what we mean by this is as follows : at the lookback time of about 6gyrs ( @xmath124 ) at which a significant fraction of more massive @xmath125 galaxies are still close to the zero redshift metallicity - luminosity relation , the lower luminosity ( lower mass ) objects at @xmath126 sampled by cadis are already quite far from the local metallicity - luminosity .",
    "moreover , the metallicity - luminosity relation of the combined cadis+cfrs @xmath3 sample ( green solid line ) shows a change in slope compared to the local metallicity - luminosity relation , in the sense that the offset in metallicity between @xmath127 and @xmath3 is larger at lower luminosity than at higher luminosity .",
    "this may be due to the fact that lower luminosity ( mass ) galaxies began their most rapid evolution later than high luminosity ( mass ) galaxies , as also suggested by the pgase2 models ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as we look back further in time , we find signs for departures from the @xmath116 metallicity - luminosity relation occuring at progessively higher luminosities ( or masses ) .",
    "it is important to address possible selection effects in figs.[mb_ohcode ] and [ mb_ohcodecadis ] .",
    "in particular , there is no observational reason why the @xmath2 galaxies could not have had [ o / h ] @xmath128 , nor why the most luminous cfrs objects could not have had [ o / h ] @xmath129 .",
    "as noted earlier , the cadis sample may be somewhat biased towards lower [ o / h ] by the [ oiii ] selection .    to further clarify the effects seen in fig.[mb_ohcodecadis ]",
    ", one can see that there are ( broadly speaking ) the signatures of the `` downsizing '' effect described in section [ basicobs ] in the sense that : ( a ) at @xmath130 ( green symbols ) nearly all galaxies with @xmath131 are fairly close to the low - z [ o / h]-@xmath101 relation ( there being one obvious exception ) ; ( b ) at @xmath132 , this is true only for @xmath133 ; and ( c ) at @xmath32 even the most luminous galaxies are evolved off of the low redshift [ o / h]-@xmath59 relation .",
    "however , it should be noted that the samples of galaxies at @xmath119 and @xmath32 and the range in luminosities ( particularly for @xmath134 ) are both quite small and somewhat heterogeneously selected .",
    "therefore , additional measurements of metallicities at @xmath135 of larger samples of galaxies are required to establish a change of the slope of the metalicity - luminosity relation at these redshifts , as indicated by the analysis of the metallicity - luminosity relation of our rather small sample",
    ". this could provide more direct evidence for a `` downsizing '' scenario .",
    "the metallicity of the star forming gas has been measured for five galaxies at @xmath32 using new near - infrared vlt - isaac spectroscopy in the h- and j - band , and already available measurements of the emission line flux of the line , by which the galaxies were selected .",
    "using the measurements of , , , , and upper limits for it was possible to determine the extinction , oxygen abundances , and extinction corrected star forming rates for these luminous ( @xmath56 ) galaxies . the comparison between pgase2 chemical evolution models , and the observed properties of galaxies at @xmath2 , cfrs galaxies at @xmath119 , lower luminosity cadis galaxies at @xmath3 , and more luminous lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath136 , lead us to the following conclusions :      \\2 .",
    "all the @xmath2 galaxies have the high / and / line ratios which are typical of the lower luminosity intermediate-@xmath21 cadis galaxies ( although it should be noted that cadis is [ oiii]-selected and may be slightly biased towards high [ oiii]/[oii ] ) and of the more luminous lbgs at higher @xmath21 .",
    "this is in contrast with the bright , intermediate-@xmath21 cfrs galaxies , which show low / and / ratios .",
    "the basic trends in our data are consistent with a `` downsizing '' picture in the sense that a given type of spectrum ( high / ) is found almost exclusively below a luminosity threshold which is low at zero redshift ( @xmath76 ) , increases to @xmath77 at @xmath78 , and has evidently increased to above @xmath79 at @xmath32 .",
    "analysis of a set of pgase2 models has shown that galaxies which are observed far from the local luminosity - metallicity relation ( i.e. , with much lower metallicities ) need to have young ages ( i.e. , be near the start of their evolutionary track ) and to follow a roughly `` closed - box''-like model to reach the region of the luminosity - metallicity relation of galaxies today .    \\4 . there is an age - redshift relation along a given pgase2 track .",
    "the bright , @xmath57 , @xmath2 galaxies appear to be `` younger '' than @xmath117 galaxies , and the latter appear in turn to be on average `` younger '' than most @xmath118 galaxies .",
    "the tracks of the pgase2 models suggest that the bright star forming @xmath2 galaxies are likely to evolve into the population of relatively less luminous but nonetheless rather massive , metal - rich galaxies that appear in the @xmath119 galaxy population .",
    "interestingly , the rate of evolution of a galaxy along its track appears to depend on luminosity ( mass ) .",
    "as we look back in time , we find indications for departures from the local metallicity - luminosity relation occuring at progessively higher luminosities ( or masses ) .",
    "this provides further support for a `` downsizing '' picture of galaxy formation , at least from @xmath2 to today .",
