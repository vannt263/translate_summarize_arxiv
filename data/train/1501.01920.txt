    "the optical properties of quantum emitters ( qes ) , such as quantum dots and fluorescent dyes , near metal nanoparticles ( nps ) are a topic of great interest both from the point of view of a fundamental understanding of these properties,@xcite as well as the technological applications that they can lead to , e.g.  solar cells,@xcite light - emitting diodes,@xcite subwavelength imaging,@xcite micro - lasers,@xcite single photon sources,@xcite etc .    of particular importance",
    "is the influence that the _ localized surface plasmon _ ( lsp ) excited at the surface of the metal nanoparticles@xcite has on the optical properties of quantum emitters .",
    "the influence of the lsp on the non - radiative decay rates of quantum emitters placed close to a single metal sphere has been extensively studied , both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite different models have been proposed for the mechanism of the energy transfer process between the quantum emitter and the metal np , such as the _ nanometal surface energy transfer _ ( nset ) model,@xcite which considers the sphere as an infinite surface and has a distance dependence of the form @xmath1 , and the _ frster resonance energy transfer _ ( fret ) model , which considers the sphere a polarizable dipole , and has a distance dependence of the form @xmath0.@xcite recent theoretical work has shown that the distance dependence is more complex , and the nset and fret models are only valid in certain distance regimes.@xcite    the metal np is an extended object and therefore has to be modeled in a full quantum electrodynamic formalism .",
    "when such a formalism is employed , the distance dependence of the non - radiative decay rate of the qe becomes more complex , including @xmath0 , @xmath2 , as well as other contributions , in agreement with previous theoretical work.@xcite in addition to the distance dependence , we investigate the effect of the emission wavelength and quantum yield , as well as the size of the metal np on the energy transfer rate between the qe and the metal np .    of perhaps even more importance",
    "is the process of excitation energy transfer in a donor - acceptor pair , one of the main pathways by which energy transfer occurs at the nanoscale .",
    "it plays important roles in biology,@xcite nanophotonics ( leds , nanolasers ) , microscopy,@xcite sensing,@xcite and as optical rulers,@xcite etc .",
    "the process is determined by the dipole - dipole interaction between the donor and acceptor and , in the short distance limit , has a @xmath0 dependence on the donor - acceptor separation @xmath3 , the above - mentioned fret regime.@xcite    the fret regime is known to hold for donor - acceptor separations smaller than approximately @xmath4 ; for separations larger than this , the energy transfer process is overwhelmed by other de - excitation mechanisms of the donor , such as phonon relaxation or emission into the far - field . in a variety of applications , it is desirable to extend the fret regime to larger donor - acceptor separations .",
    "this would enhance the efficiency of light - harvesting@xcite and emitting systems,@xcite as well as increase the range and accuracy of sensing devices @xcite and optical rulers.@xcite    one possible way of enhancing the energy transfer rate in a donor - acceptor pair is by introducing a `` mediator '' .",
    "the role of the mediator is to increase the probability that energy transfer between donor and acceptor will occur .",
    "one such mediator is a metal nanoparticle which can support lsps , whose main characteristics are both a large confinement and a large enhancement of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the field of a lsp can thus provide a good mediator for the energy transfer process between donor and acceptor , when these are suitably positioned around the nanoparticle .",
    "the field of the lsp on the metal nanoparticle influences not only the energy transfer rate between donor and acceptor , but also the other channels which contribute to the total decay rate of the donor and introduce new ones , such as absorption of energy by the metal .",
    "it is therefore important to enhance not only the energy transfer rate , but in particular the energy transfer efficiency , which is a measure of the competition between the donor - acceptor energy transfer rate and all other decay channels of the donor .    in this contribution",

    "this is most clear for the smaller np , with a radius @xmath74 nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig:03a ] ) , but it is visible for the larger ones as well ( fig .  [ fig:03b ] ) , over a smaller range .",
    "given that the @xmath75-axis is logarithmic , this range is still quite large . as the radius of the au np",
    "is increased , however , the @xmath0 distance dependence regime becomes less dominant until it completely disappears for panel [ fig:03f ] in the figure , for which the radius of the au np is 20 nm .",
    "one can , therefore , infer a fret - type mechanism for the energy transfer rate from the emitter to the au np , when the distance of the emitter to the surface of the au np is larger than the diameter of the np .",
    "the energy transfer rate deviates from a simple dipole pair fret model when the emitter - au np surface separation is smaller than the diameter of the au np , in which case the higher multipole orders in the electromagnetic response of the np have a non - negligible contribution to the et rate and the np can no longer be accurately approximated as a point dipole .",

    "for this investigation , however , we will not consider the distance of the quantum emitter to the center of the au np , @xmath51 , but to its surface , denoted @xmath77 .",

    "additionally for each panel , we have also calculated this dependence for several emission wavelengths of the quantum emitter , @xmath81 400 nm , 450 nm , 500 nm , and 550 nm , spanning the lsp range . the log - log scale in fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] shows that the dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath78 follows a power law of the form @xmath82 with two regimes . for the first regime ,",
    "valid at small au np radii , the exponent @xmath22 is in the range 0.50.6 , while @xmath83 is in the range 1050 .",
    "for the second regime , valid at much larger au np radii , the characteristic distance to the surface reaches a saturation regime , where it becomes independent of the radius , @xmath78 .",
    "the exponent is then @xmath84 and we have @xmath85 nm ( [ fig:04a ] ) , much smaller than @xmath78 . in this latter regime quenching of the quantum system emission by the au np",
    "is significant only extremely close to the au np surface .",
    "as soon as the quantum system is removed from the surface of the au np , the emission quenching will no longer be of any importance , as the emission properties of the quantum system will be dominated by scattering from the au np .    for the first regime , of small au np radii ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath78 is approximately of the form @xmath86 .",

    "it is evident that the energy transfer process between donor and acceptor follows a @xmath99 dependence on their separation , and is , hence , a fret process .",

    "the lessons to be drawn from the first two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:06 ] are interesting : a fixed donor - au np separation leads to a fret - type behavior of the energy transfer efficiency , with an increased characteristic distance @xmath51 , which can be almost tripled .",
    "this suggests that such a system could be profitably used as a spectroscopic ruler : the fret - type behavior assures a consistent distance dependence over large ranges , while the increased characteristic distance @xmath51 extends the functional range of the ruler . a fixed acceptor - au np system , on the other hand",
    ", is not suitable as a spectroscopic ruler because , even though the characteristic distance @xmath51 is increased , there is no consistent distance dependence of the energy transfer efficiency .",
    "considering now the second ( [ fig:06c ] and [ fig:06d ] ) and third ( [ fig:06e ] and [ fig:06f ] ) sets of panels in fig .",
    "[ fig:06 ] , the first things to notice is an increase in the characteristic distance , @xmath51 , in the legends of the main panels , and a progressively more pronounced deviation of @xmath22 from the fret value of @xmath68 .",
    "these are a result of increasing the radius of the au np from @xmath90 nm to @xmath91 nm , to @xmath107 nm , with the effect that the range of donor - acceptor interaction is increased , and the higher - order multipoles of the au np contribute to this interaction .",
    "secondly , the characteristic distances in the insets of each panel , extracted from a pure fret fit , present an increase with the sphere size for a fixed donor - au np separation , but not for a fixed acceptor - au np separation .",
    "this happens because the fret fit is valid only at large overall donor - acceptor separations , where the et efficiency reverts to its value in the absence of the au np .      in the previous subsection ,",
    "the donor and acceptor were placed diametrically opposed around the sphere , i.e.  at antipodes , and the energy transfer efficiency was investigated as a function of their distance to the surface of the sphere alone .",
    "we now investigate the behavior of the energy transfer efficiency when the angular position of the donor and acceptor around the sphere is varied .",
    "[ fig:07 ] shows polar plots of the et efficiency for a donor - acceptor pair close to a au np of radius @xmath56 ( left column ) , @xmath91 nm ( middle column ) and @xmath92 nm ( right column ) .",

    ", the et efficiency around the au np is very close to 100% , for all three sphere sizes , and all acceptor distances to the surface of the au np , though it can be seen that the et efficiency begins to decrease for the largest acceptor distance , @xmath110 nm .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the larger au np , for which the donor - acceptor separation is larger .",
    "as the donor distance to the surface of the au np is increased , the angular dependence of the et efficiency is different for au nps of various sizes . in the case of the smallest au np with a radius @xmath90 nm ( left column in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] ) , the angular dependence of the et efficiency resembles the et efficiency in the absence of the au np , albeit with larger overall values .",
    "furthermore , the results obtained with this full method are practically indistinguisable from those obtained by treating the au np as a point dipole ( data not shown ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that the fret - type interaction we have seen being valid in the previous section on the distance dependence of the et rate , also describes the angular dependence in the case of the smallest sphere , @xmath90 nm .    for au np of larger sizes ( the middle , @xmath111 nm , and right columns , @xmath92 nm , in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] ) , the angular behavior of the et efficiency begins to deviate from a fret - type .",
    "this is especially notable in the appearance of a bulge at an angle @xmath112 , which contrasts with the dip observed in the free - space et efficiency at the same angle .",
    "moreover , when treating the au np as a point dipole , this bulge is absent , strongly suggesting that it is due to higher order multipoles of the au np .",
    "a final piece of evidence for this hypothesis is the fact that the bulge is less pronounced or dissappears when either the donor or acceptor is moved away from the surface of the au np and can no longer couple to these higher order modes .",
    "we now consider the dependence of the energy transfer rate and efficiency on the spectral overlap between the donor emission , acceptor absorption and the lsp peak of the au np . to this end",
    "we fix the position of the donor and acceptor at several distances from the surface of the au np , on opposite sides .",
    "we then consider gaussian distributions with a fixed width of 45 nm for the donor emission spectrum and we calculate the energy transfer rate as a function of the central wavelengths of these distributions . the results are shown in fig .",

    "the et enhancement peak is around 530 nm when both donor and acceptor are very close to the au np ( 3 nm ) and it blue - shifts to 520 nm when the donor and acceptor are moved away from the au np . as the size of the au np",

    "[ fig:08a ] with @xmath56 , the lsp is around @xmath115 .",
    "the maximum et rate enhancement for this case , however , occurs between the lsp peak at 500 nm and the near - field scattering peak at 540 nm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] for the spectral shapes of the extinction and the near - field scattering efficiencies of au nps of various sizes ) .",
    "this reflects the influence of the near - field of the au np , which has evanescent components not visible in far - field measurements , but which contribute to et close to the au np .",
    "another feature of the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig:08 ] is the broadening of the spectra with decreasing au np size .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:08 ] and is a consequence of the broadening of the lsp peak due to a surface scattering contribution in the dielectric function of au spheres of sizes below 50 nm.@xcite      finally , we investigate the dependence of the et efficiency on the size of the au np .",
    "[ fig:09 ] shows the sphere radius dependence of the et efficiency for several distances of the donor from the surface of the au np , @xmath116 nm ( panel [ fig:09a ] ) , @xmath93 nm ( panel [ fig:09b ] ) , @xmath117 nm ( panel [ fig:09c ] ) and @xmath118 nm ( panel [ fig:09d ] ) , and several distances of the acceptor from the surface of the au np ( @xmath119 nm to @xmath110 nm ) .",
    "+   +    the donor and acceptor are on opposite sides of the au np .",
    "when the donor distance to the surface of the au np is small , as in panel [ fig:09a ] , the et efficiency is almost 100% , for sphere radii up to 100 nm , when the acceptor distance to the surface is also relatively small . as the acceptor distance to the surface",
    "is increased , panel [ fig:09a ] shows the development of a peak in the et efficiency around and above 100 nm .",
    "this extra peak is not present when the au np is treated in the dipole approximation ; indeed , only when one takes into account multipole orders above the tenth , does the peak appear .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to attribute this peak to the higher order multipoles of the au nanosphere .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that the height of the peak decreases rapidly as the distance of either the donor or acceptor to the surface of the au np is increased .",
    "this suggests that the effect belongs to the near - field of the au np , which is in accordance with the effect being due to the higher multipoles of the au nanosphere .",
    "increasing the donor distance to the surface of the au np , as in panels [ fig:09b ] to [ fig:09d ] , the behaviour of the et efficiency changes quite dramatically , especially for very small sphere radii .",
    "when the radius of the au np is significantly smaller than the distance of either the donor or acceptor to the surface of the au np , the et efficiency can be considerably reduced .",
    "our simulations show , in fact , that in the limit @xmath120 , the et efficiency in the presence of the au np is equal to the et efficiency in free - space ( data not shown ) .",
    "in this contribution we have investigated the quenching of the emission of a quantum emitter placed close to au nps .",
    "we have employed a green s tensor formalism , which we have first validated by simulating experimental data obtained in our lab , for monolayers of qds on top of monolayers of au nps .",
    "we have found good agreement between this parameter - free simulation and the experimental measurements .",
    "subsequently , we have employed the green s tensor formalism to investigate the dependence of the quenching efficiency of a single qe close to a single au np on several parameters , such as the emission wavelength , intrinsic quantum yield of the qe , the size of the au np and the qe - au np distance .",
    "we have considered the dependence of the quenching efficiency on the emission wavelength and intrinsic quantum yield of the qe together , since these two parameters are often modified in tandem in experiments .",
    "we have found that the characteristic distance of the qd - au np pair increases monotonically with the quantum yield of the emitter , whereas the dependence on the emission wavelength of the emitter has a rather pronounced peak located between the lsp wavelength of the au np and the near - field scattering efficiency maximum . when considering the dependence of the quenching efficiency  or characteristic distance  experimentally , it is therefore important to take into account both of these dependences , as not to do so can give artifacts , such as an apparent shift of the maximum quenching efficiency with the emission wavelength of the emitter .",
    "we have also investigated the distance dependence of the quenching efficiency , mainly to ascertain under which conditions the fret model for the qe  au np interaction applies .",
    "our simulations show that the fret model provides a good approximation of the interaction , especially close to the lsp wavelength and for np sizes below @xmath121 . for larger spheres , not only",
    "does the exponent @xmath22 deviate from the value of 6 associated with the fret model , but the fit becomes poorer , suggesting that the single power law used in the fit no longer accurately applies .",
    "we must mention here that our model does not reproduce the experimental results obtained by the strousse group@xcite for the energy transfer from a quantum emitter , a fluorescent dye in this case , to a au np with a diameter of approximately @xmath122 nm . these authors have found that the distance dependence of the quenching efficiency is better described by the nset model , with a @xmath1 distance dependence .",
    "evidently , more research is required to elucidate this discrepancy .",
    "finally , considering the behavior of the quenching efficiency as a function of the size of the au np , we have seen that the characteristic distance to the au np surface is determined by the extinction cross - section of the np .",
    "thus , when the size of the au np is much smaller than the emission wavelength of the qe , the extinction cross - section is dominated by absorption and the characteristic distance can be 2 - 3 times larger than the np radius , following a power law dependence on the au np radius . in the size regime where scattering dominates the extinction cross - section ,",
    "this distance becomes constant and independent on the au np radius .",
    "quenching , in this latter case , occurs mainly very close to the np surface and the qe emission can be expected to be enhanced and not quenched further away from the surface .",
    "we have also investigated the energy transfer between a donor and acceptor .",
    "the energy transfer efficiency is much more sensitive to the donor - au np distance , than to the acceptor - au np distance .",
    "furthermore , the distance dependence of the energy transfer efficiency for fixed donor - au np separations suggests that the donor - acceptor interaction mediated by the au np is essentially of frster type , following a @xmath0 dependence on the donor - acceptor separation @xmath3 over a large distance range , but with an increased characteristic distance .",
    "this is not the case when the acceptor - au np separation is fixed . in this case",
    "the energy - transfer efficiency does not follow a frster dependence and it is influenced by the presence of the au np only for small donor - au np separations .",
    "the positioning of the donor and acceptor around the sphere can also influence the energy transfer , especially for smaller au nps and donors and acceptors placed very close to the au np . for small au np sizes ,",
    "the angular distribution of the et efficiency is similar to that for a dipole pair , albeit with an increased characteristic distance . as the size of the au np",
    "is increased , however , there is a marked deviation from the dipole pair behavior at an angle of @xmath112 .",
    "this can be attributed to the contribution of the higher order multipoles of the au np to the energy transfer process .    when investigating the dependence of the et transfer efficiency between a donor - acceptor pair placed near the au np on the emission wavelength of the donor , we have shown that the largest et rate does not occur at the lsp peak , but is red - shifted close to the peak in the near - field scattering efficiency .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that , when the donor - acceptor pair is placed in the near - field of the au np , the evanescent components of the electric field can act as a strong channel for the et process .",
    "this is more clearly apparent when one considers the et rate enhancement dependence on the donor - acceptor distance to the au np . in this case",
    "a gradual blue - shift towards the lsp wavelength occurs when the distance is increased and , hence , the evanescent component contribution becomes negligible .",
    "finally , an interesting behaviour of the et efficiency as a function of sphere radius has been obtained from our simulations .",
    "for relatively small distances of the donor and acceptor to the surface of the au np , in addition to the large et efficiency obtained for relatively small radii , there is an extra peak in the et efficiency when the radius is around 100 nm .",
    "we have shown that this peak is a consequence of the higher multipole orders of the au nanosphere contributing to the energy transfer process , for large enough spheres .    in this contribution",
    "we have undertaken a thorough investigation of the effects of a au np of subwavelength sizes on the decay and energy transfer processes of quantum systems placed in its vicinity .",
    "the increased characteristic distance provided by the au np can have interesting applications in improved sensing and as an extended spectroscopic ruler ."
