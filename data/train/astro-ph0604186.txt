    "from radio and x - ray studies of the milky way , about 230 supernova remnants ( snrs ) are known @xcite . however",
    ", a supernova ( sn ) outburst occurs every 3050 yr on average in a galaxy like the milky way @xcite .",
    "hence , if @xmath3  yr is taken to be the life time of a snr , the total number of remnants in our galaxy should be ( 23)@xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that most snrs are `` missing '' .",
    "recently , we proposed that small ( @xmath0 ) , faint , high - velocity features seen in large - scale 21-cm line surveys of atomic hydrogen ( hi ) in the galactic plane could be examples of such _ missing _ old snrs @xcite .",
    "these `` forbidden - velocity wings '' ( fvw ) appear in longitude - velocity diagrams as low - level , yet significant , bumps protruding from the regular galactic emission ( fig .",
    "the smooth boundary of the distribution in fig . 1 is given by the extent and rotational properties of the galactic gaseous disk .",
    "small - scale features lying significantly beyond these boundaries are likely to have originated from energetic phenomena .",
    "the strong , discrete emission feature at @xmath5 is a good example , and is associated with the collision of high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) with the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "fvws are distinguished from the hvcs in that they appear as protrusions from the galactic background emission , and not as separate discrete peaks . in fig .",
    "1 , fvw 190.2 + 1.1 , extending to @xmath6  at @xmath7 , is a typical example .",
    "we noted that there are many such fvws of unknown origin in the galactic plane and that these look similar to features observed towards old snrs . in the late stages of their evolution , snrs are expected to develop dense atomic shells which emit in the 21-cm line .",
    "however , because of confusion with emission from atomic gas along the line - of - sight , the radiation from an snr shell is only observable when its expansion velocity extends significantly beyond the maximum and/or minimum velocities permitted by galactic rotation , i.e. , when its emission appears as a protrusion in velocity ( see fig .",
    "systematic studies have been previously made towards two hundred _ known _ snrs , but high - velocity wings have _ only _ been detected towards two dozen @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that this relatively low detection rate is because these studies focused exclusively on cataloged radio - continuum / x - ray emitting snrs , hence excluding old snrs which have become too faint to be recognized in these ways @xcite .",
    "recent sensitive , high - resolution , radio continuum and x - ray observations have discovered several very faint snrs indicating that there are indeed many old snrs awaiting discovery @xcite . however , while we have proposed that the fvws are candidates for such _ missing _ old snrs , existing galactic plane surveys have insufficient resolution and/or sensitivity to reveal their true natures @xcite .    in this letter , we present the results of high - resolution observations of fvw 190.2 + 1.1 , the fvw shown in fig .",
    "1 , which show it to be a rapidly expanding shell , probably originating from a sn explosion .",
    "in february 2004 and 2005 , we used the arecibo 305-m telescope to obtain a high - resolution ( @xmath8 ) image of fvw 190.2 + 1.1 .",
    "total - intensity 21-cm spectra with a total bandwidth of 3.125  mhz and 1024 frequency channels were obtained using the dual - channel , linear polarization , l - wide receiver .",
    "this gave a velocity coverage of 660  and a velocity resolution of 1.29  after hanning smoothing .",
    "a rectangular area of @xmath9 centered at @xmath10 was mapped using fixed - azimuth drift scanning , with a @xmath11 step in declination .",
    "the resulting spectra were converted into antenna temperature , and then gridded via convolution to produce a data cube with a pixel size of @xmath11 and a final hpbw of @xmath12 .",
    "a polynomial baseline of order 25 was subtracted from each spectrum .",
    "the rms ( @xmath13 ) noise in the cube is @xmath14  k.    additionally , in january 2005 we searched for 2.5-ghz synchrotron emission from the shell of fvw 190.2 + 1.1 using the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "both linear polarizations were recorded using the dual polarization s - band receiver centered at 2.53 ghz and the gbt digital continuum receiver with a bandwidth of 12.5 mhz .",
    "a rectangular area of @xmath15 centered at @xmath16 was mapped using  on - the - fly \" data acquisition , with a scanning rate of @xmath17 along right ascension and a @xmath18 step in declination .",
    "the sampling interval was 0.1 s. noise power was injected on alternate samples to permit calibration of the total signal , ( including emission from the atmosphere , ground , and the galactic background ) , into system temperature .",
    "we obtained data for just the  source component \" by subtracting a smooth baseline from each scan .",
    "the resulting data were gridded by convolution to produce an image with a pixel size of @xmath18 and a hpbw of @xmath19 .",
    "we have compared the surface brightness across the intense , extended radio source sh 2 - 252 , situated within the field , to that from the bonn 11-cm survey @xcite .",
    "there was an excellent correlation between the two , although the brightness scale of the present data was lower than that of the bonn image by 23% and 37% for our respective orthogonal polarizations .",
    "we have scaled our data to that from bonn by multiplying each polarization by the appropriate constant value .",
    "the final image was produced by combining the brightness distributions for the two polarizations , and smoothing this with a gaussian beam of one - pixel dispersion , giving a hpbw of @xmath20 .",
    "the rms ( @xmath13 ) noise on the image is @xmath21  mk .",
    "2 shows the arecibo hi images of fvw 190.2 + 1.1 for different velocity intervals , together with a three - color map generated from these .",
    "an @xmath22-sized , mildly elliptical , shell structure is clearly seen , with its major axis aligned roughly east - west . the emission ring becomes smaller the more positive the velocity ( fig .",
    "3 ) indicating that we are seeing that portion of a shell which is expanding away from us . while the shell structure is visible for velocities between about + 25 and + 84 , the end - cap is not seen .",
    "the end - cap is expected to be faint because of the spreading of the intensity over a range of velocities due to turbulence within the shell @xcite . however , the upper limit on the column density of the end cap of fvw 190.2 + 1.1 is very low , e.g. , @xmath23 @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) over velocities between + 85 and + 95  , suggesting that the shell is probably incomplete towards this direction .",
    "the constant angular diameter at lower velocities indicates that this should be close to the size of the expanding shell , and that its systemic velocity is @xmath26  .",
    "another pointer to @xmath27 exists . to the east of the region",
    "studied , for @xmath2855  , there is faint background emission whose intensity drops steeply across the eastern ridge of the shell ( see the g and b images in fig .",
    "2 ) , indicating that this external emission is from ambient gas interacting with the shell .",
    "we see only the wing portion of this emission and , by least - squares fitting of the 21-cm line profile with several gaussian components , we obtain a central velocity of @xmath29  for this component",
    ". therefore , we have @xmath30  and adopt @xmath31  , where the error is a probable error @xcite . in this direction ,",
    "the lsr velocity is a shallow function of distance so that the systemic velocity does not yield a good kinematic distance .",
    "nevertheless , the systemic velocity is reliable , even if the distance to fvw 190.2 + 1.1 is only poorly constrained .",
    "expansion parameters for fvw 190.2 + 1.1 can be derived from the velocity - size dependence shown in fig .",
    "3 . the simplest model is a spherical shell expanding radially with uniform velocity .",
    "for this , the dotted curve shows the best - fit model which has an angular radius of @xmath32 and an expansion velocity of @xmath33  . in practice",
    ", the velocity - size relation derived appears to possess more of a linear form than having the concave shape predicted by the model .",
    "this difference can be explained by turbulent motions within the shell , e.g. the emission lines are broadened by turbulent motions , and this broadening makes the relation appear more linear .",
    "for example , the solid curve in fig .",
    "3 shows the result for a partially complete spherical shell with the above expansion velocity , but slightly ( 3% ) larger diameter and a line - of - sight turbulent velocity dispersion of @xmath34  .",
    "we therefore consider that the simplest model provides an acceptable description of the expansion properties of fvw 190.2 + 1.1 , and adopt @xmath35 and an expansion velocity of @xmath36  . for convenience ,",
    "we normalize the physical parameters to a distance of 10 kpc , giving a geometrical - mean radius @xmath37 pc , while the major and minor axes of the shell ( @xmath38 ) correspond to @xmath39  pc , where @xmath40 is the distance to fvw 190.2 + 1.1 in units of 10 kpc .",
    "we derive the mass of the shell using the channel maps . in each map ,",
    "we use nested elliptical rings to estimate how the mean intensity varies with distance from the geometrical center .",
    "the elliptical rings have an axial ratio of 1.24 ( @xmath41 ) and a thickness of @xmath42 ( = pixel size ) along the major and minor axes . the plot of the mean intensity as a function of radial distance reveals a bump which peaks at the location of the shell .",
    "we fit a smooth baseline and obtain the integrated flux density in the bump which can be easily converted to mass given that the emission is optically thin .",
    "the derived shell mass over the velocity range of + 4080  is @xmath43  .",
    "the mass per unit velocity interval increases as the velocity decreases .",
    "this is a general trend for rapidly expanding shells and has been attributed to the clumpy nature of the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to derive the total mass of the expanding shell , we need to estimate the mass in the unobserved portion of the shell lying at lower velocities ( @xmath44  ) where the background emission dominates .",
    "the mass distribution can be described by a gaussian , and we estimate the total mass by fitting a gaussian centered at @xmath27 .",
    "the extrapolated total mass of the shell is @xmath45  . including the cosmic abundance of helium , the corresponding kinetic energy of the shell is @xmath46  erg .",
    "the large extrapolation factor means that the estimated total mass has a greater relative uncertainty .",
    "however , if the energetic phenomenon that produced the expanding shell had spherical symmetry , the derived kinetic energy should be reasonably ( @xmath47% ) accurate .    as seen from fig . 2 ( lower right panel ) , no 2.5  ghz - continuum emission is detected from  with an ( @xmath25 ) upper limit of @xmath48 k , corresponding to a 1-ghz surface brightness of @xmath49 w  m@xmath50  hz@xmath51  sr@xmath51 , assuming that flux density varies with frequency as @xmath52 , with @xmath53 .",
    "the shell is seen in neither the iras maps at 60 and 100 @xmath54 m nor the distribution of their ratio .",
    "it is also not seen in dss optical , vtss h@xmath55 , or rosat all - sky x - ray survey images @xcite .",
    "fvw 190.2 + 1.1 has a large ( @xmath56  ) expansion velocity .",
    "although there have been discoveries of expanding shells and supershells , their expansion velocities are usually @xmath57   @xcite .",
    "shells with expansion velocities comparable to that of fvw 190.2 + 1.1 have only been found toward old snrs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , suggesting a sn origin for this shell . for a snr shell , the initial explosion energy , @xmath58 , can be estimated from @xmath59 erg , where @xmath60 is the ambient density of hydrogen nuclei in @xmath61 , @xmath62 is in pc , @xmath63 is in , and @xmath64 is the metallicity @xcite .",
    "we estimate the ambient density for fvw  190.2 + 1.1 by assuming that the current mass in the shell was initially distributed uniformly over the volume contained within the shell .",
    "this yields @xmath65  @xmath61 .",
    "the metallicity in the outer galaxy is significantly lower than in the solar neighborhood , and we adopt @xmath66 which is the metallicity at @xmath67 kpc based on @xcite .",
    "however , since the sn energy depends only very weakly on the metallicity , the following discussion will not be affected by our adopted metallicity .",
    "substituting these values , @xmath68  erg .",
    "for the canonical value of @xmath69  erg , this implies a distance of 8  kpc , corresponding to @xmath70  pc and a dynamical age of @xmath71  yr .",
    "the distance appears rather larger than expected for a sn explosion in the galaxy , but is not unreasonable .",
    "it is also consistent with the empirical surface brightness - diameter ( @xmath72 ) relation for snrs . extrapolating the @xmath72 relation of @xcite",
    ", we note that our 1-ghz continuum brightness upper limit is comparable to that predicted for a snr shell of radius , @xmath73  pc . despite the large scatter of the @xmath72 relation , this is also consistent with fvw 190.2 + 1.1 being a large , old snr .",
    "we further note that several sharpless hii regions have been discovered at such distances toward the anticenter region , including sh 2 - 259 which is at 8.3 kpc toward @xmath74 and has a similar radial velocity to fvw 190.2 + 1.1 ( @xmath75  ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed the existence of a remote spiral arm connecting these hii regions from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , and it is quite possible that fvw 190.2 + 1.1 is a snr associated with this .",
    "large , fast - expanding shells can also be produced by stellar winds from ob stars .",
    "the wind luminosity required to drive fvw 190.2 + 1.1 would be @xmath78 erg s@xmath51 @xcite , which even for a distance as close as 1 kpc corresponds to a star earlier than o6v @xcite .",
    "the only early - type star with a comparable luminosity within the field of fig . 2 is hd 42088 , the o6.5v star exciting the sharpless hii region sh 2 - 252 at 2 kpc @xcite . however , this star is situated outside of the shell , and no morphological connection is apparent between the hii region and the shell .",
    "also , if the shell were to have been produced by an o6.5 star , it would not be expected to be neutral because of the strong ionizing radiation .",
    "we further note that many high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) forming a complex chain have been observed near @xmath79  in this region of the anticenter @xcite .",
    "these hvcs are colliding with the galactic gaseous disk and generating a huge ( @xmath80 ) supershell , essentially all of whose gas is moving at negative radial velocities @xcite .",
    "fvw 190.2 + 1.1 is much smaller , and is seen at positive radial velocities , making it unlikely to be associated with the hvcs .",
    "summarizing , the lack of a viable alternative explanation for its characteristics , strongly supports fvw190.2 + 1.1 being an old snr .",
    "this indicates that a snr expanding as fast as 80  can be `` dark '' , i.e. essentially invisible in the radio continuum .",
    "fvw 190.2 + 1.1 is one of a hundred fv wings recently identified in the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "these are found in both the inner and outer galaxy , and also rather far from the galactic plane ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "comparison with existing catalogs has shown that only @xmath82% of these fvws are associated with known external galaxies , hvcs , or snrs , and the natures of most remain a puzzle .",
    "nevertheless , our present discovery suggests that many are likely to be among the oldest snrs .",
    "we note that very recent arecibo observations made by ourselves of about ten fvws do reveal expanding shell structures towards half of them , which supports this conjecture .",
    "the other half show arc- , or ring - like structures which could also be fragments of disrupted old snr shells .",
    "it has been known for some time that our galaxy contains gas with a large velocity dispersion and extending far from the disk  the halo @xcite .",
    "recent high - resolution observations reveal small ( @xmath83  pc ) , fast - moving clouds that constitute this high velocity dispersion gas @xcite .",
    "thus , it was suggested that our galaxy may possess a population of fast - moving clouds distributed both throughout the disk and up into the halo , and that about one half of the galactic halo could be in the form of discrete clouds @xcite .",
    "these fast - moving clouds have similar properties to fvws in that both appear at forbidden velocities and , for both , the higher the peculiar velocity , the smaller the mass . however , the fast - moving clouds generally have lower velocities than the fvws , are of higher column density , and appear as distinct clouds .",
    "it is possible that these clouds are also fragments of old snr shells , but of older , more disrupted examples than those associated with fvws .",
    "the nature of fvws and their relation to the galactic structure should soon be revealed by new high - sensitivity , high - resolution surveys such as those recently undertaken with the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) .",
    "we thank phil perillat for his help with data reduction at arecibo .",
    "we also wish to thank the green bank staff for their support , particularly tony minter , jay lockman , dana balser , and carl bignell .",
