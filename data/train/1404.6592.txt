    "consider an oriented spherical triangle @xmath1 on the unit sphere @xmath2 embedded in @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the unit vectors in @xmath3 from the center of @xmath2 to the vertices of @xmath1 . in the common nomenclature of spherical trigonometry ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the lengths of the sides opposite the vertices @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "these spherical lengths are angles between the unit vectors in @xmath3 , so that @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the @xmath0 matrix formed from the components of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 as columns , and let @xmath14 be the oriented ( signed ) area of @xmath1 .",
    "the sine of half the oriented area is given by a formula recently established by tuynman @xcite : @xmath15 note that the factors in the denominator may be expressed in terms of the side lengths through @xmath16 , and similarly for the other factors , so that equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - tuynman ] ) may be written as @xmath17 in equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - intermediate ] ) @xmath13 has been abbreviated simply as @xmath18 and we have replaced @xmath19 with @xmath20 in anticipation of the algebraic manipulations to follow . in equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - tuynman ] ) and in many to follow , none of the dot products between the vertex unit vectors can be allowed to take the value @xmath21 , that is , for the vertices to be antipodal .",
    "thus we must exclude triangles with antipodal vertices from further consideration , or otherwise resolve the indeterminant form @xmath22 with lhpital s rule .",
    "for simplicity of exposition , we choose to do the former .",
    "moreover , we will take only the positive root of @xmath23 .",
    "this is tantamount to a requirement that all triangles under consideration have a positive orientation , so that _ all _ determinants that will appear in this note are strictly greater than zero .",
    "to emphasize : @xmath24 and @xmath25 throughout .",
    "the tuynman formula is closely related to the classical area formulas of euler and of cagnoli ( see , for instance , the book by donnay @xcite ) . to establish the equivalence of these formulas we form the symmetric matrix product @xmath26 and find its determinant to be @xmath27 the euler formula relates the _ cosine _ of half the area to the side lengths while the cagnoli formula , as does equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - intermediate ] ) , relates the _ sine _ of half the area to the lengths . from the trigonometric identity @xmath28 we have @xmath29 the radicand in equation ( [ equation : intermediate - step ] )",
    "is @xmath30 from which the euler formula follows : @xmath31 equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - euler ] ) may be recast with vector dot products in @xmath3 , similar to equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - tuynman ] ) , as @xmath32 in a similar fashion one may begin with equations ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - intermediate ] ) and ( [ equation : matrix - product - determinant ] ) , and through the judicious use of standard trigonometric identities , arrive at the classical formula of cagnoli : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the semi - perimeter of @xmath1 . as an excursion ,",
    "let us rediscover a variant of the cagnoli formula in terms of the medial triangle @xmath35 of triangle @xmath1 .",
    "as discussed by tuynman @xcite , equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - tuynman ] ) takes the simple form @xmath36 when expressed in terms of the side midpoint unit vectors @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the midpoint formula ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - tuynman - midpoint ] ) follows immediately from the properties of @xmath40 : linearity in each column and anti - symmetry with respect to the interchange of columns . from equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - tuynman - midpoint ] ) it is clear that @xmath41 , as required .",
    "let @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the lengths of the sides opposite the vertices in @xmath35 . by direct comparison of equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - intermediate ] ) versus ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - cagnoli ] )",
    "we have , without further effort , the cagnoli equivalent of ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - tuynman - midpoint ] ) : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the semi - perimeter of the medial triangle @xmath35 .",
    "for completeness we also present an equivalent of the euler formula ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - euler ] ) : @xmath47 let us conclude this section with a few remarks . in the subsequent development we will not make any use of the interior angles , conventionally denoted @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , associated with the vertices @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "these angles are also the dihedral angles between the planes spanned , in the case of @xmath50 for instance , the basis sets \\ { @xmath4 , @xmath6 } and \\",
    "{ @xmath5 , @xmath6 } . the dihedral product ( a notion valid in any dimension ) between these planes is @xmath51 , the law of cosines for a spherical triangle .",
    "the area of a spherical triangle is known to be the same as its angular excess @xmath52 .",
    "while , through the law of cosines , each interior angle can be related to the arc - cosine of some combination of vector dot products , we have yet to explore this avenue .",
    "let us take a point @xmath53 interior to or on the boundary of @xmath1 and construct the edges @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this results in a partition of @xmath1 into three _ positively _ oriented triangles",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 with a common vertex @xmath53 . denote their respective area functions by @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . should @xmath53 coincide with any of the vertices @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 we must recover the undivided triangle so that @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the three area functions must sum to the total area of @xmath1 @xmath66 define @xmath67 and @xmath68 as @xmath69 so that equations ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - euler - vector ] ) and ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - tuynman ] ) may be written concisely as @xmath70 and @xmath71 similar expressions for @xmath72 and @xmath73 are obtained through cyclic permutation of the vertices @xmath74 .",
    "again , in the formation of the @xmath0 matrices we must keep the columns ordered as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "we wish to find the exterior derivative @xmath42 of @xmath61 in terms of the vector - valued 1-form @xmath78 . upon application of @xmath42 to equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - euler - brief ] ) we have @xmath79 or , from equation ( [ equation : sphere - triangle - area - tuynman - brief ] ) , @xmath80 \\frac{df_a}{f_a } \\ .\\ ] ] from equation ( [ equation : f ] ) we have @xmath81 after some rearrangement our final result for @xmath82 is @xmath83 b \\cdot dx + \\left [ 1 - \\frac{b \\cdot ( x + c)}{1 + c \\cdot x } \\right ] c \\cdot dx \\ , \\ ] ] with similar formulas for @xmath84 and @xmath85 obtained through cyclic permutation of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 be the barycentric coordinates of the point @xmath53 interior to or on the boundary of @xmath1 , such that @xmath89",
    ". should @xmath53 reside on the side @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "should @xmath53 coincide with the vertex @xmath4 , @xmath93 , @xmath91 and @xmath94 .",
    "similar statements hold for the other two sides and the other two vertices .",
    "the @xmath95 are the three whitney 0-forms associated with the vertices @xmath96 of the triangle .",
    "recall that the three whitney 1-forms associated with the sides of the triangle are defined through exterior differentiation as @xmath97 for @xmath98 = @xmath90 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath101 be the great circle arc that joins the vertices @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the whitney forms are defined such that @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and so forth .",
    "let us introduce the vector function @xmath107 as @xmath108 b + \\left [ 1 - \\frac{b \\cdot ( x + c)}{1 + c \\cdot x } \\right ] c\\ ] ] so that @xmath109 or @xmath110 and in a similar manner @xmath111 and @xmath112 note that equation ( [ equation : d_lambda_a ] ) for @xmath113 is indeterminant of order @xmath22 in the limits @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and likewise for @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "that this is so can be seen from the definition ( [ equation : f_definition ] ) and that fact that @xmath118 .",
    "since the denominators are all linear in @xmath53 , all of these limits must be finite .",
    "to elaborate somewhat on our formalism , @xmath119 is the tangent bundle to @xmath3 ( the manifold of tangent spaces at each point ) and @xmath120 is the tangent bundle @xmath119 restricted to the surface of the unit sphere .",
    "we assert that the @xmath121 should be in @xmath122 , as their genesis was through differentiation at the point @xmath53 .",
    "this is just a fancy way to say that the vector @xmath121 should be thought of as anchored at @xmath53 , and that a vector field in @xmath120 should be thought of as a field of vectors all anchored to the surface of @xmath2 but which point in any direction in @xmath3 .",
    "these careful distinctions are not necessary for actual calculations . to continue with the whitney forms , the 1-form @xmath123 , for instance , is @xmath124 where we have also used the symmetry @xmath125 to keep the formula explicitly anti - symmetric in @xmath4 and @xmath5 . as the functions @xmath95 must contain either an arc - cosine or an arc - sine , depending on the choice of area formula",
    ", we have not found any further simplifications thus far .",
    "we turn now to the whitney 2-form @xmath126 since @xmath127 , one may in fact use any side , as @xmath128 . from equations ( [ equation :",
    "d_lambda_a ] ) and ( [ equation : d_lambda_b ] ) the whitney 2-form is @xmath129 the whitney 2-form ( [ equation : d_lambda_abc ] ) has a very special property : @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "this is easy to see when the integral is done in barycentric coordinates : @xmath131 note that the lower limit of integration for @xmath132 is @xmath133 , when @xmath134 , and that the upper limit is @xmath135 , when @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath14 is the area of @xmath1 and so might better be written as an explicit function of the vertices as @xmath137 .",
    "now any 2-form on @xmath2 is the product of some function @xmath138 and the area 2-form @xmath139 , so that @xmath140 we wish to find @xmath141 . to do this we jump back into @xmath3 and",
    "introduce a radial coordinate @xmath142 . a position vector @xmath143 in @xmath3",
    "is just @xmath144 where @xmath142 is its distance from the center of @xmath2 . now",
    "the volume 3-form in @xmath3 should be @xmath145 .",
    "since @xmath146 we have @xmath147 or @xmath148 . also note that @xmath149 for any vector @xmath150 , so that @xmath151 after a moment of contemplation one should realize that @xmath152 for any three vectors @xmath153 in @xmath3 , ergo : @xmath154 } \\ .\\ ] ] now since @xmath155 , it must be that @xmath156 } { s \\left ( a , b , c \\right ) \\det \\left [ m \\left ( b , c , x \\right ) m \\left ( c , a , x \\right ) \\right ] } \\ .\\ ] ] from equation ( [ equation : f_definition ] ) one may observe that in general @xmath141 appears to be the sum of three rational functions in the cartesian coordinates of @xmath53 , each of which is the ratio of a third order polynomial to a fourth order polynomial . by the whitney construction @xmath157",
    "must be invariant under cyclic permutation of @xmath74 , however a direct proof from equation ( [ equation : rational_function ] ) has so far eluded us .",
    "one might also notice that @xmath157 inherits indeterminant limits from the whitney 1-forms , which can be seen all to be finite .",
    "plots of @xmath157 for selected triangles can be found on pages 10 through 12 . in article",
    "ii of this series , we will have a much closer look at the visualization of @xmath157 , as well as the whitney 1-forms , for various triangles .",
    "we will also work out in more detail special examples , such as the @xmath158 and the @xmath159 isosceles triangles . to conclude our development , we delve a bit further into the notion of the vector - valued 1-form @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath160 for @xmath161 be an orthonormal vector frame on the tangent bundle @xmath162 , the _ repre mobile _ of cartan @xcite and @xmath163 its dual 1-form basis in the cotangent bundle @xmath164 such that @xmath165 . in the formalism of cartan @xmath166 , with summation implied over repeated lower and upper indices .",
    "this states that the vector - valued 1-form @xmath78 is a map @xmath167 .",
    "that is to say , for any vector field @xmath150 in @xmath120 the interior product @xmath168 returns that part of @xmath150 tangential to @xmath2 .",
    "this we already know , as @xmath169 implies @xmath118 , or to belabor the point , @xmath170 . to make the ideas of cartan more tangible , let us work out explicitly the simple case in which the standard spherical coordinates @xmath171 are used to locate a point @xmath53 on the unit sphere . in this case",
    "@xmath172 and @xmath173 as @xmath174 and @xmath175 are an orthonormal basis on @xmath164 such that the metric tensor is @xmath176 .",
    "but @xmath177 comprise the familiar orthonormal frame on @xmath162 for which @xmath178 , so that indeed @xmath179 .",
    "in this paper we have found compact formulas for the whitney forms of a spherical triangle . given the plethora of identities in spherical trigonometry , there are doubtless many alternative ways to effect this construction .",
    "of all the alternatives that we have explored , however , the method presented here is the most succinct .",
    "there are numerous possible continuations and applications of these developments .",
    "first and foremost , we wish to obtain a deeper understanding of the rational functions on @xmath3 that relate a whitney 2-form to the area 2-form .",
    "the @xmath157 rationals have three poles on @xmath2 that coincide with the antipodal points of the vertices , and we would like to find a relationship between the extrema and the vertices . perhaps one can approach this question through the pullback of the whitney forms , via an inverse stereographic projection , onto the extended complex plane @xmath180 . in the realm of partial differential equations ,",
    "whitney forms are relevant to the finite element and discrete exterior calculus @xcite .",
    "the spherical whitney forms may have potential use in the formulation of finite element spaces intrinsic to the sphere .",
    "in such a case , one expects to be confronted with integrals such as @xmath181 in various combinations and for every triangle @xmath182 in a geodesic triangulation of @xmath2 .",
    "these integrals must be computed through numerical quadrature , and implementation of algorithms for this purpose may be pursued in future work .",
    "generalization to three - dimensional geometry when spherical coordinate systems are employed may also be of interest . here",
    "one could attempt to define barycentric coordinates and find the whitney forms for a right triangular prism in which the bottom and top faces of the prism are spherical triangles situated on spheres of different radii .",
    "the tuynman formula also holds for triangles of the hyperbolic plane @xmath183 embedded in three - dimensional minkowski space , that is , @xmath3 endowed with a metric @xmath184 .",
    "the whitney constructions certainly have analogs on @xmath183 , and we would like to see the @xmath157 rationals on the poincar disc .",
    "further questions naturally arise , such as : does the tuynman formula generalize to higher dimensions , such as to the volume of a spherical tetrahedron in @xmath185 ? does it generalize to two - dimensional de sitter space ?",
    "the original development of the tuynman formula and its precursors occurred in the context of stereographic projection and the extended complex plane @xcite .",
    "other techniques in spherical trigonometry that exploit the conformal nature of the stereographic projection were developed by cesro in the early part of last century @xcite . while the approach in this paper was strictly algebraic ,",
    "we intend to explore further the rich geometric aspects of these problems in subsequent articles .",
