    "<S> we investigate the competition between two quasispecies residing on two disparate neutral networks . under the assumption that the two neutral networks have different topologies and fitness levels , </S>",
    "<S> it is the mutation rate that determines which quasispecies will eventually be driven to extinction . for small mutation rates , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quasispecies residing on the neutral network with the lower replication rate will disappear . for higher mutation rates </S>",
    "<S> , however , the faster replicating sequences may be outcompeted by the slower replicating ones in case the connection density on the second neutral network is sufficiently high . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results are in excellent agreement with flow - reactor simulations of replicating rna sequences .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : quasispecies , mutant cloud , neutral networks , rna secondary structure folding , selection of robustness    at high mutation rates , the number of mutated offspring generated in a population far exceeds the number of offspring identical to their parents . as a result , a stable cloud of mutants , a so - called quasispecies  , forms around the fastest replicating genotypes . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidence in favor of such a persistent cloud of mutants is available from rna viruses   and in vitro rna replication  ; both are cases in which a high substitution rate per nucleotide is common  . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a quasispecies has important implications for the way in which selection acts , because the evolutionary success of individual sequences depends on the overall growth rate of the quasispecies they belong to . as a consequence , organisms with a high replication rate that produce a large number of offspring with poor fitness </S>",
    "<S> can be outcompeted by organisms of smaller fitness that produce a larger number of also - fit offspring  . similarly , </S>",
    "<S> if a percentage of the possible mutations is neutral , and the majority of the non - neutral mutations is strongly deleterious , then the growth rate of a quasispecies depends significantly on the connection density ( the number of nearby neutral mutants of an average viable genotype ) of the neutral genotypes  . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a neutral network ( a set of closely related mutants with identical fitness ) with high connectivity can be advantageous over one with higher fitness , but lower connectivity . here , we are interested in this latter possibility . in particular , we investigate the competition of two quasispecies residing on separate neutral networks with different connection densities and replication rates , and determine under what conditions selection favors the more fit ( i.e. , of higher replication rate ) or the more robust ( more densely connected ) mutant cloud . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is closely related to the study of holey landscapes , in which all genotypes are classified into either viable or inviable ones  . </S>",
    "<S> however , we extend this picture by further subdividing the viable genotypes into two groups with different replication rates .    the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , we describe a simple model of a quasispecies on a single neutral network , and demonstrate that the model is consistent with simulations of rna sequences </S>",
    "<S> . then , based on this model , we present a model of two competing quasispecies , and compare the second model with simulation results as well . following that , we study the probability of fixation of a single advantageous mutant that arises in a fully formed quasispecies . finally , we discuss the implications of our results and give conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> population dynamics on a single neutral network    before we can address the competition of two quasispecies , we need a good description of a single quasispecies on a neutral network . </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental contribution to this problem has been made by , who showed that the average fitness of a population on a neutral network is determined only by the fitness of the neutral genotypes , the mutation rate , and the largest eigenvalue of the neutral genotypes connection matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the connection matrix is a symmetric matrix with one row / column per neutral genotype . </S>",
    "<S> it holds a one in those positions where the row- and the column - genotype are exactly one point - mutation apart , and a zero otherwise . in theory , the formalism of van nimwegen et al .  describes a population on a neutral network well </S>",
    "<S> however , the exact connection matrix is normally not known , which implies that we can not calculate the population dynamics from first principles . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we can base a very simple model on the fact  also established by van nimwegen et al. that the average neutrality in the population , which is exactly the largest eigenvalue of the connection matrix , is independent of the mutation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the main assumption of our simple model is that the population behaves as if all sequences in the population had the same neutrality @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is given by the average neutrality in the population . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we consider genetic sequences of length @xmath1 , and assume a per - symbol copy fidelity of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . then , the effective copy fidelity or neutral fidelity   @xmath3 , i.e. , the probability with which on average a viable sequence gives birth to offspring that also resides on the neutral network , is given by @xmath4^l\\notag\\\\     & \\approx e^{-l(1-q)(1-\\nu)}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , we can devise a two - concentration model in which @xmath5 is the total concentration of all sequences on the neutral network , and @xmath6 is the concentration of sequences off the network ( these sequences are assumed to replicate so slowly that their offspring can be neglected ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two quantities satisfy the equations    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the fitness of the sequences on the neutral network , and @xmath9 is the excess production ( or mean fitness in the population ) @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> equation   can be integrated directly . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath11e^{-w_1qt}}\\,.\\ ] ] in the steady state ( @xmath12 ) , this implies that the concentration of sequences on the network is equal to the effective fidelity @xmath3 , @xmath13 therefore , by measuring the decay of the concentration of sequences on the neutral network as a function of the copy fidelity @xmath2 , we can estimate the population neutrality @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the above description of the evolving population is similar to the one presented by  , with one important conceptual difference . </S>",
    "<S> the article by was completed before van nimwegen et al.s work was available , and therefore it was not clear what their effective fidelity did actually relate to . here </S>",
    "<S> , on the other hand , we know that @xmath3 depends only on the copy fidelity per nucleotide , @xmath2 , and the average population neutrality @xmath0 , which is independent of @xmath2 and could be calculated exactly if the connection matrix of the neutral genotypes was known .    </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the average equilibrium concentration @xmath14 of sequences on the network for rna secondary structure folding . </S>",
    "<S> rna folding is a reliable test case , and has been applied to a wide array of different questions related to the dynamics of evolution  . </S>",
    "<S> we simulated a flow reactor using the gillespie algorithm  , and performed the rna folding with the vienna package  , version 1.3.1 , which uses the parameters given by  . </S>",
    "<S> the carrying capacity was set to @xmath15 sequences , and the reactor was initially filled with 1000 identical copies of a sequence that folded into a given target structure . </S>",
    "<S> sequences folding into the target structure were replicating with rate one per unit time , and all other sequences with rate @xmath16 per unit time . </S>",
    "<S> we let the reactor equilibrate for 50 time steps , and then measured the average concentration of correctly folding sequences over the next 150 time steps .    </S>",
    "<S> results for the two different target structures depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : folds ] are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : decay ] . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> , we see a very clear exponential decay . </S>",
    "<S> up to a mutation rate of @xmath17 , which is quite high for the sequences of length @xmath18 we are considering here , we can not make out a significant deviation from a straight line in the log - linear plot . </S>",
    "<S> this verifies the applicability of our simple model to evolving rna sequences . </S>",
    "<S> note that our simulations also show a significant difference in the effective neutrality of the two structures , which will be of importance in the next section .    </S>",
    "<S> two competing quasispecies    _ analytical model _    above </S>",
    "<S> , we have established a simple description for a quasispecies residing on a single neutral network . in a similar fashion </S>",
    "<S> , we can treat the competition of two quasispecies residing on separate networks . </S>",
    "<S> we classify all sequences into three different groups : sequences on network one , sequences on network two , and dead sequences ( sequences that replicate much slower than sequences on either of the two networks , or do not replicate at all ) . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the respective relative concentrations by @xmath14 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we make the further assumption that all sequences within a neutral network @xmath21 have the same probability @xmath22 to mutate into another sequence on network @xmath21 , and we neglect mutations from one network to the other . the probability to fall off of a network @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> is hence @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the differential equations for an infinite population are then :    [ eq : basic - model ] @xmath24    where @xmath8 and @xmath25 are the fitnesses of sequences on network one or two , respectively , and @xmath9 is the excess production @xmath26 . in order to solve eq .  , it is useful to introduce the matrix @xmath27 we further need the exponential of @xmath28 , which is given by @xmath29 now , if we combine the concentrations @xmath14 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 into a vector @xmath30 , we find @xmath31\\ ] ] with @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the denominator on the right - hand side of eq .   corresponds to the cumulative excess production @xmath33 , which is given by @xmath34 the solution to eq .   </S>",
    "<S> follows now as    [ eq:3conc - sol ] @xmath35\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there exist two possible steady states . if @xmath36 , then for @xmath12 we have @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 . if @xmath40 , on the other hand , the steady state distribution if given by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting situation occurs when for a given @xmath8 and @xmath25 , the steady state depends on the mutation rate . </S>",
    "<S> this happens if @xmath44 , but @xmath45 , or vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> namely , if we express @xmath22 as given in eq .  , we obtain from @xmath46 the critical copy fidelity @xmath47 clearly , @xmath48 can only be smaller than one if either @xmath44 and @xmath45 or vice versa . therefore , this is a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for the existence of two qualitatively different steady states in different mutational regimes . in the language of physics , the transition from one of the two steady state to the other is a first order phase transition  . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is of first order because the order parameter ( which we can define to be either @xmath14 or @xmath19 ) undergoes a discontinuous jump from a finite value to zero at the critical mutation rate .    </S>",
    "<S> the two phases are not just a mathematical curiosity , they have important biological interpretations . </S>",
    "<S> the phase in which the sequences with the larger @xmath49 survive can be considered the `` normal '' selection regime , i.e. , selection which favors faster replicating individuals . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to this situation as the phase of `` selection for replication speed '' . in the other phase , however , the situation is exactly reversed , and the sequences with the lower intrinsic replication rate @xmath50 prevail . in this phase , the amount of neutrality ( or the robustness against mutations ) is more important , and we will consequently refer to this situation as the phase of `` selection for robustness '' . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phases ] , we show two example phase diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> these diagrams demonstrate that the selection for robustness is not a pathological situation occurring only for extremely rare sets of parameters , but that in fact both phases have to be considered on equal grounds , none of them can be singled out as the more common one . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as the ratio between @xmath8 and @xmath25 approaches unity , the selection for robustness becomes more and more important </S>",
    "<S> .    _ simulation results _    as in the case of a single quasispecies on a neutral network </S>",
    "<S> , we have tested our predictions with simulations of self - replicating rna sequences in a flow reactor . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed that sequences folding into either fold  1 or  2 ( fig .  [ fig : folds ] ) were replicating with rates @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , while all other folds had a vanishing replication rate . in all results presented below , we initialized the flow reactor with 50% of the sequences folding into fold  1 , and the remaining sequences folding into fold  2 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : comp0_01 ] shows a comparison between eq .   and four example runs . </S>",
    "<S> apart from finite size fluctuations , which are to be expected in a simulation with @xmath15 , the analytic expression predicts the actual population dynamics well .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fave - vs - mutrate ] , we present measurements of the concentrations @xmath5 and @xmath53 as functions of the mutation rate @xmath54 , for a fixed time @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the points represent results averaged over 25 independent simulations , and the lines stem from eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> in agreement with the predictions from our model , we observe two selection regimes , one in which the faster replicating sequences dominate , and one in which the sequences with the higher neutrality have a selective advantage . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between the two phases occurs in this particular case approximately at @xmath56 , and both the analytical model and the simulations agree well on this value . as is typical for a phase transition , the fluctuations close to the transition point increase significantly , and the time until either of the two quasispecies has gone extinct diverges ( the latter point can be seen from the fact that close to the transition point , the disadvantageous fold is still present in a sizeable amount , while further away it has already vanished completely from the population ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fave - vs - mutrate ] also shows that for very small populations , the predictive value of the differential equation approach diminishes , presumably because the choice of a single effective copy fidelity @xmath3 is not justified anymore once a minimum population size has been reached . however , as long as we are dealing with population sizes of several hundreds or more , our analytical calculations predict the simulation results very well </S>",
    "<S> .    _ probability of fixation _    in the previous subsection , we have established that selection acts on the product of replication rate @xmath50 and fidelity @xmath3 , rather than on the replication rate alone . in particular , for an appropriate choice of parameters , sequences with a lower replication rate can outcompete those with a higher replication rate . however , the competition experiments that we conducted in the previous section were unrealistic in so far that we assumed equal initial concentrations of the two competing types of sequences . </S>",
    "<S> a more realistic assumption is that one type ( the one with the lower product @xmath57 ) dominates the population , while the second type is initially represented through only a single individual . </S>",
    "<S> the idea behind this scenario is of course that the second type ( with higher product @xmath57 ) has arisen through a rare mutation . </S>",
    "<S> the question in this context is whether the second type will be able to dominate the population , i.e. , whether it will become fixated .    in a standard population genetics scenario , the answer to </S>",
    "<S> the above question is simple . </S>",
    "<S> if two sequences replicate with @xmath8 and @xmath25 , respectively , and mutations between the two sequences can be neglected , then a single sequence of type 2 ( @xmath58 ) will become fixated in a background of sequences of type 1 with probability @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the selective advantage of the newly introduced sequence type  . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that this celebrated result is only correct for a generational model with discrete time steps . in a continuous time model , the equivalent result reads @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this formula follows from the solution to the problem of the gambler s ruin   when taking the limit of a large population size .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we are not dealing with individual sequences replicating with rate @xmath49 , but rather with quasispecies that grow with rate @xmath57 . a naive way to calculate the fixation probability in this case </S>",
    "<S> is simply to replace @xmath49 with @xmath57 in the expression for the selective advantage , and hope that the result is correct . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not clear from the outset that this approach will work , because the factor @xmath22 depends on the assumption that a fully developed quasispecies with the appropriate mean neutrality is already present . a single sequence struggling for fixation does not satisfy this condition . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the actual fixation probability might deviate from the one thus calculated , in particular in circumstances in which a sequence with smaller replication rate is supposed to overtake an established quasispecies of sequences with higher replication rate .    </S>",
    "<S> we performed fixation experiments in both the `` selection for replication speed '' and the `` selection for robustness '' phase , in order to clarify whether the naive approach works . in both phases </S>",
    "<S> , we allowed a population of size @xmath15 to equilibrate , and then introduced a single sequence of the supposedly advantageous type . </S>",
    "<S> after 500 time steps , we determined whether the advantageous type had vanished from the population or grown to a significant proportion . by repeating this procedure 100 times </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained an estimate for the probability of fixation . </S>",
    "<S> as in the previous section , we used @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fixation - prob ] , we compare our simulation results to the predicted fixation probability @xmath61 . within the accuracy of our results , both agree well . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly interesting for mutation rates above @xmath62 , where we introduce a sequence of lower replication rate into a background of faster replicating sequences . </S>",
    "<S> the increased neutrality of the introduced sequence is sufficient to let it rise to fixation in a significant proportion of cases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the product @xmath57 is the sole determinant of the fixation probability . </S>",
    "<S> whether the value of the product @xmath57 comes mainly from the intrinsic growth rate @xmath49 of the sequences or from the effective fidelity @xmath22 does not have an observable influence on the dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> discussion    the good agreement between our analytical model and our simulation results demonstrates that rna sequences evolving on a neutral network of identical secondary structure folds are well described by only two parameters , their intrinsic replication rate @xmath50 and their effective copy fidelity @xmath3 . in the particular context of two competing distinct folds , </S>",
    "<S> we find furthermore that only the product of @xmath50 and @xmath3 is of importance . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , it follows from eq .   that the ratio between @xmath5 and @xmath53 depends only on the respective products of @xmath50 and @xmath3 , but not on the individual values themselves .    </S>",
    "<S> unlike the intrinsic replication rate @xmath50 , which is a property of the individual , the effective fidelity @xmath3 is a group property , as it is given by the average over all sequences in the population of the probability not to `` fall off '' the neutral network . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the regime in which @xmath3 dominates the evolutionary dynamics ( the phase of selection for robustness in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phases ] ) , the evolutionary success of an individual sequence depends strongly on the properties of the group it belongs to . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> we find that selection acts on the whole group of mutants , rather than on individuals , despite the absence of standard factors supporting group selection such as spatial subdivision of the population  , altruistic behavior , parental care  , or mutual catalytic support  . here </S>",
    "<S> , a sequence with a comparatively high neutrality embedded into a neutral network with a poor overall connection density will be at a disadvantage with respect to a sequence with a comparatively low neutrality that is , however , part of a neutral network with high connection density . </S>",
    "<S> the overall higher fidelity of a population on the second network results in a larger fraction of sequences that actually reside on the network , which in turn increases the chance that a particular sequence will be generated as mutant offspring from some other sequence . noted that this type of group selection should follow from the quasispecies equations , and that populations under this type of selection would be best described by an effective group replication rate @xmath63 . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that this is indeed the case , and we can also derive @xmath63 ( which is simply @xmath64 ) from the quasispecies equations . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the fact that the population neutrality @xmath0 ( which determines @xmath3 ) is given by the largest eigenvalue of the connection matrix of neutral genotypes is a direct consequence of the quasispecies equations  .    </S>",
    "<S> were the first to point out that at high mutation rates , the quasispecies around the highest peak in the landscape can disappear . </S>",
    "<S> they focused on situations in which the highest and the second - highest peak in a landscape were of almost equal height , while the immediate mutational neighborhood of the second peak was less deleterious than the one of the first peak . as a consequence , their results seemed to imply that the phase of selection of robustness was only important in the case of very similar peaks . our results , on the other hand , show that the difference in peak hight can be dramatic , if balanced by an equally dramatic difference in robustness .    </S>",
    "<S> while our analytical results apply strictly speaking only to infinite populations , we have seen that in simulations for population sizes as small as @xmath65 , the differential equation approach works well . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in our experiments on the probability of fixation , we have seen that even very small numbers of the advantageous group ( in the extreme only a single sequence ) can rise to fixation , despite their intrinsic replication rate being smaller than that of the currently dominating group . </S>",
    "<S> this result seems somewhat unintuitive at first , but can be easily understood . </S>",
    "<S> the most important aspect of every fixation event is the very first replication of the new genotype , and the smaller its selective advantage , the more likely it is not to replicate even once . now </S>",
    "<S> , if a new mutant with a poor replication rate @xmath66 but high effective fidelity @xmath67 arises in a population that is dominated by sequences with large intrinsic replication rate , we would intuitively assume that the mutant will hardly ever replicate even once , and therefore will never get a chance to employ its superior fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not correct if the effective fidelity of the dominating sequences , @xmath68 , is low . from eq .  , we find that the concentration of sequences that actually replicate is given by @xmath68 . therefore , even though the sequences that replicate do so at a high rate , the actual number of births that occur is small , comparable to the one in a population in which all individuals reproduce with rate @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the newly introduced genotype is relatively safe from being washed out prematurely , and fixation takes place at the predicted rate .    conclusions    we have demonstrated that for a population in a landscape where neutral mutants abound , the product of intrinsic replication rate @xmath50 and effective copy - fidelity @xmath3 is being maximized under selection , rather than the intrinsic replication rate alone . </S>",
    "<S> this observation has led to the natural distinction between two modes of selection , one in which intrinsic replication rate is favored , and one in which robustness ( high @xmath3 ) is more important . in the latter phase , the success of a single sequence depends strongly on the mutant cloud the sequence belongs to . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus demonstrate that the unit of selection in molecular evolution is indeed the quasispecies , as proposed by , and not the individual replicating sequence . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the probability of fixation of a single advantageous mutant in an established quasispecies can be predicted accurately with results from standard population genetics , provided we consider the overall growth rates of the established quasispecies and the quasispecies potentially formed by the mutant , rather than the replication rates of mutant and established wild type . </S>"
