    "heavy - ion fusion reactions are an important probe to investigate the fundamental features of the macroscopic tunneling for many - body quantum systems .",
    "the coulomb barrier is formed when a projectile approaches a target , because of the strong cancellation between the coulomb repulsion and nuclear attractive forces .",
    "fusion occurs when the projectile penetrates through this coulomb barrier .",
    "the fusion reaction at incident energies around the coulomb barrier is called the sub - barrier fusion reaction .",
    "an important observation of the sub - barrier fusion reactions is that the measured fusion cross sections exhibit strong enhancements compared to estimations using a simple one - dimensional model @xcite .",
    "these enhancements have been accounted for in terms of strong couplings between the relative motion of colliding nuclei and the intrinsic degrees of freedom , such as the collective vibrations of the target and/or projectile . in this context , the coupled - channels ( cc ) model based on this picture has been successful in describing these enhancements @xcite .    because of recent progress in experimental techniques , it is possible to precisely measure the fusion cross sections down to extremely low incident energies , the so - called `` deep sub - barrier energies '' .",
    "the experimental data revealed that significant decreases in the fusion cross sections at deep sub - barrier energies , compared to the standard cc calculations , emerge in a wide range of reaction systems @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "these significant decreases in the fusion cross section are often referred to as fusion hindrance .",
    "below , the incident energy for which the fusion hindrance starts to emerge is referred to as `` the incident threshold energy for fusion hindrance '' .    a key quantity for understanding the fusion hindrance is the potential energy at the touching point @xmath10 , which strongly correlates with the incident threshold energy for fusion hindrance @xcite .",
    "when the incident energy is lower than @xmath10 , the inner turning point of the potential energy becomes inside the touching point ( see fig .  [ spic ] ) .",
    "namely , the projectile is still in a classically forbidden region when the two colliding nuclei touch with each other . as a result",
    ", the colliding nuclei must penetrate through a residual barrier with an overlapping configuration before fusion occurs .",
    "thus , the fusion hindrance would be associated with the dynamics in the overlapping region of the two colliding nuclei .    to describe the fusion hindrance associated with the dynamics in the overlapping region , two approaches with different assumptions that contradict one",
    "another have been proposed @xcite .",
    "one is the sudden approach proposed by miicu and esbensen @xcite , which assumes that fusion occurs rapidly .",
    "they considered the pauli principle effect that acts when two colliding nuclei overlap one another .",
    "thus , they constructed a heavy ion - ion potential with a shallow potential pocket based on the frozen - density approximation .",
    "they systematically investigated various reaction systems to test the performance of the sudden model @xcite .",
    "the other is the adiabatic approach proposed by ichikawa _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which assumes that fusion slowly occurs and that neck formation between two colliding nuclei occurs in the overlapping region . in these considerations",
    ", the sudden and adiabatic processes are smoothly jointed by phenomenologically introducing a damping factor in the coupling form factor to avoid double counting of the cc effects .",
    "later , it was shown that the physical origin of this damping factor is the damping of quantum vibrations near the touching point of two colliding nuclei using the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) method for the @xmath8o + @xmath8o , @xmath3ca + @xmath3ca , and @xmath8o + @xmath9pb systems @xcite .",
    "another approach , different from the cc model , has recently been developed to describe heavy - ion fusion reactions based on self - consistent mean - field theory @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the time - dependent hatree - fock ( tdhf ) method is often used to extract an adiabatic heavy ion - ion potential .",
    "umar and oberacker proposed the density - constrained tdhf method and demonstrated the energy - dependent heavy ion - ion potential with inertia mass relative to the center - of - mass distance between two colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "although in this approach , any input parameters are not required to calculate fusion cross sections once one determines an energy - density functional , its mechanism for the fusion hindrance is still unclear .    in this paper ,",
    "i systematically investigate the fusion hindrance using the adiabatic approach to test the model s performance in various reaction systems .",
    "later , i show that the adiabatic approach works very well in many systems , strongly indicating that indeed the smooth transition from sudden to adiabatic processes occurs in deep sub - barrier fusion reactions , i.e.  this coordinate - dependent coupling strength is responsible for the fusion hindrance .",
    "i also show that a difference between the adiabatic and sudden models appears in the average angular momentum of compound nuclei .",
    "i also discuss the strong correlation between @xmath10 and the incident threshold energy for fusion hindrance .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , i describe the theoretical framework and how to construct a heavy ion - ion potential . in section iii",
    ", i present the results of the systematic calculations by applying the adiabatic approach for the medium - heavy , medium - light , and mass - asymmetric systems . in section iv",
    ", i discuss the average angular momentum of compound nuclei calculated with the adiabatic and sudden models , and the correlation between @xmath10 and the threshold incident energy for activating the fusion hindrance .",
    "i summarize my studies in section v.",
    "between colliding nuclei . the solid circle and square indicate the touching point of the colliding nuclei and its compound state , respectively .",
    "the gray area represents the overlapping region of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines indicate the potential energy curves for the adiabatic and sudden processes , respectively . ,",
    "width=264 ]    here , i discuss how to describe the fusion hindrance based on the adiabatic approach and show a concept of smooth transition from sudden to adiabatic processes .",
    "an important aspect of fusion reactions at deep sub - barrier incident energies is that the inner turning point of a heavy ion - ion potential would be located deep within the touching point of the colliding nuclei .",
    "figure [ spic ] shows a schematic picture of a heavy ion - ion potential versus incident energies in a fusion reaction .",
    "the solid line indicates a potential energy curve in the two - body region .",
    "the solid circle indicates the potential energy at the touching point @xmath10 of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the gray area represents the overlapping region of the colliding nuclei . at incident energies around the coulomb barrier , the inner turning point is still far outside of the touching point [ line ( i ) in fig .",
    "[ spic ] ] . at these energies",
    ", one usually assumes that a compound nucleus is automatically formed once the projectile penetrates the coulomb barrier because of strong nuclear attractive forces in the classically allowed region . on the other hand , at incident energies below @xmath10 ,",
    "the inner turning point appears more deeply within the touching point [ line ( ii ) in fig .",
    "[ spic ] ] .",
    "namely , the projectile is still in the classically forbidden region when the colliding nuclei touch one another .    after touching ,",
    "a composite system is formed , which evolves in the classically forbidden region toward its compound state by overlapping between projectile- and target - like nuclei . since this involves the penetration of a residual coulomb barrier , fusion cross sections are naturally hindered by the tunneling factor . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a strong correlation between @xmath10 and the incident threshold energy for fusion hindrance is found by systematically investigating various experimental data .",
    "thus , the dynamics after the nuclei collide plays an essential role in significantly decreasing the fusion cross section at deep sub - barrier incident energies .",
    "a description for the evolution toward the compound state strongly depends on which model is employed in the overlapping region .",
    "there are mainly two assumptions that contradict one another .",
    "one is the sudden approach , where fusion rapidly occurs . here",
    ", the potential energy curve would have a shallow potential pocket due to the strong overlapping of the two colliding nuclei [ dotted line in fig .",
    "[ spic ] ] .",
    "the other is the adiabatic approach , where the density distribution of the composite system evolves with the lowest energy configuration [ dashed line in fig .",
    "[ spic ] ] . in this paper ,",
    "i focus on applying the adiabatic process to the standard cc model framework .",
    "however , one can not directly apply the adiabatic potential calculated with the lowest energy configuration to the standard cc model , because its direct application leads to double counting of the cc effects .",
    "channel coupling already includes many effects of the adiabatic process , including neck formation between the colliding nuclei . to avoid such double counting",
    ", i developed a full quantum mechanical model , whereby the cc effect in the two - body system is smoothly jointed to the adiabatic potential tunneling for the one - body system .    in the cc calculations ,",
    "one often employs the incoming wave boundary condition in order to simulate a compound nucleus formation . to construct an adiabatic potential model with it ,",
    "i assume the following conditions : ( 1 ) before the target and projectile touch one another , the standard cc model in the two - body system works well ; ( 2 ) after the target and projectile appreciably overlap one another , the fusion process is governed by a single adiabatic one - body potential , whereby the excitation on the adiabatic base is neglected ; and ( 3 ) the transition from the two- to one - body treatments occurs near the touching point , where all physical quantities are smoothly joined .",
    "these are the important conditions , which should be taken into account in the adiabatic approach under the framework of the cc model .      before describing an extension of the standard cc model , taking into account the adiabatic process ,",
    "i first briefly describe the standard cc model ( for details see refs .",

    "a bare nuclear potential @xmath22 consisting of the coulomb and nuclear interactions is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the matrix elements of the coupling hamiltonian @xmath24 are calculated with the collective model including the coulomb and nuclear components .",
    "the cc equations are solved by imposing the incoming wave boundary condition @xcite at the minimum of the potential pocket @xmath25 inside the coulomb barrier .",
    "this condition is expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the @xmath28 matrix , @xmath29 are the transmission coefficients , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the outgoing and incoming coulomb wave functions , respectively .",

    "<S> background : :    at extremely low incident energies , unexpected decreases in fusion    cross sections , compared to the standard coupled - channels ( cc )    calculations , have been observed in a wide range of fusion reactions .    </S>",
    "<S> these significant reductions of the fusion cross sections are often    referred to as the fusion hindrance . </S>",
    "<S> however , the physical origin of    the fusion hindrance is still unclear . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    to describe the fusion hindrance based on an adiabatic approach , i    propose a novel extension of the standard cc model by introducing a    damping factor that describes a smooth transition from sudden to    adiabatic processes . </S>",
    "<S> i demonstrate the performance of this model by    systematically investigating various deep sub - barrier fusion    reactions . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    i extend the standard cc model by introducing a damping factor into    the coupling matrix elements in the standard cc model . </S>",
    "<S> this avoids    double counting of the cc effects , when two colliding nuclei overlap    one another . </S>",
    "<S> i adopt the yukawa - plus - exponential ( ype ) model as a    basic heavy ion - ion potential , which is advantageous for a unified    description of the one- and two - body potentials . for the purpose of    these systematic investigations , </S>",
    "<S> i approximate the one - body potential    with a third - order polynomial function based on the ype model . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    calculated fusion cross sections for the medium - heavy mass systems of    @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni , @xmath1ni +    @xmath1ni , and @xmath1ni +    @xmath2fe , the medium - light mass systems of    @xmath3ca + @xmath3ca , @xmath4ca +    @xmath4ca , and @xmath5 mg +    @xmath6si , and the mass - asymmetric systems of    @xmath4ca + @xmath7zr and @xmath8o    + @xmath9pb are consistent with the experimental data </S>",
    "<S> .    the astrophysical s factor and logarithmic derivative representations    of these are also in good agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the    values obtained for the individual radius and diffuseness parameters    in the damping factor , which reproduce the fusion cross sections well ,    are nearly equal to the average value for all the systems . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    since the results calculated with the damping factor are in excellent    agreement with the experimental data in all systems , i conclude that    the smooth transition from the sudden to adiabatic processes occurs    and that a coordinate - dependent coupling strength is responsible for    the fusion hindrance . in all systems , </S>",
    "<S> the potential energies at the    touching point @xmath10 strongly correlate with the    incident threshold energies for which the fusion hindrance starts to    emerge , except for the medium - light mass systems . </S>"
