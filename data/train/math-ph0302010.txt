    "electrorheological fluids are smart materials which are concentrated suspensions of polarizable particles in a nonconducting dielectric liquid . in moderately large electric fields , the particles form chains along the field lines , and these chains then aggregate to form columns ( see fig .",
    "[ figfibstruc ] , taken from @xcite ) .",
    "these chainlike and columnar structures cause dramatic changes in the rheological properties of the suspensions .",
    "the fluids become anisotropic , the apparent viscosity ( the resistance to flow ) in the direction orthogonal to the direction of electric field abruptly increases , while the apparent viscosity in the direction of the electric field changes not so drastically .",
    "the chainlike and columnar structures are destroyed under the action of large stresses , and then the apparent viscosity of the fluid decreases and the fluid becomes less anisotropic .",
    "constitutive relations for electrorheological fluids in which the stress tensor @xmath0 is an isotropic function of the vector of electric field strength @xmath1 and the rate of strain tensor @xmath2 were derived in @xcite , and for an incompressible fluid there was obtained the following equation : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the pressure , @xmath5 the unit tensor , @xmath6 are scalar functions of six invariants of the tensors @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and mixed tensors ; @xmath8 are to be determined by experiments .    in the condition of simple shear flow ,",
    "when the vectors of velocity @xmath9 and electric field @xmath1 are orthogonal and @xmath1 is in the plane of flow , the terms with coefficients @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 give rise to two normal stresses differences ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but these terms lead to incorrectness of the boundary value problems for the constitutive equation , and very restrictive conditions should be imposed on the coefficients @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 in order to get an operator satisfying the conditions of coerciveness and monotonicity ( the condition of coerciveness is almost similar to the clausius - duhem inequality following from the second law of thermodynamics , and the condition of monotonicity denotes that stresses increase as the rate of strains increase ) .",
    "the constitutive equation does not describe anisotropy of the fluid ; in the case of simple shear flow gives the same values of the shear stresses in the cases , when the vectors of velocity and electric field are orthogonal and parallel ( @xmath0 is an isotropic function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in ) .    stationary and nonstationary mathematical problems for the special case of are studied in @xcite .",
    "it is supposed in @xcite that velocities are equal to zero everywhere on the boundary and the stress tensor is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the dimension of a domain of flow , @xmath17 , are constants , and @xmath18 is a function of @xmath19 .    the constants @xmath17 and the function @xmath18 are determined by the approximation of flow curves which are obtained experimentally for different values of the vector of electric field @xmath1 ( see subsection 2.2 ) .",
    "but the conditions of coerciveness and monotonicity of the operator @xmath20 impose severe constraints on the constants @xmath17 and on the function @xmath18 , see @xcite , such that with these restrictions one can not obtain a good approximation of a flow curve , to say nothing of approximation of a set of flow curves corresponding to different values of @xmath1 .",
    " ( .18 * -.08 ) @xmath21 +  ( .74 * -.08 ) @xmath22 +    below in section 2 , we develop a constitutive equation of electrorheological fluids such that a fluid is considered as a viscous one with the viscosity depending on the second invariant of the rate of strain tensor , on the module of the vector of electric field strength , and on the angle between the vectors of velocity and electric field strength .",
    "this constitutive equation describes the main peculiarities of electrorheological fluids , and it can be identified so that a set of flow curves corresponding to different values of @xmath1 is approximated with a high degree of accuracy , and it leads to correct mathematical problems .    in section 3 , we present auxiliary results , and in sections 48 we study problems on stationary flow of such fluids at nonhomogeneous mixed boundary conditions .",
    "here we prescribe values of velocities and surface forces on different parts of the boundary and ignore the inertial forces .",
    "the cases where the viscosity function is continuous and singular , equal to infinity , when the second invariant of the rate of strain tensor is equal to zero , are studied . in the second case",
    "the problem is reduced to a variational inequality .    by using the methods of a fixed point , monotonicity , and compactness we prove existence results for the regular and singular viscosity functions . in the second case existence results",
    "are obtained at more restrictive assumptions . here the singular viscosity is approximated by a continuous bounded one with a parameter of regularization , and a solution of the variational inequality is obtained as a limit of the solutions of regularized problems .",
    "section 9 is concerned with numerical solution of the problems on stationary flows of electrorheological fluids with regular viscosity function .",
    "we consider here methods of the augmented lagrangian , birger - kachanov , contraction and gradient .",
    "in sections 10 and 11 we study problems on flow of electrorheological fluids in which inertial forces are taken into account .",
    "here we consider nonhomogeneous boundary conditions in the case that velocities are given on the whole of the boundary and in the case that velocities and surface forces are prescribed on different parts of the boundary . with some suppositions",
    "existence results are proved .",
    "it has been found experimentally that the shear stress and accordingly the viscosity of electrorheological fluids depend on the shear rate , the module of the vector of electric field strength , and the angle between the vectors of fluid velocity and electric fields strength ( see @xcite ) .",

    "thus , we get that the function @xmath907 is a solution of the problem . now from lemma 3.5 it follows that there exists a function @xmath384 such that the pair @xmath835 is a solution of the problem .",
