    "<S> we identify the operational conditions for maximum power of a nanothermoelectric engine consisting of a single quantum level embedded between two leads at different temperatures and chemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding thermodynamic efficiency agrees with the curzon - ahlborn expression up to quadratic terms in the gradients , supporting the thesis of universality beyond linear response .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of electron transport through a single quantum dot connecting two leads at different temperatures and chemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest to us is the efficiency of the thermal motor function , in which electrons are pumped upward in chemical potential under the impetus of a downward temperature gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the study of this model addresses several issues of timely interest : nanotechnology , the study of thermodynamic properties of small devices that are prone to fluctuations , the question of universality for thermodynamic properties away from equilibrium , the role of quantum features in this respect , and the promise of thermoelectricity generated by nano - devices . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly comment on each of these topics .    </S>",
    "<S> spectacular technical and experimental progress in nano- and biotechnology have greatly increased our ability to observe , manipulate , control , and even manufacture systems on a very small scale  @xcite . in parallel , new theoretical tools and concepts have been developed that make it possible to exhibit the deeper relationship between fluctuations , entropy production and work , and the role of stochasticity in small scale non - linear nonequilibrium phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , stochastic thermodynamics formulates the thermodynamics of small entities subject to thermal fluctuations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these developments are closely related to the celebrated fluctuation  @xcite and work theorems  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of carnot efficiency is a central cornerstone of thermodynamics . according to this principle , the efficiency , defined as the ratio of work output over heat input for a machine operating between two thermal baths at temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is at most equal to @xmath3 the equality </S>",
    "<S> is only reached for reversible operation . </S>",
    "<S> this is a universal result which remains valid for small scale fluctuating systems such as the well - documented case of brownian motors , see  @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> however , reversible processes require infinitely slow operation , implying that such engines produce zero power . </S>",
    "<S> one of the important questions , when operating away from equilibrium , is the efficiency at maximum power . in a groundbreaking paper , curzon and ahlborn  @xcite calculated this efficiency for the carnot engine in the so - called endo - reversible approximation ( taking into account the dissipation only in the heat transfer process ) . </S>",
    "<S> they found a strikingly simple formula , namely @xmath4 recently , it has been shown that the curzon - ahlborn efficiency is an exact consequence of _ linear _ irreversible thermodynamics when operating under conditions of strong coupling between the heat flux and the work  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath5 for the linear coefficient in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ca ] ) is therefore universal for such systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency at maximum power was also addressed in the context of stochastic thermodynamics in  @xcite , where it was shown that the efficiency at maximum power for a brownian particle undergoing a carnot cycle through the modulation of a harmonic potential is given by @xmath6 . by an entirely different calculation , dealing with the feynman ratchet and pawl model ( which operates under steady rather than cyclic conditions ) , the efficiency at maximum power was found to be  @xcite @xmath7\\approx \\eta_c/2+\\eta_c^2/8 + 7 \\eta_c^3/96+\\ldots$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> all three of the above results agree , as they should  @xcite , to linear order in @xmath8 . more surprisingly , the coefficient of the quadratic term is also identical . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question as to whether universality also applies to the coefficient of the quadratic term .    </S>",
    "<S> the field of thermoelectricity went through a revival in the early 1990s due to the discovery of new thermoelectric materials with significantly higher thermodynamic yields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest are the developments in the context of nanostructured materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , thermoelectric experiments have been reported on silicon nanowires  @xcite , individual carbon nanotubes  @xcite and molecular junctions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been reported that carnot efficiency can be reached for electron transport between two leads at different temperatures and chemical potentials , by connecting them through a channel sharply tuned at the energy for which the electron density is the same in both leads  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a double - barrier resonant tunneling structure has been proposed as a possible technological implementation  @xcite .    the thermoelectric device whose properties we explore below is arguably the simplest prototype of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a quantum dot with a single resonant energy level in contact with two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plot0 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the dot can contain one single electron with a sharply defined energy @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange of electrons between the leads through the dot will be described by a stochastic master equation  @xcite , and the corresponding thermodynamic properties can be obtained from stochastic thermodynamics  @xcite . in anticipation of the forthcoming analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we note that this model displays perfect coupling between energy and matter flow : because of the sharply defined dot energy , every single electron carries exactly the same amount of energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , carnot efficiency will be reached when operating close to equilibrium  @xcite , while curzon - ahlborn efficiency will be obtained at maximum power in the regime of linear response  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> going beyond these results , we will identify the operational conditions for working at maximum power . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the efficiency at maximum power will be found to be @xmath10 , with the coefficient of @xmath11 again equal to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides further support for the thesis of universality for this value , especially since the regime of maximum power is found to lie entirely in the quantum regime .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the mathematical analysis of the thermoelectric engine represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plot0 ] . a single level quantum dot , with orbital energy @xmath9 , exchanges electrons with a cold left lead , temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath13 , and with a hot right lead , temperature @xmath1 and chemical potential @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dot is either empty ( state @xmath15 ) or filled ( state @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial variables of the problem are the scaled energy barriers ( with @xmath17 ) @xmath18 the exchange of electrons with the leads is described by the following quantum master equation  @xcite : @xmath19 the rates are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath22 is independent of the dot energies is known as the wide band approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the properties of the device at the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the steady state distributions for the dot occupation follow from @xmath23 with @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting probability current from the lead @xmath25 to the dot is then @xmath26 using @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we can rewrite the result for the flux from the right lead as @xmath29 where @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ir ] ) is essentially the landauer formula for a single channel .    </S>",
    "<S> the steady state heat per unit time @xmath31 extracted from the lead @xmath32 , and the steady state work per unit time ( power ) @xmath33 performed by the device upon bringing electrons from right to left lead , are respectively given by : @xmath34 the corresponding thermodynamic efficiency reads @xmath35    the entropy production associated with the master equation ( [ matereq2by2 ] ) is given by  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 . noting that @xmath38=x_{\\nu}$ ] , one finds , in agreement with standard irreversible thermodynamics  @xcite , the following expression for the entropy production : @xmath39 with thermodynamic forces for matter and energy flow , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , given by @xmath42 we stress that the corresponding matter and heat flow , given by @xmath43 are proportional to each other . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> matter and heat flow are perfectly coupled and the condition for attaining both carnot and curzon - ahlborn efficiency , namely , that the determinant of the corresponding onsager matrix be zero , is fulfilled  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we first discuss the case of equilibrium . due to the perfect coupling </S>",
    "<S> , it is enough to stop one current , matter or energy , and the other one will automatically vanish . under this condition , </S>",
    "<S> detailed balance is valid , @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ir ] ) that the matter flux ( and hence also the energy flux ) vanishes if and only if @xmath45 or , equivalently , @xmath46 . the efficiency then becomes equal to carnot efficiency , cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defeffi ] ) , and the entropy production vanishes , @xmath47 [ cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ep ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath46 does not require that the thermodynamic forces @xmath40 and @xmath41 vanish separately , i.e. , at this singular balancing point equilibrium does not require temperature and chemical potential to be identical in both reservoirs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we next turn to the operational condition for maximum power . for given temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we search for the values of the scaled electron energy barriers @xmath48 and @xmath49 that maximize @xmath33 . from @xmath50 , we find the following two equations determining these values : @xmath51f_r^2 { { \\rm e}}^{x_r}=0 \\\\ ( f_l - f_r)+\\big(\\frac{x_r}{1-\\eta_c}- x_l\\big ) f_l^2 { { \\rm e}}^{x_l}=0 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{2equ2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a first observation is that these equations depend only on the ratio of the two temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> second , while the equations involve transcendental relations , one obtains the following explicit result by subtracting the first equation from the second , @xmath52.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substitution of this result in ( [ 2equ1 ] ) gives @xmath53 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{0.5cm}+ \\cosh ( x_r)=0 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{bigeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since an analytic solution of this equation is not possible , we first turn to perturbative solutions for @xmath8 close to the limiting values @xmath54 ( reservoirs of equal temperatures ) and @xmath15 ( cold reservoir at zero temperature ) . for the case @xmath55 , we substitute @xmath56 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bigeq ] ) and expand the resulting equation in @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath58 , etc . , are found recursively by solving order by order in @xmath8 . at order zero </S>",
    "<S> , we find an identity . at first order </S>",
    "<S> , we find the transcendental equation @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical solution is @xmath60 . at second order and third order in @xmath8 , we find @xmath61 and @xmath62\\right\\}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> substitution of these results and ( [ isolatexl ] ) in ( [ defeffi ] ) leads to the following expansion of the efficiency at maximum power in the regime of small @xmath8 : @xmath63}{96 } \\eta_c^3 + { \\cal o}(\\eta_c^4 ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expansion features the expected coefficient @xmath5 for the linear term , but also supports the thesis that the coefficient of @xmath11 has a universal value , namely , @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> we next turn to the analysis of the case @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . as we will see by self - consistency </S>",
    "<S> , the value of @xmath49 converges to a finite limiting value . with this a posteriori insight </S>",
    "<S> , we can easily identify the leading behavior of @xmath48 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ isolatexl ] ) , namely , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> substitution of this result in ( [ 2equ1 ] ) leads to the conclusion that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a solution of the transcendental equation @xmath69 with numerical solution @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding efficiency converges to @xmath15 , albeit rather slowly , cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defeffi ] ) .    to complete the picture </S>",
    "<S> , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plot1 ] the numerical solutions for @xmath48 and @xmath49 as functions of @xmath8 as well as the corresponding rescaled maximum power @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath49 is always of order unity , so that the regime of maximum power can not be well described by either a high or a low temperature expansion . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be seen that the maximum power is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding efficiency is reproduced in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plot2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is very close to the curzon - ahlborn efficiency , with relative deviations largest for large @xmath8 . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> nanosystems with perfectly coupled fluxes , such as the quantum dot described here , are of great interest . </S>",
    "<S> they can operate as steady state carnot engines . </S>",
    "<S> they probably possess universal features up to quadratic terms in nonlinear response when working at maximum power . </S>",
    "<S> one can speculate that they offer , from a technological point of view , advantages over their macroscopic counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis can be repeated for the quantum dot operating as a refrigerator , corresponding to the regime @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis reveals that maximum cooling power ( maximum @xmath31 extracted from the cold lead ) is attained for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath68 is again the solution to the transcendental equation ( [ teb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding cooling power is thus @xmath75 per transported particle , to be compared with the cooling power of @xmath0 for a classical engine .    </S>",
    "<S> if we use the high temperature expansion of the fermi distribution @xmath76 in the expression for the power ( [ defworkextr ] ) , we can solve @xmath50 , and put the only physical solution in ( [ defeffi ] ) ( i did it analytically with mathematica ) . by expanding in powers of @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath77 </S>"
