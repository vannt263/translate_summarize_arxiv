    "absorbed ( type 2 ) agn have been proposed as the major contributors to the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) above 2 kev ( see among others setti and woltjer , 1989 ; madau , ghisellini and fabian , 1994 ; comastri et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , recent results from asca and beppo - sax observations ( akiyama et al . , 1998a ; bassani et al.,1999 ; risaliti , maiolino and salvati , 1999 ; fiore et al . , 1999 ) seem to favor this hypothesis but deeper investigations are still needed to confirm and refine this scenario and to test competing models . for example it is not clear if high luminosity type 2 agn exist or not ( see e.g. halpern , turner and george , 1999 ; akiyama et al . , 1998a ) or if a significant fraction of the hard cxb deriving from star - burst and star - forming galaxies at moderate redshift can be excluded or not ( see e.g. moran , lehnert and helfand , 1999 ) .    at the _ osservatorio astronomico di brera _",
    ", with the specific aim of extending to faint fluxes the census of the x - ray sources shining in the hard x - ray sky , we have initiated a few years ago the asca hard serendipitous survey ( hss : see della ceca at al .",
    ", 1999a for a progress update ) : a systematic search for sources in the @xmath10 kev band , using data from the gis2 instrument on board the asca satellite ( tanaka , inoue and holt , 1994 ) .",
    "this effort has lead to a  pilot \" sample of 60 sources ( cagnoni , della ceca and maccacaro , 1998 ) whose spectral properties have been presented and discussed by della ceca at al . , (",
    "the asca hss has been extended and it now covers @xmath11 deg@xmath12 of sky .",
    "the resulting source sample consists of 189 sources detected with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath13 ( della ceca at al .",
    ", 1999a , 2000 ) , a more restrictive criterion than that used in cagnoni , della ceca and maccacaro , 1998 where a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath14 was used .    in this paper we report the serendipitous discovery of a low luminosity type 2 agn : axj2254 + 1146 .",
    "its absorbed type 2 nature has been revealed by the x - ray data alone , thanks to the good spectral resolution of the asca gis ( @xmath15 at @xmath16 kev ) .",
    "we are convinced that the new generation of x - ray telescopes ( e.g. chandra , xmm ) will make axj2254 + 1146 only the first one of several objects whose nature will be discovered by means of the x - ray data alone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the x - ray data and discuss the x - ray spectral properties of axj2254 + 1146 . in section 3",
    "we present its optical identification ( ugc 12237 ) , while in section 4 we discuss the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source and compare it with the sed of seyfert 2 and non - agn spiral galaxies .",
    "an optical spectrum of ugc 12237 is shown and discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , summary and conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we adopt @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 and @xmath19 throughout .",
    "axj2254 + 1146 was discovered in the asca gis field 74076000 pointed at the radio loud quasar pks2251 + 113 ( @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; z=0.323 ) .",
    "the field is one of the many used to extend the survey of cagnoni , della ceca and maccacaro 1998 ; data preparation and analysis have been discussed in detail therein and in della ceca et al .",
    "this source attracted our attention because its hardness ratios ( hr1 = @xmath23 ; hr2 = @xmath24 ) ] where s , m and h are the corrected net counts in the 0.7 - 2.0 , 2.0 - 4.0 and 4.0 - 10.0 kev energy band respectively ( cf .",

    "three sources are clearly visible in the 2 - 10 kev band   pks2251 + 113 ) , plus two serendipitous sources , axj2254 + 1141 and axj2254 + 1146 . axj2254 +",
    "1141 is identified with ms2252.2 + 1126 , a type 1 agn at z=0.0281 ( stocke et al . , 1991 , maccacaro et al , 1994 ) .",

    "axj2254 + 1146 stands out as a very hard source compared to the other ones .    in table 1",
    "the x - ray position , the optical position and the offset between the two ( x - ray - optical ) are listed for the three sources previously mentioned . the measured offsets are consistent with the positional uncertainties of the asca gis images radius , while in the case of the xrt+gis additional instrumental and calibration uncertainties can produce larger errors . from the analysis of a sample of 168 point - like asca targets within the data set used for the asca hss we have estimated a 90% confidence level error circle of @xmath26 arcmin radius . ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in figure 4 we show the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ugc12237 : the filled dots represent the photometric data from radio to optical wavelengths while the tick solid line represents the @xmath27 kev best fit spectral model reported in table 2 . also shown in figure 5 is the mean sed of a sample of seyfert 2 and a sample of non - agn spiral galaxies as determined by schmitt et al .",
    "the seds have been normalized at @xmath28 2 kev .",
    "it is clear from figure 4 that the mean sed of non - agn spiral galaxies is at variance with the sed of axj2254 + 1146 , while the sed of seyfert 2 galaxies seem to be more consistent with the data .",
    "the largest discrepancy between the seyfert 2 sed and the sed of axj2254 + 1146 is in the optical domain , where only the total magnitude ( nucleus + host galaxy ) is available ; this discrepancy is expected since the seds reported in schmitt et al . , 1997",
    "were based on the optical nuclear flux . in the far infrared regime",
    "schmitt et al . , 1997 use the iras fluxes as we have done for axj2254 + 1146 .",
    "while the paper was in the refereeing process an optical spectrum was obtained with vlt / fors in long slit mode as a backup program during a period of poor seeing .",
    "the exposure time was 5 minutes long and the slit ( @xmath29 wide ) was set perpendicular to the galaxy major axis .",
    "the grism 150i was used providing a resolution @xmath30 with little sensitivity below @xmath31 . the extracted spectrum ( fig.6 )",
    "shows h@xmath32 , [ oiii ] , [ oi ] , h@xmath33 , [ nii ] and [ sii ] narrow emission lines as well as absorption lines originating in the host galaxy , at redshift @xmath34 . the weak h@xmath35 line is likely partially obscured by blending with the stellar h@xmath35 absorption line .",
    "we estimate a flux ratio@xmath36~\\lambda 5007/\\rm{h_{\\beta } } > 3 $ ] . at",
    "the above stated spectral resolution , we also estimate a fwhm for all the observed emission lines less than @xmath37 km / s . together with the presence of a weak [ oi]@xmath38 line , these line features and ratios lend support to the identification of axj2254 + 1146 as a seyfert 2 , as opposed to a liner or starburst galaxy .",
    "in this paper we have reported the x - ray discovery of a type 2 agn - axj2254 + 1146 - which is part of the asca hard serendipitous survey ( della ceca et al .",
    ", 1999a , 2000 ) ; this object must be added to the scanty number of hard x - ray selected type 2 agn reported in literature ( see e.g. akiyama et al . , 1998b and reference therein ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is best described by a model consisting of an unresolved gaussian line at @xmath0 kev plus the so called  leaky - absorber \" continua .",
    "the best fit values of the absorbing column density ( @xmath4 = @xmath5 @xmath6 ) , of the line equivalent width ( @xmath7 kev ) and of the scattering fraction ( @xmath8 ) clearly reveal its type 2 nature .",
    "a fairly bright ( @xmath39 ) spiral galaxy ( ugc 12237 ) is present inside the asca error circle : this is the most probable optical counterpart of axj2254 + 1146 .",
    "subsequent optical spectroscopy has confirmed that ugc 12237 is a seyfert 2 at z=0.029 .    which are the most important implications of this finding ? as with many discovery of this kind we are probably seeing the  tip of the iceberg \" .",
    "as soon as the new generation of x - ray telescopes ( e.g. chandra , xmm ) is fully operative , we predict that it will become common to investigate and classify x - ray selected objects by using x - ray data alone ( see also rosati et al . , 1995 for a classification based on the source extent ) .",
    "axj2254 + 1146 could be indeed one of the brightest examples of a population of very hard x - ray sources that is showing up at faint fluxes ( cf .",
    "della ceca et al . , 1999a , b ) .",
    "the current optical identification status of the asca hss prevents us from speculating any further and discussing constraints on the synthesis models for the cxb .",
    "we only note here that in the asca hss sample there are about 8 more sources with broad band spectral properties ( as derived from the hardness ratios ) similar to those of axj2254 + 1146 .",
    "one of these 8 sources is ngc 6552 , a well known and studied seyfert 2 galaxy ( reynolds et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "finally , we recall that fabian and iwasawa ( 1999 ) have recently pointed out that if absorbed agns are the major contributors to the cxb above 2 kev then about 85% of the accretion power in the universe is absorbed . in axj2254",
    "+ 1146 about 99% ( 65% ) of the intrinsic flux in the 0.5 - 2.0 ( 2 -10 ) kev energy range is absorbed !",
