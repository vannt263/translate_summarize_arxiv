    "in perturbative qcd the structure functions can be expressed as a convolution of a perturbatively calculable coefficient , and a number of nonperturbative lt parton distributions and ht parton correlations . in particular , the ww relation can be obtained in the framework of collinear factorization @xcite or in transverse momentum dependent factorization , as we will shortly describe .",
    "let s define the quark - quark correlator @xmath25 where @xmath26 are dirac indices , @xmath27 is the quark flavor index , @xmath28 its 4-momentum , @xmath29 its fractional momentum and @xmath30 its transverse momentum relative to the parent nucleon .",

    "@xmath36 is a wilson line ( gauge link ) whose precise form depends on the process .",
    "the direction of the wilson line is determined by an additional 4-vector beside @xmath19 , which in tree - level analyses such as we pursue here is identified with the light - cone vector @xmath37 . in the light - cone",
    "gauge @xmath38 the wilson line is identically equal to 1 and @xmath39 nonetheless , the dependence on @xmath37 appears explicitly in the gauge field propagators and can not be in general neglected .    for any dirac matrix @xmath40",
    "we define the projection @xmath41 } = \\text{tr } [ \\gamma \\phi^a]/2 $ ] .",
    "the relevant tmds are defined as follows : @xmath42}(x,\\vec{k}_t ) & = s_l \\ , g_{1}^a(x,\\vec{k}_{t}^{2 } )       + \\frac{\\vec{k}_{t } \\cdot \\vec{s}_{t}}{m } \\ , g_{1t}^a(x,\\vec{k}_{t}^{2 } )   \\\\",

    "the dirac equations of motions for the quarks , and the lorentz invariance of the theory imply the following 2 relations between twist-2 and pure twist-3 functions : @xmath46 where for light quarks we can neglect the term proportional to the quark mass @xmath47 compared to a typical hadronic scale @xmath5 . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are pure twist-3 parton correlation functions ( pcf ) defined in terms of the quark - gluon - quark correlator , which in the light - cone gauge reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a transverse index , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the qcd field strength tensor .",

    "the pure twist-3 functions in eqs .  - are particular projections over @xmath58 of @xmath59 and @xmath60(pv denotes the principal value ) : @xmath61 and as such are sensitive to different parts of the quark - gluon - quark correlator .",
    "it is very important to find several such quantities , because physically it is only possible to measure @xmath11 but the full dependence on @xmath62 is needed , e.g. , to determine the qcd evolution of @xmath0 or to compute the high-@xmath14 tails of tmds .",
    "note also that since the integrand in eq .",

    "cottingham sum rule @xmath68 , which is not in general guaranteed in the ope  @xcite .",
    "a natural question is : how much is the ww relation broken ?",
    "model calculations have been used to repeatedly argue that the pure twist-3 terms are not necessarily small  @xcite . however , in the recent past , since the lir - breaking @xmath69 term was not considered in eq .   and",
    "the quark - mass term with @xmath70 was neglected , the breaking of the ww relation was considered to be a direct measurement of the pure twist-3 term @xmath71 . therefore , the presumed experimental validity of the ww relation , which we are presently going to challenge , was taken as evidence that @xmath71 is small .",
    "this observation was also typically generalized to assume that all pure twist-3 terms are small .",
    "our present analysis shows instead that , precisely due to the presence of @xmath69 , the measurement of the breaking of the ww relation does not offer anymore the possibility of measuring a single pure twist-3 matrix element , nor to generically infer its size . on the theory side , the quark - target model of refs .",
    "@xcite can be used to determine both @xmath71 and @xmath69 , which are both comparable in size to the the other twist-2 functions . on the experimental side , we used data on polarized dis on proton and neutron targets to fit the ww breaking term @xmath72 defined as the difference of the experimental data and @xmath73 : @xmath74 @xmath75 was determined using the lss06 leading twist @xmath22 parametrization @xcite , and @xmath24 fitted to a functional form allowing for a change in sign and satisfying the burkhardt  cottingham sum rule .",

    "for the neutron , due to the limited statistical significance of the low - x data , we limit ourselves to quoting the value of @xmath79 for the large-@xmath11 region , [ 0.15,1 ] .    in summary , we have found that the experimental data are compatible with a substantial breaking of the ww relation in the 15 - 40% range .",

    "but even if in the future the ww approximation is found to be more precise than in our analysis , we would only be able to conclude that @xmath83 this can clearly happen because either @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath84 are both small , or because they accidentally cancel each other . therefore no information can be obtained on the size of the twist-3 quark - gluon - quark term @xmath84 from the experimental data on @xmath0 alone .",

    "@xcite ) : @xmath87 in tmd factorization , @xmath86 is the first transverse moment of a twist-2 tmd .",
    "its experimental determination is challenging because it requires measuring a double spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive dis up to rather large hadron transverse momentum .",
    "furthermore , in the lir it appears differentiated in @xmath11 , which requires a rather fine @xmath11 binning .",
    "preliminary data from the e06 - 014 and sane ( e-07 - 003 ) experiments at jefferson lab will soon be available , and will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed measurement of @xmath69 and @xmath84 .",
    "this measurement is also very important because the eom , lir and ww relation breaking provide 3 independent measurement for 2 independent quantities . verifying them will constitute a pretty stringent test of tmd factorization and its connection to collinear factorization ."
