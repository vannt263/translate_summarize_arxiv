    "there we discuss the _ perplexing problem _ of the general - relativistic hydrogen spectrum , which ought to be interesting to most mathematical quantum physicists . yet another way to motivate our study  which is even more intriguing , but was not yet ready for public announcement at the time of the regensburg conference and is , therefore , only briefly mentioned here ( in the last section )  has meanwhile been made public in our paper @xcite .",
    "our results are stated informally in the context of the general - relativistic hydrogen problem at the end of the next section , while the precise statements and some technical details are given in section 3 . in section 4",

    "hydrogen has played a crucial role in the development of the quantum theory of atomic spectra , and presumably this simplest of the chemical atoms will continue to play an important role in the ongoing efforts to find a more satisfactory theory ; for instance , one that does not rely on artificial uv cutoffs , etc .",
    "yet we do not have to venture into the realm of quantum field theory or quantum gravity to encounter perplexing issues that await clarification .",

    "but one thing seems clear : none of these putative point spectra can be obtained perturbatively from sommerfeld s fine structure spectrum by `` switching on @xmath1 . ''",
    "in particular , the black hole point spectrum would presumably vanish as @xmath0 because the black hole itself vanishes in this limit , and so bear no resemblance to sommerfeld s fine structure spectrum as @xmath0 . and",

    "it assigns an infinite inertia to a point charge , which hounds one when trying to formulate a dynamical theory of charged point particle motion beyond the test particle approximation , but in a general - relativistic setting the gravitational coupling leads , in addition , to very strong curvature singularities of the spacetime generated by the non - integrable self - energy(-etc . )",
    "interestingly enough , for the remarkably accurate computation of the special - relativistic quantum - mechanical point spectrum of hydrogen ( in the born ",
    "oppenheimer approximation ) only the electrostatic interaction energy of a point proton and a point electron enters the dirac equation through the usual `` minimal coupling , '' i.e. both self - energy terms are ignored .",
    "these self - energy terms are also ignored in the electromagnetic minimal coupling term of dirac s equation on a reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetime .",
    "but the electric self - energy density of the point proton enters the general - relativistic dirac equation of a point electron in the reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetime also through the covariant derivatives of the spacetime , for this non - integrable density is a curvature source term in the einstein ",

    "so one may contemplate purging it , too .",
    "this leads to the vacuum einstein equations , and so instead of the reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetime one would obtain the schwarzschild spacetime ; see @xcite for a recent pedagogical treatment .",
    "yet to retain the electrostatic interaction between point electron and proton in the dirac hamiltonian , consistent with this approximation one would next have to solve the maxwell equations with a point proton as source in a schwarzschild background spacetime , with the point proton located in its `` center ''  if this makes any sense at all  and then treat the dirac point electron as a test charge experiencing the uncharged background metric as well as the electric field of the point proton imposed on that background metric .",
    "we are not aware of any such study ; furthermore , we are not sure whether a mathematically well - posed formulation of the indicated classical electrical problem is feasible because the schwarzschild black hole spacetime is not static inside its event horizon , and its singularity is spacelike , so that its `` center '' is a spacelike line , not a point , raising the question where exactly to place the point proton !",
    "yet it may be mathematically interesting to sort this out .",
    "@xmath35    we close this subsection by emphasizing that the just contemplated removal of the self - energy density of the point proton from the spacetime equations is a rather contrived step and not easily justifiable  if at all  , in contrast to the readily vindicated omission of the infinite _ self - interaction _ terms from the _ electromagnetic energy _ in the hamiltonian .",
    "it has the flavor of `` a last desperate attempt '' to cling to the point proton approximation when setting up the general - relativistic hydrogen problem for a dirac `` test electron '' interacting with it .",
    "since a physical proton is a compound particle with a finite size , the mathematical catastrophes associated with the point proton approximation may well be dismissed as the result of an oversimplification and declared not a cause for real concern .",
    "indeed , since it is known that finite - size proton models remove the special - relativistic catastrophe of the hydrogenic problem at @xmath43 @xcite , it is not difficult to convince oneself that a finite - size model of a spherical proton avoids the general - relativistic spacetime singularity of the reissner  nordstrm spacetime of a point proton .",
    "although this introduces the problem of having to make assumptions about the structure of the proton , the tiny size of the proton suggests that all possible spherical finite size models should yield the same leading order corrections ( in terms of powers of @xmath1 ) to the special - relativistic spectrum .",
    "for example , assuming a model that produces a spherical surface charge , and zero binding energy , one would obtain a spacetime which coincides with the reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetime for @xmath44 , and which is flat for @xmath45 . here",

    "the spacetime is not smooth at @xmath46 but its singularity corresponds to just a jump in its ricci curvatures .",
    "so a @xmath1-perturbative calculation of the dirac spectrum should be feasible .",
    "so far we have assumed that the proton has only an electric charge",
    ". however , the physical proton appears to also possess a magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the interaction of the electron spin - magnetic moment with this magnetic moment of the proton accounts for a hyperfine structure of the hydrogen spectrum , as computed with quantum - mechanical perturbation theory . unfortunately , assuming a point proton carrying an electric charge and magnetic dipole is qm - non - perturbatively catastrophic even in a non - relativistic setting .",
    "a qm - non - perturbative calculation requires a model of a finite - size proton .",
    "pekeris @xcite proposed that as a substitute for such a finite - size model of the proton with charge and currents one may want to take the well - known electromagnetic kerr ",
    "newman spacetime family with its ring singularity and electromagnetic fields which , near spacelike infinity , approach an electric monopole and a magnetic dipole structure .",
    "of course , this proposal should not be taken too seriously , in the sense that the inner structure of the proton is hardly reproduced correctly by the kerr  newman solution .",
    "yet it is certainly interesting to investigate dirac s equation for a point electron in the kerr ",
    "newman spacetime with its parameters matched to those of the proton .",
    "in the spirit of the previous subsection we now inquire into the general - relativistic spectrum of a `` test '' electron in the electromagnetic kerr ",
    "newman spacetime @xcite , pretending that its electromagnetic fields represent those of an extended proton with charge and magnetic moment .",
    "we do not display its metric ( the line element of which is much more complicated than ; a special case will be exhibited further below , though ) but only mention that it has three parameters  charge @xmath27 ( here chosen to equal @xmath25 ) , adm mass @xmath36 ( here chosen to equal @xmath24 ) , and adm angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath52 , here to be chosen such that @xmath53 equals the magnetic moment of the proton .",

    "we inquire into whether a @xmath1-deformation of the sommerfeld spectrum with hyperfine corrections can be computed by studying dirac s equation on the kerr ",
    "newman spacetime , the outcome is somewhat disappointing : the proton parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 belong to the naked singularity sector of the kerr ",
    "newman family , and nothing seems to be known about the dirac equation on it .    on the other hand , since the proton mass does not enter the sommerfeld fine structure formula , one may still ask about the @xmath1-dependence of the discrete dirac spectra in the extreme kerr  newman black hole spacetime and whether they resemble the sommerfeld spectrum with hyperfine corrections as @xmath0 ; unfortunately , so far not much is known about these point spectra , either , but someone should work out the answer eventually !      the inquiry started in the previous subsection suggests a closely related spectral question about the dirac operator and the kerr ",
    "newman spacetime , one which avoids all the causal pathologies associated with the latter .",

    "interestingly , by anti - symmetry , the negative energy `` ground '' state ( in the sense of having smallest absolute energy ) is obtained by reflection of the positive energy ground state profile at @xmath30 . by the same kind of `` intuitive explanation '' given of the behavior of the electron in the positive energy ground state",

    "motivated by the mathematical - physics problem of general - relativistic extensions of the sommerfeld fine - structure spectrum of hydrogen , in particular those including the hyper - fine structure , in this presentation we have addressed the dirac equation of a point electron in the zero-@xmath1 limit of the maximal analytically extended , double - sheeted kerr  newman spacetime .",
    "a related study has been proposed by pekeris @xcite who , however , studied dirac s equation on a _ one - sheeted truncation _ of the z@xmath1kn spacetime , which comes at the price of nonintegrable `` proton '' charge and current `` densities '' concentrated in a disc and raises the question of boundary conditions for the dirac bispinors at the disc ; cf . also @xcite . by contrast",
    ", we have found that our z@xmath1kn dirac hamiltonian is essentially self - adjoint , and its unique self - adjoint extension has a spectrum which is symmetric about zero , containing the familiar continuum @xmath267 plus , under a smallness condition , a discrete spectrum in the gap of the continuum ; for the hydrogen parameter values the smallness condition is satisfied .",
    "moreover , our results imply that the point spectrum converges to two anti - symmetric copies of the sommerfeld spectrum when the ring radius of the z@xmath1kn spacetime vanishes , if it converges to the spectrum of the zero-@xmath52 operator .",
    "we end this summary with a disclaimer : we are not advocating that the ring singularity of the double - sheeted z@xmath1kn spacetime were an accurate model for a physical proton .",
    "rather our z@xmath1kn born - oppenheimer hydrogen atom model is merely an interesting toy model which reduces to the familiar special - relativistic born  oppenheimer hydrogen atom model ( and an antisymmetric copy thereof ) when @xmath268 , and thus allows one to rigorously study non - perturbatively some general - relativistic @xmath269 effects on the quantum - mechanical hydrogen spectrum , such as the hyperfine structure ( which can not be studied non - perturbatively with the point proton model , featuring an electric charge and a magnetic dipole moment ) .",
    "first of all , we would like to know the point spectrum of the `` double - sheeted z@xmath1kn '' dirac hamiltonian in more detail , and as function of the ring radius @xmath52 ; a numerical study is currently in progress .",
    "more in line with pde research into dirac s equation on general relativistic spacetimes , we would like to know what happens when a dirac bispinor wave function impinges on the z@xmath1kn ring singularity ; in particular , how much of it scatters and how much will dive through the ring ?    furthermore , we would like to know what happens if the z@xmath1kn magnetic moment @xmath225 is replaced by @xmath226 , so that the electromagnetic z@xmath1kn spacetime becomes a z@xmath1k spacetime decorated with an appell  sommerfeld field of arbitrary charge @xmath27 and current @xmath227 .",
    "is the dirac hamiltonian still essentially self - adjoint ?",
    "if not , are there distinguished self - adjoint extensions ? can one characterize the spectrum of the self - adjoint extension(s ) ? note that , if @xmath270 then the chandrasekhar ",
    "page  toop ansatz to separate variables fails , and one is faced with a two - variable pde eigenvalue problem .",
    "incidentally , independent of any inquiry into the dirac equation , the following question is relevant to the problem of uniqueness of the kerr ",

    "maxwell equations only for the kn choice @xmath271 ?",
    "thus we also would like to investigate what happens when gravity is `` switched back on . ''",
    "after reviewing the enormous obstacles which are encountered in the pertinent literature on the subject , we concluded that these are caused mainly by the non - integrable electromagnetic self - energy densities of point electron and point or ring proton as computed with the linear maxwell ",
    "lorentz equations which lead to unphysical spacetime curvatures once gravity is switched on .",
    "to avoid these problems we plan to study the nonlinear einstein  maxwell  born  infeld system , which promises to yield the mildest conceivable spacetime singularities @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , their nonlinearity is formidable , and progress will most likely come slowly . moreover , it is clear that one has to abandon the born ",
    "oppenheimer approximation , but the full two - body problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) may still be out of reach .      as for the intriguing speculations , our research also led to a completely different line of inquiry which we have embarked on in @xcite",
    "namely , as has been advocated by stckelberg @xcite , feynman @xcite , thaller @xcite , @xcite , and others , the puzzling spectral properties of dirac s equation interpreted quantum mechanically , as again highlighted by the mysterious anti - symmetry of the dirac spectrum of a `` point electron '' in the anti - symmetric double - sheeted z@xmath1kn spacetime , suggest that dirac s equation captures the dynamics and bound states of both _ electron and positron_. yet interpreted as a quantum - mechanical equation , dirac s equation is a _ single particle _ equation .",
    "this has suggested to us to entertain the hypothesis that particles and anti - particles are merely `` different sides of the same medal , '' i.e. forming a single meta - particle with a binary structure , rather than being different particles in their own right .",
    "the very anti - symmetric structure of the z@xmath1kn ring singularity supplies just such a binary structure , which in @xcite we have tentatively identified with an electron / anti - electron meta - particle . there",
    "we show that the dirac spectrum of such a z@xmath1kn - ring particle in the electrostatic field of a given point charge ( now playing the role of the point proton ) with straight world line in the pertinent z@xmath1kn spacetime is determined by the same equation that we have discussed in this presentation .",
    "it s the narrative that changes , not the mathematics .",
    "this narrative , where electron and anti - electron are just two different `` sides of the same medal , '' is faithfully realized by the electromagnetic ring singularity of the z@xmath1kn spacetime , and we ponder seriously the possibility of it having a true physical significance .      many thanks go to felix finster , jrgen tolksdorf , and eberhard zeidler for their kind invitation to present these results at their superbly organized conference , and for the financial support and the impeccable hospitality offered by the organizers and their staff .",
