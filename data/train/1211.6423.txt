    "soon after the pristine clouds of primordial gas collapsed to assemble a protogalaxy , star formation ensued , leading to the production of heavy elements ( metals ) . metals were synthesized exclusively in stars , and were ejected into the interstellar medium ( ism ) through stellar winds or supernovae explosions . tracing the heavy element abundance ( metallicity ) in star - forming galaxies provides a  fossil record \" of galaxy formation and evolution .    when considered as a closed system , the metal content of a galaxy",
    "is directly related to the yield and gas fraction @xcite . in reality ,",
    "a galaxy interacts with its surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) , hence both the overall and local metallicity distribution of a galaxy is modified by feedback processes such as galactic winds , inflows , and gas accretions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , observations of the chemical abundances in galaxies offer crucial constraints on the star formation history and various mechanisms responsible for galactic inflows and outflows .",
    "the well - known correlation between galaxy mass ( luminosity ) and metallicity was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies confirmed the existence of the luminosity - metallicity ( lz ) relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "luminosity was used as a proxy for stellar mass in these studies as luminosity is a direct observable .",
    "aided by new sophisticated stellar population models , stellar mass can be robustly calculated and a tighter correlation is found in the mass - metallicity ( mz ) relation . @xcite have established the mz relation for local star - forming galaxies based on @xmath18 5@xmath210@xmath19 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxies . at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath20 ) , the mz relation has also been observed for a large number of galaxies ( @xmath21100 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite derived the mz relation for @xmath18 10@xmath22 galaxies from the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe 2 ( deep2 ) survey , validating the mz relation on a statistically significant level at @xmath8 .",
    "current cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytical models can predict the metallicity history of galaxies on a cosmic timescale @xcite .",
    "these models show that the shape of the mz relation is particularly sensitive to the adopted feedback mechanisms .",
    "the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with momentum - driven winds models provide better match with observations than energy - driven wind models @xcite .",
    "however , these models have not been tested thoroughly in observations , especially at high redshifts ( @xmath1 ) , where the mz relation is still largely uncertain .",
    "as we move to higher redshifts , selection effects and small number statistics haunt observational metallicity history studies .",
    "the difficulty becomes more severe in the so - called  redshift desert \" ( @xmath23 ) , where the metallicity sensitive optical emission lines have shifted to the sky - background dominated near infrared ( nir ) .",
    "ironically , this redshift range harbors the richest information about galaxy evolution .",
    "it is during this redshift period ( @xmath18 2@xmath46 gyrs after the big bang ) that the first massive structures condensed ; the star formation rate ( sfr ) , major merger activity , and black hole accretion rate peaked ; much of today s stellar mass was assembled , and heavy elements were produced @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of crucial importance to explore nir spectra for galaxies in this redshift range .",
    "many spectroscopic redshift surveys have been carried out to study star - forming galaxies at @xmath241 in recent years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , due to the low efficiency in the nir , those spectroscopic surveys almost inevitably have to rely on color - selection criteria and the biases in uv - selected galaxies tend to select the most massive and less dusty systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "space telescopes can observe much deeper in the nir and are able to probe a wider mass range .",
    "for example , the narrow - band h@xmath25  surveys based on the new wfc3 camera aboard the hubble space telescope ( @xmath26 ) have located hundreds of h@xmath25  emitters up to z = 2.23 , finding much fainter systems than observed from the ground @xcite .",
    "however , the low - resolution spectra from the narrow band filters forbid derivations of physical properties such as metallicities that can only currently be acquired from ground - based spectral analysis .",
    "thanks to the advent of long - slit / multi - slit nir spectrographs on 8@xmath410 meter class telescopes , enormous progress has been made in the last decade to capture galaxies in the redshift desert . for chemical abundance studies ,",
    "a full coverage of rest - frame optical spectra ( 4000@xmath49000@xmath27 ) is usually mandatory for the most robust diagnostic analysis . for 1.5 @xmath28 ,",
    "the rest - frame optical spectra have shifted into the j , h , and k bands .",
    "it remains challenging and observationally expensive to obtain high signal - to - noise ( @xmath29 ) nir spectra from the ground , especially for  typical \" targets at high-@xmath30 that are less massive than conventional color - selected galaxies .",
    "therefore , previous investigations into the metallicity properties between @xmath23 focused on stacked spectra , samples of massive luminous individual galaxies , or very small numbers of lower - mass galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first mass - metallicity ( mz ) relation for galaxies at z @xmath18 2 was found by @xcite using the stacked spectra of 87 uv selected galaxies divided into 6 mass bins .",
    "subsequently , mass and metallicity measurements have been reported for numerous individual galaxies at 1.5 @xmath31 3 @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are selected using broadband colors in the uv ( lyman break technique ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or using b , z , and k - band colors ( bzk selection ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lyman break and bzk selection techniques favor galaxies that are luminous in the uv or blue and may therefore be biased against low luminosity ( low - metallicity ) galaxies , and dusty ( potentially metal - rich ) galaxies . because of these biases",
    ", galaxies selected in this way may not sample the full range in metallicity at redshift z @xmath211 .",
    "a powerful alternative method to avoid these selection effects is to use strong gravitationally lensed galaxies . in the case of galaxy cluster",
    "lensing , the total luminosity and area of the background sources can easily be boosted by @xmath32 times , providing invaluable opportunities to obtain high s / n spectra and probe intrinsically fainter systems within a reasonable amount of telescope time . in some cases , sufficient s / n can even be obtained for spatially resolved pixels to study the resolved metallicity of high-@xmath30 galaxies @xcite . before 2011 , metallicities have been reported for a handful of individually lensed galaxies using optical emission lines at 1.5 @xmath31 3 @xcite .",
    "fortunately , lensed galaxy samples with metallicity measurements have increased significantly thanks to reliable lensing mass modeling and larger dedicated spectroscopic surveys of lensed galaxies on 8 - 10 meter telescopes @xcite .    in 2008",
    ", we began a spectroscopic observational survey designed specifically to capture metallicity sensitive lines for lensed galaxies .",
    "taking advantage of the multi - object cryogenic nir spectrograph ( moircs ) on subaru , we targeted well - known strong lensing galaxy clusters to obtain metallicities for galaxies between 0.8 @xmath31 3 . in this paper , we present the first metallicity measurement results from our survey . combining our new data with existing data from the literature",
    ", we present a coherent observational picture of the metallicity history and mass - metallicity evolution of star - forming galaxies from @xmath33 to @xmath34 . @xcite",
    "have shown that the metallicity offsets in the diagnostic methods can easily exceed the intrinsic trends .",
    "it is of paramount importance to make sure that relative metallicities are compared on the same metallicity calibration scale . in mz relation studies",
    ", the methods used to derive the stellar mass can also cause systematic offsets @xcite .",
    "different sed fitting codes can yield a non - negligible mass offset , hence mimicking or hiding evolution in the mz relation . in this paper",
    ", we derive the mass and metallicity of all samples using the same methods , ensuring that the observational data are compared in a self - consistent way .",
    "we compare our observed metallicity history with the latest prediction from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations .    throughout this paper",

    "naturally , lensed sample is biased towards highly magnified sources . however , because the largest magnifications are not biased towards intrinsically bright targets , lensed samples are less biased towards the intrinsically most luminous galaxies .",
    "abell 1689 is chosen as the primary target for moircs observations because it has the largest number ( @xmath18 100 arcs , or @xmath18 30 source galaxies ) of spectroscopically identified lensed arcs @xcite .",

    "however , since both the slope and amplitude of the t04 sdss mz relation are significantly larger than the sdss mz relation derived using the pp04n2 method @xcite , the pp04n2-normalized mz relation from the model does not recover the local mz relation within @xmath140 .",
    "in addition , the stellar mass measurements from different methods may cause a systematic offsets in the x - direction of the mz relation @xcite . as a result , even though the shape , scatter , and evolution with redshifts are independent predictions from the model , systematic uncertainties in metallicity diagnostics and stellar mass estimates do not allow the shape to be constrained separately .",
    "in the right panel of figure  [ fig : mz ] , we allow the model slope ( @xmath25 ) , metallicity amplitude ( @xmath141 ) , and stellar mass ( m@xmath142 ) to change slightly so that it fits the local sdss mz relation . assuming that this change in slope ( @xmath143 ) , and x , y amplitudes ( @xmath144 ) are caused by the systematic offsets in observations , then the same @xmath143 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 can be applied to model mz relations at other redshifts . although normalizing the model mz relation in this way will make the model lose prediction power for the shape of the mz relation , it at least leaves the redshift evolution of the mz relation as a testable model output .    despite the normalization correction , we see from figure  [ fig : mz ] that the models predict less evolution from z @xmath18 2 to z @xmath18 0 than the observed mz relation .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive observational study of the gas phase metallicity of star - forming galaxies from @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we combine our new sample of gravitationally lensed galaxies with existing lensed and non - lensed samples to conduct a large investigation into the mass - metallicity ( mz ) relation at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a self - consistent metallicity calibration scheme to investigate the metallicity evolution of star - forming galaxies as a function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the lensing magnification ensures that our sample spans an unprecedented range of stellar mass ( 3 @xmath2 10@xmath3@xmath46@xmath210@xmath5 m@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at the median redshift of @xmath7 , the median metallicity of the lensed sample is 0.35 dex lower than the local sdss star - forming galaxies and 0.18 dex lower than the @xmath8 deep2 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the @xmath9 mz relation using 19 lensed galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> a more rapid evolution is seen between @xmath10 than @xmath11 for the high - mass galaxies ( 10@xmath12 m@xmath13m@xmath1410@xmath15 m@xmath6 ) , with almost twice as much enrichment between @xmath10 than between @xmath16 . </S>",
