    "the mechanism of magnetic ordering in dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) has traditionally attracted much attention of investigators .",
    "one of the issues being most intensely studied  @xcite concerns the microscopic nature of magnetism in bulk dmss ; in particular , whether the microscopic interaction governing the ferromagnetism ( fm ) is of zener / rkky type or double - exchange type .",
    "let us recall that the zener / rkky model is applicable when the effective coupling between local magnetic moments and the spins of charge carriers is smaller than the carrier bandwidth , and , this model is widely used in the context of magnetism in the kondo lattice systems  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the double exchange model is believed to describe the magnetism in manganites  @xcite and double perovskites  @xcite where the hund s rule coupling is known to be large compared to the carrier bandwidth . while the ordering of local moments of magnetic metal in both cases is mediated by the charge carriers of the semiconductor ( sc ) host ,",
    "the two models differ in the relative importance of the magnitudes of the effective coupling of the local moments with the spins of charge carriers and the intersite hopping integrals ( in other words the bandwidth for charge carriers ) .",
    "the current opinion is that both mechanisms of fm can take place in bulk dmss .",
    "the conditions of the realization of either mechanism strongly depend not only on the concentration of magnetic metal ions , but also on the character of their distribution in the sc host .",
    "the last factor plays an important role in fm ordering in bulk dmss and is crucially driven by the details of their growth technology .",
    "besides , technological or fabrication aspects drastically affect the character of fluctuations of crystal - field and exchange potentials in the sc host as well as the degree of ionization of magnetic metal atoms and effective concentration of carriers supplied by them when doping the host .",
    "these aspects also determine the relative importance of phase segregation in the system , as well as the contribution of wide and narrow bands in the spectrum of carriers to the coupling between local magnetic moments of the metal .",
    "an emerging trend in the studies of dmss concerns the investigation of hybrid layered heterostructures ( in the following we shall also use the term `` 2d dms structures '' ) containing magnetic ultrathin metal layers ( so - called @xmath0-layers ) embedded into a nonmagnetic sc heterostructure .",
    "this interest in 2d dms structures has a twofold motivation .",
    "the first one is practical : present - day microelectronic devices have a planar geometry and it becomes necessary to understand the mutual interaction of different parts of the structure such as the @xmath0-layer and quantum wells .",
    "a number of studies of 2d dms structures have been reported in the literature  @xcite . in refs .  , the fm state in mn @xmath0-doped gaas / algaas heterostructures was observed at rather high temperatures .",
    "however , these devices have low mobility values because the authors of refs .   aimed at achieving the highest possible hole density just in the vicinity of mn ions to maximize the curie temperature @xmath3 .",
    "note here that mn ions are responsible not only for magnetism but also act as acceptors and a source of the random potential that limits mobility .",
    "second , properties of 2d magnets are often qualitatively different from those of their bulk counterparts , and studies in heterostructures can sometimes clarify issues of basic research on two - dimensional magnetism in solids .",
    "issues peculiar to the heterostructures , such as magnetic anisotropy , limit their use in a general 2d ferromagnet problem .",
    "however for properties such as the frequency dependence of the magnetization noise , the universality of the behavior is not sensitive to issues such as magnetic anisotropy since the universality is dictated by other properties such as the existence of a conserved order parameter , and heterostructures provide a good platform .",
    "note also that as we have studied resistivity noise of the hole gas in the 2d quantum well , our analysis will be useful for studies of magnetic impurity effects in low - dimensional conductors .",
    "it is also perhaps worth observing here that the idea of using resistivity noise for probing magnetization dynamics that we develop here is not specifically for heterostructures and can be adapted for the study of other 2d ferromagnets .    as a rule ,",
    "in the bulk dmss there are no insurmountable problems in obtaining detailed information on fm ordering from direct magnetic measurements although it is often difficult to correctly interpret the obtained data in terms of some specific theoretical model . in 2d dms structures ,",
    "the situation turns out to be more complicated and direct magnetic measurements that are able to detect fm ordering in the metal layers are often tedious , troublesome , and sometimes even spurious as opposed to the bulk dmss .",
    "moreover , direct measurements of the magnetization are impractical given the small size of the magnetically active region in 2d dms structures .",
    "in such a situation , an indirect retrieval of magnetic characteristics ( for example , from resistivity and hall effect measurements ) becomes decisive , whereas for the bulk dmss , it is in general a subsidiary tool .",
    "however , even in the bulk dmss , the resistivity anomaly , which is a peak or shoulder at the temperature dependence of resistivity , is widely used as an evidence for the onset of significant fm correlations and the measure of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite in an earlier paper ( ref .  )",
    ", it was demonstrated that in contrast to the resistivity anomaly in bulk dmss , which typically appears near ( and above ) the curie temperature , the resistivity anomaly observed in 2d dms structures typically appear far below the mean - field curie temperature and may even exist in the absence of an actual magnetic phase transition .",
    "nevertheless , the resistivity anomaly ( a peak or shoulder ) in 2d dmss can be also regarded as an indication of the onset of significant fm correlations ) .",
    "@xcite    the use of indirect experimental methods to reveal magnetic properties in 2d dms structures introduces additional considerations into the interpretation of data compared to bulk samples .",
    "for example , magnetic proximity effects and long - range coulomb interaction between different components of such structures have a crucial influence on the magnetic and transport characteristics of the system .",
    "recently , structures with a single fm @xmath0-layer deposited near or inside the sc quantum well ( qw ) forming the 2d channel of conductivity have emerged as a test system to study magnetic proximity effects .",
    "for example , in ref .  , photoluminescence polarization was observed in al@xmath4ga@xmath5as / gaas / al@xmath4ga@xmath5as structures with a 0.5 monolayer of mnas placed at 5 nm from a gaas qw .",
    "crucially , these structures had a gate , which allowed shifting holes from the qw to the fm layer .",
    "it was shown that the holes in the qw are spin - polarized and that their degree of polarization strongly increases ( from 0.4% to 6.3% ) with the `` pressing '' gate voltage . in the control structures , lacking the fm @xmath0-layer , the photoluminescence polarization was not observed .",
    "induced photoluminescence polarization effect was recently observed in other structures such as gaas / in@xmath6ga@xmath7as / gaas ( @xmath8 ) containing mn @xmath0-layer separated from the ingaas qw by a 3 - 5 nm thick gaas spacer .  @xcite it is clear that the aforementioned results can hardly be explained by a simple tunneling of holes from the qw to fm layer through the spacer , since even under a pressing voltage the characteristic depth of such tunneling does not exceed 1 nm .    in 2d dms structures containing spatially separated 2d hole gas in the qw and fm @xmath0-layers , the mutual influence of these two subsystems has three effects that have a bearing on the magnetic properties .",
    "first , interpenetration of the wave function tails between the qw and the fm layers polarizes the spins of itinerant charge carriers in the qw and modifies the effective coupling between local spins in the fm layer .",
    "@xcite second , quantum fluctuations in the qw stabilize magnetic order in the fm layer , suppressing at the same time the amplitude of the magnetic moment and the transition temperature with respect to those found by mean - field estimates .",
    "@xcite third , electrostatic charge redistribution occurs between the qw and the fm layers due to their different density of states and depths ; and as a result , modification of the magnetic characteristics of the fm layer occurs even on purely classical grounds .",
    "@xcite    recently , different ways have been proposed to describe self - consistently ferromagnetic ordering and spin polarization of charge carriers in the 2d dms structures under discussion . assuming that mn atoms form isolated paramagnetic centers inside the @xmath0-layer , the authors of refs .",
    "proposed a model of indirect rkky - type exchange coupling between local moments of mn atoms in the @xmath0-layer via the `` tails '' of the wave function of itinerant hole states in qw . in the framework of the same assumption about of a localized character of the hole states in the @xmath0-layer , the authors of ref .",
    "formulated the problem in terms of the anderson - fano model of configuration interaction between the localized hole states at mn centers and itinerant hole states in the qw . in the framework of the method of ref",
    ".  , the spin splitting of itinerant hole states in an external magnetic field is strongly enhanced due to their hybridization with localized hole states .",
    "this leads to a resonant enhancement of the interband radiation recombination of itinerant holes and causes circular polarization of the luminescence in qw .    on the other hand ,",
    "an alternative approach based on the assumption of an itinerant character of the hole states in both the qw and fm @xmath0-layer was successfully used  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a thin layer of fm metal located in a bulk sc matrix induces quasi-2d spin - polarized collective states and a half - metallic type of an electron spectrum of the system is formed  @xcite .",
    "these states ( called also confinement states ) have rather extended character along the structure axis of growth because of their small binding energies , so they penetrate deep into the spacer and can reach the qw .",
    "it may be shown ( see the next section ) that hybridization of confinement states in the fm @xmath0-layer , with one - electron states in qw leads to the spin polarization of carriers in the qw .    in the model  @xcite , the holes in the qw play mostly an `` observer '' ( passive ) role in the exchange coupling inside the @xmath0-layer ,",
    "although this does not mean that they have no effect on the fm ordering in the system .",
    "@xcite if one assumes an easy - plane character of magnetic anisotropy of the `` free '' @xmath0-layer ( i.e. in the absence of the qw ) , then introducing a qw near the @xmath0-layer can drastically change the type of magnetic anisotropy . as a result",
    ", the easy axis of magnetization appears to be directed along the normal to the @xmath0-layer plane .",
    "@xcite experiments  @xcite as well as recent direct measurements of magnetic anisotropy  @xcite give clear indication of the existence of such an orientational transition .",
    "in addition to the effects of induced spin polarization of holes in the qw and the reorientation of magnetization in the fm @xmath0-layer , there exist purely electrostatic ( coulomb ) effects of charge redistribution between these two subsystems . as it was shown in ref .",
    ", the long - range fluctuations of electrostatic potential , which are inevitable due to an inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic metal ions over the fm @xmath0-layer , are projected onto the qw and give rise to similar fluctuations of electrostatic potential in the qw .",
    "due to this fact , the transport measurements involving charge carriers in the qw can reveal some tiny details of disorder in the distribution of magnetic metal ions in the fm @xmath0-layer , the latter being inaccessible by the direct magnetic measurements .",
    "it is evident from the above discussion that in comparison with bulk dms systems , 2d dms structures have a number of additional experimental and theoretical complications arising from the use of indirect probes for magnetism as well as the interplay between the magnetic @xmath0-layer and the qw .",
    "the choice of the indirect probe is dictated not only by the convenience of measurement , but also by the level of detail one is seeking as regards the properties .",
    "resistivity measurement , although an indirect probe of magnetism , is one of the most widely used probes in both bulk and 2d dms systems given its simplicity . in both systems , the observation of an anomaly in the temperature dependence of the resistivity is associated with the onset of significant ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "unfortunately , such a measurement is unsuitable for shedding light on the microscopic interactions governing fm : both the rkky and double - exchange models can describe the resistivity anomaly observed in dmss .",
    "this is not surprising since as far as such static properties are concerned , both can be described by effective heisenberg models .",
    "the differences manifest themselves , however , in the dynamic properties such as the autocorrelation function , since the damping of magnetic excitations is sensitive to the microscopic details governing the fluctuations . in the following",
    ", we shall show how the magnetization dynamics can be probed through resistivity noise measurements .",
    "while our analysis is applied to 2d dms structures , we note that this method of deducing the mechanism of fm from the analysis of dynamic susceptibility is quite general and can be used for other systems .    in this paper",
    ", we present a theoretical and experimental study of resistivity noise as an indirect probe of magnetic dynamics in 2d dms structures @xmath0-doped by magnetic atoms .",
    "we show how resistivity noise can distinguish between rkky / zener and double - exchange mechanisms .",
    "we find that in our structures the noise measurements are consistent with a disordered rkky picture .",
    "the experiments reported in this paper were performed using the gaas / in@xmath9ga@xmath7as / gaas qw structure @xmath0-doped by mn .",
    "such structures produced by selective doping exhibit a high enough hole mobility ( more than 2000 @xmath10 at 5 k )   and show clear evidence of a 2d excitation spectrum as well as fm at moderately high temperatures of about @xmath11 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] , we illustrate a schematic layout of the fabricated structures .",

    "before proceeding to the point at issue of our work , in this section we shall try to shed additional light on a key physical problem of the systems under consideration , namely , how magnetic correlations in the fm @xmath0-layer affect charge transport in the qw .",
    "let us recall the microscopic anderson - type model for a single fm @xmath0-layer embedded into the sc host proposed in refs .  .",
    "it has been shown that fm order in such system can be attributed to the intrinsic physical properties of the @xmath0-layer .",
    "the relevant effects described by this model are the hybridization of the electron states of the metal and semiconductor atoms , the strong charge and spin redistributions around the @xmath0-layer , and the electron - electron correlation on the metal atom .",

    "however , to reveal the main physics of the magnetic proximity effect between the fm @xmath0-layer and qw in the quantum structure described by hamiltonian  , we consider only the situation of a relatively thick spacer , @xmath60 .",

    "let us suppose that the effect of `` external '' holes in the qw on the fm ordering in the @xmath0-layer is less significant than that of `` intrinsic '' holes in the @xmath0-layer itself .",
    "the surface density of manganese ions estimated for the sample studied in the paper ( see sec .",
    "iv , sample 4 in refs .   is @xmath114 m@xmath96 ) , corresponding to the inter - manganese distance of about 1.6 nm . we consider @xmath115 as a nominal concentration of local magnetic moments in the @xmath0-layer .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to directly extract from the conductivity measurements the density of charge carriers ( holes ) in the @xmath0-layer , @xmath116 , due to their low mobility",
    ". we can roughly treat @xmath115 as an upper limit for @xmath116 , while the compensation between acceptors and donors in the @xmath0-layer can diminish this estimate by an order of magnitude .",
    "assuming further , that only holes in the qw participate in the conductivity , it is possible to determine a lower limit for @xmath116 as being of the order of the hole density in the qw , @xmath117 . taking @xmath118 m@xmath119 , from the conductivity data , we obtain the inter - hole distance in the @xmath0-layer @xmath120 falling within the 1.67 nm range .",
    "a naive estimate of the hole effective radius in the @xmath0-layer ( @xmath121 ) in the model of a single shallow acceptor gives @xmath122 nm , where @xmath123 is the bohr radius of a light hole in gaas . this value can be treated as an upper limit for @xmath121 , while it is obviously overestimated and even exceeds the thickness of the @xmath0-layer . in the more realistic model of a single deep impurity acceptor , we obtain @xmath124 nm for the heavy hole in gaas using experimentally known binding energy @xmath125 mev for mn@xmath126 ion in gaas . this value can be treated as a lower limit for @xmath121 .",
    "so , we get an estimate 0.9 nm @xmath127 5.3 nm .    at @xmath128 ,",
    "i.e. at a sufficiently high hole density , the zener / rkky mechanism is relevant for our system and describes well the fm ordering in the @xmath0-layer within the framework of an effective heisenberg spin hamiltonian with an effective coupling via itinerant holes . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetism in the polaron model arises by double exchange mechanism which is relevant at a sufficiently low concentration of the holes in the @xmath0-layer , such that @xmath129 . in the polaron percolation picture of kaminski and",

    "at low charge carrier densities , the random distribution of ionized mn atoms in the mn layer creates a fluctuating potential for the holes and leads to accumulation of holes in droplets .",

    "<S> we study theoretically and experimentally the frequency and temperature dependence of resistivity noise in semiconductor heterostructures @xmath0-doped by mn . the resistivity noise is observed to be non - monotonous as a function of frequency . as a function of temperature , the noise increases by two orders of magnitude for a resistivity increase of about 50% . </S>",
    "<S> we study two possible sources of resistivity noise  dynamic spin fluctuations and charge fluctuations , and find that dynamic spin fluctuations are more relevant for the observed noise data . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency and temperature dependence of resistivity noise provide important information on the nature of the magnetic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show how noise measurements can help resolve a long standing debate on whether the mn - doped gaas is a @xmath1-@xmath2 zener / ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) or double exchange ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis includes the effect of different kinds of disorder such as spin - glass type of interactions and a site - dilution type of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resistivity noise in these structures is well described by a disordered rkky ferromagnet model dynamics with a conserved order parameter . </S>"
