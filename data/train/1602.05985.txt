    "lie groups are a central subject of 20th century mathematics as well as physics . in particular",
    ", the largest exceptional lie group @xmath0 is central to string theory and grand unified theories and is thus arguably the single most important symmetry group in modern theoretical physics .",
    "lie groups are continuous groups and are closely related to their corresponding lie algebras .",
    "their non - trivial part in turn is described by a root system : a collection of reflection generating vectors called roots , which generate a reflection symmetry group ( called a crystallographic coxeter group or weyl group ) .",
    "it is easy to move between those four related concepts and we will usually not make a distinction  with the exception of non - crystallographic root systems such as @xmath3 ( which generates icosahedral symmetry ) and its 4d analogue @xmath4 , since their non - crystallographic nature means that there is no associated lie algebra .",
    "this lie - centric view point of much of theoretical physics , due to the fact that the gauge theories of high energy physics are formulated in terms of lie groups , has unduly neglected the non - crystallographic groups .",
    "here we instead advocate the root system as the more convenient and perhaps fundamental concept .",
    "the shift of perspective that allows to prove the central results of this paper is motivated in two ways .",
    "firstly , non - crystallographic symmetries such as icosahedral symmetry are important in other areas of science outside the gauge theory paradigm , such as for the symmetries of viruses and fullerenes @xcite , where we have demonstrated the usefulness of a root system - based approach .",
    "the second ingredient is employing a clifford algebra framework . since for root systems the use of an inner product is already implicit",
    ", one can construct the clifford algebra on the underlying vector space without any loss of generality , but achieving conceptual and computational simplifications .",
    "as these clifford algebras have matrix representations , there is traditionally much prejudice towards resorting to matrices rather than working with the algebra directly ; we advocate the more algebraic and geometric point of view , in particular as it provides a simple and geometric way to construct spinor groups .",
    "this approach offers a clifford geometric construction of all the exceptional root systems as induced from the 3d root systems , a fact that has not been appreciated before from the lie - theoretic perspective . the @xmath0 root system is commonly thought of as an exceptional ( i.e. there are no corresponding symmetry groups in arbitrary dimensions ) phenomenon of eight - dimensional geometry , far removed from 3d geometry . in this article",
    "we show that the eight dimensions of the 3d clifford algebra actually allow @xmath0 to be unveiled as a 3d geometric phenomenon in disguise ; likewise all 4d exceptional root systems also arise within 3d geometry in this way .",
    "this opens up a completely novel way of viewing exceptional higher - dimensional phenomena in terms of 3d spinorial geometry .",
    "this paper is structured in the following way .",
    "after some preliminary definitions and background in sections [ background ] ( root systems and reflection groups ) and [ sec_versor ] ( clifford algebras ) , we show in general that any 3d symmetry group induces a 4d symmetry group via their root systems ( section [ sec_pin ] ) .",
    "in particular , the platonic root systems @xmath5 induce all the exceptional 4d root systems @xmath6 in terms of 3d spinors ; this also explains their unusual symmetry groups . in section [ h4 ]",
    "we concretely explain the case of icosahedral symmetry @xmath3 inducing the exceptional largest non - crystallographic coxeter group @xmath4 from a spinor group ( the binary icosahedral group @xmath7 ) that describes the @xmath8 icosahedral rotations in terms of @xmath2 spinors doubly covering the rotations .",
    "the above collection of platonic root systems @xmath5 in fact forms a trinity that is related to the trinity of exceptional lie groups @xmath9 via various intermediate trinities and also via my new spinor construction in combination with the mckay correspondence .",
    "this is the first hint that the icosahedron may be indirectly related with @xmath0 .",
    "section [ birth ] makes a completely new , direct connection between them by concretely constructing the @xmath1 roots of the @xmath0 root system from the @xmath1 pinors that doubly cover the @xmath2 icosahedral reflections and rotations in the eight - dimensional clifford algebra of 3d .",
    "thus * all * the exceptional root systems can in fact be seen as induced from the polyhedral symmetries and the clifford algebra of 3d .",
    "this offers a new way of better understanding these exceptional phenomena in terms of spinorial geometry ; this reinterpretation has the potential for a wide range of profound consequences .",
    "we conclude in section [ concl ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce coxeter ( reflection ) groups via the root systems that generate them @xcite :    [ defrootsys ] a _ root system _ is a collection @xmath10 of non - zero ( root ) vectors @xmath11 spanning an @xmath12-dimensional euclidean vector space @xmath13 endowed with a positive definite bilinear form denoted by @xmath14 , which satisfies the two axioms :    1 .",
    "@xmath10 only contains a root @xmath11 and its negative , but no other scalar multiples : @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   @xmath10 is invariant under all reflections @xmath16 corresponding to reflections in hyperplanes orthogonal to root vectors in @xmath10 : @xmath17 .    for a crystallographic root system ,",
    "a subset @xmath18 of @xmath10 , called _ simple roots _ @xmath19 , is sufficient to express every element of @xmath10 via @xmath20-linear combinations with coefficients of the same sign .",
    "@xmath10 is therefore completely characterised by this basis of simple roots . in the case of the non - crystallographic root systems",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the same holds for the extended integer ring @xmath22=\\lbrace a+\\tau b| a , b \\in \\mathbb{z}\\rbrace$ ] , where @xmath23 is the golden ratio @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is its galois conjugate @xmath26 ( the two solutions to the quadratic equation @xmath27 ) . for the crystallographic root systems , the classification in terms of dynkin diagrams essentially follows the one familiar from lie groups and lie algebras , as their weyl groups are the crystallographic coxeter groups .",
    "a mild generalisation to so - called coxeter - dynkin diagrams is necessary for the non - crystallographic root systems :    a graphical representation of the geometric content of a root system is given by _",
    "coxeter - dynkin diagrams _ , where nodes correspond to simple roots , orthogonal roots are not connected , roots at @xmath28 have a simple link , and other angles @xmath29 have a link with a label @xmath30 .",
    "the _ cartan matrix _ of a set of simple roots @xmath31 is defined as the matrix @xmath32 .    for instance , the root system of the icosahedral group @xmath3 has one link labelled by @xmath33 ( via the above relation @xmath34 ) , as does its four - dimensional analogue @xmath4 .",
    "the reflections in the second axiom of the root system generate a reflection group .",
    "a coxeter group is a mathematical abstraction of the concept of a reflection group via involutory generators ( i.e. they square to the identity , which captures the idea of a reflection ) , subject to mixed relations that represent @xmath30-fold rotations ( since two successive reflections generate a rotation in the plane defined by the two roots ) .    a _ coxeter group _ is a group generated by a set of involutory generators @xmath35 subject to relations of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the finite coxeter groups have a geometric representation where the involutions are realised as reflections at hyperplanes through the origin in a euclidean vector space @xmath13 , i.e. they are essentially just the classical reflection groups",
    ". in particular , then the abstract generator @xmath39 corresponds to the simple reflection @xmath40 in the hyperplane perpendicular to the simple root @xmath41 .",
    "the action of the coxeter group is to permute these root vectors , and its structure is thus encoded in the collection @xmath42 of all such roots , which in turn form a root system .",
    "here we employ a clifford algebra framework , which via the geometric product affords a uniquely simple prescription for performing reflections via ` sandwiching ' @xmath43 ( assuming unit normalisation ) . since due to the cartan - dieudonn theorem any orthogonal transformation in any dimension and signature can be written as products of reflections , the ` sandwiching ' prescription in fact extends to any orthogonal transformation . for any root system , the quadratic form mentioned in the definition",
    "can always be used to enlarge the @xmath12-dimensional vector space @xmath13 to the corresponding @xmath44-dimensional clifford algebra .",
    "the clifford algebra is therefore a very natural object to consider in this context , as its unified structure simplifies many problems both conceptually and computationally , rather than applying the linear structure of the space and the inner product separately . in particular , it provides ( s)pinor double covers of the ( special ) orthogonal transformations , as well as geometric quantities that serve as unit imaginaries .",
    "we therefore advocate the use of clifford algebra as the most natural framework for root systems and reflection groups .",
    "clifford algebra can be viewed as a deformation of the ( perhaps more familiar ) exterior algebra by a quadratic form  though we do not necessarily advocate this point of view ; they are isomorphic as vector spaces , but not as algebras , and clifford algebra is in fact much richer due to the invertibility of the algebra product .",
    "the _ geometric product _ of geometric / clifford algebra is defined by @xmath45 , where the scalar product ( given by the symmetric bilinear form ) is the symmetric part @xmath46 and the exterior product the antisymmetric part @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "it provides a very compact and efficient way of handling reflections in any number of dimensions , and thus by the _ cartan - dieudonn theorem _ in fact of any orthogonal transformation . for a unit vector @xmath11 ,",
    "the two terms in the above formula for a reflection of a vector @xmath48 in the hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath11 simplify to the double - sided ( ` sandwiching ' ) action of @xmath11 via the geometric product @xmath49 this prescription for reflecting vectors in hyperplanes is remarkably compact ( note that @xmath11 and @xmath50 encode the same reflection and thus provide a double cover ) . via the cartan - dieudonn theorem ,",
    "any orthogonal transformation can be written as the product of reflections , and thus by performing consecutive reflections , each given via ` sandwiching ' , one is led to define a versor as a clifford multivector @xmath51 , that is the product of @xmath52 unit vectors @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "versors form a multiplicative group called the versor / pinor group @xmath54 under single - sided multiplication with the geometric product , with inverses given by @xmath55 , where the tilde denotes the reversal of the order of the constituent vectors @xmath56 , and the @xmath57-sign defines its parity .",
    "every orthogonal transformation @xmath58 of a vector @xmath48 can thus be expressed by means of unit versors / pinors via @xmath59 unit versors are double - covers of the respective orthogonal transformation , as @xmath60 and @xmath61 encode the same transformation .",
    "even versors @xmath62 , that is , products of an even number of vectors , are called _ spinors _ or _",
    "rotors_. they form a subgroup of the @xmath54 group and constitute a double cover of the special orthogonal group , called the @xmath63 group .",
    "clifford algebra therefore provides a particularly natural and simple construction of the @xmath63 groups .",
    "thus the remarkably simple construction of the binary polyhedral groups in section [ sec_pin ] is not at all surprising from a clifford point of view , but appears to be unknown in the coxeter community , and ultimately leads to the novel result of the spinor induction theorem of ( exceptional ) 4d root systems in section [ sec_pin ] and the construction of the @xmath0 root system from @xmath3 in section [ birth ] .",
    ".versor framework for a unified treatment of the chiral , full , binary and pinor polyhedral groups [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the versor realisation of the orthogonal group is much simpler than conventional matrix approaches .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] summarises the various action mechanisms of multivectors : a rotation ( e.g. the continuous group @xmath64 or the discrete subgroup , the chiral icosahedral group @xmath65 ) is given by double - sided action of a spinor @xmath62 , whilst these spinors themselves form a group under single - sided action / multiplication ( e.g. the continuous group @xmath66 or the discrete subgroup , the binary icosahedral group @xmath7 ) .",
    "likewise , a reflection ( continuous @xmath67 or the discrete subgroup , the full icosahedral group the coxeter group @xmath3 ) corresponds to sandwiching with the versor @xmath60 , whilst the versors single - sidedly form a multiplicative group ( the @xmath68 group or the discrete analogue , the double cover of @xmath3 , which we denote @xmath69 ) . in the conformal geometric algebra setup one",
    "uses the fact that the conformal group @xmath70 is homomorphic to @xmath71 to treat translations as well as rotations in a unified versor framework @xcite .",
    "@xcite also discuss reflections , inversions , translations and modular transformations in this way .",
    "the clifford / geometric algebra of three dimensions @xmath72 is generated by three orthogonal  and thus anticommuting  unit vectors @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ". it also contains the three bivectors @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 that all square to @xmath79 , as well as the highest grade object @xmath80 ( trivector and pseudoscalar ) , which also squares to @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , in clifford algebra various geometric objects arise that provide imaginary structures ; however , there can be different ones and they can have non - trivial commutation relations with the rest of the algebra . @xmath81",
    "in this section we prove that any 3d root system yields a 4d root system via the spinor group obtained by multiplying root vectors in the clifford algebra @xcite .",
    "[ hga_o4 ] the space of @xmath72-spinors @xmath82 can be endowed with a _",
    "4d euclidean norm _",
    "@xmath83 induced by the _ inner product _ @xmath84 between two spinors @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this allows one to reinterpret the group of 3d spinors generated from a 3d root system as a set of 4d vectors , which in fact can be shown to satisfy the axioms of a root system as given in definition [ defrootsys ] .",
    "[ hga_4drootsys ] any 3d root system gives rise to a spinor group @xmath87 which induces a root system in 4d .",
    "check the two axioms for the root system @xmath10 consisting of the set of 4d vectors given by the 3d spinor group :    1 .   by construction",
    ", @xmath10 contains the negative of a root @xmath62 since spinors provide a double cover of rotations , i.e. if @xmath62 is in a spinor group @xmath87 , then so is @xmath88 , but no other scalar multiples ( normalisation to unity ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath10 is invariant under all reflections with respect to the inner product @xmath89 in proposition [ hga_o4 ] since @xmath90 for @xmath91 by the closure property of the group @xmath87 ( in particular @xmath88 and @xmath92 are in @xmath87 if @xmath62 is ) .",
    "since the number of irreducible 3d root systems is limited to @xmath5 , this yields a definite list of induced root systems in 4d  this turns out to be @xmath6 , which are exactly the exceptional root systems in 4d .",
    "in fact both sets of three are trinities : named after arnold s observation that many related objects in mathematics form sets of three , beginning with the trinity @xmath93 @xcite , and extending to projective spaces , lie algebras , spheres , hopf fibrations etc .",
    "arnold s original link between these two trinities @xmath5 and @xmath6 that arise here is extremely convoluted , and our construction presents a novel direct link between the two .",
    "the abundance of root systems in 4d can in some sense be thought of as due to the accidentalness of our spinor construction . in particular",
    ", the induced root systems are precisely the exceptional ( i.e. they do not have counterparts in other dimensions ) root systems in 4d : @xmath94 has the triality symmetry ( permutation symmetry of the three legs in the diagram ) that is exceptional in 4d and is of great importance in string theory , showing the equivalence of the ramond - neveu - schwarz and the green - schwarz strings .",
    "@xmath95 is the only @xmath96-type root system , and @xmath4 is the largest non - crystallographic root system .",
    "in contrast , in arbitrary dimensions there are only @xmath97 ( @xmath12-simplex ) , @xmath98 ( @xmath12-hypercube and @xmath12-hyperoctahedron ) and @xmath99 .    not only is there an abundance of root systems related to the platonic solids as well as their exceptional nature @xcite , but they also have unusual automorphism groups , in that the order of the groups is proportional to the square of the number of roots .",
    "this is also explained via the above spinor construction via the following result :    [ hgasymmetry ] a root system induced through the clifford spinor construction via a binary polyhedral spinor group @xmath87 has an automorphism group that trivially contains two factors of the respective spinor group @xmath87 acting from the left and from the right .",
    "this systematises many case - by - case observations on the structure of the automorphism groups @xcite , and shows that all of the 4d geometry is already contained in 3d @xcite .",
    "for instance , the automorphism group of the @xmath4 root system is @xmath100  in the spinor picture , it is not surprising that @xmath7 yields both the root system and the two factors in the automorphism group .",
    "we therefore consider the example of the induction @xmath101 in more detail , as this will prove one of the crucial steps towards constructing the @xmath0 root system .",
    "here we construct the spinor group generated by the simple reflections of @xmath3 explicitly as an example and as an intermediate result .",
    "the simple roots of @xmath3 are taken as @xmath102 under free multiplication under the clifford algebra product , they generate a group with @xmath1 pinors , whilst the even subgroup consists of @xmath2 spinors , for instance of the form @xmath103 these are the double covers of @xmath104 of order @xmath2 and @xmath65 of order @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the spinors have four components ( @xmath105 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) ; by taking the components of these @xmath2 spinors as a set of vectors in 4d , one obtains @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 which are precisely the @xmath2 roots of the @xmath4 root system .",
    "this is very surprising from a coxeter perspective , as one usually thinks of @xmath3 as a subgroup of @xmath4 , and therefore of @xmath4 as more ` fundamental ' ; however , one now sees that @xmath4 does not in fact contain any structure that is not already contained in @xmath3 , and can therefore think of @xmath3 as more fundamental @xcite .    from a clifford perspective",
    "it is not surprising to find this group of @xmath2 spinors , which is the binary icosahedral group @xmath7 , since clifford algebra provides a simple construction of the spin groups ; however , this is completely unexpected from the conventional coxeter and lie group perspective .",
    "this spinor group @xmath7 has @xmath2 elements and @xmath109 conjugacy classes .",
    "@xmath110 has five conjugacy classes and it being of order @xmath8 implies that it has five irreducible representations of dimensions @xmath105 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath33 ( since the sum of the dimensions squared gives the order of the group @xmath114 ) .",
    "the nine conjugacy classes of the binary icosahedral group @xmath7 of order @xmath2 mean that this acquires a further four irreducible spinorial representations @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the automorphism group of the @xmath4 root system is @xmath100 , which in this framework is trivial ( see theorem [ hgasymmetry ] ) , as it merely reflects that @xmath7 is closed with respect to left and right multiplication , but the literature has been very confused about this simple fact by overlooking the underlying simple construction .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that it is convenient to have all these 4 different types of polyhedral groups in a unified framework within the clifford algebra , rather than using @xmath64 matrices for the rotations and then having to somehow move to @xmath119 matrices for the binary groups .    in terms of a quaternionic description of the even ( spinorial ) subalgebra ( they are isomorphic , though we advocate here the geometric rather than algebraic point of view ) , the @xmath3 root system consists precisely of the pure quaternions , i.e. those without a real part , and the full group",
    "can be generated from those under quaternion multiplication .",
    "this is very poorly understood in the literature , and just hinges on the above description in terms of spinors together with the fact that the inversion @xmath120 is contained in the full @xmath3 group , as one can then trivially hodge dualise root vectors to bivectors , which are pure quaternions .",
    "we have explained this in previous work @xcite .",
    "for instance , the statement is not true when the inversion is not contained in the group , as is the case for @xmath121 .",
    "however , the spinorial induction construction still works for this , yielding @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , the ` quaternionic generators ' generating the 4d groups via quaternion multiplication are just seen to be the even products of 3d simple roots @xmath122 and @xmath123 so that the 4d group manifestly does not contain anything that was not already contained in the 3d group .",
    "we therefore believe the spinor induction point of view of going from 3d to 4d is more fundamental than the pure quaternion approach identifying the 3d group as a subgroup of the 4d group .",
    "this binary icosahedral group has a curious connection with the affine lie algebra @xmath124 ( and likewise for the other binary polyhedral groups and the affine lie algebras of @xmath125-type ) via the so - called mckay correspondence @xcite , which is twofold : we can define a graph by assigning a node to each of the nine irreducible representations of the binary icosahedral group with the following rule for connecting nodes : each node corresponding to a certain irreducible representation is connected to the nodes corresponding to those irreducible representations that are contained in its tensor product with the irrep @xmath115 . for instance , tensoring the trivial representation @xmath105 with @xmath115 trivially gives @xmath115 and thus the only link @xmath105 has is with @xmath115 ; @xmath126 , such that @xmath115 is connected to @xmath105 and @xmath111 , etc .",
    "the graph that is built up in this way is precisely the dynkin diagram of affine @xmath0 , as shown in figure [ fige6aff ] .",
    "the second connection is the following observation : the coxeter element is the product of all the simple reflections @xmath127 and its order , the coxeter number @xmath128 , is @xmath129 for @xmath0 .",
    "this also happens to be the sum of the dimensions of the irreducible representations of @xmath7 , @xmath130 .",
    "this extends to all other cases of binary polyhedral groups and @xmath125-type affine lie algebras .",
    "is the same as the dynkin diagram of affine @xmath0 .",
    ", width=302 ]    the following indirect connection between @xmath5 and @xmath9 via clifford spinors does not seem to be known : we note that @xmath131 are not only the sums of the dimensions of the irreducible representations @xmath130 of the binary polyhedral groups , but more fundamentally are exactly the numbers of roots @xmath10 in the 3d root systems @xmath5 from which these binary polyhedral groups are generated .",
    "this fact connects the 3d root systems through the binary polyhedral groups and via the mckay correspondence all the way to the affine lie algebras .",
    "our construction therefore makes deep connections between trinities , and puts the mckay correspondence into a wider framework .",
    "it is also striking that the affine lie algebra and the 4d root system trinities have identical dynkin diagram symmetries : @xmath94 and @xmath132 have triality @xmath133 , @xmath95 and @xmath134 have an @xmath135 symmetry and @xmath4 and @xmath124 only have @xmath136 .",
    "there is thus an indirect connection between the icosahedral group @xmath3 and the exceptional @xmath0 . in the next section",
    "we will show a new , explicit direct connection between @xmath3 and @xmath0 within the clifford algebra of 3d , by identifying the @xmath1 roots of @xmath0 with the @xmath1 pinors of icosahedral symmetry .",
    "previously , we discussed the construction of the @xmath2 elements of the binary icosahedral group @xmath7 ( within the 4d even subalgebra of the 8d clifford algebra of 3d space ) , which can be reinterpreted as the @xmath2 roots of @xmath4 . here",
    "we list these elements again in terms of a 4d basis @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath137 a convenient set of simple roots for @xmath4 is given by @xmath138 @xmath139    since the @xmath3 root system contains three orthogonal roots , e.g. @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , the pinor group generated under free clifford multiplication contains the inversion , given by double - sided action of @xmath143 .",
    "so whilst the @xmath2 even products of root vectors stay in the 4d even spinor subalgebra consisting of scalar and bivector parts , the @xmath2 odd products in the remaining vector and pseudoscalar part of the algebra are just a second copy of these spinors multiplied by @xmath110 .",
    "so for the pinors double covering the group @xmath3 of order @xmath2 in the clifford algebra of 3d space  which is itself an 8d vector space  one gets @xmath1 objects , as one would expect for a construction of @xmath0 , and furthermore , they consist of a copy of @xmath4 with @xmath2 roots and another copy multiplied by @xmath110 , schematically @xmath144 .    for this set of @xmath1 pinors one can now define a ` reduced inner product ' in the following way @xcite : we keep the spinor copy of @xmath4 and multiply the copy @xmath145 by @xmath146 , then take inner products taking into account the recursion relation @xmath147 but finally in this inner product ( counterintuitively ) setting @xmath23 equal to zero",
    ". an equivalent point of view is this : a general inner product between roots over the extended integer ring @xmath22 $ ] is a @xmath22$]-integer and thus has an integer and a @xmath23 part @xmath148 .",

    "this discovery was only possible in clifford algebra ",
    "there is much prejudice against the usefulness of clifford algebras ( since they have matrix representations ) and usually matrix methods are equivalent if less insightful  but the 4d and 8d induction constructions are to our knowledge the only results that _ require _ clifford algebra and were invisible to standard matrix methods .",

    "<S> @xmath0 is prominent in mathematics and theoretical physics , and is generally viewed as an exceptional symmetry in an eight - dimensional space very different from the space we inhabit ; for instance the lie group @xmath0 features heavily in ten - dimensional superstring theory . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to that point of view , here we show that the @xmath0 root system can in fact be constructed from the icosahedron alone and can thus be viewed purely in terms of three - dimensional geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 roots of @xmath0 arise in the 8d clifford algebra of 3d space as a double cover of the @xmath2 elements of the icosahedral group , generated by the root system @xmath3 . as a by - product , by restricting to even products of root vectors ( spinors ) in the 4d even subalgebra of the clifford algebra , one can show that each 3d root system induces a root system in 4d , which turn out to also be exactly the exceptional 4d root systems . </S>",
    "<S> the spinorial point of view explains their existence as well as their unusual automorphism groups . </S>",
    "<S> this spinorial approach thus in fact allows one to construct all exceptional root systems within the geometry of three dimensions , which opens up a novel interpretation of these phenomena in terms of spinorial geometry . </S>"
