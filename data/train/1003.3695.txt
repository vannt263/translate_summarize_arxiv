    "studying the properties of neutron stars allows us to test our knowledge on the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that a neutron star is expected to have a liquid core surrounded by an inner crust  @xcite , which extends outward to the neutron drip - out region .",
    "while the neutron drip - out density @xmath0 has been relatively well determined  @xcite , the transition density @xmath1 at the inner edge of the crust is still quite uncertain because of our limited knowledge on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , especially the density dependence of the symmetry energy ( @xmath2 ) of neutron - rich nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made in constraining the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter using terrestrial laboratory experiments ( see ref .",

    "this leads to the constraints @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 mev/@xmath12 mev/@xmath13 , respectively , for the transition density and pressure .",
    "together with the crustal fraction of the total moment inertia of the vela pulsar extracted from its glitches  @xcite , a tighter constraint on the mass - radius relation of cold neutron stars was obtained  @xcite .",
    "because of the initial high temperature and appreciable proton fraction in a newly - formed neutron star immediately after gravitational collapse of a massive star  @xcite , neutrinos are abundantly produced from the urca process in its inner core .",
    "although high energy neutrinos can be trapped at densities as low as 10@xmath14 g / cm@xmath3  @xcite , the stars cools by neutrino emissions . as neutrinos are emitted from this so - called proto - neutron star , which has an initial temperature of @xmath16 ( about @xmath17 mev )  @xcite , its temperature drops to @xmath18 ( about @xmath19 mev ) and even lower .",
    "afterwards , the neutron star becomes transparent to neutrinos as their mean free path increases with decreasing energy , and the cooling of the neutron star continues to be dominated by neutrino emission for a long time .",
