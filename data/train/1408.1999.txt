    "a most useful property of lebesgue measure @xmath6 is its ( inner ) _ regularity _ : for any measurable set @xmath7 , we can find an @xmath8 set @xmath9 with @xmath10 . in other words , any measurable set can be represented as an @xmath8 set plus a nullset .",
    "this means that , for measure theoretic considerations , @xmath7 can be replaced by an @xmath8 , simplifying the complicated topological structure of arbitrary measurable sets .",
    "it is a basic result in geometric measure theory that regularity holds for @xmath0-dimensional _ hausdorff measure _",
    "@xmath1 ( @xmath11 ) , too , with one important restriction .",
    "if @xmath7 is @xmath12-measurable and of finite @xmath12-measure , then there exists an @xmath8 set @xmath9 so that @xmath13 .    in particular , one can approximate measurable sets of finite measure from inside through closed sets .",
    "[ cor : inner_reg ] @xmath14    the requirement that @xmath15 is essential , since besicovitch@xcite later showed that there is a @xmath16 set @xmath17 of hausdorff dimension @xmath18 so that for every @xmath8 subset @xmath19 , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath20 is @xmath18 , too .    nevertheless , one can ask whether remains true even when @xmath21 is infinite .",
    "this is indeed so .",
    "in fact , one can approximate @xmath7 in measure by closed sets of _ finite measure _ , provided @xmath7 is _",
    "analytic_.    [ bd ] the _ subsets of finite measure _ property holds for any analytic @xmath22 subset of the real line .",
    "this result is one of the cornerstones of geometric measure theory , since it allows to pass from a set of infinite measure , which may be cumbersome to deal with since @xmath12 is not @xmath23-finite , to a closed set of finite measure , on which @xmath12 is much better behaved .",
    "the theorem was first shown for closed sets in euclidean space by besicovitch@xcite and extended to analytic sets by davies @xcite .",
    "we will therefore refer to theorem [ bd ] also as the _ besicovitch - davies theorem_.    besicovitch @xcite had shown before that there exists a measurable set in the euclidean plane every subset of which has @xmath18-dimensional measure either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "hence some restrictions on the definability of @xmath7 are necessary for to hold .",
    "moreover , the existence of subsets of finite measure also depends on the underlying space , as well as on the nature of the dimension function .",
    "davies and rogers @xcite constructed a compact metric space @xmath26 and a dimension function @xmath27 such that @xmath26 has infinite @xmath28-measure but @xmath26 does not contain any sets of finite positive @xmath28-measure .",
    "a few years before , on the other hand , larman @xcite had shown that does hold for a class of compact metric spaces ( those of _ finite dimension _ in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "rogers @xcite proves it for complete , separable _",
    "ultrametric spaces_. hence holds for cantor space @xmath29 and baire space @xmath30 .",
    "most recently , using a quite different approach , howroyd @xcite was able to prove the validity of for any analytic subset of a complete separable metric space .",
    "it holds also for generalized hausdorff measures @xmath28 , too , provided the dimension function @xmath27 does not decrease to @xmath24 too rapidly .    in the following",
    ", we will study the complexity of finding subsets of positive measure in cantor space @xmath29 , endowed with the standard metric @xmath31 the hierarchies of effective descriptive set theory allow for a further ramification of regularity properties .",
    "any ( boldface ) borel set is effectively ( lightface ) borel relative to a parameter .",
    "hence we can , for instance , given a ( lightface ) @xmath32 set , measure how hard it is to find a @xmath33 subset of the same measure , by proving lower bounds on the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "dobrinen and simpson  @xcite investigated this question for @xmath35 sets in lebesgue measure and discovered an interesting connection with measure - theoretic _",
    "domination properties_. kjos - hanssen @xcite in turn linked measure - theoretic domination properties to lr - reducibility , a reducibility concept from algorithmic randomness .",
    "recently , simpson @xcite gave a complete characterization of the regularity problem for borel sets with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "one of his results states that the property that every @xmath36 ( @xmath37 a recursive ordinal ) subset of @xmath29 has a @xmath38 subset of the same lebesgue measure holds if and only if @xmath39 .",
    "his paper @xcite also contains a survey of previous results along with an extensive bibliography .    in this paper",
    ", we study the complexity of the corresponding inner regularity for hausdorff measure on @xmath29 , extending and refining previous work by the authors @xcite .",
    "we will see that , in contrast to the case of lebesgue measure , finding subsets of positive hausdorff measure can generally not be done with the help of a _",
    "hyperarithmetic _ oracle .",
    "the core observation is that determining whether a set of reals has _ positive hausdorff measure _ is more similar to determining whether it is _ non - empty _ than to determining whether it has _ positive lebesgue measure_.    determining the exact strength of the besicovitch - davies theorem is not only of intrinsic interest .",
    "a family of important problems in theoretical computer science ask some version of the question to what extent randomness ( which is a useful computational tool ) can be extracted from a weakly random source ( which is often all that is available ) .",
    "such questions can also be expressed in computability theory .",
    "the advantage , and simultaneously the disadvantage , of doing so is that one abstracts away from considering any particular model of efficient computation .",
    "one way to conceive of weak randomness is in terms of _ effective hausdorff dimension_. miller @xcite and greenberg and miller @xcite obtained a negative result for randomness extraction : there is a real of effective hausdorff dimension 1 , that does not turing compute any martin - lf random real . despite this negative result , effective hausdorff dimension , which is a `` lightface '' form of hausdorff dimension , has independent interest , as it seems to offer a way to redevelop much of geometric measure theory ( for example frostman s lemma @xcite ) in a more effective way .",
    "another conception of weak randomness comes from considering sets that differ from martin - lf random sets only on a sparse set of bits @xcite , or sets that are subsets of martin - lf sets @xcite .",
    "actually , these conceptions are related , as we will try to illustrate with the help of the set @xmath40 of all reals that bound no 1-random real in the turing degrees , i.e. , those reals to which no martin - lf random real is turing reducible .    [ min ] the set @xmath40 has hausdorff dimension 1 .",
    "this is merely a relativization of a theorem of greenberg and miller @xcite .",
    "theorem [ min ] says that high effective hausdorff dimension is not sufficient to be able to extract randomness .",
    "it can also be used to deduce that infinite subsets of random sets are not sufficiently close to being random , either .",
    "the set @xmath40 is borel , so by the besicovitch - davies theorem , for any @xmath41 it has a closed subset @xmath42 that has non - zero @xmath1-measure .",
    "each closed set @xmath42 in cantor space is @xmath43 for some oracle @xmath44 . by a reasoning similar to @xcite*theorem 4.3 , each @xmath44-random closed set contains a member of @xmath42",
    "it follows by reasoning as in @xcite that each @xmath44-random set has an infinite subset that does not turing compute any @xmath18-random ( martin - lf random ) set .",
    "thus , if @xmath44 could be chosen recursive , we would have a positive answer to the following question .",
    "[ q1 ] does each @xmath18-random subset of @xmath45 have an infinite subset that computes no @xmath18-random sets ?",
    "a partial answer to this question is known , using other methods :    each @xmath46-random set has an infinite subset that computes no @xmath18-random sets .",
    "but it is easy to see that the set @xmath44 just referred to can not be chosen recursive . to wit , any @xmath47 class of non - zero @xmath1-measure contains a @xmath47 class consisting entirely of reals of effective hausdorff dimension @xmath48 . by the computably enumerable degree basis theorem",
    "this subclass has a path of c.e",
    ".  degree .",
    "but every such real , being of diagonally non - computable turing degree , is turing complete by arslanov s completeness criterion , and hence computes a @xmath18-random .    in the present article we show that @xmath26 can be taken recursive in kleene s @xmath49 , but in general , for arbitrary @xmath50 classes ( or even just arbitrary @xmath51 classes ) , @xmath44 can not be taken hyperarithmetical .",
    "we expect the reader to be familiar with basic descriptive set theory and the effective part on hyperarithmetic sets and kleene s @xmath52 .",
    "standard references are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also assume basic knowledge of hausdorff measures and dimension , as can be found in @xcite or @xcite .      we will frequently need to generate sets of non - zero @xmath1-measure .",
    "the following `` coded - product '' construction presents a convenient method to do this",

    "[ davies ] suppose @xmath94 is @xmath2 .",
    "assume further that @xmath7 is not @xmath23-finite for @xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath7 is not a countable union of measurable sets of finite @xmath1-measure .",

    "the latter is possible since if there were no such @xmath110 , as @xmath114 , @xmath7 would be @xmath23-finite for @xmath1 , contradicting our assumption .",
