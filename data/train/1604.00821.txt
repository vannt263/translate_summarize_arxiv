    "a great deal of interest has been drawn to the discovery of quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulators , which were later identified as two dimensional ( 2d ) time - reversal invariant topological insulators @xcite .",
    "a topological insulator possesses a finite energy gap in bulk , whose low energy physics is characterized by topologically robust gapless ( spin polarized ) states at the edge ( surface ) .",
    "initially , such an exotic state was proposed in graphene @xcite , in which spin - orbit coupling is expected to open an energy gap in bulk and gives rise to counter - propagating gapless states at the edge . however , the spin - orbit coupling in graphene is too weak to induce an observable gap in experiment .",
    "the first realistic qsh insulator was theoretically proposed by bernevig et al .",
    "@xcite in a semiconductor cdte / hgte / cdte quantum well ( qw ) , and was confirmed in edge transport experiments @xcite .",
    "the second example for qsh insulator is the type ii inas / gasb qw proposed by liu et al .",
    "@xcite , which has been confirmed in experiments @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that highly quantized longitudinal conductance plateau has been observed in lightly si - doped inas / gasb qws @xcite .",
    "such a highly quantized conductance induced by dilute si - dopants was theoretically investigated by xu et al .",
    "@xcite . in their theory ,",
    "a single si dopant serves as a donor or acceptor and introduces a bound state inside the bulk energy gap , similar to a hydrogen - like bound state in a conventional semiconductor .",
    "their calculations show that the dilute si - dopants are very efficient to induce in - gap localized states .",
    "although the qsh system is considered to be protected by time - reversal symmetry , the edge states in inas / gaas qws are quite robust against an in - plane magnetic field up to 10 tesla @xcite and even higher @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the perpendicular magnetic field effects were studied in the context of hgte qws at first .",
    "it was demonstrated that hgte qws will undergo a qsh to quantum hall ( qh ) transition as the perpendicular magnetic field increases , which is controlled by the band inversion @xcite .",
    "it was also found that weak disorders will destroy the conductance plateau in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies on perpendicular magnetic field effects were carried out for inas / gasb qws as well @xcite .",
    "however , the robustness of edge state against the in - plane magnetic field is not well understood .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study the in - plane magnetic field effect in inas / gasb qws . at first sight",
    ", the in - plane magnetic field will result in zeeman splitting only and will not give rise to orbital effect in such a 2d system .",
    "nevertheless , it is not ture .",
    "becasue of the finite thickness of the inas / gasb interface , the orbital effect will dominate over zeeman effect despite the large value of land g - factor ( as large as 10 ) in the system@xcite .",
    "considering a finite spatial separation of the electron layer in inas and the hole layer in gasb , we can model the inas / gasb qw as a bilayer system .",
    "thus , the magnetic flux penetrating between the two layers is nonzero and will naturally give rise to orbital effect .",
    "we shall study how such orbital effect will modify the qsh system .",
    "moreover , the wide plateau in the quantized longitudinal conductance has also been observed in strained samples of inas / gasb qws in the absence of si - dopant @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the wide plateau in the quantized conductance in the qsh system is associated with the in - gap localized states , similar to the case in qh effect . in the previous theoretical studies",
    ", numerical calculation@xcite showed that strong anderson disorder in hgte qws may drive an ordinary insulating state into a topologically non - trivial state , which is called topological anderson insulator ( tai ) .",
    "this finding was confirmed by independent numerical simulations@xcite , and may be understood within the self - consistent born approximation@xcite .",
    "anderson type bond disorders were also investigated in qsh systems @xcite . however , previous theories have not explained the wide plateau of the quantized conductance in the presence of applied strain .",
    "this motivates us to study strain effect in inas / gasb qws .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we introduce an effective tight - binding model for inas / gasb qws and consider two types of disorders . the formalism to calculate the longitudinal conductance and density of states ( dos )",
    "is introduced as well . in section [ sec :",
    "magnetic ] , we utilize a bilayer model to study in - plane magnetic field in inas / gasb qws and focus on the robustness of helical edge states . in section [ sec : strain ] , we use a bond disorder to model the strain effect and study the in - gap localized states of the model .",
    "finally , we give a brief conclusion in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we begin with a pure system of bulk inas / gasb quantum wells in the absence of either external magnetic field or applied strain .",
    "such a system can be well described by the effective bhz model@xcite , which involves four relevant orbital states @xmath1 , where e and h label electron and hole states , respectively and @xmath2 denote pseudo - spins .",
    "the @xmath3 hamiltonian@xcite for the effective bhz model can be rewritten as a tight - biding model on a square lattice as follows@xcite ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the site index , @xmath6 are the four unit vectors of nearest neighbor bonds , @xmath7 denotes the pseudo - spin , and @xmath8 denotes the orbital .    since the pseudo - spin @xmath9 is conserved in a magnetic field @xmath10 , the @xmath11 matrices in eq.([eq : bhzmodel ] ) can be block diagonalized into two @xmath12 matrices . for a given @xmath9 , in the sub - hilbert space spanned by @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath14 is a diagonal matrix    @xmath15    and @xmath16 is given by the following matrix form @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are parameters , which determine the low energy band structure and will be given below .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , although the lattice constant in inas / gasb is about 0.6 nm , we can choose a different lattice constant in the tight - binding model by properly choosing parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , since it is an effective model derived from the @xmath3 hamiltonian .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we set the lattice constant as @xmath23 nm and choose @xmath24ev , @xmath25ev , @xmath26 , @xmath27ev and @xmath28v , where the terms representing bulk inversion asymmetry and structure inversion asymmetry have been neglected in @xmath10 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath29 guarantees that the system is in the topological insulating phase according to the fu - kane criterion@xcite .    to study conductance and the quantized plateau",
    ", we should consider disorders in the system . in this paper , we shall consider two types of disorders .",
    "the first one is that caused by impure atoms , for instance , si - dopant at the interface .",
    "we shall model this type of disorder using on - site impurities as follows , @xmath30 where the on - site potential @xmath31 is randomly distributed within a range of @xmath32 .",
    "we shall discuss how to choose @xmath31 in section [ sec : magnetic ] .",
    "the second type of disorder is the bond disorder .",
    "the inas / gasb quantum well is made of different crystal lattices , and we are interested in electrons and holes near the interface .",
    "lattice mismatch at the interface will give rise to inherent inhomogeneity , say , lattice distortion , and stress will enhance such distortion .",
    "so we have to consider such inhomogeneity when the strain is applied to the system .",
    "the lattice distortion will be non - uniform even though the system is clean itself , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bond - disorder - occur - sketch ] .",
    "we model the inhomogeneous effect by bond disorder as follows , @xmath33 where the correction to the hopping integral @xmath34 distributes randomly within a range , which will be discussed in details in section [ sec : strain ] .        in order to study transport and localization",
    ", we will calculate density of states ( dos ) @xmath35 and longitudinal conductance @xmath36 as a function of chemical potential using the recursive green s function method@xcite and landauer - b@xmath37ttiker - fisher - lee formula@xcite as in ref.@xcite .",
    "we consider a sample geometry consisting of @xmath38 rectangular region and two semi - infinite doped metallic leads connected to the rectangle along the @xmath39 direction .",
    "( to avoid redundant scattering from mismatched interfaces between the leads and the devices , we attach two clean and doped inas / gasb leads as the source and drain leads . )",
    "this setup allows us to study dos and the transport coefficients with both open boundary condition ( obc ) and periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) along the @xmath40 direction , namely , pbc can be used to study bulk states and obc can be used to study edge state transport .    for both pbc and opc ,",
    "the dos can be calculated by using the green s function @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the green s function of the @xmath5-th site along the @xmath39-direction , which can be evaluated by a recursive method@xcite .    for a generic system with the device and multiple connected terminals ( leads ) ,",
    "with the help of landauer - b@xmath37ttiker formula , the transmission coefficients between terminal p and q are a matrix , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is calculated via @xmath46 $ ] , and @xmath47 is the self - energy for lead @xmath48 . the green s function @xmath49 between lead @xmath50 and @xmath51 is defined as follows , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unit matrix , and @xmath54 can be chosen as @xmath55 or @xmath56 or their combination . to measure the longitudinal conductance , we only use two terminals in the above setup , say , @xmath57 .",
    "thus the longitudinal conductance @xmath36 can be written as @xmath58 it is worth noting that we can use similar setup with four terminals , say , two more leads connected to the two @xmath40-edges , to measure the transverse conductance @xmath59 too .    in the next sections , we shall study the effect of an external in - plane magnetic field as well as an applied strain to the transport properties .",
    "in general , a magnetic field will affect an electronic system in two ways .",
    "one is orbital effect and the other is the zeeman splitting . the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field has been studied in both hgte and inas / gasb quantum wells@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the perpendicular magnetic field will open an energy gap for the edge state at @xmath60 point . to estimate this , one can choose the magnetic field @xmath61 t . for hgte quantum wells , the effective g - factor is @xmath62@xcite , then the gap induced by orbital effect is about @xmath63mev , while the zeeman effect is about @xmath64mev .",
    "it means that the orbital effect will dominate over the zeeman spliting , and the later can be neglected in the analysis . for inas / gasb quantum wells , @xmath65@xcite , the orbital effect will still dominate in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field@xcite .    in the absence of external magnetic field ,",
    "there are helical edge states . both left - going and right - going channels will contribute to the quantized longitudinal conductance , resulting in @xmath66 . when the perpendicular magnetic field is strong enough",
    ", the left - going ( or right - going ) branch will merge with the bulk states , and the right - going ( or left - going ) branch will become chiral edge states . then the longitudinal conductance will become @xmath67@xcite . moreover , it was argued that the magnetic field will break time - reversal symmetry , thus the helical edge states are no longer symmetry - protected , disorders may localize the edge states and destroy the quantized conductance plateau@xcite",
    ".    we shall study in - plane magnetic field effect in this paper . at first glance , an in - plane magnetic field will cause zeeman splitting mainly and the orbital effect can be neglected , since quantum spin hall systems are quasi - two - dimensional . however , this simple judgment is not correct for inas / gasb quantum wells , which have a unique double - layered structure with electron and hole gases separated in two layers@xcite .",
    "this small but finite separation ( about @xmath68nm)@xcite will induce sizable orbital effect , which is much larger than the zeeman splitting . so that we shall neglect the zeeman splitting at first and examine its small correction finally .     and",
    "choose gauge @xmath69 , and also set the effective width of such a bilayer system as @xmath70.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    to model the separation of electron and hole gases , we utilize a bilayer square lattice illustrated in fig .",

    "the orbital effect of an external magnetic field can be introduced by the peierls substitution of hopping integrals @xmath72 between site @xmath5 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the magnetic flux quantum , and @xmath72 refer to the hopping matrix @xmath76 defined in eq.([eq : hopping - t - bhz ] ) .",
