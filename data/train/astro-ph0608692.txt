    "gravitational microlensing is nowadays a well established technique to map both visible and dark matter throughout the galaxy .",
    "the first lines of sight to be explored have been those towards the magellanic clouds and the bulge of the galaxy , leading to the observation of several hundreds of microlensing events ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of the observations , although debated and controversial , supports the existence in the galactic halo of machos ( massive astrophysical compact halo objects ) with mass of @xmath15 .",
    "microlensing events towards the bulge of the galaxy are interpreted as due to lenses prevalently belonging to the known stellar populations .",
    "however , several long - duration events towards the bulge have significant probabilities of being due to black hole ( bh ) lenses ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the light curve of a typical microlensing event depends on four parameters ( e.g. the mass @xmath16 of the lens , the observer - lens distance @xmath3 , the observer - source distance @xmath17 and the lens transverse velocity @xmath18 ) , while only two quantities are available from observations ( the amplification at maximum and the event duration ) .",
    "therefore , it remains a degeneracy in microlensing parameters , so that the lens mass can not be univocally determined , but only a statistical information can be obtained from the analysis of a large enough number of microlensing events .    the parameter degeneracy may be solved in a few parallax events , which are events with duration long enough to make possible to estimate @xmath3 and/or @xmath18 . in this case , a fit procedure to the event light curve allows to extract the value of the lens mass .",
    "this is the case of at least 22 microlensing parallax events @xcite observed by the macho collaboration towards the bulge of the galaxy . among these events three are particularly interesting : macho-96-blg-5 , macho-98-blg-6 and macho-99-blg-22 .",
    "for these three events , the lens mass has been estimated to be @xmath19 m@xmath2 , @xmath20 m@xmath2 @xcite , and @xmath21 m@xmath2 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the observed upper limit on the absolute brightness of these lenses is @xmath22 @xmath7 so the lenses can not be stars but are most likely bhs ) , macho-96-blg-5 is a marginal bh candidate ( @xmath23 ) and macho-98-blg-6 is a weak bh candidate ( @xmath24 ) . ]",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "stellar mass bhs there exist in the galaxy as a consequence of the evolution of massive stars , but all the candidates known up to date are members of binary systems . on the other hand , because of the shape of the microlensing light curves , we expect that the lens is an isolated object , so that the coordinates of these events give us the direction toward which pointing an @xmath8-ray instrument and acquire information on the lens nature",
    ".    indeed , the putative bh lens may be accreting interstellar gas and could be luminous in the x - ray band if it is within the thin gas layer of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "a first estimate of the x - ray flux in the 1 - 10 kev band leads to fluxes of @xmath25 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on a @xmath26 ks _ xmm _ observation towards the macho-96-blg-5 position , in order to search for an @xmath8-ray signature from the accretion process of the bh candidate .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "2 , we give a short description of the gravitational lensing event macho-96-blg-5 and in sect .",
    "4 we discuss about the @xmath8-ray observations performed towards the target by other @xmath8-ray telescopes . in sect .",
    "4 we report our observational results . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we address some conclusion .    before closing this section we would like to mention that detecting isolated bhs is of great importance in astrophysics since this should allow to validate or not the standard model for stellar evolution and bh formation - ray pulsar cxo j164710.2 - 455216 , indicating that pulsar progenitor had mass greater than about @xmath27 @xcite . ] .",
    "simple estimates indicate in fact that about @xmath28 bhs should be present throughout the galaxy ( se e.g. @xcite ) and this is in agrement with the chemical enrichment by supernovae indicating that about @xmath29 bhs should have formed @xcite .",
    "the macho and ogle groups claimed that three isolated bhs have been detected by gravitational microlensing indicating that at most @xmath30 bhs reside in the milky way disk ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the number of isolated bhs present in the galaxy should be confirmed by direct observations of their @xmath8-ray or radio emission @xcite .",
    "gravitational microlensing ( i.e. gravitational deflection and amplification ) of electromagnetic waves is a well known phenomenon predicted by the general theory of relativity . in presence of a massive object ( such as a macho , a star or a stellar mass bh ) close enough to the line of sight to a star ( source ) , an amplification of the received flux",
    "may be observed depending on the einstein radius @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath3 and @xmath17 being the lens and source distances , respectively . due to the relative transverse velocity @xmath18 between the lens and the line of sight to the source , the amplification is time - dependent and the duration time scale of a microlensing event is given by @xmath32 .    for most observed microlensing events ,",
    "the lens mass can only be estimated very crudely based upon the observed time @xmath33 . in fact , since @xmath17 is usually known and only two observed quantities ( the maximum amplification and @xmath33 ) are available from observations , it remains a degeneracy in microlensing parameters .    for long enough timescale events it is often possible to measure parallax effects which make possible to estimate the lens distance and/or its transverse velocity @xmath18 . in this case",
    ", a fit to the event light curve allows to extract the value of the lens mass . for these events ,",
    "the measurement of the projected speed of the lens allows to relate the lens mass and the source distance by @xmath34 from which it is possible to infer the lens mass once @xmath3 is known .    here , we focus on macho-96-blg-5 event whose parameters are given in table [ table1 ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "lllll ra(j2000 ) & dec(j2000 ) & @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 + @xmath38 & @xmath39&@xmath40&@xmath41&@xmath19 +    macho-96-blg-5 is a particularly long duration microlensing event so that parallax measurement have been performed allowing to determine the mass @xmath16 of the lens as a function of the distance @xmath3 ( see figure [ figure1 ] where we plot the mass @xmath16 as given by eq .",
    "( [ massa ] ) where we use the best fit parameters given in table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the region between the two dashed vertical lines corresponds to the lens mass best estimate @xmath1 m@xmath2 corresponding to distances between @xmath42 kpc and @xmath43  kpc .",
    "an isolated bh may accrete the surrounding interstellar material as a consequence of the deep gravitational potential .",
    "it is thus expected that an @xmath8-ray emission , although weak ( with respect to neutron stars of the same mass ) , is present .",
    "this has motivated us to search for an @xmath8-ray signature from the bh candidate in macho-96-blg-5 direction .",
    "if the bh is moving with velocity @xmath44 with respect to the interstellar medium it is expected to accrete at the bondi - hoyle accretion rate given by ( @xcite , see also @xcite for a more recent discussion ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a constant of order unity , @xmath47 is the sound velocity in the considered medium ( which is in the range @xmath48-@xmath49 km s@xmath13 ) and @xmath50 is the interstellar medium density .",
    "thus , the @xmath8-ray flux at earth is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a scale flux defined as @xmath53    assuming @xmath54 g @xmath55 ( corresponding to @xmath56 @xmath55 as expected for the interstellar matter density ) @xmath57 and @xmath58 km s@xmath13 ( as given by the microlensing event observation ) , @xmath59 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 .",
    "two observations have been carried out previously towards the macho-96-blg-5 coordinates by rosat and chandra satellites .",
    "@xcite have realized that the @xmath60 ks rosat observation in the @xmath61 kev @xcite made possible to detect @xmath62 and @xmath63 photons from a circular source region with a radius of @xmath64 and an annular background region with inner and outer radii of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . since the expected background counts result to be @xmath66 counts arcsec@xmath67 ,",
    "the number of background counts in the source circle is @xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds to a source count number as high as @xmath69 corresponding to a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath70 .",
    "this signal - to - noise ratio is marginally consistent with a source detection with a @xmath71 excess with a flux of @xmath72 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 in the @xmath61 kev band , or @xmath73 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 in the @xmath74 kev , where it has been assumed a photon index of @xmath5 and an absorption column density of @xmath75 @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8-ray signature from macho-96-blg-5 has been also searched for with a @xmath49 ks chandra observation @xcite . in this case , the chandra acis - s image in the @xmath74 kev band has shown that not even a single photon was detected within @xmath76 of the target position .",
    "in addition , @xmath77 counts have been detected within a circular region with @xmath78 radius centered on the macho-96-blg-5 source .",
    "hence , the background counts around the target are @xmath79 counts arcsec@xmath67 , which is consistent with the nondetection of source photons within @xmath76 from the macho-96-blg-5 position . using a simple poissonian distribution , maeda et al .",

    "assuming an interstellar column density of @xmath83 @xmath12 , @xcite found that the previous count estimate corresponds to fluxes of @xmath84 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 and @xmath85 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 , for photon index of @xmath86 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "a @xmath26 ks _ xmm _ observation towards the coordinates of macho-96-blg-5 has been made on october 2005 ( observation i d 30597 ) with both mos and pn cameras operating with thin filter mode .",
    "the epic observation data file ( odfs ) where processed using the _ xmm_-science analysis system ( sas version @xmath87 ) . with the latest calibration constituent files available in 2006 may , we have processed the raw data with the _ emchain _ and _ epchain _ tools to generate proper event list files .",
    "we then only considered events with patterns @xmath88 ( resp .",

    "we have used the _ evselect _ tool in order to extract light curves and images from the data . for our pointing , we have rejected time periods affected by soft protons flares which are evident , in the extracted light curves , as spikes . for this purpose , we built light curves for the mos and pn instruments at energies above @xmath49 kev ( in particular in the energy band @xmath49 kev - @xmath91 kev ) where the effect of soft protons flares is more evident .",
    "these data were recursively cleaned by removing all bins with counts larger than @xmath92 from the mean . new mean and new deviation",
    "are then found and the entire process has been repeated until a mean count rate per bin is reached .",
    "this procedure , when applied to mos and pn data , allowed us to discard high background observing periods on the basis of the derived thresholds of @xmath93 counts ( or 0.225 counts sec@xmath13 ) for mos 1 , @xmath94 counts ( or 0.26 counts sec@xmath13 ) for mos 2 and @xmath95 counts ( or 0.490 counts sec@xmath13 ) for pn , respectively .",
    "hence , with the _ tabgtigen _ tool , good time intervals ( gtis ) were obtained and used in order to produce adequate @xmath8-ray event lists for each instruments .",
