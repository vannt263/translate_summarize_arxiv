    "separation of variables is one of the oldest techniques in mathematical physics , which still remains one of the most effective and powerful tools in the theory of integrable systems .",
    "its quantum version initiated by lam @xcite is actually more natural than the classical one developed approximately at the same time by jacobi @xcite , when one has to consider the hamilton - jacobi equation rather than the equations of motion .",
    "the general theory of separation coordinates goes back to stckel @xcite and levi - civita @xcite and was developed further by eisenhart @xcite . in the particular case of the sphere @xmath0 , which we will be interested in , the first ( and the most important ) example , that of elliptic coordinates , was introduced already in 1859 by c.  neumann @xcite .",
    "the classification problem of all separation coordinates on @xmath0 had been studied in detail by olevski @xcite and kalnins & miller @xcite . in particular , in the last paper to describe the answer the authors used a sophisticated graphical procedure similar to the one developed by vilenkin to describe the polyspherical coordinates @xcite .    despite all these advances almost nothing",
    "has been known about the global geometry of the space of separation coordinates . in the present paper",
    "we fill this gap by describing the topology and algebraic geometry of this space in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we link the graphical procedures from @xcite and @xcite with the rich combinatorial theory of _ associahedra _ , or _",
    "stasheff polytopes _ , introduced by stasheff in 1963 in homotopy theory @xcite .",
    "the reason this has never been done before is probably that the algebraic equations involved seemed far too complicated for a direct solution .",

    "more precisely , we prove the following result .    the stckel systems on @xmath0 with diagonal algebraic curvature tensor form a smooth projective variety isomorphic to the real deligne - mumford - knudsen moduli space @xmath1 of stable genus zero curves with @xmath2 marked points .",
    "as a corollary we have that the set @xmath7 of equivalence classes of separation coordinates on the sphere @xmath0 modulo the orthogonal group is in one - to - one correspondence with the quotient space @xmath8 .",

    "in particular , we use the mosaic operad @xcite to give an explicit construction for stckel systems and separation coordinates .    note that in this way we establish ( and exploit ) a surprising correspondence between two seemingly completely unrelated objects  separation coordinates on a sphere on one hand and stable genus zero curves with marked points on the other hand  revealing yet another guise of the famous moduli space @xmath11 .",
    "the algebraic nature of the problem of separation of variables was explicitly revealed in @xcite , where the nijenhuis integrability conditions for killing tensors were reduced to purely algebraic equations for the associated algebraic curvature tensors .",
    "the statement of the main theorem stems from a thorough analysis of these equations in the first non - trivial case @xmath5 , done in @xcite .",

    "we show that the killing tensors on @xmath0 with diagonal algebraic curvature tensor satisfy the defining relations of the kohno - drinfeld lie algebra , which allows us to make the link with the main result of @xcite .",
    "recall that the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath14 _ separates _ in local coordinates @xmath15 on a riemannian manifold @xmath16 if it admits a solution of the form @xmath17 depending on @xmath6 parameters @xmath18 .",
    "note that if we reparametrise each coordinate @xmath19 with a strictly monotonic function @xmath20 , the hamilton - jacobi equation is still separable in the new coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "the same is true for a permutation of the variables . in order to avoid this arbitrariness",

    "the separation coordinates are called _ orthogonal _ , if the normals of these hypersurfaces are mutually orthogonal .",

    "their importance in our context stems from the fact that @xmath104 defines a killing tensor , as one immediately checks , and the fact that every killing tensor of this form is contained in a stckel system .",
    "the latter follows easily from the nijenhuis integrability conditions applied to @xmath36 ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "we can deduce the corresponding separation coordinates directly from the special conformal killing tensor @xmath105 , since its eigenvalues are constant on the corresponding coordinate hypersurfaces @xcite .",
    "this means that the eigenvalues of @xmath105 can be taken as coordinate functions . on @xmath109",
    "the situation is further simplified .",
    "the reason is that under certain conditions , which are met in this case , every special conformal killing tensor @xmath105 on @xmath46 is the restriction of a covariantly constant symmetric tensor @xmath110 on the metric cone over @xmath46 and vice versa ( see for example @xcite ) . here",

    "therefore elliptic coordinates form an @xmath117-parameter family of separation coordinates on @xmath0 .",
    "the other extreme , having no continuous parameters at all , are _ polyspherical coordinates _ considered by vilenkin @xcite .",
    "each of these coordinate systems is given in terms of cartesian coordinates by starting with @xmath118 on @xmath119 and then defining recursively @xmath120 on @xmath121 from @xmath122 on @xmath123 and @xmath124 on @xmath125 by setting @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",

    "the total number of canonical forms for separation coordinates on @xmath0 , indicated in the last column in table  [ tab : numbers ] , is the number of dyslexic planar rooted trees with @xmath166 leaves @xcite .      the correspondence in theorem  [ thm : iso ] transfers the natural operad structure on @xmath1 to orthogonal separation coordinates on @xmath0 and thereby yields a uniform construction procedure for separation coordinates on spheres .",

    "just start with trivial coordinates @xmath290 on a certain number of zero dimensional spheres @xmath291 and take elliptic coordinates for @xmath292 in each step .",
    "the different choices one has when iterating this composition are given by the trees labelling the corresponding separation coordinates .",
    "that is , the rooted trees describe the hierarchy of iterated decompositions of a sphere as joins of lower dimensional spheres .",
    "this parallels the decomposition of the faces of a stasheff polytope into products of lower dimensional stasheff polytopes .",
    "note that the construction of vilenkin s polyspherical coordinates on @xmath128 corresponds to the special case @xmath293 of the above construction , starting from trivial coordinates @xmath294 on @xmath6 copies of @xmath291 and using the ( elliptic ) coordinates @xmath295 on @xmath296 in each step .",
    "moreover , this operad structure on separation coordinates also explains kalnins & miller s graphical procedure @xcite .",
    "namely , adding in an `` irreducible block '' a leaf to each box which is not joined to another block and replacing each irreducible block by a node , the graphs in @xcite become the trees arising from the operad structure .",
    "we now explain how this operad structure manifests itself on the level of stckel systems . to this end , let @xmath297 be a partition of @xmath298 with @xmath299 and set @xmath300 .",
    "we denote by @xmath301 the space of killing tensors on @xmath128 with diagonal algebraic curvature tensor and define the injections @xmath302    let @xmath303 be a stckel system on @xmath304 and @xmath305 be stckel systems on @xmath306 for @xmath286 , all consisting of killing tensors with diagonal algebraic curvature tensor .",

    "this is evident . for @xmath313 one",
