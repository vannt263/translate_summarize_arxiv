    "since its discovery in 2012 summer , the 126-gev higgs boson has attracted a lot of interest in studying its detailed properties .",
    "most of such studies are trying to address the question whether it is exactly the one predicted by the standard model ( sm ) or , equivalently , whether it is one of scalar bosons in models with an extension of the higgs sector .",
    "an extended higgs sector generally leads to a modification of cross sections of various sm processes due to an effect of additional higgs bosons .",
    "it is therefore an important program to study how we can extract the structure of the higgs sector from modified cross sections .",
    "recently , the atlas collaboration presented the first measurement of the @xmath0 process with leptonic decays of the @xmath1 bosons based on their @xmath4 fb@xmath5 collision data at @xmath6 tev  @xcite .",
    "they determined the production cross sections in both inclusive and vector boson scattering ( vbs ) fiducial regions , with the latter being a subset of the former and more sensitive to electroweak processes .",
    "such data provide constraints on the size of effective @xmath2 vertex that can be significantly modified by mediations of doubly - charged higgs bosons @xmath7 ; i.e. , @xmath8 through the @xmath9 couplings .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath9 couplings is proportional to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of an additional higgs multiplet with a representation larger than the isospin doublet .",
    "usually , such a vev is constrained to be smaller than a few gev by the electroweak @xmath10 parameter , as is the case in , _",
    "e.g. _ , the minimal higgs triplet model  @xcite . in this case , the modification in the quartic @xmath1 boson coupling is sufficiently small to be neglected .",
    "however , this constraint is circumvented in the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite in which a pair of complex and real triplet fields with vacuum alignment are introduced , thereby preserving the custodial symmetry and permitting an o(10 ) gev triplet vev process is negligible , and the pair production @xmath11 and the associated production with singly - charged higgs bosons @xmath12 can be used for the @xmath7 production at the lhc . from the same - sign dilepton data at the lhc with the collision energy to be 7 tev , the",
    "lower bound for the mass of @xmath7 has been derived to be about 400 gev  @xcite and about 60 gev  @xcite when @xmath7 mainly decay into the same - sign leptons and dibosons , respectively . ] .",
    "even though a higgs sector with an isospin septet field also maintains @xmath13 at tree level  @xcite , it has an accidental u(1 ) symmetry that could lead to an unwanted nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson once it is spontaneously broken .",
    "we therefore consider the gm model as the minimal well - defined model .",
    "in addition to large @xmath9 vertices , such a large triplet vev also gives rise to sizeable @xmath14 vertices , where @xmath15 are physical singly - charged higgs bosons .",
    "the @xmath14 vertices are known to be small in multi - doublet models , because they appear at loop levels  @xcite .",
    "the size of the vertices is also suppressed in the minimal higgs triplet model due to the small triplet vev , similar to the case of @xmath9 vertices .",
    "thus , the measurement of @xmath16 vertices is another probe of the gm model .",
    "the feasibility studies of measuring the @xmath16 vertices have been done in refs .",
    "@xcite for the lhc , and in refs .",
    "@xcite for future linear colliders .",
    "furthermore , the large triplet vev deviates the coupling constants for the sm - like higgs boson @xmath17 with the weak gauge bosons @xmath18 and the fermions @xmath19 from their sm values . unlike the higgs sector composed of only singlets and doublets , the @xmath18 couplings can be larger than the sm predictions as a result of the larger isospin representation , serving as a distinctive feature of the gm model .    in this work",
    ", we compare the cross section of the vbs region driven by the data with its prediction in the gm model .",
    "we then show that a significant portion of the parameter space has been ruled out by the atlas data .",
    "we also estimate the discovery reach for the new higgs bosons using the same process at the 14-tev lhc . based on the above constraint",
    ", one can find an upper bound on the triplet vev for each given mass of the new higgs bosons .",
    "this upper bound in turn determines possible ranges of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 coupling constants and thus the signal strengths for the @xmath20 modes in a very predictive way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . the gm model is briefly reviewed in section  [ sec : gm ] .",
    "section  [ sec : lhc ] shows our primary results based on the latest atlas data .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the higgs sector in the gm model is composed of an isospin doublet field , @xmath21 , with hypercharge @xmath22 , a complex triplet field , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , and a real triplet field , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , where the electric charge @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the third component of the isospin .",
    "these fields can be expressed in the @xmath30 covariant form as : @xmath31 the neutral components are parameterized as @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the vev s of @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 , respectively . under the @xmath36 symmetry , the most general higgs potential contains four dimensionful and five dimensionless parameters , and its explicit form can be found , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the two triplet fields develop aligned vev s , @xmath37 , the @xmath30 symmetry reduces to the custodial @xmath38 symmetry . in that case , the @xmath1 boson mass @xmath39 and the @xmath40 boson mass @xmath41 have the same form as in the sm ; i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is related to the fermi constant @xmath45 by @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the weak mixing angle .",
    "therefore , the electroweak @xmath10 parameter defined by @xmath48 is unity at tree level .",
    "the component scalar fields can be classified into irreducible representations of @xmath38 multiplets .",
    "the scalar fields from the doublet @xmath49 are decomposed as @xmath50 , and those from the triplet @xmath51 as @xmath52 . as a result",
    ", we have one 5-plet , two 3-plet and two singlet representations , where the latter two can mix with each other with mixing angles @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the mixing angle @xmath53 is defined by @xmath55 , while @xmath54 is determined by the quartic coupling constants in the higgs potential .",
    "the 5-plet states are physical and denoted by ( @xmath56 ) . on the other hand , one linear combination of the two 3-plets corresponds to the ng bosons ( @xmath57 ) that become the longitudinal components of the @xmath1 and @xmath40 bosons , respectively .",
    "the other linear combination gives the physical 3-plet higgs bosons ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "furthermore , after diagonalizing the mass matrix for the two @xmath38 singlet fields , we obtain two cp - even neutral higgs bosons .",
    "one of them should be identified as the 126-gev higgs boson at the lhc . due to the custodial symmetry ,",
    "higgs bosons belonging to the same @xmath38 multiplet are degenerate in mass .",
    "seven of the nine parameters in the higgs potential can be converted into the following physical parameters : four mass parameters for the 5-plet , 3-plet and two singlet higgs bosons , one mixing angle @xmath54 , and two vev s @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the remained two parameters , which are given as the coefficients of the trilinear scalar vertices , enter the mass formulas of the higgs bosons .",
    "one can tune the two parameters to realize the decoupling limit , where the 5-plet , 3-plet and one of the singlet higgs bosons are much heavier than the electroweak scale .",
    "these parameters can be constrained by such theoretical arguments as perturbative unitarity  @xcite and vacuum stability  @xcite .    in the following , we summarize a few characteristic features of the gm model .",
    "first , the triplet vev @xmath60 can be @xmath61(10 ) gev , with an upper limit of about 80 gev as required by the perturbativity of the top yukawa coupling .",
    "such a large triplet vev gives rise to distinctive phenomenology in collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "second , the @xmath18 couplings ( @xmath62 ) for the sm - like higgs boson @xmath17 can be larger than their sm values .",
    "the ratios of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 couplings to their respective sm values are given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are respectively @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it is the group factor @xmath72 in @xmath73 that makes it possible for the @xmath18 couplings to be larger than their sm values .",
    "this feature is not shared by models extended with only multi - doublets and/or singlets .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 is one crucial signature to identify the gm model , particularly when @xmath60 is sizeable .    finally , the 3-plet higgs bosons are  fermion - philic \" ; _ i.e. _ , they couple to fermions due to their components from @xmath49 through mixing , but they do not couple to the weak gauge bosons .",
    "in fact , properties of the 3-plet higgs bosons are quite similar to those of the cp - odd and singly - charged higgs bosons in the type - i two higgs doublet model .",
    "its phenomenology has been studied a lot in the literature  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the 5-plet higgs bosons are `` gauge - philic '' ; namely , they have interactions with the weak gauge bosons , but they do not couple to sm fermions because they involve purely components in the @xmath51 field .",
    "thus , they decay dominantly into gauge boson pairs  .",
    "magnitudes of the 5-plet higgs couplings with the weak bosons are all proportional to @xmath60 : @xmath75 when @xmath60 is large , cross sections of the vbs processes can be significantly modified due to the mediation of the 5-plet higgs bosons through the above vertices .",
    "we therefore expect the cross section measured by atlas to impose a strong constraint on the model .",
    "for the same - sign diboson process of @xmath76 with @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) measured by the atlas  @xcite , the 5-plet higgs bosons @xmath79 and @xmath80 can contribute through @xmath81-channel and @xmath82-channel , respectively . for definiteness , we fix the @xmath18 couplings at their sm values .",
    "we have checked that the vbs cross section varies by less than 1% when the @xmath18 couplings are changed by @xmath83 and , therefore , the bound on @xmath60 is essentially unchanged within the range . under this assumption",
    ", the modification of the vbs cross section of @xmath76 process depends only on @xmath60 and @xmath84 , the mass of @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the signal events are classified as the inclusive region and the vbs region . in both of the cases ,",
    "the following basic kinematic cuts are imposed : @xmath85 where @xmath86 , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the transverse mass and pseudorapidity for @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the distance between @xmath89 and @xmath90 is denoted by @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the missing transverse energy .",
    "the signal events for the inclusive region are obtained by only taking the above cuts . for the vbs region ,",
    "one further imposes the following cut : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the rapidity difference between the dijets .",
    "we note that the cross section of the inclusive region includes contributions from both electroweak and strong processes , while that of the vbs region mainly the electroweak processes due to the cut in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rapidity ] ) . from the measured @xmath95 events and monte carlo background simulations ,",
    "the fiducial cross sections for the inclusive and vbs regions are respectively derived to be 2.1@xmath960.5(stat)@xmath960.3(sys ) fb and 1.3@xmath960.4(stat)@xmath960.2(sys ) fb  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding sm cross sections quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite are 1.52@xmath96 0.11 fb and 0.95@xmath960.06",
    "therefore , the sm predictions are consistent with the measured fiducial cross sections within 1@xmath97 .    in the following numerical analysis , we use madgraph5  @xcite for simulations and cteq6l for the parton distribution functions . before comparing the cross sections in the gm model with the fiducial values ,",
    "we first calibrate the sm cross sections .",
    "our sm simulations give the inclusive cross section as 1.66 fb and the vbs cross section as 1.06 fb .",
    "we will thus multiply the factors 0.92  ( = 1.52 fb/1.66 fb ) and 0.90  ( = 0.95 fb/1.06 fb ) to the cross sections simulated in our analysis in the inclusive and vbs regions , respectively . we confirm that the vbs region has a better sensitivity than the inclusive region .",
    "for example , using the analysis based on the vbs ( inclusive ) region , we obtain in the case of @xmath98 gev the upper limit of 27 gev ( 32 gev ) at the 68% cl and 33 gev ( 40 gev ) at the 95% cl for @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the vbs cross section in the following analysis .         the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : vba ] shows the excluded parameter region on the @xmath84- @xmath60 plane according to the current 20.3 fb@xmath5 data of 8-tev lhc .",
    "the region above the black ( red ) curve is excluded at the 68% ( 95% ) cl .",
    "the most severe upper bound on @xmath60 is about 30 gev at the 95% cl in the case of @xmath98 gev .",
    "when a larger value of @xmath84 is taken , the bound on @xmath60 becomes more relaxed due to smaller production cross sections .",
    "when @xmath84 is taken to be smaller than about 200 gev , a milder bound on @xmath60 is also obtained , as more events from the 5-plet higgs bosons are rejected by the kinematic cuts in eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) . as a comparison",
    ", we also show by the green dashed curve in this plot the constraint from the measurement of @xmath99  @xcite , which depends on the mass of 3-plet higgs bosons @xmath100 and @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the region above the dashed curve is excluded at 95% cl .    by applying the same analysis for the vbs region to the case of 14-tev collisions ,",
    "one can calculate expected cross section deviations from the sm predictions for different luminosities . in the right plot of fig .  [",
    "fig : vba ] , we show the expected 5-sigma reach for excess in the @xmath101 process at the 14-tev lhc on the @xmath84- @xmath60 plane . the integrated luminosity is assumed to be 30 , 100 and 300 fb@xmath5 for the three curves .",
    "similar to the analysis of 8-tev data , the discovery reach becomes the largest at around @xmath98 gev , where a 5-sigma discrepancy is expected in the cases of @xmath102 , 17 and 12 gev for the luminosity of 30 , 100 , 300 , and 3000 fb@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the constraint from @xmath103 is also displayed in this plot .",
    "-@xmath60 plane marks the region where @xmath104 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ mu_vv ] ) , are within @xmath105 .",
    "the contours for the @xmath18 coupling ratio , @xmath73 , and those for the @xmath106 coupling ratio , @xmath107 , are also superimposed as blue dashed and red dotted curves , respectively .",

    "[ fig : mu_vv ] shows the contours of signal strengths for the @xmath108 channel defined by @xmath109 from the gluon fusion production mechanism , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are respectively the gluon fusion cross section and the branching ratio of the @xmath108 decay .",
    "it is seen that even in the case with @xmath112 as favored by the current lhc data , there are regions with @xmath113 .",
    "this is because the enhancement in @xmath111 is compensated by the suppression in the gluon fusion cross section due to @xmath114 .",
    "this signifies the importance of studying the vbs process in addition to the gluon fusion process in order to reliably fix the exact values of @xmath18 and @xmath106 couplings .",
    "signatures of enhanced vbs processes in the gm model at the lhc had been studied in ref .",

    "the @xmath18 couplings are supposed to be measured at about 1 % accuracy  @xcite with the 500-gev collisions and an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath5 . by combining the independent measurements of @xmath115 at the hl - lhc and the @xmath18 couplings at the ilc",
    ", we will be able to determine parameters of the gm model , such as @xmath54 and masses of extra higgs bosons   is found in future experiments , one can obtain upper limits on the masses of extra higgs bosons from the unitarity and vacuum stability bounds  @xcite . ]",
    "even if we can not directly discover them at the early stage .",
    "we have studied the constraint on the gm model based on the first measurement of the same - sign diboson process @xmath0 by the atlas collaboration . in the gm model ,",
    "the doubly - charged and neutral higgs bosons in the @xmath38 5-plet contribute to the above process .",
    "because the gauge - gauge - scalar vertices for the 5-plet higgs bosons are all proportional to the triplet vev @xmath60 , we have established the excluded parameter space on the @xmath84-@xmath60 plane .",

    "we have also analyzed the expected 5-sigma reach for the same process at the 14-tev lhc . as an example , assuming the integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath5 , we expect a 5-sigma deviation for @xmath116 12 , 19 and 38 gev when @xmath98 , 500 and 1000 gev , respectively .",
