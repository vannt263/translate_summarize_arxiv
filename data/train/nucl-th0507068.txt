    "the study of isospin effects in nuclear matter or finite nuclei is a well established topic in nuclear physics , as well as in nuclear astrophysics @xcite . on the mean field level , this means the contribution of the symmetry energy of particles to the total energy ( see , e.g. , the recent refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and on the two - body collision level , detailed experimental data on the free proton - proton and neutron - proton scattering cross sections have been obtained @xcite as a function of energy ranging from the coulomb barrier to ultra high energy interactions . at low energies ( up to several hundreds of mev / nucleon ) , large differences are visible between the proton - proton and the neutron - proton cross sections . in heavy ion collisions ( hics ) , it is also necessary to study the effect of density on the isospin - dependent nucleon - nucleon cross sections .",
    "recently , we have explored the density- and temperature - dependence of the nucleon - nucleon elastic scattering cross sections in collisions between neutron - rich nuclei at intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "we found a density dependence of the elastic scattering cross sections .",
    "this work is based on the theory of quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) , in which the interaction between nucleons is described by the exchange of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 mesons . since",
    ", in the qhd theory , both the mean field and the collision term originate from the same lagrangian density , the density - dependence of the symmetry energy is our next subject to investigate .",
    "currently the exploration of the isospin dependence of the nuclear interaction ( especially in exotic and very isospin - asymmetric systems ) has gained high interest @xcite .",
    "in particular , the density dependence of the symmetry energy in _ dense _ nuclear matter has to be studied in detail , because it suffers from large uncertainties in the predictions of various theoretical models @xcite . based on the qhd theory , with a similar effective lagrangian density @xcite , the main uncertainty of the density dependence of the symmetry energy results from the uncertainties of the density - dependent coupling strengths of various meson - baryon interactions , especially that of @xmath12 and @xmath13 interactions @xcite . also , in forthcoming experiments at the rare isotope accelerator ( ria ) laboratory ( usa ) and at the new international accelerator facility fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) at the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi , germany ) , more neutron - rich beams are planned to be adopted , and hence call for further theoretical studies on isospin - dependent hics in the intermediate energy region .    in order to obtain detailed information on the density dependence of the symmetry energy in dense nuclear matter",
    ", quite a few sensitive probes were brought up for experiments in recent years : e.g. , the @xmath5 yield ratio , the pion flow , the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath5 ratios , the neutron - proton differential flow @xcite , and the isospin equilibration and stopping @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have also investigated @xcite the sensitivity of the @xmath14 ratio on the density - dependent symmetry potentials .",
    "further investigations seem to be worthwhile to shed light on the rather unclear isospin - independent and -dependent mean - field potentials of the hyperons .",
    "since the contribution of the symmetry energy to the whole dynamics of hics is rather small at schwerionen synchrotron ( sis ) energies , it is all the more difficult to explore the density dependence of the symmetry energy based on the current experimental situation .",
    "hence , in theory , more sensitive probes should be searched for .    also , such a detailed analysis is quite necessary and important because of the following arising questions : is the effect of the density - dependent symmetry energy on the @xmath15 ratio influenced by the beam energy ?",
    "in which momentum , rapidity , or phase - space , region are the pion yields more suitable to probe the density - dependent symmetry energy ? and , how does the coulomb potential of mesons affect the emission of pions ?",
    "_ @xcite found that for beam energies higher than about @xmath16 gev , the sensitivity of the @xmath17 ratio to the form of the symmetry energy at high densities is strongly reduced .",
    "furthermore , they found that the @xmath5 ratio at high transverse momenta @xmath18 could offer sound information on the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "b .- a . li _",
    "@xcite revisited the @xmath5 ratio by using an up - dated , new version of the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu04 ) model , in which an isospin- and momentum - dependent single nucleon potential was adopted .",
    "they found that the sensitivity of the @xmath5 ratio on the density - dependence of the symmetry energy becomes obvious after considering the momentum - dependent single nucleon potential .",
    "they also noticed the effect of the coulomb potential on the @xmath19 production , especially on the transverse momentum spectra . their work implied that it is sufficient to measure accurately the low - energy ( or the low - transverse - momentum @xmath18 ) pions , instead of the whole spectrum .",
    "in this paper , we address these aspects of the problem on the basis of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model .    in this work",
    ", we also investigate the @xmath20 production ratio as a probe of the density - dependent symmetry potential in dense nuclear matter .",
    "based on the constituent quark picture the @xmath21 meson contains one @xmath22-quark while the @xmath23 contains one @xmath24-quark , as well as one @xmath25-quark in each meson .",
    "this is closely related to the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear medium at sis energies . furthermore , experimentally , the effects of system parameters , such as beam energy or impact parameter , on the sensitive probes also have to be kept in mind .",
    "theoretically , the uncertainty of the isospin - independent nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , as well as the contribution of the coulomb potential of mesons , might alter the calculated results of these probes , hence , they could even modify the conclusions and should be checked carefully .    in the urqmd model ( version 1.3 )",
    "@xcite , adopted here , we find that most of the calculations can simultaneously reproduce many experimental measurements , which offers a good starting point for studying the isospin effects at sis energies . in this work , a hard and a soft skyrme - type eos , without momentum dependence",
    ", are adopted for central ( @xmath26 ) or near - peripheral ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 reactions at beam energies @xmath29 and @xmath30 gev .",
    "we consider phenomenological density - dependent symmetry potentials , which will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the coulomb potentials of the mesons are switched on or off in order to analyze more conveniently the contributions of the various symmetry potentials to the dynamical evolution of the hadrons in the nuclear medium .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section ii , we clarify the inclusion of the isospin - dependent part of the mean field in the urqmd transport model . in section iii , some basic isospin effects on the dynamics of the baryons ( here the nucleons and @xmath31 ) in sis energy hics are shown . in section iv ,",
    "firstly the effects of the isospin - independent eos , the beam energy , and the impact parameter on the emitted pion yields and the @xmath5 production ratios are discussed .",
    "then , the various phase - space distributions of pion yields and the @xmath5 ratios , with the different density dependences of the symmetry potentials , are investigated . at the end of this section",
    ", the sensitivity of the @xmath20 ratio to the density dependence of the symmetry potential is discussed .",
    "finally , the conclusions and outlook are given in section v.",
    "the initialization of neutrons and protons , the corresponding pauli blocking , the coulomb potential of baryons , and the isospin dependence of the nucleon - nucleon cross sections have been introduced explicitly in the standard urqmd model . in order to study the isospin effects in intermediate energy hics ,",
    "it is required to further introduce the symmetry potential of baryons .",
    "the isospin - dependent eos for asymmetric nuclear matter can be expressed as ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the reduced nuclear density and @xmath34 is the isospin asymmetry in terms of neutron ( @xmath35 ) and proton ( @xmath36 ) densities .",
    "the @xmath37 term is the isospin - independent part , which includes the skyrme and the yukawa potentials in the urqmd model @xcite .",
    "the yukawa parameter is related to the skyrme parameters since in infinite nuclear matter the contribution of the yukawa potential to the total energy acts like a two - body skyrme contribution . for comparison ,",
    "both a soft ( @xmath38 mev ) and a hard ( @xmath39 mev , the default parametrization in this work ) eos are adopted in this work .",
    "@xmath40 is the symmetry energy per nucleon , in which the kinetic ( @xmath41 ) and potential ( @xmath42 ) contributions are included .",
    "the average symmetry potential energy can be expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the symmetry - potential strength and @xmath45 is the density - dependent part . if the fermi - gas model is adopted , the symmetry - potential strength @xmath46 is related to the symmetry energy at normal density , @xmath47 , by @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the fermi kinetic energy at normal nuclear density .",
    "the relativistic mean field calculations @xcite show a small variation of the symmetry kinetic energy extracted from various models , and the uncertainty of the symmetry energy with nuclear density results mainly from the symmetry potential energy . concerning the symmetry potential energy , both the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath47 and the density dependence of the symmetry energy are quite uncertain . for @xmath47 , deduced from the isovector gdr in @xmath50 and from the available data of differences between neutron and proton radii for @xmath50 and several @xmath51 isotopes ,",
    "a rather small range of values is @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "more recently , a new value of @xmath53 mev was obtained , based on the consistent folding analysis of the @xmath54 elastic scattering and @xmath55 charge exchange reaction data measured at @xmath56 mev @xcite , while @xmath57 mev was obtained in a calculation made within the relativistic brueckner framework , using the bonn a potential @xcite .",
    "thus , it is necessary to further investigate the uncertainty of the @xmath47 value @xcite . in this paper , however , the value @xmath57 mev is adopted , since we endeavor to investigate the density dependence of the symmetry potential energy .    in order to mimic the strong density dependence of the symmetry potential at high densities , we adopt the form of @xmath45 , used in @xcite , as @xmath58 here , @xmath59 is the strength of the density dependence of the symmetry potential .",
    "we choose @xmath60 and @xmath61 , denoted as the symmetry potentials f05 and f15 , respectively . @xmath62 ( in f@xmath63 ) is the reduced critical density ; for @xmath64 , the symmetry potential energy is negative .",
    "we adopt @xmath65 in this paper and the respective symmetry potential is named as fa3 .",
    "the symmetry potentials f05 , f15 , and fa3 are shown in fig .",

    "this means that for neutron - rich hics at intermediate energies , less neutrons are pushed into the low density region ( @xmath66 ) as well as into the high density region ( @xmath68 ) for density dependence fa3 , as compared to f05 . in other words ,",
    "the symmetry - potential parametrization f05 is always stiffer than fa3 ( at both subnormal and higher densities ) , except at normal nuclear density .    besides nucleons ( n )",
    ", the resonances n@xmath69(1440 ) , @xmath70(1232 ) , and the hyperons @xmath71 and @xmath72 should be considered for sis energy hics , where the @xmath70(1232 ) is dominating , denoted as @xmath70 in short . for simplicity ,",
    "the isospin - independent part of the eos , @xmath37 , for all other baryons is taken to be the same as for the nucleons .",
    "the symmetry potentials for the resonances are obtained through the constants of isospin coupling ( the clebsch - gordan coefficients ) in the process of @xmath70 [ or @xmath73 @xmath74 . for hyperons , based on the analysis of the lane potential @xcite",

    "thus , in this paper , we also investigate the contribution of the coulomb potentials between mesons and baryons .",

    "the beam energies are @xmath29 and @xmath30 gev and central collisions ( @xmath26 ) are chosen . from this plot , we notice that independent of the choice of the density dependence of the symmetry potential , the neutron numbers reach their minima at @xmath86 and @xmath87 , for the beam energies @xmath29 and @xmath30 gev , respectively . at this time the central nuclear density reaches its maximum and",
    "some of the neutrons are excited ( to n@xmath69 or @xmath70 ) or converted to other baryons ( e.g. , hyperons ) through various baryon - baryon or meson - baryon collisions .",
    "we also notice that the higher the beam energy , the more excited baryon states are produced .",
    "there are obviously less excited protons than neutrons at the compression stage . in other words , at the compression stage , the effect on the neutron number is stronger than on the proton number , which is due to the neutron - rich nuclear environment . after the decay of these unstable baryons , the emitted mesons ( especially , the pions ) alter the neutron / proton ratio ( the neutron number decreases , and , correspondingly , the proton number increases ) , and hence the ratio tends to become unity with an increase of the beam energy .",
    "in addition the effect of the density - dependent symmetry potentials on the dynamical process is smaller at higher energies @xcite . with a softer symmetry potential fa3 ,",
    "more neutrons are excited at the compression stage , which is clearly due to more neutrons being kept by the softer symmetry potential in the high density region , as implied from fig.[fig1 ] .",

    ", the density dependence of the symmetry potential influences the neutron / proton ratio strongly , whereas at @xmath94 gev the sensitivity is reduced , especially at midrapidity .",
    "this happens not only due to the relatively weak effect of the eos , as compared to the two - body collision dynamics , but also due to the nucleon - nucleon cross sections at higher energies that depend less on isospin .",
    "secondly , in the projectile and target rapidity regions , the @xmath95 ratio is more sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry potential as compared to the midrapidity region .",
    "less collisions take place in the projectile and target rapidity regions than in the midrapidity region ( see also , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath95 ratio is larger with a softer symmetry potential fa3 than that with f15 , and vice versa in the projectile - target regions .",
    "the nucleons in the midrapidity region represent mainly the behavior of symmetry potential at high densities , where more neutrons are kept with a soft symmetry potential .",
    "we should also notice that at midrapidity , the difference of the ratios with the f05 and fa3 symmetry potentials is almost negligible . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we can see that f05 is always stiffer than fa3 at both low and high densities , thus the @xmath95 ratio is also influenced by the density dependence of the symmetry potential at subnormal densities .",

[ fig3 ] .",

    "the @xmath0 ratio decreases with time while it increases at the later stage , the expansion stage .",
    "this is apparently due to the dynamically mutual interaction between the coulomb and the symmetry potentials : along the time evolution at the compression stage , more neutrons are pushed out because the relative strength of the symmetry potential as compared to the coulomb potential increases .",

    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the coulomb potential is stronger than the symmetry potential , and the coulomb potential acts directly on the charged pions but the symmetry potential does not , such that the @xmath19 s emitted from the dense region , which have higher @xmath101 , may be influenced much more by their coulomb potential than by the symmetry potential . considering the limit of experiments so far , we claim that the @xmath5 production ratio at @xmath117 is a suitable candidate for probing the density dependence of the symmetry potential , which is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",

    "the percentages of each component of @xmath19 and of the total @xmath19 yield are shown as a function of the reduced density @xmath24 , in steps of @xmath118 , with the coulomb potential of mesons included .",
    "most pions are emitted from densities higher than normal nuclear density ( especially from the density region @xmath119 ) ; a few pions ( @xmath120 ) are emitted from subnormal densities .",
    "this follows from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where quite a few @xmath70 s are transported close to normal nuclear density . as these @xmath70 s decay ,",
    "some of them also appear at subnormal densities .    in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , the ratios of the percentages of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are shown as a function of the reduced density @xmath24 , with and without the coulomb potential of mesons .",
    "the ratios are always larger at lower densities than at higher densities since at the late stage , where the nuclear density decreases , the @xmath0 ratio ( shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) increases with time .",
    "when the coulomb potential of mesons is taken into account , more @xmath3 mesons are decelerated because of the larger amount of the negatively charged particles in the low density region , and are thus emitted with low momenta which leads to the rise of the @xmath5 ratios at low @xmath101 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig11 ] shows the time evolution of the @xmath21 and @xmath23 abundancies , as well as their ratios @xmath20 , for central @xmath28 collisions at beam energy @xmath30 gev and for the symmetry potentials f15 and fa3 .",
    "similar to the @xmath19 production , the effect of different density dependences of the symmetry potential on the kaon yields is quite reduced at higher energies .    in sis",
    "energy hics , kaons are emitted mainly from the high density region and at the early stage of the reaction .",
    "the dominant production channels are @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( here @xmath123 represents a hyperon ) . with a softer symmetry potential , in the neutron - rich nuclear medium , more neutrons ( protons )",
    "are shifted to the high ( low ) density region and hence more negatively ( less positively ) charged @xmath124 are produced , and the @xmath20 ratio increases .",
    "thinking of the energy dependence , the kaon production at energies much lower than its threshold ( @xmath125 gev from the nucleon - nucleon interaction in free space ) might be more sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry potential .",
    "as an example , we have also calculated the kaon yields from the reaction @xmath126 at @xmath127 gev and @xmath128 with the symmetry potentials f15 and fa3 : the @xmath20 ratio for f15 is about @xmath129 , whereas it is about @xmath130 for fa3 .",
    "we should point out that these results on kaons might be relatively rough since we do not consider any kaon - nucleon mean - field potential @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , there is no explicit calculation about the difference of @xmath23- and @xmath21-nucleon potentials in the nuclear medium .     and k@xmath7 abundancies for central @xmath28 collisions at a beam energy @xmath30 gev and with the symmetry potentials f15 and fa3 .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the role of the density - dependent symmetry potential in heavy ion collisions ( hics ) at sis energies , based on the urqmd model ( v1.3 ) .",
    "the contribution of the coulomb potential of mesons has been studied , in order to better understand the effects of the density - dependent symmetry potential on the dynamics of pions produced in neutron - rich hics .",
    "the calculated results show a strong beam - energy dependence of the effect of the density - dependent symmetry potentials on the production ratios @xmath0 as well as @xmath5 .",
    "the uncertainty in the isospin - independent eos alters the values of both the pion yields and the @xmath5 ratios , but has almost no effect on the role of the density - dependent symmetry potential on the @xmath5 ratios .",
    "the impact parameter is found to be important for the @xmath5 ratios ; for a larger impact parameter the effect of different density - dependent symmetry potentials on the @xmath5 ratios becomes stronger .",
    "the coulomb potential of mesons changes the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath5 ratios significantly , though it leaves the total @xmath3 and @xmath4 yields almost unchanged .",
    "we find that the negatively charged pion yields , especially at midrapidity and low transverse momenta , as well as the @xmath5 ratios at low transverse momenta , could be sensitive to the density - dependent symmetry potential in a dense nuclear matter .",
    "quite a few pions are still produced at subnormal densities and thus are affected by the density - dependent symmetry potential at subnormal densities .",
    "these studies are of interest for forthcoming experiments at ria ( usa ) and fair / gsi ( germany ) .    in this work ,",
    "we have also investigated the yields of k@xmath6 and k@xmath7 mesons and the ratios @xmath20 from neutron - rich hics at @xmath94 gev .",
    "it is shown that they do not seem to be suitable to investigate the density dependence of the symmetry potential in dense nuclear matter .",
    "however , kaon production at energies much lower than threshold might improve the situation and is worth investigating further .",
    "meanwhile , it is necessary to consider the difference of the @xmath23- and @xmath21-nucleon potentials in the nuclear medium .",
