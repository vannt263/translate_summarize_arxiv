    "this paper uses the @xmath3 system of units in which the basic nits are the quantum of electric charge , electron mass and the speed of light .    according to the theory of the big - bang , the history of the universe begins with an unimaginably great outburst of photons of very high energy around a point @xmath4 , after which time begins to elapse .",
    "the formation of heavy particles at once begins , and ends when the temperature of the universe has fallen to below the required level , and the radius of the universe has attained the dimension @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamics of the big - bang thus appears to be the result of the joint action of the kinetic energies of the particles which emerge at a velocity close to @xmath6 at a distance @xmath7 from @xmath4 , and the attraction of the mass of the universe @xmath8 , which is exerted from @xmath4 , the center of its mass , reasonably assuming a uniform expansion , causing matter to be distributed as spherical surfaces of radius @xmath9 .",
    "figure 1 shows a diametric section on which point @xmath10 indicates our observatory on earth , point @xmath11 represents the limit of the visibility from @xmath10 , so that the velocity of growth of @xmath12 is @xmath6 , and point @xmath4 is the centre of the universe , perhaps the starting point of the big - bang , perhaps the center of what was emerged from the big - bang .    the relation between the volume of the observable universe , @xmath13 , and that of the totality of the universe , @xmath14 , is given by the relation between the area of the sphere and the spherical segment @xmath15 . in other words : @xmath16 this relation holds for @xmath17 ; for @xmath18 , it would be @xmath19 .    just after the big - bang ,",
    "the radius of the universe was growing at speed @xmath6 .",
    "as the speed of the growth of @xmath9 decreased , the value of @xmath20 must have gone on increasing , so that the speed at which @xmath11 moves away from @xmath10 would continue to be @xmath6 .",
    "the information used in this paper comes mostly from the third edition of  universe \" , published in 2000 .",
    "this book contains ( fig .",
    "26 - 22 ) a sky map which is said to show approximately 10 % of the visible universe , and which has permitted an estimate to be made of the number of galaxies .",
    "roughly @xmath21 galaxies have thus been detected .",
    "we can therefore guess that the number of galaxies in the observable universe could be of the order of @xmath22 , though this is only a preliminary estimate .",
    "also these galaxies are distributed as follows :    * 77 % spiral galaxies ( s ) and ( sb ) of between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "* 20 % elliptical galaxies ( e ) of between @xmath25 and @xmath26 . *  3% irregular galaxies ( irr ) of between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "+ where @xmath29 is the mass of the sun ( _ universe _ , p. 646 ) .",
    "it is estimated that dispersed interstellar matter ( elementary particles , atoms , molecules and  dust \" ) is insignificant in elliptical galaxies and represents between 2.5% and 25% of the mass of stars and planets in the spiral and irregular galaxies .    keeping in mind the fact that the immense majority of elliptical galaxies are dwarfs and that the giant elliptical galaxies are rare ,",
    "an estimate has been made of the average mass of the group , assuming that the probability distribution of the logarithms of their masses follows a poisson distribution .",
    "this produces an average mass of @xmath30 ( any future more exact study would start from the statistical analysis of the available data not too awkward a task ) .    for galaxies ( s ) and ( irr ) a normal distribution has been assumed , with the result that for @xmath31 galaxies in question , we obtain this preliminary estimate : @xmath32    it may seen absurd to go as far as 7 significant figures in a preliminary approximation to the mass of spiral galaxies , this has been done in order to highlight the great preponderance of these galaxies within the present estimate .    to this sum , @xmath33",
    ", we must add the intergalactic  dark matter \" , scattered through the heart of the clouds of galaxies , and whose mass is thought to be of the same order of magnitude as that of the galaxies in the clouds ( _ universe _ , pg . 659 ) .",
    "that would mean that this figure should be doubled , giving the preliminary result : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass of the  visible universe \" , @xmath36 is the angle @xmath37 between the earth , @xmath4 ( origin of the big - bang ) and @xmath11 , which is the must distant observed object and shows a redshift @xmath38 ( _ universe _ , p. 597 ) ; @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the wavelength of a spectral line observed in a cosmic object , and @xmath41 is the wavelength of the corresponding line within the light emitted by an object at rest on earth .",
    "the equation @xmath42 allows us the infer that the said remotest cosmic object is moving away from us at @xmath43 .",
    "the fact that there exists a  limit of visibility \"  which is moving away at the speed of ligth shows that the universe is expanding .",
    "returning to fig . 1 , and remembering that the length of the arc @xmath12 is equal to @xmath44 ( @xmath36 expressed in radians ) , it is clear that the speed at which the length of that arc increases is @xmath45    table i shows as functions of certain values of @xmath36 , the values of the speed of increase of @xmath9 , @xmath46 ; the kinetic energy of an electron at rest at @xmath10 , viewed from a reference system at rest at @xmath4 and whose axis @xmath47 coincides with @xmath48 , and the relation @xmath49 between the mass of the universe and that of the observable universe as estimated above .    .values of @xmath50 ; @xmath51 and @xmath8 as functions of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath52 is the angle @xmath37 , in radians , where @xmath10 is the observatory , @xmath4 the point of origin of the  big - bang \" and @xmath11 is an object on the  horizon of visibility \" at @xmath53 light years from @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath46 is the velocity of increase of @xmath9 , radius of the universe .",
    "@xmath51 is the kinetic energy of a particle @xmath54 , moving with velocity @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath55 is the mass of the  observable universe \" , estimated as @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath8 is the mass of the universe , @xmath57 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however if ignoring ( 10 ) , we consider only the evolution of the kinetic energy given by ( 2 ) , and that of @xmath58 given by ( 5 ) we could draw a curve which crosses the axis @xmath59 at @xmath5 , being there tangent to @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath61 grows , @xmath62 disminishes down to zero at @xmath63 , and from here the particle returns towards @xmath4 ; when @xmath58 is negative , and reaches its theoretical maximum negative value at @xmath5 ,  @xmath64 ( which is positive being @xmath65 ) ,    we must say here that , if @xmath5 , @xmath66    figure 7 shows the hypothetical path of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath61 , when @xmath67    the point @xmath68 where @xmath69 is always a point in the curve ( 10 ) , because the value of @xmath70 is zero when @xmath5 . the other point where @xmath5 corresponds for @xmath64 and",
    "is also situated on curve ( 10 ) .",
    "no other values of @xmath61 give real values of @xmath9 when introduced into ( 10 ) , but we know that the maximum @xmath71 corresponds to @xmath72 which agrees with ( 3 ) and that @xmath73 for @xmath64 ,  @xmath5 .",
    "knowing these three points and the values of @xmath62 in each one of them we can easily draw the path of @xmath9 which can be seen on fig .",
    "the only problem is , that after reaching point @xmath74 our particle @xmath75 would go on towards @xmath4 at velocities greater than @xmath6 .",
    "but @xmath75 would be then subject to black hole conditions , and its behaviour might be different .",
    "the representation of ( 10 ) is that of @xmath9 as function of @xmath61 , when @xmath76 .",
    "it is not valid for @xmath77 ; only the points @xmath59 ,  @xmath5 ;  @xmath64 ,  @xmath5 ,  belong to the representation of ( 10 ) when @xmath77 . for any other value of @xmath61",
    ", the equation ( 10 ) gives imaginary values of @xmath9 .",
    "but the fact that we can calculate easily the coordinates and the values of @xmath62 for points @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) leads us to believe that there would be a real representation of @xmath9 as function of @xmath61 when @xmath77 , as shown in fig .",
    "7 . it would be convenient to know something about the possible implications of this , and it is possible to get some useful knowledge without knowing any equation relating @xmath9 to @xmath61 when @xmath77 .    the present value of @xmath80 , given by @xmath81 , can be seen in table iv to be more than 1000 times the radius of schwarzschild which corresponds to @xmath82 radian in table i , i.e. @xmath83 . moreover , this value is still increasing . on the other hand , it must be smaller than @xmath84 ; we are still seeing the very remote cosmic objects with a redshift and not with a blueshift .",
    "the number @xmath85 must be positive , to obtain real values for @xmath86 .",
    "we have @xmath87 ; and @xmath88 ; because if @xmath89 , we would be beyond point @xmath74 , and the furthest cosmic objects would show us a blueshift instead of a redshift .",
    "there is only one possibility left ; @xmath90 , being @xmath91 very small and @xmath92 .",
    "otherwise the values of @xmath0 would be greater than those of @xmath9 , leading to values of @xmath8 absurdly greater than those which have been calculated in table ii .",
    "for instance , if @xmath93 ,  @xmath8 must be greater than @xmath94 , which seems to make no sense .    if @xmath95 we could have values of @xmath96 which make @xmath97 allowing reasonable estimates for @xmath0 ,  @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "the range of variation of @xmath91 leads to a very short range of variation of @xmath98 .",
    "in effect @xmath99 is so short that it would mean that the birth of the universe was exactly determined and would exclude any hypothesis based on chance .",
