    ", we can indicate a metric by one function .",
    "therefore , the equations for particle motion in the colored black hole ansatz , despite having higher derivatives , can be easier than of them in the einstein - yang - mills theory . also describing the galactic rotation without dark matter is one of the most important properties of conformal gravity @xcite . also kerr",
    "ads nut like solution confirm by conformal gravity @xcite , that the analysis of rotating blackhole of this solution , were studied in ref .",
    "one of the method that we use to investigate gravitational fields of objects like black holes is study of the motion of test particles around them .",
    "the weierstrassian elliptic functions are useful to study analytic solution of motion . at first , hagihara in 1931 demonstrate the analytically solution for schwarzschild spacetime , in terms of elliptic functions @xcite .",
    "this method was also used for kerr de sitter space - time @xcite , schwarzschild de sitter in 4-dimensional @xcite , reissner - nordstrom and reissner - nordstrom -(anti ) de sitter spactime @xcite .",
    "recently , the geodesic equations were solved analytically , in some spacetime such as @xmath1 gravity , btz , gmghs black holes and a static cylindrically symmetric conformal spacetime @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we want to solve the geodesic equations of su(2)-colored ( a)ds black holes that was obtained in cg in ref .",
    "there are some different descriptions on applicability of geodesic solution in this theory .",
    "although , some investigations predicate that , only null geodesics are physically meaningful in conformal gravity @xcite .",
    "but , some discussions in conformal gravity , state that timelike geodesic , are applicable in conformal gravity , such as , free fall of bound packets of elementary particles or packets of gravitational energy of geons which is proposed by wheeler @xcite , also the possibility of choosing the gauge which makes attractive this theory for all geodesics which is studied by edery and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , here we derive the analytical solutions for the equation of motion in terms of weierstrass elliptic functions and derivatives of kleinian sigma functions in the spacetime of su(2)-colored ( a)ds black holes , and using effective potential and real zeros of polynomial , we study the region of test particle motion . our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
