    "microscopic models for certain viscoelastic fluids , such as wormlike micelles @xcite and high molecular weight polymeric liquids @xcite predict unstable homogeneous stationary states for controlled average shear rates . specifically , the coupled equations of motion for the fluid flow and microstructural quantities , such as the viscoelastic stress @xmath0 or orientational order , predict a nonmonotonic _ constitutive curve _ , _",
    "i.e. _ the steady state total shear stress @xmath1 ( or equivalently the applied torque ) as a function of applied shear rate @xmath2 for homogeneous flows .",
    "this constitutive curve typically is multivalued with a region of decreasing shear stress as a function of increasing shear rate , which is a hallmark of hydrodynamic instability @xcite . understanding this nonlinear behavior is important for practical applications such as injection moulding of plastics and drilling muds used in bore holes @xcite .",
    "the simplest resolution of the instability is an inhomogeneous state with macroscopic regions of high and low shear rates , known as shear bands @xcite , which has been widely observed in wormlike micelles @xcite , lamellar surfactant solutions @xcite , and liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "the resulting experimental signature of this inhomogeneous state is a stress plateau as a function of controlled average shear rate .",
    "we denote this experimentally determined relation between total shear stress and average shear rate as the _ flow curve _ ; in shear banding flow this curve incorporates inhomogeneous flows and is distinct from the constitutive curve , which can not be measured because of the constitutive instability . in fig .",
    "[ fig : djsneumann ] the dashed line shows the constitutive curve while the triangles show flow curves that could be measured upon either increasing or decreasing average shear rate ramps .",
    "experimentally , it is clear that the geometry of the shear cell affects the positioning of the shear bands .",
    "the simplest structure is seen in the cylindrical couette geometry where two bands form , with the higher shear rate band near the inner wall ( rotor ) @xcite . in the cone and plate geometry",
    "a different band configuration has been reported : two low shear rate regions next to the cone and plate separated by a high shear rate region @xcite .",
    "one explanation offered for that result was that secondary flows stabilized the center band @xcite .",
    "we will show that a boundary condition that prescribes a value for the polymeric stress tensor similar to that of the low shear rate phase can induce this three - band configuration .",
    "the experimental rheological features of shear banding have been studied in detail for wormlike micellar solutions @xcite . a constitutive curve such as the dashed line in fig .  [ fig : djsneumann ]",
    "can only be inferred because the negative slope region is unstable ; however , the experimentally measured flow curve , indicated by triangles , typically shows a stress plateau which spans the range of average applied shear rates at which the system shows shear banding . during shear rate ramps from rest , hysteresis is often observed at the start of this plateau : the stress increases past the plateau stress and follows the constitutive curve until , at a time that depends on the rate of the ramp , a high shear rate band develops and the total stress decreases onto the steady state plateau @xcite .",
    "however , if the shear rate is reduced from a point on the plateau , the low shear rate branch of the constitutive curve is intersected directly by the flat plateau .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of nucleation and hysteresis at first order phase transitions , and we will show below that the boundary conditions can influence this hysteresis , in a manner analogous to heterogeneous nucleation .    in modelling shear banding systems such as wormlike micelles the most important degrees of freedom are the fluid velocity @xmath3 and a viscoelastic contribution to the stress , @xmath0 ; here we neglect other other potentially important quantities such as concentration and micellar length . among models with non - monotonic constitutive curves for homogeneous flow ,",
    "spatially local ones such as the johnson - segalman model in its original form @xcite show high sensitivity to the flow history and do not give the well - defined and unique stress plateau observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if a non - local diffusive term ( typically proportional to @xmath4 ) is included in the constitutive equation for the viscoelastic stress ( _ e.g. _ the diffusive johnson - segalman ( djs ) model ) , there is only a single value of the total stress for which the interface between bands is stable and stationary @xcite .",
    "the diffusive term arises from microscopic physical mechanisms such as the diffusion of molecules that carry stress @xcite , the persistence length of wormlike micelles @xcite , or hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the resulting equation governing inhomogeneous steady states is thus a spatial differential equation for the viscoelastic stress , which necessitates a boundary condition that is , at present , unknown .",
    "the most frequently used boundary condition on the viscoelastic stress @xmath0 has been that of zero stress gradient parallel to the boundary normal @xcite . this boundary condition predicts the flow curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : djsneumann ] for the djs model .",
    "as noted above , this flow curve shows hysteretic behavior at the start of the stress plateau similar to that seen in experiment @xcite , with a stress overshoot during an increasing shear rate ramp .",
    "other theoretical studies of shear banding have used a fixed value of the polymeric stress @xcite at the wall ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) . cook and rossi considered a two - fluid model for wormlike micelles in which the micelles were assumed to align at the wall parallel to the flow direction , in both planar and cylindrical couette flow .",
    "they found that the flow curve deviates significantly from the constitutive curve near the low shear rate branch @xcite , exhibited hysteresis only at the high shear rate side of the stress plateau , and possessed a three - band state with the boundary condition induced high shear rate bands near the wall .",
    "qualitatively similar results were found by picard and co - workers in a scalar model for shear banding in a yield stress solid @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform a more detailed study of the effects of different boundary conditions for the viscoelastic stress at the wall , @xmath5 .",
    "we consider strong `` anchoring '' in which dirichlet conditions apply , and interpolate between oblate and prolate forms of @xmath5 .",
    "we also study mixed boundary conditions , in which @xmath5 is determined by a balance between spatial gradients and surface anchoring .",
    "moreover , we address the important interplay between the boundary conditions and intrinsic inhomogeneity of the flow determined by the flow geometry ( to compare cylindrical and planar couette flow with cone and plate flow , for example ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : equations - motion ] we outline the details for solving the equations of motion within the creeping flow approximation in cylindrical couette flow , and describe two constitutive equations for the viscoelastic stress : the djs model @xcite and a tube - based model which has been developed for polymer solutions and wormlike micelles @xcite .",
    "the physical motivation for the boundary conditions is discussed in section [ sec : bc ] . after reviewing previous results for neumann boundary conditions in section [ sec : neumann ] , the main new results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we organize these as follows : ( 1 ) the effect of different fixed value ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions on the flow curves and hysteresis upon increasing and then decreasing the average shear rate ; ( 2 ) the interplay between boundary conditions and the stress gradient imposed by the flow geometry ( _ e.g. _ cylindrical couette flow ) and their effects on the stable position of the shear bands ; and ( 3 ) the effect of mixed boundary conditions , in which the viscoelastic stress at the surface is influenced by both the bulk constitutive relation and the flow geometry .",
    "we demonstrate the possibility of a transition between different effective boundary conditions as a function of the anchoring strength .",
    "in a wormlike micellar system we assume that the total stress @xmath6 can be separated into contributions from the newtonian solvent and a viscoelastic stress @xmath0 from the micelles : @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes the identity matrix , @xmath9 is the solvent shear viscosity , @xmath10 $ ] is the symmetric velocity gradient tensor , and @xmath11 is the isotropic pressure determined by incompressibility ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "we assume no - slip boundary conditions on the velocity field . for cylindrical couette flow with a fixed outer cylinder and a rotating inner cylinder of velocity @xmath20 , the no - slip boundary conditions lead to the following global constraint @xmath21 which implies that the specific torque @xmath19 is given by @xmath22    to simplify the equations we define the spatial variable @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",

    "interestingly , for @xmath54 this model is identical to an extension of the original doi - edwards ( de ) theory of entangled polymers @xcite , which has a constitutive instability and therefore predicts shear banding .",
    "this extension to the de theory incorporates the enhanced release of polymer entanglements due to convection@xcite , which increases the polymer stress and can `` cure '' the de instability for sufficiently strong convected constraint release ( ccr ) .",
    "ccr and tube stretching were incorporated in @xcite to describe polymer melts and wormlike micelles , and later simplified to a differential version called the rolie - poly model @xcite . in the version of the rolie - poly model used in eq .",

    "a summary of the behavior of the djs and drp models for a range of boundary conditions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcsbjs ] .",
    "there are essentially three types of behaviors : hysteresis loops can be observed on ( 1 ) the high shear rate end of the stress plateau , ( 2 ) the low shear rate end of the stress plateau , or ( 3 ) both ends of the stress plateau .",
    "hysteresis vanishes on those flow branches whose viscoelastic stress , loosely , is similar to the imposed boundary value @xmath5 .",
    "the two models have broadly similar qualitative behavior .",
    "[ the apparently greater slope across the plateau for the drp model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maprp ] ) is due to the curvature of couette flow and the smaller vertical scale . ]",
    "the behavior was similar when the boundary conditions were altered by choosing a prolate @xmath5 and rotating its principal axis from the flow gradient ( homeotropic ) to the velocity ( tangential ) directions . for tangential boundary conditions ( resembling the high shear rate state ) there was no overshoot at the start of the plateau either on ramping the shear rate up or down .",
    "however on ramping down the shear rate the flow curve undershoots the stress plateau at the high shear rate end of the plateau . as the boundary condition is rotated the hysteresis at the high shear rate end vanishes , and starts to develop at the low shear rate end . for homeotropic alignment ( resembling the low shear rate state )",
    "the hysteresis completely vanishes at the high shear rate end of the plateau , and hysteresis develops at the low shear rate end .",
    "having determined that similarity of the imposed viscoelastic stress @xmath5 to that of either the high or low shear rate phases is crucial , we focus for the remainder of this paper on boundary conditions for which @xmath5 is one of these values . for the djs model with @xmath165 and",

    "this occurs for both the drp ( not shown ) and djs models .",
    "as noted above , this is because the interfacial layer occupies a progressively smaller fraction of the sample : the separation between the heterogeneous flow curve and homogeneous constitutive curve is proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "this behavior should be contrasted with the neumann case ( fig .  [ fig : hysteresisloops ] ) , in which the flow curve matches the constitutive curve for all @xmath170 .        for a flow cell with a stress gradient , such as a cylindrical couette cell ,",
    "the interface in simple banding flow with neumann boundary conditions lies at the position in the flow cell where the stress is equal to the selected total shear stress @xmath173 .",

    "we expect the high shear rate phase to preferentially occupy the high stress regions .",
    "this is indeed what we find .",
    "for increasing curvature the three band configuration becomes increasingly asymmetric , as seen in both the djs and drp models ( figs .",

    "a crossover from three banded to nearly two - banded behavior occurs at smaller @xmath106 values ( weaker curvature ) for smaller @xmath93 .",
    "the three band state is most pronounced when the boundaries induce the low shear rate phase @xmath5 .",
    "+    the behavior described above can be rationalized as follows . for a symmetric flat system ( @xmath141 )",
    "both interfaces lie at the selected stress , since the total stress is uniform .",
    "the very weak effect a slightly curved system @xmath175 breaks the symmetry of the shear banded structure , and only one ( or neither ) interface can lie at the selected stress ; at the same time , the stress gradient would favor locating the high shear band near the inner cylinder .",
    "these two tendencies adjust the band configuration such that high ( low ) shear rate bands grow ( shrink ) near the inner cylinder and shrink ( grow ) near the outer cylinder .",
    "for example , for boundary conditions that favor the low shear rate band the band near the inner cylinder should become narrower with increasing curvature ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : jsvq]a , c ) . however , a larger diffusion coefficient broadens the interfaces between bands , which means that the walls can strongly influence the bulk behavior .",
    "correspondingly , for large @xmath170 the position of the center shear band moves more smoothly as a function of the geometric curvature @xmath106 .",
    "for example , compare fig .",

    "thus , a three band structure , as observed by britton and callaghan @xcite , could be consistent with boundary conditions that favor the low shear rate form of the viscoelastic stress .",

    "the interface closest to the outer cylinder ( at larger @xmath144 ) remains at the selected stress @xmath173 while the inner interface is at a higher stress , as can be seen by the intersections of the shear rate profiles as a function of total stress in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpvals](iii , iv ) . upon approaching the flat limit",
    "both interfaces approach the selected stress .",
    "the degree of anchoring strength above which the boundary conditions become dirichlet - like depends weakly on the geometric curvature . for a more highly curved geometry a larger anchoring potential ( smaller @xmath75 )",
    "is required to enforce the boundary condition @xmath184 .",
    "this is because the higher stress at the inner wall competes with the tendency of the wall to induce the low shear rate band .",
    "we have examined whether or not this `` surface transition '' between different anchoring states has an appreciable mechanical signal .",

    "the degree of anchoring is only weakly affected by the overall average shear rate ; only when one interface approaches the wall is there an effect , and again this is reflected in only a small change in the measured total stress .",
    "similar behavior is found for @xmath187 , with a few differences . in this case the interface closest to the inner wall lies at the selected stress , as can be seen in the profiles for @xmath188 in fig .  [",
    "fig : mixedall ] ; this implies that for both @xmath184 and @xmath187 the interface that separates an inner band at high shear rate from an outer band at low shear rate lies at the selected stress .",
    "another difference is that the geometric curvature @xmath106 has a very weak effect on the effective boundary condition , because the higher stress at the inner wall does nt compete with the boundary condition .",
    "we have performed a numerical study of the effect of the boundary conditions on the viscoelastic ( polymer ) stress for the diffusive johnson - segalman ( djs ) and diffusive non - stretching rolie - poly ( drp ) models , in cylindrical couette flow .",
    "the main results are the following :    1 .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions ( fixed @xmath5 ) influence the possible hysteretic behavior for the flow curve : for @xmath5 resembling the high shear rate phase a hysteresis loop occurs at the high shear rate end of the stress plateau , while for @xmath5 resembling the low shear rate phase a hysteresis loop occurs at the low shear rate end of the stress plateau .",
    "2 .   the walls can induce a lubrication ( or thickened ) layer that suppresses the hysteresis that would occur upon sweeping the shear rate into a banded state from a flow branch with characteristic dissimilar to the boundary layer .",
    "3 .   as with neumann boundary conditions , the hysteresis loop shrinks with decreasing diffusion constant .",
    "4 .   for dirichlet",
    "boundary conditions the stress distribution in the gap depends on both the boundary condition and the stress gradient .",
    "a three - band state is stable for weak curvature such as cone and plate flow , which becomes more asymmetric or even two - banded as the stress gradient increases to that of typical cylindrical couette flow .",
    "5 .   for mixed boundary conditions",
    "the strength of wall anchoring determines whether the effective boundary conditions are neumann or dirichlet .",
    "the crossover occurs when the extrapolation @xmath75 length is of order the interfacial width @xmath44 , or @xmath189 .",
    "this is the first use of the drp model to study shear banding .",
    "the model is microscopically motivated by either polymer solutions or wormlike micelles , and its non - monotonic behavior arises from better - understood physics ( convected constraint release competing with tube alignment ) than that in the djs model ( where the `` slip parameter '' @xmath40 is necessary ) .",
    "the physics of convected constraint release yields a less well aligned state in the high shear rate phase , whose alignment angle , compared to that from the djs model , is closer to that seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "numerically , interfaces typically travel faster in the drp model than in the djs model , and hence can be more quickly and reliably calculated , and the drp model is more robust to large time steps and inhomogeneous initial conditions .",
    "an important open problem is the relation of wall slip to shear banding flows .",
    "a boundary condition such as @xmath190 , which imposes alignment parallel to the flow direction @xmath3 , yields velocity profiles that could be interpreted in terms of wall slip , because of the lack of a shear component of the viscoelastic stress at the wall .",
    "the banding profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : hdistsbjs ] , for example , have small regions of very high shear rate near either wall .",
    "et al . _ measured a correlation between band motion and wall slip in a solution of ctab wormlike micelles @xcite .",
    "they used smooth and sand - blasted couette cells and found different velocity profiles and interface dynamics in the banding regime .",
    "it is possible that these differences are a combination of both different intrinsic boundary conditions and different degrees of wall slip .",
    "another signature of this effect would lie in the measurement of the low shear rate branch before shear banding occurs : the flow cell ( for example , the smooth one ) that induced tangential ordering would have a smaller stress at a given shear rate , due to the associated lubrication layer , than would the flow cell ( _ e.g. _ the sand - blasted one ) with less preference for the high shear rate branch .    in related work ,",
    "manneville and co - workers @xcite measured the rheology and velocity profiles in a triblock copolymer solution that forms wormlike micelles , using heterodyne light scattering . at @xmath191 the solutions did not shear band but did exhibit wall slip , within the @xmath192 resolution of the technique . at a higher temperature @xmath193 , believed to correspond to longer micelles , the solution exhibited a three - band shear banding scenario with the high shear rate bands near the inner wall .",
    "these data are consistent with the walls inducing preferential ordering parallel to the walls with increasing temperature and longer micelles , so that that wall slip could be either `` true '' slip or an apparent slip due to the specific nature of the boundary conditions",
    ". other mechanisms for slip , such as micelles detaching from the wall and disentangling near the surface , may also be relevant in this case @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "mixed boundary conditions allows for multiple stable inhomogeneous solutions , which could be susceptible to non - linear perturbations such as local flow inhomogeneities , thermal fluctuations , asperities , motor noise , _",
    "etc_. the solutions found here switched between effective neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions as a function of anchoring strength , but easily externally controllable quantities such as flow geometry and imposed average shear rate had very weak effects , and the total stress differences between the two kinds of anchoring was small ( typically less than a percent ) .",
    "one could , in principle , envision more complex surface anchoring behavior , such as a multi - welled wall potential that would govern a surface phase transition between two different wall orientations @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the order parameter in the bulk could then , in principle , drive the boundary condition between the two potential wells , which would then have more dramatic consequences .",
    "such a bulk - driven wall transition could also be triggered by fluctuations , would then lead to erratic band motion coupled to an apparent wall slip , depending on the details of the specific measurements .",
    "another physical effect that has not been considered here is the concentration degree of freedom , which in some cases probably leads to a depletion layer ( or in rarer cases perhaps coagulation ) layer near the surface .",

    "<S> we study shear banding flows in models of wormlike micelles or polymer solutions , and explore the effects of different boundary conditions for the viscoelastic stress . </S>",
    "<S> these are needed because the equations of motion are inherently non - local and include `` diffusive '' or square - gradient terms . using the diffusive johnson - segalman model and a variant of the rolie - poly model for entangled micelles or polymer solutions </S>",
    "<S> , we study the interplay between different boundary conditions and the intrinsic stress gradient imposed by the flow geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we consider prescribed gradient ( neumann ) or value ( dirichlet ) of the viscoelastic stress tensor at the boundary , as well as mixed boundary conditions in which an anchoring strength competes with the gradient contribution to the stress dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that hysteresis during shear rate sweeps is suppressed if the boundary conditions favor the state that is induced by the sweep . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the boundaries favor the high shear rate phase then hysteresis is suppressed at the low shear rate edges of the stress plateau . </S>",
    "<S> if the boundaries favor the low shear rate state , then the high shear rate band can lie in the center of the flow cell , leading to a three - band configuration . </S>",
    "<S> sufficiently strong stress gradients due to curved flow geometries , such as that of cylindrical couette flow , can convert this to a two - band state by forcing the high shear rate phase against the wall of higher stress , and can suppress the hysteresis loop observed during a shear rate sweep . </S>"
