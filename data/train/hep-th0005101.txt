    "an explicit relation between the noncommutative fields and the commutative ones has been presented in @xcite , called `` the seiberg - witten ( sw ) map . ''",
    "the noncommutative dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) theory and the ordinary one appear as low - energy effective theories of d - brane in a constant nsns @xmath3-field .",
    "they differ by the choice of the regularization for the worldsheet theory ; the pauli - villars regularization for the commutative description and the point - splitting regularization for the noncommutative one .",
    "this means that these two descriptions are connected by some field redefinition and this is the sw map .",
    "the relation between the commutative and noncommutative dbi theories has been examined in various aspects .",
    "now in particular , let us concentrate on the bps solutions and compare them in both the descriptions .",
    "the reason is that the bps solutions are considered as powerful tools beyond the perturbative understanding .",
    "noncommutative bps monopoles describe , by the brane interpretation of @xcite , the configurations of tilted d - strings ending on parallel d3-branes in a constant nsns @xmath3-field @xcite and have been investigated in various papers @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "noncommutative @xmath0 monopole was considered at the first order in the noncommutativity parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis using the noncommutative eigenvalue equation for the scalar field successfully reproduced the tilted d - string picture . in @xcite ,",
    "the similar analysis was carried out for the string junction and the anticipated result was obtained .",
    "study of the noncommutative monopoles using the sw map was carried out in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . there , the noncommutative bps solutions were transformed into the commutative description via the sw map , and then the brane interpretation was done for the eigenvalues of the mapped scalar field to give the expected tilted d - string picture .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the analysis of the noncommutative @xmath0 monopole using the sw map to second order in @xmath4 .",
    "the motivating fact is as follows : the sw map possesses some ambiguities in higher orders in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this map is derived from the requirement of the gauge equivalence of the two descriptions .",
    "since this is a very weak requirement , arbitrary parameters appear in the map .",
    "there are two types of ambiguities in it .",
    "one is in the form of the gauge transformation and has no physical effect .",
    "however , the other type of ambiguity consists of gauge covariant quantities and can cause physical differences .",
    "we apply the sw map to the noncommutative monopole solution at the second order in @xmath4 and examine the effects of the ambiguities . concretely , we compare the eigenvalues of the scalar field obtained by the sw map with that in the commutative yang - mills theory in a background magnetic field .",
    "note that the ambiguities in the sw map can change the scalar eigenvalues ( which are gauge invariant quantities ) and hence change their brane interpretation .",
    "it is found that we can make these two eigenvalues coincide with each other by tuning the free parameters in the sw map .",
    "this gives an example of how the ambiguities in the sw map are fixed in concrete physical situations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we solve the noncommutative version of the bps equation to second order in @xmath4 .",
    "in section 3 , we apply the sw map to the solution and evaluate the eigenvalues of the scalar field in the commutative description . in section 4 , we compare the scalar eigenvalues of section 3 with those in the commutative yang - mills theory in a constant magnetic field , and examine the effect of the ambiguities in the sw map . in section 4 ,",

    "we solved the noncommutative version of the bps equation to @xmath2 , mapped the solution to the commutative side , and obtained the eigenvalues of the resulting scalar field .",
    "we saw that the ambiguities in the sw map have explicit influence on the scalar eigenvalues .",
    "we made the brane interpretation to the scalar eigenvalues and examined whether they can reproduce the configuration of a tilted d - string suspended between two parallel d3-branes . in the asymptotic region ,",
    "the effect of the ambiguities in the sw map disappear and at the same time the scalar eigenvalue precisely give the expected d - string picture . without the restriction to the asymptotic region , we found that we can tune the free parameters in the sw map so that the scalar eigenvalues reproduce the desired configuration .",
    "it is necessary to introduce the covariant - type ambiguity term using the metric .",
    "the number of free parameters @xmath175 in the eigenvalues is just enough to adjust them to the expected ones .",
    "we would like to make a few comments .",
    "our first comment is on the covariant type ambiguity in the sw map . in this paper",
    "we have constructed the sw map first in the pure yang - mills system without the scalar field and then obtained the map for the scalar by the dimensional reduction of the map for the gauge field .",
    "this is natural if we recall the origin of the present super yang - mills theory via the dimensional reduction .",
    "however , if we forget this origin , there are other covariant - type ambiguities treating the scalar field @xmath73 as a gauge covariant quantity from the start . for example , as an ambiguity for the scalar field at @xmath28 , we have @xmath176",
    ". however , this term gives the same contribution ( with an arbitrary coefficient ) to the @xmath28 eigenvalue as the existing one ( [ l1 ] ) , and hence even the tilt angle at @xmath28 becomes a free parameter .",
    "next we shall comment on the noncommutative eigenvalue equation for the scalar field proposed and examined in @xcite . at @xmath28 ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the noncommutative eigenvalue problem for the scalar gave the same asymptotic behavior as those obtained via the sw map @xcite .",
    "we have carried out the analysis of the noncommutative eigenvalue equation for the classical solution at @xmath2 given in section 2",
    ". however , the resulting eigenvalues do not agree with those from the sw map even in the asymptotic region . therefore , the noncommutative eigenvalue equation seems to work well only at the first order in @xmath4 , though it is still an interesting subject to understand why it gives a good result at this order .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize the usefulness of the analysis using the bps solutions .",
    "the bps solutions are expected to remain intact even if we include the @xmath177 corrections .",
    "thus , the bps solutions would be helpful for giving a support for the equivalence between the noncommutative description and the commutative one independently of the @xmath177 expansion .",
    "it is a very interesting subject to pursue the method which enables us to examine this equivalence to all orders in @xmath4 .",
    "we would like to thank t.  asakawa , k.  hashimoto , i.  kishimoto and s.  moriyama for valuable discussions and useful comments .",
    "this work is supported in part by grant - in - aid for scientific research from ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan ( # 03602 and # 12640264 ) .",
    "the work of s.  g.  is supported in part by the japan society for the promotion of science under the predoctoral research program .",
    "in this appendix , we present the sw map for the gauge field to second order in the change @xmath70 of the noncommutativity parameter @xmath4 . the sw map is derived from the gauge equivalence relation @xcite @xmath178 where the quantities with a hat are defined at @xmath4 and those without hat at @xmath179 , a nearby point of @xmath4 .",
    "this unconventional meaning of hat is for the convenience of the use in section 3 .",
    "we expand @xmath90 and @xmath180 in powers of @xmath70 : @xmath181 substituting them into ( [ gauge equiv ] ) , the first order part is solved in the most general form as @xcite @xmath182 , \\\\",
