    "the detailed investigation of the properties of quantum degenerate gases of ultracold species ( _ i.e. _ with kinetic energy @xmath4 equivalent to a temperature @xmath5  millikelvin ) is among the most important goals of modern atomic , molecular , optical and statistical physics .",
    "a unique feature of ultracold quantum gases is the tunability of the interaction strength between the particles with the external fields : by employing the feshbach resonances @xcite it is possible to change the scattering length in broad range of values . by comparison with atoms , the rich internal structure of polar molecules",
    "( i.e. possessing a permanent electric dipole moment ) and their mutual strong anisotropic interactions can offer to this field novel opportunities for precision measurements and for quantum control using electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "ultracold molecules trapped in periodic optical lattices have been proposed as qubits for prototypes of quantum computers @xcite , or as quantum simulators for studies of many - body phenomena such as phase transitions , strongly correlated systems or many - body physics in reduced dimensions @xcite . in 2008",
    "two groups have reported the formation of ultracold gases of polar lics and krb molecules in ultracold temperatures @xcite : ultracold lics molecules have been obtained by photoassociation of pairs of ultracold li and cs atoms and spontaneous decay of excited lics@xmath6 molecule down to the electronic ground state , while ultracold krb molecules have been created through magnetoassociation of ultracold k and rb atoms into weakly bound levels of the molecular ground state , followed by stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) toward the lowest rovibrational level @xcite .",
    "there is also a number of other experiments aiming at creating ultracold heteronuclear diatomic alkali - metal molecules in their ground state like rbcs @xcite and nak @xcite , since in contrast with krb @xcite they are stable with respect to the chemical reactions of atom exchange and trimer formation @xcite .",
    "heteronuclear diatomic alkali - metal molecules in their ground state @xmath7 , however , are not easy to manipulate with external fields : their very weak magnetic moment originates only from nuclear spin , and they do not exhibit a linear stark effect in the rovibrational ground state . a very interesting class of quantum simulators has been proposed by micheli _",
    "_ @xcite employing molecules with both an electric and magnetic permanent dipole moment in their own frame .",
    "such molecules reveal fascinating potential for high - precision measurements ( for example the ybf molecule is being used in the determination of bounds for the electric dipole moment of the electron @xcite ) or for sensitive imaging of low - frequency electromagnetic fields @xcite . in the rest of the paper we will qualify in short such species as paramagnetic and polar molecules .",
    "one of the possible candidates for paramagnetic and polar molecules are diatomic molecules formed by association of laser - coolable atoms with different atomic spin quantum numbers , such as pairs of alkali - metal atoms and alkaline - earths atoms @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising candidates for such system is the rbsr molecule . besides its magnetic doublet @xmath8 electronic ground state",
    ", it exhibits a permanent electric dipole moment of about 1.4 - 1.5  debye @xcite .",
    "the laser cooling , trapping and manipulation of rb atoms have been well - established at the very beginning of the ultracold matter studies @xcite . at present",
    "the strontium atom is one of the most popular atomic species in ultracold physics @xcite : for example , the studies of bose - einstein condensation of sr atoms and bose - fermi mixtures ( of different sr isotopes ) has recently been reported @xcite . moreover",
    ", the innsbruck group has developed the stirap scheme to produce weakly bound sr@xmath9 molecules in ground electronic state .",
    "it is finally worth mentioning that sr@xmath9 molecules have also been produced by spontaneous decay from excited sr(@xmath10)sr(@xmath11 ) molecular state @xcite .",
    "more recently a quantum degenerate gas of rubidium atoms coexisting with strontium has been produced @xcite .",
    "another motivation which makes the studies of rbsr system particularly interesting is the magnetic tunability of scattering length due to presence of subtle mechanisms which can produce the feshbach resonances @xcite . that might allow the experimentalist to modify the scattering length in the ultracold mixture of rb and sr and control the behaviour of quantum gas of such atoms .",
    "it is worth mentioning that several other similar species are subject to intense ongoing research , like ybli @xcite and ybrb @xcite .",
    "manipulation of the quantum states of diatomic molecules with laser light requires the knowledge of appropriate transition energies , and thus of the potential energy curves ( pecs ) supporting the relevant energy levels and the corresponding transition dipole moments ( tdms ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , still only little is known about the structure of molecules containing alkali - metal atoms with group ii atoms .",
    "the electronic structure of ba neutral compounds ( bali , bana , bak ) has been explored some time ago by allouche and coworkers @xcite .",
    "other studies concern cali @xcite , libe @xcite .",
    "more recently the electronic structure of the related molecular ions containing one alkali atom and ca@xmath12 @xcite , sr@xmath12 @xcite or ba@xmath12 @xcite with various high - level approaches have been published in relation with experiments aiming at creating cold molecular ions in merged cold ion and cold atom traps .    in this paper",
    "we present the studies of interactions of rb and sr atoms in ground and excited states .",
    "we have recently examined this system in its @xmath8 ground state with two entirely different approaches @xcite : one relies on the representation of rbsr as a three - valence - electron molecule in the field of relativistic polarizable large effective core potentials ( ecps ) through a full configuration interaction ( fci ) calculation , while the other treats explicitly 19 electrons in the field of a relativistic small core ecp via the coupled cluster ( cc ) theory . here",
    ", we use these approaches to revisit and to extend the study of the electronic structure of the rbsr system .",
    "the methods are described in section [ methodssec ] .",
    "the ground state properties of rbsr are carefully revisited in section [ sec : ground ] including the potential curve , the permanent dipole moment , and the static dipole polarizability .",
    "we have calculated the pecs and the transition dipole moments between the @xmath8 ( rb(@xmath13)+sr(@xmath14 ) ) ground state and the excited @xmath15 and @xmath16 states correlated to the two lowest asymptotes rb(@xmath17)+sr(@xmath14 ) and rb(@xmath13)+sr(@xmath18 ) relevant for the ongoing experiments ( section [ sec : excited ] ) .",
    "we have also investigated the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling of these states within the framework of an atomic model involving experimental atomic so splittings .",
    "the results of this paper are of key importance in experimental investigations of the spectroscopy and dynamics of the rbsr diatom .",
    "these data could be adjusted to spectroscopic data in order to provide the essential information for designing optical routes for the formation of ultracold ground - state rbsr molecules in their lowest internal level , thus opening the way toward a degenerate quantum gas of molecules with both magnetic and electric dipole moments . in the rest of the paper , atomic units for distances ( 1  a.u .",
    "= @xmath19=0.0529177  nm ) , energies ( 1  a.u.=@xmath20=219474.63137  @xmath21 ) , and dipole moment ( 1  a.u.=2.541 580 59 debye ) will be used , except otherwise stated .",
    "the first method is identical to the one used in our previous works for rbsr@xmath12 @xcite and for the rbsr ground state @xcite .",
    "it is based on the representation of the rb@xmath12 and sr@xmath22 ionic cores by relativistic effective core potential ( ecp ) complemented with core polarization potential ( cpp ) simulating core - valence correlation along the lines developed by mller and meyer @xcite and foucrault _ et al . _",
    "@xcite.these effective potentials involve semi - empirical parameters ( reported in ref.@xcite ) which are chosen to reproduce the energies of the lowest @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 levels of the rb and sr@xmath12 one - valence - electron systems .",
    "a full configuration interaction method ( fci ) involving three valence electrons is performed in the framework of the cipsi method ( configuration interaction by perturbation of a multiconfiguration wave function selected iteratively ) developed at paul sabatier university in toulouse ( france ) . from now on we will refer to this method as fci / ecp+cpp .",
    "previous works on alkali dimers ( see for instance refs.@xcite ) have demonstrated that this approach yields results for equilibrium distances ( @xmath26 ) and potential well depths ( @xmath27 ) for ground and excited states in good agreement with those obtained from experiments : for example , the discrepancy on @xmath27 for the @xmath28 ground states of alkali dimers is typically much less than 100@xmath21 , often ( eg . for krb ) less than 20 @xmath21 .",
    "values for permanent electric dipole moments ( pedms ) of their @xmath28 ground state @xcite match those measured in recent ultracold molecule experiments ( _ e.g. _ for krb @xcite , lics @xcite ) .",
    "the tdms functions are also found in close agreement with other theoretical values @xcite .",
    "the ( well - known ) main advantage of the fci / ecp+cpp method is its versatility and robustness : several low - lying excited states can be easily calculated regardless their total spin , in contrast to single - reference quantum chemistry methods we employ in this paper ( see below ) . among disadvantages",
    "is its rapid increase of computational cost with increased basis set size . just as in ref.@xcite",
    "the basis set used in these calculations was limited to @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 gaussian - type basis functions which translates into a number of configurations of about @xmath29 . in the present case",
    ", the lack of @xmath30 orbitals mostly affects the evaluation of the dispersion interaction _",
    "i.e. _ its dependency in @xmath31 is well reproduced , but its magnitude may not be correct .",
    "the basis - set superposition error ( bsse ) has not been introduced , as we have checked that it remains small ( less than 1  @xmath21 ) for the three valence electrons , while it is hard to estimate for the core electrons which are not explicitly taken in account .",
    "the second method involves the calculations with fully relativistic small - core ecp ( ecp28mdf ) obtained by lim _",

    "implemented in the molpro 2012 package @xcite . in comparison to this work , we performed the calculations with significantly improved basis set in order to estimate the error attributed to the basis set incompleteness .",
    "we used the original uncontracted basis sets of lim _ et al .",

    "we also added a series of diffuse @xmath38 basis functions to better describe the dispersion interaction .",
    "we have further added @xmath39 bonding functions .",
    "we denote this new basis set with its maximum angular momentum @xmath40 .",
    "we have further extended this set to build a new one ( denoted with @xmath41 ) including one more large - exponent @xmath37 function for core - valence correlation and one diffuse @xmath42 function .",
    "the latter has been used only for ground state calculations .",
    "both basis sets are attached to this paper in the supplementary material .",
    "the doublet excited states have been obtained with the spin - restricted version of the open - shell equation - of - motion coupled cluster method limited to singly- and doubly- excited configurations(eom - ccsd ) @xcite implemented in the cfour package @xcite .",
    "this approach allows for calculating excitation energies from the electronic ground state to the excited state of any spatial symmetry , but it is unable to calculate the spin - flip transitions ( and thus those involving the quartet states ) .",
    "the excitation energies of doublet states obtained with eom - ccsd method has been then added to the ground state potential energy curve , while the lowest @xmath43 and @xmath44 pecs have been shifted in order to smoothly match the rb(@xmath13)+sr(@xmath18 ) asymptotes calculated with eom - ccsd .",
    "the basis functions has been restricted to the @xmath40 set with removed bonding functions .",
    "we present the results of our electronic - structure calculations for the ground state rbsr dimer using the rccsd(t ) method with both basis sets above in order to investigate the discrepancies between spectroscopic parameters obtained by gurout _",
    "_ @xcite and uchowski _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and to estimate the error bars due to the basis set truncation in cc calculations .",
    "results are shown in figure [ groundst ] , while the essential spectroscopic parameters are gathered in table [ gs_compare ] .",
    "the ground state potential calculated with the fci / ecp+cpp method @xcite is @xmath45  @xmath21 deep with an equilibrium distance @xmath46 while in ref .",
    "the depth of rbsr potential was found equal to 1000  @xmath21 at @xmath47 . with the new basis sets we have found that @xmath27 is approximately 3 - 4% larger : the rccsd(t ) value is increased to @xmath48  @xmath21 with the @xmath40 basis set and to @xmath49  @xmath21 with the @xmath41 one .",
    "the difference in @xmath27 in these basis sets is most likely related to a saturation of the dispersion energy in the calculations involving gaussian functions . based on well - know",
    "behavior of the correlation energy as a function of maximum angular momentum in the basis set @xcite we can deduce the complete basis limit expected for rccsd(t ) method yielding a total interaction energy 1047.9  @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , it is reasonable to treat the difference between extrapolated result and the interaction energy calculated using the @xmath41 basis set as the uncertainty of the calculation .",
    "it is still quite hard to estimate the error beyond the rccsd(t ) calculation and to this end we will compare how analogous methodology performs for the sr@xmath9 and singlet rb@xmath9 molecules .",
    "et al . _ have shown @xcite , that the ccsd(t ) dissociation energy of the sr@xmath9 dimer ( 1124  @xmath21 ) , calculated with the same core potential and similar basis set , is slightly larger ( by 3.8% ) than the experimental dissociation energy ( 1082 @xmath21 ) .",
    "the well depth of the rb@xmath9 ground state ccsd(t ) pec obtained with the ecp and basis set used in present study underestimates the experimental value ( 3836@xmath21 ) by 6% .",
    "thus , taking a 5% uncertainty ( 52 @xmath21 ) on our basis set potential is certainly a conservative estimate . for completeness",
    ", we have also calculated the rbsr ground state pec with spin - unrestricted coupled - cluster ( ucc ) approach : the potential depth for uccsd(t ) is no more than 20  @xmath21 larger than in the restricted case , which is within the estimated error bound .",
    "the result from the fci / ecp+cpp calculation falls within such error bound , as the well depth is only 33  @xmath21 deeper than the rccsd(t ) value .",
    "the agreement between harmonic constants @xmath50 is also very good : 38.98 @xmath21 with the fci / ecp+cpp approach and 38.09  @xmath21 with the rccsd(t ) calculations and the @xmath41 basis set .",
    "note , however , that @xmath26 is smaller by about 0.1  @xmath19 in the fci / ecp+cpp approach than in the rccsd(t ) .",
    "this is probably due to the short - range repulsion between the rb@xmath12 and the sr@xmath22 cores which is not automatically included the fci / ecp+cpp approach invloving large cores .",
    "this contribution can be represented by an exponential expression @xcite fitted on the hartree - fock energy of the rbsr@xmath51 system .",
    "    in fact both curves differ by merely one bound state and further two - color photoassociation spectroscopy for several isotopic mixtures of rbsr should provide the exact number of bound states supported by rbsr potential .",
    "the potential energy curves reported in this paper should be an excellent starting point for refinement using the experimental data .    .",

    "the pedms are almost identical ( 1.54  d ) , and they become slightly different only at short internuclear distances .",

    "we have obtained the @xmath98 values for the excited states by fitting the calculated potential energy curves at long range to @xmath99 analytic form .",
    "this procedure has to be performed very carefully : backing out the van der waals coefficients from the potential curves needs very high precision potential curves for broad range of distances . as invoked in section [ methodssec ] due to the lack of high angular momentum functions in the basis set used in the fci / ecp+cpp computations , we performed such fittings only for the cc methods . for the doublet states correlated to the rb(@xmath100)+sr(@xmath1 )",
    "limit we obtained @xmath101 and @xmath102 compared to the values of ref.@xcite , 17530 @xmath103 and 8331@xmath103 , respectively .",
    "despite the nice agreement obtained for the latter value , error bars for these values can be large and unpredictable as these values were obtained by fitting to the shape of eom - ccsd potential curve added to the ground state interaction energy of rbsr .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath98 values for the excited states correlating with rb(@xmath13)+sr(@xmath18 ) can be extracted with much better accuracy , since for the quartet states potential energy curves are obtained in direct way and not as a sum of interaction energy + eom - cc excitation .",
    "we obtained @xmath104 and @xmath105 which are in satisfactory agreement with the values 5735@xmath103 and 5000@xmath103 of ref.@xcite .",
    "spin - orbit ( so ) splittings are quite large for the lowest excited states of both atoms : 237.6  @xmath21 for rb(@xmath100 ) and 581.1  @xmath21 for sr(@xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore they must be taken in account in any accurate representation of the rbsr excited states for the purpose of modelling experimental results .",
    "it is well - known that due to configuration mixing the so couplings vary with the internuclear distance and can be reduced or enhanced typically by 30 - 50% compared to the atomic values .",
    "examples can be found for instance in spectroscopic studies of rbcs @xcite , kcs @xcite , or in quantum chemistry studies of sr@xmath9 @xcite , sryb @xcite or rb@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the goal of this paper to compute the @xmath52-dependence of the so coupling in rbsr .",
    "instead we present an approximate model where the atomic so is used as a perturbation to the hund s case ( a ) states , in order to deliver a preliminary picture of the relevant pecs . due to the large energy separation of the rb(@xmath100)+sr(@xmath106 ) and",
    "rb(@xmath2)+sr(@xmath3 ) asymptotes , the corresponding manifold of pecs can safely be considered as isolated from each other .",
    "we will also ignore the higher excited states discussed above which are submerged below the rb(@xmath2)+sr(@xmath3 ) asymptote .",
    "we follow the usual spectroscopic convention and use symbols @xmath107 , @xmath70 for the projection onto the molecular axis of the electronic quantities namely the orbital angular momentum and the spin , respectively , and @xmath108 .",
    "the atomic so constants are @xmath109  @xmath21 and @xmath110  @xmath21 .",
    "we use the fact that the matrix elements of spin - orbit hamiltonian @xmath111 in the basis @xmath112 can be expressed in the _ asymptotic _ basis set of atomic angular momenta using clebsch - gordon coefficients :    @xmath113    which more specifically reduces for doublet states to @xmath114 while for the quartet states it reads @xmath115    the interaction of rubidium atom in the @xmath116 state with sr ground state atom splits the degeneracy of the @xmath60 state into @xmath117 and @xmath95 state .",
    "the total angular momentum projection @xmath118 can then take the values @xmath119 and @xmath120 . a unique state @xmath121 originates from @xmath122 state , while two states with @xmath123 states originate from mixing of the @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath121 state is trivially reduced to one element only , which can be written as @xmath126 and asymptotically corresponds to @xmath127 state of the rb atom . for the @xmath123 state",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath128 two eigenvalues of this matrix asymptotically correspond to both @xmath129 , @xmath120 , state of excited rb(@xmath130 ) atom .",
    "for the interaction of @xmath131 state of sr and @xmath132 of rb the situation is somewhat more complicated . as we have mentioned in previous sections ,",
    "the resulting dimer states for the rb(@xmath2)sr(@xmath3 ) interaction in the hund s case ( a ) are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the possible quantum numbers for spin - orbit coupled states for that case are @xmath123 , @xmath120 and @xmath133 .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath118 corresponds trivially to single state , namely @xmath134 asymptotically corresponding to the metastable state of sr atom @xmath135 .",
    "the @xmath121 states can be obtained by coupling of three states : @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian from which we can obtain the hund  ( c ) case representation reads :    @xmath139    two of these states asymptotically correspond to the @xmath135 sr state , and one to the @xmath140 sr state .",
    "finally , for the @xmath123 we have five states involved : @xmath125 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the coupled @xmath123 states has the following form :    @xmath145    the eigenstates of the hamiltonian for @xmath146 correspond to all components of the @xmath62 asymptote of the excited sr atom : the lowest eigenvalue represents the interaction of rb atom with @xmath147 state of sr , two states correspond to the interaction with @xmath11 , and two with @xmath148 .",
    "[ hundc_vs_hunda ]    the resulting spin - orbit coupled pecs are shown in figure [ hundc_vs_hunda ] .",
    "the eom - cc and fci / ecp+cpp approaches give a very consistent potential energy curves , except some of the states which correlate with the rb(@xmath13)+sr(@xmath149 ) asymptote , which originate from doublet @xmath76 and @xmath77 states which are about 20% deeper in case of the fci / ecp+cpp method .",
    "for the rb(@xmath150)sr(@xmath10 ) manifold the @xmath123 curves exhibit the avoided crossing in place where the @xmath68 and @xmath67 states cross .",
    "since the @xmath68 and @xmath67 states are separated in energy by a much larger amount than the so constant @xmath151 , they preserve their hund ( a ) case character over most of the internuclear distances in the chemical range .",
    "however the corresponding bound levels may well be strongly coupled as it is the case for instance in the heavy alkali - metal dimers like rb@xmath9 @xcite . for the states that correlate with the rb(@xmath13)+sr(@xmath149 ) asymptote the character of hund s case ( c ) states is drastically changed , since the @xmath77 and @xmath76 , and also @xmath44 states are much closer in energy .",
    "therefore these states are strong mixtures of doublet and quartet states .",
    "it is also clear from figure [ hundc_vs_hunda ] that among the states which correlate with rb(@xmath13)+sr(@xmath152 ) there are states with @xmath123 and @xmath121 of very strong @xmath153 character . also , in view of such strong mixing",
    ", it is clear that the state @xmath123 which correlates with sr atomic clock line will have nonzero transition dipole moment at finite distances .",
    "hence , the vibrational states supported by such state might be accessible with dipole transitions .",
    "in this work we have explored the ground and excited states of the rbsr molecule , which is a good candidate paramagnetic , polar molecule and subject to intense experimental study .",
    "a primary goal of this paper was to provide the first calculation of potential energy curves for the rbsr curves and dipole moment matrix elements and comparison between two _ ab - initio _ methods : fci method with the use of ecp and cpp , and cc theory based methods used with small effective core potential .",
    "it is usually difficult to provide error bound for the _ ab - initio _ calculations , unless we deal with small , few - electron system @xcite , for which it is possible to study the convergence pattern not only for systematically increased gaussian basis set but also for number of excitations introduced to the electronic wavefunction .",
    "hence , for such complicated system as rbsr molecule application of two different methods provides a better starting point for further modelling of potential curves with help of high - resolution spectrosopy experiments .",
    "the discrepancies in calculations of potential energy curves between the methods used in this paper are very small for the ground state , for the states correlating with rb asymptotes and for the quartet states correlating with the strontium asymptotes .",
    "a bit larger discrepancies have been obtained for the doublet states of rb+sr(@xmath130 ) systems , although the equilibrium distances and harmonic constants are consistent . for the higher excited states the agreement is moderately good .    using both methods",
    "we have found that a very good agreement of the values of permanent dipole moments of the ground state rbsr system as well as doublet rb(@xmath130)+sr and rb+sr(@xmath130 ) states : interestingly enough , the permanent dipole moments of the excited states are very large .    finally , we have obtained the transition dipole moments for the excitations from the ground electronic state to rb(@xmath130)+sr and rb+sr(@xmath130 ) states .",
    "again , there is a good agreement between the two approaches used in this paper .",
    "interestingly enough we have found that there are non - zero transition dipole moments from the ground state to doublet rb+sr(@xmath130 ) .",
    "that means , the possibility of driving for the dipole transitions to the vibrational states supported by the electronic states that correlate with strongly forbidden @xmath154 lines of the strontium atom .",
