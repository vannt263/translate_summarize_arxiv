    "adaptive beamforming technology is of paramount importance in numerous signal processing applications such as radar , wireless communications , and sonar @xcite-@xcite . among various beamforming techniques , the beamformers according to the constrained minimum variance ( cmv ) criterion @xcite are prevalent , which minimize the total output power while maintaining the gain along the direction of the signal of interest ( soi ) .",
    "another alternative beamformer design is performed according to the constrained constant modulus ( ccm ) criterion , which is a positive measure @xcite of the average amount that the beamformer output deviates from a constant modulus condition .",
    "compared with the cmv , the ccm beamformers exhibit superior performance in many severe scenarios ( e.g. , steering vector mismatch ) since the positive measure provides more information for the parameter estimation .",
    "many adaptive algorithms have been developed according to the cmv and ccm criteria for implementation .",
    "a simple and popular one is stochastic gradient ( sg ) method @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a major drawback of the sg - based methods is that , when the number of elements in the filter is large , they always require a large amount of samples to reach the steady - state .",
    "furthermore , in dynamic scenarios , filters with many elements usually show poor performance in tracking signals embedded in interference and noise .",
    "reduced - rank signal processing was motivated to provide a way out of this dilemma @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for the application of beamforming , the reduced - rank technique project the received vector onto a low - dimension subspace and perform the filter optimization within this subspace .",
    "one popular reduced - rank scheme is the multistage wiener filter ( mswf ) , which employs the minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) @xcite , and its extended versions that utilize the cmv and ccm criteria were reported in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another technique that resembles the mswf is the auxiliary - vector filtering ( avf ) @xcite , @xcite . despite improved convergence and tracking performance achieved by these methods ,",
    "their implementations require high computational cost and suffer from numerical problems .",
    "a joint iterative optimization ( jio ) scheme , which was presented recently in @xcite , employs the cmv criterion with a low - complexity adaptive implementation to achieve better performance than the existing methods .",
    "considering the fact that the ccm - based beamformers outperform the cmv ones for constant modulus constellations , we propose a robust reduced - rank scheme according to the ccm criterion for the beamformer design .",
    "the proposed reduced - rank scheme consists of a bank of full - rank adaptive filters , which constitutes the transformation matrix , and an adaptive reduced - rank filter that operates at the output of the bank of filters .",
    "the transformation matrix projects the full - rank received vector onto a low - dimension , which is then processed by the reduced - rank filter to estimate the desired signal .",
    "the transformation matrix and the reduced - rank filter are computed based on the jio .",
    "the proposed scheme provides an iterative exchange of information between the transformation matrix and the reduced - rank filter , which leads to improved convergence and tracking ability and low - complexity cost .",
    "we devise two adaptive algorithms for the implementation of the proposed reduced - rank scheme .",
    "the first one employs the sg approach to jointly estimate the transformation matrix and the reduced - rank weight vector subject to a constraint on the array response .",
    "the second proposed algorithm is extended from the first one and reformulates the transformation matrix subject to an orthogonal constraint .",
    "the gram schmidt ( gs ) technique @xcite is employed to realize the reformulation .",
    "the performance of the second method outperforms the first one .",
    "simulation results are given to demonstrate the preferable performance and stability achieved by the proposed algorithms versus the existing methods in typical scenarios .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath0 narrowband signals impinge on an uniform linear array ( ula ) of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) sensor elements .",
    "the sources are assumed to be in the far field with directions of arrival ( doas ) @xmath3,  ,@xmath4 .",

    "@xmath17 is the source data , @xmath18 is temporarily white sensor noise , which is assumed to be a zero - mean spatially and gaussian process , @xmath19 is the observation size of snapshots , and @xmath20  stands for transpose .",
    "the estimated desired signal is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22^{t}\\in\\mathbb c^{m\\times 1}$ ] is the complex weight vector , and @xmath23 stands for hermitian transpose .",
    "let us consider the full - rank ccm filter for beamforming , which can be computed by minimizing the following cost function @xmath24^{2}\\big\\},~~ \\textrm{subject~to}~~{\\boldsymbol w}^{h}(i){\\boldsymbol a}(\\theta_{0})=1 % \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the direction of the soi and @xmath26 denotes the corresponding normalized steering vector .",
    "the cost function is the expected deviation of the squared modulus of the array output to a constant subject to the constraint on the array response , which is set to capture the power of the desired signal and ensure the convexity of the cost function .",
    "the weight expression obtained from ( [ 3 ] ) is @xmath27\\boldsymbol a(\\theta_0)}{\\boldsymbol a^h(\\theta_0)\\boldsymbol r^{-1}(i)\\boldsymbol a(\\theta_0)}\\big\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29 $ ] , and @xmath30 denotes complex conjugate .",

    "we keep the time index in @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the same reason .",
    "it is obvious that the calculation of weight vector requires high complexity due to the matrix inversion .",
    "the sg type algorithms can be employed to reduce the computational load but still suffer from slow convergence and tracking performance when the dimension @xmath1 is large .",
    "the reduced - rank schemes like mswf and avf can be used to improve the performance but still need high computational cost and suffer from numerical problems .",
