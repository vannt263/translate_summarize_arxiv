    "he showed that the total curvature of any smooth non - trivial knot is at least @xmath18 . for a polygonal knot in @xmath9",
    "its total curvature can be defined as the summation of all angles between every pair of adjacent sticks .",
    "this quantity says how much the modeled polymer turn in space , therefore is expected to have some connection with physical properties of molecular chains . in @xcite , using numerical simulations , the total curvature of polygons was scaled as a function of the length of polygons for each knot with up to six crossings .",
