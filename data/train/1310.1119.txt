    "in an experiment on the @xmath0 reaction at @xmath5  gev @xcite the besiii collaboration reported a peak seen in the @xmath6 invariant mass distribution just about 10 mev above threshold .",
    "the peak was identified as a new particle , the @xmath2 .",
    "the authors assume in the paper that the @xmath6 pair is created in a @xmath7-wave and then the @xmath2 state , coupling to @xmath6 , has @xmath8 to match , together with the pion , the quantum numbers @xmath9 of the virtual photon from the @xmath10 pair . however , they also state that the experiment does not exclude other spin - parity assignments . on the other hand , since the @xmath6 has charge , the isospin must be @xmath11",
    ".    bumps close to the threshold of a pair of particles are sometimes identified as new particles , but they can also be a reflection of a resonance below threshold .",
    "indeed , in a similar reaction , @xmath12 @xcite , the belle collaboration reported a bump close to the threshold in the @xmath13 invariant mass distribution , which was tentatively interpreted as a new resonance . yet , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the bump was better interpreted in terms of a @xmath13 molecular state , below the @xmath13 threshold ( so called x(3700 ) ) , that had been predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and has also been found theoretically in other works @xcite .",
    "similarly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath14 threshold peak seen in the @xmath15 reaction @xcite was better interpreted as a signal of the @xmath16 resonance , below the @xmath14 threshold , which couples strongly to @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "another such case has been recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a bump close to threshold in the @xmath17 invariant mass distribution , seen in the @xmath18 decay in ref .",
    "@xcite , is interpreted as a signal of the formation of an @xmath19 resonance , predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which couples mostly to the @xmath20 .    in the present case one investigates a peak close to threshold of @xmath21 .",
    "hence , the first question to ask is what we know about the interaction between this pair of mesons and whether a bound state of @xmath21 with isospin @xmath11 , as in the present reaction , can be formed .",
    "an answer to this question can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , where vector - vector hidden charm states are investigated using an interaction from an extrapolation of the local hidden gauge approach @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite several states are found which can be matched with some x , y , z states reported in the literature , and there is only one bound state of @xmath21 in @xmath11 , with quantum numbers @xmath22 with a mass around 3920 mev and a width of about 150 mev .",
    "the mass of the state can have large uncertainties since it is generated by the exchange of @xmath23 in the @xmath24-channel , which is suppressed by the large @xmath23 mass , such that other subleading mechanisms of the interaction could play some role .",
    "the @xmath11 only appears in the state @xmath25 , since the tensor state is the one where the interaction is stronger .",
    "it is thus tempting to investigate whether the peak seen in the besiii reaction @xcite can be interpreted in terms of such a state below the @xmath21 threshold .",
    "this is one of the aims of the present paper , but simultaneously we shall also investigate other possibilities , like the one suggested in the experimental paper @xcite of a @xmath8 state , or even the result of using simply phase space in @xmath26-waves .",
    "one element of information that makes this investigation opportune is the fact that if the state were a @xmath8 produced in @xmath7-wave , as assumed in the experimental work @xcite , it easily decays into @xmath27 exchanging a @xmath26 meson in the @xmath24-channel .",
    "this is also the decay channel of the @xmath28 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which would then have the same quantum numbers as the state claimed in ref .",
    "however , while a peak is clearly seen in the @xmath27 invariant mass distribution for the case of the @xmath28 , no trace of a peak is seen around 4025 mev ( see fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) in spite of using the same reaction and the same @xmath10 energy .",
    "the argument exposed above gets extra support when one digs a bit more on the reaction used .",
    "the energy of 4260 mev for the @xmath10 pair is not chosen arbitrarily but it corresponds to the energy of the x(4260 ) discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite and later on reported in ref .",
    "this resonance was interpreted in ref .",
    "@xcite as a molecular state of @xmath29 , in analogy to the @xmath30 , which was interpreted as a @xmath31 in ref .",
    "it has also been suggested a @xmath32 bound state  @xcite , because of the proximity of the threshold to the mass of the state , or as a hadrocharmonium state  @xcite ( see also a discussion in ref .",
    "actually , the structure obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the x(4260 ) was of a @xmath23 , together with a cluster of @xmath33 forming the @xmath34 . in the decay of this state",
    "the @xmath34 goes to @xmath35 .",
    "it is quite interesting to see that in a posterior experiment  @xcite the dalitz plot for the decay of the x(4260 ) into @xmath36 , as well as the mass distributions , shows a clear correlation of the @xmath35 pair around the @xmath34 mass .",
    "the @xmath37 states in the molecular state of the x(4260 ) are all in @xmath7-wave in ref .",
    "@xcite , hence the molecule contains an @xmath7-wave @xmath38 component to start with , that upon interaction can lead to @xmath7-wave resonances like the @xmath28 , and the @xmath2 if the quantum numbers are those assumed in ref .",
    "yet , as mentioned before , there is no trace of a peak around 4025 mev in the invariant mass of @xmath38 .    with respect to quantum numbers",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath10 does not have a defined @xmath39 .",
    "even if one produces the x(4260 ) , this resonance does not have @xmath39 defined in the pdg @xcite , and even if one assumes it to be the @xmath40 of ref .",
    "@xcite , one must note that in the @xmath10 reaction at that energy not only this broad resonance is produced but it is accompanied by a background with equal strength @xcite .",
    "thus , g parity is a quantum number not to worry about in the reaction .",
    "the isospin of the @xmath21 state , however , is determined from the charged nature of the detected @xmath21 state . for this same reason one does not have to consider c parity .",
    "hence , @xmath41 are the basic quantum numbers to worry about .",
    "there is another element worth considering with respect to associating a new resonance to the @xmath21 mass spectrum of ref .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that a single channel with an energy independent potential can generate bound states but not resonance states above threshold . in the local hidden gauge approach",
    "the potentials in the heavy quark sector are practically energy independent and , furthermore , the mixing of channels is small , corresponding to subleading terms in the heavy quark mass ( @xmath42 ) counting , and even smaller than the diagonal terms for @xmath11 , which are also suppressed in that counting @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that in works like @xcite which use only the restrictions of heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) but no specific dynamics , mixing of channels is allowed .",
    "yet , from the perspective of the dynamics of the local hidden gauge extrapolations used in the heavy quark sector , a resonant state of @xmath21 above threshold is not easy to support .",
    "there are further considerations to make .",
    "indeed , the threshold energy for @xmath43 is 4160 mev , which is only 100 mev below the energy of the @xmath10 initial state .",
    "there are only 100 mev of phase space in a reaction with three particles in the final state , where the invariant mass distribution for @xmath21 goes to zero at the beginning and the end of the phase space .",
    "this by itself creates a bump narrower than 100 mev , in particular if the reaction occurs in @xmath26-waves .",
    "nevertheless , as usual when a claim is made of a new resonance , theoreticians dig into possible answers for the structure of the new state . in this sense",
    "it is worth quoting theoretical work done in this direction . in ref .",
    "@xcite hqss is used to make predictions for states containing one @xmath26 or @xmath44 and one @xmath45 or @xmath46 . assuming the x(3872 ) and @xmath47 to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 molecules , the authors predict a series of new hadronic molecules , including the @xmath28 and the @xmath2 .",
    "the latter ones would correspond to bound states ( with uncertainties of about 50 mev in the binding ) of @xmath50 and @xmath21 respectively , with quantum numbers @xmath51 .",
    "it is to be stressed that the states , even with uncertainties , always come in the bound region . in refs .",
    "@xcite , using qcd sum rules and assuming a structure of @xmath21 , the authors obtain a possible @xmath52 state compatible with the @xmath2 albeit with around @xmath53 mev uncertainty in the energy .",
    "recently , a study of the @xmath3 system has also been done within qcd sum rules , projecting the correlation function on spin - parity @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 , and in the three cases a state with mass @xmath55 mev is found  @xcite .",
    "the central value of the mass of these states is more in line with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , although with the error bar , they could also be related to a resonance . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath56 state is looked up from a different perspective and , using pion exchange , a @xmath21 state with @xmath52 compatible with the @xmath2 is obtained .",
    "one should note that the input used in this latter work is quite different to the one in ref .",
    "@xcite since in hqss the pion exchange is subdominant @xcite .",
    "one should also note that for @xmath11 states , there is a cancellation for equal masses ( or large momenta ) of @xmath57 between the exchange of these pseudoscalars , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a tetraquark structure and qcd sum rules , a state with @xmath58 compatible with @xmath2 is obtained , once again with a large error in the energy of 190 mev .",
    "these would be the quantum numbers of the state predicted in ref .",
    "a different idea is exposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a pion and the @xmath21 state are produced from the x(4260 ) and the @xmath21 state is left to interact with the pion being a spectator ( initial single - pion emission mechanism ) .",
    "although it is not mentioned whether the @xmath21 interaction produces a resonance with certain quantum numbers , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors show that the mechanism can produce some enhancement in the @xmath21 invariant mass distribution just above threshold .",
    "as we can see , the theoretical panorama is rather diverse and uncertainties too large to serve as a support for the experimental claim of the @xmath2 . in the present paper",
    "we shall take a different path and investigate different ways in which the experimental data can be reproduced .",
    "the fact that we shall be able to describe the data with different options will render the claims for the @xmath2 weak . together with the former arguments about the difficulty to get a resonant state of two heavy mesons above threshold , the case for the @xmath2 with that mass is further weakened , but the peak observed being a consequence of a @xmath21 state below threshold remains a clear possibility .",
    "the production of @xmath60 in @xmath26-waves is one of the options that we shall exploit here , keeping in mind the possibility that the peak seen in ref .",
    "@xcite could be the @xmath61 state predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite below the @xmath60 threshold .",
    "we first look at a mechanism that reassures us that the production of this @xmath62 resonance is possible in this reaction .",
    "several mechanisms could be thought of , but it suffices to look at the one of fig .  [ react ] .     in @xmath26-waves .",

    "( [ react ] ) . on the other hand , in the reaction depicted in fig .",
    "[ react ] , the external three momenta of the @xmath44 and @xmath74 are small , a fact which allows us to drop the @xmath75 component of the polarization vectors , as done in ref .  @xcite .",

    "it is also interesting to see that the combination @xmath78 contains spin @xmath79 for the vector mesons .",
