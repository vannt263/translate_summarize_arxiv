    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system in strong magnetic fields has been studied intensively for many years @xcite .",
    "there are numerous experimetal and theoretical investigations concentrating on the low density electron system in high magnetic fields when the electron correlation becomes strong and the system can be considered as a coulomb liquid or wigner lattice@xcite . in order to study the characteristics of the 2d electrons in a magnetic field , the cyclotron resonance ( cr )",
    "is considered as one of the basic techniques , and important information about the 2d electron system can be obtained from the cr .",
    "though there are many theoretical works considering the cr in the highly correlated electron liquid and correlated electrons which form a wigner crystal on the surface of liquid helium @xcite , the cr of highly correlated electrons in semiconductor heterostructures is still an open question .    in a magnetic field normal to the plane ,",
    "the kinetic energy of 2d electrons is quenched and electrons execute a cyclotron motion with orbit radius propotional to the magnetic length @xmath1 which decreases with increasing magnetic field @xmath2 . once @xmath2 becomes sufficiently high so that @xmath3 is small compared with the typical mutual distance between electrons , the crystallization of the electron system into a wigner crystal is expected if the electron density is sufficiently low . in semiconductor heterostructures ,",
    "when the mutual coulomb energies are dominant , a wigner crystal or a charge density wave may be formed in the quantizing magnetic field limit .",
    "recently , an insulating state was observed on monolayer systems @xcite , such a state is interpreted as a wigner crystal pinned by the disorder in the sample @xcite .",
    "the early theory by fukuyama and lee@xcite , which considered the pinning of the charge density waves of the 2d electrons in heterostructures under the influence of the magnetic field , has predicted that the absorption lineshape of the system has double resonance peaks : one is located at the cyclotron frequency and the other related to the impurity pinning . in this theory , the magnetic field is treated classically and the impurity potential is assumed as short - ranged ones , and the pinning mode depends on the bulk compressibility of the substrate materials .    in this work",
    ", we present the theoretical analysis of the dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) and the linewidth of the cr due to ionized impurity scattering of the 2d electron systems in quantizing magnetic fields .",
    "electrons are assumed to form a wigner crystal in which the electrons are localized and oscillate around their equilibrium positions , and the electron correlation is taken into account through the wigner phonons .",
    "the numerical results of the cr linewidth are compared with experiments in the al@xmath4ga@xmath5as heterostructures    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
