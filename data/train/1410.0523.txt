    "we explicitly assume low redshifts such that the velocity @xmath8 is the dominant contribution , and we further consider all fields relative to their present - day values at @xmath11 .    as the shift @xmath12 enters the calculation of distance moduli @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the luminosity distance , observed absolute magnitudes @xmath15 differ from their true values @xmath16 .",
    "we thus have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the apparent magnitude , the function @xmath19 accounts for luminosity evolution , and @xmath20 is the @xmath21-correction ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blanton & roweis 2007 ) ) . on scales where linear theory provides an adequate description ,",
    "the variation @xmath22 of magnitudes distributed over the sky is systematic , and therefore , contains information on the peculiar velocity field .    given a suitable parameterized model @xmath23 of the radial velocity field , the idea is now to maximize the probability of observing galaxies with magnitudes @xmath24 given only their redshifts and angular positions @xmath25 on the sky , i.e. , @xmath26 where we assume that redshift errors can be neglected ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nusser  2011 ) ) , @xmath27 denotes the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) , and the corresponding limiting magnitudes @xmath28 depend on @xmath23 through the cosmological redshift @xmath6 . here",
    "the motivation is to obtain a maximum - likelihood estimate of @xmath23 by finding the set of velocity model parameters which minimizes the spread in the observed magnitudes .",

    "* nusser  ( 2011 ) ) used it to constrain bulk flows in the local universe from the 2mass redshift survey ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we report results obtained from applying the luminosity method to a subset of roughly half a million galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for additional details , see feix  2014 ) ) .    .",
    "in our analysis , we used the latest version of the nyu value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; ( * ? ? ? * blanton 2005 ) ) .",
    "giving the largest spectroscopically complete galaxy sample , we adopted ( petrosian ) @xmath29-band magnitudes , and chose the subsample nyu - vagc safe to minimize incompleteness and systematics .",
    "our final sample contained only galaxies with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( relative to the cmb frame ) .",
    "in addition , we employed a suite of galaxy mock catalogs mimicking the known systematics of the data .    .",
    "we considered a bin - averaged velocity model @xmath33 in two redshift bins , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for each bin ,",
    "the velocity field was further decomposed into spherical harmonics , i.e. @xmath36 where the sum over @xmath37 is cut at some maximum value @xmath38 . because the sdss data cover only part of the sky , the inferred @xmath39 are not statistically independent .",
    "the impact of the angular mask was studied with the help of suitable galaxy mock catalogs . the monopole term ( @xmath40 ) was not included since it is degenerate with an overall shift of magnitudes .    .",
    "reliably measuring the galaxy lf represents a key step in our approach . to assess the robustness of our results with respect to different lf models , we analyzed the data using lf estimators based on a schechter form and a more flexible spline - based model , together with several combinations and variations thereof .",
    "for simplicity , we also assumed a linear dependence of the luminosity evolution with redshift .    .",
    "accounting for known systematic errors in the sdss photometry , our `` bulk flow '' measurements are consistent with a standard @xmath3cdm cosmology at a @xmath41@xmath42 confidence level in both redshift bins .",
    "a joint analysis of the corresponding three cartesian components confirmed this result . to characterize higher - order moments as well , we further obtained direct constraints on the angular velocity power spectrum @xmath43 up to the octupole contribution .",
    "the estimated @xmath44 were found compatible to be with the theoretical power spectra of the @xmath3cdm cosmology .",
    "obtained from the nyu - vagc : shown is the derived @xmath45 as a function of @xmath2 for both redshift bins ( left panel ) and the first redshift bin with @xmath46 only ( right panel ) , adopting different estimators of the lf ( solid , dashed , and dotted lines ) . ]    . assuming a prior on the @xmath44 as dictated by the @xmath3cdm model with fixed hubble constant and density parameters , we independently estimated the parameter @xmath2 which determines the amplitude of the velocity field .",
    "due to the presence of a dipole - like tilt in the galaxy magnitudes ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* padmanabhan  2008 ) ) , the obtained raw estimates of @xmath2 were expected to be biased toward larger values ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "after correcting for this magnitude tilt with the help of our mocks ( fig.[fig2 ] ) , we eventually found @xmath47 for the combination of both redshift bins and @xmath48 for the low-@xmath5 bin only , where the low accuracy is due to the limited number of galaxies .",
    "this confirms our method s validity in view of future datasets with larger sky coverage and better photometric calibration .",
    "estimated from mock galaxy catalogs : shown are the recovered histograms ( black lines ) and respective gaussian fits with ( solid lines ) and without ( dashed lines ) the inclusion of a systematic ( randomly oriented ) tilt in the galaxy magnitudes , using the information in both redshift bins ( left ) and the bin with @xmath46 only ( right ) . ]",
    "a very interesting aspect of our luminosity - based approach is the possibility to place bounds on the growth rate of density perturbations , @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the linear galaxy bias ) , by modeling the large - scale velocity field directly from the observed clustering of galaxies in redshift space ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nusser & davis 1994 ) ) .",
    "such bounds are complementary to and  regarding ongoing and future redshift surveys  expected to be competitive with those obtained from redshift - space distortions ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "how well the method could constrain @xmath51 at @xmath1 from sdss galaxies , we used mocks generated from the millennium simulation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* springel  2005 ) ; ) to create full - sky catalogs which otherwise shared all characteristics of the real sdss data . adopting a radial velocity model proportional to the true one smoothed over spheres of @xmath52 mpc radius ,",
    "the luminosity method was applied to samples with around @xmath53 galaxies and correctly recovered the velocity field .",
    "the error on the proportionality constant typically yielded @xmath54@xmath55 if only the contribution of multipoles with @xmath56 ( an appropriate value for the sdss geometry ) is taken into account . assuming an accurate velocity reconstruction for these modes",
    ", we expect a similar situation for @xmath51 .",
    "a further complication is that the angular mask may introduce bias as a consequence of multipole mixing .",
    "this and other technical issues mainly related to the reconstruction of the velocity field are currently under detailed investigation .",
    "current and next - generation spectroscopic surveys are designed to reduce data - inherent systematics because of larger sky coverage and improved photometric calibration in ground- and space - based experiments ( e.g , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* levi  2013 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
