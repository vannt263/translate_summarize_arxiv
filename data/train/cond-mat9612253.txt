    "persistent current ( pc ) in mesoscopic structures@xcite has been extensively studied during the last decade both experimentally@xcite and theoretically .",
    "the theoretical investigations concentrated on a role of different degrees of disorder@xcite and on the role of the interaction between electrons@xcite .",
    "the pc is a reaction of a system to an applied flux @xmath13 , or , equivalently , it can be described as a change of the energy of the system due to twisted boundary conditions . in a two - dimensional system which forms a cylinder",
    "the twisted conditions mean that the wave function of a system acquires a factor @xmath14 with a circulation of one electron around the axis of the cylinder .",
    "here @xmath4 is the flux quanta .",
    "the flux @xmath13 is related to the tangential component @xmath15 of the vector potential @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the radius of the cylinder . for a system with galilean invariance the following simple statement is correct .",
    "the energy of a state with a given value of tangential component @xmath18 of the total momentum depends on @xmath15 as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the number of electrons and @xmath21 is their total mass , @xmath22 being the mass of one electron .",
    "the 2d current density @xmath23 for a state with fixed @xmath18 is    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the area of the cylinder surface and @xmath26 . at @xmath27 eq .",
    "( [ london ] ) reminds the london equation for a superconducting current . in this case",
    "@xmath28 should be the superfluid density .    a general derivation of eq .",
    "( [ london ] ) , given above , is misleading because pc should be defined as a current in the ground state rather than in a state with fixed @xmath18 . in two- or three - dimensional systems of free electrons the derivative of the energy with respect to @xmath15",
    "can not be taken in such a simple way because the intervals of @xmath13 , where branches of spectrum with different @xmath18 change each other in the ground state , tend to zero with increasing system size .    for electrons in a periodic potential",
    "the situation is typically similar .",
    "the derivative of energy with respect to the flux is large for a given branch .",
    "however , different branches replace each other in the ground state at such small intervals of @xmath13 that the derivative taken at a given total quasimomentum @xmath18 does not reflect properties of the ground state .",
    "scalapino et al.@xcite considered a tight binding model on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "their computations show that at filling factor @xmath29 the first level crossing occurs at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the size of the system .",
    "their general conclusion is that the superfluid density , as found from the relation between @xmath23 and @xmath15 , is zero for free electrons in the tight binding model .",
    "we show in this paper that this is not always the case .",
    "namely , we consider a 2d system of free electrons on a square lattice in a tight binding approximation at filling factor @xmath32 .",
    "the shape of the system is assumed to be a rectangle with arbitrary aspect ratio .",
    "we demonstrate below that at @xmath33 the two - dimensional pc density does not depend on the size of the system and has a form :    @xmath34    here @xmath35 is the electron mass , @xmath11 being the nearest - neighbor hopping energy .",
    "the two - dimensional density is determined as @xmath36 , where @xmath12 is the lattice constant . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a system of spinless fermions .",
    "the generalization to the case of non - interacting fermions with spin is straightforward .",
    "the constant @xmath37 shows that the minimum of energy occurs not at zero flux .",
    "in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ london ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) describes pc in the ground state of the system which is a periodic function of @xmath13 with period @xmath2 .",
    "( [ result ] ) is valid within the interval @xmath38 , or @xmath39 , and is to be repeated periodically for other values of flux .",
    "here @xmath5 is an integer which depends on the aspect ratio of the cylinder and on the type of the boundary conditions imposed in the direction of the cylinder axis . the first term is shown to be independent on the aspect ratio .",
    "we found pc to have an order of magnitude of the london current .",
    "note that this result gives substantially larger pc than it is prescribed in the ballistic regime by the so - called @xmath40-channel approximation ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "namely , our exact solution gives pc larger by a factor of @xmath41 for the @xmath42 square .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the fact that in the case of flat fermi surface all transverse channels are coherent .    considering the 3d system constructed of a large number of coaxial closely packed 2d cylinders",
    "we show that it mimics the meissner effect and the quantization of flux trapped in the opening .",
    "these properties appear since the fermi surface at @xmath32 is flat and no branch crossings occur in large intervals of @xmath13 .",
    "say , for a square array no branch crossing occurs in the whole interval @xmath43 , which means that @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , we are discussing a mesoscopic effect . the expression eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) is valid only at mesoscopically small temperature , and the ideal diamagnetism occurs for mesoscopically small values of magnetic field :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the spacing between neighboring coaxial cylinders .",
    "the effective size @xmath47 is given by    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the length of the cylinders and @xmath6 and @xmath5 are integers determined by the aspect ratio @xmath50 ( see below ) .",
    "thus , this system can be classified as a `` mesoscopic superconductor . ''",
    "note that the average distance between energy levels in a 2d system is proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath52 behavior in the above equations is also a result of the flat fermi surface at @xmath32 . as it is seen from the calculations , all relevant interlevel distances are of the order of @xmath53 , rather than @xmath54 .",
    "since both @xmath55 and @xmath7 vanish at large @xmath17 , there are no real critical phenomena in this model system .",
    "consider a rectangle of @xmath56 lattice sites with periodic boundary conditions twisted in both directions by @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this corresponds to a toroidal geometry where @xmath59 is the flux through the crossection of the torus and @xmath60 is the flux through the opening .",
    "the single - electron energies have the form    @xmath61 +    \\cos\\left[\\frac{2\\pi}{l_y}(n_y-\\phi_y)\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\label{epsilon1}\\ ] ]    where we introduce dimensionless @xmath62 to simplify the notation .",
    "the values of integer quantum numbers @xmath63 and @xmath64 are restricted to the rectangle @xmath65 ( first brillouin zone ) . to find the energy of the ground state one has to sum @xmath66 over the values @xmath67 inside the fermi surface .    in principle",
    ", the calculation of pc can be performed either at constant number of particles @xmath20 or at constant value of chemical potential @xmath68 . generally speaking ,",
    "these two definitions are not equivalent .",
    "it is important to note that such a problem does not exist at @xmath32 at even numbers of @xmath69 at least .",
    "as one can see from the eq .",
    "( [ epsilon1 ] ) , every single - electron energy changes sign under the transformation @xmath70 .",
    "it follows , that at @xmath32 due to the electron - hole symmetry the chemical potential @xmath68 is zero at any value of flux and at any temperature .",
    "thus , if the flux changes at @xmath71 , the number of particles in the ground state of the system does not change and if the flux changes at a given number of particles such that @xmath32 , the chemical potential does not change .",
    "let us define the fermi `` surface '' ( fs ) in two - dimensional @xmath72 space by the equation    @xmath73    considering @xmath72 as continuous variables .",
    "it is easy to see that the fs forms a rhomb at any value of flux .",
    "change in the flux produces a shift of the fs as a whole without changing its shape .",
    "first , let us consider for simplicity a square sample , @xmath74 .",
    "the fs forms a square shown in fig .",
    "at @xmath75 some of the allowed single - electron states lie exactly at the sides of this square .",
    "all the states inside the square and 1/2 of the states at the sides of the square are occupied .",
    "all the states at the sides have the same energy so the occupation numbers of these states are not defined , while the many - electron ground state is degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy is lifted at infinitazimally small values of @xmath76 .",
    "suppose that @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "then fs is shifted to the right ( see fig .",
    "all occupation numbers become defined .",
    "namely , the states at the right side of initial square get occupied and those at the left side become empty . note that the occupation numbers of as many as @xmath79 states change when @xmath80 crosses zero .",
    "it is easy to see that the occupation numbers are constant throughout the interval @xmath81 . the total energy decreases with @xmath80 and then increases again .",
    "at @xmath82 all electrons jump one step to the right and the fermi surface restores its original position with respect to the lattice of integer numbers @xmath83 .",
    "the total energy thus returns to the same value as at @xmath84 .",
    "it follows that the total quasimomentum of electron system in the ground state does not change through all this interval and no branch crossing occurs . then the sum over the occupied states can be easily evaluated :    @xmath85 +    \\sum_{n_x =- l/2 + 1}^{l/2}\\epsilon(n_x,0)\\\\ & = & 8t\\ \\text{re}\\frac{e^{2\\pi i / l}}{(e^{2\\pi i / l}-1)^2 }    \\left[\\left(1+e^{2\\pi i / l}\\right)e^{-i2\\pi\\phi_x / l}+       2e^{-i2\\pi\\phi_y / l}\\right ]    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this expression is exact in the region @xmath86 . in the limit of large @xmath31 , the @xmath76-dependent part of the energy , @xmath87 , can be written in the form :    @xmath88 . \\label{energy1}\\ ] ]    repeating eq .",
