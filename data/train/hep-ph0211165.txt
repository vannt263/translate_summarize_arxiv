    "in nonleptonic hyperon decays such as @xmath4 it is possible to search for @xmath0 violation by comparing the angular distribution with that of the corresponding anti - hyperon decay  @xcite .",

    "the interesting observable is a correlation in the decay distribution of the form @xmath9 the branching ratio for this mode is @xmath10 , and the parameter @xmath11 has been measured to be @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 violation in question involves a comparison of the parameter @xmath11 with the corresponding parameter @xmath13 from the reaction @xmath14    to obtain polarized @xmath5 s with known polarization , it is necessary to study the double decay chain @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this eventually leads to the experimental observable being sensitive to the _ sum _ of @xmath0 violation in the @xmath16 decay and @xmath0 violation in the @xmath5 decay .    in both reactions , @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 the final state can be reached from the initial state via @xmath19 or @xmath20 transitions .",
    "it is known that due to the existence of a strong @xmath19 rule for nonleptonic hyperon decay , the dominant contribution to the @xmath0-violating asymmetries arises from interference between an @xmath21-wave and a @xmath22-wave within the @xmath19 transition  @xcite .",
