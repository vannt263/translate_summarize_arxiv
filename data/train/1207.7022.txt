    "sonoluminescence is the intriguing phenomenon of strong light flashes from tiny bubbles in a liquid @xcite .",
    "the bubbles are driven by an ultrasonic wave and need to be filled with atomic species .",
    "approximating the emitted light by blackbody radiation indicates very high temperatures . although sonoluminescence has been studied extensively , a complete understanding of the mechanisms which concentrate the energy of acoustic vibrations seems still missing @xcite .",
    "moreover , the actual role of atomic species inside the cavitating bubble seems to remain controversial .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to emphasise that quantum optical heating mechanisms of trapped particles via highly inhomogenous electric fields can play an important role in creating very high temperatures in sonoluminescence experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , we suggest that it is possible to increase the temperature inside the cavitating bubble even further with the help of appropriately detuned laser fields .",
    "to do so , we emphasise that energy - absorbing measurements on one component of a composite quantum system can have a huge effect on the energy of the total system @xcite . in addition",
    ", we point out close analogies between ion trap and sonoluminescence experiments . for example , it is well known that it is possible to cool ions in ion trap experiments with red - detuned laser fields to nanokelvin temperatures @xcite .",
    "blue detuned laser fields heat ions in ion trap experiments very rapidly and result therefore in their immediate rejection from the trap . taking a more general point of view than in our earlier work @xcite , this paper tries to provide more insight into possible quantum optical heating effects in sonoluminescence experiments .    in the next section ,",
    "we consider composite quantum systems with repeated energy - absorbing measurements on one systems component .",
    "a simple example of such a system is a well localised atom ( or ion ) in free space which interacts with the surrounding free radiation field @xcite .",
    "another example is a trapped atom ( or ion ) with quantised motional states in a free radiation field @xcite . in these two systems ,",
    "repeated energy - absorbing measurements on one system component  the free radiation field  occur naturally in the presence of a photon - absorbing environment , like the walls of the laboratory .",
    "when the atom ( or ion ) is driven by external laser fields , these measurements manifest themselves in the spontaneous emission of photons .",
    "quantum optical models based on the assumption of environment - induced photon - absorbing measurements are in general in very good agreement with experiments @xcite .    in the third section of this paper ,",
    "we emphasise common features between ion trap and sonoluminescence experiments . more concretely",
    ", we assume that the particles inside the cavitating bubble are so strongly confined that their motion becomes quantised . in addition , we assume that a weak but highly inhomogenous electric field establishes a relatively strong coupling between the electronic states and the motional states of the trapped particles .",
    "such a field occurs naturally during rapid bubble deformations .",
    "for example , it can be generated via the formation of a plasma inside the cavitating bubble @xcite .",
    "the effect of an inhomogenous electric field is similar to the effect of laser driving in ion trap experiments . using a quantum optical master equation @xcite , we predict a rapid exponential growth of the mean number of phonons per particle , ie .  heating . in the case of rapidly changing system parameters ,",
    "numerical simulations predict an even faster temperature growth @xcite .    finally , we point out that the above close analogy between ion trap and sonoluminescence experiments suggests that it is possible to significantly increase the temperature inside a cavitating bubble via the application of blue - detuned laser light",
    ". recent measurements of the spectrum of the emitted light in sonoluminescence experiments in ionic liquids show relatively sharp emission lines in the optical regime @xcite .",
    "these verify the availability of atomic transitions which could be driven by laser light during the final stages of the bubble collapse phase . choosing the detuning of the applied laser fields",
    "appropriately should allow us to control the temperature of the particles inside a cavitating bubble analogously to the manipulation of the temperature of ions in ion trap experiments .",
    "since the corresponding heating rates can be very high @xcite , we expect that it is possible to significantly increase the temperature of the particles inside a cavitating bubble with blue - detuned laser fields .",
    "in quantum systems with unitary evolutions , the total energy is a conserved quantity , since the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath0 always commutes with itself @xmath1=0)$ ] .",
    "however , this argument does not apply to open quantum systems .",
    "for example , the spontaneous emission of a photon is always related to the loss of energy from its source @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we discuss a mechanism which can be used to change the energy of a composite quantum system . to do so , we consider a composite quantum system with two interacting components @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we assume that system @xmath3 experiences a sequence of energy - absorbing measurements .",
    "let us first have a closer look at a single energy - absorbing measurement on a quantum system . for simplicity , we consider a system with discrete energy eigenvalues @xmath4 and denote its energy eigenstates by @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the ground state .",
    "suppose the system is initially in @xmath7 .",
    "then the probability of measuring @xmath4 equals @xmath8 in case of an energy - absorbing measurement , the system is immediately after the measurement in its lowest energy eigenstate @xmath6 .",
    "this means , repeating the measurement , the lowest energy value @xmath9 is obtained with probability one .",
    "we now have a closer look at a composite quantum system with two interacting subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath0 of such a system can always be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 accounts for the energy of subsystem @xmath2 , @xmath12 accounts for the energy of subsystem @xmath3 , while @xmath13 denotes the interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "suppose , an energy - absorbing measurement is performed on subsystem @xmath3 .",
    "the possible outcomes of this measurement are the energy eigenvalues @xmath4 and the energy eigenstates @xmath14 of the hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "if the total system is initially in a state @xmath15 , the measurement initiates a transformation of the form latexmath:[\\ ] ] one can show that @xmath84 for all phonon number states @xmath85 .",
    "this means , the creation of a phonon is always slightly more likely than the annihilation of a phonon . as a consequence , the master equation in eq .",
    "( [ master2 ] ) does not possess a stationary state solution .",
    "the mean phonon number @xmath70 increases until the inhomogenous electric field inside the bubble becomes too small and the coupling constant @xmath64 no longer obeys the conditions in eq .",
    "( [ par ] ) .",
    "the previous subsection reveals a close analogy between ion trap and sonoluminescence experiments .",
    "for example , in both kinds of experiments , particles experience very strong trapping potentials .",
    "one way of obtaining a rough estimate for the relevant phonon frequency @xmath43 in a cavitating bubble is to notice that the volume of the bubble equals @xmath86 , if @xmath87 is its radius .",
    "this means , on average , each atom occupies a volume of @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the number of atoms inside the bubble .",
    "the radius @xmath90 which corresponds to this volume can be used as an estimate for @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) . for @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "nm , we obtain a @xmath59 of about @xmath93 nm . the argon atom mass of @xmath94 kg hence suggests typical phonon frequencies @xmath43 for argon ions of about @xmath95mhz .",
    ", then @xmath59 reduces to @xmath96 angstrom , which corresponds to a value close to the van der waals volume for argon and an even higher phonon frequency @xmath43 . ] due to the presence of other particles inside the bubble , this number is probably only a lower bound . for comparison ,",
    "let us mention that the phonon frequency @xmath43 of ion trap experiments is usually of the order of @xmath97mhz @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent measurements of the spectrum of the emitted light in sonoluminescence experiments in ionic liquids show relatively sharp emission lines in the optical regime @xcite .",
    "these verify the availability of atomic transitions which could be driven by laser light .",
    "the fact that there are strongly confined particles inside a cavitating bubble therefore suggests that it is possible to control the temperature of a cavitating bubble via the application of appropriately detuned laser fields . like an inhomogeneous electric field ,",
    "laser fields are able to establish a strong coupling between the electronic and the motional states of trapped particles . combined with a non - zero spontaneous photon emission rate",
    ", they are able to promote the creation of phonons at a much higher rate than the annihilation of phonons .",
    "this means , depending on the respective laser detunings , they should be able to cool and to heat the particles inside a cavitating bubble on very short time scales @xcite .",
    "more concretely , when applying a laser field , we essentially replace the electric field @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) by a time - dependent electric field of the form @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the frequency of the applied laser field . to remove the time - dependence from this hamiltonian",
    ", we change into an interaction picture with respect to @xmath101 .",
    "doing so and applying again the lamb - dicke approximation @xcite for well localised particles , we now obtain the atomic hamiltonian @xmath102 where the last term can now be written as @xmath103 the parameter @xmath104 in this equation is the laser rabi frequency , while @xmath105 is the lamb - dicke parameter and usually about one order of magnitude smaller than one .",
    "a comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ hs2 ] ) and ( [ hint2 ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ hs ] ) and ( [ hint ] ) shows that there is indeed a close analogy between the situation described here and the situation analysed in the previous section .",
    "when analysing the time evolution of the mean phonon number @xmath70 , we again find an exponential evolution @xcite .",
    "however , notice that the laser frequency @xmath100 can be chosen such that @xmath106 is many orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath107 .",
    "this means , the desired atomic transitions can become resonant with the systems dynamics .",
    "in contrast to this , the atomic transitions induced by a highly inhomogenous electric field which we described in the previous section are detuned by the atomic transition frequency @xmath107 .",
    "this is the reason why the effective heating rate @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) scales essentially as @xmath108 . for laser - induced heating processes , like the one illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , this is no longer the case .",
    "laser - induced heating can hence be much more effective than quantum optical heating due to the presence of a highly inhomogenous electric field .     and possesses exactly @xmath70 phonons , while a laser field excites the blue sideband resonantly.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    experience with ion trap experiments @xcite suggests that maximum heating rates occur , when the laser field excites the blue sideband resonantly . in other words , one should choose the laser frequency @xmath100 close to @xmath109 such that transitions which excite the atom and create a phonon become resonant and are hence the most likely transitions to occur .",
    "the dynamics of a trapped atom with laser driving on the blue sideband is illustrated in fig .",
    "there we assume again that the atom is initially in its electronic ground state @xmath38 and that there are exactly @xmath70 phonons in its vibrational mode .",
    "suppose a blue - detuned laser field excites the state @xmath110 .",
    "when followed by the spontaneous emission of a photon , the state of the system becomes @xmath111 .",
    "overall , a phonon has been gained @xcite .",
    "this paper reviews a quantum optical heating mechanism @xcite which might play an important role during the final stages of the bubble collapse phase in sonoluminescence experiments .",
    "it is shown that a weak but highly inhomogeneous electric field , as it might occur naturally during rapid bubble deformations , can increase the temperature of strongly confined particles very rapidly .",
    "the analysis of the proposed heating process in this paper and in our earlier paper ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is rather qualitative than quantitative , since it is hard to directly calculate typical values for the coupling constant @xmath64 .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath64 relates to the gradient of the inhomogenous field inside the cavitating bubble .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to determine concrete values for the heating rate @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "however , since all relevant quantities are quantum optical in nature , we assume that the described heating process can increase the mean number of phonons per trapped particle by several order of magnitude , even on a nanosecond time scale .",
    "what supports our thesis of the presence of a quantum optical heating mechanism in sonoluminescence experiments is the importance of the presence of atomic species inside the cavitating bubble .",
    "high temperatures in sonoluminescence experiments are achieved , for example , when there is a high concentration of nobel gas atoms @xcite .",
    "compared to normal atoms and ions , nobel gas atoms are unlikely to be involved in chemical reactions . however , the electronic transitions of the valence electrons of nobel gas atoms lie in the ultraviolet regime @xcite .",
    "this means , their @xmath107 is significantly larger than the typical transition frequencies @xmath107 of other particle species which lie in in the optical regime .",
    "for example , typical transition frequencies of argon atoms are above @xmath112ev , while transitions frequencies in the optical regime are below @xmath97ev @xcite . as a result",
    ", particles with transitions in the optical regime can result in higher heating rates @xmath48 ( cf .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) ) then the typical @xmath48 of a nobel gas atom .",
    "recently , it has been found that sonoluminescence experiments in ionic liquids can exhibit much higher photon emission rates than sonoluminescence experiments with nobel gas atoms @xcite .",
    "the presence of atomic transitions in the optical regime during the bubble collapse phase and the presence of trapping frequencies @xmath43 which are comparable to the trapping frequencies @xmath43 in ion trap experiments suggests that it is possible to control the temperature in sonoluminescence experiments , especially in ionic liquids , with the help of appropriately detuned laser fields .",
    "maximum rates for the atomic heating process are expected when the applied laser field excite atomic transitions close to blue sideband @xcite .",
    "these heating rates can be much larger than the heating rates @xmath48 induced by a highly inhomogenous electric field , since the relevant atomic transitions are now resonant instead of being essentially detuned by the atomic transition frequency @xmath107 .",
