    "in classical differential geometry ; a general helix in the euclidean 3-space , is a curve which makes a constant angle with a fixed direction .",
    "the notion of rectifying curve has been introduced by chen @xcite .",
    "chen showed , under which conditions , the position vector of a unit speed curve lies in its rectifying plane .",
    "he also stated the importance of rectifying curves in physics .",
    "on the other hand , the notion of slant helix was introduced by izuyama and takeuchi @xcite .",
    "they showed , under which conditions , a unit speed curve is a slant helix .",
    "later , ahmet t. ali published a paper in which position vectors of some slant helices were shown @xcite . in @xcite , l. kula ,",
    "et al studied the spherical images under both tangent and binormal indicatrices of slant helices and obtained that the spherical images of a slant helix are spherical helices .",
    "the papers mentioned above led us to study on the notion of rectifying slant helices .",
    "we began with finding the equations of curvature and torsion of a rectifying slant helix .",
    "after that , we constructed a second order linear differential equation to determine position vector of a rectifying slant helix . by solving this equation for some special cases",
    ", we obtained a unit speed family of rectifying slant helices which lie on cones .",
    "the euclidean 3-space @xmath0 is the real vector space @xmath1 with the metric @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a rectangular coordinate system of @xmath0 .",
    "a curve @xmath4 is said to be parametrized by the arclength parameter s , if @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "then , we call @xmath7 unit speed . consider unit - speed space curve @xmath7 has at least four continuous derivatives , then @xmath7 has a natural frame called frenet frame with the equations below ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the curvature , @xmath10 is the torsion , and @xmath11 is the frenet frame of the curve @xmath7 .",
    "we denote unit tangent vector field with @xmath12 , unit principal normal vector field with n , and the unit binormal vector field with @xmath13 .",
    "it is possible in general , that @xmath14 for some @xmath15 ; however , we assume that this never happens .",
    "a curve is called a slant helix if its principal normal vector field makes a constant angle with a fixed line in space .",
    "a unit speed curve @xmath7 is a slant helix if and only if the geodesic curvature of the spherical image of the principal normal indicatrix of @xmath7 which is @xmath16 is constant @xcite .",
    "a unit speed curve @xmath7 is called rectifying curve when the position vector of it always lie in its rectifying plane .",
    "so , for a rectifying curve we can write    @xmath17    a unit speed curve @xmath7 is congruent to a rectifying curve if and only if @xmath18 for some constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "if the position vector of a unit speed slant helix always lies in its rectifying plane we call it a rectifying slant helix . for a rectifying slant helix",
    "we have the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath7 be a unit speed curve in @xmath0 .",
    "then , @xmath22 is a rectifying slant helix if and only if the curvature and torsion of the curve satisfies the equations below ; @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26    let @xmath7 be a unit speed rectifying slant helix in @xmath0 , then the equations in theorem 1 , and theorem 2 exists . if we combine them then we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant .",
    "so we can write @xmath9 as follows                let @xmath7 be a unit speed rectifying slant helix whose principal normal vector field makes a constant angle with a unit vector @xmath33 , then the curvature and torsion of @xmath7 satisfy the equations below ; @xmath34 where @xmath35                                    let @xmath7 be a unit speed rectifying slant helix then we can write frenet equations as follows , @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "if we divide second equation by @xmath9 we have , @xmath54 by differentiating ( 4 ) , we have @xmath55 by differentiating ( 5 ) and using ( 3 ) we have @xmath56 n=0,\\ ] ] with the necessary calculations we easily see @xmath57 so we have ( 6 ) as follows , @xmath58 let us denote @xmath59 .",
    "then ( 7 ) becomes to @xmath60 this completes the proof .",
    "@xmath64   \\right],\\\\ & & n_2(s)=\\int\\kappa(s ) v_2(s)ds = a_2 \\left| c _ { 1 } \\right|\\sin ( \\theta ) \\sin\\left[\\sec ( \\theta ) \\arctan\\left[f(s)\\right ]   \\right],\\\\ & & n_3(s)=\\cos ( \\theta ) .",
    "\\end{matrix } \\end{matrix}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , let @xmath7 be a unit speed rectifying slant helix , whose principal normal vector field makes a constant angle @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "then , for its principal normal we can write @xmath67 while @xmath63 is a unit vector , @xmath68 .",
    "so , @xmath69",
