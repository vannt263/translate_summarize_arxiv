    "over half of gev gamma - ray sources detected by the egret experiment have not yet been identified as known astronomical objects ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , and understanding their origin is one of the most important issues in high - energy astrophysics .",
    "many of unidentified sources located in the galactic plane are believed to be associated with either of pulsars , supernova remnants , or massive stars as suggested by statistically significant correlation between unidentified egret sources and tracers of these objects ( see , e.g. , romero 2001 for a review ) .",
    "another galactic population of unidentified egret sources at intermediate galactic latitude ( @xmath6 ) has been reported by gehrels et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which are apparently associated with the gould belt , and they might be off - beam gamma - ray pulsars ( harding & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "there are also unidentified sources at even higher latitude ( @xmath7 ) , suggesting the extragalactic origin .",
    "variable sources among them are likely undetected blazars , while some stable sources might be dynamically forming or merging clusters of galaxies ( totani & kitayama 2000 ; waxman & loeb 2000 ; kawasaki & totani 2002 ) .",
    "one of the unidentified egret sources , 3eg j1835 + 5918 has been paid particular attention in recent years , since it is the brightest unidentified source outside the galactic plane ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "its gamma - ray properties , i.e. , steady flux and hard spectrum are consistent well with other gamma - ray pulsars observed by egret ( reimer et al .",
    "2001 ) , rather than blazars .",
    "no strong radio counterpart also argues against the blazar origin .",
    "intensive multi - wavelength studies of this source ( mirabal et al .",
    "2000 ; mirabal & halpern 2001 ; reimer et al .",
    "2001 ) have revealed about a dozen of x - ray sources in or around the error circle of 3eg j1835 + 5918 , and most of them are coronal emission from stars or quasars without any special or blazar - like characteristics , which are not likely the counterpart of 3eg j1835 + 5918 .",
    "then the only one unidentified x - ray source , rx j1836.2 + 5925 , remains as the most likely counterpart .",
    "it has very soft x - ray spectrum ( @xmath10k ) and has no optical counterpart down to @xmath11 ( mirabal & halpern 2001 ) giving a high x - ray / optical ratio .",
    "this and the lack of strong radio emission are reminiscent of the characteristics of isolated neutron stars or radio - quiet pulsars ( e.g. , brazier & johnston 1999 ; neuhuser & trmper 1999 ) , and this is why both mirabal & halpern ( 2001 ) and reimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that the most likely identification of 3eg j1835 + 5918 / rx j1836.2 + 5925 is an isolated radio - quiet pulsar , which is similar to the proto - type object geminga .",
    "however , with the x - ray flux of 26@xmath12 ( mirabal & halpern 2001 ) , the optical upper limit ( @xmath13 at @xmath14 ) corresponds to the x - ray / optical flux ratio of @xmath15 300 , and it is not large enough compared with the flux ratio expected for isolated pulsars or neutron stars , although all x - ray sources other than isolated neutron stars and low - mass x - ray binaries have @xmath16 ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) . here",
    "we report a deep optical imaging observation of 3eg j1835 + 5918 / rx j1836.2 + 5925 by the 8.2 m subaru telescope , to examine the proposed identification and the origin of this enigmatic source .",
    "the observation was made on july 17 , 2001 , by the subaru / focas whose field of view is a circle with @xmath17 diameter .",
    "we took images in @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands , with the total exposure time of 2400 and 6000 sec , respectively .",
    "the 5@xmath20 peak level corresponds to @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "figures [ fig : b-30x30 ] and [ fig : b-10x10 ] show the b band images centered on the position of rx j1836.2 + 5925 determined by mirabal & halpern ( 2001 ) with the error radius of @xmath23 ( j2000 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "the galactic extinction to this direction is @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) giving upper bounds on extinction in any galactic objects .",
    "the seeing size in the @xmath18 band is @xmath28 fwhm . on the other hand ,",
    "the quality of @xmath19 band image is not as good as the @xmath18 band and no object is found in the error circle ; we then set a rough upper limit of @xmath29 including systematic uncertainty of photometry .    in the @xmath18 band image we detected two extended sources which are connected with each other ( labeled as c and d in the images ) .",
    "their peak are 5.1 and 5.8@xmath20 of the sky fluctuation level , respectively .",
    "we found two point - like sources with peak levels higher than 3@xmath20 levels , which are labeled as a and b in the images .",
    "the results of photometry as well as the source locations for the above four objects are summarized in table [ table : photometry ] . in the following of this paper",
    ", we will refer to the sources c and d as one source ( c+d ) .",
    "we checked that the noise fluctuation is symmetric above and below the zero point of the background , and we did the same detection procedure for the inverted image to estimate the number of spurious objects .",
    "this indicates that sources a and b are not firm detections ; the probabilities that they are spurious detection are estimated to be @xmath30 and 30% , respectively , from the counts of spurious objects in the inverted frame .",
    "an even fainter , extended source can be seen in the bottom of the error circle , whose peak level is less than 3@xmath20 , and we do not consider this source in this letter .    if 3eg j1835 + 5918 is a pulsar with high proper motion , it might have moved to outside of the error circle determined by rosat data .",
    "therefore examination only within the rosat error circle is not sufficent .",
    "our observation is 3.5yr later than the rosat hri observation ( mirabal & halpern 2001 ) , and assuming a distance of 200pc and transverse velocity of 500km / s , the proper motion becomes @xmath31 .",
    "therefore we examined the outer region @xmath32 beyond the rosat error circle , but we found no significant sources like a  d .",
    "first we consider the possibility that c+d is an interacting galaxy .",
    "the @xmath18-band galaxy count at @xmath2 is about @xmath33 ( e.g. , totani & yoshii 2000 ) , and hence the number of galaxies expected in the error circle of rx j1836.2 + 5925 becomes @xmath340.4 , indicating that the appearance of a galaxy by chance is not surprising at all .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of rx j1836.2 + 5925 is very soft , and this argues against the possibility that the x - ray emission is coming from nuclear activity in extended faint galaxies . as mentioned earlier , the gamma - ray properties and lack of strong radio emission also disfavor the agn origin for 3eg j1835 + 5918 .",
    "the morphology of c and d suggests that they are merging or interacting galaxies , and steady radiation of gamma - rays may be possible by particle acceleration from merging shocks .",
    "however , assuming typical values of mass / light ratio of galaxies , merging velocity ( @xmath34 a few hundreds km / s ) , and interaction time scale ( @xmath35yr ) , we estimated the maximum luminosity possible from merging , as the merging kinetic energy divided by the interaction time scale .",
    "it turns out to be of order @xmath36 , and this is more than four orders of magnitude weaker than the gamma - ray flux of 3eg j1835 + 5918 , safely excluding this possibility .",
    "therefore , if the source c+d is a galaxy , it is not a counterpart of 3eg j1835 + 5918 .",
    "another possibility which should be considered here is that the extended object c+d is a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the optical @xmath37 flux is more than 5 orders of magnitude lower than the gamma - ray flux , and hence than the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar .",
    "the size of the extended objects , @xmath38 , seems small as an entire size of typical synchrotron nebulae , but observations of other pulsars or pulsar candidates have often revealed extended cores or knots with similar size around central pulsars , e.g. , optical knots in the crab pulsar ( hester et al .",
    "1995 ) or chandra observations of several crab - like young supernova remnants ( slane et al . 2000 ; hughes et al . 2001 ) .",
    "nonthermal x - ray synchrotron nebula emission is known to be correlated to the spin - down luminosity as @xmath39 ( e.g. , seward & wang 1988 ; becker & trmper 1997 ) , and the compact ( but extended ) x - ray cores have a flux of about 10% of the total nebula flux ( slane et al . 2000 ; hughes et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the optical flux of the object c+d seems small compared with these x - ray fluxes .",
    "on the other hand , the optical knots of the crab pulsar have luminosity about seven orders of magnitude lower than the spin - down luminosity , and hence the object c+d may be a similar knot embedded in a nebula which is much more extended and undetected .",
    "since the object is located at intermediate galactic latitude ( @xmath40 ) , the pulsar is likely to have a high velocity .",
    "then it is possible that the extended nebular is a bow shock where the ram pressure from interstellar matter and the pulsar wind pressure are in equilibrium : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the spin - down luminosity assumed to be the same as the wind luminosity , @xmath43 the nucleon density of ambient medium , @xmath44 the proton mass , @xmath45 the pulsar velocity , @xmath46 the distance to the pulsar , @xmath47 the ratio of gamma - ray luminosity to spin - down luminosity , @xmath48 the observed gamma - ray flux ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 the radius of the bow shock , and @xmath51 .",
    "this equation suggests a reasonable density of ambient matter as @xmath52 although it might be higher than expected for the mid galactic latitude region .",
    "we must await further multi - band optical observation to clarify whether the extended object is a galaxy or a synchrotron nebula .    in the following we assume that c+d is not related to rx j1836.2 + 5925/3eg j1835 + 5918 .",
    "the flux of possible point sources a and b sets an upper limit of @xmath53 for point sources , which is much stronger than previous limit of @xmath13 .",
    "this translates to the lower limit of @xmath3 on rx j1836.2 + 5925 .",
    "if we assume the reyleigh - jeans spectrum ( @xmath54 ) as expected for thermal emission from an isolated neutron star , the limit on the x - ray / v ratio becomes @xmath55 5300 .",
    "( however , it should also be noted that the optical spectrum of isolated neutron stars is often not entirely the black - body , as is the case for the geminga . )",
    "this limit on x - ray / optical flux ratio further strengthens the argument for the isolated neutron - star identification for rx j1836.2 + 5925 .",
    "star counts in such a faint magnitude are not well constrained , but a typical theoretical model predicts about 1000015000 stars per square degree down to @xmath56 to the direction of rx j1836.2 + 5925 , with an extreme assumption that ancient white dwarfs contribute 100% of the dark halo of our galaxy ( robin , reyl , & crze 2000 ; a. robin , private communication ) .",
    "then the expected star count in the @xmath23-radius error circle is about 0.03 stars , and hence a random coincidence of a star in the error circle of rx j1836.2 + 5925 seems to be unlikely . on the other hand",
    ", we can not reject a possibility that the point - like objects a and/or b are small galaxies which could not be resolved .",
    "keeping these caveats in mind , we assume that one of the two is a real isolated pulsar and the physical counterpart of rx j1836.2 + 5925 , and then discuss implications in this case .    to examine the physical connection between rx j1836.2 + 5925 and 3eg j1835 + 5918 , we should also estimate the chance probability of finding an isolated neutron star within the error circle of 3eg j1835 + 5918 ( @xmath57 radius ) .",
    "based on the estimations of pulsar birth rate ( e.g. , narayan & ostriker 1990 ) and supernova rate ( e.g. , totani , sato , & yoshii 1996 ) , about @xmath58 neutron stars are typically expected to exist in our galaxy .",
    "thermal emission can be observed by either cooling neutron star surfaces or those heated by accretion of interstellar matters .",
    "neuhuser & trmper ( 1999 ) compiled observational constraints on the x - ray counts of such neutron stars detectable by the rosat all sky survey , and compared them with theoretical expectations .",
    "since neutron stars rapidly cool down after @xmath59yr according to the standard cooling theory of neutron stars ( friedman & pandharipande 1981 ) , the expected count of cooling neutron stars is much smaller than that of the accreting neutron stars .",
    "the former is @xmath34 110 sr@xmath60 for rosat x - ray flux of @xmath61 , and the expected number in the 12@xmath62-radius error circle of 3eg j1835 + 5918 is found to be sufficiently small as @xmath63@xmath64 .",
    "the estimate for accreting neutron stars is rather uncertain and it could be much higher than that for cooling neutron stars , but the observational upper bound by rosat is @xmath65 1001000 sr@xmath60 again at @xmath66 , and the expected count in the egret error circle should be less than @xmath34 0.04 .",
    "it should also be noted that 3eg j1835 + 5918 is at intermediate galactic latitude .",
    "then it seems unlikely that it is heated by accretion , since the ambient gas density should not be high and the neutron star should have high - velocity proper motion .",
    "( the bondi - hoyle accretion rate scales as @xmath67 . )    now we discuss the broad - band spectral energy distribution of this source , assuming that 3eg j1835 + 5918 and rx j1836.2 + 5925 are physically associated and it is a gamma - ray pulsar . assuming the thermal flux of @xmath1 from the neutron star surface , we can derive thermal temperature and distance , by scaling from the proto - type gamma - ray pulsar geminga .",
    "the thermal x - ray spectrum of geminga can be fitted with @xmath68k ( halpern & wang 1997 ) , and its optical @xmath18-band flux ( @xmath69 , mignani , caraveo , & bignami 1998 ) is about a factor of 5.8 higher than the extrapolation from the x - ray flux .",
    "such a trend , i.e. , optical flux that is a factor of several higher than that extrapolated from x - ray temperature , has been known also for another isolated neutron star , rx j185635@xmath703754 ( walter & matthews 1997 ) . assuming this factor also for rx j1836.2 + 5925",
    ", we obtain the black - body temperature of @xmath71k from the x - ray / optical flux ratio , assuming @xmath72 . if the effective emission area of thermal radiation is the same , the optical flux in the rayleigh - jeans region scales as @xmath73 . therefore , the distance to rx j1836.2 + 5925 can be inferred as @xmath74pc , from the known distance of geminga ( @xmath75pc , caraveo et al .",

    "[ fig : sed ] , and the observed gamma - ray , x - ray and optical luminosities or upper limits are also shown by open circles or solid lines .",
    "the error bar of the soft x - ray data point ( 0.2kev ) is showing the flux change when different column densities of @xmath77 or @xmath78 are assumed , with the same temperature .",
    "the upper bound on hard x - ray flux ( @xmath791kev ) is from asca observation ( mirabal et al . 2000 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the black - body spectrum and observed luminosities of geminga in optical , soft and hard x - ray , and gamma - ray bands are shown by dashed lines or crosses .",
    "a striking similarity of the spectral energy distribution between geminga and rx j1836.2 + 5925/3eg j1835 + 5918 can be seen .",
    "the no detection of nonthermal x - rays from rx j1836.2 + 5925 is marginally consistent with the asca upper bound , if the nonthermal x - ray luminosity is similar to that of geminga . assuming the distance of 300pc and an age of the pulsar to be @xmath80yr , which is similar to that of geminga",
    ", the galactic latitude of @xmath81 implies a reasonable transverse proper motion of @xmath82 km / s",
    ".    to summarize , we found an extended source having a peculiar shape ( c+d ) at @xmath83 within the error circle of rx j1836.2 + 5925 , which has been suspected as an isolated pulsar associated with 3eg j1835 + 5918 .",
    "this source might be a pulsar nebular or knot whose luminosity is about 56 orders of magnitude lower than the gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "however , it is statistically well possible that a galaxy appeared by chance as the source c+d within the examined error circle .",
    "there are two fainter possible point sources ( a , b ) at @xmath1 , although they are not firm detections because of low signal - to - noise .",
    "it is interesting that if either of a or b is a real counter part of rx j1836.2 + 5925 and thermal emission from a neutron star , its optical , x , and gamma - ray luminosities are very similar to those of the proto - type gamma - ray pulsar geminga .",
    "the pulsar identification of geminga came from the detection of pulsation in x - ray flux , and hence it can be imagined that the ultimate identification of the enigmatic source 3eg j1835 + 5918 will also be brought by discovery of x - ray pulsation . on the other hand ,",
    "further deep optical study is also very important to verify whether the extended source c+d is a galaxy or not , to confirm the possible point sources a and/or b with higher signal - to - noise ratio , and to measure proper motion and parallax for distance determination .",
