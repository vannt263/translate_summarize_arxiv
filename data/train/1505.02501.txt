    "about two dozen supernova ( sn ) burst neutrinos were observed in the kamiokande ii , imb , and baksan experiments from stellar collapse sn 1987a when the star sanduleak -69202 exploded in the large magellanic cloud , about 50 kpc away from the earth  @xcite .",
    "besides the sun , sn 1987a remains the only known astrophysical neutrino source that has provided a large range of physical limits on neutrinos as well as the core - collapse supernova mechanism  @xcite .",
    "almost all of the gravitational binding energy of a stellar collapse is carried away by neutrinos and core - collapse supernovae are likely strong galactic sources of gravitational waves",
    ". observations of both neutrinos and gravitational waves could provide deep insight into the core collapse of supernova explosions as well as other fundamental physics  @xcite .",
    "galactic sn explosions are rare , occurring with a rate of only a few per century  @xcite , so detecting neutrinos from a nearby sn is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity . sn neutrinos are expected to arrive at the earth a few hours before the visual sn explosion , which enables an early warning for a sn observation  @xcite .",
    "the supernova early warning system ( snews )  @xcite collaborates with experiments sensitive to core collapse sn neutrinos , to provide the astronomical community with a very high - confidence early warning of a sn occurrence , pointing more powerful telescopes or facilities to the event .",
    "the antineutrino detectors ( ads ) of the daya bay experiment are designed to detect @xmath0 s via the inverse beta - decay ( ibd ) interaction @xmath1 , with the primary goal of making a precision measurement the neutrino mixing angle @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "each ad contains about 21.6  tons of liquid scintillator ( ls ) and 19.9  tons of liquid scintillator doped with gadolinium ( gd - ls ) , giving a total active target mass of @xmath3330 tons in 8 ads .",
    "the water shields ( about 2.3 kton in total ) around the ads collect too little light to efficiently detect sn burst neutrinos .",
    "a dedicated online supernova trigger system was installed in august 2013 and daya bay joined snews in november 2014 .",

    "it can not distinguish among neutrino flavors nor measure positron energy , although for a galactic sn , it can track the subtle features in the temporal development of the sn neutrino bursts @xcite .",
    "kamland , borexino , and daya bay have finer energy resolutions ( e.g. @xmath7 at 10 mev for daya bay ) and lower energy thresholds ( below the ibd reaction threshold of 1.8 mev ) , which provide sensitivity to the full spectrum of the sn burst electron - antineutrinos .",
    "daya bay has a unique feature of 8 identically - designed detectors deployed in three separate experimental halls ( ehs , fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] ) , which are @xmath8  1  km apart from each other and whose maximum overburdens in equivalent meters of water are 250 , 265 , and 860 , respectively .",
    "the online supernova trigger system at daya bay can provide an alert to the experiment and to snews within 10 seconds , since the impact from muon - induced and accidental backgrounds or abnormal noise occurring in a single - detector is minimized by the separation of detectors .",
    "daya bay has the prominent features of a prompt alert and well controlled false - alert rate .",
    "an overview of the online supernova trigger system of daya bay is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : snews_diagram ] . the system is composed of three sub - systems : online , offline , and monitoring .",

    "the offline sub - system processes the input from the online sub - system with several standalone programs running in an onsite farm .",
    "supernova candidate triggers are categorized as golden triggers ( 1 per 3 months ) or silent triggers ( 1 per month ) .",

    "the datagram is then sent to snews .",
    "an offline cross check will be performed to confirm or retract the triggers .",

    "there is a 1 hz heartbeat to the ibd selection program from the is server .",
    "if the 8 ads are not running simultaneously outside a tolerance of 2 minutes , a warning will be sent and the trigger system will continue to operate with the active ads . any abnormal running status for any level of the online supernova trigger system automatically generates an error report and mails it to experts .",

    "different experimental halls are assumed to be mutually independent and the correlation coefficient between two ads in the same hall is measured to be @xmath13 0.01 .",
    "the correlation originates from muon - induced backgrounds , mainly fast neutrons , that cause nearly simultaneous signals in detectors of the same experimental hall .",
    "the rate of occurrence for each combination is predicted using several independent poisson variables .",
    "each ad has one poisson variable for its own independent rate and every possible combination of two ads in the same hall has one poisson variable for their correlated rate .",
    "for instance , in the case of 2 ads installed in one experimental hall ( such as in eh1 and eh2 ) , three independent poisson variables are defined : @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "suppose the event count of ad1 ( ad2 ) in a 10-second window is @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , then the mean values for the three variables can be deduced from the measured mean values @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , i.e. 10  times  the  measured  @xmath38 [ hz ] , and the measured covariance @xmath39 : @xmath40 therefore , each combination @xmath41 could arise from numerous possible cases of @xmath42 and its probability obtained by summing over the possible cases : @xmath43 where @xmath44 are non - negative integers and @xmath45 , @xmath46 and po is the poisson distribution function .",

[ combine ] ) for all ads , are needed to determine the probabilities of the combinations and to set the trigger cut .",
    "the ibd candidates are mainly reactor neutrinos associated with ngd ibds of lower prompt energy ( reactor nh ibds are suppressed with the prompt energy cut ) and muon - induced fast neutrons of higher prompt energy  @xcite .    the detection probability is demonstrated for two cases : r@xmath31 = r@xmath65 and r@xmath31 = @xmath66r@xmath65 , where r@xmath65 is the ngd ibd candidate rate of the @xmath28th ad , which is estimated from  @xcite .",

    "<S> providing an early warning of galactic supernova explosions from neutrino signals is important in studying supernova dynamics and neutrino physics . a dedicated supernova trigger system has been designed and installed in the data acquisition system at daya bay and integrated into the worldwide supernova early warning system ( snews ) . </S>",
    "<S> daya bay s unique feature of eight identically - designed detectors deployed in three separate experimental halls makes the trigger system naturally robust against cosmogenic backgrounds , enabling a prompt analysis of online triggers and a tight control of the false - alert rate . </S>",
    "<S> the trigger system is estimated to be fully sensitive to 1987a - type supernova bursts throughout most of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> the significant gain in sensitivity of the eight - detector configuration over a mass - equivalent single detector is also estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the experience of this online trigger system is applicable to future projects with spatially distributed detectors .    </S>",
