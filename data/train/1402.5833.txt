    "the main motivation for the classification problem we are after is the investigation of integral expansions of the type @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a locally compact group with haar measure @xmath4 and where @xmath5 is a unitary representation of @xmath3 on some hilbert space @xmath6 , typically @xmath7 .",

    "phase space analysis strongly indicates that when @xmath10 , then , at least when geometric operations are to be encoded in the representation @xmath5 , the correct setup is @xmath11 and @xmath5 the restriction to @xmath3 of the metaplectic representation .",
    "we actually conjecture that if such a pair is reproducing , then @xmath3 is conjugate ( modulo compact factors ) to a subgroup of the ( standard ) maximal parabolic subgroup @xmath12 of the symplectic group , that is , the `` largest '' subgroup of block - lower triangular matrices .",
    "this belief is supported by the many existing and very natural examples of this nature and , of course , by no known counterexamples .",

    "we propose an intriguing picture that might be of some help in the seemingly much harder problem of the analogous classification in @xmath18 . in order to keep the presentation clean and to convey the basic idea , the notion of equivalence adopted here is conjugation by block - diagonal matrices in @xmath1 , that is , in the langlands factor @xmath19 of the standard maximal parabolic subgroup .",
    "this is the basic and most relevant conjugation , and was performed as a preliminary step in @xcite , where conjugation by any symplectic matrix is allowed , thereby giving rise to further identifications .    a general theory of reproducing semidirect products of the same sort of those that we consider here has been developed by the first two listed authors in @xcite .",

    "it is well known that the following disjoint union holds @xmath113 using the decomposition and this equality we obtain @xmath114 which implies @xmath115    note that , if @xmath116 is in the class @xmath117 , then @xmath16 is connected , so that @xmath118 . hence , in the following sections we consider only the restriction of @xmath75 to the connected component @xmath119 , whose image is @xmath120 .",
    "in order to classify the subgroups of @xmath12 that belong to @xmath13 , the strategy is as follows .",
    "we fix a vector subspace @xmath121 and determine the maximal subgroup @xmath122 of @xmath123 that leaves @xmath15 invariant under the action .",
    "then , we find all the subgroups of @xmath122 , because any such @xmath16 gives rise to a group @xmath14 in @xmath13 . for both choices , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we must of course take into account the correct notion of equivalence , namely conjugation by @xmath124 .",
    "now , by [ eq : conjugation_split ] , conjugation of a group in @xmath13 splits into the action [ eq : dag_action ] on the vector space @xmath15 and again ordinary conjugation on the group @xmath16 .",
    "thus , it is enough to select a vector space @xmath15 in each equivalence class modulo the action [ eq : dag_action ] , and then , for the same @xmath15 , pick all the possible inequivalent subgroups of @xmath122 while keeping @xmath15 fixed .",
    "therefore we must find the subgroups of @xmath122 that are not conjugate to each other by some @xmath125 for which @xmath126 .",
    "the above strategy will be implemented with the aid of two observations .",
    "the first has to do with duality .",
    "we are looking at subspaces of the three dimensional vector space @xmath65 .",
    "the nontrivial ones , lines and planes , are dual to eachother under orthogonality and this duality is compatible with the semidirect structure , namely @xmath127 to see this notice that if @xmath128 and @xmath129 , then for all @xmath130 @xmath131 thus , for each group @xmath132 there is a twin group @xmath133 . in view of this , we focus our attention on the case @xmath134 .",
    "this means that we are looking at the projective space of @xmath67 and we want to determine how many distinct points we need to consider , that is , how many orbits there are under the action [ eq : dag_action ] .",
    "the second observation is that we can use geometry and carry all the above reasoning over to @xmath71 where the action [ eq : dag_action ] has become the standard action of @xmath135 .",
    "hence the selection of inequivalent vector subspaces is tantamount to finding orbit representatives of the linear action of @xmath135 .",
    "the group @xmath136 acts on @xmath71 and has exactly six orbits , including the trivial one .",
    "borrowing the terminology from physics , they are : the present event @xmath137 , the future ( @xmath138 ) , the past ( @xmath139 ) , the future and the past light cone ( @xmath140 or @xmath141 ) , the absolute elsewhere ( @xmath142).since we are looking at the projective spaces , it is enough to select a point in the upper sheet of the hyperboloid of two sheets ( @xmath143 ) , one point at latitude one in the cone ( @xmath144 ) and one point in the hyperboloid of one sheet ( @xmath145 ) .        for @xmath146",

    ", we have @xmath151 the choices that follow are convenient for computations because they take into account the iwasawa decomposition : @xmath152 indeed , if we denote as usual by @xmath50 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 the iwasawa factors of @xmath84 in [ iwasawa_decomposition ] , then it is immediate to check that @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "notice that @xmath156 , but of course the constant is irrelevant .",
    "in this section we calculate the subgroups @xmath157 and pull them back to @xmath0 via @xmath75 . after that",
    ", we determine their duals . to this end , use the iwasawa decomposition , either in the form @xmath158 or @xmath159 .",
    "if @xmath160 and @xmath161 are aligned for some @xmath162 , then they must coincide , whereas @xmath163 implies @xmath164 .",
    "therefore @xmath165 where subscripts indicate stabilizers .",
    "neither of the above circumstances occurs for @xmath166 .",
    "now let @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",
    "as @xmath102 stabilizes @xmath169 , we have @xmath170 .",
    "further , @xmath101 moves @xmath169 along hyperbolae and @xmath50 along parabolae .",
    "hence @xmath171 implies @xmath172 , the identity of the group .",
    "this implies @xmath173 , so that @xmath174 .    since @xmath101 stabilizes @xmath175 , @xmath176",
    "this time @xmath50 rules the hyperboloid of one sheet , so @xmath177 implies @xmath178 .",
    "thus @xmath179 and this is only possible if @xmath180 is either the identity or the spatial reflection @xmath181 hence @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",

    "the subgroup @xmath102 is not in @xmath187 since it rotates the point away from its projective orbit .",
    "hence @xmath188 .",
    "therefore @xmath189    it is now very easy to realize these groups in @xmath190 , because the inverse image of each component is well known : @xmath191 for simplicity , we shall write @xmath192 for @xmath193 .    finally , we compute the maximal groups arising from planes . in view of [ eq : dual_group ]",

    "as explained earlier , the groups we are after are the semidirect products of @xmath199 with connected subgroups of @xmath192 , thus we must find the latter ones .",
    "a natural approach is to look at the lie algebra of @xmath192 and determine all the lie subalgebras . in the end , exponentiation will give us the connected subgroups .",

    "some of these points are conjugated .",
    "indeed , take @xmath228 , hence @xmath229 the conjugation effect on the fat cell is an affine transformation , namely @xmath230 h^{-1 } = [ \\lambda:\\frac{a}{c}\\mu -\\frac{b}{a}:1],\\ ] ] so that every element in that cell can by conjugated to @xmath231 $ ] .",

    "let us first determine a cell decomposition .",
