    "in the framework of quantum information theory , mixed @xmath1-qubit x - states synthesize a family of quantum states whose inherent correlations are much easier to quantify than is generally the case .",

    "owing to this sparse structure , that includes important states ( e.g. , bell s  @xcite , werner s  @xcite , isotropic  @xcite , ghz  @xcite , etc . ) , _ analytical _ investigations of entanglement properties@xcite and quantum discord  @xcite in @xmath1-qubit x - states have lately become an active and fruitful field of research .",
    "retrospectively , important members of the class of two - qubit x - states were identified in  @xcite , where the concept of maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) was introduced and characterized . from these seminal works , worthy of note is the observation that two - qubit states of a fixed spectrum and maximal entanglement ( as measured by concurrence , negativity or relative entropy of entanglement ) can always be found in the x - form .",

    "little has been accomplished in extending the characterization of mems beyond two - qubits .",
    "largely , this is because sensible measures of _ genuine multipartite _ entanglement have been identified only recently  @xcite and are generally hard to evaluate , let alone maximize .    a first important step toward the identification of @xmath1-qubit mems for @xmath2",

    "et al_.  @xcite , who showed that the gm - concurrence of @xmath1-qubit _ x - states _ admits a simple closed formula , amenable to maximization .",
    "although the resulting optimal states of this maximization can not be guaranteed to be actual mems , at least they are provably mems amongst all @xmath1-qubit x - states .",
    "therefore , in  @xcite , agarwal and hashemi rafsanjani maximized the x - state gm - concurrence formula under the constraint of a fixed linear entropy , determining the so - called x - mems .    in this paper",
    ", we enlarge the scope of the term x - mems to enclose two classes of x - states : _ x - mems with respect to _ ( wrt ) _ spectrum _ , referring to those @xmath1-qubit x - states of maximal gm - concurrence for a fixed spectrum , in analogy to the original mems introduced in  @xcite ; and _ x - mems wrt purity _ , referring to @xmath1-qubit x - states that maximize the gm - concurrence for a fixed value of purity , in parallel with  @xcite .",
    "our main results initially consist of : ( i ) a complete characterization of x - mems wrt spectrum , and ( ii ) a demonstration that x - mems wrt purity can be obtained from the solution of a semidefinite program ( sdp )  @xcite , by which means ( iii ) we provide an alternative proof of optimality of the states obtained in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , ( iv ) we characterize the unitary transformation that maximizes the x - state gm - concurrence formula of an arbitrary @xmath1-qubit state , generalizing the result of  @xcite for @xmath3 . finally , of independent interest",

    "note that definition  [ def : biseppure ] implies that a biseparable state is not necessarily separable , as there might be entanglement within @xmath36 and/or @xmath37 .",

    "finally , it is interesting that for ghz - diagonal states ( x - states with @xmath59 ) , the value of gm - concurrence is proportional to the distance of the ghz - state to the set of biseparable states  @xcite .",

    "an immediate remark is that , as expected , both the optimal gm - concurrence  ( [ eq : cgmoptimal ] ) and the unitary transformation ( [ eq : globalunitary ] ) reduce to the corresponding expressions in  ( * ? ? ? *",
    "theorem 1 ) when @xmath3 .",
    "the remainder of this section is devoted to proving the theorem for @xmath2 .",
    "essentially , our proof consists of a direct maximization of the gm - concurrence formula of @xmath1-qubit x - states under the constraint of a fixed spectrum .",
    "let @xmath75 denote a generic @xmath1-qubit x - density matrix of spectrum @xmath76 .",

    "let us first consider the optimization over @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "although these variables are constrained by ( [ eq : normandpsd ] ) and related to @xmath88 by ( [ eq : eigslambdak ] ) , we will momentarily ignore these contraints . by doing so",
    ", we significantly simplify the optimization procedure at the expense of risking over - maximization @xmath55 .",
    "nevertheless , as we will soon demonstrate , the resulting maximal is actually attainable , meaning that our simplifying assumptions are harmless . with that in mind",
    "we set , for every @xmath92 $ ] , @xmath93 which clearly maximizes ( [ eq : eigscgenqubitxstate ] ) over @xmath94 and @xmath90 .    at this point , we are left with the maximization over @xmath88 , written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 are the eigenvalues of the arbitrary ( but given ) @xmath1-qubit density matrix @xmath63 and the vectors @xmath97 are given by @xmath98 here , we aim to assign to each variable in @xmath88 an eigenvalue of @xmath63 , in such a way that @xmath99 is maximal and @xmath100 is minimal .",
    "to maximize @xmath99 , we simply assign to it the largest eigenvalue of @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath101 to minimize @xmath100 , first notice that @xmath102 and @xmath103 display the same entries in the reversed order , with @xmath104 occupying the central position in both vectors .",
    "it follows from the rearrangement inequality  ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 368 , page 261 ) ) that the scalar product between two vectors defined up to the ordering of their entries is minimized if and only if they are sorted in opposite directions .",
    "so , we make the entries of @xmath102 and @xmath103 monotonically increasing and decreasing , respectively , by assigning , for every @xmath92 $ ] , @xmath105    substituting the identities  ( [ eq : rjd1 ] ) , ( [ eq : lambda1peqlambda1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ansatzdistrib ] ) in ( [ eq : mixabreigs ] ) and solving the resulting system for @xmath106 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( under the constraints described in ( [ eq : normandpsd ] ) ) , we obtain that and @xmath107 indicated in ( [ eq : solsystem ] ) for any @xmath92 $ ] .",

    "finally , let us establish ( [ eq : globalunitary ] ) . since @xmath63 and @xmath64 are isospectral , we can write @xmath111 where @xmath70 is the matrix of the eigenvectors of @xmath63 and @xmath112 is the matrix of the eigenvectors of @xmath64 given by ( [ eq : rhoxprime ] ) .",
    "some simple linear algebra shows that , for @xmath113 $ ] , the matrix @xmath112 admits the block decomposition specified in ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "thus , combining the two identities in ( [ eq : rhoandrhoprime ] ) to eliminate @xmath60 , we arrive at @xmath114 \\bm{\\phi}^\\dagger\\,.\\ ] ] as noted before , the x - mems of ( [ eq : rhoxprime ] ) are unique up to lu - transformations , for which reason , in ( [ eq : globalunitary ] ) , the expression of @xmath66 appears pre - multiplied by an arbitrary lu - transformation .",
    "furthermore , for sake of generality , we have also multiplied an arbitrary ( generally non - local ) diagonal unitary matrix @xmath69 in ( [ eq : globalunitary ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized , though , that @xmath69 has obviously no effect on the output state @xmath64 .",
    "let us conclude this section by answering a central question that arises from the present work : are @xmath1-qubit x - mems actual @xmath1-qubit mems ?",
    "although this is long known to be the case for @xmath3  @xcite , indications that the same may also hold for @xmath115 have only recently appeared in the work of hedemann  @xcite .",
    "alas , to the best of our knowledge , the topic seems to be utterly unexplored for @xmath116 . to see that that conjecture can not hold in general ,",
    "note that an affirmative answer ( combined with ( [ eq : cgmoptimal ] ) ) , would imply that @xmath1-qubit density matrices whose eigenvalues @xmath61 satisfy @xmath117 can not acquire gm - entanglement by means of a global unitary transformation .",
    "however , as recently shown by huber _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xmath1-qubit thermal states of arbitrarily high temperatures and @xmath1 sufficiently large ( represented , in the computational basis , by diagonal density matrices arbitrarily close to the identity , hence fulfilling ( [ eq : sfs ] ) ) _ can _ acquire gm - entanglement by means of rotations to dicke - like ( non - x ) states , thus providing a counter - example to the original conjecture .",
    "since the purity of a given quantum state can be expressed as the sum of the squares of their eigenvalues , there are , in general , many spectra that realize a fixed value of purity @xmath4 . in this section ,",
    "we consider the problem of searching for a maximizer of the @xmath1-qubit x - state gm - concurrence formula amongst all @xmath1-qubit spectra that realize @xmath4 .",

    "since purity is determined by the spectrum ( and not the other way around ) , the specification of a spectrum generally represents a stronger constraint than a specification of purity . as a result ,",
    "if @xmath118 is a _ x - mems wrt purity @xmath4 _ and has spectrum @xmath127 , then @xmath118 is also a _ x - mems wrt to the spectrum @xmath127_. in other words , every x - mems wrt purity can be regarded as a x - mems wrt _ some _ spectrum , in which case every @xmath118 is of the form ( [ eq : rhoxprime ] ) up to a lu - transformation .",
    "thanks to this , we can determine @xmath118 by maximizing the gm - concurrence of ( [ eq : rhoxprime ] ) over all sets of physical eigenvalues that realize @xmath4 , which yields the optimization problem represents the set of optimization variables , as opposed to a fixed set of eigenvalues ( as it was the case in sec .",

    "that is because , to arrive at problem ( [ eq : optprblm4 ] ) , we removed the summand @xmath136 from the objective function of ( [ eq : sdpopennotation ] ) ( and used the property @xmath137 to replace the maximization with the minimization ) . as a result ,",
