    "rook polynomials provide a method of enumerating permutations with restricted position . their study was begun in 1946 by kaplansky and riordan  @xcite , with applications to card - matching problems .",
    "riordan s 1958 book  @xcite is considered the first systematic analysis , and remains a classic treatment of the subject . a series of papers by goldman et al .",
    "@xcite in the 1970s expanded the field by applying more advanced combinatorial methods .",
    "more recently , haglund @xcite has made investigation into various connections of rook polynomials to other parts of mathematics : hypergeometric series , enumeration of matrices over finite fields , and group representation theory .",
    "rook polynomials are also closely related to matching theory , chromatic theory and various other graph - theoretic topics ( for example , @xcite . )",
    "applications to quantum mechanics have recently begun to surface , through the use of rook polynomials with weyl algebras @xcite . in combinatorics proper , rook polynomials",
    "have been related to various permutation statistics @xcite , and the inverse problem has been solved for ferrers boards @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that the rook polynomial of any board can be computed recursively . in this paper , we present a new block decomposition algorithm for computing rook polynomials .",
    "this is a fundamental generalization of riordan s cell decomposition @xcite , and in general improves on its efficiency .",
    "let @xmath0 be a generalized chessboard  a set of cells arranged in rows and columns .",
    "the rook is a chess piece which attacks on rows and columns ; by a rook placement we shall mean a non - attacking placement of @xmath1 indistinguishable rooks on the board @xmath0 .",
    "this intuitive definition can be formalized in several ways .",
    "a board @xmath0 may be regarded as a subset of @xmath2\\times [ 1,2,\\ldots , n]$ ] for some @xmath3 .",
    "a rook placement on @xmath0 then corresponds to a choice of @xmath1 elements of @xmath0 , @xmath4 such that @xmath5 or @xmath6 implies @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , let @xmath8 $ ] be an arbitrary subset .",
    "then a rook placement is an injective function @xmath9 $ ] such that , for any @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath0 may also be seen as an element of @xmath12 $ ] , an @xmath13 matrix with binary entries .",
    "we write in this case @xmath14 . in this interpretation",
    ", a placement of @xmath1 rooks on @xmath0 corresponds to a choice of @xmath1 independent 1 s in @xmath0 .",
    "a third formalization is to regard @xmath0 as a bipartite graph on vertex sets @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] , where the graph contains edge @xmath17 iff @xmath17 is a cell in the corresponding chessboard .",
    "a rook placement then corresponds to a partial matching on the graph .",
    "the rook polynomial of a board @xmath0 is the ordinary generating function @xmath18 where the coefficient @xmath19 is the number of placements of @xmath1 rooks on @xmath0 . where its omission will cause no confusion",
    ", we will assume the variable to be @xmath20 , and will simply write @xmath21 .",
    "rook polynomials were first investigated by kaplansky and riordan @xcite in the 1940 s .",
    "the following preliminary results and observations , which we shall state here without proof , are theirs ; proofs can be found in @xcite .",
    "two boards @xmath22 , @xmath0 are said to be disjoint if no cell of @xmath0 is in the same row or column as any cell of @xmath22 .",
    "[ dbt ] in this case , it is clear that the number of ways of placing @xmath1 rooks on a board consisting of the disjoint union @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are coefficients in the rook polynomials of @xmath22 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "then the rook polynomial of @xmath23 is @xmath27    [ rbt ] the rook polynomial of a rectangular @xmath13 board , denoted @xmath28 or simply @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30    two boards @xmath22,@xmath0 are said to be rook equivalent if @xmath31 .",
    "a sufficient condition for rook equivalence is that @xmath0 can be obtained from @xmath22 by permutation of rows and columns .",
    "( this condition is not necessary , as demonstrated by the two boards in figure  [ equivalent - boards ] . )    .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    riordan @xcite also gives an algorithm which allows the rook polynomial of any board to be computed recursively .",
    "[ cdt ] let @xmath0 be a board , and @xmath32 be a cell of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the board obtained from @xmath0 by deleting cell @xmath32 , and let @xmath34 denote the board obtained from @xmath0 by deleting row @xmath35 and column @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath37    this decomposition theorem provides a recursive method for calculating the rook polynomial of any board . in the next section",
    ", we present a generalization of this algorithm , which allows more efficient computation .",
    "in this section , we shall view a board formally as an @xmath13 matrix over @xmath38 .",
    "a subboard @xmath39 of a board @xmath0 is a set of cells of @xmath0 , inheriting the row and column relationships of @xmath0 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath39 is , up to permutation of rows and columns , a submatrix of @xmath0 .",
    "more formally , @xmath39 is represented by a matrix @xmath40 over @xmath38 , together with injective mappings @xmath41 and @xmath42 from the row and column indices of @xmath39 to those of @xmath0 , having the property that @xmath43 .",
    "a subboard @xmath39 of @xmath0 is said to cover a row @xmath35 of @xmath0 ( respectively a column @xmath36 ) if @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) is contained in the image of @xmath41 ( resp .",
    "@xmath42 . )",
    "a block @xmath39 in @xmath0 is a subboard of @xmath0 satisfying the following conditions :    1 .   for any rows @xmath44 covered by @xmath39 , and any column @xmath36 not covered by @xmath39 , @xmath45 .",
    "2 .   for any row @xmath35 not covered by @xmath39 , and any columns @xmath46 covered by @xmath39 , @xmath47 .    intuitively , an @xmath48 block @xmath39 is a subboard of @xmath0 formed at the intersection of a set of @xmath49 rows with a set of @xmath50 columns , all of which are identical except perhaps on @xmath39 .",
    "( note that every cell of @xmath0 is trivially a 1@xmath511 block . )",
    "let @xmath0 be an @xmath13 board , and @xmath39 an @xmath48 block in @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath52 , let @xmath53 denote the board obtained from @xmath0 by deleting    1 .",
    "@xmath36 of the @xmath49 rows covered by @xmath39 2 .",
    "@xmath36 of the @xmath50 columns covered by @xmath39 3 .",
    "all the cells of @xmath39    @xmath53 is called the @xmath54 inclusion board of @xmath0 relative to @xmath39 .",
    "note that this is well - defined , since the rows and columns involved are identical except on @xmath39 , which is also deleted .",
    "the following theorem is a generalization of riordan s cell decomposition , theorem  [ cdt ] .",
    "[ bdt ] let @xmath0 be an @xmath13 board , and @xmath39 an @xmath48 block in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath55 be the coefficient of @xmath56 in the rook polynomial of @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the @xmath57 inclusion board of @xmath0 relative to @xmath39 , for @xmath58",
    ". then @xmath59    consider all the @xmath19 possible placements of @xmath1 rooks on @xmath0 .",
    "these may be partitioned into @xmath60 classes , according to the number of rooks placed on @xmath39 .",
    "rook placements which include @xmath36 rooks on @xmath39 are exactly those enumerated by the @xmath57 inclusion board @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the number of placements of @xmath1 rooks on @xmath0 is @xmath61.\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath62",
    "as noted above , any cell @xmath32 of @xmath0 is a @xmath63 block . by theorem  [ rbt ] ,",
    "its rook polynomial is @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , theorem  [ bdt ] gives @xmath65    @xmath66 and @xmath67 are exactly the exclusion and inclusion boards @xmath33 and @xmath34 defined by riordan ( as given in theorem  [ cdt ] ) , so that in the case of a @xmath63 block , this decomposition agrees with riordan s cell decomposition .",
    "since @xmath63 is the smallest block possible , and since such a block always exists , this block decomposition algorithm will always be at least as fast as riordan s cell decomposition .",
    "efficiency of either algorithm is greatly affected by the choice of cell / block by which to decompose , as shown in the next few examples .",
    "consider the right - triangular board shown below .",
    "the decompositions given below both result from @xmath68 blocks : there are four such blocks to choose from . as shown below , a wise choice will immediately reduce the number of subsequent iterations needed by providing more nearly - rectangular boards , and therefore larger blocks available in the next iterations .",
    "note that we have decomposed 12 cells with one iteration , expressing the desired rook polynomial in terms of four simpler boards .",
    "the cell decomposition method of theorem[cdt ] would have required 12 iterations to achieve the same thing , and the resulting expression would have involved @xmath70 boards !    from the preceding example , it is tempting to conjecture that the optimal solution is to use the largest block possible .",
    "however , this is not always the best strategy , as illustrated by the next example .",
    "there are five maximal blocks here : a @xmath71 and a @xmath72 in the upper left , a @xmath73 and a @xmath72 in the lower right , and the @xmath73 block in the upper right .",
    "the largest is the @xmath72 ; decomposing by this gives          all of these are disjoint unions of rectangular boards ; therefore , by remark  [ dbt ] , @xmath74 = r_{5,6}r_{4,8}+5xr_{4,6}r_{4,7}+5x^2r_{3,6}r_{4,6},\\ ] ] all of which are immediately given by theorem  [ rbt ] .",
    "therefore , in this example decomposing by the largest available block was _ not _ the most direct route to a solution .",
    "the question of how to make optimal block choices is a complicated one , and deserves further investigation ."
