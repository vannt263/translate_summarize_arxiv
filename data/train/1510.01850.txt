    "work is currently in progress to upgrade the cylindrical ooty radio telescope ( ort ) ) so that it functions as a linear interferometric array the ooty wide field array ( owfa ; prasad & subrahmanya 2011a , b ; ram marthi & chengalur 2014 ) .",
    "this telescope operates at a nominal frequency of @xmath9 which corresponds to the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) @xmath10 radiation from a redshift @xmath11 .",
    "observations of the fluctuations in the contribution from the hi to the diffuse background radiation are a very interesting probe of the large - scale structures in the high-@xmath12 universe ( bharadwaj , nath & sethi 2001,bharadwaj , & sethi 2001 ) .",
    "in addition to the power spectrum ( bharadwaj & pandey 2003 , bharadwaj & srikant 2004 ) this is also a sensitive probe of the bispectrum ( ali , bharadwaj and pandey 2006 , guha sarkar & hazra 2013 ) .",
    "there has been a continued , growing interest towards the detection of the 21 cm signal from the lower redshifts @xmath13 to probe the post - reionization era ( chang et al .",

    "recently , ali & bharadwaj ( 2014 ) ( henceforth , paper i ) have studied the prospects for detecting the hi signal from redshift @xmath11 using owfa .",
    "the owfa provides an unique opportunity to study the large scale structures at @xmath11 .    a number of similar upcoming packed radio interferometer ( chime , bandura et al .",
    "2014 ; baobab and the kzn array ) have been proposed to probe the expansion history of the low - redshift universe ( @xmath14 ) with an unprecedented precision using bao measurements from the large - scale hi fluctuations .",
    "even more innovative designs are being planned for the future low frequency telescope ska .",
    "this promises to yield highly significant measurements of the hi power spectrum over a large redshift range spanning nearly the entire post - reionization era @xmath15 .",
    "however , the detection of the faint @xmath16 hi signal ( @xmath17 ) is extremely challenging due to the presence of different astrophysical foregrounds .",
    "the foregrounds are four to five orders of magnitude brighter than the post - reionization hi signal ( ghosh et al .",
    "2011a,2011b ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have considered the visibility correlation ( bharadwaj , & sethi 2001 , bharadwaj , & ali 2005 ) which essentially is the data covariance matrix that is necessary to calculate the fisher matrix .",
    "we have employed the fisher matrix technique to predict the expected signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) for detecting the hi signal . in our analysis",
    "we have assumed that the hi traces the total matter with a linear bias , and the matter power spectrum is precisely as predicted by the standard lcdm model with the parameter values mentioned later .",
    "the hi power spectrum is then completely specified by two parameters @xmath4 , which sets the overall amplitude of the power spectrum , and @xmath7 the redshift distortion parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 here is the product of the mean neutral hydrogen fraction ( @xmath18 ) and the linear bias parameter ( @xmath19 ) . for a detection , we focus on measuring the amplitude @xmath4 , marginalizing over @xmath7 .",
    "we also consider the joint estimation of @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "our entire analysis is based on the assumption that the visibility data contains only the signal and the noise , and the foregrounds and radio - frequency interference have been completely removed from the data .",
    "the bao feature is within the baseline range covered by owfa ( paper i ) .",
    "however , the frequency coverage ( @xmath20 ) is rather small .",
    "further , for the present analysis we have only considered observations in a single field of view .",
    "all of these result in having very few fourier modes across the @xmath21 range relevant for the bao , and we do not consider this here .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly discusses some relevant system parameters for owfa . in section 3 , we present the theoretical model for calculating the signal and noise covariance , and predict their respective contributions . here",
    "we also estimate the range of k - modes which are probed by the owfa . in section 4",
    "we use the fisher matrix analysis to make predictions for the snr as a function of the observing time .",
    "finally , we present summary and conclusions in section 5 .    in this paper , we have used the ( planck @xmath22 wmap ) best - fit @xmath23cdm cosmology with cosmological parameters ( ade et al .",
    "2013 ) : @xmath24 .",
    "we have used the matter transfer function from the fitting formula of eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) incorporating the effect of baryonic features .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we find ( figure [ fig : snr ] ) that for small observing times @xmath25 , where the visibilities are dominated by the system noise , the conditional and the marginalized snr both increase as @xmath26 .",
    "the increase in the snr is slower for larger observing times , and it is expected to subsequently saturate at a limiting value which is set by the cosmic variance for very large observing times not shown here .",
    "we see ( table [ tab : error ] ) that @xmath27 of observation are needed for a @xmath3 detection with phase i. the corresponding observing time for phase ii falls drastically to @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the conditional and the marginalized cases respectively . for phase",
    "ii , the hi signal is largely dominated by the low wave numbers @xmath30 ( discussed later ) .",
    "phase i which has a larger antenna spacing and smaller frequency bandwidth does not cover many of the low @xmath21 modes which dominate the signal contribution for phase ii .",
    "the required observing times are @xmath31 and @xmath32 of those for phase ii for phases iii and iv respectively .",
    "the marginalized snr are somewhat smaller than the conditional ones , the difference however is not very large . the required observing time does not differ very much except for phase ii where it increases from @xmath28 to @xmath29 for a @xmath3 detection .",
    ".2 cm [ c][c][0.8][0]@xmath33 [ c][c][0.8][0]@xmath34    we have considered the joint estimation of the two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath7 using owfa . figure [ fig : contour ] shows the expected @xmath35 confidence intervals for @xmath36 and @xmath37 with three different observing times ( 630 , 1600 and 4000 hr ) for phases ii , iii and iv . for phase ii , a joint estimation of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath7 is possible with 15% and 60% errors respectively using 1600 hr of observation .",
    "the errors on the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath7 for 4000 hr are @xmath38 times smaller as compared to 1600 hr .",
    "the constraints are more tight in case of phases iii and iv .",

    "we have seen that the fourier modes @xmath21 sampled by owfa are predominantly in the range @xmath45 , and there are relatively few modes in the range @xmath46 ( figure [ fig : pkhi2 ] ) .",
    "however , the hi signal ( figure [ fig : convo1 ] ) is much stronger at the smaller modes , whereas the larger modes have a weaker hi signal and are dominated by the noise .",
    "it is therefore not evident as to which @xmath21 range contributes the most to the owfa hi signal detection .",
    "figure [ fig : pkbin ] shows the relative contributions to the fisher matrix from the different @xmath21 modes .",
    "we see that for @xmath47 , which corresponds to a @xmath3 detection , the bulk of the contribution is from the range @xmath48 .",
    "the larger modes do not contribute much to the signal .",
    "we have also considered @xmath49 .",
    "here we have a slightly larger range @xmath2 and the contribution peaks around @xmath50 . in a nutshell , the owfa hi signal is predominantly from the @xmath21 range @xmath51 . the larger modes ,",
    "though abundant , do not contribute much to the hi signal .",
    "we have considered four different phases of ofwa , and studied the prospects of detecting the redshifted 21-cm hi signal at @xmath52 which corresponds to redshift @xmath0 .",
    "phases i and ii are currently under development and are expected to be functional in the near future .",
    "phases iii and iv are two hypothetical configurations which have been considered as possible future expansions . we have used the fisher matrix analysis to predict the accuracy with which it will be possible to estimate the two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath7 using owfa . here @xmath4 is the amplitude of the 21-cm brightness temperature power spectrum and @xmath7 is the linear redshift space distortion parameter . for the purpose of this work",
    "we make the most optimistic assumption that the foreground contributions are not changing across different frequency channels , and hence they only contribute to the @xmath53 mode . in reality",
    "the foreground contamination will extend to other modes also .",
    "further , the chromatic response of the interferometer , calibration errors , systematics in the receivers and radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) have not been considered in the paper .",
    "focusing first on just detecting the hi signal , we have marginalized @xmath7 and considered the error estimates on @xmath4 alone .",
    "we find that a @xmath3 detection of the hi signal is possible with @xmath54 and @xmath29 of observation for phases i and ii respectively .",
    "the observing time is reduced by factor @xmath31 and @xmath32 compared to phase ii for phases iii and iv respectively .",
    "we find that there is a significant improvement in the prospects of a detection using phase ii as compared to phase i , and we have mainly considered phase ii for much of the discussion in the paper .",
    "we have also considered the joint estimation of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath7 . for phase ii , a joint estimation of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath7 is possible with 15% and 60% errors respectively using 1600 hr of observation . to estimate @xmath7",
    "it is necessary to sample fourier modes @xmath8 of a fixed magnitude @xmath21 which are oriented at different directions to the line of sight . in other words",
    ", @xmath55 should uniformly span the entire range @xmath56 .",
    "however , the @xmath57 values are much larger than @xmath58 , and the fourier modes are largely concentrated around @xmath59 , for phase ii ( section [ sec : vc ] ) .",
    "the restriction arises from the limited owfa frequency bandwidth ( table  [ tab : array ] ) which is restricted by the anti - aliasing filter .",
    "multi - field observations and larger bandwidth ( @xmath60 of the owfa hold the potential to probe of the expansion history and constrain cosmological parameters using bao measurements from the large - scale hi fluctuations at @xmath0 .",
    "anisotropies in the clustering pattern in redshifted 21-cm maps at this redshift produced by alcock - paczyski effect has the possibility of probing cosmology and structure formation .",
    "it is also possible to constrain neutrino masses of using owfa and compare among different fields of cosmology ( lss , cmbr , bbn ) .",
    "thus the owfa could provide highly complementary constraints on neutrino masses .",
    "we leave investigation of such issues for future studies .",
    "the present work has assumed that the shape of the hi power spectrum is exactly determined by the @xmath23cdm model , and has only focused estimating the overall amplitude @xmath4 from owfa observations .",

    "it is possible to use owfa observations to estimate @xmath62 in several separate bins over this @xmath21 range , without assuming the anything about the shape of the hi power spectrum . in a forthcoming paper ,",
