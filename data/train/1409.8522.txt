    "a functional material , such as a solid - state catalyst , is in general very different from the pristine material which is initially introduced into the reactive environment .",
    "after a so called `` induction period '' , nanostructures of various shapes and compositions , point defects , extended defects such as steps , dislocations , and stacking faults , can result from and will be modified by interaction of the surface of the catalyst with the reactive environment .",
    "therefore , for a functional material design , it is crucial to reliably predict stoichiometry and structure of the material under realistic conditions .",
    "however , the compositional and structural degrees of freedom at the material - gas interface result in an enormous ( combinatorial ) increase of the configurational space . materials at nanoscale size show unusual properties , that have prompted extensive studies of clusters @xcite and that are generally attributed to the presence of undercoordinated atoms . however , in the presence of a reactive atmosphere , clusters can adsorb species from the gas phase , changing their stoichiometry . under certain conditions this new state ,",
    "not the initial cluster , can become the active ( functional ) material .",
    "thus , in order to understand the functional properties of clusters in a reactive atmosphere , it is important to know which structures and stoichiometries are energetically accessible . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a robust first - principles methodology for the determination of ( meta)stable structures at realistic environmental conditions .",
    "in particular , we address the problem of validation of methods for global structure optimization .",
    "no existing method provides criteria for identifying a local minimum on a potential - energy surface as a global one .",
    "we show how this problem can be addressed , and describe a methodology for selecting a structure optimization scheme that is more likely to find the global energy minimum for a given system with less iterations .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows .",
    "the first step is an extensive and efficient scanning of the potential - energy surface ( pes ) by global structure optimization ; subsequently , the influence of the experimental conditions ( here , temperature and pressure of a reactive atmosphere ) is included . as model system ,",
    "we study gas - phase mg@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters , where @xmath2 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for results on this system at other values of @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 is the composition which minimizes the cluster free energy at given environmental conditions . up to now , different methodologies for global structure optimization and levels of theory for the inter - atomic interactions have been employed to study only stoichiometric , ( mgo)@xmath0 , clusters",
    ". @xcite the previous studies employed _ ab initio _ or empirical potentials for the evaluation of the total and relative energies .",
    "both approaches have certain advantages and drawbacks .",
    "calculations based on empirical potential or force fields are computationally cheap and fast enough to thoroughly scan the pes , but results greatly depend upon the choice of the parameters used@xcite ( see our analysis and discussion below ) .",
    "in contrast , _ ab initio _ calculations entail a fully quantum - mechanical description of the chemical bonding and of bond breaking / forming .",
    "thus , _ ab initio _ calculations are generally more accurate .",
    "however they are computationally expensive and the accuracy of the results depends on the exchange - correlation functional@xcite , which must be approximated .",
    "this approximation must be validated against higher - level methods .",
    "as it will become clear along the paper , the model system that we chose is representative of a class of systems for which very accurate evaluation of the potential - energy surface ( pes ) is mandatory for meaningful predictions ( for instance , we will demonstrate that hybrid exchange - correlation functionals are required ) .",
    "since high - accuracy calculations are computationally very expensive , a scheme for an efficient scanning of the pes is necessary in order to avoid wasting time with high - accuracy calculations in uninteresting regions of the configurational phase space .",
    "the first step of our methodology , i.e. , the pes scanning , was chosen to be performed via a massive - parallel cascade genetic algorithm ( cga ) .",
    "in such global scan , we look for the set of coordinates ( geometrical structure ) _ as well as spins _ that minimize the total energy of the cluster .",
    "an alternative scheme , where parallel searches at fixed spins are performed is discussed in section [ sec : spin ] .",
    "the term  cascade \" is used because the global - optimization is designed as a multi - step procedure involving increasing levels of accuracy for the evaluation of the globally - optimized quantity , which , in our case , is total energy .    in section [ pgs ]",
    "we introduce our cga scheme .",
    "the method is not unique , as many choices are possible at every sub - step of its implementation .",
    "therefore , we propose a validation scheme for the identification of those crucial parameters that need a careful tuning in order to achieve an efficient and accurate estimate of the desired quantities ( e.g. , structure and energy of the global minimum at each cluster size ) .",
    "the details of this validation , which constitute the core message of this paper , are described in sections [ ga - remd ] and [ comp - funct ] .    as second step ,",
    "the structures found via the cga are post - processed by applying the concepts of _ ab initio _",
    "atomistic thermodynamics ( _ _ ai__at ) @xcite in order to analyze the @xmath5 dependence of the stable compositions and structures of the various sizes @xmath3 of the mg@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters in the oxygen atmosphere .",
    "a first - principles description of the environmental effects on materials has been previously developed and appplied extendively for predicting the relative stabilities of different phases in bulk semiconductors and surface of semiconfductors and oxides.@xcite in section [ sec : aiat ] we present a self - contained introduction of _ _",
    "ai__at , here adapted to the study of the relative stabilities of small mg@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters at a finite temperature and pressure.@xcite .",
    "after showing the phase diagram of mg@xmath6o@xmath1 , we discuss the issue of `` coexistence regions '' . by coexistence regions , we mean areas of the @xmath7 phase diagram where different compositions and/or different isomers of the same composition coexist , as their free energies are nearly degenerate .",
    "we have implemented a parallel algorithm for global search , tailored for cluster structures . building on the known genetic algorithm ( ga)@xcite approach , we designed a cascade genetic algorithm ( cga ) for finding the global - minimum- ( gm ) and lowest local - minimum - energy structures of a cluster of certain size and composition .",
    "ga is a global - optimization technique based on the principles of natural evolution . in general",
    ", a ga includes the following steps : an initial population is formed with a group of individuals created randomly .",
    "the individuals in the population are then evaluated via a so - called fitness function , designed to quantify how well they satisfy chosen criteria .",
    "this ( scalar ) fitness is the quantity to be optimized .",
    "two individuals are then randomly selected , with weight based on their fitness , the higher the fitness , the higher the chance of being selected .",
    "these individuals `` mate '' , i.e. , are combined to create one candidate offspring , that can be in turn `` mutated '' randomly . in the next selection for `` mating '' , this new individual is included in the pool of candidates and can be selected on the basis of its fitness . this continues until a suitable solution has been found or a certain number of iterations have passed , depending on convergence criteria .    in our cascade scheme",
    "successive steps employ higher level of theory and each of the next level takes information obtained at the immediate lower level .",
    "it proceeds by first performing an extensive ga pre - scanning of structures by means of a computationally inexpensive classical force field ( here , reaxff @xcite ) .",
    "the low - energy structures found with this scanning are used as initial guess for further , extensive ga for the minimization of the _ ab initio _ total energy of the clusters . in this second ga search , we look for global minima ( at different stoichiometries ) of the pes s described by the the van - der - waals - corrected@xcite pbe0@xcite hybrid functional ( pbe0+vdw ) . in order to alleviate the computationally ( prohibitively ) expensive direct relaxation ( local optimization ) of structures with a hybrid functional",
    ", we found that a very efficient strategy is to relax the candidate structures by means of a lower - level functional , namely pbe+vdw ( the van - der - waals - corrected @xcite pbe @xcite functional ) but the pbe+vdw energetics are not used for the evaluation of _ fitness _ function .",
    "the _ fitness _ function is evaluated after finishing an additional step of calculating total energy using pbe0+vdw at the geometry fixed to the one found in the former step ( see below for details and discussion of an alternative scheme ) .",
    "such an algorithm yields reliable predictions only if local equilibrium pbe+vdw structures are close to hybrid xc - functional one .",
    "this assumption has been thoroughly tested for selected mg@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters ( namely , mg@xmath8o@xmath8 , mgo@xmath9 , mg@xmath10o@xmath10 , mg@xmath10o@xmath11 , mg@xmath11o@xmath12 ) where we found that the difference between pbe0+vdw binding energies for structures relaxed at the gga xc - functional level and that of at the hybrid xc - functional level are negligible .",
    "one major possible source of inefficiency in using a dft - based search from scratch is related to the creation of the initial pool . since the aim of the ga approach is to perform an unbiased scan of the structures",
    ", the initial pool should be ideally composed of ( constrained ) random structures at a given composition .",
    "however , running a geometrical optimization by starting form a random structure can require several hundreds if not thousands of optimization steps . performing such optimization fully at the dft level",
    "is impractical .",
    "furthermore , a lot of computational effort may then be spent in converging the forces for configurations very far from a local minimum , where high accuracy is not needed . a way of overcoming this problem is to perform local optimization of randomly formed structures by means of a force field . in principle",
    "this pre - relaxation could serve already as a starting point for dft - based ga . in practice ,",
    "due to the inexpensiveness of a classical force field when compared to dft calculations , we performed a thorough ga scan with the force field and the low - energy structures generated in this way served as _ initial pool _ for the dft scan .",
    "this choice , however , carries a potential danger , i.e. , that the optimization performed at the force - field ( ff ) level biases the initial pool for the dft scan , such that a relevant portion of the configurational phase space remains unexplored . in the following",
    "we show that , when using a ff as flexible as reaxff for the ff - based initial ga , no such bias is introduced .",
    "however , we also show that the reaxff results are subject to significant errors in the relative energies and structures . even if a dft post - relaxation is performed on the pool obtained via reaxff , important structures ( including the gm ) can be missed .",
    "schematically , our cga algorithm proceeds as follows ( all terms typeset in italic will be explained afterwards ) :    1 .",
    "selection of a composition of the clusters and formation of an initial pool of ( constrained ) random structures , locally optimized by a ff .",

    "if not rejected , the next step is performed .",

    "if so , ff - ga is stopped and the next step , i.e. , dft - ga , is performed .",

    "e.   further local optimization of the child with pbe+vdw , _ high - level settings_. f.   evaluation of _ fitness _ function based on pbe0+vdw total energy , with the geometry found in the former step .",
    "g.   check whether _ convergence _ has been reached .",
    "if so , stop .    in the following ,",
    "we explain one by one the keywords introduced in the scheme above .",
    "we generate structures with atoms randomly distributed on the surface of an ellipsoid with axes of random length , with the constraint that the closest distance between neighbours is larger than a certain threshold value and for mg - o , o - o , and mg - mg , the threshold values were set to 1.5 , 1.0 and 2.75 @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "these threshold values are set as 75% of the equilibrium bond distance of the three isolated dimers .",
    "the constrained random generation algoritm is built in order to get structures in three flavours : nearly spherical ( three axes of almost equal length ) , prolate ( two short axes , one long ) and oblate ( two long axes and one short ) .",
    "the limit of prolate structures are linear structures and the limit of oblate ones are planar structures .",
    "+ for benchmarking , we strictly obeyed these rules .",
    "however , in practice it is sometimes beneficial to accompany the random structures with some other structures constructed by using any available prior knowledge or chemical intuition of the system .",
    "one ( obvious ) example in the case of the mg@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters is constructing a parallelepipedal rocksalt - like structure for a stoichiometric cluster with a suitable number of atoms ( e.g. , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ... ) .      each cluster @xmath16 in the population",
    "is assigned a normalized fitness value , @xmath17 , based on its total energy ( binding energy for the ff ) : @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the relative energy of the @xmath20 cluster as defined below : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total energy of the @xmath20 cluster of the population and @xmath23 correspond to the dynamically updated lowest and highest total energies in the population , respectively .    with this definition , low ( more negative ) energy clusters have high fitness and high ( less negative ) energy clusters have low fitness .",
    "we use a `` roulette - wheel '' selection criterion @xcite with selection probability proportional to the value of the normalized fitness function .",
    "the idea is that the lower the total ( or binding ) energy ( i.e. , large negative value ) of a certain configuration , the larger the probability to be chosen from the population .",
    "a cluster is picked at random and is selected for mating if its normalized fitness value ( @xmath17 , defined in the previous paragraph ) is greater than @xmath24 $ ] , a randomly generated number , uniform in the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "a subtle problem is related to a possible `` poisoning '' of the selection pool with many structures that are all similar too each other .",
    "we have noticed that , frequently , a basin in the pes contains many local minima .",
    "these minima are different enough from each other to be judged as not _",
    "similar _ by the geometric criterion defined below ; on the other hand , some persistent topological feature is shared among all such minima .",
    "in such cases , the genetic pool may be flooded by a large number of alike structures , energetically close to the running gm , due to the high likelihood that mating among similar structures produces similar structures .",
    "ga takes then significantly long time to reach another basin in the pes .",
    "this problem is known as `` too early convergence '' ( or pre - convergence ) @xcite and , traditionally , the only suggested strategy to obviate this problem is to restart ga using a set of completely different random initial structures .",
    "however , we found ( see below ) that by selecting with small but non - negligible probability one `` bad '' ( high - energy ) structure in the population helps in moving out to a different basin . therefore ,",
    "we define also a complementary fitness function @xmath26",
    "so that , with properly tuned frequency ( see section [ ga - remd ] for details ) , we allow for the selection of one structure with high @xmath27 , which is combined via _ crossover _ with another structure selected via the usual high-@xmath17 criterion . in section [ ga - remd ] , we show that this choice greatly helps the convergence of the ga scheme and we also show how we optimized the mixing ratio among different selection rules .",
    "the crossover operator takes care of combining the parent clusters selected as explained above .",
    "we have implemented three rather different crossover operators .",
    "all such operators are applied to two ( one could use more than two , in principle ) selected parents and the first step is always to apply to both parent clusters a random rotation around their center of geometry , which is fixed at the origin of the coordinate axes for convenience .",
    "the crossover schemes differ in the way the hard constraint of imposing to the newly assembled cluster ( the _ child _ ) the same stoichiometry of the parent clusters is implemented .",
    "\\(i ) crossover-1 : this is a combined crossover and mutation ( see below ) . the strategy is to decouple the atomic coordinates from their species .",
    "let us consider that atomic coordinates of a cluster are listed in a `` geometry '' file where each line contains the four coordinates ( three space plus one spin coordinate ) of an atom and a label for its species .",
    "the sequence of atomic species in such geometry file is defined once and for all throughout the ga scan .",
    "this fixes the stoichiometry .",
    "if the cluster contains an even number @xmath28 of atoms ( @xmath29 ) , a child is built by taking from parent a , after the random reorientation , the coordinates of the @xmath30 atoms that are above a @xmath31 plane , where @xmath32 is chosen in order to have precisely @xmath30 atoms above it . from parent b ,",
    "the coordinates of the @xmath30 atoms that are below a suitable @xmath33 plane are taken . in case @xmath28 is odd , the parent with the highest fitness , let s say a , contributes with one extra atom , selected by adjusting the cutting plane @xmath31 to the purpose .",
    "this procedure produces a list of @xmath28 lines containing the coordinates . to this list",
    ", it is pasted the fixed column of the labels indicating the atomic species .",
    "thus , some of the atoms may swap species . after assemblage one or more pair of atoms",
    "may be found to be `` too close '' ( closeness is defined with the same three thresholds mentioned above ) .",
    "this can happen only at the interface between the two pieces of the parents . in this case",
    "the two halves are pushed away along the @xmath34-axis until the minimum distance between pairs is satisfactory .",
    "also this adjustment operation is regarded as _ mutation _",
    "( see below ) .",
    "this approach is efficient in proposing new structures with the correct composition , but often , due to the interchange of atomic species , it can destroy those local features that determine a high fitness for the parent clusters .",
    "we have seen that the use of this crossover operator promotes a rapid decrease in energy of the running gm .",
    "however , due to the built - in large variation of local composition at the interface between the halves of the parent clusters , the finding of the actual gm may be hindered . according to our sampling ,",
    "also the total spin of the clusters is left free to evolve together with the spatial coordinates of the atoms . in this way we sample on equal footing the configurational space of atomic coordinates and the spin .",
    "the crossover of the spin coordinates is performed in the following way : when we create a new child by grabbing the atomic coordinates from the parents as explained above , we also make note of the atom - projected spin moments ( via hirshfeld partitioning of the electron density ) for each atom .",
    "such spin moments are given as initial moments of the individual atoms of the child . during the optimization process",
    ", these atom - projected moments are left free to change .",
    "( ii ) crossover-2 : this is close to the cut - and - splice crossover operator of deaven and ho @xcite .",
    "after the reorientation , atoms with positive @xmath34-value are selected from one cluster and atoms with negative @xmath34-value are selected form the other cluster .",
    "these complementary fragments are spliced together . in this way",
    "the stoichiometry is not necessarily preserved .",
    "the choice , here , is to accept the child if the stoichiometry is preserved , otherwise reject it , select new parents , and iterate the procedure until the child has the required stoichiometry @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that it helps to maintain winning features of the parent molecule but most of the time it takes many attempts to obtain a valid child , even for a moderately sized cluster . in case",
    "one or more pairs of atom are too close , we adopt the same remedy as for crossover-1 .",
    "the spin coordinates are taken care of the same way as in the crossover-1 case .",
    "\\(iii ) crossover-3 : after re - orientation of the selected parent clusters we take all the metal ( mg ) atoms from one parent molecule and all the oxygen atoms from the other parent molecule .",
    "this crossover helps introducing diversity in the genetic pool , but the rate of rejection during the assemblage of the child can be rather high due to the high likelihood that two atoms are too close .    other crossover rules can be designed for this particular system and a totally different one may be needed for a different system .",
    "for instance , we have extended our scheme to periodic structures , in order to treat , e.g. , structures adsorbed on ( not necessarily clean ) surfaces and defects in bulk materials .",
    "this extension will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the three mentioned schemes are thus not intended to form an exhaustive set of crossover operators , but rather to propose a sufficiently diversified set , so that we can in the following meaningfully test one scheme or combinations of schemes against another in order to find which scheme , or combination , is more robust in finding the gm of the test pes s .",
    "after crossover , which generates a child , mutation is introduced . as for crossover , different mutation operators can be defined .",
    "we have adopted a ) a rigid translation of the two halves of the clusters relative to each other ( this is performed if atoms coming from the two different parents find themselves too close upon splicing of the two halves ) and b ) exchange of the atom species without perturbing their coordinates ( this is included in crossover-1 , but not performed after crossover-2 and -3 ) .",
    "we have purposely not introduced any such mutation after crossover-2 and -3 .",
    "since we mix different kinds of crossover ( as explained in section-[ga - remd ] ) along with different selection schemes ( as discussed in section-[sr ] and [ ga - remd ] ) , there is always the chance that a species exchange is performed , via crossover-1 .      in order to decide whether a newly found structure was already seen previously during the ga scan , after the local optimization we a ) compare the energy of the new structure with that of all the others seen before and b ) use a criterion based on the distances between all the atoms pairs . in practice",
    ", we construct a coarse - grained radial distribution function ( rdf ) of the clusters , consisting of 14 bins conveniently spaced .",
    "each bin contains the ( normalized ) number of atom pairs whose mutual distance is included between the two distances that define the boundaries of the bin . for each cluster",
    "we have then a 14-dimensional rdf - array and the euclidean distance ( i.e. , the square root of the sum of the squared difference between corresponding elements in the two arrays ) between the arrays arranged for two clusters is evaluated .",
    "if this distance ( note that it is a pure number ) is greater than a convenient threshold ( we used 0.01 ) , then the structures are considered as different in the opposite case , if also the energies of the two clusters are within 0.005 ev , the two structures are considered as _",
    "similar_. + we notice that this very simple similarity criterion uses a descriptor of the cluster , the 14-dimensional rdf - array , that is invariant upon rigid translations and rotations of the cluster , and upon permutation of the atoms of the same species .",
    "we start by noticing that the child - assemblage step is usually a computationally cheap part of the algorithm ( not always , see below ) , because it requires just some i / o manipulation .",
    "the local optimization step is the computationally expensive part of the algorithm , in particular at the _ ab initio _ level , because one needs several energy and force evaluations . for a wide range of clusters ,",
    "fully _ ab initio _ based global optimization search is computationally expensive , and becomes prohibitive rapidly for larger cluster sizes .",
    "moreover , if the initial members of the population ( randomly generated and then relaxed clusters ) are far away from the actual gm , the convergence becomes extremely time - consuming .",
    "therefore , we have adopted a classical ff ( namely reaxff)@xcite for performing a computationally inexpensive pre - scan of the pes of the clusters .",
    "dimer , it gives bond length and vibrational frequency within 1 % and 5% from the respective reference values . ]    for dft - based local optimization , we are using the `` trust - radius - method enhanced version of the bfgs optimization algorithm '' , as implemented in the full - potential , all - electron numerical - atomic - orbitals - based code fhi - aims,@xcite which is the code we also chose for the evaluation of energies and forces at the dft level .    in the _ low - level settings _ dft calculations ,",
    "forces were converged to less than 0.01 ev /  , using the van - der - waals - corrected @xcite pbe exchange and correlation functional@xcite , henceforth labelled pbe+vdw .",
    "the grid settings were set to `` light '' and the basis set to tier-1 @xcite .",
    "the main reason of this intermediate step is the implementation of the _ early - rejection _ scheme .",
    "although , as shown in sections [ comp - funct ] and [ rpa ] , the geometry and the energy of the structures is not fully converged with pbe+vdw @ _ low - level settings _ , we have realized that there is a one - to - one mapping between the structures found at this level and those fully converged . in other words , if two structures are _ similar _ ( according to the criterion described in section [ ss ] ) with geometries locally optimized with the pbe+vdw @ _ low - level settings _ , then they are _ similar _ also when the geometries are further optimized at the pbe+vdw @ _ high - level settings _ ( see below ) . in practice , the _ early - rejection _ scheme consists in rejecting those structures that , when optimized with _",
    "low - level settings _ , result in _ similar _ to already known structures or are more than 1.5 ev higher in energy than the current gm . with this ( rather conservative ) choice , we avoid the risk of rejecting structures that would eventually result in the gm or close to it . note that child structures that are rejected at this stage because of high energy are not forgotten . for them ,",
    "the energy at the pbe0+vdw @ _ high - level settings _ is in any case calculated ( without further optimization ) and their fitness evaluated .",
    "thus , there is a chance that they are selected as parents ( in particular in the mixed @xmath35 scheme ) .",
    "this pbe0+vdw evaluation is necessary in order to have a comparison with the fully optimized structures using consistent quantities .",
    "furthermore , while passing from pbe to pbe0 can change considerably the relative energies ( see below ) , further optimizing from _ low - level settings _ to _ high - level settings _ lowers the energy by no more than 0.2 ev .",
    "thus the rejected structure enters the competition for the selection with a _ fitness _ evaluated with a large error bar , but still acceptable . on the other hand",
    ", it would be unwise to forget such structure , as variety is one necessary ingredient of a successful ga scan .    in the pbe+vdw , _ high - level settings _ optimization , atomic forces",
    "were converged to less than @xmath36 ev /  .",
    "the grid settings where set to `` tight '' and the basis set was tier-2 @xcite . in cascade , for the structure optimized with pbe+vdw , _ high - level settings _ , we evaluate ( without further optimization ) the pbe0+vdw energy with the tier-2 basis set . this energy is later used for the calculation of fitness of that particular cluster . the difference between binding energy for an isomer optimized with pbe0+vdw forces ( tight / tier 1 / forces converged to 10@xmath37 ev /  ) and the binding energy of the same isomer optimized with pbe+vdw ( tight / tier 2 / forces converged to 10@xmath37",
    "ev /  ) , when the energy of both geometries is evaluated via pbe0+vdw ( tight / tier 2 ) , is small , i.e. at most 0.04 ev among all cases we checked .",
    "the computational cost of the pbe0+vdw further optimization would be thus not worthy ( we estimated a gain of up to a factor 2 of overall computational time just by skipping the latter optimization ) a two - level scheme , reminiscent of our cascade approach , was already introduced in ref . , but our approach goes beyond that , e.g. , by including the initial pre - screening of structures performed through ff - ga .",
    "furthermore , the fine tuning of the several levels of our cascade approach ( choice of the functionals , of the levels of increasing accuracy ) is here motivated by carefully selected benchmark tests , discussed in section [ vld ] .",
    "an alternative to our scheme , where the spin is left free to evolve during the electronic - structure optimization , is to perform several parallel and independent searches at a given stoichiometry with different fixed spins . in this way",
    ", the spin at all levels along the cascade would be fixed , in particular pbe and pbe0 electronic structure calculations ( with the same geometry ) will have the same spin ( as well as the same geometry ) .",
    "this feature allows for a fascinating possible short - cut for the estimate of the pbe0 ( or , in general , of the hybrid xc - functional ) energy , i.e. , calculating pbe0 xc energy by using pbe orbitals , without performing the self - consistent field ( scf ) optimization . in practice",
    ", this would be a perturbative pbe0 calculation , using the pbe orbitals  ] as starting point . given the perturbative nature of this energy evaluation , the spin of converged pbe and perturbative pbe0 must agree , otherwise the orbitals would be too different .",
    "+ following this approach , provided that the non - scf pbe0 ( relative ) energies are a good approximation of the converged pbe0 energies , the advantage in terms of cpu time is evident",
    ". however , a ) the fact that perturbative pbe0 yields reliable relative energies among the different isomers must be tested for each system and b ) the speed up for the single pbe0 calculation is obtained at the expense of the necessity of performing more than one fixed spin ga for each stoichiometry , in fact c ) it is not always easy to estimate the full list of possible low - energy spin states for a given stoichiometry .",
    "+ we have tested this alternative route on selected stoichiometric clusters , ( namely mg@xmath38o@xmath38 , mg@xmath9o@xmath9 , mg@xmath8o@xmath8 ) and non - stoichiometric clusters ( namely , mgo@xmath9 , mg@xmath10o@xmath11 , mg@xmath9o@xmath8 ) .",
    "+ we have noticed that , perturbative pbe0 yields reasonably good relative energies , compared to the converged pbe0 for some of the stoichiometric cases , namely mg@xmath39o@xmath39 and mg@xmath8o@xmath8 . for these two systems the maximum absolute error by using perturbative pbe0 is 0.25  ev ( wrt converged pbe0 , over the set of 4 lowest - energy mg@xmath39o@xmath39 isomers and 10 lowest - energy mg@xmath8o@xmath8 isomers ) .",
    "this error is evaluated by using as independent reference the energies of the gm in both cases , converged and perturbative , and comparing the energies relative to the respective gm . + for mg@xmath38o@xmath38 and the non - stoichiometric clusters , the outcome is rather different .",
    "the maximum absolute error is above 1  ev in all those cases and even above 2 ev for all non - stoichiometric cases , where the errors can have both signs .    in order to explain this , we need to mention that stoichiometric clusters in their global minimum are singlets @xcite . for mg@xmath9o@xmath9 ,",
    "mg@xmath8o@xmath8 all the isomers in the energy window we considered where also singlets .",
    "although mg@xmath38o@xmath38 s global minimum structure is a singlet , many of the higher energy isomers admit nearly degenerate spins ( singlet and triplet ) . for non - stoichiometric clusters , we find several global minimum ( as well as higher energy ) structures with nearly degenerate spins . upon comparison of pbe and pbe0 kohn - sham orbitals for the isomers yielding the largest errors , we attribute the behavior to level crossings , which we see always appearing in connection with quasi - degenerate spin states , for the systems we have examined .    in summary , for those stoichiometric clusters for which no isomers with degenerate spin are found , the fixed spin + perturbative pbe0 is a practical route with computational cost lower than the variable - spin alternative .",
    "therefore , the perturbative pbe0 energies are reliable enough for the ga scheme , in terms of energy - based likelihood of selection of isomers for the crossover .",
    "however , accurate converged pbe0 energetics must be evaluated at the end of the ga scan , although only for the low energy clusters .",
    "for all the other cases , the large absolute errors make it impossible to rely on the perturbative - pbe0 energetics for constructing the fitness function .",
    "furthermore , for the non - stoichiometric clusters , we observe a systematic lower number of iterations for converging the electronic structure when the spin is left free to evolve , compared to the fixed - spin case .",
    "in other words , for non - stoichiometric mg@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters , the free - spin scf optimization is more efficient that the fixed - spin one .",
    "as it should be clear form the analysis of the ga algorithm steps , the operation of selecting from the genetic pool two structures for the mating and the subsequent local optimization of the child , is an operation that can be performed at any moment also when a local optimization of a child is already running .",
    "the algorithm is thus suitable for a very efficient parallelization .",
    "it should be noted here that fhi - aims is very efficiently parallelized@xcite and on top of this parallelization we add a second level of parallelization , i.e. , we run at the same time several local optimizations , independently .",
    "the only communication among such replicas is the selection of the parents that is performed from a common genetic pool .",
    "the latter is also updated by each replica at the end of each local optimization .",
    "the local optimizations run independently , i.e. , each replica can start a new mating + local optimization cycle right after one is concluded ; hence , there is no idling time between cycles .",
    "thus , we have @xmath40 local optimizations running in parallel , each requiring @xmath41 cores , does not need to be the same for all replicas , but , since we deal with systems of the same size , this is the natural choice . note that for ff - ga @xmath42 that fill the @xmath43 cores required for the algorithm .",
    "the scaling behavior is about o(@xmath44 ) with the number of cores for the local optimization part , as discussed in ref . .",
    "the number @xmath41 is indeed tuned in order to be sure that the speed - up is still o(@xmath44 ) for the specific system .",
    "the scaling with respect to the @xmath40 replicas is linear , because the replicas are for the most of the time independent and only at the beginning and at the end of each local optimization , information is shared among the replicas .",
    "the first level of parallelization is performed within the fhi - aims code , by means of the mpi environment .",
    "the second level is script based : the total @xmath43 number of cores is divided into @xmath40 groups , @xmath40 subdirectories are created and in each of them a cycle of local optimization job runs , each using @xmath41 cores .      a robust criterion for the convergence of a global scanning of a high - dimensional pes does not exist .",
    "an operative criterion is to continue the search until , for a `` long while '' , no new structure with better fitness than the current optimal one is found . as `` long while '' , one can set a time that is several times the time employed to find the current optimal structures . in the present work we scanned for at least double the time needed to find the actual gm .",
    "a ga algorithm applied to structure optimization is thus configured as a sequence of local optimizations , followed by large jumps in the configurational space ( the generation of the child by combining two parent structures ) .",
    "the goal of the scanning is to find the gm , but also a large set if not all structures energetically close to the gm . in fact , it is not necessary to know a single gm structure , but also whether other nearly degenerate structures are present .",
    "the underlying assumption behind the crossover scheme is that that piecewise the geometrically localized features of the high fit structures ( the target of the search ) can be randomly formed during the scan ( already present in the random initial pool or randomly hit by mutation ) and that those `` winning '' local features have a high chance of being propagated , i.e. , structures containing those local features have higher fit and have high chance to be selected for generating a new structure . by `` local feature '' we literally mean the local arrangement ( e.g. , bond distances and angles with first nearest neighbours ) of an atom or a group of atoms .",
    "after the dft - ga search is concluded , we perform a calculation of the harmonic vibrations of each structure within an energy window of 1 ev from the gm .",
    "this step has two purposes .",
    "the immediate purpose is to identify unstable structures , i.e. , structures having imaginary vibrational frequencies .",
    "the other purpose is to store the frequencies for the stable structures for the evaluation of the vibrational free energy ( see section [ sec : aiat ] ) . in case",
    "a structure is found unstable , we perturb its geometry along the unstable mode ( i.e. , the mode related to the imaginary frequency ) and then proceed by locally optimizing it .    within fhi - aims ,",
    "harmonic vibrational frequencies are computed via finite differences of the analytic forces .",
    "it should be mentioned here that for mgo clusters we have found many structures that , at the usual recommended level of accuracy ( really - tight grid settings , forces converged to @xmath36 ev /  ) , showed soft modes mixed with the rigid - body motions . by inspection ,",
    "these soft modes were identified as finite rotations of moieties such as o@xmath6 with respect to the rest of the clusters . in order to numerically resolve the soft modes , we found that a force convergence criterion at @xmath45 ev /   is needed as well as grid tighter than really - tight .",
    "the latter was achieved by setting a radial multiplier @xcite equal to 4 ( instead of the default 2 ) on top of the really - tight grid settings .",
    "any ga algorithm that aims at yielding a reliable scanning of the pes , demands for a performance test against an expectedly more reliable scheme .",
    "global searches are hardly exhaustive , but , for the cluster sizes we are currently interested in ( less than 100 atoms ) , we identified replica - exchange molecular dynamics ( remd)@xcite as a reliable tool able to span the configurational space of a given ( constant number of particles ) system . in this approach",
    ", various replicas of the system are simulated at the same time , each one at a different temperature , and at intervals the replicas are allowed to exchange complete configurations , according to the importance sampling monte carlo acceptance rule , based on the boltzamnn factors of the involved structures : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the total energies of the two selected structures .",
    "this rule ensures that the sampling remains canonical at all temperatures .",
    "+ in remd , the high temperature replicas allow the sampling to quickly reach regions in the potential energy surface that would not be accessible in the time scale of a regular low - temperature md simulation . on the other hand ,",
    "the low - temperature replicas sample the visited basins with the necessary detail for collecting statistical averages .",
    "this approach is computationally very expensive but capable to provide us the relative ensemble populations of all the isomers at various temperatures .",
    "we have implemented remd with reaxff ( ff - remd ) as per technical prescriptions discussed in ref . .",
    "several 24-replicas 100  ns ff - remd runs in the temperature range @xmath49  k ( temperatures follow a geometrical progression , i.e. , the _ ratio _ between neighbouring replicas is constant ) are performed for different mg@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters with varying size .",
    "we have ensured that after finding the gm , the system was subsequently run for sufficiently long time and no new low - energy structure was found . in practice ,",
    "the gm was typically found within 10 ns , i.e. , the total run was at least 10 times longer than the time needed to find the gm . here , the purpose of our remd sampling is to find the geometrically optimized local minima .",
    "therefore , we have locally optimized structures coming from the low temperature replicas ( thereby closer to the local minima ) , by extracting them at constant ( frequent ) intervals .",
    "afterwards , we applied the same geometrical criterion for sorting out the similar structures as for cga and thus constructed a pool of low - energy local minima .",
    "the reason for the reliability granted to this scheme is that remd samples the system without any bias , exploiting the dynamics of the system i.e. , following the integration of the equations of motion . only if the system is not ergodic ( loosely speaking",
    ", its configurational space can be partitioned into disconnected regions , such that no trajectory at finite temperature can go from one such region to another ) , remd is not able to explore the whole configurational space .",
    "the highest temperatures of the remd sampling were chosen so that the cluster were molten ; actually we went to near vaporization and we avoided that occasional vaporization of the clusters scattered the atoms by imposing confining walls .",
    "the result of the comparison between remd and our cga are reported in section [ ga - remd ] .",
    "a legitimate question at this point is whether one really needs to perform a dft based ga search after the ff based ga search , or whether a dft post - relaxation of the structures ( possibly in a wide energy window ) that are found by ff - ga is not enough to find all low - energy structures , as they would be found by a dft - ga .",
    "a related question is whether the pre - screening of structures by ff is not biasing the subsequent dft - ga search , by restricting the set of structures provided to dft - ga as starting point to a too limited subset of the configurational space .",

    "[ remd ] is the average over these three initial sets .",

    ", crossover-2 could find the global minimum , while crossover-1 and -3 could not .",

    "the lesson we learn from this comparisons is that one should then combine crossover operators in order to enhance the chance to find the gm .",
    "we note that when designing the ga scheme , one needs to realize that also the average time spent in ff - ga for generating new candidate structures is not the same for different crossover schemes .",
    "for instance , in crossover-1 there is no rejection of candidate structures , because the stoichiometry is forced by construction , while crossover-2 may use several trials before hitting the right stoichiometry .",
    "the additional time required to obtain a successful candidate using crossover-2 becomes increasingly large with cluster size , in particular for very unbalanced stoichiometries , i.e. , number of oxygen ( much ) larger or smaller than the number of magnesium atoms . in the case of ff - ga ,",
    "the time spent in creating a successful candidate with crossover-2 becomes so large that it is even comparable to the time spent in the subsequent local optimization . in fig .",
    "[ cross ] , we have compared the number of force evaluations performed by crossover-1 and crossover-2 after a given cpu time , for a ff - ga scan .",
    "it is clear that crossover-2 always performs less number of force evaluations , irrespective of size of the cluster .",
    "the additional time needed by ff - ga using crossover-2 is due to many rejection moves when the correct stoichiometry is not matched after performing the cut - and - splice operation . in the case of dft - ga",
    "this problem is less important , since force evaluations are orders of magnitude more expensive than for ff - ga .",
    "since however any single replica in dft - ga is performed on several cpus , if the crossover move is performed on a single cpu then also in this case the time spent in blindly producing the right stoichiometry may be noticeable .",
    "the choice of the crossover scheme is not the only tuning parameter that determines the efficiency of the ga scheme .",
    "another crucial parameter is the selection criterion .",
    "if the parent clusters are selected for the crossover with probability proportional to their fitness function , and many similar structures populate the high fitness ( low energy ) region of the genetic pool , then the selection always fishes among very similar structures and escaping from the basin may be very difficult , also with different mutation schemes .",

    "we have tried a scheme with 50% likelihood to select two structures according to the fitness function @xmath17 , and 50% probability that one structure @xmath16 is selected by using the usual fitness function @xmath17 and the other structure @xmath83 by using the complementary fitness function @xmath84 .",
