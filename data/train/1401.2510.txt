    "one unique feature of ultracold trapped atomic gases is the deterministic control that can be exerted  in the laboratory  on the gas and its properties .",
    "the density of the gas , the geometry of the trap , as well as the strength and sign of interaction have nowadays become fully controllable .",
    "deeper theoretical understanding and advanced experimental tools allow one to change the sign of the interaction between the bosonic atoms of the gas in a controllable manner and attractive bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) can be formed in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the novel collapse phenomenon , which is absent in the repulsive gas , has given the attractive bec a special position in contemporary research and manifested itself in the fascinating colllapse and ` bosenova ' experiments @xcite .",
    "not accidentally , one of the first case - studies of occurrence of fragmentation in becs was that of an attractive boson gas in two spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "there the authors described the bosonic gas with a many - body ansatz that appears to be successful at least in the limit where the interparticle interaction is very weak .",
    "one important result of this work was to find the natural orbitals and their natural occupations in a simple analytic expression .",
    "based on this , it was derived that for a given angular momentum @xmath0 the ground state of the system is fragmented . in other words ,",
    "a non - vanishing angular momentum of the system causes the bosons of the gas to be distributed over a vast number of single - particle states , rather than one .",
    "thus , coherence is lost and this renders the system _ not _",
    "describable by the standard gross - pitaevskii theory . in response to this",
    "finding it has been suggested that the definition of the single - particle reduced density matrix and the definition of bose - einstein condensation should be modified @xcite or that in the absence of the symmetry ( isotropy ) of the trapping potential the fragmentation will vanish @xcite . however , these do not clash with a main characteristic of the attractive gas : the angular momentum @xmath0 is imprinted in the gas in a completely different  fragmented  way , than that in the repulsive case .",
    "still , the non - weakly attractive two - dimensional gas and its collapse has not been scrutinized in the light of the above findings . in three spatial dimensions on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that fragmentation and participation of the low - lying excited states @xcite and the presence of total angular momentum @xmath0 @xcite can postpone the collapse . in the present work we examine the structure of the ground state of finite systems with non - zero angular momentum ( am ) and finite non - weak interaction strength",
    "we express the energy of this ground state ( gs ) as a function of @xmath0 and , moreover , we find an expression for the critical ( maximum allowed ) value @xmath2 of the interaction strength .",
    "the method used is the best mean field ( bmf ) theory , that has been introduced and described in ref .",
    "the orbital basis consists of modified gaussian orbitals ( scaled single - particle states of the harmonic oscillator ) . using that , we reveal the structure of the ground state with @xmath3 : it is a distribution of the bosons over the @xmath4 orbitals that above some @xmath0 , differs from the one derived in the many - body ( mb ) treatment @xcite",
    ". however , the energy that we derive for this state can drop lower than that of the gs of the abovementioned work ( also others , see for example ref .",

    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath7 with @xmath8 in dimensionless units where @xmath9 . for @xmath10",
    "the above hamiltonian describes a 2d trapped gas of attractive ultracold bosons . to represent the wave function of the system we use the general mf ansatz ( fock state ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the symmetrizing operator , accounting for the bosonic nature of the wave function .",
    "the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ permanent ] ) describes a fragmented system of @xmath6 particles , where @xmath13 of them reside in the @xmath14 single - particle state ( orbital ) , with @xmath15 , @xmath16 . the total density ( i.e. , diagonal of the single - particle reduced density matrix ) of this state is @xmath17 .",
    "the total ( expectation value of ) angular momentum of this state is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the orbital angular momentum of the orbital @xmath14 .",
    "generally , @xmath20 is a function of the anisotropy of the trap . in the case of an isotropically trapped gas , that we examine here ,",
    "the orbitals are expected to be eigenstates of the ( single - particle ) operator @xmath21 and hence the expectation values @xmath20 equal the eigenvalues @xmath22  . evaluated on the above ansatz [ eq .  ] the total energy takes on the appearance @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the diagonal matrix elements of the single- and two - particle densities . the task of the present work is to find the best mean field : the configuration of eq .",
    "that corresponds to the lowest possible energy .",
    "to represent the single - particle states or orbitals @xmath14 , that the bosons of the system occupy , we use the gaussian solutions of the 2d harmonic oscillator @xcite that have been parametrized with a variational parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the variation of this parameter can capture the contraction and collapse of the gas due to the attraction .",
    "this variational approach has been , in the past , scrutinized and compared to numerical solutions and found to provide a satisfactory approximation to the ground @xcite as well as non - ground states @xcite of the attractive gas .",
    "moreover , current preliminary numerical analysis suggests that the gs of the gas indeed has a gaussian - like profile for all allowed interaction strengths , so that @xmath29-scaled gaussian modes is a justified approximation . in the following analysis",
    "we choose two different but related orthonormal orbital subsets . at first , we make use of the orbital basis @xmath30 consisting of the @xmath31 and @xmath32-type orbitals that solve exactly the 2d non - interacting problem . the orbitals are scaled by a parameter @xmath28 which is to be found variationally and hence optimizes the width of the gaussian .",
    "this particular scaling does not affect the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xmath33 that the orbitals carry , i.e. , they are still eigenfunctions of @xmath21 . then , and in order to include higher am , we switch to the basis consisting of the single - particle functions with quantum number @xmath34 only .",
    "this basis , which is also referred to as the _ lowest landau levels ( lll ) _",
    "@xcite , is explicitly written as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the normalization constant and @xmath37 the scaling parameter .",
    "thus , picking up states only with @xmath34 makes the latter set ( lll ) a subset of the former one @xmath38 .",
    "we demonstrate in the following that the bmf for a given non - zero total am @xmath0 is the state that includes the lll only .",
    "that is , a variational calculation of the energy of a state built over the orbitals of a general @xmath39-basis yields zero occupation numbers for the single - particle states that do not belong to the lll ( non - llls ) .",
    "furthermore , we show that the @xmath40 ground state , for any number of orbitals , is a condensed coherent state , while a generic @xmath3 state is in principle energetically favorable if it is fragmented .",
    "however , the fragmentation ratio is found not to be high .",
    "the gs state of the attractive system is expected to collapse if the parameter @xmath41 exceeds a critical value @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the same holds true for excited states , with the critical value for collapse @xmath2 now shifted to higher values @xcite . here , the inclusion of the variational scaling parameter into the orbitals allows for a good description of the collapse of the condensate and does not constrain the discussion to the limit where @xmath42 , as done in @xcite , which is far from the collapse .",

    "the energy of eq .",
    "( [ energies ] ) for this gs is @xmath75 . by optimizing the latter with respect to @xmath28 we end up with the expression @xmath76 which is of course the gp energy .",

    "as we shall see in this section , the presence of am can change the picture .",

    "we stress here that the lll has been widely used as a basis for the description of the ground state with @xmath3 and known to be an adequate approximation @xcite .",
    "we provide , in addition and , to the best of our knowledge for the first time , a variational argument for the validity of the lll .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ energies ] ) that the part of the energy not depending on @xmath5 admits a minimum when only the @xmath34 single - particle states contribute to the energy functional .",

    "that is , they are a non - decreasing function of @xmath64 ( for given @xmath63 ) . taking into account the signs of each of the terms we see that the total energy functional , in a first order approximation to @xmath77 , admits a minimum when @xmath34 .",
    "this means that only the lll orbitals can have non - zero occupations , for non - zero total am @xmath0 .",
    "we verify this behavior , i.e. , that in the gs with given l only orbitals - members of the lll are occupied , by including terms of second order as well .",

    "we have theoretically demonstrated herein and in agreement with earlier work , that the attractive gas with given angular momentum per particle prefers to fragment over a finite set of single - particle states ( orbitals ) . to determine these states we used the scaled gaussian functions with certain angular momentum that form the so - called lowest landau levels ( lll ) and ,",
    "moreover , a variational argument was given to justify the use of lll .",
    "based on these states a multi - orbital mean field was constructed to calculate the total energy , the fragmentation and the stability of the ground states .",
    "we arrived at the result that , for given total am @xmath0 larger than a critical value , only two of the excited shape - optimized orbitals are populated and these carry all the angular momentum of the system .",
    "specifically , for @xmath186 it is only one particle with a single quantum of angular momentum and another one with the rest @xmath187 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "our results are valid for weak but also moderately large interaction strength @xmath1 .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath28-parameter gives an extra flexibility to our ansatz [ eq .  ( [ lll ] ) ] and allows for a description of the collapse .",
    "the accuracy of this ansatz has been checked numerically .",
    "the ground state of the system has the appearance of a gaussian distribution for all allowed interaction strengths and the agreement with the employed variational ansatz has been found to be satisfactory . while the predicted @xmath188 is shifted to higher values in the variational treatment , qualitatively ( and quantitatively up to a finite moderately large value of @xmath5 ) the numerical and analytical approaches agree ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with that , we calculated the energy of the ground state possessing some finite angular momentum per particle @xmath153 as a function of @xmath153 and @xmath1 .",
    "this finding constitutes a generalization of the previously known result : indeed , from a first order expansion for small @xmath1 we got back the relation for the energy as first presented by wilkin et al . and later on by jackson et al .",
    ", at the many - body @xcite and gross - pitaevskii @xcite levels respectively .",
    "the inclusion of scaled orbitals in our variational multi - orbital approach was a crucial step and allowed us to calculate the finite-@xmath5 corrections to the stability and energy of the 2d attractive gas .",
    "due to this correction the total energy can drop lower than that that predicted in the many - body analysis of ref .",
    "the deviation of our predictions for the distribution of the occupations , above a critical am , from that predicted in reference @xcite should be attributed to the different approaches followed .",
    "herein , we followed a mf approach with a truncated ( to m=13 orbitals ) hilbert space .",
    "a complete study of the 2d attractive gas requires though a ( numerically ) exact analysis for all allowed @xmath5 .",
    "such a study would shed more light on the structure of the many - body ( ground or excited ) states , the exact shape of the single - particle states and their respective occupations as well as on the quantum fluctuations , that are , by definition , left out in a mean field description and are known to grow large for growing @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it would thus be decided whether the occupations of the lll for given am , found here , persist at the mb level .",
    "such a treatment can be accomplished , e.g. , by the usage of the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( abbreviated as mctdhb ) @xcite , which is the subject of forthcoming work .",
    "concerning many - body computations , the choice of an adequate orbital - basis is crucial . in other words ,",
    "what is the optimal number of orbitals that should be included in a many - body study so that the calculation is converged ?",
    "although , a thorough discussion of this fundamental numerical issue goes beyond the scope of the present work we comment on the use of dirac delta distribution as the two - body interaction pseudopotential in many - body ( i.e. , beyond mean field ) theoretical approaches .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that the use of a ( non - regularized ) dirac delta pseudopotential in a system of two interacting ultracold bosons in two dimensions leads to very slow convergence of the ground state energy to that of the non - interacting ground state energy , for any value of the repulsive interaction strength , and to minus infinity for any value of the attractive interaction strength .",
    "thus , the truncation of hilbert space becomes problematic .",
    "in such a case , a narrow gaussian model for the two - body interaction is a suitable choice for the many - body study @xcite .",
    "lastly , we note that the present findings , together with these of ref .",
    "@xcite could play a significant role in vortex engineering in ultracold atomic gases .",
    "the modulation or change in sign of the scattering length could prove helpful in controlling the way the cloud absorbs angular momentum from its environment so that vortex clusters and giants vortices can form and be manipulated .",
    "such engineering could find application in exploring the more complex turbulent atomic gas with large number of vortices , relatively recently achieved in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "a great part of the present work has been carried out in the theoretical chemistry group of heidelberg university .",
