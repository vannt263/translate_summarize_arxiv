    "the superfluid velocity @xmath8 is then proportional to @xmath9 , hence superfluid motion is irrotational , @xmath10 everywhere except for topological defects on which @xmath11 is singular .",
    "such line defects are quantized vortex lines . around each of them the phase of the wavefunction changes by @xmath12 hence giving rise to irrotational circulating flow .",

    "travelling at constant energy , a quasiparticle with insufficient energy will be andreev reflected as a quasihole whose path will practically coincide with that of the incident quasiparticle @xcite . for quasiparticles with higher energies the flow field will be transparent .",
    "quasiholes are either andreev reflected or transmitted in the opposite way .",
    "it is important to notice that the momentum transfer from incident thermal excitations to the flow is negligibly small , so that the andreev reflection offers a practically noninvasive tool for probing the quantized vorticity at low temperatures .",

    "in the low temperature limit ( e.g. , for the lowest accessible temperature @xmath108 ) the difference between all three scattering lengths @xmath76 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is small , in agreement with findings of our earlier paper  @xcite .",

    "we note here that it would be experimentally easier and more practical to detect and measure a difference between scattering cross - sections of andreev reflection from the vortex tangle rather than a difference between scattering lengths of reflection from an individual vortex .",
    "based on the technique  @xcite developed by the ultra low temperature group at lancaster , the experiment can be designed to probe the same vortex tangle by ambient thermal excitations as well as by a purposely generated thermal quasiparticle beam .",
    "a nearly homogeneous vortex tangle should be generated between two black box radiators ( bolometers ) .",
    "one of the radiators will produce a quasiparticle beam propagating through the tangle , while the other will measure a transmitted energy flux .",
    "several vibrating wire detectors should be located inside and around the turbulent tangle to measure a reflected fraction of the particle ( ` number ' ) flux , both in the presence of the incident beam of excitations , produced by one of the black box radiators , and in the case where only ambient excitations are present .",
    "such measurements should be carried out for various temperatures of the quasiparticle beam and of the bulk superfluid to enable the experimentalist to compare the properties of the reflected particle and energy fluxes and hence to determine experimentally a difference between the scattering cross sections for these fluxes .",
