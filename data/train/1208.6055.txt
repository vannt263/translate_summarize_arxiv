    "significant advances presently are being made towards one of the basic goals of nuclear theory , namely , an _ ab initio _ understanding of the nucleus directly as a system of interacting protons and neutrons .",
    "nuclear interactions motivated by quantum chromodynamics are being developed , via effective field theory methods  @xcite , to provide an underlying hamiltonian .",
    "it is then necessary to solve the many - body problem for this hamiltonian , obtaining nuclear eigenstates and predictions for observables . in no - core",
    "configuration interaction ( ncci ) approaches such as the no - core shell model ( ncsm )  @xcite , the eigenproblem is formulated as a matrix diagonalization problem , in which the hamiltonian matrix is represented with respect to a basis of antisymmetrized products of single - particle states , for the full @xmath0-body system of nucleons .",
    "actual ncci calculations must be carried out in a finite , truncated space .",
    "the challenge is to reach a reasonable approximation of the converged results which would be achieved in the full , untruncated space for the many - body system .",
    "the success of the calculation is determined by the rate of convergence of calculated observables ( _ e.g. _ , energies , radii , and electromagnetic moments and transition strengths ) with increasing basis size and the ability to reliably extrapolate these results to the full , untruncated many - body space  @xcite .",
    "convergence rates are sensitive to the choice of single - particle states from which the many - body basis is constructed , as well as the truncation scheme used for the many - body basis .    in practice ,",
    "such calculations have been based almost exclusively on a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "it is worth recalling the special characteristics of this basis which make it particularly convenient for use in the nuclear many - body problem :    \\(1 ) an exact factorization of center - of - mass and intrinsic wavefunctions is obtained in many - body calculations when the oscillator basis is used in conjunction with the @xmath1 truncation scheme , which is based on the total number of oscillator quanta .",
    "thus , precise removal of , or correction for , spurious center - of - mass contributions to the dynamics is possible .",
    "\\(2 ) matrix elements of the nucleon - nucleon two - body interaction are naturally formulated in the relative oscillator basis .",
    "these matrix elements can easily be transformed to the two - body oscillator basis , of functions @xmath2 , by the moshinsky transformation  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of this transformation is lost with any other single - particle basis .",
    "\\(3 ) the oscillator functions constitute a complete _ discrete _ basis for square - integrable functions .",
    "many alternative bases , such as the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation for a _ finite - depth _ potential such as the woods - saxon potential , do not provide this convenience , since for these bases a continuum of unbound single - particle states is needed for completeness .    however , there are also significant motivations for moving beyond the oscillator basis for the nuclear many - body problem  @xcite .",
    "the classic physical limitation of the oscillator basis , for application to the nuclear problem , lies in the gaussian falloff ( @xmath3 ) at large distance @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , for particles bound by a finite - range force , the actual asymptotics are exponential ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this mismatch in asymptotics , _",
    "i.e. _ , the wavefunction tails , between the expansion basis and the physical system imposes a serious handicap on the convergence of calculations with increasing basis size .",
    "the problem is especially significant for observables , such as the root - mean - square radius or @xmath6 strengths , which are sensitive to the large-@xmath4 properties of the nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "here we consider an alternative basis for ncci calculations , built from coulomb - sturmian functions  @xcite .",
    "although we focus on the coulomb - sturmian basis , many of the considerations addressed here are more broadly applicable to alternative single - particle bases for the ncci problem .",
    "first , the procedures and results necessary for using the coulomb - sturmian basis for nuclear many - body calculations are outlined ( section  [ sec - cs ] ) .",
    "then , illustrative calculations for @xmath7{li}$ ] are discussed ( section  [ sec - calc ] ) .",
    "an expanded discussion may be found in  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb - sturmian functions  @xcite , have previously been applied to few - body problems in atomic  @xcite and hadronic  @xcite physics .",
    "they constitute a complete , discrete , orthogonal set of square - integrable functions , while also possessing realistic exponential asymptotics appropriate to the nuclear problem .",
    "the functions on @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 , with radial wave function @xmath10 where the @xmath11 are generalized laguerre polynomials , the @xmath12 are spherical harmonics , @xmath13 is the radial or node quantum number , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the orbital angular momentum and its @xmath16-projection , and @xmath17 is a radial scale parameter , analogous to the oscillator length parameter for the harmonic oscillator functions .",
    "the first several coulomb - sturmian radial functions , for @xmath18 , are plotted in figure  [ fig - functions](a ) .",
    "the radial functions for the harmonic oscillator are shown for comparison in figure  [ fig - functions](b ) .    .",
    "the first five functions ( @xmath19 ) are shown in each case . ]",
    "+    many - body calculations with the coulomb - sturmian basis can make use of the existing computational framework for ncci calculations , but starting from the two - body matrix elements of the hamiltonian in this new basis .",
    "the change of basis transformation has the form @xmath20 where in this expression we label single - particle orbitals for the oscillator basis by unbarred symbols @xmath21 , @xmath22 , _ etc .",
    "_ , and those for the coulomb - sturmian basis by barred symbols @xmath23 , @xmath24 , _ etc . _ the coefficients @xmath25 required for the tranformation are given by the overlaps of the harmonic oscillator and coulomb - sturmian radial wavefunctions , that is , @xmath26 , where @xmath27",
    ". the length parameter for coulomb - sturmian and oscillator functions may be chosen independently in this transformation . with _ different _",
    "@xmath14 quantum numbers is enforced by the @xmath28 factor , regardless of the radial wavefunction .",
    "therefore , the choice of length parameter may be made independently for each @xmath14-space , as @xmath29 , and orthogonality of the basis of single - particle states will still be preserved .",
    "the considerations which enter the selection of the @xmath29 values and the prescription used here are discussed further in  @xcite . ]    for actual calculation of the transformed matrix elements , the infinite sums over single - particle states appearing in the transformation  ( [ eqn - tbme - xform ] ) must be truncated , limited in practice by the available set of oscillator - basis matrix elements . in a single - particle space truncated by number of oscillator quanta , to @xmath30 ,",
    "the sum appearing in  ( [ eqn - tbme - xform ] ) becomes @xmath31 .",
    "the question is whether or not we can practically include enough oscillator shells in the sum to achieve sufficient accuracy for the many - body calculation .",
    "notice that the comparatively longer tails of the coulomb - sturmian functions [ figure  [ fig - functions](a ) ] imply that they will require oscillator functions of significantly higher @xmath13 [ figure  [ fig - functions](b ) ] for their expansion .",
    "one might therefore ask now what we have gained by changing to an alternative radial basis , if we must still expand the new basis in terms of high-@xmath13 oscillator basis functions .",
    "the essential point is that we need only carry out the expansion at the _ two - body _",
    "level , where it is still tractable , to encode the information needed for treatment of the _ @xmath0-body _ problem in the new basis .",
    "although the truncated transformation  ( [ eqn - tbme - xform ] ) is found to suffice for the matrix elements of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , with @xmath32 ( section  [ sec - calc ] ) , the matrix elements of the kinetic energy are significantly more sensitive to the shell cutoff in the transformation .",
    "these matrix elements may instead be evaluated directly , making use of the particularly simple form of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "the ncsm intrinsic hamiltonian has the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the galilean - invariant relative kinetic energy operator @xmath35.\\ ] ] here the prime on the summation @xmath36 indicates @xmath37 .",
    "this operator is seen to decompose into a one - body part and a separable two - body part .",
    "the coulomb - sturmian functions have a momentum - space representation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , which is given simply in terms of a jacobi polynomial  @xcite .",
    "matrix elements of the one - body term are readily evaluated as radial integrals of @xmath40 .",
    "those of the two - body matrix elements factorize by racah s reduction formula  @xcite , as @xmath41 where each factor may again be evaluated in terms of a radial integral , more specifically , as @xmath42 \\trme{l_bj_b}{y_1}{l_aj_a}$ ] .",
    "as a basic illustration of the use of the coulomb - sturmian basis for ncci calculations , we now consider the nucleus @xmath7{li}$ ] .",
    "the code mfdn  @xcite is used for the many - body calculations , taking as its input hamiltonian two - body matrix elements obtained as outlined in section  [ sec - cs ] .",
    "the calculations are carried out for the jisp16 interaction  @xcite .",
    "{ li}$ ] @xmath43 ground state energy , calculated using the conventional harmonic oscillator basis  ( left ) and the coulomb - sturmian basis  ( right ) . calculated energies  ( top ) and rms radii  ( bottom )",
    "are plotted as a function of the basis @xmath44 parameter , for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ( successive curves , as labeled ) . for the coulomb - sturmian basis ,",
    "calculations are shown variously for truncations @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ( dotted , dashed , and solid curves , respectively ) .",
    "exponentially extrapolated values are indicated by crosses .",
    "the best extrapolated values from the large - basis calculations of  @xcite are shown as horizontal dashed lines . ]",
    "+    the @xmath1 truncation for the harmonic oscillator many - body basis is defined by the condition @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the total number of oscillator quanta , and @xmath54 is the minimal number of oscillator quanta for the given number of protons and neutrons .",
    "the calculated results depend both on the oscillator length parameter @xmath17   which is commonly quoted in terms of the oscillator energy @xmath55 , where @xmath56^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath57 is the nucleon mass   and the truncation @xmath1 for the basis .",
    "a natural question is how to truncate the coulomb - sturmian many - body basis , where a total number of oscillator quanta is not defined .",
    "however , we can _ formally _ carry over the @xmath1 truncation scheme , if , for each coulomb - sturmian single - particle state , we simply define @xmath58 and , for each many - body state , we again define @xmath53 .",
    "this choice of many - body truncation is certainly not unique , but it provides a reasonable starting point for further exploration , and it facilitiates comparison of convergence rates obtained using the oscillator and coulomb - sturmian bases , since the dimensions of the many - body spaces are then the same in both cases .    first , let us review the conventional oscillator results for the energy of the @xmath43 ground state , shown in figure  [ fig - conv - e - r](a ) .",
    "for any given choice of @xmath1 , the energy has a variational minimum for some value of @xmath55 , @xmath59 in this example . with increasing @xmath1 , the ground - state eigenvalue approaches that for the infinite , untruncated space .",
    "the horizontal dashed line in figure  [ fig - conv - e - r ] indicates the best extrapolation from prior calculuations in an @xmath60 space  @xcite .",
    "calculations of the ground - state energy using the coulomb - sturmian basis are shown in figure  [ fig - conv - e - r](b ) . at each @xmath1",
    "the variational minimum energy obtained with the coulomb - sturmian basis in figure  [ fig - conv - e - r](b ) is substantially higher than that obtained with the oscillator basis in figure  [ fig - conv - e - r](a ) .",
    "however , the energies obtained with the coulomb - sturmian basis are also falling significantly more rapidly with increasing @xmath1 , and the quality of extrapolation appears to be comparable .",
    "we note that these exploratory results have not yet probed several variational freedoms available with the coulomb - sturmian basis , both in the length parameters @xmath29 ( see  @xcite ) and in the many - body truncation scheme .",
    "the robustness of the many - body calculations against the truncation @xmath61 in the change - of - basis transformation  ( [ eqn - tbme - xform ] ) may also be verified from figure  [ fig - conv - e - r ] , where calculations based on two - body matrix elements obtained with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are overlaid .",
    "the results for the ground state energy for @xmath62 are highly stable with respect to this cutoff .",
    "this range safely covers the variational minimum . if necessary",
    ", it would also be practicable to carry out transformations in larger oscillator spaces .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius presents challenges for convergence in ncci calculations with the conventional oscillator basis  @xcite , since it is more specifically sensitive to the large-@xmath4 asymptotic properties of the nuclear wavefunction .",
    "we compare the results obtained in the oscillator basis , shown in figure  [ fig - conv - e - r](c ) , with those obtained in the coulomb - sturmian basis , shown in figure  [ fig - conv - e - r](d ) .",
    "the extrapolated values obtained for @xmath62 , _",
    "i.e. _ , above the crossover point , are reasonably insensitive to @xmath55 and are consistent with the best estimate from large oscillator - basis calculations  @xcite .",
    "it would appear that the rate of convergence of the rms radius obtained with the coulomb - sturmian basis is superior to that obtained with the conventional oscillator basis .",
    "however , further systematic investigation is required , especially into the stability of extrapolations with increasing @xmath1 , before general conclusions may be drawn .    the dominant concern in using any basis other than the harmonic oscillator basis , with @xmath1 truncation , is incomplete separation of center - of - mass and intrinsic dynamics .",
    "there are several aspects to consider : the degree of separation arising in calculations using the coulomb - sturmian basis , the spurious state spectrum obtained in such calculations , and the extent to which a lawson term  @xcite can be used to purge spurious excitations from the low - lying spectrum . here",
    "we briefly discuss only the first consideration , _",
    "i.e. _ , separation .",
    "however , it is also found that the spurious states are well - separated in the spectrum and are amenable to management with a lawson term ( see  @xcite ) .     for center - of - mass oscillator quanta , as a function of oscillator energy @xmath63 .",
    "these calculations are for the @xmath7{li}$ ] @xmath43 ground state , using the coulomb - sturmian basis , with @xmath64 .",
    "calculations are shown for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ( successive curves , top to bottom ) , and for @xmath61 values as indicated in the caption to figure  [ fig - conv - e - r ] .",
    "the analogous curve expected for a pure harmonic oscillator @xmath65 function , with @xmath66 , is also shown ( dotted curve , labeled ) . ]",
    "+    a first indication of the degree of separation in the many - body eigenstate is provided by the expectation value of the number operator for center - of - mass harmonic oscillator quanta , defined for an arbitrary center - of - mass harmonic oscillator energy @xmath63 by @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the center - of - mass coordinate and momentum , respectively . as noted by hagen",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , _ if _ separation occurs , as @xmath70 , and _ if _ @xmath71 happens to be an oscillator @xmath65 function , corresponding to some oscillator energy @xmath63 , then the many - body wavefunction will have @xmath72 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath73 is shown as a function of @xmath63 for the @xmath7{li}$ ] ground state in figure  [ fig - ncm - distrib ] , for the coulomb - sturmian basis calculation with basis @xmath64 and no lawson term .",
    "the minimum of @xmath73 is obtained at @xmath74 .",
    "the minimum value decreases with increasing @xmath1 , but it appears to be converging towards a _ nonzero _ @xmath75 .",
    "the fact that expectation values significantly less than unity are obtained in the calculations indicates that a @xmath65 oscillator function dominates the center - of - mass motion , and that an approximate separation of center - of - mass and intrinsic functions is spontaneously arising .",
    "however , the nonzero limit indicates that , as the full space is approached , the separated center - of - mass function is _ not _ strictly taking the form of a @xmath65 oscillator function .",
    "although the conventional oscillator basis for the ncci approach provides definite benefits , namely , exact center - of - mass factorization in the @xmath1 truncation and the simplicity of the moshinsky transformation for generating two - body matrix elements , it also exhibits nonphysical gaussian asymptotics at large distances .",
    "the coulomb - sturmian functions form a complete , discrete set of square - integrable functions with realistic exponential asymptotics . a principal goal in using such a basis is to obtain improved convergence of observables which are sensitive to the asymptotics , such as rms radii and @xmath6 matrix elements",
    ". such a basis might be particularly appropriate to halo nuclei , where the mismatch with the oscillator functions at large distances is particularly severe .",
    "the computational framework for the many - body calculation has the standard structure for an @xmath76 single - particle basis , and the interaction matrix elements are transformed from the harmonic - oscillator basis , except that relative kinetic energy matrix elements ( and , in fact , those for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as well ) are calculated directly in the coulomb - sturmian basis .",
    "the initial exploratory calculations considered here indicate that convergence properties are promising .",
    "moreover , the spurious center - of - mass dynamics are found to be tractable .",
