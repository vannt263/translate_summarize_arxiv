    "ly@xmath0 absorption , shortward of ly@xmath0 emission in qso spectra , indicates the presence of intervening absorbers with neutral hydrogen column densities ranging from about @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xmath7 . the absorbers with low column densities , _",
    "e.g. _ from @xmath5 to @xmath8 @xmath7 , are usually called ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "it is generally thought that the low column density absorbers are some kind of weakly clustered clouds consisting of photoionized intergalactic gas ( _ e.g. _ wolfe 1991 ; bajtlik 1992 ) .",
    "this suggests that ly@xmath0 forests are caused by diffusely distributed igm in pre - collapsed areas of the cosmic mass field ( bi , 1993 ; fang et al .",
    "1993 ; bi , ge & fang 1995 ; bi & davidsen 1997 . ) observations of the size and velocity dispersion of the ly@xmath0 clouds at high redshift also show that the absorption probably is not caused by confined objects at high redshifts ( bechtold et al .",
    "1994 ; dinshaw et al .",
    "1994 ; fang et al 1996 ; crotts & fang 1998 . ) with this picture , the baryonic matter distribution is almost point - by - point proportional to the dark matter distribution on all scales larger than the igm s jeans length , i.e. the ly@xmath0 forests would be good tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "thus , the power spectrum of qso ly@xmath0 transmitted flux can be used to estimate the power spectrum of the underlying mass field , and then be used to constrain cosmological parameters ( croft et al 1999 ; mcdonald et al 1999 ; hui 1999 ; feng & fang 2000 . ) a key step in this approach is to compare the power spectrum of observed transmitted flux fluctuations with model - predicted power spectrum .",
    "one uncertainty in the power spectrum determination of the real data is from the normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "therefore , in order to have an effective confrontation between the observed and theoretical power spectrum of ly@xmath0 forests , it is necessary to develop a proper algorithm for the normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "this is the goal of this paper .",
    "the observed flux of a qso absorption spectrum is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the continuum , @xmath11 the transmission , and @xmath12 the optical depth .",
    "the normalized power spectrum of transmission is the power spectrum of the transmission flux fluctuations @xmath13 , defined as @xmath14 that is , the transmission power spectrum is normalized by the mean flux @xmath15 . in other words ,",
    "the normalization of the transmission power spectrum is determined by two factors : the continuum @xmath10 and the mean transmission @xmath16 .",
    "traditionally , the continuum is needed to be determined before the power spectrum calculation .",
    "usually the continuum is obtained by a fitting of polynomial or its variants .",
    "assuming that the continuum fluctuates slowly , the polynomial or its variants are truncated at relatively low orders ( e.g. croft et al 2000 ; hui et al 2000 ) .",
    "the pre - assumed polynomial or other function , and the subsequent truncation may lead to uncertainty of the power spectrum .",
    "another source of uncertainty of the transmission power spectrum is the mean transmission @xmath2 normalization .",
    "the mean transmission is calculated by averaging the flux over the entire wavelength range considered , and the power spectrum is normalized by this mean transmission for all scales .",
    "this implicitly assumes that there is no correlation between the transmitted flux fluctuations and the mean flux .",
    "this assumption is true for a gaussian field , but may not be so for a non - linearly evolved field .",
    "in fact , the fluctuations at position @xmath17 are correlated with the background at the same position @xmath17 .",
    "recent findings that the transmitted flux of ly@xmath0 forests exhibits intermittent behavior ( jamkhedkar , zhan & fang 2000 ) clarifies this point .",
    "that is , the transmitted flux shows prominent spiky feature fluctuations on small scales .",
    "the transmitted flux consists of rare but strong density fluctuations randomly scattered in space with very low fluctuations in between . in this case ,",
    "the power of the transmission fluctuations is mainly dominated by the spikes . on the other hand ,",
    "the transmission @xmath18 is low at the spikes .",
    "that is , the transmission fluctuations are anti - correlated with transmission . as a consequence , the power would be underestimated if the power spectrum is normalized by the mean transmission @xmath2 over the entire wavelength range . since the spiky features are stronger on smaller scales , the normalization by an over - all mean transmission @xmath2 or by a filling factor with a scale - independent flux threshold ( croft et al 2000 ) will cause an underestimation of power on small scales .",
    "recently , we have developed a power spectrum estimator with a multiresolution analysis based on the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) .",
    "the dwt power spectrum estimator is found to be very useful for the recovery of the initially linear power spectrum ( feng & fang 2000 ; pando , feng & fang , 2001 ) . in this paper , we show that the dwt algorithm is also very useful to detect the power spectrum of non - linear field , like an intermittent field .",
    "the dwt algorithm can effectively reduce the above - mentioned uncertainties due to free parameters used for normalization .",
    "we will show that the normalization of a dwt power spectrum does not rely on a continuum fitting and the mean transmission .",
    "moreover , the power spectrum given by this estimator is sensitive to the correlation between the flux fluctuations and the background flux .",
    "that is , the power spectrum can be employed to distinguish among the fields with and without intermittency .",
    "therefore , it would be useful for discrimination among models of the ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows .",
    " 2 introduces briefly the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) analysis of the flux of qso absorption spectrum .  3",
    "presents the self - normalization algorithm of the transmission power spectrum . it does nt need either a continuum fitting , or a calculation of the mean transmission . in  4 , we test the self normalization algorithm .",
    "we show that the self - normalization algorithm can effectively perform the normalization due to either continuum or mean transmission .",
    " 5 will demonstrate that the dwt self - normalized power spectrum is useful to detect the intermittent behavior of the field .",
    "finally , the conclusions and discussions will be presented in  6 .",
    "we rewrite eq.(1 ) as @xmath19 our purpose is to estimate the power spectrum of the flux fluctuations @xmath13 from the observed flux @xmath20",
    ". therefore , eq.(1 ) requires one to decompose the observed flux @xmath20 into two terms : the first one is the background @xmath21 , which does not contain information of the fluctuations considered , while the second term contains all this information .",
    "if the background @xmath21 is @xmath17 dependent and correlated with the fluctuations @xmath13 , the decomposition eq.(1 ) apparently can not be done by truncating at _ a priori _  relative low orders \" .",
    "we will solve this problem by a scale - by - scale analysis , without introducing new parameters . in terms of a scale - by - scale analysis , eq.(1 )",
    "means that to detect the power of the flux fluctuations on the scale @xmath22 , all components of @xmath20 on scales larger than @xmath22 play the role of a background .",
    "therefore , to determine power on the scale @xmath22 , one can decompose the observed @xmath20 into two terms : the first does nt contain any information on scales larger than @xmath22 , while the second contains all information on scales equal to or less than @xmath22 .",
    "this decomposition refers to both the position @xmath17 and the scale @xmath22 , and therefore , we need a scale - space decomposition of the transmitted flux .    on the other hand , the calculation of power spectrum essentially is a decomposition of the flux into scale domains .",
    "therefore , it is possible to do the decomposition of eq.(2 ) by the same scale - space decomposition as that used for measuring the power spectrum . in other words ,",
    "the estimation of the normalization background and the calculation of power spectrum can be accomplished simultaneously .",
    "once the orthonormal bases for power spectrum estimation are given , the term @xmath21 is uniquely determined without free ( or fitting ) parameters .",
    "the fourier power spectrum is not convenient for this purpose , as the bases of fourier transform are not localized in physical space , and they do nt yield a scale - space decomposition .",
    "we will use the dwt , whose bases are localized both in scale and position space ( e.g. mallat , 1989a , b , c ; meyer , 1992 ; daubechies , 1992 ; and references therein , and for physical applications , refer to fang & thews , 1998 . )      a sample of qso ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum gives a list of the flux @xmath20 observed at discrete wavelength @xmath23 , @xmath24 . since @xmath23 corresponds to spatial position @xmath25 , or redshift @xmath26 , one can define a spatial distribution of the flux by @xmath27 [ \\theta(x -\\lambda_i ) - \\theta(x-\\lambda_{i+1})],\\ ] ] where the step function @xmath28 is equal to 1 , for @xmath29 , and 0 for @xmath30 .",
    "the spatial range @xmath31 corresponds to the wavelengths from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .    in the dwt analysis ,",
    "the space @xmath31 is chopped into @xmath34 segments labelled by @xmath35 .",
    "each of these segments has a size of @xmath36 .",
    "the index @xmath37 is an integer .",
    "therefore , the index @xmath37 stands for scale @xmath36 , while @xmath38 is for position , or the spatial range @xmath39 .",
    "we first introduce the scaling functions for the haar wavelets .",
    "they are the top - hat window functions defined by @xmath40 where the superscript @xmath41 stands for haar , and the factor @xmath42 ensures normalization , i.e. @xmath43 where @xmath44 is kronecker delta function .    the scaling function",
    ", @xmath45 is actually a window on a resolution scale @xmath36 at the position @xmath46 .",
    "but it is not normalized like a window function @xmath47 which satisfies @xmath48 nevertheless the mean flux in the spatial range @xmath46 is proportional to @xmath49 the number @xmath50 is called the scaling function coefficient ( sfc ) .    using sfcs , one can construct the flux as @xmath51 @xmath52 is the flux @xmath53 smoothed on scale @xmath36 ( or simply the scale @xmath37 ) .",
    "a higher value for @xmath37 corresponds to smaller scales and vice versa . for a given sample with resolution @xmath54 ,",
    "the original flux can be expressed as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is given by the integer of number @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "@xmath58 contains less information than @xmath53 , because information on scales @xmath59 ( i.e. smaller scales ) has been smoothed out",
    ". it would be nice not to lose any information during the smoothing process .",
    "this can be accomplished if the differences , @xmath60 , between the smoothed distributions on successive scales are retained . in other words , only if we are able to retain all these _ differences _ , this scheme will not lose any information .    to calculate the differences , we define the difference function , or wavelet , as @xmath61 this is the basic haar wavelet .",
    "one can then construct a set of wavelets @xmath62 by dilating and translating eq.(9 ) as @xmath63 the haar wavelets are orthonormal with respect to _ both _ indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath64 for a given @xmath37 , @xmath62 is also orthogonal to the scaling functions @xmath65 for @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67    from eqs.(4 ) and ( 9 ) , we have @xmath68 thus , the difference @xmath60 is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 are called the wavelet function coefficients ( wfc ) given by @xmath71    using the relation ( 14 ) repeatedly , we have @xmath72 this is an expansion of the flux @xmath52 with respect to the basis @xmath62 , and @xmath73 is the mean of @xmath53 on the entire range @xmath31 . therefore , the flux @xmath53 can be can be expressed as @xmath74    the haar wavelet provides a clear picture of the dwt decomposition , and it is also easy for numerical work . however , the haar wavelet is discontinuous in real space , and therefore , it is not well behaved in scale space . for our work ,",
    "the most important properties of the basis for the scale - space decomposition are 1 . )",
    "orthogonality , 2 . ) completeness , and 3 . ) locality in both scale and physical spaces .",
    "therefore , all wavelets with compactly supported basis will produce similar results . among the compactly supported orthogonal bases ,",
    "the daubechies 4 ( d4 ) is easy for numerical calculation .",
    "we will use wavelet d4 .    for the d4 ,",
    "the basic orthonormal eqs.(5 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) still hold after replacing @xmath75 and @xmath76 with d4 scaling function @xmath77 and d4 wavelet @xmath78 .",
    "the expansion eqs.(17 ) are also valid using @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "form eq.(17 ) , the parseval theorem of the dwt gives @xmath79 ^ 2dx = \\sum_{j=0}^{j-1}\\sum_{l=0}^{2^j-1 }      |\\tilde{\\epsilon}^f_{j , l}|^2.\\ ] ] therefore , the power of the mode @xmath80 is @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the power spectrum of the flux @xmath53 is given by ( pando & fang 1998 ; fang & feng , 2000 ; yang et al .",
    "2001 ) @xmath82 the ensemble average of the power @xmath83 should be @xmath38-independent for a homogeneous field .",
    "if the `` fair sample hypothesis '' is true ( peebles 1980 ) , the ensemble average can be replaced by a spatial average , we then have @xmath84 this is the dwt power spectrum of the flux @xmath20 .",
    "it is a band - averaged fourier power spectrum as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the fourier power spectrum with wavenumber @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the fourier transform of the basic wavelet @xmath89 .",
    "this relation has been confirmed with 1-d ( ly@xmath0 ) and 3-d ( n - body ) numerical samples ( feng & fang 2000 ; yang et al . 2001 . )    the dwt algorithm eq.(21 ) have been successfully employed for the power spectrum reconstruction ( feng & fang 2000 ; pando , feng & fang 2001 ) .",
    "it can recover the initial linear power spectrum on small scales as well as large scale .",
    "for the reconstruction , the normalization is simple , as the field is gaussian . for non - gaussian fields ,",
    "the normalization will no longer be trivial , as the non - gaussianity will affect the normalization differently for different algorithm .",
    "using photon numbers @xmath90 , eq.(2 ) can be rewritten as @xmath91 + n_e(x).\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the mean photon number at @xmath93 ( wavelength or redshift ) . the term @xmath94 is given by noise , which includes the background sky , dark current and the instrumental readout noise ( see appendix a ) .    by definition ,",
    "the mean photon number ( or mean flux ) is the background of the fluctuation @xmath95 .",
    "it corresponds to the selection function in the problem of galaxy distribution .",
    "because @xmath96 or @xmath97 are not constant in the entire spatial range , the background can only be defined scale - by - scale . in other words , to measure the power of @xmath95 on a given scale @xmath37 , the background @xmath96 and @xmath97 are given by the mean photon number and mean flux at @xmath93 when all fluctuations on scales smaller than the given scale ( @xmath98 ) are absent , i.e. @xmath99 + n_e(x).\\ ] ] and @xmath100 + e(x).\\ ] ] where @xmath101 contains all information about the transmission fluctuations on scales @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath104 are the mean photon number and mean flux in the spatial range @xmath39 , respectively , i.e. the local mean photon number and mean flux when the mass field clustering on scales @xmath105 is absent . the error term in eq.(24 ) is @xmath106 as @xmath107 .    due to the discreteness of photons ,",
    "the observed photon number @xmath108 should be considered as a sampling of the random field of eqs.(22 ) or ( 23 ) .",
    "our purpose is to estimate the power spectrum of the random field @xmath95 , which describes the fluctuations of the transmission .",
    "if the sampling is poissonian , eq.(22 ) yields @xmath109 the derivation of eq.(25 ) can be found in appendix b which describes both poisson and non - poisson sampling .",
    "considering @xmath110 , the second and fourth terms on the r.h.s .",
    "eq.(25 ) can be rewritten as @xmath111    projecting eq.(26 ) onto the dwt bases @xmath112 , the l.h.s . gives the dwt power spectrum of @xmath95 , i.e. the _ normalized _ dwt power spectrum of the flux fluctuations , @xmath113 the first term on the r.h.s . of eq.(26 ) disappears , because @xmath114 is admissible , i.e. @xmath115 .",

    "it is also reasonable to assume that the noise is uncorrelated with @xmath95 .",
    "eq.(29 ) is the basic estimator of the normalized dwt power spectrum of ly@xmath0 transmitted flux .",
    "the first term on the r.h.s . of eq.(29 ) is the power spectrum of the transmission .",
    "the second and third terms are the corrections due to shot noise and the noise @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "now we turn to the problem of estimating the mean flux @xmath104 .",
    "the definition of @xmath104 given by eq.(24 ) requires a decomposition of @xmath53 , in which the first term contains only information on scales larger than @xmath36 , but nothing on scales less than or equal to @xmath36 , and all the information of flux fluctuations on scales equal to or less than @xmath36 is contained in the second term .",
    "this decomposition is already given by second line of eq.(17 ) , in which @xmath52 is the flux at @xmath93 if all the fluctuations on scales less than or equal to @xmath36 are absent .",
    "thus , to measure the power on scale @xmath37 , one can identify the mean flux @xmath104 with @xmath52 .",
    "obviously , @xmath52 is not constant , except within each small segment @xmath122 , as all fluctuations on scales @xmath102 are smoothed out .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath123 where , for a given @xmath38 , @xmath93 is given by @xmath122 .",
    "eq.(31 ) shows that the mean flux @xmath104 at position @xmath38 can be represented by the sfc @xmath124 for scale @xmath37 .",
    "however , as mentioned in  2.1 , the sfc @xmath124 is proportional to , but not equal to the mean flux at position @xmath38 . to find the proportionality constant",
    ", we use the so - called  partition of unity \" of wavelets given ( daubechies 1992 ) @xmath125 or @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the so - called periodized scaling function ( fang & feng 2000 ) . with @xmath127 , eq.(7 ) can be rewritten as @xmath128 substituting eq.(3 ) into eq.(34 ) , we have @xmath129     \\int_{\\lambda_i}^{\\lambda_{i+1}}\\phi^p_{j , l}(x)dx.\\ ] ] thus , with the  partition of unity \" eq.(32 ) , eq.(35 ) yields @xmath130 ( \\lambda_{i+1}-\\lambda_{i}).\\ ] ] this result is clear . the r.h.s . of eq.(36 ) is the integral flux of the entire spectrum , while the l.h.s . is the integral flux of the smoothed spectrum @xmath52",

    "that is , the power spectrum given by estimator ( 41 ) is continuum - independent . that it , the self - normalization algorithm can produce the power spectrum correctly normalized by the continuum , but without a continuum fitting .      to test the mean transmission normalization of estimator eq.(41 ) , we calculate the so - called unnormalized dwt power spectrum of the transmission , i.e. the power spectrum of continuum normalized flux @xmath177 similar to eq.(20 ) , the unnormalized dwt power spectrum is given by @xmath178 where the wfcs are calculated by @xmath179 the result of @xmath180 for the lognormal sample is plotted in fig .",

    "it shows that @xmath185 on small @xmath37 ( large scales ) is exactly the same as the simulation used @xmath2 .",
    "that is , the estimator eq.(41 ) is able to produce the power spectrum , which is already properly normalized by the mean transmission .",
    "thus , the estimator eq.(41 ) does nt need one to pre - calculate the mean transmission or filling factor for the normalization .",
    "however , on small scales , @xmath185 does nt equal to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , on small scale , the estimator eq.(41 ) is not the same as the traditional normalization by a mean transmission .",
    "this difference will be analyzed in next section .",
    "we call @xmath185 the effective mean transmission . fig .",
    "3 shows that the effective mean transmission @xmath185 is scale - dependent .",
    "it means that the power spectrum given by eq.(41 ) actually is normalized by a scale - dependent factor @xmath185 , not by a mean transmission .",
    "generally , @xmath185 is lower than the mean transmission @xmath2 on small scales .",
    "the scale dependence of the effective mean transmission is due to the anti - correlation between the background @xmath186 and the fluctuation @xmath13 . for a lognormal sample ,",
    "this anti - correlation is shown in fig .",
    "4 . the mean value of the wfcs @xmath187 ( fluctuation ) is larger for smaller sfcs @xmath124 ( background ) , and vice versa . on the other hand ,",
    "the power is dominated by large wfcs , corresponding to smaller sfcs .",
    "thus the normalization by an over - all averaged sfcs , or mean transmission @xmath2 will produce lower power than the power spectrum given by eq.(41 ) .",
    "this anti - correlation comes from the spiky structures of an intermittent field .",
    "it is mostly significant on scale @xmath188 and 9 ( 100 - 250 h@xmath155 kpc ) . on scale @xmath189 ( or 50 h@xmath155 kpc ) , the anti - correlation is weak due to noise .    on the other hand ,",
    "the field on large scales basically is gaussian , i.e. no correlation between the wfcs @xmath187 and the sfcs @xmath124 . in this case eq.(44 ) shows that the normalization can be done by a constant mean transmission @xmath190 .",
    "this is why the mean transmission can be recovered by the ratio eq.(49 ) on large scales [ fig .",
    "3 ] .      in the lognormal model ,",
    "the non - linear feature of the field is induced by the lognormal transform . to further test the normalization of effective mean transmission",
    ", we use simulation samples of the ly@xmath0 forests produced with the so called `` pseudo - hydro '' technique ( croft et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this approach ,",
    "the non - linear density and velocity field of underlying dark matter were obtained by evolving a particle mesh ( pm ) simulation for a specified cosmological model .",
    "the gas density and temperature were then computed using the simple scaling relation inferred from full hydrodynamic simulations ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "the parameters of the simulation are taken to match the keck hires spectra described in croft et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "first , the pm simulations were performed by evolving @xmath191 dark matter particles in a periodic box with a @xmath191 grid . for this study ,",
    "the cosmological model is taken to be the low density flat model ( lcdm ) , which was specified by the density parameter @xmath192 , the cosmological constant @xmath193 , the hubble constant @xmath194 and the baryon density parameter @xmath195 .",
    "the physical size of box was determined correspondingly by 512 pixels around the median redshift @xmath196 of the sample , and a total of 100 time steps were integrated from the initial redshift @xmath197 to @xmath196 .",
    "we then select random lines - of - sight through the simulation box along which to interpolate one - dimensional density and velocity field using the daubechies-4 scaling functions with j=7 .",
    "using one - dimensional density field , we assign temperature to each pixel using the polytropic equation of state @xmath198 , where @xmath199 and @xmath0 depend on the spectral shape of the uv background and on the history of reionization .",
    "we adopt typical values @xmath200k and @xmath201 . the neutral hydrogen fraction in each pixel is computed by adopting the cosmic abundance of hydrogen and assuming photoionization equilibrium .",
    "the optical depth @xmath12 at a given pixel is then obtained by integrating in real space by including the effect of peculiar velocity field and convolving with voigt thermal broadening profile . to match the parameters of observed spectra ,",
    "@xmath12 was computed onto a @xmath202 grid and smoothed by a gaussian window to match with the spectral resolution of observations .",
    "the absorption transmitted spectra @xmath203 is normalized such that the mean transmission in the spectra matches with observations .",
    "we take 29 different values of the mean transmission , at different redshifts .",
    "we calculated the effective mean transmission @xmath185 [ eq.(49 ) ] for the pseudo - hydro simulation samples .",
    "as an example , we show a result of @xmath185 vs. @xmath37 for a simulated sample in fig .",
    "5 . it is similar to fig .",

    "it shows that all the effective mean transmission on this small scale is lower than the corresponding mean transmission used for simulation .",
    "this result is the same as lognormal model .",
    "therefore , the self - normalized power spectrum estimator eq.(41 ) is sensitive to both the mean transmission ( on large scales ) and the anti - correlation between the fluctuation and background on small scales .",
    "the power spectrum given by traditional normalization is only sensitive to the mean transmission , but not the fluctuation - background anti - correlation on small scales .",
    "therefore , the estimator eq.(41 ) would be more useful for the discrimination between models of ly@xmath0 forests",

    "the power spectrum @xmath141 is perfectly the same as the traditionally normalized power spectrum ( see the coincidence of the solid lines and dot - dashed line ) .",

    ", the anti - correlation between the background and fluctuations becomes significant .",
    "8 shows that the wfc- sfc anti - correlation is stronger on scales @xmath215 and 9 ( 100 - 300 h@xmath155 kpc ) . in this scale range ,",
    "the self - normalized @xmath141 is generally larger than that given by traditional normalization , i.e. with a constant mean transmission . at @xmath216 ( @xmath217 140 h@xmath155 kpc ) ,",
    "the traditionally normalized power spectrum is lower than the self - normalized @xmath141 by a factor of 5.6 .    what does this difference indicate ?",
    "we know that the wfc - sfc anti - correlation is due to the intermittency of the field . in terms of fourier decomposition , an intermittent field means that the phases of the fourier modes is highly correlated , but the one point distribution of the fourier amplitude is still gaussian due to the central limit theorem .",
    "therefore , the wfc - sfc anti - correlation can be eliminated by a phase - randomization , which is produced by taking the inverse transform of the fourier coefficients of the original data after randomizing their phases uniformly over @xmath218 $ ] without changing their amplitudes .",
    "the phase randomized sample gets rid of the intermittent behavior possessed by the field , but the unnormalized power spectrum @xmath182 and the traditional normalized power spectrum of the phase randomized sample are exactly the same as the original one ( jamkhedkar , zhan & fang 2000 ; zhan , jamkhedkar & fang 2001 ) . in fig .",
    "7 , the long dashed line is the unnormalized power spectrum of the original data and its phase randomized counterpart , and the dot dashed line is the traditionally normalized power spectrum of the original data and its phase randomized counterpart .    therefore , neither unnormalized nor traditionally normalized power spectrum can distinguish between the highly intermittent field and its phase - randomized counterpart .",
    "on the other hand , the estimator eq.(41 ) can detect the difference between the two fields .",
    "we calculate the power spectrum of the phase randomized sample by the self - normalized estimator eq.(41 ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "it shows that the self - normalized power spectrum of the original data is very different from its phase - randomized counterpart .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the self - normalized power spectrum estimator is sensitive to both the clustering behaviors of the field on large scales ( mean transmission ) and on small scales ( intermittency , or fluctuation - background anti - correlation ) .",
    "but the traditional normalized power spectrum is insensitive to the phase correlation of the fourier modes .",
    "the power spectrum of ly@xmath0 forests is a direct indicator of the matter distribution at high redshift .",
    "this paper addresses the issue of how continuum fitting and the mean transmission affect the estimated power spectrum of qso s ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "we propose a straightforward method for calculating the power spectrum of observed ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "this method is based on the dwt decomposition of the transmission flux .",
    "it gives a consistent calculation for the decomposition of flux and the normalization of power spectrum .    with numerical simulation samples",
    ", we showed that the power spectrum obtained by this estimator is independent of the continuum .",
    "the non - linear power spectrum of the transmission can be reliably recovered from the observed flux regardless of the continuum , i.e. the algorithm can automatically take care of the normalization by the continuum without a continuum fitting .    with numerical simulation samples ,",
    "we also show that the power spectrum estimator can automatically consider the normalization of the mean transmission , i.e. the algorithm does nt need a pre - calculated mean transmission to do the normalization .    for a gaussian field ,",
    "the power spectrum given by the proposed estimator principally is the same as the power spectrum given by traditional normalization . in this case ,",
    "an advantage of the proposed estimator is that it is free from fitting parameters .    on scales with significant non - linear clustering , like intermittency or phase correlation",
