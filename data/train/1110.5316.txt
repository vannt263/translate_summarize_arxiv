    "since the discovery of iron - based superconductors,@xcite these materials have attracted great interests because of their complexity and possible unconventional superconductivity .",
    "they contain fe with local moment , exhibit interplay with spin density wave ( sdw ) state , multiband effects and possible s@xmath9 pairing.@xcite@xmath10@xcite among iron - based superconductors , recently discovered a@xmath1fe@xmath2ch@xmath3 ( a = k , rb , cs , tl , and ch = s , se , te , afech-122 type ) superconductorsguo have some unique characteristics .",
    "these include the proximity to an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) semiconducting state distinct from sdw , possible coexistence with long / short range afm order , considerable fe deficiencies in fe plane and the absence of hole pockets which are necessary for s@xmath9 pairing.@xcite@xmath10@xcite structurally , afech-122 materials are rather complex , i.e , they exhibit phase separation with superconducting and insulating regions.@xcite@xmath10@xcite insulating and superconducting state in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 crystals can be even tuned reversibly by post - annealing and quenching process,@xcite which is very rare in known superconductors .",
    "it implies that superconducting and insulating regions are intimately connected and could transform into each other .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to investigate the influence of post - annealing and quenching on the superconducting properties .    in this work , we report the anisotropy of the upper critical fields @xmath11 and thermally - activated flux flow ( taff ) of post - annealed and quenched k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 crystals .",
    "our results show that the anisotropy of @xmath12 increases with decreasing temperature , whereas the collective flux creep with point defects pinning source is important at high magnetic fields .",
    "crystal growth method and structure characterization of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 were reported elsewhere.@xcite the as - grown crystals were sealed into pyrex tube under vacuum ( @xmath13 10@xmath14 pa ) .",

    "1(a ) ) and the crossover temperature of metal - semiconductor transition shifts from about 134 k to 186 k. this is consistent with the results in the literature.@xcite on the other hand , quenching has a minor effect on superconducting transition temperature  @xmath18 which is about @xmath13 31 k for both samples as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "although the @xmath18s are similar for the as - grown and quenched samples , the quenched crystal exhibits a very sharp magnetic transition at zero - field - cooling curve and saturates at about 10 k whereas the diamagnetic signal increases gradually for the as - grown crystal ( fig .",
    "the calculated volume fraction at 1.8 k from dc magnetic susceptibility is increased after quenching.@xcite transport and magnetic results indicate that the post - annealing and quenching process significantly enhances the metallicity and superconducting volume fraction of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 crystals .     of quenched k@xmath21fe@xmath2se@xmath3 crystal in various fields up to 9 t for ( a ) h@xmath22c and ( b ) h@xmath22ab .",

    "3(b ) , the @xmath45 increases with decreasing temperature and @xmath59is about 3.6 at 26 k , which is consistent with the data on unquenched crystal.@xcite the @xmath45 determined from @xmath58 with 10% @xmath60 criterion also show same trend , but the temperature region is much higher and narrower , which is limited by the rather high @xmath61 .",

    "because @xmath81 = 0.5 and 1 correspond to a planar - defect pinning and a point - defect pinning , respectively,@xcite the fitted @xmath81 are close to 1 , suggesting that the vortex are mainly pinned by the collective point defects in the high field region .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental @xmath8 deviates from the extrapolated values in low field .",
    "the weaker field dependence of @xmath8 in low fields implies the crossover in vortex pinning mechanism and possibly entry in the single - vortex pinning region.@xcite it should be noted that the obtained @xmath8 are much larger than in fe(te , s ) and comparable to a polycrystalline smfeaso@xmath82f@xmath83 but still much smaller than in cuprates.@xcite@xmath10zhang    previous studies show that there is possible coexistence of superconducting and insulating regions in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 crystals.@xcite@xmath10@xcite post - annealing and quenching may enlarge the superconducting region and/or reduce insulating region , therefore decreasing the resistivity and improving the superconducting volume fraction of sample . on the other hand ,",
