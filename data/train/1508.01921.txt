    "the origin of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) has been one of the central issues of recent astrophysics .",
    "the main features of sne  ia have been firmly accounted for as a consequence of a thermonuclear explosion of a carbon - oxygen ( c+o ) white dwarf ( wd ) . both chandrasekhar",
    "mass and sub - chandrasekhar mass models have been presented (;",
    "@xcite ) . however , it is still not clear if the the wd accretes h / he - rich matter from its binary companion ( single degenerate ( sd ) scenario ) , or two c+o wds merge ( double degenerate ( dd ) scenario ) .",
    "observations provided some constraints on the nature of companion stars that may be considered as an indication of the occurrence of the sd scenario .",
    "these are the presence of circumstellar matter ( csm ) @xcite and the detection of hydrogen in the circumstellar - interaction - type sne  ( ia / iin ) , such as sn  2002ic @xcite and ptf11kx @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has been not possible to detect the presence of companions , e.g. , the lack of companion stars in the images of sn  2011fe @xcite , some sn  ia remnants ( snrs ) @xcite , sn 1572 ( tycho , @xcite ) , and sn 1006 @xcite .",
    "however , the above discussion does not take into account that the accreting wd should be rotating by getting the angular momentum from the accreting materials . @xcite and @xcite presented a spin - down scenario and suggested that there should exist a long spin - down phase of the rapidly rotating wd with a timescale of the angular momentum loss ( @xmath4-loss ) from the wd .",
    "if so , the donor star in the sd model may exhaust its hydrogen - rich envelope and become a he wd before the sn  ia explosion .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied close binary evolutions by taking into account the rotation of accreting wds and obtained the parameter space ( the companion s mass and the binary separation ) where the `` @xmath4-loss '' evolution actually occurs .",
    "the structure and evolution of rotating wds have been studied by many groups in 1d and 2d .    in the present study , we have constructed a new 1d stellar evolution code by taking into account rotation . in section  [ sec : methods ] we describe the ingredients of the models as well as the numerical techniques employed . with this code , we have calculated the final evolution of the mass - accreting wds by assuming that it rotates uniformly because of magnetic field coupling . by combining the close binary scenario @xcite",
    ", we have found that the wd evolves as follows , as it will be described in detail in section  [ sec : resultados ] .",
    "\\(1 ) for certain ranges of binary parameters , as it will be presented in section  [ sec : discu_conclu ] , the accretion rate ( @xmath5 ) always exceeds @xmath6 yr@xmath7 so that the wd increases its mass until it undergoes `` prompt '' carbon ignition .",
    "the mass of the uniformly rotating wd at the carbon ignition , @xmath8 , is larger for smaller @xmath5 . for @xmath9",
    "yr@xmath7 , @xmath10 1.43  @xmath11 , which is the largest mass because nova - like hydrogen flashes prevent the the wd mass from growing for the lower @xmath5 .",
    "because of the centrifugal force in the rotating wd , @xmath12 1.43  @xmath11 is larger than @xmath13 1.38  @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) for adjacent ranges of binary parameters (  [ sec : discu_conclu ] ) , the mass of the rotating wd exceeds @xmath13 1.38  @xmath11 but does not reach @xmath14 1.43  @xmath11 because of the decreasing accretion rate . in this letter",
    ", we shall present the evolution of the wd whose mass reaches 1.40  @xmath11 , being slightly below @xmath15 .",
    "after the accretion rate falls off , the wd undergoes the @xmath4-loss evolution .",
    "the exact mechanism and the timescale of the @xmath4-loss are highly uncertain , although we consider that the magneto - dipole braking wd to be responsible .",
    "we have found that @xmath4-loss induces the contraction of the wd , which leads to the `` delayed '' carbon ignition after the `` delay '' time due to neutrino and radiative cooling .",
    "we also studied how the carbon ignition depends on the strong screening factor , which still involves some uncertainties .",
    "then , we shall discuss whether the wd undergoes the sn ia explosion or collapse (  [ sec : resultados ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss our findings in section  [ sec : discu_conclu ] .",
    "we have employed the hydrostatic stellar evolution code described in @xcite , adapted to the case of accreting wds .",
    "the equation of state of degenerate electrons is treated as in @xcite , while coulomb corrections at finite temperature are included following @xcite .",
    "radiative opacities are taken from @xcite whereas conductive opacities were included following @xcite .",
    "neutrino emission processes are those described in @xcite .",
    "as stated above , in this letter we consider uniform rotation .",
    "for each isobar , we computed the parameter @xmath16 , defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the angular rotation , @xmath19 is the radius of a sphere with a volume equal to the corresponding isobar , and @xmath20 is the embraced mass . @xmath16 measures the fastness of rotation ; breakup rotation rate corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "let us define the average @xmath22 of an attribute @xmath23 on a given isobar as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the isobar surface and @xmath26 an element of it .",
    "in order to compute the structure of the rotating star , we need the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 that correct the standard structure equations for non - rotating objects",
    ". these are @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the effective gravitational acceleration , computed in the roche model approximation @xcite .",
    "when the wd is accreting , we impose the critical rotation regime for @xmath31 for the outermost layers .",
    "this provides the ( uniform ) rotation rate of the entire star .    for the mass accretion rate , we assume that @xmath5 is constant during the main accretion stage and then declines exponentially with an assumed timescale @xmath32  years ( set in order to mimic binary evolution ) since a moment chosen in order for the wd to reach an assumed final mass value @xmath33 . since @xmath34 yr@xmath7 , we also consider @xmath4-losses with another timescale @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the age at which @xmath38 yr@xmath7 .",
    "we have chosen this prescription to explore the reaction of the wd to @xmath4-losses without assuming a particular physical process , which at present is uncertain .",
    "for this reason , we shall treat @xmath35 as a free parameter .",
    "a possible mechanism leading to such losses is magneto - dipole braking ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for @xmath39",
    "we compute the rotation rate by considering the instantaneous moment of inertia of the oblate star . due to @xmath4-losses",
    ", @xmath16 falls down , although the wd may even rotate faster , leading to internal compression .    for the carbon - burning @xmath40c+@xmath40c reaction rate",
    ", we consider the expressions given in @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient is the screening of this reaction . here",
    ", we shall explore four different treatments , which are those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and .",
    "@xcite computed the enhancement factors of nuclear reaction rates due to interionic correlations within the linear - mixing ( lm ) approximation , where polarization of electrons was explicitly taken into account .",
    "more recently , claimed that the deviation @xmath41 from the lm approximation tends to reduce the enhancement factor significantly , but their formula ( 19 ) is wrong ; following their notations , the correct formula should read    @xmath42    where @xmath43 represents the deviation of the interaction free energy from the lm value for c - o - mg three - component plasma , with @xmath44 ( @xmath45=c , o , mg ) denoting their molar fractions .",
    "when this correct formula is adopted , @xmath41 turns out negligibly small under the present parameter conditions . for practical use",
    ", they also suggested a simple salpeter - van horn - type interpolation formula combined with the quantum correction , but we shall not use it here since it underestimates the reaction rates by one or two orders of magnitude near the freezing point , exhibiting large discrepancies with the pycnonuclear rates in the solid phase @xcite .",
    "we also note that @xcite and @xcite ignored the electron polarization effects .",
    "consequently , we shall consider the treatment by @xcite as the standard case and is the one employed unless stated otherwise .",
    "in this work , we restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath46 yr@xmath7 ; such material is burned in the outermost wd layers to c+o composition .",
    "the initial composition is of @xmath47 and heavier elements have solar abundances .",
    "we computed several evolutionary situations that depend on the binary parameters ( orbital period @xmath48  donor mass @xmath49 ) as shown in  [ sec : discu_conclu ] , stopping calculations before the onset of hydrodynamical stages of thermonuclear runaway ( log@xmath50 ; @xcite ) .",
    "\\(1 ) one is the case in which the wd accretes material continuously up to `` prompt '' carbon ignition . as described in ",
    "[ sec : introd ] , we obtained @xmath10 1.43  @xmath11 for @xmath51 yr@xmath7 .",
    "this is smaller than the carbon ignition mass of 1.48  @xmath11 obtained by @xcite because their 2d uniformly rotating model neglects the coulomb term in the equation of state .",
    "\\(2 ) we also consider a binary system in which the accretion rate declines and the wd reaches a final mass @xmath33 before carbon ignition ; in this work , we shall consider the case of @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath39 we apply @xmath4-losses as given in equation ( 4 ) with timescales of @xmath53  1 , 3 , 10 , 30 , 100 , 300 , and 1000  myr .",
    "as quoted above , @xmath4-loss processes are highly uncertain ; thus , we employ a wide range for @xmath35 to find the dependence of wd evolution with this parameter .",
    "the main results are presented in figures  [ fig : spin]-[fig : final_central ] .",
    "spin period for the presupernova evolution of a wd for the case of screening of carbon - burning reaction given by @xcite .",
    "the final mass is of 1.40  @xmath11 .",
    "accretion occurs for @xmath54  sec .",
    "each curve is labeled with its corresponding value of @xmath35 given in million years .",
    "although the star loses angular momentum exponentially , its moment of inertia decreases fast enough to make the star to spin up after the end of accretion .",
    "however , remarkably , the star does not overflow its critical rotation rate avoiding shedding mass .",
    "this is shown in the inset for the case of @xmath53  30  myr , where spin and critical spin period evolution are given as solid and dashed lines , respectively . ]    in figure  [ fig : spin ] , we show the evolution of the spin period @xmath55 for the presupernova evolution of a wd .",
    "accretion occurs for @xmath56  s. after the end of accretion , the wd loses angular momentum exponentially ( equation ( 4 ) ) . despite that",
    ", its moment of inertia decreases fast enough for the wd to _ spin up _ rather than spin down .",
    "we thus do not call such an evolution as `` spin down , '' rather just `` @xmath4-loss '' evolution .",
    "however , remarkably , the wd does not overflow the critical rotation rate avoiding shedding mass .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : spin ] for the case of @xmath53  30  myr .",
    "this is crucial for the delayed explosion scenario to work because a little mass loss would be enough to preclude the occurrence of the explosion . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath55 decreases ( i.e. , spin up rather than spin down ) up to a minimum value slightly before explosion ; however , @xmath16 decreases monotonically .    in figure  [ fig : all_central ] , we present the evolution of the center of the wd since before the end of accretion up to the onset of the hydrodynamical stage .",
    "thick black and thin red lines correspond to the strong screening factors given by @xcite and , respectively .",
    "the uppermost line corresponds to the case ( 1 ) evolution that leads to the `` prompt '' carbon ignition .",
    "below that , the lines from upper to lower correspond to the evolutions for @xmath53  1 , 3 , 10 , 30 , 100 , 300 , and 1000  myr , respectively , that lead to the `` delayed '' carbon ignition .    in figure",
    "[ fig : all_central ] , we also show the conditions at which neutrino losses equals nuclear energy release ( @xmath57 ) and those that indicate when the central entropy per baryon begins to increase @xmath58 , i.e. , carbon ignition .",
    "these curves are well detached because entropy per baryon starts to increases only when nuclear energy releases exceeds neutrino and conductive losses .",
    "conductive losses are comparatively more relevant the longer the @xmath35 because neutrino losses are more sensitive to temperature than conductive losses .    .",
    "[ fig : tc_evol ] ]    in figure  [ fig : tc_evol ] , we depict the evolution of the central temperature as a function of time for the cases included in figure  [ fig : spin ] .",
    "it is seen that for longer @xmath35 , the wd is cooler and takes longer time until the carbon ignition occurs .",
    "evolutionary tracks for the center of the wd during carbon ignition for the cases of @xmath53  3 and 100  myr .",
    "i , o , k , and pc correspond to the results employing the treatments for the screening given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and , respectively .",
    "arrows indicate the sense of the evolution . ]    in figure  [ fig : final_central ] , we present the evolutionary tracks for the center of the wd from the carbon ignition for the cases of @xmath53  3 and 100  myr for the four strong screening factors ( i , o , k , and pc ) given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and , respectively .",
    "note that ignition densities are not so different among the four factors .",
    "if @xmath59  gyr , the central temperature , and thus the rate of nuclear energy release , becomes so low that carbon is depleted before reaching the dynamical stage . due to electron",
    "capture , such a case could lead to collapse of the wd rather than explosion , although a detailed study of this phenomenon is necessary ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations presented above show that a c+o wd accreting enough material coming from a binary companion , rotating uniformly at the critical rate , and reaching a mass @xmath33 fulfilling @xmath60 ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) may indeed undergo delayed explosion . the above delay time is largely determined by the timescale of @xmath4-losses @xmath35 ( see figure  [ fig : tc_evol ] ) . for the values of @xmath35 considered here",
    ", the wd spends a time to undergo sn  ia explosion enough for the donor star to evolve to a structure completely different from the one it had when acted as a donor . for the red giant donor ,",
    "its h - rich envelope would be lost as a result of h - shell burning and mass loss so that it would become a he wd in @xmath62 10 myr . for the main - sequence donor",
    ", it would also evolve to become a low - mass he wd in 1 myr , a hot he wd in 10 myr , and a cold he wd in 1000 myr @xcite .",
    "so , the @xmath4-losses should delay the explosion in enough time for the former donor to be undetectable . therefore",
    ", this scenario provides a way to account for the failure in detecting companions to sne  ia .",
    "then , it is important to know for what binary systems the uniformly rotating wd effectively stops increasing its mass @xmath33 at @xmath63 and undergoes the delayed carbon ignition . we have calculated the binary evolution of the wd + companion star systems with the parameters of the initial orbital period @xmath48 and the companion mass @xmath49 for the several initial wd masses as in @xcite .",
    "the results for the initial wd mass of @xmath64 is shown in figure  [ fig : binary ] . here , the binary systems starting from the `` painted '' region of the ( @xmath65 ) plane reach @xmath66 , while the systems starting from the blank region encircled by the solid line reach @xmath67 .",
    "we estimate that the occurrence frequency of the delayed carbon ignition would roughly be one - third of the total frequency of the carbon ignition . the occurrence frequency is smaller than the estimate by @xcite , possibly because they adopted the mass range of the @xmath4-loss evolution as @xmath68 .",
    "outcome of the binary evolution of the wd + companion star systems is shown in the parameter space of the initial orbital period @xmath48 and the companion mass @xmath49 for the initial wd mass of @xmath64 .",
    "the mass @xmath33 of the wd starting from the `` painted '' region reaches @xmath66 ( delayed carbon ignition ) , while the systems starting from the blank region encircled by the solid line reach @xmath69 ( prompt carbon ignition ) . ]",
    "while here we have restricted ourselves to present results corresponding to the case of wds that reach a mass of 1.40  @xmath11 with @xmath70 yr@xmath7 , we have explored this scenario for other final masses and accretion rates .",
    "we found that the overall evolution of the objects is qualitatively the same if the final wd mass is close enough to @xmath71 .",
    "while we did not attempt to determine the lowest - mass value for ignition to occur , we found that models with 1.37  @xmath11 do not ignite , while those with 1.38  @xmath11 explode .",
    "this is consistent with the adopted value of @xmath72 .",
    "we explored different screening theories for the carbon - burning reaction finding that there is an uncertainty in the ignition density of @xmath73 .",
    "remarkably , ignition ( defined as the moment at which entropy per baryon of matter at the center of the star begins to increase ) occurs at a density significantly higher than the one at which nuclear energy release equals neutrino losses .",
    "this is due to conductive losses , especially important for the case of large @xmath35 values for which the wd interior is cool .",
    "carbon burning forms a convective core , which leads to the occurrence of the convective urca process ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present study , we do not take into account this process , assuming that it does not suppress the heating by carbon burning .",
    "after the thermonuclear runaway , the central region would reach nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) and undergo electron capture at higher densities than in the non - rotating wd @xcite as well as the prompt ignition .",
    "this would lead to the synthesis of more neutron - rich fe - peak elements , such as @xmath74fe , @xmath75fe , and @xmath76ni .",
    "it would be important to study such nucleosynthesis in multi - dimensional simulation of convective deflagration , because the results would be sensitive to the treatment of turbulent flame .",
    "the nucleosynthesis results should be compared with observational signatures of sne ia .",
    "for example , the emission lines observed in the spectra of the nebular phase of sne ia indicate the existence of a large amount of stable fe and ni .",
    "@xcite estimated the amount of stable fe is @xmath77 for most of normal sne ia ( see also @xcite for sn 2011fe ) .",
    "if such an amount of stable fe is mostly @xmath74fe and those sne ia are powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath78 @xmath75ni , the ratio of @xmath74fe/@xmath75fe in the ejecta of those sne ia is @xmath79 times larger than the solar ratio .",
    "this suggests that the stable fe is mostly @xmath75fe rather than @xmath74fe , which would be realized for lower @xmath80 , i.e. , at the higher central density than the prompt ignition model ( such as w7 in @xcite ) .",
    "lower @xmath80 in the delayed carbon burning might also be consistent with the large amount of mn and ( stable ) ni are observed in the sn  ia remnants @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank n. itoh and s. ogata for useful comments on the strong screening factor .",
