    "it turned out that there is an invariant poisson structure for the pentagram map and it has sufficiently many invariant quantities .",
    "moreover , this map turned out to be related to a variety of mathematical domains , including cluster algebras @xcite , frieze patterns , and integrable systems of mathematical physics : in particular , its continuous limit in 2d is the classical boussinesq equation @xcite .",
    "integrability of the pentagram map for 2d closed polygons was established in @xcite , while a more general framework related to surface networks was presented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the definition of the pentagram map to closed and twisted polygons in spaces of any dimension @xmath1 and prove its various integrability properties .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the problem of finding integrable higher - dimensional generalizations for the pentagram map attracted much attention after the 2d case was treated in @xcite .. indeed , the initial polytope should be simple for its diagonal hyperplanes to be well defined . in order to iterate the pentagram map",
    "the dual polytope has to be simple as well .",
    "thus iterations could be defined only for @xmath1-simplices , which are all projectively equivalent . ]",
    "the main difficulty in higher dimensions is that diagonals of a polygon are generically skew and do not intersect .",
    "one can either confine oneself to special polygons ( e.g. , corrugated ones , @xcite ) to retain the intersection property or one has too many possible choices for using hyperplanes as diagonals , where it is difficult to find integrable ones , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "below , as an analog of the 2d shortest diagonals for a generic polygon in a projective space @xmath5 we propose to consider a  short - diagonal hyperplane \" passing through @xmath1 vertices where every other vertex is taken starting with a given one .",
    "then a new vertex is constructed as the intersection of @xmath1 consecutive diagonal hyperplanes .",

    "@xmath6 takes the initial polygon to the one defined by this set of new vertices .",
    "as before , the obtained polygon is considered modulo projective equivalence in @xmath5 .",
    "we also describe general pentagram maps @xmath7 in @xmath5 enumerated by two integral parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 by considering @xmath8-diagonals ( i.e. , hyperplanes passing through every @xmath8th vertex of the polygon ) and by taking the intersections of every @xmath9th hyperplane like that .",
    "there is a curious duality between them : the map @xmath7 is equal to @xmath10 modulo a shift in vertex indices .",
    "however , we are mostly interested in the higher pentagram maps , which correspond to @xmath11 in @xmath5 .",
    "we start by describing the continuous limit of the higher pentagram map as the evolution in the direction of the  envelope \" for such a sequence of short - diagonal planes as the number of vertices of the polygon tends to infinity .",
    "( more precisely , the envelope here is the curve whose osculating planes are limits of the short - diagonal planes . )    ( * = theorems [ evolution - anyd ] , [ thm : kdv ] * ) [ thm : cont - lim ] the continuous limit of the higher pentagram map in @xmath5 is the @xmath2-equation in the kdv hierarchy , which is an infinite - dimensional completely integrable system .",
    "this generalizes the boussinesq equation as a limit of the pentagram map in @xmath12 and this limit seems to be very robust .",
    "indeed , the same equation appears for an almost arbitrary choice of diagonal planes .",
    "it also arises when instead of osculating planes one considers other possible definitions of higher pentagram maps ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the pentagram map in the above definition with short - diagonal hyperplanes exhibits integrability properties not only in the continuous limit , but as a discrete system as well . to study them",
    ", we define two coordinate systems for twisted polygons in 3d ( somewhat similar to the ones used in 2d , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and present explicit formulas for the 3d pentagram map using these coordinates ( see theorem [ explicit ] ) .",
    "then we describe the pentagram map as a completely integrable discrete dynamical system by presenting its lax form in any dimension and studying in detail the 3d case ( see section [ sect : alg - geo ] ) . for algebraic - geometric integrability",
    "we complexify the pentagram map .",
    "the corresponding 2d case was investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of the algebraic - geometric integrability for a discrete dynamical system is a discrete lax ( or zero curvature ) equation with a spectral parameter , which in our case assumes the following form : @xmath13 here the index @xmath14 represents the discrete time variable , the index @xmath15 refers to the vertex of an @xmath16-gon , and @xmath17 is a complex spectral parameter .",
    "( for the pentagram map in @xmath18 the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are matrix - valued of size @xmath21 . )",
    "the discrete lax equation arises as a compatibility condition of an over - determined system of equations : @xmath22 for an auxiliary function @xmath23 .",
    "recall that for a smooth dynamical system the lax form is a differential equation of type @xmath24 $ ] on a matrix @xmath25 .",
    "such a form of the equation implies that the evolution of @xmath25 changes it to a similar matrix , thus preserving its eigenvalues .",
    "if the matrix @xmath25 depends on a parameter , @xmath26 , then the corresponding eigenvalues as functions of parameter do not change and in many cases provide sufficiently many first integrals for complete integrability of such a system .",

    ", the equivalence of formulas for the pentagram map to the dynamics defined by the lax equation implies complete algebraic - geometric integrability of the system .",
    "more precisely , the following theorem summarizes several main results on the 3d pentagram map , which are obtained by studying its lax equation .",
    "the dynamics is ( generically ) defined on the space @xmath32 of projectively equivalent twisted @xmath16-gons in 3d , which we describe below , and has dimension @xmath33 , while closed @xmath16-gons form a submanifold of codimension 15 in it .    later on we will introduce the notion of spectral data which consists of a riemann surface , called a spectral curve , and a point in the jacobian ( i.e. , the complex torus ) of this curve , as well as a notion of a spectral map between the space @xmath32 and the spectral data .",
    "( * = theorems [ spectral - th1 ] , [ time - evol ] , [ thm : closed ] * ) a zariski open subset of the complexified space @xmath32 of twisted @xmath16-gons in 3d is a fibration whose fibres are zariski open subsets of tori .",
    "these tori are jacobians of the corresponding spectral curves and are invariant with respect to the space pentagram map .",
    "their dimension is @xmath34 for odd @xmath16 and @xmath35 for even @xmath16 , where @xmath36 is the integer part of @xmath37 .",
    "the pentagram dynamics on the jacobians goes along a straight line for odd @xmath16 and along a staircase for even @xmath16 ( i.e. , the discrete evolution is either a constant shift on a torus , or its square is a constant shift ) .    for closed @xmath16-gons",
    "the tori have dimensions @xmath38 for odd @xmath16 and @xmath39 for even @xmath16 .",
    "one also has an explicit description of the the above fibration in terms of coordinates on the space of @xmath16-gons .",
    "we note that the pentagram dynamics understood as a shift on complex tori does not prevent the corresponding orbits on the space @xmath32 from being unbounded .",
    "the dynamics described above takes place for generic initial data , i.e. , for points on the jacobians whose orbits do not intersect certain divisors .",
    "points of generic orbits with irrational shifts can return arbitrarily close to such divisors . on the other hand",
    ", the inverse spectral map is defined outside of these special divisors and may have poles there .",
    "therefore the sequences in the space @xmath32 corresponding to such orbits may escape to infinity .",
    "it is known that the pentagram map in 2d possesses an invariant poisson structure @xcite , which can also be described by using the krichever - phong universal formula @xcite .",
    "although we do not present an invariant poisson structure for the pentagram map in 3d , we describe its symplectic leaves , as well as the action - angle coordinates .",
    "more precisely , we present an invariant symplectic structure ( i.e. , a closed non - degenerate 2-form ) , and submanifolds where it is defined ( theorem [ thm : rank ] ) . by analogy with the 2d case , it is natural to suggest that these submanifolds are symplectic leaves of an invariant poisson structure , and that the inverse of our symplectic structure coincides with the poisson structure on the leaves .",
    "an explicit description of this poisson structure in 3d is still an open problem .",
    "note that the algebraic - geometric integrability of the pentagram map implies its arnold  liouville complete integrability on generic symplectic leaves ( in the real case ) .",
    "namely , the existence of a ( pre)symplectic structure coming from the lax form of the pentagram map ( see section [ s : lax - sform ] ) , together with the generic set of first integrals , appearing as coefficients of the corresponding spectral curve , provides sufficiently many integrals in involution .",
    "( note that proving independence of first integrals while remaining within the real setting is often more difficult than first proving the algebraic - geometric integrability , which in turn implies their independence in the real case . )    finally , in section  [ s : higher - lax ] we present a lax form for the pentagram maps in arbitrary dimension ( which implies their complete integrability ) assuming their scaling invariance :    ( * = theorem [ thm : lax_anyd ] * ) the scale - invariant pentagram map in @xmath18 admits a lax representation with a spectral parameter .",
    "the scaling invariance of the pentagram maps is proved for all @xmath40 , with some numerical evidence for higher values of @xmath41 as well .",
    "it would be interesting to establish it in full generality .",
    "there is a considerable difference between the cases of even and odd dimension @xmath1 , which can be already seen in the analysis of the 2d and 3d cases .",
