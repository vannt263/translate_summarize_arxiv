    "diffractive ( coherent ) production of hadron states in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering is a new kind of hard process calculable in qcd .",
    "it provides the unique possibility to study the properties of vacuum exchange in qcd as well as the interplay between soft ( nonperturbative ) and hard ( perturbative ) contributions to the pomeron .",
    "one of the main aimes of such research is to obtain a three dimensional image of a hadron as compared to the one dimensional images extracted from the usual deep inelastic scattering off hadrons and nuclei .",
    "the idea to use diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons to investigate color coherence effects has been suggested many years ago in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the cross sections of hard diffractive processes off a proton target are proportional to the square of the gluon distribution in the proton .",
    "recently , brodsky et al .",
    "@xcite derived within the leading @xmath3 approximation a qcd prediction for the diffractive production of vector mesons built of light flavors in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "diffractive photo- and electroproduction of @xmath4 mesons has been calculated by m.ryskin @xcite within the bfkl approximation of pqcd and within the charmonium constituent quark model approximation for the light - cone wave function of the @xmath4 meson .    on the experimental side ,",
    "first hera results on @xmath5-meson production at @xmath6 gev@xmath7 @xcite and on photoproduction of @xmath4 mesons @xcite have confirmed the fast increase of the cross section with energy predicted by pqcd .    in this paper , we extend the qcd analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite in several directions .",
    "we explain that the formulae of ref .",
    "@xcite are valid within the conventional leading @xmath8 approximation .",
    "so the cross section for hard diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons is expressed through the conventional leading @xmath9 order gluon distribution , and not by means of its asymptotics within leading order in @xmath10 as in ref .",
    "this calculation justifies using the lo qcd improved parton model densities to compare qcd predictions for the electroproduction of vector mesons with experimental data .",
    "we analyze the average transverse sizes of the @xmath11 components effective in @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and in @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and find them to decrease strongly with increasing @xmath1 . at @xmath16 gev@xmath7 ,",
    "those sizes are comparatively close , @xmath17 fm , while at larger @xmath1 the rate of decrease of this average size is larger for @xmath13 .",
    "thus we argue that the current @xmath16 gev@xmath7 data suggest that the measured radius of the color distribution within a meson is @xmath18 fm .",
    "this observation justifies the application of pqcd for the calculation of hard diffractive electroproduction of longitudinally polarized vector mesons .",
    "really , the screening of the color charges insures the smallness of the effective interaction due to asymptotic freedom . in the case of @xmath19 , the effective transverse size of the @xmath11 components",
    "is expected to be intermediate between those in @xmath12 and those in photoproduction because the contribution of soft qcd is enhanced for @xmath19 .",
    "also , the significant difference between @xmath13 and @xmath15 indicates that substantial next - to - leading order corrections should be present in diffractive vector meson photo- and electroproduction which , in turn , should lead to a change of the scale effective in the gluon density .",
    "we show that the qcd prediction for the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath5-meson production cross section is substantially weaker than that given by the naive dimensional estimate of @xmath20 as a result of the increase of the parton distributions due to @xmath1 evolution @xcite .",
    "we find also a further slowing down of the @xmath1 dependence due to the transverse quark motion in the vector mesons .",
    "account of both effects resolves , to a large extent , seeming contradictions of predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite with the @xmath1 dependence of the cross section of the zeus data @xcite .",
    "thus , investigation of the @xmath1 dependence of the cross section of electroproduction of vector mesons may turn out to be an effective method to probe the three dimensional distribution of color in hadrons .",
    "we analyze the energy and @xmath1 dependence of the restoration of @xmath21 flavor symmetry in the electroproduction of vector mesons built of different flavors .",
    "we find that the ratio of the yields of @xmath22- and @xmath5-meson production should increase with increasing @xmath1 and/or @xmath23 .",
    "we explain also that , in hard diffractive processes , @xmath24 flavor symmetry should be violated in the opposite way as compared to the low energy regime ",
    "production of heavy flavors should be enhanced at sufficiently large @xmath1 . to analyze the onset of the restoration of @xmath24 flavor symmetry",
    ", we evaluate diffractive photo- and electroproduction of @xmath4 and @xmath25 mesons within the charmonium model approximation to the light - cone wave function of the @xmath4 and @xmath25 mesons , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and find that account of the quark fermi motion leads to a significant additional suppression of @xmath4 photoproduction by a factor @xmath26 as compared to the asymptotic estimate , and to a slowing down of the onset of the asymptotic regime .",
    "comparison with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite on @xmath4 photoproduction shows that the pqcd predictions can be brought to agree with the data within the uncertainties in the gluon distribution of a nucleon .",
    "we explain also that the charmonium models differ from qcd for large @xmath1",
    ". we furthermore present estimates for the yields of excited vector meson states in diffractive processes , @xmath27 .",
    "the interesting new effect , specific for qcd , is that the relative yield of excited states should increase with increasing @xmath28 and/or @xmath1 .    towards the end of the paper",
    ", we estimate the boundary of the kinematical region where , at very small @xmath2 , the fast increase of the cross section with decreasing @xmath2 should slow down and where existing methods of hard pqcd seem to be insufficient .",
    "we deduce the constraint on the kinematical range of applicability of the leading logarithm approximations and/or on the increase of the cross sections of hard processes with energy .",
    "we discuss practical consequences of this constraint and present model estimates for nuclear shadowing of the gluon distribution and of the diffractive vector meson electroproduction in interactions with heavy nuclei .",
    "these effects should be significant in kinematics which can be probed at colliding electron - nuclear beams at hera and in the lhc heavy ion experiments .",
    "diffractive photo- and electroproduction of vector mesons has been investigated recently in refs .",
    "@xcite within the constituent quark model based on the two - gluon - exchange approximation @xcite .",
    "some of the predictions of that model  like the decrease of the effective size of the vector mesons with increasing @xmath1 @xcite or a significant production of @xmath29 mesons @xcite  resemble results obtained in this paper .",
    "other predictions  as the dip in the @xmath29 meson production at small @xmath1 suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite or the qualitative difference between the behavior of radial and orbital ( e.g. @xmath30-state ) excitations  do not follow from the qcd formulae of ref . @xcite and the current paper .    at the same time , we want to emphasize that at sufficiently large @xmath1 , where a qcd calculation can be substantiated , the cross section should be expressed through the distribution of bare quarks in the vector meson and the parton distributions within the target @xcite but not through the distribution of constituent quarks as in the models of refs .",
    "there exists no direct relationship between the minimal fock component of the light - cone hadron wave function , which enters in the qcd formulae for hard processes , and the wave functions of the constituent quark model .",
    "for example , the minimal fock component of the quark - gluon wave function of vector mesons should decrease at large @xmath31 as a power of @xmath31 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) but not like a gaussian as used in refs .",
    "just this difference is responsible for relevant effects found in the current work which are due to the transverse quark fermi motion in the diffractively produced vector mesons .",

    "the idea behind the calculation of hard diffractive processes is that , when the coherence length , @xmath39 , exceeds the diameter of the target , @xmath40 , the virtual photon transforms into a hadron component well before reaching the target and the final vector meson @xmath37 is formed well past the target .",
    "the hadronic configuration of the final state is then the result of a coherent superposition of all those hadronic fluctuations , @xmath41 , in the photon wave function whose masses satisfy the condition : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the minimal momentum transferred to the target : @xmath44    thus , as in the more familiar leading twist deep inelastic processes , the calculation should take into account all possible diffractively produced intermediate hadronic states satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the use of completeness over those states allows us to express the result in terms of quark and gluon distributions , as in the case of other hard processes .",
    "the matrix element of electroproduction of a vector meson can thus be written as a convolution of the light - cone wave function of the photon , @xmath45 , the scattering amplitude of the hadron state , @xmath46 , and the wave function of the vector meson , @xmath47 : @xmath48 in the case of a longitudinally polarized photon with sufficiently large @xmath1 , the sum over intermediate states @xmath41 is a @xmath49 pair .",
    "this can be demonstrated by transition into impact parameter space and by showing that the essential distances , @xmath50 , between the quarks in the wave function of the photon are @xmath51 .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different , however , for a transversely polarized photon due to the singular behavior of the vertex @xmath52 when one of the partons carries a small fraction of the photon momentum . in this case ,",
    "soft and hard physics compete in a wide range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    within the leading logarithmic approximation ,",

    "@xmath68 can be inferred from the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , which were performed in the leading @xmath69 approximation of pqcd using certain input from hadronic quark models .",
    "also , a quantity which can be related to @xmath68 has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the leading @xmath69 approximation of pqcd while making specific assumptions on the parton structure of the constituent quarks .",
    "the upper bound of the @xmath2-range of applicability of eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is dictated by the condition that the formation time parameter should be much greater than the interaction time , which corresponds to the requirement that the longitudinal coherence length is larger than the target s diameter : @xmath70    eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) can be easily generalized to the somewhat less restrictive leading @xmath71 approximation .",
    "derivation of the respective formulae is relatively simple for hard diffractive processes initiated by longitudinally polarized photons because longitudinally polarized photons produce quarks in a plc ( point - like configuration ) only .",
    "it can be demonstrated by transition into impact parameter space that the essential distances , @xmath50 , between the quarks in the wave function of a longitudinally polarized photon with virtuality @xmath1 are @xmath72 . using @xmath50 as the small parameter , it is easy to determine which feynman diagrams dominate for the hard diffractive process .",
    "it is important to note that the integral over the distance between the quarks produced by the longitudinally polarized photon does not lead to terms proportional to @xmath73 in the evaluation of the box diagrams .",
    "so the whole contribution is concentrated at small @xmath50 . as a result ,",
    "the factorization / decoupling theorem of qcd can be applied to factorize the hard part of the amplitude .",
    "so , to calculate the amplitude in the leading @xmath8 approximation , we need to accurately evaluate the hard blobe and then convolute it with the parton distributions .",
    "the hard blobe is described by the feynman diagrams in figs .",
    "1a and 1b , where gluons are attached to the quark box diagram",
    ".    direct calculation of the sum of feynman diagrams for the @xmath74 transition of figs .",
    "1a and 1b where only two gluons couple to the hard blobe ",
    "although all interactions of these two gluons with the target are included  leads to seemingly the same formulae as in ref .",
    "really it is easy to demonstrate that within the leading @xmath75 approximation , which is equivalent to the leading @xmath76 approximation , the dominant contribution is given by the diagrams with exchange of longitudinally polarized gluons .",
    "the diagrams corresponding to the exchange of transversely polarized gluons and those due to the quark sea in the nucleon are suppressed at small @xmath2 . for a detailed discussion",
    "@xcite .",
    "the major difference from @xcite is that , within the approximation discussed above , the full gluon distribution in the target calculated within the leading @xmath77 approximation should be used . in the formulae of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , @xmath66 is the gluon structure function calculated within the leading @xmath78 approximation .",
    "remember , however , that corrections of powers @xmath79 are numerically small and negative @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath80 is the gluon s transverse momentum within the `` pomeron '' .    in principle",
    ", the nondiagonal gluon distribution enters into those formulae .",
    "it will be explained in the next section that the usual parton distribution in the target @xmath81 is a reasonable approximation to this nondiagonal density . for a better understanding of the definition of the nondiagonal parton densities , these formulae",
    "should be compared to a similar one for the total photoabsorption cross section off a target @xmath81 : @xmath82 eq .",

    "( [ al ] ) can be neglected for the production of vector mesons built of light quarks , since effectively @xmath91 .",
    "this is because the wave function of the vector mesons decreases comparatively fastly with @xmath31 up to the onset of the pqcd regime .",
    "this explains why it is a reasonable approximation in @xmath84  but not in eq .",
    "( [ sigmat ] )  to pull the parton densities at @xmath92 out of the integrand .",
    "the respective hard cross sections can be easily calculated through the miminal fock components of the wave function of the vector meson .",
    "thus , we deduce our asymptotic expression for the cross section of the electroproduction of vector mesons : @xmath93 the factor @xmath94 accounts for preasymptotic effects , i.e. , @xmath95 , see the discussion in sect .",
    "the major practical difference between the formulas deduced within the leading @xmath96 and the leading @xmath97 approximation ( i.e. , within the evolution equation ) is that , in the leading @xmath98 approximation , @xmath66 should be interpreted as the conventional parton distribution .",
    "the formal derivation of the pqcd expressions for the cross sections of hard diffractive processes in terms of the parton distributions in the target consists of several steps .",
    "the first is to demonstrate that , at small @xmath2 , it is legitimate to use completeness over hadronic states to express the amplitude in terms of hard interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "we discussed this in the previous subsection .",
    "the second step is to prove that the process is really hard and that it is legitimate to apply the qcd factorization theorem , and the third step is to show that the nondiagonal parton distributions of the target can be approximated through the conventional parton densities .      to better understand the issue of applicability of pqcd to the process ( [ eq1 ] ) , it is convenient to perform the fourier transform of the amplitude into the impact parameter space of the @xmath11 pair , which leads to @xmath99 here , the sudakov variable @xmath88 denotes the fraction of the photon momentum carried by one of the quarks , @xmath50 is the transverse distance between the quark and antiquark within the photon , and @xmath100 is the color - dipole cross section of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) off a nucleon target .",
    "the advantages of the description of high energy processes in terms of light - cone wave functions of bound states in the impact parameter representation has been understood long ago ( cf .",
    "h.cheng and t.t.wu @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "( [ brep ] ) we approximate @xmath103 by @xmath104 this form accounts for the common wisdom of the @xmath88 dependence of the wave function of a longitudinally polarized vector meson , while the @xmath89 dependence is chosen at large @xmath89 corresponds to even smaller interquark distances in the wave function of the longitudinally polarized photon . ] to be @xmath105 .",
    "the parameter @xmath106 is related to the average transverse momentum of a quark / antiquark within the @xmath11 component of the meson s wave function through @xmath107 . in our numerical analysis",
    ", we vary @xmath108 between 300 and 600 mev / c .",
    "our guess is that , in reality , @xmath109 should be of the order of @xmath110 mev / c , which is somewhat larger than the partons average transverse momenta in hadrons . this is because , from the whole set of fock components of the hadron wave function , the overlap with the wave function of the @xmath90 emphasizes the component which has no soft gluon field .",
    "an analysis of the energy denominators relevant for the wave functions of vector mesons shows that , in order to avoid a spurious pole , the @xmath11 component s energy denominator may dominate only in the kinematics @xmath111 this condition is restrictive only for the minimal fock space component . when the number of constituents is large , the energy denominator is large more or less automatically",
    "now we need @xmath112 .",
    "we estimate it based on the impact parameter representation for @xmath113 , @xmath114 the nucleon s total longitudinal photoabsorption cross section , where @xmath115 in the derivation of this equation , to simplify the estimates , we again pulled out the parton distributions in the mean point @xmath2 .",
    "we perform the analysis in two steps .",
    "first we use eq .",
    "( [ sigmabb ] ) and neglect the dependence of @xmath116 on @xmath117 to estimate an average @xmath118 for this process .",
    "the latter we define as the value of @xmath50 up to which we have to integrate to saturate 50% of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ sigmal ] ) .",
    "we then identify @xmath119 , determine a new average @xmath118 , and then iterate this procedure to self - consistency .",
    "the final result of @xmath118 for @xmath113 obtained in this manner is plotted as a solid curve in fig .",
    "2 .    thus , approximately @xmath120 or @xmath121 for @xmath122 . for fixed @xmath1 , the transverse size @xmath118 slowly decreases with decreasing @xmath2 :",
    "between @xmath123 and @xmath124 it drops by about @xmath125 . the above reasoning accounts for some of the next to leading order @xmath126 effects , based on the intuitive idea that the interaction is determined mostly by the spacial region occupied by color .",
    "note that a numerically similar result was obtained by nikolaev and zakharov @xcite in a consideration of @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "however , in the derivation of the quantity @xmath130 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding integrals were actually dominated by large @xmath50 s for which it is not clear whether the expression for the color - dipole cross section of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) is at all applicable . besides",
    ", no @xmath2-dependence of their @xmath130 was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "then we use this value of @xmath118 to calculate the average transverse distances , @xmath131 , relevant for longitudinal @xmath5-meson production .",
    "the results of such a calculation for @xmath132 and 600 mev / c are presented also in fig .",
    "2 . one can see that @xmath133 is quite small , however its numerical value is rather sensitive to the average value of @xmath109 .",
    "we observe also that @xmath134 .",
    "this difference may be rather small for @xmath135 gev@xmath7 , but it becomes significant for @xmath136 gev@xmath7 .",
    "note that the values we find for @xmath133 are substantialy smaller than the typical distances between the valence quarks in a meson , @xmath137 fm .",
    "so , color is sufficiently screened within the wave function of the produced vector meson , and asymptotic freedom can be used to justify the applicability of pqcd for the calculation of diffractive electroproduction of @xmath5-mesons at @xmath138 gev@xmath7 .    our results for the elementary color - dipole cross section of a small size @xmath49 pair with a nucleon target , @xmath139 of eq .",
    "( [ sigmabb ] ) , are depicted in fig . 3 for the grv94 parametrization @xcite of the nucleon s gluon density and for various values of @xmath2 .",
    "as expected , the cross section rises approximately quadratically with @xmath50 and it increases dramatically with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "note , however , that only for the smallest @xmath2 , the cross section @xmath139 approaches normal hadronic values ( @xmath140 mb ) . however , for such @xmath2 , it reaches those already at quite small values of @xmath50 , which , in turn , hints a limit of applicability of the leading logarithm approximations discussed here .",
    "this will be discussed further in sect .",
    "results for an analogous evaluation of the average transverse distances relevant for the photo- and electroproduction of charmonium mesons are depicted in fig .",
    ", we employed nonrelativistic charmonium wave functions calculated from a power - law @xcite and a logarithmic potential @xcite , which both describe @xmath141 reasonably well , and we set @xmath142 .",
    "this yields @xmath143 , with @xmath144 , for the wave function of the @xmath145 component of the ( virtual ) photon .",
    "note , however , that at sufficiently large @xmath1  which is the only domain at which the formulae for any vector meson production can be consistently proven in qcd  @xmath146 due to the @xmath1 evolution @xcite , which is qualitatively different from the behavior expected for the nonrelativistic charmonium wave functions .",
    "the question which arises is thus whether hard physics is applicable at smaller @xmath1 , and so we are effectively analyzing physics hidden under the assumption that the nonrelativistic charmonium wave functions approximate the light - cone wave function .    we observe that for @xmath4 photoproduction the corresponding relevant distances , @xmath147 , are similar to the average interquark distances in the @xmath4 mesons ( @xmath148 fm ) , while for the photoproduction of the excited state , the @xmath25 , the distances that are most relevant for the photoproduction process are significantly smaller than the respective average interquark separations ( @xmath149 fm ) . within the charmonium model approximation for the light - cone wave function of the @xmath25 meson ,",
    "this is due to the nodal structure of the wave function of the @xmath25 , as was also observed by benhar et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the two - gluon - exchange model @xcite .",
    "however , for charmonium electroproduction at larger @xmath1 , the distances relevant in the amplitude are much smaller than the average interquark separations in the charmonium mesons .",
    "we can now also estimate the contribution of the hard blobe to the @xmath54 dependence of the vector meson electroproduction cross section . in detail",
    ", we fit @xmath150 by an exponential at the vicinity of @xmath151 .",
    "the slope parameter that we find , @xmath152 gev@xmath153 , is much smaller than , e.g. , the experimentally observed slope , @xmath154 gev@xmath153 @xcite , of the @xmath5-production cross section off the nucleon . hence , for all current practical considerations , the hard blobe does not contribute significantly to the @xmath54 dependence of the cross section , which hence originates almost entirely from the target s two - gluon form factor , @xmath155 , and which is thus expected to be universal for all hard processes driven by the gluon density .    in the case of a transversely polarized @xmath156 , the contribution of large @xmath50 , where nonperturbative qcd effects are dominant , is not suppressed .",
    "those contributions arise from very asymmetric @xmath49 pairs with @xmath157 or @xmath158 @xcite , and , for transverse polarizations , in the integrand of the amplitude the regions @xmath88 or @xmath159 thus give important contributions , which are usually suppressed at large @xmath1 by a sudakov type form factor .",
    "in fact , it is easy to check that , for the case of transversely polarized photons , the contribution of this regions to the asymptotic expressions contains a logarithmic divergency .",
    "hence , in this case , the integral over transverse momenta does not decouple .    on the other hand , the increase of @xmath160 at small @xmath2 works towards enhancing the perturbative contribution of small @xmath50 in this case as well .",
    "this is because the contribution of quark configurations with small @xmath50 increases faster with decreasing @xmath2 than the contribution from soft qcd . at what @xmath2 and @xmath1 the pqcd regime will dominate for reactions initiated by a @xmath161",
    "is an open question since the contributions from soft qcd are not under control in this case .",
    "currently , we are nethertheless estimating the hard , perturbative contribution to @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the formulae in this paper were deduced in the leading @xmath163 approximation only , there is an uncertainty in the theoretical formulae whether the gluon distributions should be evaluated at @xmath1 or say at @xmath164 . a similar problem exists for calculations of the leading twist contribution to the total dis cross section within the leading @xmath163 approximation . note , also , that the substantial difference between @xmath165 and @xmath166 which we found in this subsection indicates that significant next - to - leading order corrections should be present in diffractive vector meson photo- and electroproduction",
    ". we will give phenomenological estimates of these effects in sects .",
    "iv.c and v.      in this subsection , we show that the nondiagonal parton distributions of the target can be expressed through the diagonal  conventional  parton densities .",
    "the first observation is that the momentum transfered to the target , @xmath167 , is negligible .",
    "a more important issue is that the difference between the masses of the virtual photon and the vector meson leads to a difference between the light - cone fractions of the target momenta in the initial ( @xmath168 ) and final ( @xmath169 ) states . to elucidate this point ,",
    "let us consider diffractive vector meson electroproduction in the center of mass of the @xmath170 system .",
    "suppose the initial target has momentum @xmath171 .",
    "kinematical considerations show that the final target has momentum @xmath172 , and thus the difference between @xmath168 and @xmath169 is @xmath2 @xcite .    for the hard part of the diffractive amplitude , the dependence on fractions of the target momentum carried by the interacting partons in the initial and final states is calculable in pqcd .",
    "this simplification arises since in the kinematics of diffractive processes , which dominate in the considered diagrams , it is legitimate to neglect in the propagators of the exchanged particles the contribution of the longitudinal part of their momenta as compared to the contribution of the transverse components .",
    "this can be easily proven within the @xmath163 and/or @xmath173 approximation by direct evaluation of the leading feynman diagrams . in reality , this argument is valid beyond the pqcd regime since it explores specifics of multipheripheral and multiregge kinematics .",
    "thus , we conclude that the initial and final parton wave functions of the target practically coincide , and it is a reasonable numerical approximation to use the diagonal parton densities . this question will be considered in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we have explained that the tiny momentum transfered to the target does not influence the hard blobe , which is specific for small @xmath2 physics .",
    "the calculation discussed above is applicable at suffiently large @xmath1 , i.e. , only when the transverse momenta in the @xmath49 pair are neglected , can the cross section for electroproduction of longitudinally polarized vector mesons be written in the form of eq .",

    "we consider here the effects of the fermi motion of the quarks within the diffractively produced vector meson . as originally suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do this by keeping the quarks momenta in the propagator of the virtual photon , as the numerical coefficient which accompanies the leading term is large ( @xmath174 ) . we will show that account of fermi motion of the quarks within the vector meson leads to a significant suppression of the cross section at moderately large @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the formulae for diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons accounting for this fermi motion contain an additional factor , @xmath94 , which can be straightforwardly obtained from eq .",

    "inclusion of these radiative corrections effectively corresponds to a renormalization of the nonrelativistic wave function by the factor @xmath206 .",

    "another important difference stemming from the use of nonrelativistic oscillator wave functions , which do not take into account the @xmath1 evolution of the minimal fock space wave functions ( which is a strict consequence of qcd @xcite ) , is the qualitative difference between the behavior of radial and orbital ( e.g. @xmath30-state ) excitations .",
    "the production of the latter is strongly suppressed at large @xmath1 in the approximation considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , while we find essentially the same rate for both classes of excited states .",

    "a measurement of these reactions may help to better understand the dynamics of the diffractive production of vector mesons as well as the light - cone minimal fock state wave functions of these excited states .",
    "it may provide the first _ three dimensional _ images of these states , and it would also allow to look for the second missing excited @xmath22 state , which is likely to have a mass of about 1900 mev to follow the pattern of the @xmath5 , @xmath387 and @xmath4 families .",
    "the relative yield of excited states produced by virtual photons is expected to be higher than that for real photons since the vector dominance model ( vdm ) @xcite together with eq .",

    "another possible interpretation ( which maybe complementary to the one above ) is a large contribution of nondiagonal transitions @xmath398 in the scattering off nuclei .",

    "consider , for example , the diffractive production of a @xmath403 meson in @xmath404 scattering . to calculate this cross section ,",
    "it is sufficient to substitute in eq .",

    "it is often discussed that the production of hadrons in @xmath57annihilation at intermediate masses ( @xmath407 gev ) can be described as the production and decay of several vector meson resonances . within this approximation",
    ", we can generalize eq .",
    "( [ eq5a ] ) to the case of diffractive electroproduction of hadron states in the continuum . to deduce the relevant formulae",
    ", we assume that for excited vector meson resonances @xmath58 is close to its asymptoic value , @xmath408 = 3 .",
    "this assumption really follows from the application of the dispersion sum rule approach . in the limits @xmath409 , @xmath410 and @xmath411",
    ", we obtain : @xmath412    in is worth emphasizing that in the case of diffraction to high enough masses , where the intermediate @xmath156 state can be approximated by a free @xmath413 pair , the contribution of large transverse distances is not suppressed and the cross section gets both soft and hard contributions .",
    "consequently , in the intermediate @xmath414 range , where resonances are still present but the continuum is already essential , one should expect a faster increase with energy ( at fixed @xmath1 ) of the resonance contribution .    to summarize , the investigation of exclusive diffractive processes appears to be the most effective method to measure the minimal fock state @xmath49 component of the wave functions of vector mesons as well as the light - cone wave functions of any small mass hadron system having angular momentum one .",
    "it seems that the cross sections of these processes are rather sensitive to the three dimensional distribution of color within the wave functions of vector mesons .",
    "this observation could be very helpful in expanding methods of lattice qcd into the domain of high energy processes .",
    "in the above , we have explained that the increase of the cross section with energy ( @xmath415 ) at fixed @xmath1 originates from the energy dependence of the @xmath416 cross section , see eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and fig . 3 . but , in the region dominated by hard physics ,",
    "the value of this cross section is restricted by the unitarity of the @xmath417-matrix , and even more stringent restrictions follow from the condition that the leading twist term should be significantly larger than the next to leading twist term . in detail , let us consider the scattering of a small object , a @xmath49 pair , from a large object , a nucleon . if only hard physics were relevant for the increase of the parton distributions at small @xmath2 , the radius of the @xmath11-nucleon interaction should be practically independent on energy , because , in this case , gribov diffusion in the impact parameter space would be determined by the scale characteristic for hard processes .",
    "we shall explore this observation to establish the region of applicability of the leading @xmath418 and @xmath419 approximations .",
    "thus , the geometrical restriction is that , in the hard regime , the inelastic cross section can not exceed the geometrical size of the target nucleon .",
    "an equivalent , but practically more convenient , formulation of this important property of hard processes is that the slope of the differential cross section should not increase with energy .",
    "it is just this property of hard processes which gives the possibility to deduce an unitarity limit for their cross sections and/or on the region dominated by hard physics .",
    "we will start our considerations with the derivation of the boundary for the region where the decomposition over powers of @xmath420 can be a sensible approximation .",
    "a formal method to deduce this restriction is to consider scattering of heavy quarkonium @xmath421 states from a hadron target , and to vary the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "since the result of such a derivation is evident , in this paper we use an equivalent but shorter way to deduce this inequality @xcite : we establish the limit by applying the optical theorem to calculate the elastic cross section for scattering of a small - transverse - size @xmath49 pair off a nucleon : @xmath422 where @xmath423 for simplicity , we parametrize the dependence of the differential cross section on the momentum transfer @xmath54 , at small @xmath54 ( which dominate the cross section ) , in the form of an exponential . as the observed @xmath54 dependence of hard diffractive processes is close to that given by the square of the nucleon s electromagnetic form factor , i.e. , @xmath424 , to visualize the deduced limit , it is convenient to express the experimental value of the slope of the @xmath54 dependence of the cross section through the average quadratic radius of a nucleon : @xmath425 where @xmath426 fm .",
    "it follows from qcd ( cf .",
    "discussion in sect .",
    "iii.a ) that this value should be universal for all hard processes .",
    "existing data on hard diffractive production of vector mesons are in line with this qcd prediction , and we can use it to calculate the elastic cross section : @xmath427 in the derivation of the boundary for the region where the leading @xmath418 and @xmath419 approximations are applicable , one should actually add to eq .",
    "( [ 61ee ] ) the contribution from proton dissociation , i.e. , one should multiply @xmath428 by @xmath429 where @xmath430% .",
    "the necessary condition for the applicability of the decomposition of the deep inelastic cross section over powers of @xmath1 is that the leading twist contribution should exceed nonleading twist terms . in our case , this implies that @xmath431 , where @xmath432 accounts for the dissociation of the proton .",
    "so , the boundary for the applicability of the decomposition over powers of @xmath433 is @xmath434 . using eq .",

    "it can only be translated into an actual kinematical boundary if one considers purely hard physics , where @xmath435 is restricted by the nucleon size . in general",
    ", however , the slope @xmath435 and its energy dependence have to be evaluated separately , which has not been done so far .",
    "such analysis would lead to the froissart limit , with @xmath435 and the cross section slowly increasing with energy .",
    "note also that eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) has been deduced in the approximation where only the leading power of @xmath117 has been taken into account .",
    "a more stringent limit follows from the requirement that the single particle density in the center of rapidity should be positive .",
    "really , it follows from the application of abramovski@xmath439 , gribov and kancheli ( agk ) combinatorics @xcite that this multiplicity is proportional to @xmath440 .",
    "thus , in the approximation when only one hard rescattering is accounted for , we have @xmath441 .    therefore , the kinematical boundary for the region of applicability of the leading logarithm approximation is significantly more stringent than that given by the unitarity condition : @xmath442 eq .",

    "actually , it is likely that the slow down starts earlier , in particular due to dispersion in @xmath50 .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of this effect is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the advantage of the approach used in this paper , as compared to previous attempts ( for a review and references see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , is that we actually deduce the qcd formulae for the cross section for scattering of a @xmath49 pair off a hadron target . for this cross section ,",
    "the geometrical limit ( including numerical coefficients ) unambiguously follows from the unitarity of the @xmath417-matrix , that is from the geometry of the collision ( under the assumptions made in refs .",
    "@xcite on the dominance of hard physics near the unitarity limit ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain a more stringent inequality which contains no free parameters .",
    "recently , a quantitative estimate of the saturation limit was obtained  @xcite by considering the glr model  @xcite of nonlinear effects in the parton evolution and requiring that the nonlinear term should be smaller than the linear term .",
    "the constraint obtained in that paper is numerically much less restrictive than our result : the parameter characterizing the scale of corrections found in ref .",
    "@xcite differs from ours by a numerical factor @xmath447 .",
    "the qualitative reason for this difference is that the glr model neglects elastic rescatterings of the @xmath11 pair , and it does not take into account the requirement of positiveness of the single particle density . the consideration of a specific cut of the double scattering diagram , which corresponds to the shadowing of the single hadron multiplicity , and the requirement that the single multiplicity should be positive leads , within this model , to the restriction that @xmath448 can not exceed @xmath449 .",
    "the numerical coefficient follows then from the application of abramovski@xmath439 , gribov and kancheli ( agk ) combinatorics @xcite .",
    "this observation indicates that , in the glr model @xcite , hard double scattering may decrease the parton density by not more than @xmath450 ( and by no more than the observed diffraction fraction of the cross section which is @xmath451 at hera ) . as usual , if the corrections become large enough , one can not restrict the consideration to one particular contribution .",
    "we want to point out that the deduced constraint implies only a restriction on the limiting behavior of the cross sections for hard processes , but it gives no clues whether this boundary can be achieved . in reality , the increase of the cross sections of hard processes should slow down already at larger @xmath2 than those given by the constraint which we deduced here .",
    "this is because in the derivation of the boundary we ignore , amongst others , the for feynman diagrams characteristic diffusion in the parton ladder to large distances , effects related to the dispersion of @xmath50 as well as other hard diffractive processes which also fastly increase at @xmath452 .",
    "the dynamical mechanism responsible for the slowing down of the increase of the parton distributions , so that they satisfy , for instance , eq .",

    "@xcite does not lead to large effects at hera energies , especially if one assumes a homogeneous transverse density of gluons  @xcite .",
    "the application of similar consideration to the scattering off nuclei leads to a more severe restriction on the gluon distribution in nuclei : @xmath453 here , @xmath454 is the radius of the nucleus and @xmath455 stems from the dissociation of the nucleus .",

    "( [ 61ff ] ) , and if @xmath470 , we substitute it by @xmath471 . since in the discussed kinematics , the unitarity corrections to @xmath472 are still small , the ratio of cross sections calculated with and without this unitarity correction characterizes the effective gluon shadowing for @xmath257 and vector meson production . in the case of @xmath5-meson production , we chose the same wave function as in sect .",
    "iii with @xmath473 mev / c .",
    "we also checked that varying @xmath474 in the range @xmath475 mev / c practically does not change our results .",
    "the relevant ratios , @xmath476 and @xmath477 are presented in fig .",
    "15 for @xmath478 and @xmath479 and for @xmath4802 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 40 gev@xmath7 . for the sake of an easier comparison of the shadowing effects , in the case of @xmath5-meson production , we present plots for @xmath481 .",
    "clearly this estimate is an upper bound for these ratios since it neglects absorbtive effects for the case when the interaction is not black .",
    "to estimate nuclear shadowing within a dynamical model , we also consider the @xmath50-space eikonal approximation for the calculation of the same quantities .",
    "we first calculate the total cross section for the @xmath482 interaction by means of the optical theorem , @xmath483 and then evaluate the cross section of the @xmath484 interaction for a given impact parameter within the @xmath50-space eikonal approximation using the familiar glauber - gribov formula @xcite : @xmath485 \\over \\int\\!d^2b~dz~|\\psi_{\\gamma^*_l}(b , z)|^2~\\sigma_{tot}(b ) } \\ , \\label{rhoa } \\\\ r_v(a , x , q^2 ) & = & { 1 \\over a^2 } \\left| { \\int\\!d^2b~dz~\\psi_{\\gamma^*_l}(b , z)~\\psi_{\\rho}(b , z)~ \\int\\!d^2b\\left(2 - 2e^{-(1-i\\beta){\\sigma_{tot}(b ) t(b ) \\over 2}}\\right ) \\over \\int\\!d^2b~dz~\\psi_{\\gamma^*_l}(b , z)~\\psi_{\\rho}(b , z)~\\sigma_{tot}(b ) ( 1-i\\beta)}\\right|^2 \\ , \\label{rhob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath486 is the optical thickness of the nucleus and @xmath487 is the nuclear density normalized so that @xmath488 .",
    "we use eqs .",
    "( [ rhoa ] ) and ( [ rhob ] ) to estimate the nuclear shadowing for @xmath257 and for @xmath5-meson production employing a realistic nuclear density distribution , @xmath489)$ ] , where @xmath490 fm and @xmath491 fm .",
    "corresponding results are presented in fig . 16 .",
    "one can see from figs .",
    "15 and 16 that significant gluon shadowing is expected at small @xmath2 , and that shadowing is larger in the @xmath5-meson channel , i.e. , @xmath492 .",
    "this is again due to the larger @xmath50 for @xmath5-meson production ",
    "see the discussion in sect .",
    "also , in line with expectations of the color transparency logic , at fixed large @xmath1 , shadowing increases with decreasing @xmath2  i.e. , @xmath493 for @xmath452 and color transparency _ disappears _ for small enough @xmath2  while , for fixed small @xmath2 , shadowing decreases with increasing @xmath1  i.e. , @xmath494 at large @xmath1 and color transparency _ appears _ for large enough @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , from figs . 15 and 16",
    ", we observe that the nuclear shadowing which we deduce from the unitarity limit and from the eikonal model is significantly smaller than the black disk limit .",
    "this is partly due to the diffuse edge of the nucleus , and a practical conclusion from this observation is that nuclear shadowing of the parton distributions should be considerably larger for central @xmath331 collisions where the effects of the nuclear surface should be insignificant .",
    "note , however , that even those estimates are still likely to underestimate the relevant shadowing since they do not explicitly include gluon shadowing in the leading twist , i.e. logarithmically decreasing at large @xmath1 .",
    "still , our estimate corresponds to significantly larger gluon shadowing than that obtained in a number of previous papers , where it was assumed that for @xmath495 few gev@xmath7 the leading twist shadowing in the gluon channel and for @xmath496 are approximately the same @xcite .",
    "note that qualitative arguments in favor of larger shadowing in the gluon channel were presented in ref .",
    "the quantities @xmath497 and @xmath498 of eqs .",
    "( [ rhoa ] ) and ( [ rhob ] ) were also evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite using the two - gluon - exchange model , in which the elementary cross section of the interactions with the constituent quarks does not depend on energy . as a result , in this model",
    ", attenuation does not depend on @xmath2 for small @xmath2 .    in principle , shadowing effects in the kinematics beyond the region of applicability of the evolution equation may change the dependence of the differential cross section on @xmath54 , the momentum transferred to the nucleus @xcite . in that realm",
    ", the eikonal approximation leads to the famous pattern with minima and maxima .",
    "another well known feature of the eikonal approximation , which is specific for potentials fastly increasing with energy , is the shrinking of the diffractive peak with energy . since , within this model , both soft and hard physics are important , the radius of a nucleon may increase with energy , and , for this regime , the unitarity restriction for processes dominated by hard physics , which we discussed above , could be exceeded and the cross section may increase with @xmath2 , but more slowly as a power of @xmath499 . for a nuclear target , such effects are expected to be insignificant , although for a nucleon target they may be large .    to summarize , the analysis presented in this section demonstrates that large shadowing effects should be present at small @xmath2 in the gluon channel .",
    "this has a number of implications for high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions , where the predictions for hadron production strongly depend on gluon shadowing , as was pointed out , for example , in ref .",
