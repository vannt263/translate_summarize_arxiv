    "earthquakes are one of the most devastating natural calamities that can shatter human civilization in large extent .",
    "naturally , scientists are investigating this phenomena in great detail .",
    "the most robust empirically established facts in the phenomenology of earthquakes are the gutenberg - richter law  @xcite and the omori law  @xcite .",
    "while the gutenberg - richter law expresses the relationship between frequency and magnitude of tremors in a region , the omori law describes the temporal rate of decay of aftershocks .",
    "different models have been proposed to study the phenomena of earthquakes .",
    "one well - known example is the burridge - knopoff model that demonstrates the statistical properties of earthquakes using friction on a fault surface as a stickslip process  @xcite .",
    "it is considered that large faults in the earth s crust are formed due to the action of plate tectonic forces .",
    "plate tectonic theory , which is based on alfred wegener s continental drift theory  @xcite , is considered to be the fundamental theoretical framework in the field of earth science and plays the pivotal role to explain tremors .",
    "this theory states that earth s outer shell , the lithosphere is divided into several rigid pieces , called plates .",
    "there are mainly eight major plates : african , antarctic , eurasian , north american , south american , pacific , and indo - australian .",
    "when a pair of plates move with respect to each other they do not deform internally rather they deform along their edges and create earthquakes and volcanoes along the edges of the plates .",
    "recently a complex network approach has been applied to observe the universal features of the earthquake phenomena from seismic catalogs .",
    "based on the work of bak _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite , baiesi and paczuski , using a correlation metric between a pair of events , have constructed a network in which tremors are the nodes and a pair of nodes are linked if the correlation between them is higher than a certain threshold  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the earthquake network exhibits a scale - free nature with highly heterogeneous degree distribution characterized by a power law . in another study , abe and sazuki",
    "have constructed the network using a grid , covering the entire earthquake events over a region  @xcite . a cell of the grid is considered to be a node",
    "if at least one epicenter occurs within the cell , and the cell size is a tunable parameter for the model .",
    "a pair of nodes is connected by a link if two successive events occur on those two nodes . using this network model",
    ", they found various robust features of the earthquake network .",
    "they have shown that earthquake networks exhibit a power - law degree distribution  @xcite small - world phenomena  @xcite , assortativity  @xcite and scaling in local clustering  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , different structural properties of weighted earthquake network have also been studied extensively in  @xcite .    although universal features of earthquake networks of different regions have been studied extensively  @xcite , but no study has thus for been devoted to capturing the similarity and dissimilarity between earthquake networks of different regions .",
    "a study of hierarchical clustering  @xcite of earthquake networks will be very useful in this regard .",
    "hierarchical clustering is usually represented by a dendrogram that pictorially shows the similar entities are clustered together in groups .",
    "quantitatively , the similarity between networks could be measured based on different properties , viz . ,",
    "euclidean distance , structural properties and dynamical behavior .",
    "primarily , earthquake networks are directed sequence of consecutive events , so analyzing the directed structure of the earthquake network can give more information than the underlying structure of the earthquake network  @xcite .",
    "not only the directed structure of earthquake network , studying the directed sequence of earthquake events can also give us important insight , such as , prediction of consecutive earthquakes .",
    "in this paper , we divide our study of earthquake data into two parts . in the first part",
    ", we follow the method of abe and suzuki to construct the earthquake network as it is connected to a universal law  @xcite . the similarity between each pair of spectral probability functions of eleven earthquake networks",
    "is measured using a probabilistic measure viz . , jensen - shanon divergence . using the similarity distances ,",
    "the hierarchical clustering between earthquake networks is shown as a dendrogram .",
    "the hierarchical clustering of earthquake networks reveals the similar or dissimilar nature of different earthquake regions based on their position on different tectonic plates .",
    "we also measure the frequency of earthquake events on a node and identify the earthquake prone locations for different regions .",
    "in the second part , we find the pair of regions where consecutive earthquake events have occurred with relatively higher frequency .",
    "for this , we calculate the conditional probability between two successive events .",
    "we also compare the conditional probability of two consecutive earthquakes with their stationary conditional probability to predict the occurrence of an earthquake event at a node consecutively after one occurs at a certain node .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we study the highly earthquake prone locations of different regions as it has been reported earlier  @xcite that the degree distributions of unweighted as well as the strength distribution of weighted earthquake networks are highly heterogeneous with power - law distributions .",
    "it indicates that few nodes of the network are having very high degree or strength known as hub and large number of nodes are having small degree or strength .",
    "we have found the exact location of the node ( the mid point of a square cell where maximum number of earthquakes occurred ) having maximum strength @xmath0 in different earthquake regions .",
    "the exact latitude - longitude coordinates of the nodes having maximum strength are ( 34.36 , -116.45),(37.56 , -118.43 ) , ( 34.97 , 139.16 ) ( 47.39 , -70.08 ) , ( 38.40 , 46.73 ) , ( 38.39 , 21.89 ) , ( 36.56 , -89.64 ) , ( 55.83 , -3.09 ) , ( -30.82 , 117.24 ) , ( 46.32 , 7.36 ) , ( -39.03 , 175.15 ) with @xmath0 = 7815 , 3935 , 2026 , 3412 , 173 , 2774 , 1343 , 655 , 712 , 184 , 13417 for sc , nc , jap , can , iran , gr , nm , bi , aus , sz and nz , respectively .",
    "top ten earthquake prone locations of each earthquake region are shown in the table [ table3 ] .",
    "now , we analyze the consecutive occurrence of earthquake events .",
    "first , we quantify the pair of nodes having the link with maximum weight @xmath1 for different earthquake regions . here",
    ", the maximum weight indicates highest number of consecutive earthquake events between the pair of nodes in that earthquake region .",
    "the exact latitude - longitude coordinates for the top ten pairs of nodes with maximum weight @xmath2 are shown in the third column of the table [ table4]-[table5 ] .",
    "now , using the same column ( @xmath2 ) of the above mention tables , we may roughly cluster the earthquake regions into four clusters consisting of ( i ) sc , nz , nc ( ii ) iran , sz ( iii ) can , nm , jap ( iv ) gr , bi , aus . in this clustering ,",
    "most of the regions that are geographically proximal or close in the dendrogram ( fig .",
    "3 ) appear in the same cluster .",
