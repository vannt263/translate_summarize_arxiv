    "evolved luminous stars with an initial mass more than 20 @xmath2 are believed to enter an instability phase , historically known as luminous blue variable ( lbv ) .",
    "this phase is characterized by intense mass - loss rates ( @xmath4 ) , associated to visual / near - ir spectroscopic and photometric variabilities @xcite , before the star evolves as wolf - rayet ( wr ) , once it has reduced its mass @xcite . however , the occurrence of this phase during the massive stars evolution and the mass - loss mechanism are still not well understood , mostly because of the rarity of lbvs in our galaxy . for the moment ,",
    "the objects that satisfy the variability criteria coupled with high mass - loss rates are only 12 in the milky way , but recently the number of candidate lbvs ( clbvs ) has been increased to 55 @xcite , based on the discovery of ring nebulae surrounding these luminous stars .",
    "in fact , as a result of the mass - loss , such evolved massive stars can be surrounded by circumstellar nebulae , rich of processed material @xcite .",
    "lbv nebulae ( lbvne ) have been observed in about 20 objects among lbvs and clbvs in our galaxy and they have shown to be dusty , hence emitting in a wide spectral domain .",
    "such nebulae are indeed the fingerprints of the mass - loss phenomenon , therefore multiwavelength observations provide unique insights in the lbv mass - loss history .    the importance of studying lbvne is increased by the possibility that they can skip the wr stage and experience the explosive supernova ( sn ) event ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if this is true , the lbv mass - loss phenomenon is of great interest also for the study of type iin sne , whose evolution is influenced by the circumstellar material originated through mass - loss of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss archaeology appears to be , therefore , fundamental for different aspects of the massive stars evolution .    in this work",
    "we propose a new study of the ejecta around g79.29 + 0.46 , a galactic candidate lbv located in the cygnus - x ( @xmath5 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one of the richest star forming regions in our galaxy .",
    "thanks to its location and also to its beautiful aspect and intriguing nature , this star and its associated nebula have been widely observed in spectral domains ranging from the optical to the radio .",
    "these observations have allowed to investigate different components of the ejecta associated to g79.29 + 0.46 , which showed to have lost mass with different events @xcite .",
    "diverse works focused on this source can be mentioned ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a comprehensive study of the star and its associated nebula has never been performed as yet . moreover , the physical parameters determined in these works are often based on different assumptions , making difficult their comparison and interpretation . for instance , @xcite interpreted the ring - like shell around the star as interstellar material swept - up by the stellar wind and estimated for this shell a mass of about 14 - 15 @xmath6 .",
    "later , the nebula has been recognized as ejecta associated to the star @xcite , but a reappraisal of its properties is still missing .",
    "the nebular mass inferred by @xcite and @xcite suggests that the nebula associated to g79.29 + 0.46 is amongst the most massive known ( cf .",
    "table 9 in * ? ? ?",
    "if correct , the mass would rival that of the homunculus around @xmath7 carina ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the central star of g79.29 + 0.46 is likely over an order of magnitude fainter ( about @xmath8 , while @xmath7 car is @xmath9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and consequently far less massive .",
    "therefore , the nebular mass would represent a higher proportion of its initial mass .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new analysis of the multiple components of the nebula around g79.29 + 0.46 , by means of recent observations which we performed in the radio domain , new far - ir images provided by the _",
    "space observatory and other archival far- and mid - ir spectroscopic and photometric datasets collected in the last 20 years by different telescopes .",
    "the main assumption in this work is that the photometric and spectroscopic properties of this star has not changed significantly in the considered time - lapse , hypothesis reinforced by the fact that g79.29 + 0.46 is still a candidate lbv , since no significant visual or near - ir variability has been observed so far @xcite .",
    "this work started with our observations of g79.29 + 0.46 performed at the expanded very large array ( evla ) .",
    "preliminary results of these observations were presented in @xcite ( paper 1 hereafter ) , and the highest resolution radio image was compared with the _ spitzer _ infrared images , revealing us that the multiple shells around the star have signature of different populations of dust and that the radio emission is ionization bounded . in this paper",
    "we complement the preliminary work in paper 1 with new radio observations performed at the green bank telescope ( gbt ) to overcome the typical problem of interferometers , which is the ",
    "zero baseline missing \" , resulting in the impossibility to determine the total flux of extended sources .",
    "therefore we propose a new analysis of the radio emission aimed at determining important physical parameters related to the ionized gas and to the central star .",
    "we also perform an analysis of the ir datasets retrieved from the data archives , in order to determine ir lines and physical properties related to the dust component .",
    "the paper is organized as in the following : in section [ par : obs ] we describe our observations and the archival datasets considered in this study",
    ". then we present our analysis of the radio datasets ( section [ par : maps ] ) , focused on the ionized gas distribution and emission , while in section [ par : infrared ] we study the dust emission and properties , probed by the ir images .",
    "section [ sec : irspectra ] concerns the spectroscopic mid- and far - ir analysis of the nebula and in section [ sec : sed ] we present a simple model obtained with the photo - ionization code cloudy .",
    "we conclude with a brief description of the star mass - loss history in section [ sec : discus ] ."
