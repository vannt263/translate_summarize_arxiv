    "perhaps the strongest constraint on the potential significance of star formation in qsos comes from the far - infrared part of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "indeed , this far - infrared emission has been interpreted as due to star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "adopting standard mid - infrared low resolution diagnostics @xcite , the weak pah features on top of a strong continuum agree with the notion that the cloverleaf is energetically dominated by its agn .",
    "the detection of pah features with several mjy peak flux density in a z@xmath12.6 galaxy , however , implies intense star formation , which we discuss in conjunction with other properties of the cloverleaf .    by fitting a lorentzian superposed on a local polynomial continuum , we measure a flux of 1.52@xmath17w@xmath18 for the 6.2@xmath0 m feature , with a s / n of 6 .",

    ". we leave further discussion of the properties of silicates to a future paper . for the 7.7@xmath0 m feature of the cloverleaf",
    ", we adopt a flux of 6.1@xmath17w@xmath18 .",
    "this flux was determined by scaling a pah template ( iso spectrum of m82 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the measured cloverleaf 6.2@xmath0 m feature flux , and then fitting three lorentzians to represent the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 features plus a local polynomial continuum to this template .",
    "similar lorentzian fits were also used for local comparison objects discussed below . @xcite",
    "have quantified the scatter of the 6.2 to 7.7@xmath0 m flux ratio in starbursts , with 0.07 in the log this scatter indicates the modest uncertainty induced by tying the longer wavelength features to the 6.2@xmath0 m one .",
    "the result of subtracting the scaled m82 template from the cloverleaf spectrum is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : irs ] , and shows a combination of continuum and silicate emission very similar to local qsos . directly measuring the 7.7@xmath0 m flux by fitting a single lorentzian plus local continuum to the cloverleaf spectrum gives a @xmath140% lower feature flux , which would be a systematic underestimate because of the complexity of the underlying continuum / silicates discussed above .",

    "@xcite decomposed the sed into two modified blackbodies of temperature 50 and 115k , the rest frame far - infrared ( 40 - 120@xmath0 m ) luminosity of @xmath2l@xmath3 is dominated by the colder component and could largely originate in star formation .",
    "comparison of pah and far - infrared emission can shed new light on this question .",
    "the bolometric ( rather than rest - frame far - infrared ) luminosity of the cloverleaf will still be dominated by the agn .",
    "we estimate l@xmath20 extrapolating from the observed rest frame 6@xmath0 m continuum which for a mid - infrared spectrum with weak pah but strong continuum will be agn dominated @xcite . using l@xmath21 based on an @xcite radio - quiet qso",

    "a similar estimate @xmath23l@xmath3 is obtained from the rest frame optical ( observed near - infrared ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) continuum , tracing the agn ionizing continuum , and the same global sed .",
    "@xcite have measured pah emission in local qsos and compared the pah to far - infrared emission ratio to that for starbursting ulirgs , i.e. those among a larger ulirg sample not showing evidence for dominant agn and not having absorption dominated mid - infrared spectra .",
    "[ fig : pahtofir ] places the cloverleaf on their relation between 7.7@xmath0 m pah luminosity and far - infrared luminosity .",
    "@xmath24 is 0.014 for the cloverleaf , very close to the mean value for the 12 starburst - dominated ulirgs of @xmath25 .",
    "the scatter of this relation is 0.2 in the log for these 12 comparison ulirgs , indicating the minimum uncertainty of extrapolating from the pah to far - infrared emission .",
    "the cloverleaf thus extends the relation between pah and far - infrared luminosity for the local qsos and ulirgs to @xmath15 times larger luminosities .",
    "its pah emission is consistent with an extremely luminous starburst of ulirg - like physical conditions powering essentially all of the rest frame far - infrared emission .    @xcite present the irs spectrum of the lensed fir - bright type 2 agn iras f10214 + 4724 at similar redshift .",
    "they report a marginal feature at 6.2@xmath0 m rest wavelength which they do not interpret as pah given the lack of a 7.7@xmath0 m maximum . given the strength of silicate emission in this target",
    ", pah emission may be present in the blue wing of the silicate feature without producing a maximum , and such a component may be suggested by comparing their fig .  1 with the later onset of silicate emission in the spectra of local qsos .",
    "the tentative 6.2@xmath0 m peak in iras f10214 + 4724 has similar peak height as the cloverleaf pah feature , in line with our interpretation and the similar rest frame fir fluxes of the two objects .    with @xmath15 - 10% of its total luminosity originating in the rest frame far - infrared and by star formation ,",
    "the cloverleaf is within the range of local qsos , and not a pronounced infrared excess object . specifically , its ratio of fir to total luminosity and the ratio of rest frame far - infrared ( 60@xmath0 m ) to mid - infrared ( 6@xmath0 m ) continuum are about twice those of the @xcite radio - quiet qso sed .",
    "adopting the conclusion of @xcite that star formation already dominates the fir emission of local pg qsos and considering the modest fir ` excess ' of the cloverleaf compared to the @xcite sed then suggests only a small agn contribution to its fir luminosity .",
    "other z@xmath12 qsos may have lower ratios of fir and total luminosity , and conversely larger agn contributions to their more modest fir emission , though .",
    "after correcting for lensing , the cloverleaf submm flux is a factor @xmath12 above the typical bright z@xmath12 qsos of @xcite whose rest frame b magnitudes in addition are typically brighter than the delensed cloverleaf .",
    "submillimeter galaxies host starbursts of similar luminosity as the cloverleaf , at similar redshift .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have obtained irs mid - infrared spectra of 13 smgs with median redshift 2.8 , finding mostly starburst dominated systems",
    ". a comparison can be made between pah peak flux density and flux density at rest wavelength 222@xmath0 m which is obtained with minimal extrapolation from observed scuba 850@xmath0 m fluxes . combining the 7.7@xmath0 m feature peak of 5.1mjy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irs ] ) with a @xmath26 extrapolation of the scuba flux of @xcite places the cloverleaf at @xmath27 , near the center of the distribution of this quantity for the smgs of ( * ? ? ? * their fig.4 ) . like the smgs",
    ", the cloverleaf appears to host a scaled up ulirg - like starburst , but with superposition of a much more powerful agn , also in comparison to the gas mass .",
    "tracers of high density gas , in particular hcn but also hco@xmath28 have been detected in a few high redshift qsos including the cloverleaf @xcite .",
    "their ratio to far - infrared emission is similar to the one for galactic dense star forming regions , and has been used to argue for dense , high pressure star forming regions dominating the far - infrared luminosity of these qsos as well as of local ulirgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "intense hcn emission is observed also from x - ray dominated regions close to agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is ongoing debate as to the possible contributions of chemistry and excitation in x - ray dominated regions , and other effects like radiative pumping , to the emission of dense molecular gas tracers in ulirgs and qsos @xcite . unlike hcn , pah emission is severely reduced in x - ray dominated regions close to agn @xcite and provides an independent check of the effects of the agn on the molecular gas versus the role of the host and its star formation . in a scenario where xdrs dominate the strong hcn emission and the hosts pah emission , reproducing the consistent ratios of these quantities to rest - frame far - infrared over a wide range of far - infrared luminosities would thus require a considerable amount of finetuning .",
    "in contrast , these consistent ratios are a natural implication if all these components are dominated by ulirg - like dense star formation .",
    "our detection of pah emission is strong support to a scenario in which the cloverleaf qso coexists with intense star formation . applying the @xcite conversion from infrared luminosity to star formation rate to l@xmath29l@xmath3",
    "suggests a star formation rate close to 1000 m@xmath3yr@xmath6 , which can be maintained for a gas exhaustion timescale of only @xmath30yr , for the molecular gas mass inferred by @xcite . at this time resolution",
    ", the period of qso activity coincides with what likely is the most significant star forming event in the history of the cloverleaf host .",
