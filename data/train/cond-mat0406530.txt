    "solitons are solutions of wave equation where localization is obtained due to a nonlinear attractive interaction .",
    "solitons have been noted in optics @xcite , high - energy physics and water waves @xcite , and more recently in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "the bright solitons of attractive bec represent local maxima @xcite , whereas dark solitons of repulsive bec represent local minima @xcite .",
    "a classic text - book example of soliton appears in the following one - dimensional nonlinear free schrdinger equation in dimensionless units @xcite @xmath0 the solitons of this equation are localized solution due to the attractive nonlinear interaction @xmath1 with wave function at time @xmath2 and position @xmath3 : @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the energy @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation with a nonlinear interaction @xmath6 does not sustain a localized solitonic solution in two ( 2d ) or three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "however , a radially trapped and axially free version of this equation in 3d does sustain such a bright solitonic solution @xcite which has been observed experimentally in bec @xcite .    to generate a soliton without trap",
    "the repulsive kinetic pressure has to balance the attractive force . for a condensate of size @xmath7 ,",
    "kinetic energy is proportional to @xmath8 whereas attraction is proportional to @xmath9 in @xmath10 dimensions .",
    "the effective potential , which is a sum of these two terms , has a confining minimum only for @xmath11 leading to a stable bound state @xcite .",
    "thus no stabilization can be obtained in 2d or 3d and any attempt to create a soliton either leads to collapse or an expansion to infinity .",
    "a scheme of stabilization of a soliton in two dimensions has been suggested @xcite recently by a rapid periodic temporal modulation of scattering length @xmath12 of angular frequency @xmath13 via @xmath14 $ ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants and @xmath2 is time .",
    "such a modulation of the scattering length is possible by manipulating an external magnetic field near a feshbach resonance @xcite and has been employed in different studies of the bec @xcite . by such a modulation",
    "the atomic interaction can be easily switched between attractive and repulsive thus resulting in a rapid contraction and expansion of the condensate .",
    "if the constants of modulation are appropriately chosen this leads to a stabilization of the condensate in 2d with breathing oscillation @xcite .",
    "however , it has been  proved \" by analytic and numerical calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite that such a stabilization does not take place in 3d .    as the problem of stabilization of a soliton in a trapless condensate is of utmost interest in several areas , e.g. , optics @xcite , nonlinear physics @xcite and bose - einstein condensate , we revisit this problem and find that a temporal modification of the scattering length can also lead to a stabilization of the trapless soliton in 3d .",
    "we use both variational as well as numerical solutions of the mean - field time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation to establish our claim . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first suggestion of stabilization of a trapless soliton in 3d .",
    "we find numerically that an untrapped attractive condensate can maintain a reasonably constant spatial profile over a large interval of time through the temporal modulation of the s - wave scattering length .",
    "we also point out a possible reason for the failure to stabilize a bright soliton in 3d in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present approach is also extended to stabilize vortex solitons in 2d @xcite with angular momentum @xmath17 per atom in the axial ( azimuthal ) direction .",
    "the two dimensional geometry can be achieved in an axially symmetric configuration by applying a strong trap in the axial direction @xcite .",
    "this is also equivalent to applying a very weak trap in the radial direction . in both cases",
    "the radial dimension of the condensate is much larger than the axial dimension and a 2d treatment can be justified .",
    "vortex solitons are rotating solitons of an attractive condensate and it is suggestive that a similar scheme can also be used to stabilize a vortex soliton of a trapless condensate in 3d . after the experimental observation @xcite of a vortex in a rotating bec and theoretical prediction @xcite of a radially trapped bright vortex soliton ,",
    "the experimental stabilization of trapless vortex solitons seems viable .",
    "however , the stabilization of a vortex soliton in 3d calls for a full three - dimensional calculation and is beyond the scope of the present study . in the present study",
    "we stick to a two - dimensional circularly symmetric configuration .",
    "it is well - known that in a real 3d problem , the vortices are unstable against azimuthal perturbation which breaks the azimuthal symmetry and calls for a full 3d treatment .",
    "however , these degrees of freedom are expected to be partially suppressed in the limit of a very strong azimuthal trap or a very weak radial trap when the vortex dynamics becomes essentially two dimensional . in that limit a circularly symmetric 2d calculation for a bright vortex soliton should be sufficient . in this paper",
    "we find that such a 2d vortex is stable against radial perturbation .",
    "however , we have not established its stability under transverse perturbation .",
    "the stability under transverse perturbation can be tested by a calculation in cartesian coordinates and would be an investigation of future interest .    in sec .",

    "<S> using variational and numerical solutions of the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation we show that a bright soliton can be stabilized in a trapless three - dimensional attractive bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) by a rapid periodic temporal modulation of scattering length alone by using a feshbach resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme also stabilizes a rotating vortex soliton in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> apart from possible experimental application in bec , the present study suggests that the spatiotemporal solitons of nonlinear optics in three dimensions can also be stabilized in a layered kerr medium with sign - changing nonlinearity along the propagation direction . </S>"
