    "sagittarius ( sgr ) a * , the compact radio source at the galactic center , is powered by accretion of a supermassive black hole of @xmath0 @xcite in the prevailing stellar winds in the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of sgr a * is more than 9 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding eddington luminosity , suggesting a radiatively inefficient accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the radiative cooling processes therefore may be ignored while studying the dynamics of the accretion flow near the black hole , which simplifies the dynamical equations and the corresponding numerical algorithms significantly .",
    "several general relativistic magneto - hydrodynamical ( grmhd ) codes have been developed over the past few years to study the structure of non - radiative accretion flows near black holes quantitatively @xcite .",
    "given the extensive observations available for this supermassive black hole , it provides perhaps the best opportunity to study the physical processes in the strong gravity near black holes with grmhd simulations @xcite .",
    "the observed linear polarization and variability of the millimeter to near - infrared ( nir ) emissions suggest that they are produced by the synchrotron process near the black hole @xcite .",
    "the longer wavelength emissions are circularly polarized @xcite with weak linear polarization observed during frequent outbursts or flares @xcite , which in combination with the continuity of the centimeter to sub - millimeter spectrum suggests a synchrotron origin for the longer wavelength emissions as well @xcite .",
    "the analogy of sgr a * with radio loud agns also favors a synchrotron scenario for the radio emission .",
    "however , the longer wavelength flux densities are less variable than the millimeter and sub - millimeter flux densities , indicating emissions from relatively larger radii @xcite .",
    "indeed , the millimeter and higher frequency emissions have been explained reasonably well with an accretion torus within @xmath2 of the black hole , where @xmath3 is the schwarzschild radius @xcite ; and high spatial resolution vlbi observations do show that the intrinsic size of the millimeter emission region is within @xmath4 in radius @xcite .",
    "while the general relativistic ( gr ) effects are important for these shorter wavelength emissions originating near the black hole @xcite , the longer wavelength emissions are produced beyond @xmath5 so that the gr effects are insignificant and one may readily use the grmhd simulations to model the observed emission without using the sophisticated gr ray - tracing radiation transfer codes for the polarized synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "high resolution x - ray observations with the _ chandra _ space telescope shows that the quiescent x - ray excess from the direction of sgr a * is extended and has ion emission lines in the spectrum , suggesting that the emission is mostly produced at large radii near the capture radius of the accretion flow by a plasma of a few kev in temperature @xcite .",
    "x - ray flares are routinely observed from the direction of sgr a * ( belanger et al .",
    "their spectra can be fitted with a featureless power law @xcite , and they appear to be always accompanied by nir flares , which are produced near the black hole @xcite .",
    "the correlation between the nir and x - ray flares indicates a synchrotron self - comptonization ( ssc ) origin for the x - ray flares @xcite , though the x - ray flares may also be produced via the bremsstrahlung process enhanced by instabilities related to the accretion process @xcite .",
    "recent observations of flares seem to favor a synchrotron process @xcite .",
    "the quiescent state x - ray emission from the inner accretion flow therefore must be lower than the observed flux level .",
    "x - ray emission can be produced through both the ssc and bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "the observed high radio flux level and low upper limit of x - ray flux suggest that the radio emission can not be produced via thermal synchrotron emission in a bounded flow @xcite .",
    "it therefore has to be produced by unbounded outflows and/or by nonthermal populations of relativistic electrons . given the non - radiative nature of the grmhd simulations , strong outflows and winds appear to be inevitable , especially for highly spinning black holes @xcite . in this paper , we investigate whether emissions from these simulated accretion flows can count for observations of sgr a * , especially the low frequency radio emissions , self - consistently .",
    "we carried out 2-dimensional ( 2d ) grmhd simulations with the cosmos++ and harm codes @xcite assuming axis - symmetry of the accretion flow .",
    "the accretion disk therefore must be aligned with the equatorial planes of spinning black holes .",
    "the length scale is determined by the black hole mass . since no radiative cooling",
    "is included , the density is scaled linearly with the mass accretion rate , and the gas temperature and plasma @xmath1 , defined as the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic field pressure , are independent of the black hole mass and accretion rate .",
    "grmhd simulations give the gas density , pressure , and magnetic field .",
    "the gas temperature can be derived from the equation of state .",
    "the mass of the supermassive black hole in sgr a * is well - measured by observations of stellar orbits around the black hole @xcite .",
    "one therefore needs to adjust the accretion rate , black hole spin , and electron distribution to fit the observed spectrum of sgr a*. we consider both a one temperature and a two - temperature model of electrons in the thermal synchrotron emission scenario . for non - thermal synchrotron models ,",
    "the electron distribution is assumed to follow a steep power - law with a low energy cutoff . in   2 we discuss the methods that we used to model the emission spectra from the simulated accretion flows . a detailed discussion of our results and the implications are given in   3 .",
    "we run the cosmos++ code over a simulation domain of @xmath6 in radius .",
    "initially , there is an equilibrium torus with the pressure maximum at @xmath7 . under the influence of the strong gravity of the central black hole",
    ", the torus evolves and the magneto - rotational - instability sets in and induces the accretion process @xcite .",
    "specific attributes of the accretion disc were examined and the magnetic field , gas temperature , and particle density profiles are shown in figure [ fig1.ps ] . because the simulation was run up to the dynamical time near @xmath7 , the initial torus structure has not relaxed completely and , beside the cusped accretion torus in the inner region , which corresponds to the particle concentration within @xmath7 , there is another high density region at @xmath8 , which maps to the initial torus .",
    "if the simulation were allowed to run longer , this region of high density would be pulled closer to the black hole and merge with the inner accretion torus .",

    "sgr a * is a radio source powered by accretion into a black hole .",
    "modeling the emission from this radio source at the galactic center provides us with knowledge of the dynamics of the accretion flow near black holes and helps us further understand the plasma physics processes of the accretion torus .",

    "although we were able to apply a two temperature model to this simulation to correctly match the shape of the observed radio emission spectrum , we had the reoccurring problem of exceeding the upper - bound imposed by _",
    "chandra _ in the x - ray emission spectrum .",
    "we also note that the harm simulation has a much smaller initially torus , which effectively reduces the bremsstrahlung x - ray flux .",
    "although this itself may suggest that the angular momentum of the accretion flow must be low @xcite , one needs to explore the dependence of the bremsstrahlung x - ray emission on the size of the initial torus to quantify this constraint .",
    "the above challenge of modeling observations of sgr a * with grmhd simulations may be alleviated by several means .",
    "first , as we have shown in the paper , nonthermal synchrotron emission is more efficient than thermal synchrotron and in the nonthermal scenario the radio spectrum may be fitted with a lower density normalization than the thermal one , which reduces the bremsstrahlung x - ray flux . the doppler effect , which we did nt consider in the current study ,",
    "is expected to boost the radio emission as well . introducing a black hole spin",
    ", one can produce even lower values of plasma @xmath1 and higher doppler boosting , both of which will enhance the radio emission .",
    "lastly , the bremsstrahlung x - ray may be suppressed by reducing the mean density in the accretion disk through the tilt of the accretion disk with respect to the black hole spin @xcite .",
    "three dimensional simulations are then needed to quantify this effect @xcite .    in our modeling ,",
    "we havent studied the dependence of the model spectrum on the inclinational angle of the accretion disk , the gr effect , and the transfer of polarized emission .",
    "however , the radio spectrum is expected to have very weak dependence on these factors .",
    "nevertheless , they should be included in a more complete study .",

    "<S> sagittarius ( sgr ) a * is a compact radio source at the galactic center , powered by accretion of fully ionized plasmas into a supermassive black hole of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the radio emission can not be produced through the thermal synchrotron process by a gravitationally bounded flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> general relativistic magneto - hydrodynamical ( grmhd ) simulations of black hole accretion show that there are strong unbounded outflows along the accretion . with the flow structure around the black hole given by grmhd simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate whether thermal synchrotron emission from these outflows may account for the observed radio emission and discuss the implications of this study on these grmhd simulations and possible production of non - thermal particles by this source . </S>",
    "<S> we find that simulations producing relatively high values of plasma @xmath1 can not produce the radio flux level without exceeding the x - ray upper limit set by _ </S>",

    "<S> observations through the bremsstrahlung process . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted radio spectrum is also harder than the observed spectrum both for the one temperature thermal model and a simple nonthermal model with a single power - law electron distribution . </S>",
    "<S> since higher frequency emission is produced at smaller radii , the electron temperature needs to be lower than the gas temperature near the black hole to reproduce the observed radio spectrum </S>",
    "<S> . a more complete modeling of the radiation processes , including the general relativistic effects and transfer of polarized radiation , will give more quantitative constraints on physical processes in sgr a * with the current multi - wavelength , multi - epoch , and polarimetric observations of this source . </S>"
