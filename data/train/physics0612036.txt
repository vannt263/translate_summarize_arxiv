    "ion traps play a key role in fundamental physics experiments ( ref . 1 ) . in this paper ,",
    "i focus on statistical methods for uncertainty analysis and planning of proton trap neutron lifetime experiments ( refs . 1 - 5 ) and related experiments such as ref . 6 . when a neutron decays , it produces a proton , an electron and an antineutrino .",
    "an accurate determination of the mean lifetime of the neutron is critically important for testing the fundamental theories of physics ( ref .",
    "further , the mean lifetime of the neutron is an important parameter in the astrophysical theory of big bang nucleosynthesis ( ref .",
    "8) . in a proton trap neutron lifetime experiment performed at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) ,",
    "a beam of neutrons passes through a detection volume .",
    "based on measurements of the neutron flux and the proton production rate , one measures the mean lifetime of the neutron .",
    "each run of the experiment consists of trapping stage where protons are confined in a trap ( refs .",
    "2 - 5 ) , and a detection stage .",
    "the detector provides incomplete information because it goes dead after detecting the first proton .",
    "based on the number of runs where a proton is detected , one can estimate the proton trapping rate .    in earlier work [ ref .",
    "9 ] , this estimation problem was studied using a bayesian method .",
    "given a particular realization of the data ( the number of runs where at least one ion ( proton in this paper ) is trapped ) , a formula for the posterior mean of the ion trapping rate was presented based on a prior probability model for the trapping rate . in this work ,",
    "i estimate the trapping rate by the method of maximum likelihood and focus on the statistical properties of this estimate .",
    "i neglect physical sources of systematic error due to effects such as a time varying proton trapping rate or fluctuations in the actual trapping stage interval about the nominal value sought by the experimenter .    in section 2 ,",
    "i demonstrate that the bias ( expected value minus true value ) and variance of the maximum likelihood estimate of the trapping rate @xmath2 are infinite .",
    "this is so because a rare realization of the data yields an infinite estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "this technical problem can be dealt with in various ways .",
    "one could quantify uncertainty by constructing confidence intervals of finite width even though the variance of the estimate is infinite .",
    "another approach would be to introduce a stopping rule so that the experiment is continued until no protons are trapped in at least one run .",
    "i do not pursue either of these approaches here .",
    "instead , i restrict the sample space to include only realizations of data where one observes at least one run where no protons are trapped . for realizations of data in this subsample ,",
    "the maximum likelihood estimate has finite first and second moments . in section 3 ,",
    "i derive asymptotically valid formulas for the bias , variance , and mean - square - error of a maximum likelihood estimate of the proton trapping rate computed from this subsample . in general , one expects estimates that are nonlinear functions of the observed data , such as the maximum likelihood estimate of the trapping rate , to be biased [ ref .",
    "10 ] . in section 4 ,",
    "where , based on nominal values of trapping rate and dead time , i determine the trapping time that minimizes the root - mean - square prediction error of the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath2 in the subsample of interest .",
    "in a simulated proton trapping experiment there are many runs . during each run",
    ", i assume that the duration of the proton trapping stage @xmath0 is an adjustable constant that is known with negligible uncertainty . during the trapping stage ,",
    "i assume that protons are trapped at a constant rate @xmath3 .",
    "further , i restrict attention to the case where @xmath4 0 . after the trapping stage , protons are purged from the trap .",
    "a proton detector provides incomplete information because it goes dead after detecting the first of any purged protons .",
    "further , there is a fixed dead time @xmath1 between the end of the trapping stage in one run and the beginning of the next trapping stage in the next run .",
    "i assume that @xmath1 is known with negligible uncertainty .",
    "if the total time of the experiment is @xmath5 , the total number of runs is @xmath6 above , the function @xmath7 rounds the continuous variable @xmath8 down to the nearest integer .",
    "let @xmath9 be the observed number of runs where at least one proton is trapped .",
    "i model the number of protons trapped during any run as a realization of a poisson process with expected value @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the probability that no ion is trapped for a given run is @xmath11 the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath9 is the number of runs where at least one proton is trapped .",
    "thus , the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath2 is @xmath14    since @xmath9 is a binomial random variable , the probability that @xmath15 is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 hence , the expected value of the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath3 is @xmath18 similarly , the expected squared value of the estimate is @xmath19 for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and both the expected value ( first moment ) and expected squared value ( second moment ) of @xmath22 are infinite .",
    "the variance of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is not defined because @xmath24 and both terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "8 are infinite .    to ensure that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are finite ,",
    "i restrict the sample space to realizations of the data where @xmath27 . from a practical point of view",
    ", this means that realizations of data where @xmath28 would be ignored . for neutron lifetime experiments of current interest ,",
    "the probability that @xmath28 is negligible provided that @xmath0 is judiciously chosen .",
    "hence , this subsampling restriction does not significantly affect data collection procedures for neutron lifetime experiments of current interest . in this subsample ,",
    "the discrete probability density function for allowed realizations of @xmath29 is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 for this subsample , the first two moments of the maximum likelihood estimate are @xmath32 and @xmath33 since the first two moments ( eqns .",
    "10 and 11 ) of @xmath22 are finite , the variance of @xmath22 is defined and finite .",
    "next , i present analytical formulas to approximate the fractional bias , fractional standard deviation and fractional root - mean - square prediction error of the estimate computed for this subsample .",
    "in the subsample where @xmath34 , i derive asymptotically valid approximations for the fractional bias ( @xmath35 ) , fractional root - mean - square prediction error ( @xmath36 ) , and fraction standard deviation ( @xmath37 ) of @xmath22 where @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40    to facilitate analysis of @xmath22 in the subsample i write @xmath41 @xmath42 thus , @xmath43 where @xmath44 in the subsample , @xmath45 takes discrete values in the following interval @xmath46    the @xmath47 of the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath2 in the subsample is @xmath48 where @xmath45 is a random variable .",

    "@xmath35 was much less than @xmath36 ( see figure 1 and table 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath35 was more sensitive to @xmath0 than @xmath36 was ( figure 1 ) . for the cases summarized in table 1 ,",
    "the fractional systematic error and fractional rms prediction error are well approximated as @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "for each cases , both @xmath36 and @xmath78 ( eqn .",
    "29 ) took their minimum values at @xmath79 0.014 s. the resolution of the grid on which i computed rms prediction errors is 0.001 s in the neighborhood of the 0.014 s.    in a second simulation , i set @xmath80 400 s and @xmath74 100 hz . i vary @xmath0 so that the expected number of trapped protons per run , @xmath10 , varies from .001 to 4 . for these cases ,",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath78 closely track the actual values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( table 2 ) .",
    "for the smallest values of @xmath0 , the accuracies of the approximations are highest .",
    "i attribute the slight degradation of approximation accuracy at the largest values of @xmath10 to the fact that @xmath82 ( eq .",
    "31 ) is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath0 .    for convenience ,",
    "i express the fractional rms prediction error of @xmath83 as @xmath84 where @xmath5 is the total time of the experiment .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 is a function of @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in proton trap neutron lifetime experiments",
    ", @xmath2 depends on experimental details including the length of the trap ; trapping efficiency ; and the neutron flux ( refs . 2 - 5 ) for the cases considered here ,",
    "i compute @xmath85 directly using eqns . 9 - 14 and eq .",
    "32 . for fixed values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 ,",
    "the derived value of @xmath86 is approximately the same for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "an exception to this rule is when @xmath1 is large and there are very few bins .",
    "i attribute this to truncation effects associated with rounding @xmath67 to an integer ( eq .",
    "thus , one can compute @xmath85 from simulation data corresponding to one sufficiently large value of @xmath5 and predict @xmath36 at other large values of @xmath5 . as a caveat , for very short experiments , the asymptotic theory may not apply and a direct simulation may be necessary .    for the case where the dead time @xmath1 is fixed",
    ", @xmath85 varies as a function of both @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( figure 2 ) in a complicated manner . to clarify resutls ,",
    "i scale @xmath85 and @xmath0 by the true trapping rate @xmath2 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "i define @xmath87 to be the value of @xmath0 that minimizes @xmath36 .",
    "based on figure 3 , the most elucidating way to find the optimal data collection strategy is to minimize @xmath88 as a function of @xmath10 . for the cases shown in figures 2 and 3 ,",
    "i conclude that @xmath89 increases as @xmath2 increases . in a second simulation experiment ,",
    "i consider cases where @xmath2 is fixed but the dead time @xmath1 varies from case to case . for these cases , as @xmath1 increases ,",
    "so too does @xmath89 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "earlier i stated that the subsample restriction has no practical effect on data collection for neutron lifetime experiments of current interest .",
    "to make this claim more concrete , i compute the probability of observing @xmath28 in the full sample for the cases listed in table 1 . for these cases , @xmath79 0.014 s and @xmath74 1 s@xmath90 and @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "hence for an experiment of total duration 100 s , @xmath93 .",
    "in the study , i quantified @xmath35 given knowledge of @xmath2 and particular values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "in actual experiments , one would use the estimated value of @xmath2 rather than the true value .",
    "hence , in eqn .",
    "28 , one would use @xmath94 rather than the true value of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath35 is negligible , there is no need to correct @xmath22 for bias . in principle , when bias is significant , a bias - corrected maximum likelihood estimate should be obtained using the following iterative procedure : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the bias - corrected maximum likelihood estimate at the @xmath54th iteration . in practice ,",
    "one iteration of the above procedure may yield a numerically stable estimate of the bias - corrected maximum likelihood estimate for cases of interest .",
    "in this work , i studied the statistical properties of a maximum likelihood estimate of the rate at which protons are trapped .",
    "this study is relevant to proton trap neutron lifetime experiments at nist and similar experiments elsewhere .",
    "after the first proton is detected , the detector goes dead .",
    "hence , the detector provides incomplete information . due to this incompleteness",
    ", i showed that the first two moments of the maximum likelihood estimate of the trapping rate @xmath2 are infinite .",
    "hence , the variance of the maximum likelihood estimate is not defined . to construct a maximum likelihood estimate with a finite variance , i restricted attention to a subsample of realizations of the data that excludes an exceedingly rare realization of the data that yields an infinite valued estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "i demonstrated that the probability of observing this rare realization quickly decreases to a negligible value for a judicious choice of the trapping time for proton trapping rates achievable at nist ( secion 5 ) .",
    "hence , restricting attention to the subsample of interest has no practical effect on current neutron lifetime experiments of interest .",
    "based on the discrete probability density function for this subsample , i derived exact formulas for the first two moments of the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath2 ( eqns .",
    "10 and 11 ) .",
    "i derived asymptotically valid formulas for the fractional bias , fractional rms prediction error and fractional standard deviation of the maximum likelihood estimate ( eqns .",
    "28 - 30 ) .",
    "i showed that the approximation error associated with these formulas is low for a variety of cases ( tables 1,2 ) .",
    "i demonstrated that the fractional bias ( @xmath35 ) of the estimate was more sensitive to @xmath0 than the fractional mean - square prediction error ( @xmath36 ) was ( figure 1 ) .",
    "as as a function of total observing time @xmath5 , i showed that @xmath35 decreases much faster than does @xmath36 ( table 1 ) .",
    "i presented an objective method to select the optimal value of @xmath0 by minimizing @xmath36 .",
    "in general , the optimal trapping time @xmath0 that minimizes @xmath36 is a complicated function of both dead time @xmath1 and the trapping rate @xmath2 ( figures 2 - 4 ) . for experimental planning purposes , my asymptotic approximations ( eqns .",
    "28 - 30 ) should be useful for determining the optimal data collection strategy and for quantifying random and systematic errors .    in this study ,",
    "i neglected physical sources of systematic error due to effects such as a time varying proton trapping rate or fluctuations in the actual trapping stage interval about the nominal value sought by the experimenter .",
    "hence , the bias i quantified here is a purely statistical artifact due to the fact the maximum likelihood estimate of the trapping rate is a nonlinear function of the observed data .",
