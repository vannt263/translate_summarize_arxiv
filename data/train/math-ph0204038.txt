    "in the optimal prediction ( op ) methods presented in earlier work by the author and others @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , an estimate of the future solution of an underresolved problem , or of a problem where the initial data are only partially known , was obtained by solving a reduced system of equations for the conditional expectation of the solution given the partial data .",
    "this system , closely related to a generalized langevin equation of the mori - zwanzig type @xcite,@xcite , is derived in detail in @xcite .",
    "short - time estimates can be obtained by keeping only the first term on the right hand side of this system , obtaining a relation between the rate of change of a reduced set of variables and conditional expectations of the full rate of change ; a simplified derivation of this relation is given below .",
    "theorem @xcite asserts that if one starts with a hamiltonian system , then the reduced system obtained in this way is also hamiltonian , with a hamiltonian equal to a conditional free energy of the original hamiltonian system .",
    "renormalization group ( rng ) transformations @xcite,@xcite,@xcite reduce the dimensionality of a system of equations by integrating out unwanted scales . that there is a qualitative resemblance between op and rng methods is quite clear , and",
    "has been pointed out in particular in the related work of goldenfeld et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite . in the present paper we focus on the special case of hamiltonian systems in thermal equilibrium , and",
    "show that in this case the rng transformations of the hamiltonian can be obtained by integrating conditional expectations of the derivatives of the hamiltonian ; loosely speaking , rng transformations are integrals of op reductions .",
    "this remark , based on hald s theorem , makes possible the efficient evaluation of the coefficients of the new hamiltonians in rng transformations ( the \") by simple monte - carlo methods , for example by swendsen s small - cell monte - carlo rng @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the coefficients in the new hamiltonian define the reduced system of equations used to estimate the future in op .",
    "to illustrate the construction , we apply it to spin systems and obtain explicitly the parameter flows in addition to critical points , critical exponents , and order parameters .",
    "we exhibit in detail a particular implementation that is a little awkward if viewed as an instance of a rng but is particularly convenient for op .",
    "a little thought shows that what is offered in the present paper is a numerical short - cut .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a set of @xmath1 random variables ( @xmath1 may be infinite ) , and let @xmath2 ; partition @xmath3 so that @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",

    "there is no question that @xmath10 is well defined but the obvious ways of finding it can be costly .",
    "we are offering effective ways to do so .",
    "there are other situations where one wants to integrate out unwanted variables inside nonlinear functions , and our short - cut may serve there as well ; in subsequent papers we shall apply it to problems in irreversible statistical mechanics and , equivalently , to problems involving the full long - time op equations .",

    "hald s theorem asserts that the system ( 9 ) is hamiltonian , with hamiltonian @xmath74 , a relation identical to equation ( 6 ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath75 shows that the approximation ( 9 ) can not be valid for long times : the predictive power of partial initial data decays at @xmath76 for a nonlinear system , and the best estimate of @xmath77 should decay to unconditional mean of @xmath63 ( which is usually zero ) .",
    "the existence of a reduced hamiltonian shows that this decay can happen only to a limited extent and thus the approximation can in general be valid only for short times .",
    "equations ( 9 ) constitute the short time , or \" , op approximation .",
    "suppose however that instead of picking specific values for the initial data @xmath25 one samples them from the invariant density @xmath78 .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath25 s is then invariant , and equal to their marginal distribution in the full system ( 8) when the data are sampled from the invariant distribution @xmath12 , as one can also see from the identities @xmath79 .",
    "the system ( 9 ) then generates the marginal probability density of part of the variables of a system at equilibrium .",
    "thus op at equilibrium is a way of reducing the number of variables without affecting the statistics of the variables that remain .",
    "one can make short - time predictions about the future from the reduced system with coefficients computed at equilibrium because it is self - consistent to assume for short times that unresolved degrees of freedom are in thermal equilibrium , as is explained in the op papers cited above .",
    "for simplicity , we work here with real - space renormalization applied to variables associated with specific sites in a plane , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , @xmath82 are integers , all the @xmath83 are inside a square @xmath84 of side @xmath85 with @xmath85 large , and the variables are listed in some convenient order .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath86 is a function of @xmath87 , @xmath88 . the need for the superscript ( 1 ) will appear shortly .",

    "if the calculation is set up so that the mapping @xmath106 , @xmath110 can be repeated , for example , if the range of the variables @xmath87 is invariant and the hamiltonians @xmath111 can be represented in the same finite - dimensional basis , then one can produce in this way a sequence of hamiltonians @xmath112 ; the fixed points of the transformation @xmath113 for a spin system of infinite spatial extent include the critical points of the system , see any discussion of the rng , for example @xcite,@xcite .",
    "consider the special case where @xmath114 is one of the @xmath115 in its group ",
    ", replace a block of spins by one of the spins in the block .",
    "more general and widely used assignments of block variables will not be needed in the present paper and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we can identify the spins that remain with @xmath25 of the preceding section and the spins that disappear with @xmath116 .",
    "equation ( 10 ) becomes a special case of equation ( 5 ) , and can be solved for @xmath117 by taking conditional expectations of the derivatives of @xmath118 .",
    "note that the usual rng representation of a renormalized hamiltonian by means of additional couplings @xcite is interpreted here as an expansion of a conditional expectation in a convergent series .",
    "the new interpretation may be useful both in understanding what is happening on the computer and in deriving error estimates .",
    "the relation between the rng and conditional expectations shows that the latter can be calculated recursively , as we show in the example below .",
    "we have written the rng transformation above in notation suitable for spins with a continuous range .",
    "the case of discrete ( e.g. , ising ) spins is automatically included , even though it may seem odd to differentiate functions with a discrete domain and range .",
    "indeed , add to the hamiltonian @xmath119 a term of the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 is small , the sum is over all spins , the product is over a finite number of values @xmath122 , and @xmath123 has a minimum at 0 and is positive elsewhere . for small @xmath121 such a term will constrain the @xmath124 to take on the values @xmath122 , but since at the origin the derivative of @xmath125 is zero the calculation of the conditional expectations is unaffected by this term and the limit @xmath126 can be taken without actually doing anything on the computer .",

    "the spins with @xmath134 even constitute @xmath25 and the others @xmath116 ; the choice of which are even and which are odd is a matter of convention only ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "after projection , the coefficients of @xmath174 in ( 13 ) become @xmath175 @xmath176 and @xmath177 acquires the coefficient @xmath178 .",
    "if one relabels the remaining spins so that they occupy the lattice previously occupied by all the spins , group 3 becomes group 2 , group 4 becomes group 3 , and group 6 becomes group 4 ( see figure 2 ) .",

    "add to the terms which are functions of @xmath25 additional terms which are functions of @xmath25 and are chosen so that after relabelling they acquire the form of terms already in the series ( just as above , terms that depend on @xmath183 , for example , become terms that depend on @xmath184 after relabelling ) .",

    "this is a renormalization step , and it can be repeated .    note that it if one wants to reduce the number of variables by a given factor , one can in principle use an analogous rng / conditional expectation construction and get there in one iteration ; the recursive construction is easier to do and the intermediate hamiltonians , whose coefficients constitute the parameter flow in the renormalization , contain useful information .",
    "the discussion so far may suggest that one sample the hamiltonians recursively , i.e. , start with @xmath118 , find @xmath117 , use monte - carlo to sample the density @xmath185 and find @xmath186 etc .",
    "the disadvantages of this approach are : ( i ) the sampling of the densities @xmath187 can be much more expensive for @xmath188 than for @xmath189 because each proposed monte - carlo move may require that the full series for @xmath182 be summed twice ; and ( ii ) each evaluation of a new hamiltonian is only approximate because the series are truncated , and , more important , the monte - carlo evaluation of the coefficients may have limited accuracy .",
    "these errors accumulate from step to step and may produce false fixed points and other artifacts .",
    "the remedy lies in swendsen s observation @xcite,@xcite that the successive hamiltonians can be sampled without being known explicitly .",
    "sample the original hamiltonian , remove the unwanted spins and relabel the remaining spins so as to cover the original lattice , as in the relabelling step in the renormalization ; the probability density of the remaining spins is @xmath185 ; repeating @xmath1 times yields samples of @xmath190 .",
    "the price one pays is that to get an @xmath46 by @xmath46 sample of @xmath187 one has to start by sampling a @xmath191 by @xmath191 array of non - renormalized spins , where @xmath192 is either @xmath193 or @xmath194 depending on the parity of @xmath1 and on programming choices ; the trade - off is in general very worthwhile .",
    "what has been added to swendsen s calculation is an effective evaluation of the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath163 from the samples .",
    "the programming here requires some care . with the decimation scheme as in figure 1 ,",
    "after one removes the unwanted spins in @xmath195 the remaining spins , the variables @xmath196 , live on a lattice with a mesh size @xmath197 larger than before ; after relabelling they find themselves on a lattice with the same mesh size as before but arranged at a @xmath198 angle with respect to the previous lattice . to extract a square array from at this set of spins one has to make the size of the box that includes all the spins half the size of the previous box . at the next renormalization one obtains @xmath199 which can be extracted from @xmath195 by taking one spin in four and",
    "the resulting box size is the same as the size of the box that contains @xmath196 .",
    "one may worry a little about boundary conditions for @xmath196 : the periodicity of @xmath195 is not the same as the periodicity one has to assume for @xmath196 because of the rotation ; the resulting error is too small to be detected in our calculations .",
    "we now present some numerical results obtained with the rng / conditional expectation scheme .",
    "the problem we apply the construction to is ising spins ; more interesting applications will be presented elsewhere .",

    "this table represents the parameter flow and if the functions @xmath204 are written in terms of the variables @xmath208 the table defines the new system of equations for the reduced set of variables .",
    "remember that in the projection on @xmath29 additional functions are used so that after relabelling the series has the same terms , but maybe with different coefficients , as before the renormalization . in @xmath118 , @xmath209 is the sole non - zero coefficient , and its value is determined by @xmath132 and the definition of @xmath184 , in particular the presence of the coefficient @xmath210 ( see above ) .",

    "the derivatives of the expectations are given by correlations as follows : @xmath248\\over\\displaystyle \\partial\\alpha_j ^{(n ) } } = e\\left[\\varphi_k(x^{(n+1)})\\varphi_j(x^{(n)})\\right]- e[\\varphi_k(x^{(n+1)})]e[\\varphi_j(x^{(n)})],\\ ] ] @xmath248\\over\\displaystyle \\partial\\alpha_i ^{(n+1 ) } } = e\\left[\\varphi_k(x^{(n+1)})\\varphi_i(x^{(n+1)})\\right]- e[\\varphi_k(x^{(n+1)})]e[\\varphi_i(x^{(n+1)})],\\ ] ] see @xcite . in most of the literature on real - space renormalization for ising spins the variables @xmath196 are obtained from @xmath195 by `` , i.e. , by assigning to the group that defines @xmath196 the value @xmath127 if most of the members of the group are @xmath127 , the value @xmath128 if most of the members of the group are @xmath128 , with ties resolved at random . for",
    "the decimation scheme described above our '' rule ( @xmath196 is one of the members of the group ) is identical to the majority rule .",
    "there is an apparent difficulty in the decimation because at each recursion the number of terms in the summation that defines the basis functions is reduced by half while the square root of an integer is not in general an integer , so that one has to perform swendsen sampling on rectangles so designed that the ratio of the areas of two successive rectangles is 1/2 .",
    "this has not turned out to be harmful , and the value of @xmath249 , the correlation exponent , was found to be @xmath250 ( the exact value ) @xmath251 with @xmath252 monte - carlo moves per spin , the error depending mainly on the number of monte - carlo moves which has to be very large , in line with previous experience @xcite .",
    "we also checked that in a renormalization scheme where a @xmath253 block of spins is replaced at each iteration by a single spin , the `` and our '' rule for @xmath196 yield similar results .",
    "one needs fewer terms in the expansion of the hamiltonian to get accurate values of the exponents than to get an accurate parameter flow , but a larger number of monte - carlo moves .",
    "we have presented a simple relation between conditional expectations for systems at equilibrium on one hand and the rng on the other , which makes it possible to find efficiently the coefficients in a reduced systems of equations for a subset of variables whose distribution as given by reduced system equals their marginal distribution in the original system .",
    "the numerical results above emphasized the neighborhood of the critical point in the simple example because this is where the variables are strongly coupled without separation of scales and a reduction in system size requires non - trivial tools .",
    "the next steps will be the application of these ideas to time - dependent problems and to finite - difference approximations of underresolved partial differential equations , along the lines suggested in @xcite ; this work will be presented elsewhere .",
