    "generalization of some well - known stochastic processes indexed by a single parameter to processes indexed by two parameters has attracted considerable interest recently .",

    "these processes can be regarded as extension of the gaussian processes with cauchy covariance used in geostatistics . for simplicity , we call such processes the gaussian field with generalized cauchy covariance ( gfgcc ) . here",
    "we would like to point out that one should not confuse such a process with a stable process with cauchy marginals .    in general",
    ", processes parametrized by two indices can provide more flexibility in their applications in modeling physical phenomena .",
    "in particular , the gfgcc model has an additional nice and useful property as it allows separate characterization of fractal dimension and long range dependence ( lrd ) by two different indices .",

    "models based on a stochastic process or field parametrized by a single index seem inadequate .",

    "the main aim of this paper is to study gfgcc and its anisotropic counterpart , which we call gaussian sheet with generalized cauchy covariance ( gsgcc ) . in view of the fact that gfgcc is widely used in geostatistics and other applications @xcite",

    "our approach to this subject is mainly from a physical viewpoint .",
    "basic sample properties such as the long range dependence and the local self - similarity properties of gfgcc and gsgcc are investigated .",
