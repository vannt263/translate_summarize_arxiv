    "then there is a natural bijection @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 denotes the longest element of @xmath26 ) , and this map is an isomorphism of posets between the _ strong bruhat order _ on @xmath26 restricted to @xmath36 and the root order on @xmath33 .",

    "however , if @xmath0 belongs to the third infinite family of minuscule posets ( see the classification at the end of the introduction ) , the same triple exhibits the cyclic sieving phenomenon for all positive integers @xmath41 .",

    "when @xmath0 arises from a lie algebra with root system of type @xmath51 , for instance , theorem  [ main1 ] reduces to a result of stanley in @xcite coupled with theorem 1.1(b ) in reiner - stanton - white @xcite , and it is recorded as theorem 6.1 by striker and williams in @xcite .",
    "the case when the root system is of type @xmath52 turns out to be handled almost identically , and it is recorded as corollary 6.3 in @xcite .",

    "if @xmath0 is a finite poset , it is shown by cameron and fon - der - flaass in @xcite that the fon - der - flaass action @xmath3 may be expressed as a product of the involutive generators @xmath53 for a larger group acting on the poset of order ideals @xmath2 .",
    "for all @xmath54 and @xmath4 , @xmath55 is obtained by _ toggling @xmath56 at @xmath57 _ , so that @xmath55 is either the symmetric difference @xmath58 , if this forms an order ideal , or just @xmath56 , otherwise . in @xcite , striker and williams named this group the _ toggle group_.    on the other hand , there is a natural labeling of the elements of a minuscule poset @xmath0 by the coxeter generators @xmath59 for the weyl group @xmath26 , which is given by stembridge in @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath0 is a minuscule poset , there exists a labeling of @xmath0 such that the linear extensions of the labeled poset ( which is called a _ minuscule heap _ ) index the reduced words for the fully commutative element of @xmath26 representing the topmost coset @xmath60 .",

    "second , it indicates a correspondence between coxeter elements in @xmath26 and sequences of toggles in @xmath67 : the choice of a linear ordering on the coxeter generators @xmath68 yields a choice of the following .    *",

    "the proofs of theorem  [ secondary1 ] and theorem  [ secondary2 ] are carried out in section 6 ; sections 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 provide the requisite background .",
    "we did not manage to adapt the techniques developed in these sections for the proof of theorem  [ main2 ] , so in sections 7 - 11 we adopt a less theoretical approach , suppressing most of the details .",
    "full proofs may still be found in the reu report @xcite . in section 7",
    ", we review ordinary and symmetric plane partitions , which provide a convenient framework for analyzing order ideals of @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "then sections 8 , 9 , and 10 cover the cases corresponding to the first , second , and third infinite families , respectively .",
    "the claim of theorem  [ main2 ] for the two exceptional cases is checked by computer in section 11 , using the software developed by dilks . while the proofs of the results which we assemble into theorem  [ main2 ] are purely combinatorial",

    "in this section , we obtain the fact that the cyclic sieving phenomenon holds for all posets of the form @xmath368 \\times [ n])/s_2 \\times [ 2]$ ] as a consequence of the fact that the cyclic sieving phenomenon holds for all posets of the form @xmath92 \\times [ n ] \\times [ 2]$ ] .    note that the fon - der - flaass action on ordinary plane partitions viewed as order ideals of @xmath92 \\times [ n ] \\times [ 2]$ ] restricts to the fon - der - flaass action on symmetric plane partitions viewed as order ideals of @xmath368 \\times [ n])/s_2 \\times [ 2]$ ] .",
