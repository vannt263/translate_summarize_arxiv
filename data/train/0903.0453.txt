    "magnetic dipole - dipole interactions play a fundamental role in magnetic phenomena .",
    "their long range nature gives rise to magnetic domains in ferromagnets . on the other hand , because of their weak strength , they usually play an insignificant role in determining the curie temperatures and in critical phenomena of atomic crystals . in assemblies of magnetic nanoparticles ( nps ) , things can be very different .",
    "because ferromagnetic nps of up to thousands of bohr magnetons have a single magnetic domain , @xcite dipole - dipole interactions among such nps can be very large , and can thus dominate their collective behavior.@xcite often , both the orientation of the crystallites of which nps are made as well as their positions are disordered in the assembly , and therefore behave much as a system of interacting magnetic dipoles with randomly oriented magnetic easy axes .",
    "these systems of random axes dipoles ( rads ) are clearly frustrated , since two different dipoles give rise to magnetic fields at any given point which are not in general collinear .",
    "the sort of time dependent behavior that is expected of spin glasses has been observed in experiments@xcite as well as in simulations@xcite of disordered assemblies of magnetic nps . because these systems evolve in time very slowly ( exhibiting aging@xcite and other memory@xcite effects ) , evidence for a _ thermodynamic _ spin glass phase in them is more difficult to come by .",
    "one of us has recently given numerical evidence for the existence of an equilibrium spin glass phase for a _ fully _ occupied lattice of dipoles with randomly oriented axes.@xcite on the other hand , numerical evidence against such a phase has been given for site _ diluted _ lattice systems of magnetic dipoles with _",
    "axes.@xcite    one might expect a site diluted systems of rads to behave as fully occupied ones , and therefore to have equilibrium spin glass phases at low temperatures . for support of this expectation ,",
    "consider rescaling distances in a dilute system of rads . because dipole dipole interactions decay with distance @xmath10 as @xmath11",
    ", letting @xmath12 merely redefines dipole - dipole interaction energies as @xmath13 .",
    "this would imply all physical quantities for systems of rad s in three dimensions ( 3d ) with different values of site concentration @xmath3 collapse onto the same curve when plotted versus @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the temperature .",
    "this argument holds for randomly located rad s on a _ continuous _ space in 3d .",
    "it is therefore expected to hold approximately for a site diluted _ lattice _ if @xmath16 , but not necessarily for lattices with higher concentrations of rads .",
    "this is why dipoles with parallel axes can have an antiferromagnetic phase at low temperature on a fully occupied simple cubic lattice,@xcite but appear to have no condensed phase of any sort on a very dilute lattice.@xcite similarly , the existence of a spin glass phase for rads for @xmath17 does not follow from its existence for @xmath18 .",
    "our main aim here is to find , by means of the parallel tempered monte carlo ( tmc ) algorithm,@xcite whether an equilibrium spin glass phase exists in a site diluted system of rads in 3d .",
    "we also aim to establish , if the spin glass phase does exist , whether in the condensed phase ( 1 ) there is a single extended state,@xcite as in a ferromagnet or in the droplet model of spin glasses,@xcite or ( 2 ) there are multiple extended states , as in the xy model in 2d@xcite or in the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) theory of spin glasses.@xcite    the paper is planned as follows . in sect .",

    "we provide numerical evidence for the existence of an equilibrium spin glass phase below a transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the evidence comes from the behavior of the distribution of the spin overlap parameter @xmath5.@xcite in analogy to the behavior of the xy model in 2d , @xmath24 seems to vanish in the macroscopic limit in the spin - glass phase , but only as a power of system size . for both @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a nearest neighbor ( nn ) dipole - dipole interaction energy which is defined in sect .",

    "we treat systems of magnetic dipoles on simple cubic lattices .",
    "we place a dipole on each lattice site with probability @xmath3 , and leave the site unoccupied with probability @xmath29 .",
    "each dipole points along a randomly oriented anisotropy axes . with this model",
    "we aim to mimic assemblies of nps in which uniaxial anisotropy energies are an order of magnitude larger than the largest dipole - dipole energy .",
    "then , anisotropy energy barriers are not so large as to freeze spin reorientations near the spin glass temperature , but are sufficiently large to restrict spins to point `` up '' or `` down '' approximately along the easy magnetization axes .",
    "we term this the random - axes - dipolar ( rad ) model .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by , @xmath30 where the first sum is over all occupied sites @xmath31 and @xmath32 of a simple cubic lattice , @xmath33 is the @xmath34 component of a classical 3-component spin on site @xmath31 , @xmath35 @xmath36 is the distance between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath2 is an energy , and @xmath37 a nearest neighbor distance .",
    "each spin points along a randomly chosen direction .",
    "these equations can be cast into a form that is manifestly ising like by letting @xmath38 be ( 1 ) a null vector if the @xmath32 site is unoccupied and ( 2 ) a @xmath39component unit vector chosen randomly from a spherically uniform distribution if the @xmath32 site is occupied , and defining a pseudospin @xmath40 for each site , such that @xmath41 .",
