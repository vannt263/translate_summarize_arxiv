    "after schnabl s discovery of the analytic solution @xcite , open string field theory have established as a non - perturbative formulation of string theory .",

    "the value of the classical action exactly matches with the d - brane tension .",
    "absence of open strings around closed string vacuum is also shown by the so - called homotopy operator @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite also triggers broad interest in string field theory .    although basic features of sen s conjecture have already shown , analytic solution for tachyon condensation is still important to investigate various problems in string theory .",
    "the solution defines string field theory around closed string vacuum as @xmath1 = s[\\psi + \\psi_{sc}]\\label{063334_14apr10}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 denotes schnabl s solution and @xmath3 is the action of witten s cubic sft @xcite . in principle , many important problems could be investigated by this action .",
    "for example , one can show the absence of open string , as have been done in @xcite .",
    "other d - branes such as lower dimensional d - branes or multiple d - branes are also expected to be constructed as classical solutions .",
    "more nontrivial issue is closed strings .",
    "although the action ( [ 063334_14apr10 ] ) lacks physical excitation of open strings , it is expected that the action can describe closed string physics through open / closed duality on the world sheet .",
    "however , at our knowledge , such applications of schnabl s solution are quite few at present ; the analysis of the homotopy operator , evaluation of the gauge invariant closed string operator @xcite and the boundary state @xcite .",
    "one reason which prevent us from extensive research around closed string vacuum is the complexity of schnabl s solution .",
    "it is given by @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a string field composed by particular insertions of conformal ghost and anti ghost .",
    "the existence of of isolated piece @xmath5 , called phantom piece , forces us to take delicate limit of large @xmath6 in the evaluation of physical quantities such as classical action .",
    "recently , a very simplified version of the classical solution for tachyon condensation is given by erler and schnabl @xcite .",
    "their solution is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are string fields which belong to a subspace of the star algebra @xcite which is called ` @xmath0 subalgebra ' .",
    "the phantom term is no more absent in their solution .",
    "the sum in schnabl solution is replaced with an integral over the width of semi - infinite strip .",
    "such simplification makes calculations easy therefore might be useful to investigate various problem in sft .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the basis of string field used in @xcite to evaluation of the classical and effective tachyon potential .",
    "we employ same gauge condition as that of erler - schnabl solution ( [ 151830_12apr10 ] ) to string field . within the @xmath0 subalgebra ,",
    "this leaves unique choice @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a polynomial of @xmath8 .",
    "the power expansion of @xmath12 corresponds to level truncation with respect to the ` dressed ' @xmath13 operator which is defined by an anticommutator of @xmath14 with the gauge condition . then , following similar procedure shown in @xcite , it is straightforward to evaluate the classical action for @xmath15 . surprisingly , it turns out that the level truncation stops at finite level if we only allow a field configuration such that leaves the value of the action finite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 , we give a brief review of the @xmath0 subalgebra and the basis of string field in which we are working .",

    "we omit the @xmath18 symbol for star product as as in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the brst operator acts on these string field as @xmath19 with the help of this algebra , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found a solution of equation of motion .",
    "the solution has a very simple expression as @xmath20 using ( [ 144136_25mar10 ] ) and ( [ 144158_25mar10 ] ) , it is straightforward to show that this solution satisfies the equation of motion @xmath21 .",
    "the authors of @xcite also have shown that the classical action correctly reproduce d - brane tension . in order to do this",
    ", they rewrote the @xmath22 factor in ( [ 144214_25mar10 ] ) as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the wedge state , which represents a semi - infinite strip of width @xmath25 in the sliver frame .      the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also argued the gauge condition which their solution obeys .",

    "it is not difficult to check ( [ 144214_25mar10 ] ) with the help of formulas @xmath30 we would like to consider general form of string field in this gauge .",
    "it is soon realized that a ghost number 1 field in this gauge can be obtained by a slight modification of erler - schnabl solution , i.e. , @xmath31 where @xmath12 is an arbitrary function of @xmath8 is real valued function of @xmath8 .",
    "however , there always exists ` real form ' of this string field given by @xcite @xmath32 as explained in @xcite , this string field is gauge equivalent to the non - real form .",

    "second solution can be obtained by canceling two terms in ( [ 145011_15apr10 ] ) each other . a solution in this case",
    "is given by @xmath44 which is nothing but erler - schnabl solution .",
    "the third one is obtained by setting @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 we give a discussion about this new solution in the end of section 3 .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the classical action ( or equivalently classical potential ) @xmath47 + \\frac{1}{3 } { \\mathrm{tr}}[\\psi^3]\\ ] ] in our setting of string field given by ( [ 153249_25mar10 ] ) .",
    "all of the calculation can be preformed by employing a procedure developed in ref.@xcite .",

    "we assign ` level ' @xmath48 to the @xmath48th order term in @xmath12 , since the corresponding string field is an eigenstate of ` dressed ' @xmath49 operator with eigenvalue @xmath50 .",

    "thus the integrals in @xmath69 can be preformed with the replacement @xmath70 where @xmath71 also represents the width of the world sheet .",
    "the integration measure can also be rewritten into @xmath72 after integrating out @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we obtain the potential as an integral with respect to the width @xmath76 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is finite order in @xmath76 , possibly includes negative powers of @xmath76 .",
    "we are now ready to evaluate the classical potential up to arbitrary level . in principle , all the calculation can be done by hand , but software such as _ mathematica _ is useful to evaluate the derivatives and integrals which appear in @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we find that the order of @xmath76 in the integrand of ( [ 142318_26mar10 ] ) decreases as level increases .",
    "to illustrate this , we introduce a notation in which the @xmath76 dependence of each coefficients in the potential is manifest .",
    "@xmath81 for example , @xmath82 is evaluated up to level 4 as @xmath83 first coefficient which includes negative power of @xmath76 is @xmath84 this factor is divergent in the potential since an integral @xmath85 is proportional to gamma function @xmath86 , which is known to be divergent .",
    "similarly , any terms with negative power of @xmath76 diverge due to poles of gamma function at negative integer .",
    "the cubic coefficient @xmath87 also diverges as level increases .",
    "however , as seen in table [ 152434_27mar10 ] , negative power of @xmath76 is absent up to level 3 . therefore ,",
    "if we restrict @xmath12 in ( [ 153249_25mar10 ] ) to be polynomial in @xmath8 , and also require finite coefficients in the classical action , its maximal level is three .",
    "in other words , level truncation terminates at level 3 .",
    "this is quite different from the situation in siegel gauge or schnabl s @xmath26 gauge , where level expansion does nt terminate .    .a",
    "complete list of @xmath88 up to level 3 .",
    "other coefficients are zero .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the expected closed string vacuum , stable in this case , is in the last row of table [ table : v2 ] .",
    "curiously , another stable vacuum shallower than the closed string vacuum appears in the first row .",
    "we will discuss possible interpretation of this vacuum later .",
    "we can further integrate out @xmath89 from @xmath90 by solving equation of motion . in this case , @xmath91 can not be solved uniquely as a function of @xmath92 since @xmath93 is no more linear in @xmath91 .",
    "this yields four nontrivial branches .",
    "first , we would like to pick a branch which is connected to the closed string vacuum , which is our major concern .",
    "we can substitute @xmath89 to the solution of equation of motion to obtain effective potential @xmath94 . again",
    "the analytic expression is quite long to show here .",
    "we show a plot of the potential in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dpotential ] .    .",
    "we have chosen a branch which connects with the closed string vacuum . ]    as seen in the plot , the closed vacuum at @xmath95 is stable and correctly reproduce the d - brane tension @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , we observed that the potential can not be extended to negative value of @xmath97 due to singularity at @xmath98 . for negative @xmath97 ,",
    "the potential becomes complex valued . in earlier results based on the level truncation in siegel gauge or @xmath26 gauge , the potential is valid only in a compact region of tachyon field , typically starts from slightly before unstable point @xmath98 and terminates at some value of @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "our result seems to be more natural since potential exactly starts from the unstable vacuum .",
    "there are no roll off of the tachyon field towards negative value of the tachyon field .",
    "such feature of the effective potential completely agrees with the physical picture of unstable d - brane that have been conjecture in @xcite the closed string vacuum is the endpoint of the d - brane decay .",
    "we can also solve @xmath91 in other branches in similar way . a result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : branches ] .    .",
    "we find local minimum in branch 2 and 4 .",
    "branch 3 consists of two disconnected curves . ]",
    "the branch 4 is the closed string vacuum branch which is already shown in fig .  [ fig:1dpotential ] .",
    "it is seen that none of the branches are extended to the negative @xmath97 region beyond singularity at origin .",
    "we also found two nontrivial branch points @xmath99 and @xmath100 by numerical inspection .",
    "such branch points are found by scanning a discontinuity of the imaginary part of @xmath89 as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "then we exclude a region in which @xmath91 is not real .",
    "one can see that the branch 3 and 2 both terminate at @xmath99 , and also another part of branch 3 is connected with branch 1 at @xmath100 smoothly .",
    "all branches share common features already mentioned for the closed string vacuum branch ; neither a runaway direction seen in @xcite , nor small deviation of tachyon field towards negative @xmath97 axis @xcite is seen .    in closing this section ,",
    "let us compare our result from level expansion with that of full equation of motion ( [ 145011_15apr10 ] ) .",
    "both methods share the string vacuum solution , @xmath101 , remaining solutions in level expansion have no counterparts in the analysis of full equation of motion .",
    "it is not surprising since equation of motion in level truncated action does not necessary coincides with full equation of motion .",
    "a rather surprising result is the alternative solution in full equation motion , @xmath102 in ( [ 223303_20apr10 ] ) .",
    "it is not shown up as a stationary point of the level expanded action .",
    "furthermore , it does not satisfy equation of motion contracted with itself , since @xmath103 = 3 \\left(-\\frac{15}{\\pi ^4}+\\frac{1}{\\pi ^2}\\right).\\ ] ] which can be easily calculated from the classical potential ( [ 214404_27mar10 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that this solution is ill - defined .",
    "in our setting , there is an identity based solution , appears in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath104    the equation of motion can be easily checked if one remember @xmath105 .",
    "as is well known , a regularization is needed to evaluate physical quantity such as classical action .",
    "we apply a naive regularization via narrow width limit .",
    "@xmath106 with this regularization , it is very easy to evaluate the classical action .",
    "first , the quadratic term is given by @xmath107 .\\ ] ] the order of limits is important .",
    "the limit with respect to @xmath76 taken to be first since it originates from @xmath14 , which does not changes width of the world sheet",
    ". therefore we take @xmath108 limit first .",
    "next , we set @xmath109 before sending them to zero .",
    "it turns out that the trace does not depends on @xmath110 , so without taking @xmath111 limit we have @xmath112 similarly , the cubic term @xmath113\\ ] ] can be evaluated by setting @xmath114 without taking limits . @xmath115",
    "the sum of the quadratic term with the cubic term must vanish since it is an equation of motion contracted with itself . @xmath116.\\ ] ] however , as is clear from ( [ idq ] ) and ( [ idcube ] ) , it does nt vanish .",
    "therefore @xmath15 is not a classical solution in our regularization . the reason is easily understood from the fact that each traces have different width .",
    "in this paper , we performed level expansion of string field within the @xmath0 subalgebra .",
    "we find that the level expansion terminates at level 3 .",
    "it is found that the closed string vacuum is a saddle point of the classical potential . as for the effective potential",
    ", we confirmed that it is bounded from below , and exactly starts from perturbative vacuum .",
    "an expression of classical action in terms of total strip width @xmath76 , @xmath117 is important , since this tells us which width of world sheet is most dominant in the classical action . in principle , this kind of expression also appears in schnabl solution @xcite ( given as sums rather integrations ) and marginal deformation @xcite , but the multiple integrals or sums with respect to strip width is very difficult to perform completely .",
    "the simplicity of the @xmath0 subalgebra enable us to perform multiple integration .",
    "tremination of level expansion is also impressive .",
    "although we restrict @xmath12 to be polynomial in this paper , we can also consider a case of certain series in @xmath8 such as @xmath118 .",
    "this example can be treated by introduction of schwinger parameter .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate classical action for such string field .",
    "we should note that our result for tahcyon physics is only limited in very limited subspace spanned by @xmath0 subalgebra .",
    "our results may change by inclusion of other modes outside @xmath0 subalgebra .",
    "however , we have done systematic analysis under certain gauge condition , so we believe that our analysis is useful to get insight about physics of tachyon condensation .",
    "especially , we believe that the effective tachyon potential obtained in this paper will help an attempt to derive exact form of the effective potential , which is not yet available in csft .",
    "it will also be interesting to compare our potential with those derived from bsft @xcite or s - matrix method @xcite",
    ".    the @xmath0 subalgebra will be very useful for other proposes .",
    "extension of this subalgebra to fields with nonzero momentum will be useful to investigate physics around closed string vacuum .",
    "multiple d - branes or lump solutions will also be interesting .",
    "application to the gauge invariant overlap is also important to understand closed sting physics in terms of open string fields .",
