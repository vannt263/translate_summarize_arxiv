    "the photoelectric effect , i.e. , the emission of an electron after the absorption of a photon , is one of the most fundamental processes in the interaction of light with matter . the progress in the creation of ultrashort light pulses during the last decade ( see @xcite for a review ) has enabled the time - resolved study of photoemission with attosecond precision ( @xmath2s ) @xcite .",
    "one of the most important experimental techniques is attosecond streaking @xcite which is a pump - probe scheme that employs a phase - controlled ( few - cycle ) infrared ( ir ) field and an extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) attosecond pulse to determine the arrival time of the photoelectrons in the continuum .",
    "closely related techniques include rabbit ( `` reconstruction of attosecond harmonic beating by interference of two - photon transitions '' ) @xcite and the attosecond clock for ( close to ) circularly polarized fields @xcite . in the following we will review recent developments in the understanding of time delays in photoemission as probed by attosecond streaking and present results on the transition from short - ranged to long - ranged atomic potentials corresponding to the transition from photodetachment to photoionization .",
    "we also report on the effects of the @xmath1 shell on streaking of photoemission from the central atom of an endohedral complex a@@xmath1 .",
    "atomic units are used throughout the manuscript unless indicated otherwise .",
    "to simulate streaking experiments we numerically solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for a single - active electron .",
    "we employ the well - established pseudo - spectral split - operator method @xcite using a finite - element discrete - variable - representation ( fedvr ) @xcite for the discretization of the wave function in coordinate space . the interaction with the linearly - polarized laser fields",
    "is treated in the length form of the dipole approximation .",
    "we have carefully tested the numerical convergence of our simulations regarding box size , radial discretization , angular momenta basis , and time - stepping .    from the numerical calculations we extract the absolute streaking time shifts @xmath3 by fitting the first moments ( or peak positions ) of the final momentum distribution @xmath4 , which depends on the delay time @xmath5 between the xuv and ir pulses ( see ) , to the ir - modified momentum , @xmath6 using an iterative , nonlinear least squares algorithm , where @xmath7 is the unperturbed asymptotic momentum of the photoelectron , @xmath8 is the vector potential of the ir field , and @xmath9 is a correction factor for the amplitude of the momentum shift induced by the streaking field",

    "the graphs show the final momentum distribution integrated over an opening angle of @xmath12 in `` forward '' direction of the laser polarization axis for an @xmath13 initial state and an xuv photon energy of 100ev ( duration @xmath14 fwhm ) .",
    "the solid white line is the first moment of the final electron momentum spectrum which follows the vector potential of the ir laser field ( solid red line ) ( ) . the small shift @xmath3 between the two curves ( see ) is revealed in the inset . [",

    "direction ( at @xmath15 ) with respect to the laser polarization axis then @xmath16 , while @xmath17 for analysis in `` backward '' direction ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the sign convention for @xmath3 implies that _ positive _ ( negative ) values correspond to _ delayed _ ( advanced ) emission relative to the center of the xuv pulse .",
    "typically , averaging the photoelectron spectra over a finite opening angle mainly affects the constant @xmath9 and has only little effect on @xmath3 .",
    "however , if the photoelectrons have a pronounced anisotropic angular distribution , also the streaking delays @xmath3 may become significantly angle - dependent .",
    "the physical principle underlying attosecond streaking is that for photoemission in the presence of a few - cycle ir field the final momentum ( or energy ) of the photoelectrons emitted by the xuv pulse is shifted as a function of the delay time between the xuv and ir pulses ( ) . this delay time @xmath5 can be experimentally controlled with high accuracy leading to a temporal resolution for @xmath3 close to the single - attosecond scale @xcite . the challenge in interpreting the streaking time shifts obtained lies in disentangling the intrinsic timing of the photoionization process in the absence of the ir probe field , the so - called eisenbud - wigner - smith ( ews ) delay @xcite , from additional probe - field induced contributions .    for photoemission",
    "the ews delay is given by the spectral derivative of the dipole matrix element , @xmath19 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the energy of the photoelectron and @xmath21 is the dipole transition operator between the initial bound state @xmath22 and the final scattering state @xmath23 describing photoemission into the solid angle ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "alternatively , the ews time delay can be directly extracted from the motion of the outgoing electronic wave packet @xcite created by the xuv pulse .",
    "after the wave packet has left the scattering region , the time evolution of its radial expectation value @xmath25 ( or the position of its crest ) eventually follows asymptotically @xmath26 the motion of a free particle delayed by the time @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the group velocity of the photoelectron wave packet .",
    "the ews time delay @xmath27 can thus be extracted from the intercept of the linear extrapolation of @xmath25 with the @xmath30 axis @xcite , @xmath31 however , one key condition of the applicability of eqs .",
    "[ eq : ews_def_matel ] - [ eq : ews_rkt ] is that the binding potential is short - ranged such that the wave packet reaches , indeed , the free - particle motion at large distances @xcite .",
    "note that just as for the streaking delays @xmath3 the sign convention for @xmath27 in eqs .",
    "[ eq : ews_def_matel ] - [ eq : ews_rkt ] is such that _ positive _ ( negative ) values correspond to _ delayed _ ( advanced ) emission .    in general , the measured streaking time shifts @xmath3 do not give direct access to the ews time @xmath27 ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : ews_def_matel ] and [ eq : ews_rkt ] ) .",
    "several additional contributions have been identified @xcite , @xmath32 where the coulomb - laser coupling ( clc ) term @xmath33 stems from the simultaneous interaction of the coulomb field and the external laser field on the outgoing electron @xcite , while the dipole - laser coupling terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 result from the polarization of the atomic initial state or the final ionic state , respectively @xcite .",
    "the three additive correction terms to the ews time have in common that they are all induced by the simultaneous presence of the ir streaking field .",
    "their relative importance depends on the electronic structure of the residual atomic or molecular complex from which the photoelectron is emitted .",
    "the clc contribution originates from the interplay between the coulomb - like long - ranged part of the binding potential and the ir field .",
    "one of its key properties is its independence of the atomic species .",
    "it only depends on the photoelectron energy , the asymptotic ionic charge @xmath36 , and the wavelength of the ir field and can therefore readily be taken into account for a given experiment or simulation .",
    "note that an analogous term has also been identified for the complementary , interferometric rabbit technique @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the clc contribution is a direct consequence of the long - range nature of the coulomb potential where , strictly speaking , ews delays as given in or are not well - defined ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) due to the logarithmic divergence of the energy and position dependent phase of the coulomb wave , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the asymptotic momentum , @xmath39 the angular quantum number , and @xmath40 the @xmath41-independent term , often referred to as the `` coulomb phaseshift '' or `` coulomb phase '' , is the coulomb analogue to the phase shift in standard scattering theory for short - ranged potentials and its spectral derivative determines the ews delay for photoionization ( ) which reduces to @xmath42 if only a single partial wave in the continuum is accessed .",
    "the additional logarithmic distortion of the wavefront ( ) gives rise to an additional time shift @xmath43 that depends on the radial coordinate @xmath41 or , likewise , on the time @xmath30 since @xmath44 , @xmath45 = \\frac{z}{(2e)^{3/2 } } \\left[1 - \\ln ( 4 e t ) \\right]\\ , .\\ ] ] therefore , for coulomb potentials ews delays as obtained from the expectation value ( crest position ) of the radial wave packet ( ) do not converge to a finite value as @xmath46 and always depend on the time of evaluation ( ) .",
    "however , it is exactly the time shift @xmath43 ( ) that gives rise to the @xmath33 contribution in streaking ( ) .",
    "key is that the streaking laser field maps the @xmath47 contribution onto the streaking time shift , however , only for a short time interval @xmath48 covering a small fraction of the ir laser field period @xmath49 , @xmath50 , within which the ir field changes relatively little .",
    "it has been numerically shown @xcite that the clc contribution for a wide range of @xmath36 and @xmath20 is accurately given by @xmath51 with @xmath52 . for short - ranged binding potentials as in the case of photodetachment",
    "the clc contribution ( ) is absent . in view of the fact that the clc contribution to the streaking time is sensitive only to that portion of the atomic binding potential that is probed within the time interval @xmath48 ,",
    "it is of conceptual interest to probe the transition regime from short - ranged to long - ranged potentials .",
    "we consider binding potentials that are still asymptotically short - ranged , however , mimicking the coulomb potential over longer distances for which the traversal time of the emitted electron may become comparable to @xmath48 .",
    "we explore this connection in for an exponentially screened coulomb potential with varying screening length .",
    "+ turning to the residual correction terms in , the dipole - laser coupling contributions @xmath34 and @xmath35 in become important when the initial or final ionic states are highly polarizable @xcite . for special cases , i.e. , initial or final states in degenerate hydrogenic manifolds , analytical expressions for their values",
    "can be given @xcite . clearly , the final state dipole - laser coupling term @xmath35 is only present for multi - electron systems .",
    "one example of the latter type will be discussed below for photoemission from the central atom of an endohedral complex a@@xmath1 where the polarization of the buckyball strongly influences the streaking time .",
    "in a previous contribution @xcite we have shown that for photodetachment from short - ranged exponentially screened coulomb ( or yukawa ) potentials , @xmath53 with screening lengths @xmath54 of the order of a typical atomic radius , the streaking time shifts @xmath3 equal the ews time shifts @xmath27 , and thus reduces , in the absence of any dipole - laser coupling , to ( see ) @xmath55 in contrast , for photoionization from long - ranged coulomb potentials @xmath56 the streaking time shifts @xmath3 and the ews delays @xmath27 do not agree ( ) and the additional ir - field induced contribution , @xmath33 ( ) , is present @xmath57     ( ) and ews delays @xmath27 ( , ) for photoionization ( or photodetachment ) of an @xmath58 initial state for different photon energies from a @xmath59 coulomb potential ( red ) with @xmath60 and a yukawa potential ( blue ) with the screening length @xmath61 ( ) .",

    "we perform streaking simulations for several xuv energies and varying screening lengths @xmath54 ( ) . in all cases the charge @xmath36 in is adjusted to keep the ionization potential @xmath62 of the initial @xmath58 state at the constant value @xmath63 to allow comparison with ionization from the ground state of the coulombic @xmath59 ion .",

    "the streaking ir laser field has a wavelength of 800 nm , a duration of 3fs , and an intensity of @xmath10w/@xmath11 .",
    "the streaking time shifts @xmath3 approach the coulomb limit ( solid black line ) for @xmath65 .",
    "the agreement with the ews time shifts @xmath27 ( dash - dotted lines ) , which do not continuously reach an asymptotic limit , gradually decreases for @xmath65 .",
    "the ews delays @xmath27 for the yukawa potential do not converge to the coulomb ews delay ( ) in the limit @xmath65 since the logarithmic @xmath41-dependent term ( ) due to the long - range potential tail is not included in the definition of the coulomb ews delay.[fig : yukawa_limit ] ]    as the parameter @xmath54 gets larger , the curves for the ews delays are shifted to larger negative delays ( ) . while for small @xmath54 excellent agreement between the ews delays and the streaking time shifts persists ( ) , noticeable deviations appear for larger @xmath54 .",
    "those discrepancies between @xmath27 and @xmath3 depend on the energy of the photoelectron where the lower energies are more heavily affected .",
    "finally , the streaking time shifts become insensitive to a further increase of the screening parameter @xmath54 . at that point",
    "they converge to the streaking delays as obtained for the @xmath59 coulomb potential which corresponds to the @xmath67 limit in .",
    "[ fig : yukawa_t_streaking ] and [ fig : yukawa_limit ] highlight the finite range of the atomic binding potential attosecond streaking is capable of probing .",
    "the coupling to the probing ir field is sensitive to the binding potential close to the atomic core but not at asymptotic distances .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate for @xmath33 ( ) @xcite .",
    "the time interval @xmath48 during which the coulomb - laser coupling is effective corresponds to a traversal time of the electron through the atomic force field , @xmath68 . in turn , the range @xmath54 that can be probed ( @xmath69 for the results presented in ) depends on the electron velocity @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( since @xmath48 depends on @xmath71 , cf . ) .",
    "photoemission from the central atom of an endohedral buckyball a@@xmath1 represents an interesting and challenging case of attosecond streaking of a complex many - electron system .",
    "the confinement resonances closely related to exafs ( extended x - ray absorption fine structure ) have been detected in the spectral domain @xcite .",
    "they are expected to leave their signature on the streaking spectrogram in the time domain as well . however , in this complex system additional effects including final - state dipole laser coupling ( ) , screening , and transport have to be accounted for .",
    "we first model the @xmath1 cage by a spherically symmetric square - well potential @xmath72 that the photoelectrons encounter after photoionization .",
    "the model potential for the shell is given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the inner - radius of the @xmath1 shell , @xmath75 is its width , and @xmath76 the potential depth .",
    "the short - ranged admixture @xmath72 ( ) to the coulomb potential of the confined atom ( ) leads to an energy dependent modulation @xmath77 of the intrinsic atomic time delay @xmath78 , @xmath79 on the fully coherent one - electron level .",
    "the modulation @xmath77 is the signature of the confinement resonances ( ) .    to facilitate the quantitative comparison with the atomic results ( ) we study @xmath59@@xmath1 .",
    "we note that this ionic rather than neutral central atom would not be stable .",
    "the resulting streaking delays for the endohedral fullerenes nicely reflect the oscillations due to the confinement resonances ( ) which implies that @xmath80 is fulfilled to a high degree of accuracy for this model system .",
    "a more realistic treatment of streaking for endohedral fullerenes includes the modification of the external ir field due to its interaction with the @xmath1 cage .",
    "first , the streaking ir field will be considerably screened in the inside of the fullerene , and second , the @xmath1 shell is highly polarizable .",
    "the first effect bears resemblance to streaking of photoelectrons from surfaces @xcite where electrons are effectively exposed to the streaking field only after traversing condensed matter and exiting the surface .",
    "in the present case , the surface is provided by the fullerene shell . to estimate the influence of the screening inside the @xmath1 cage on the streaking delays we perform classical trajectory calculations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) where the probing ir field is completely suppressed inside the cage . the resulting correction term ( ) ,",
    "i.e. , the difference of the streaking time shifts to those without screening is large and is of the order of @xmath81 .",
    "quantum mechanical simulations for a screened potential lead to virtually the same results ( not shown ) .",
    "the size of the screening correction is determined by the runtime the liberated photoelectron needs until reaching the streaking field outside the fullerene ( i.e. , the apparent birth time in the continuum is delayed ) . moreover , the clc term is modified since contributions from the logarithmic phase term ( ) are only acquired for @xmath82 ( cf . ) .",
    "the ir - field induced polarization of the residual @xmath1 cage gives rise to a strong dipole - laser coupling the photoelectron encounters after leaving the buckyball .",
    "the additional induced dipole potential outside the @xmath1 cage @xmath83 is determined by the dipole moment @xmath84 where @xmath9 is the polarizability of @xmath1 . a classical trajectory simulation of streaking in the resulting spatially inhomogeneous dipole field yields a strong negative time shift , @xmath85 , which is much larger than its atomic analogue ( ) .",
    "it is of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "again , quantum - mechanical streaking simulations featuring an additional external dipole field lead to virtually the same delay times as the classical simulations",
    ". remarkably , screening and polarization effects are both large but of opposite sign partially canceling each other .",
    "consequently , attosecond streaking of photoionization of endohedral fullerenes @xmath0@@xmath1 does not only probe the ews time shift ( ) but is also sensitive to the run - time of the photoelectron in the screened @xmath1 cage and to the induced - dipole field of the ir - field polarized buckyball .",
    "we have reviewed time - resolved photoemission as probed by attosecond streaking and analyzed the relation between the measured or simulated streaking time @xmath3 and the intrinsic atomic eisenbud - wigner - smith ( ews ) time delay @xmath27 .",
    "several ir - probe field induced contributions can be accounted for .",
    "they include the coulomb - laser coupling ( clc ) and the dipole - laser coupling ( dlc ) .",
    "we have investigated how the clc time shift is modified in the transition from short - ranged to long - ranged potentials .",
    "we have found that attosecond streaking probes only the part of the binding potential close to the nucleus .",
    "furthermore , we could show that the confinement resonances in the ionization of endohedral fullerenes can be probed in the time domain using attosecond streaking .",
    "we identified corrections due to screening of the probing infrared field inside the @xmath1 cage and the dynamical polarization of @xmath1 by the streaking field .",
    "further theoretical studies of this scenario with the help of density - functional theory are under way aiming for the non - linear response of the buckyball to the ir field and a more realistic model for the @xmath1 scattering potential .",
