    "study of the structure and stellar content of the nuclear bulge  is extremely difficult as it is one of the most highly obscured regions of the galaxy .",
    "the nuclear bulge is estimated to contain a narrow layer of molecular hydrogen throughout its extent with scale height @xmath13 and a total mass of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , this accounts for only half of the extinction between the observer and the galactic centre as it is estimated that there is an equal amount of material between the sun and the nuclear bulge  as there is within the nuclear bulge  in the direction of the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "if this material were distributed homogeneously over the sky , it would result in visual extinction of @xmath15 .",
    "numerous authors have measured the extinction in the visual and near - infrared and found the level of extinction to be @xmath16 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that only @xmath17 of the interstellar medium is distributed homogeneously throughout the nuclear bulge  and the remaining @xmath18 is contained within dense clouds filling only a few percent of the nuclear bulge  @xcite .",
    "the relationship between extinction and wavelength is governed by the composition of the material causing the extinction ; in most cases , this is a diffuse mixture of gas and dust ( small grains and molecules ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is known as the `` extinction law '' . in the visual wavelength regime ,",
    "the extinction law is generally expressed as the ratio of absolute to relative extinction @xmath19 . in the near - infrared wavelength",
    "range the extinction law is described by a power - law relationship , @xmath20 , and can be expressed either as a ratio of relative extinctions @xmath21 or , as the slope of the power - law @xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) .    the original , and generally applied , extinction law for the diffuse interstellar medium ( i.e. : not dense , known molecular clouds ) was calculated in the 1980s using relatively primitive ( by today s standards ) infrared detectors and using a small sample of individually selected stars whose spectral types were well known @xcite .",
    "based on the small sample of sources for which they had spectral observations , they expressed the near - infrared extinction law as `` universal '' , a notion that has been adopted in almost all studies since .",
    "there have been many values given for the extinction law , with values of @xmath21 ranging from 1.28 to 2.09 @xcite ; however , this variation has been attributed to the different magnitude systems being used ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an example of photometric systems affecting the extinction law determination ) .",
    "up to this point the possibility that the underlying extinction law could vary on small scales had not been considered extensively .",
    "however , in the last decade , as infrared detector technology has advanced , it has been possible to obtain much higher - resolution , deeper surveys of the sky in the infrared band ( _ 2mass _ , _ denis _ , _ ukidss _ , _ vista _ ) . based on these observations ,",
    "it has become evident that the extinction law is not `` universal '' as previously thought , but is in fact highly variable from point - to - point @xcite .",
    "this variation is most evident towards the bulge and in denser regions such as molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown there is variation in the extinction law within their observations of the nuclear bulge .",
    "they measure @xmath22 , equivalent to an @xmath23 for the outer regions of the bulge , but they find a spatial variation with values of @xmath3 of 1.96 , 1.97 , 2.09 and 1.91 for the north - east , south - east , north - west and south - west regions respectively .",
    "@xcite demonstrated how the assumption of a power law extinction - wavelength relationship can be manipulated to provide equations to measure that relationship given photometry in three wavebands ; this is the method we will utilize in this paper .",
    "they applied this method to the galactic anti - centre using data from _ 2mass _  @xcite and found a large spread in the measured extinction law parameter @xmath3 .",
    "however , when calculating the absolute extinction , they took an average of the spread in extinction law parameter to convert from colour excess to extinction .",
    "most recently , @xcite showed in observations of the outer regions of the galactic bulge that the conversion factor between near - infrared and visual extinction was much higher ( @xmath2416 , compared to the canonical value of @xmath259 ) than previous studies implied , indicative of a steeper extinction law slope ( a higher value of @xmath3 ) .",
    "the first large scale extinction mapping of the nuclear bulge  in the near - infrared was undertaken by @xcite using @xmath26 and @xmath27 from observations on the 1.9 m telescope at saao sutherland .",
    "they measured the modal colours and magnitudes from histograms of all the stars in in @xmath28 cells , and compared these values to the giant branch of 47 tuc to measure @xmath29 .",
    "they observed a general trend of increasing extinction levels towards zero latitude in the plane , and also made a `` hand - drawn '' map of the distribution of dark clouds obscuring all background sources in their observations .",
    "additionally , in a number of the histograms of colours and magnitudes of the stars , they observed a double peak in the distributions indicating more than one source of extinction along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite used data from the _ denis _ survey of the bulge to form an extinction map with a resolution of @xmath30 .",
    "they used a two - to - one over - sampling , so for their resolution they were sampling stars within a @xmath31 radius .",
    "they used the extinction law of @xcite to convert their measured colours to absolute extinction .",
    "they measured @xmath12 as high as 30 , although in many regions this was only a lower limit as in high extinction regions the majority of sources were obscured , especially in @xmath0 .",
    "they also reported the presence of a clumpy and filamentary distribution to the areas of high extinction , especially close to the plane .",
    "the last large - scale extinction mapping of the bulge before this work was performed by @xcite over @xmath32 using data from _",
    "2mass_. they sampled @xmath33 regions and measured extinction ranging from @xmath6 = 0.005 at edges of the region to @xmath6 = 3.2 close to galactic centre .",
    "as with the @xcite map , they observed a general reduction in the level of the extinction away from the plane , and also a filamentary structure to the regions of highest extinction .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , the extinction in the near - infrared  is generally accepted to have a power law relationship to wavelength :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "we use a similar method for measuring the extinction law and the value of absolute extinction as outlined and discussed in @xcite .",
    "colour excess , @xmath36 , for an object is the difference between the observed colour for that object , and its intrinsic colour if there were no extinction :    @xmath37    as the observed magnitudes are a function of the intrinsic magnitude and the extinction at that wavelength , @xmath38 , the colour excess becomes    @xmath39    which allows the colour excess to be expressed as a function of two wavelengths and the dimensionless constant @xmath35    @xmath40    using eq .",

    "initial reduction ( flat - fielding , removal of bad pixels , and sky subtraction ) was performed with the eso / isaac pipeline reduction software .",

    "we use g , k and m type stars as these are the most common stellar types in the nuclear bulge .",
    "we also set a threshold limit of 5 stars within the @xmath48 sampling box as a minimum for the number of stars required for the scripts to calculate a specific extinction .",
    "if there are fewer than this number in the sample region , the value for that point for both the @xmath48 and @xmath49 sampling is set to the average value measured for the whole field .",
    "the colour excess ratios for each grid point were then used to identify the value of the extinction law parameter @xmath3 by comparison to tables of values generated using equation [ e : extlaw ] .",

    "the binning for the histograms is 0.05 in values of @xmath3 ; the error in the fit of the gaussian to the histogram is comparable to one histogram bin .      using the value of @xmath3 measured at each point in the fields , we calculated the absolute extinction from the colour excesses using equation [ e : ext1 ] to obtain a value for @xmath35 and equation [ e : ext ] to calculate the extinction for each wavelength .",

    "each pixel in these images corresponds to one of the grid points separated by 5  as outlined in section [ s : calcext ] , and the colour scale represents @xmath72 .      in order to test the significance of the variation in the extinction law , we re - ran our extinction calculation twice , once allowing the value of the extinction law parameter @xmath3 to vary from field to field but not within the field and a second time using the mean extinction law parameter for all of the fields , @xmath73 ( see figure [ f : alfhisto ] ) . to measure the effects",
    ", we compared how the value of absolute extinction calculated using equations [ e : ext ] changes for the different colour excesses ( for example : the difference between @xmath8 calculated from @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) .",

    "for the fully varying , v - nice extinction calculation method that we are presenting in this paper , the @xmath76 test returned values in the range @xmath78 , indicating that the variation between the measures is within one or two @xmath79 of the distribution for almost all cases ( table [ t : extcompare ] ) . allowing the extinction law to vary from one field to another , but not within the field , we find that the differences in the values of absolute extinction calculated from different colour excesses result in a @xmath76 test returning results of @xmath80 .",
    "this illustrates that there is a statistically significant difference between the distributions of absolute extinction calculated for each wavelength from the two applicable colour excesses when keeping the extinction law constant across individual fields rather than allowing it to vary within a given field .",
    "in other words , if the value of @xmath3 is held constant over the 2.5 arcmin@xmath81 of any one vlt field , different values of the absolute extinction ( i.e. : @xmath8 ) will be calculated depending upon which colour excess is used ( i.e. : @xmath74 or @xmath75 ) .",
    "this illustrates that it is important to allow for variation in the extinction law on as small a scale as is possible for any dataset to derive the most accurate measure of the extinction in a given field .",
    "the final re - run of the extinction calculation used a single extinction law , fixed at the average value for all the fields ( @xmath82 ) as measured in figure [ f : alfhisto ] , to convert colour excess to absolute extinction for all 26 of the vlt fields .",
    "this is similar to the method that has previously been used to calculate the extinction throughout the galaxy where variations in extinction law have rarely been taken into account . in this case",
    "there were obvious differences in the calculated values of absolute extinction from the different colour excesses , revealed by the @xmath76 test which returned values of @xmath83 .",
    "we note that the value of the extinction law parameter @xmath3 that we measure from our data is significantly different from the more generally accepted value @xmath84 ( * ? ? ?",

    "here we consider that the method that we use to calculate the extinction law parameter may be affecting the measured value . in equation [ e : extlaw ]",
    ", it is assumed that the filters in the telescope system used are infinitely thin , whereas in reality they admit light over a range of wavelengths with varying efficiency , the transmission profile .",
    "it is possible that in sampling a larger bandwidth of the stellar spectra than only at the central wavelengths as assumed in our methods ; the filter transmission profiles are the cause of the difference of our measured values of @xmath3 from previous studies .    to explore this , we simulated the effects of using both a narrow idealized filter , as assumed in our extinction calculation method , and the real transmission functions of the vlt - isaac filters as given on the eso website ] . to simulate the narrow filters we used thin gaussians with peak transmission efficiency of 1 and width of @xmath85 centred on the quoted central wavelengths of the vlt - isaac filters . for the actual filter case",
    ", we could only apply the filter transmission functions as there is no comprehensive data available on the eso website which takes into account the additional effects of the atmosphere , telescope and instrument optical path on light transmission in vlt - isaac .",
    "experience suggests that these effects will be predominately attenuation of the light transmitted through the system and so the filter transmission function will have the largest effect on variation in the measured extinction .",
    "we used a sample of stellar spectra , g , k and m type giants from the @xcite libraries , and applied extinction to all spectra with a power - law wavelength dependence @xmath20 .",
    "we used @xmath86 for the extinction applied to the spectra as that is the most commonly used value for extinction in the near - infrared  and it also allows us to compare the results to the values we measured with our v - nice method .",
    "we then used the ` iraf ` package ` synphot ` ] to pass the extincted standard star spectra through the two filter sets described above .",
    "we used the magnitudes output by the ` synphot ` package for the different filters to calculate colour excess for the spectral types , and from the colour excess calculated the extinction law parameter @xmath3 using equation [ e : extlaw ] .",

    "the variation in the measured extinction law corresponded to variation in the spectral types of the stars , earlier type stars resulted in a lower measured value of @xmath3 , and later types resulted in a higher measured value of @xmath3 ( within the range given above ) .    to average the effects of the different spectral types , and to recreate our actual method used to calculate extinction , namely sampling a variety of stars over a region of the sky , we selected 4050 random spectral types , adding 5% noise to the measured magnitudes in all three bands , and calculated an average value for the extinction law for the combined colours of the stars .",
    "in 1000 repetitions , we measured a value of @xmath95 ( the error being consistent with the random noise added to the simulated magnitudes ) .",
    "we have identified two significant sources of potential error in the calculation of the extinction in the near - infrared .",
    "first , there may be substantial significant variation in the extinction - wavelength power - law relationship parameter @xmath3 ( where @xmath96 ) and in the absolute value of extinction @xmath77 , especially in heavily extinguished regions of the galactic bulge and plane .",
    "second , the measured values of @xmath3 are influenced by the transmission profile of the instrument used to obtain the photometric data on which the extinction calculation is based .",
    "we have applied our new v - nice extinction calculation method which measures variation on small spatial scales in both the extinction law and the absolute extinction to fields distributed `` randomly '' throughout the nuclear bulge , avoiding known regions of star formation and structures such as the arches and other clusters . as such",
    ", these fields offer a deeper , representative sample of the `` general '' nuclear bulgepopulation than it has been possible to obtain from previous observations such as _ 2mass_. as we have demonstrated in @xcite , this method produces self - consistent measures of the extinction that can recover real photometric values for the extinction corrected stars .",
    "until similar analysis can be undertaken on forthcoming near - infrared  observations of the entire nuclear bulge , using data from the ukidss and vista surveys , this work represents the most generalised and representative study of the extinction of the overall nuclear bulge .      in all fields we see variation in the measured extinction law on scales of @xmath97 , which is also the scale of the granularity measured in @xcite .",
    "we measure a broad range of values of the extinction law parameter , in the range @xmath98 . fitting a gaussian to the extinction law parameter distribution , we find that the extinction law in the nuclear bulge  can be described in the most general terms of @xmath73 with a standard deviation of @xmath99 ( see figure [ f : alfhisto ] ) .",
    "we tested the variation in the extinction law parameter as measured with vlt - isaac , table [ t : extcompare ] shows the effect of the variation on the calculated absolute extinction when using different colour excesses . only in the case of allowing full variation of the extinction law",
    "are the absolute extinction values calculated from different colour excesses the within @xmath100 limits . for the cases of a more general extinction law , a single value for each field and a single value for all fields , the differences introduced by the calculation of absolute extinction from different colour excesses are beyond what can be explained as statistical variations in the distributions ( i.e. : differences greater than @xmath100 ) . additionally , in @xcite",
    ", we demonstrate that the use of a fully variant extinction law is the only way to obtain consistent photometry for stellar sources in our vlt  fields and , by extension , throughout the nuclear bulge .",
    "we see considerable levels of variation in the measured absolute extinction on very small scales resulting in overall extinction ranges in the near - infrared  of @xmath9 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the spread of the measured values of absolute extinction are similar for all three bands .",
    "each has a small amount of very low levels of extinction , a large fraction centred on a single value , with a `` plateau '' of increasing values of extinction with a final , very small high extinction tail .",
    "that these distributions are similar , with the shorter wavelength distribution `` stretched '' indicates that all three near - infrared  bands are measuring the same extincting material distribution .",
    "the variations we measure are on scales of @xmath97 , the same scales at which we measured variation in the stellar distribution in @xcite .",
    "we interpret the distribution of different values of extinction as representing the distribution of these dense , obscuring clouds identified in our previous paper .",
    "the largest peak in all three distributions , at the lower end of the overall extinction distribution represents the `` field '' value away from these extincting structures , the higher extinction `` plateaux '' represent the extinction in the denser regions , the size scale of which we measured in @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to consider both the size of these structures , and their distribution when calculating the extinction in the nuclear bulge  as applying a `` field '' value for the extinction could underestimate extinction by a factor of 23 if the target is close to or in one of these dense , complex regions .",
    "the values of @xmath6 are we measure similar to the values that have previously been measured , with the majority of the @xmath6 distribution in the region of 13 ; however , due to the variable and generally greater value of the extinction law parameter @xmath3 , the values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 in this work are considerably higher than have previously been measured .",
    "both our calculation of the extinction from different colour excesses ( section [ s : nonvary ] ) , and the extinction correction of stars in @xcite for photometric identification indicate that this higher value of the extinction law parameter @xmath3 and the small scale variations are the correct method to use in the nuclear bulge .",
    "the higher value of @xmath3 means that previous works ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) which quoted values of @xmath12 based on measures of extinction in the near - infrared will have significantly underestimated the values of @xmath12 . as an example , the most commonly used conversion factor from near - infrared to visual is @xmath103 @xcite ; more recently @xcite have reported that in areas of the outer bulge , they measured a higher conversion factor of @xmath104 .",
    "using the conversion factors of @xcite and @xcite to derive the mean relation between @xmath6 and @xmath12 , our work would suggest a conversion factor of @xmath105 in the nuclear bulge  for @xmath106 , 3 times higher than the most commonly used value .",
    "we recommend that wherever possible , i.e. if data from at least three infrared bands is available for a given location , a specific calculation of the extinction be carried out to obtain accurate stellar photometry in heavily extinguished regions of the sky such as the nuclear bulge .",
    "due to the very small scale , real variation that we measure in the extinction law in this region , it is extremely important that as local a value as possible is measured .",
    "using our v - nice method allows for the very small spatial variations in the extinction law parameter @xmath3 as well as the absolute extinction , producing the most accurate measure of the extinction at different wavelengths in the near - infrared .      as seen in section [ s : filters ] , the transmission function of the filter - set used in observations has an effect on the value of the extinction law parameter measured using our method .",
    "the results suggest that only for an idealized very thin filter profile will the `` real '' value of the extinction law be measured using this method . for the broader filter profiles of real instruments , the spectral slope of the star",
    "being observed will influence the value of the extinction law measured .",
    "the spatial variations in the extinction law that we observe are not affected by this property , only the exact numerical value measured for @xmath3 .",
    "the result of this is that the extinction law parameter @xmath3 and the absolute extinction measured from a set of observations using a unique telescope - instrument setup can only be applied to data from other observations using the same telescope - instrument combination without the need to account for the filter transmission .",
    "if the extinction correction values measured from one dataset are applied to data from observations obtained using other telescope - instrument combinations , an error will be induced by the differing filter transmissions .",
    "we have studied the extinction in the near - infrared  in a sample of representative regions of the nuclear bulge  based on observations with vlt - isaac .",
    "we have found a high degree of spatial variability in both the extinction law parameter @xmath3 as well as the absolute extinction in these regions . we have used a new method , a variable near - infrared  colour excess , v - nice , to measure these variations .",
    "only when the value of the extinction law parameter @xmath3 as well as the absolute extinction is allowed to vary can self - consistent values for the extinction at different wavelengths in the near - infrared  be calculated .    for our observations , using vlt - isaac , the peak of the extinction law parameter @xmath3 s distribution for the nuclear bulge  is at a higher value than previously thought , described by a gaussian with @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we allowed the extinction law to vary when calculating the absolute extinction at different wavelengths from colour excesses and show that only when this variation is allowed can self - consistent levels of extinction be recovered .",
    "the variations of both the extinction law parameter @xmath3 and the absolute extinction are seen on scales as small as @xmath4 .",
    "we measure extinction in the near - infrared  of @xmath9 , @xmath101 and @xmath64 . the higher overall value of the extinction law parameter @xmath3 results in a higher conversion factor between @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that previously derived levels of @xmath77 in the nuclear bulge  from near - infrared  extinction measures may need to be reconsidered .",
    "we have also found that the extinction law parameter @xmath3 has a dependency on the transmission function of the instrument .",
    "we simulated the effects of the instrument filter transmission profiles on the measured value of the extinction law parameter @xmath3 and showed that in the case of idealized narrow filters , our method recovers the true value of the extinction law , but for the real isaac filter transmission profiles , the result measured is @xmath109 below the true value .",
    "the effects of the small scale variation in the extinction law as well as the absolute extinction are the dominant source of errors when correcting for extinction in the nuclear bulge .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that the potential for small - scale physical variations in the extinction should be considered when performing photometry in any significantly extinguished area of the galactic bulge or plane .",
    "the method presented here is sufficient to obtain accurate stellar photometry for multi - colour data from any near - infrared  telescope - instrument combination , and can be used to correct for extinction to allow identification of stellar types by comparison to photometric standards .",
    "the exact extinction values measured will be relative to the telescope - instrument combination . unless the absolute value of extinction law is required , or the measured extinction will be used to correct the colours of stars from datasets from other combinations of telescope and instrument , the effects of the filter transmission effects discussed here need not be considered .",
    "however , if the measured extinction law value is used to reddening - correct data from different telescope - instrument combinations , the user should be aware of the errors that will be induced by the different filter transmission profiles .    due to these two effects",
    ", we suggest that the use of a generic `` universal '' ir extinction law is not appropriate in many cases , especially when observing regions of the galaxy known to suffer significant extinction .",
    "we recommend that whenever possible , a local extinction calculation should be undertaken as this provides the most accurate possible photometry for bulge stars @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the measure of granularity from @xcite be used to determine the scale at which the extinction is variable and this be used to determine a limit to the area over which stars can be sampled in calculating the extinction .",
    "the methods we present here are an effective and accurate way of calculating the extinction for a dataset to correct the extinction towards sources in the nuclear bulge  in the near - infrared .",
