    "the absolute calibration of the instrument ( including atmosphere ) requires careful attention .",
    "derived from the measurement of the mutual degree of coherence of the incident radiation field , on spatial frequencies sampled by the aperture - array configuration , the final interferometric observables are non - linear mixes of noisy quantities , and of parameter estimates with their own uncertainties .    in this paper , we propose to revisit and extend the existing data processing and calibration methods , in the aim to obtain reliable estimates and robust uncertainties for calibrated measurements of visibility and complex triple product .",
    "the careful reduction process , described in the present paper , has been elaborated for the scientific study of a sample of 18 bright cool giant and supergiant stars ( see table  [ tabscience ] ) .",
    "measurements were obtained with the vlti / amber facility at medium spectral resolution ( @xmath0=1500 ) in the @xmath1 band , using triplets of 1.80-m auxiliary telescopes .",
    "observations have been conducted during 15 observing nights between may 2009 and december 2010 ( under belgian visa guaranteed time ) .",

    "however , @xmath2 is clearly non - null in some parts of the spectrum , and this is a hint for a deviation from centro - symmetry . to rule out the contradiction , and",
    "so as to consider this latter possibility , we introduce a new estimator , that we call the _ centro - symmetry parameter _ ( csp ) , similar to the global closure phase , but using instead the absolute value of @xmath2 in the numerator , and the modulus of @xmath3 in the denominator , @xmath4 as for the global closure phase , a small csp value ( less than , for our sample ) suggests a high degree of centro - symmetry .",
    "significantly high csp values , as judged from their uncertainties ( bootstrap method again ) , require to use asymmetric brightness distribution models , for the fitting on the spi data .",

    "increasing symmetrically around zero ( w  ori ) .",
    "for each of these situations , the integration over the spectrum produces a nearly null result ( hint for centro - symmetry ) .",
    "however the csp allows to detect deviations from centro - symmetry ( see fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : psicsp ] shows the csp in @xmath1 displayed versus the global closure phase in the same spectral band , for each science target , choosing the ob which gives the smallest uncertainty on the csp .",
    "almost all the stars fall along the diagonals of the ( @xmath17 , csp ) diagram , which trace the relation csp  =  @xmath18 .",
    "one ( w  ori ) , however , is flagged as asymmetrical with the csp indicator , but not with @xmath17 .",
    "this is precisely why we favour the csp over @xmath17 , as discussed above .",
    "t  cet has the largest values for csp and @xmath17 as well , indicating large deviation from centro - symmetry ( may be due to strong asymmetries at the wavelengths of the co  bands or even suggestive of the presence of a binary companion ) .",
    "the second largest csp value pertains to r  scl , recently revealed as a wide binary by @xcite , using the alma array at millimetric wavelengths . in addition",
    ", the last column of table  [ tabcspclos ] shows that , except for t  cet , the snr for the csp is comparable or larger than the snr for the global closure phase .",
    "in order to interpret the final calibrated spi observables , _ spidast _ provides a fitting routine , based on the modified gradient - expansion algorithm , very similar to the algorithm invented by @xcite , and improved by @xcite .",
    "the fit applies on any calibrated spi measurements ( to be chosen between visibility , flux , coherent flux , bispectrum , triple product , and closure phase ) , using a library of single - component or composite parametric chromatic models , characterised by the fourier spectrum of their intensity distribution , and the associated first - order partial derivatives w.r.t .",
    "the model parameters . figure  [ figdelophfit ] shows examples of visibility - fitting results obtained with _",
    "spidast _ , using two models ( ud and ld - marcs ) .",
    "this fitting routine , applied on spectro - photometric data , is used to determine the calibrator angular diameters from the marcs + turbospectrum synthetic spectra ( see subsect .",
    "[ subseccaldiam ] ) .",
    "note that the _ litpro _ software , developed by the jmmc working group `` model fitting '' , uses a set of elementary geometrical and center - to - limb darkening functions , as well @xcite .",
    "however , it does not offer , contrary to _ spidast _ , the possibility to fit stellar - disk models with synthetic tabulated radiance data ( or exitance , for fits on spectro - photometric measurements ) , such those produced by the marcs + turbospectrum code .",
    "since the uncertainties of the final calibrated data are not normally distributed , the covariance matrix , that comes out of the chi - squared fit , can not be used to infer the parameter uncertainties @xcite . to compute the uncertainties , _ spidast _ uses the residual - bootstrap method , described in detail in @xcite :    1 .",
    "`` synthetic '' datasets are produced from random sampling with replacement of the pearson residuals ( difference between calibrated and fitted values divided by the uncertainty of the observed value ) , added to the initial fitted values ; 2 .",
    "fitting the model on these new datasets produces a set of chi - squared minima , following a probability distribution , from which we extract the boundaries of the confidence interval , with a given confidence level ; 3 .",
    "the parameter values associated with these chi - squared boundaries give the upper and lower limits of the parameter estimates , leading to asymmetric uncertainties .",
    "the whole procedure allows the computing of reliable estimates of the parameter uncertainties .",
    "in the present paper , we introduce the new _ spidast _ software , developed since 2006 with the aim to reduce , calibrate , and interpret the visibility and triple product measurements obtained with the vlti / amber facility .",
    "_ spidast _ contains a whole set of modules , which can be launched separately or in an automatic batch file , and summarised herafter :    1 .   the raw data reduction used by _",
    "spidast _ computes the weighted average of non - aberrant data , at spectral - channel level , providing estimates of the spi observables using an automated procedure , while the method presently used with _",
    "amdlib _ selects the `` best '' frames according to a quality threshold determined _ a posteriori _ , after several trials .",
    "2 .   the wavelength calibration procedure performed by _",
    "spidast _ provides spectral shifts following a polynomial law , tracing them at the channel level .",
    "this is done by computing the cross - correlation of the measured spectra of the calibrators with their synthetic spectra produced by the marcs model , while _ amdlib _ only provides a constant spectral shift over the spectrum , from the correlation with the telluric lines .",
    "3 .   for selected calibrators",
    "not included in the calibrator catalogues , _ spidast _ provides several routines for estimation of the angular diameter with indirect methods , the most accurate being the fit of stellar - atmosphere model spectra given by marcs on spectro - photometric data .",
    "the calibrator synthetic observables are derived using clv functions produced by marcs .",
    "4 .   to obtain an accurate interferometric calibration ( via an automated procedure ) , _ spidast _ :  ( 1 )  divides the calibrator raw data with the associated synthetic observables in each spectral channel , which gives the instrumental response function in squared visibility and triple product ;  ( 2 )  interpolates or fits the response at the time of each exposure on the science target ;  ( 3 )  divides the science raw data with the interpolated / fitted response , which gives the science calibrated observables for each exposure ;  ( 4 )  computes their weighted average over each ob . at each processing step , the uncertainties are computed thanks to the bootstrap method applied on the weighted means .",
    "5 .   using the real and imaginary parts of the calibrated triple product , _ spidast _",
    "measures the deviation from centro - symmetry of the brightness distribution of each science target in the observation spectral band , thanks to a new parameter , more sensitive to asymmetries than the global closure phase .",
    "6 .   finally , _",
    "spidast _ proposes a complete fitting tool , using a set of parametric and chromatic models , and accepting input tables of flux / intensity synthetic data .",
    "such a careful calibration process of spi data is a crucial step for their trustworthy astrophysical exploitation , which is the topic of two associated papers @xcite .",
    "parameter extraction using non - linear fits of source model , as well as aperture - synthesis image reconstruction , need reliable estimates of the calibrated observables , with robust uncertainties .",
    "our reduction , calibration , and fitting routines also apply to any other spectral datasets , including spectroscopic data .",
