    "since the us federal communications commission ( fcc ) approved the limited use of ultra - wideband ( uwb ) technology @xcite , communications systems that employ uwb signals have drawn considerable attention .",
    "a uwb signal is defined to be one that possesses an absolute bandwidth larger than @xmath1mhz or a relative bandwidth larger than 20% and can coexist with incumbent systems in the same frequency range due to its large spreading factor and low power spectral density .",
    "uwb technology holds great promise for a variety of applications such as short - range high - speed data transmission and precise location estimation .",
    "commonly , impulse radio ( ir ) systems , which transmit very short pulses with a low duty cycle , are employed to implement uwb systems ( @xcite-@xcite ) . in an ir system",
    ", a train of pulses is sent and information is usually conveyed by the position or the polarity of the pulses , which correspond to pulse position modulation ( ppm ) and binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) , respectively . in order to prevent catastrophic collisions among different users and thus provide robustness against multiple - access interference , each information symbol is represented by a sequence of pulses ; the positions of the pulses within that sequence are determined by a pseudo - random time - hopping ( th ) sequence specific to each user @xcite . the number @xmath2 of pulses representing one information symbol can also be interpreted as pulse combining gain .",
    "commonly , users in an ir - uwb system employ rake receivers to collect energy from different multipath components .",
    "a rake receiver combining all the paths of the incoming signal is called an _ all - rake _ ( _ arake _ ) receiver .",
    "since a uwb signal has a very wide bandwidth , the number of resolvable multipath components is usually very large .",
    "hence , an arake receiver is not implemented in practice due to its complexity .",
    "however , it serves as a benchmark for the performance of more practical rake receivers .",
    "a feasible implementation of multipath diversity combining can be obtained by a _ selective - rake _ ( _ srake _ ) receiver , which combines the @xmath3 best , out of @xmath4 , multipath components @xcite .",
    "those @xmath3 best components are determined by a finger selection algorithm . for a maximal ratio combining ( mrc ) rake receiver ,",
    "the paths with highest signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) are selected , which is an optimal scheme in the absence of interfering users and inter - symbol interference ( isi ) . for a minimum mean square error ( mmse )",
    "rake receiver , the  conventional \" finger selection algorithm is to choose the paths with highest signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratios ( sinrs ) .",
    "this conventional scheme is not necessarily optimal since it ignores the correlation of the noise terms at different multipath components . in other words ,",
    "choosing the paths with highest sinrs does not necessarily maximizes the overall sinr of the system .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate the optimal mmse srake as a nonconvex , integer - constrained optimization , where the aim is to choose the finger locations of the receiver so as to maximize the overall sinr .",
    "while computing the optimal finger selection is np - hard , we present several relaxation methods to turn the ( approximate ) problem into convex optimization problems that can be very efficiently solved by interior - point methods , which are polynomial time in the worst case , and very fast in practice .",
    "these optimal finger selection relaxations produce significantly higher average sinr than the conventional one that ignores the correlations , and represent a numerically efficient way to strike a balance between sinr optimality and computational tractability .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section describes the transmitted and received signal models in a multiuser frequency - selective environment .",
    "the finger selection problem is formulated and the optimal algorithm is described in section , which is followed by a brief description of the conventional algorithm in section . in section , two convex relaxations of the optimal finger selection algorithm , based on an approximate sinr expression and integer constraint relaxation techniques , are proposed .",
    "the simulation results are presented in section , and the concluding remarks are made in the last section .",
    ", @xmath5 , the time hopping sequence is \\{2,1,2,3,1,0 } and the polarity codes are \\{+1,+1,-1,+1,-1,+1}.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we consider a synchronous , binary phase shift keyed th - ir system with @xmath6 users , in which the transmitted signal from user @xmath7 is represented by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the transmitted uwb pulse , @xmath10 is the bit energy of user @xmath7 , @xmath11 is the  frame \" time , @xmath2 is the number of pulses representing one information symbol , and @xmath12 is the binary information symbol transmitted by user @xmath7 . in order to allow the channel to be shared by many users and avoid catastrophic collisions , a time - hopping ( th ) sequence @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , is assigned to each user .",
    "this th sequence provides an additional time shift of @xmath15 seconds to the @xmath16th pulse of the @xmath7th user where @xmath17 is the chip interval and is chosen to satisfy @xmath18 in order to prevent the pulses from overlapping .",
    "we assume @xmath19 without loss of generality .",
    "the random polarity codes @xmath20 are binary random variables taking values @xmath21 with equal probability ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "consider the discrete presentation of the channel , @xmath22 $ ] for user @xmath7 , where @xmath4 is assumed to be the number of multipath components for each user , and @xmath17 is the multipath resolution .",
    "then , the received signal can be expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the received unit - energy uwb pulse , which is usually modelled as the derivative of @xmath9 due to the effects of the antenna , and @xmath25 is zero mean white gaussian noise with unit spectral density .",
    "we assume that the time - hopping sequence is constrained to the set @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , so that there is no inter - frame interference ( ifi ) .    due to the high resolution of uwb signals ,",
    "chip - rate and frame rate sampling are not very practical for such systems . in order to have a lower sampling rate ,",
    "the received signal can be correlated with template signals which enable symbol rate sampling of the output @xcite .",
    "the template signal for the @xmath28th path of the incoming signal can be expressed as @xmath29 for the @xmath30th information symbol , where we consider user @xmath31 without loss of generality . in other words , by using a correlator for each multipath component that we want to combine , we can just use symbol rate sampling at each branch , as shown in figure [ fig : rec ] .",
    "note that the use of such template signals results in equal gain combining ( egc ) of different frame components . this may not be optimal under some conditions ( see @xcite for ( sub)optimal schemes ) .",
    "however , it is very practical since it facilitates symbol - rate sampling .",
    "since we consider a system that employs template signals of the form ( [ eq : temp ] ) , i.e. egc of frame components , it is sufficient to consider the problem of selection of the optimal paths just for one frame . hence , we assume @xmath32 without loss of generality .",
    "multipath components , which are combined by the mmse combiner.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    let @xmath33 denote the set of multipath components that the receiver collects ( figure [ fig : rec ] ) . at each branch ,",
    "the signal is effectively passed through a matched filter ( mf ) matched to the related template signal in ( [ eq : temp ] ) and sampled once for each symbol .",
    "then , the discrete signal for the @xmath28th path can be expressed , for the @xmath30th information symbol , as@xmath34 @xmath35 for @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38^t$ ] and @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is a @xmath41 vector , which can be expressed as a sum of the desired signal part ( sp ) and multiple - access interference ( mai ) terms : @xmath42 where the @xmath7th elements can be expressed as @xmath43_k&= \\begin{cases } \\alpha_l^{(1)},\\quad\\quad k=1\\\\ 0,\\quad\\quad\\quad\\,k=2,\\ldots , k",
    "\\end{cases}\\textrm{and}\\\\ \\left[{{\\bf s}}_{l}^{(mai)}\\right]_k&= \\begin{cases}\\label{eq : sig_vec_mai } 0,\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad k=1\\\\ d_1^{(1)}d_1^{(k)}\\sum_{m=1}^{l}\\alpha_m^{(k)}i_{l , m}^{(k)},\\,\\,\\,\\,k=2,\\ldots , k \\end{cases},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 being the indicator function that is equal to @xmath31 if the @xmath45th path of user @xmath7 collides with the @xmath28th path of user @xmath31 , and @xmath46 otherwise .",
    "the problem is to choose the optimal set of multipath components , @xmath47 , that minimizes the bit error probability ( bep ) of the system . in other words ,",
    "we need to choose the best samples from the @xmath4 received samples @xmath48 , @xmath49 , as shown in ( [ eq : r_lj ] ) .    to reformulate this combinatorial problem",
    ", we first define an @xmath50 selection matrix @xmath51 as follows : @xmath3 of the columns of @xmath51 are the unit vectors @xmath52 ( @xmath53 having a @xmath31 at its @xmath30th position and zero elements for all other entries ) , and the other columns are all zero vectors .",
    "the column indices of the unit vectors determine the subset of the multipath components that are selected .",
    "for example , for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 chooses the second and third multipath components .    using the selection matrix @xmath51",
    ", we can express the vector of received samples from @xmath3 multipath components as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vector of thermal noise components @xmath59^t$ ] , and @xmath60 is the signature matrix given by @xmath61^t$ ] , with @xmath62 as in ( [ eq : sig_vec ] ) .",
    "using ( [ eq : sig_vec])-([eq : sig_vec_mai ] ) , ( [ eq : r1 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mai part of the signature matrix @xmath60 .",
    "then , the linear mmse receiver can be expressed as @xmath65 where the mmse weight vector is given by @xcite @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the correlation matrix of the noise term : @xmath68    the sinr of the system can be expressed as @xmath69 hence , the optimal path / finger selection problem can be formulated as @xmath70 where @xmath51 has the previously defined structure .",
    "note that the objective function to be maximized is not concave and the optimization variable @xmath51 takes binary values , with the previously defined structure . in other words , two major difficulties arise in solving ( [ eq : optprob ] ) globally : nonconvex optimization and integer constraints .",
    "either makes the problem np - hard .",
    "therefore , it is an intractable optimization problem in this general form .",
    "instead of the solving the problem in ( [ eq : optprob ] ) , the  conventional \" finger selection algorithm chooses the @xmath3 paths with largest individual sinrs , where the sinr for the @xmath28th path can be expressed as @xmath71 for @xmath49 .    this algorithm is not optimal because it ignores the correlation of the noise components of different paths .",
    "therefore , it does not always maximize the overall sinr of the system given in ( [ eq : sinr ] ) .",
    "for example , the contribution of two highly correlated strong paths to the overall sinr might be worse than the contribution of one strong and one relatively weaker , but uncorrelated , paths .",
    "the correlation between the multipath components is the result of the mai from the other users in the system .",
    "since the optimal solution in ( [ eq : optprob ] ) is quite difficult , we first consider an approximation of the objective function in ( [ eq : sinr ] ) . when the eigenvalues of @xmath72 are considerably smaller than @xmath31 , which occurs when the mai is not very strong compared to the thermal noise , we can approximate the sinr expression in ( [ eq : sinr ] ) as follows@xmath73 : @xmath74 which can be expressed as @xmath75 note that the approximate @xmath76 expression depends on @xmath51 only through @xmath77 . defining @xmath78^t$ ] as the diagonal elements of @xmath77 , @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 if the @xmath30th path is selected , and @xmath81 otherwise ; and @xmath82 .",
    "then , we obtain , after some manipulation , @xmath83 where @xmath84^t$ ] and @xmath85 .    then , we can formulate the finger selection problem as follows : @xmath86    note that the objective function is convex since @xmath87 is positive definite , and that the first constraint is linear .",
    "however , the integer constraint increases the complexity of the problem . the common way to approximate",
    "the solution of an integer constraint problem is to use _",
    "constraint relaxation_. then , the optimizer will be a continuous value instead of being binary and the problem ( [ eq : subopt ] ) will be convex .",
    "over the past decade , both powerful theory and efficient numerical algorithms have been developed for nonlinear convex optimization .",
    "it is now recognized that the watershed between  easy \" and  difficult \" optimization problems is not linearity but convexity .",
    "for example , the interior - point algorithms for nonlinear convex optimization are highly efficient , both in worst case complexity ( provably polynomial time ) and in practice ( very fast even for a large number variables and constraints ) @xcite .",
    "interior - point methods solve convex optimization problems with inequality constraints by applying newton s method to a sequence of equality constrained problems , where the newton s method is a kind of descent algorithm with the descent direction given by the newton step @xcite .",
    "we consider two different relaxation techniques in the following subsections .",
    "consider the relaxation of the integer constraint in ( [ eq : subopt ] ) to a sphere that passes through all possible integer values .",
    "then , the relaxed problem becomes @xmath88 note that the problem becomes a convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming ( qcqp ) @xcite .",
    "hence it can be solved for global optimality using interior - point algorithms in polynomial time .      as an alternative approach",
    ", we can relax the integer constraint in ( [ eq : subopt ] ) to a hypercube constraint and get @xmath89^l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the hypercube constraint can be expressed as @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with @xmath92 meaning that @xmath93 .",
    "note that the problem is now a linearly constrained quadratic programming ( lcqp ) , and can be solved by interior - point algorithms @xcite for the optimizer @xmath94 .",
    "we can also consider the dual problems .",
    "for the relaxation to the sphere considered in section [ sec : sphere ] , the lagrangian for ( [ eq : subopt2 ] ) can be obtained as @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "after some manipulation , the lagrange dual function can be expressed as @xmath98^t\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_n^2}{{\\bf p}}+4\\nu{{\\bf i}}\\right)^{-1 } \\\\&[{{\\bf q}}+(\\lambda+4\\nu){{\\bf 1}}]-m\\lambda,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the dual problem becomes @xmath99^t\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_n^2}{{\\bf p}}+4\\nu{{\\bf i}}\\right)^{-1}[{{\\bf q}}+(\\lambda+4\\nu){{\\bf 1}}]+m\\lambda\\\\ & \\textrm{subject to}\\quad\\nu\\geq 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be solved for optimal @xmath100 and @xmath101 by interior point methods . or , more simply , the unconstraint problem ( [ eq : subopt2_dual ] ) can be solved using gradient descent algorithm , and then the optimizer @xmath102 is mapped to @xmath103 .    after solving for optimal @xmath100 and @xmath104 , the optimizer @xmath94 is obtained as @xmath105.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    note that the dual problem ( [ eq : subopt2_dual ] ) has two variables , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , to optimize , compared to @xmath4 variables , the components of @xmath106 , in the primal problem ( [ eq : subopt2 ] )",
    ". however , an @xmath107 matrix needs to be inverted for each iteration of the optimization of ( [ eq : subopt2_dual ] ) .",
    "therefore , the primal problem can be preferred over the dual problem in this case .",
    "similarly , the dual problem for the relaxation in section [ sec : hypercube ] can be obtained from ( [ eq : subopt3 ] ) as @xmath108    it is observed from ( [ eq : subopt3_dual ] ) that there are @xmath109 variables and also @xmath107 matrix inversion operations for the solution of the dual problem .",
    "therefore , the simpler primal problem ( [ eq : subopt3 ] ) is considered in the simulations .      after solving the approximate problem ( [ eq : subopt ] ) by means of integer relaxation techniques mentioned above",
    ", the finger location estimations are obtained by the indices of the @xmath3 largest elements of the optimizer @xmath94 .    both the approximation of the sinr expression by ( [ eq : sinr2 ] ) and the integer relaxation steps result in the suboptimality of the solution .",
    "therefore , it may not be very close to the optimal solution in some cases .",
    "however , it is expected to perform better than the conventional algorithm most of the time , since it considers the correlation between the multipath components . however , it is not guaranteed that the algorithms based on the convex relaxations of optimal finger selection always beat the conventional one .",
    "since the conventional algorithm is very easy to implement , we can consider a hybrid algorithm where the final estimate of the convex relaxation algorithm is compared with that of the conventional one and the one that minimizes the exact sinr expression in ( [ eq : sinr ] ) is chosen as the final estimate . in this way",
    ", the resulting hybrid suboptimal algorithm can get closer to the optimal solution .",
    "the simulation results are performed to evaluate the performance of different finger selection algorithms for an ir - uwb system with @xmath110 and @xmath32 .",
    "there are @xmath111 equal energy users in the system ( @xmath112 ) and the users th and polarity codes are randomly generated .",
    "we model the channel coefficients as @xmath113 for @xmath49 , where @xmath114 is @xmath21 with equal probability and @xmath115 is distributed lognormally as @xmath116 .",
    "also the energy of the taps is exponentially decaying as @xmath117 , where @xmath100 is the decay factor and @xmath118 ( so @xmath119 ) . for the channel parameters , we have @xmath120",
    ", @xmath121 and @xmath122 can be calculated from @xmath123 $ ] , for @xmath49 .",
    "we average the overall sinr of the system over different realizations of channel coefficients , th and polarity codes of the users .     for @xmath124 fingers .",
    "the channel has @xmath125 multipath components and the taps are exponentially decaying .",
    "the ir - uwb system has @xmath110 chips per frame and @xmath32 frame per symbol .",
    "there are @xmath111 equal energy users in the system and random th and polarity codes are used.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in figure [ fig : sinr_vs_ebno ] , we plot the average sinr of the system for different noise variances when @xmath124 fingers are to be chosen out of @xmath125 multipath components . as is observed from the figure , the convex relaxations of optimal finger selection result in sinr values reasonable close to those of the optimal exhaustive search scheme",
    "note that the gain by using the proposed algorithms over the conventional one increases as the thermal noise decreases .",
    "this is because when the thermal noise get less significant , the mai becomes dominant , and the conventional technique gets worse since it ignores the correlation between the mai noise terms when choosing the fingers .    , for @xmath126db , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "all the other parameters are the same as those for figure [ fig : sinr_vs_ebno].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    next , we plot sinr of the proposed suboptimal and conventional techniques for different finger numbers in figure [ fig : sinr_vs_m_2 ] , where there are @xmath129 multipath components and @xmath126 .",
    "the number of chips per frame , @xmath130 , is set to @xmath131 , and all other parameters are kept the same . in this case , the optimal algorithm takes a very long time to simulate since it needs to perform exhaustive search over many different finger combinations ( therefore not implemented ) .",
    "the improvement using convex relaxations of optimal finger selection over the conventional technique decreases as @xmath3 gets large since the channel is exponentially decaying and the most of the significant multipath components are already combined by all the algorithms .    .",
    "there are @xmath132 users with each interferer having @xmath132db more power than the desired user .",
    "all the other parameters are the same as those for figure [ fig : sinr_vs_m_2].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , we consider a mai - limited scenario , where there are @xmath132 users with @xmath133 and @xmath134 @xmath135 , and all the parameters are as in the previous case .",
    "then , as shown in figure [ fig : sinr_vs_m_mailim ] , the improvement by using the suboptimal finger selection algorithms increase significantly .",
    "the main reason for this is that the suboptimal algorithms consider , although approximately , the correlation caused by mai whereas the conventional scheme simply ignores that .",
    "optimal and suboptimal finger selection algorithms for mmse - srake receivers in an ir - uwb system are considered .",
    "since uwb systems have large number of multipath components , only a subset of those components can be used due to complexity constraints .",
    "therefore , the selection of the optimal subset of multipath components is important for the performance of the receiver .",
    "we have shown that the optimal solution to this finger selection problem requires exhaustive search which becomes prohibitive for uwb systems .",
    "therefore , we have proposed approximate solutions of the problem based on the taylor series approximation and integer constraint relaxations . using two different integer relaxation approaches ,",
    "we have introduced two convex relaxations of the optimal finger selection algorithm . implementing these suboptimal algorithms on top of the conventional scheme",
    ", we can get close to the optimal solution , with much lower complexity .",
    "the two contributions of the paper are the formulation of the optimal problem and the convex relaxations . in the first ,",
    "the formulation is globally optimal but the solution methods for non - convex nonlinear integer constrained optimization must use heuristics to get to a locally optimal solution because otherwise computational load for global optimality is too much . in the second ,",
    "the formulation is relaxed , but the interior - point methods efficiently computes the globally optimal solution for these relaxations .",
