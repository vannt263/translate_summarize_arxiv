    "compactifications of type ii string theory with d  branes are very interesting from the point of view of string phenomenology and have been studied extensively in recent years .",
    "generically , the effective four dimensional theories obtained this way contain several massless scalars , the so - called moduli . in order to obtain a sensible theory",
    ", one would like to have a potential to fix their values .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing background fluxes , non  trivial values for the ns ",
    "ns and r  r field strength in the six  dimensional manifold used to compactify the theory ( for a recent review on type ii compactifications with and without fluxes see  @xcite ) . introducing general fluxes ,",
    "one leaves the realm of calabi  yau compactifications and deals with backgrounds with an @xmath1structure  @xcite .",
    "these geometries are a special case of @xmath0structures , introduced in  @xcite , and based on the notion of so  called generalised geometry , which goes back to hitchin  @xcite .",
    "possible applications in string theory are not limited to compactifications of type ii , but might also be relevant to compactifications of m  theory  @xcite .    introducing higher ",
    "dimensional objects , such as d  branes in type ii , in spaces of generalised geometry triggers new questions , in particular on the amount of preserved supersymmetry in the four  dimensional theory . in the classical case of @xmath2compactifications",
    ", this question can be answered by considering calibrations  @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , the concept of a calibration also makes sense in spaces with @xmath0structure  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this notion of a generalised calibration includes the classical case as a special one . in the context of d  branes in type ii string theory , such calibrated submanifolds have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "the topic is subject to active research and many aspects are still unexplored , in particular we miss explicit realisations of this concept in string theory .",
    "recent developments  @xcite include the investigation of the superpotential of compactified type ii theories on @xmath1spaces with d  branes and deformations of the calibrated cycles ( cf . also the contribution of l. martucci to these proceedings ) .",
    "this article is organised as follows .",
    "first we will explain the notion of spaces with @xmath0structure , paving the ground for our main topic , the notion of calibrated submanifolds on these spaces which we discuss in section  [ seccal ] .",
    "finally , an explicit example showing how to obtain the classical calibrations will be discussed in the case of an @xmath1structure .",
    "before defining @xmath0structures , let us briefly review the notion of a `` classical '' @xmath4structure and what we mean by topological and geometrical reductions . given a manifold @xmath5 of dimension @xmath6 and a vector bundle @xmath7 of rank @xmath8 over it , the transition functions generically take values in @xmath9 .",
    "a _ topological reduction _ or _",
    "@xmath4structure _ is defined by requiring the transition functions to take values in @xmath10 .",
    "objects @xmath11 , which are stabilised by the action of @xmath4 , i. e. they are invariant under @xmath4transformations , can therefore be globally defined on @xmath5 .",
    "the possible choices for embedding @xmath4 into @xmath9 are parametrised by @xmath12 .",
    "this also gives rise to topological obstruction against the existence of a @xmath4structure , namely we need to have at least one globally defined section of the associated bundle with fibre @xmath12 . in the following",
    "we will also speak of a _ reduction _ of the structure group @xmath9 to @xmath4 .",
    "a @xmath4structure on the tangent bundle @xmath13 is refered to as _ classical_.    as a simple example consider the case of a manifold of dimension @xmath6 with an @xmath14structure .",
    "the reduction of the structure group from @xmath15 to @xmath16 stabilises a symmetric two  tensor , which we identify as the riemannian metric @xmath17 .",
    "a further reduction from @xmath16 to @xmath14 is equivalent to the existence of a globally defined volume form , that is an orientation on @xmath5 .",
    "here we find a topological obstruction against the existence of an @xmath14structure , namely @xmath5 has to be orientable , which is equivalent to @xmath18 , the vanishing of the first stiefel  whitney class",
    ". on @xmath5 exists a prefered connection , the levi - cevita connection , which is compatible with the @xmath14structure , meaning @xmath19 .",
    "this links into the concept of a _",
    "geometrical reduction_. an arbitrary connection @xmath20 on @xmath13 can be locally written as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is usual differentiation on @xmath23 and @xmath24 a @xmath25form taking values in the lie algebra @xmath26 . a topological reduction to @xmath4",
    "is compatible with @xmath20 if the locally defined matrices actually take values in @xmath27 , the lie algebra of @xmath4 .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that the stabilised objects @xmath11 are covariantly constant , i.  e. @xmath28 , as it happens , for instance , for @xmath17 and the levi  civita connection in the case of an @xmath16structure .    on our way to @xmath0structures we will take two more intermediate steps .",
    "firstly , we consider so  called _ generalised structures _ , which are associated with a subgroup of @xmath29 .",
    "this is the structure group of the bundle @xmath30 , which naturally exists on any manifold @xmath5 .",
    "it is a rank @xmath31 vector bundle with a natural orientation and inner product of signature @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath29structure on @xmath33 is always spinnable , for @xmath34 ( using @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , hence we obtain a corresponding spin structure ( which is actually canonic ) .",
    "the corresponding spinors , sections of the spin bundles @xmath37 of @xmath38 , are almost isomorphic to even or odd forms on @xmath5 . almost , because it turns out that we have @xmath39 so in order to identify spinors with differential forms we have to choose a nowhere vanishing @xmath6vector on @xmath5 .",
    "the choices for this are parametrised by sections in @xmath40 , that is , by a scalar function @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "this scalar field can be identified with the well  known dilaton field in string theory .",
    "the clifford action of elements @xmath43 on spinors @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 for two spinors @xmath46 , we can define an invariant bilinear form ( an inner product ) as @xmath47^n,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the anti  automorphism of the clifford algebra that gives a plus sign for @xmath49forms with @xmath50 and a minus sign otherwise .    to finally define @xmath0structures , we look at specific subgroups of the generalised structure defined by @xmath51 , namely those which induce an additional metric @xmath17 ( besides the natural inner product that exists on @xmath33 ) and a two  form @xmath52 on @xmath13 .",
    "the pair @xmath53 is sometimes also called a generalised riemannian metric .",
    "the associated @xmath54flux of the generalised riemannian metric is then @xmath55 .",
    "one can also incorporate closed , but not globally exact @xmath54fluxes by using gerbes , but we will not need that here . the existence of the datum @xmath53 reduces the structure group to @xmath56 .",
    "generalised @xmath4structure _ is a further reduction of this group to @xmath57 .",
    "we can describe this reduction in terms of the stabilised objects we obtain . in our case each @xmath4 preserves , as a subgroup of @xmath58 , a chiral spinor @xmath59 , and the invariant @xmath38spinor is @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "to describe calibrated submanifolds on spaces with a generalised structure as introduced in the last section we have to extend our usual notion of a subspace . before doing so ,",
    "let us briefly recall the definition of calibrated subspaces in the classical case  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath61form @xmath62 on an oriented vector space @xmath63 is called a calibration , if @xmath64 for some @xmath61subplane @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the volume form induced by the riemannian metric on @xmath63 .",
    "the equality should hold for at least one subplane , which is said to be _ calibrated _ with respect to @xmath62 .    for generalised geometries , we have to consider not only a subspace @xmath65 , but rather a pair @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "later on , this @xmath69form will account for a possible abelian gauge field on the d  brane .",
    "we can associate a so  called _ pure _ spinor to the datum @xmath67 , namely the spinor annihilated by the isotropic subspace @xmath70 .",
    "purity refers to the fact that the annihilator is of maximal dimension , namely @xmath6 .",
    "this spinor is given , up to a multiple , by @xmath71 .",
    "normalising , we define @xmath72 in analogy to the classical case , we speak of a calibration form @xmath73 if @xmath74 for any @xmath75 and if the bound is met for at least one `` generalised '' subplane @xmath67 .",
    "the calibration condition can also be cast in a slightly more familiar form for physicists ( see prop .",
    "2.71 in  @xcite ) , namely @xmath76^k\\le\\sqrt{\\det\\left((g+b)|_u - f\\right)}\\vol_u.\\ ] ] everything we have done so far for vector spaces extends globally in an obvious way , for instance the calibration condition .",
    "describing d  branes in string compactifications requires the reduction of the structure group not only on the topological level , but also imposes some integrability condition in analogy to the geometrical reductions in the classical case . in particular , we want conditions for the branes to preserve some part of the original supersymmetry which is equivalent to demanding that the corresponding submanifolds are volume minimising within their homology class . in the presence of @xmath77fields or fluxes , the volume functional gets replaced by the born  infeld functional containing contributions from the additional datum .    as has been proven in  @xcite , every calibrated submanifold will minimise the functional @xmath78 if the calibration form is closed . to include the rr ",
    "potentials @xmath79 of type ii string theory into this setup amounts to considering an additional term in the functional and changing the integrability condition .    in the most general case we consider the integrability condition @xmath80 under which calibrated submanifolds minimise the functional , @xmath81",
    "to make contact with calibrated subspaces used in type ii string compactifications , let us check the general condition for the case of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "an @xmath1structure stabilises two @xmath84spinors @xmath85 , which can be decomposed into the tensor product of two chiral @xmath86 spinors @xmath87 as at the end of section  [ secgg ] . in the limiting case where the two spinors are equal",
    ", we obtain the well  known case of a classical @xmath2structure .",
    "we can calibrate with respect to @xmath88 or @xmath89 , where @xmath24 is the khler form and @xmath90 the holomorphic @xmath91form .",
    "for simplicity let @xmath92 .",
    "the two respective calibration conditions then describe precisely the holomorphic cycles of b  branes and the lagrangian cycles of a  branes . for non ",
    "zero @xmath77 , we obtain an additional solution which corresponds to coisotropic a  branes ( for a more detailed description of this and other examples , see  @xcite ) .    for a general @xmath1structure , submanifolds of any even or odd dimension ( depending on the choice of the calibration form ) can occur .",
    "in particular , we could obtain isotropic a ",
    "branes of dimension one .",
