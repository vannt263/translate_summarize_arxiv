    "beyond the discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite no signs of genuine new physics have shown up so far at high energies .",
    "however , the existence of new physics has been established with the discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite , implying the existence of lepton flavor violation and nonzero neutrino masses .",
    "unraveling the origin of the latter constitutes one of the main challenges of particle physics .",
    "while the prevailing view is that neutrino masses arise from physics associated with unification , they might as well signal novel tev - scale physics leading to potentially large charged lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) rates and possibly also new phenomena testable at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "in this case it could well be that new physics may actually show up mainly in the form of lepton flavor violation , boosting the motivation to search for charged lfv phenomena such as the rare decay @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the current limit @xmath2",
    "@xcite already puts severe constraints on models of new physics .",
    "models based on the @xmath0 gauge theory ( 3 - 3 - 1 ) constitute a minimal extension of the standard model ( sm ) that accounts for the existence of three families of fermions , the same as the number of colors  @xcite .",
    "they provide an economical scheme to generate tiny neutrino masses radiatively from tev scale physics  @xcite and could lead to successful gauge coupling unification through neutrino masses and tev scale physics  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they naturally solve the strong @xmath3 problem by including in an elegant way the peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the phenomenology of lepton flavor violation in the @xmath0 schemes . for definiteness",
    "we focus on the simplest implementation of the inverse seesaw mechanism within the 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "we show that it offers striking flavor correlations between rare charged lepton flavor violating decays and the measured neutrino oscillations parameters .",
    "such predictions result from the gauge theory structure itself without the need for imposing any specific flavor symmetry .",
    "we analyze the complementarity between charged lfv and neutrino oscillations , a feature which may render the 3 - 3 - 1 scenario strictly testable within the upcoming generation of lfv searches .",
    "we consider a variant of the model introduced in  @xcite in which neutrinos get masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism instead of quantum corrections . the model is based on the @xmath0 gauge symmetry , extended with a global @xmath4 so as to consistently define lepton number  .",
    "we also invoke an auxiliary parity symmetry in order to ensure a realistic quark mass spectrum .",
    "the model contains three generations of lepton triplets ( @xmath5 ) , two generations of quark triplets ( @xmath6 ) , one generation of quark anti - triplet ( @xmath7 ) , along , of course , with their iso - singlet right - handed partners , and accompanied by three generations of neutral fermion singlets ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the gauge symmetry breaking is implemented through three scalar anti - triplets ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the particle content of the model is summarized in  table  ( [ tab : content ] ) .",
    "the fundamental fermions interact through the exchange of @xmath10 gauge bosons : the @xmath11 gluons of @xmath12 , the @xmath11 `` weak '' @xmath13 bosons associated to @xmath14 ( @xmath15 of which form @xmath16 electrically charged bosons , and the rest are neutral ) , and the @xmath17 boson associated to @xmath18 .",
    "+ the lepton representations in table  ( [ tab : content ] ) can be decomposed as : @xmath19 where we identify @xmath20  @xcite .    in the scalar sector ,",
    "on the other hand , we have : @xmath21 after electroweak symmetry breaking , the electric charge and lepton number assignments of the particles of the model follow from the action of the operators : @xmath22    .particle content of the model . here",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the relevant terms in the lagrangian for leptons are : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are generic @xmath29 matrices , while @xmath30 is anti - symmetric and @xmath31 is the @xmath29 majorana mass term for the singlets @xmath8 ( symmetric , due to the pauli principle ) .",
    "the scalar potential of the model can be written as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are parameters with dimensions of mass .",
    "the two latter couplings break the @xmath36 softly . for simplicity",
    "we denote all the dimensionless couplings by @xmath37 and take @xmath38 .    in full generality ,",
    "the scalars of the model are allowed to take vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in the following directions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . however , in order to recover the sm as a low energy limit , we assume the hierarchy @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , we assume : @xmath43 , which together with the @xmath36 symmetry guarantees the existence of a simple pattern of realistic quark masses ( see below ) .",
    "we define the covariant derivative in the usual way as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the gauge boson , @xmath46 are the generators of the group and the sum extends over all gauge groups included in @xmath47 . assuming @xmath48 , and keeping only the leading order terms , one finds that the mass spectrum of the charged scalars is given as : @xmath49 on the other hand the masses of the neutral cp - even scalars are , up to corrections of @xmath50 : @xmath51 finally , the masses of the neutral cp - odd scalars at leading order are given as : @xmath52 the massless scalars found in the above equations correspond to the degrees of freedom ` eaten - up ' by the charged and neutral gauge bosons , respectively , which acquire the following masses : @xmath53    notice that since @xmath54 is singlet under the @xmath55 subgroup contained in @xmath14 , the vev @xmath56 will control the four new gauge bosons masses and break @xmath14 to @xmath55 . on the other hand , @xmath57 is broken at the electroweak scale by the @xmath58 and @xmath59 vevs down to the electromagnetic @xmath60 symmetry . for @xmath61",
    "all the scalars of the model are naturally heavy , except one state that we can identify with the sm higgs boson , @xmath62 , in good approximation . indeed ,",
    "its couplings to the fermions confirm that the state @xmath63 is the one that gives mass to sm fermions .",
    "we now turn to the quark sector . from the symmetries of the model , see table  ( [ tab : content ] ) , it follows that the quark lagrangian is given by : @xmath64 where we defined @xmath25 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this lagrangian leads to the following mass matrices : @xmath65 @xmath66 thanks to the @xmath36 symmetry , the sm and exotic sub - sectors are independent of each other and can be adjusted individually to easily obtain a realistic quark sector and heavy exotic quarks at the same time .",
    "the presence of the small term @xmath67 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : laglep ] ) , explicitly breaks @xmath68 and provides the seed for lepton number violation leading to neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism . indeed , after spontaneous symmetry breaking of the electroweak gauge group , we get the following @xmath69 neutrino mass matrix , in the basis ( @xmath70 )  @xcite : m = (    ccc 0 & m_d & 0 + & 0 & m + & & m_s    ) , where @xmath71 and @xmath72  ) does not depend on the conditions imposed on the vevs . indeed , even if @xmath73 the resulting linear seesaw term  @xcite would give only a subleading contribution @xmath74 .",
    "the inverse seesaw - induced light neutrino masses can be written as  @xcite : m_= m_d ( m^t ) ^-1 m_s m^-1 m_d^t . here , the matrix @xmath75 can be taken diagonal without loss of generality . using this freedom and taking into account that @xmath76 is anti - symmetric , eq .  ( [ eq : inv1 ] ) can be expressed in terms of an effective symmetric @xmath29 matrix , @xmath77 , as : m_= - m_d m^-1 m_s m^-1 m_d - m_d m^-1 m_d .",
    "a simple implication of the antisymmetry of the `` dirac '' entry @xmath76 is that @xmath78 , so that the lightest neutrino in this model must be massless at the tree level .",
    "let us now proceed to a simple parameter counting . on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inv1 ] ) one has @xmath79 independent complex parameters , since @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast , on the right - hand side of  eq .",
    "( [ eq : inv1 ] ) one has @xmath80 independent complex parameters : @xmath81 in @xmath76 , and @xmath82 elements in @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath15 ( complex ) relations among the parameters ( @xmath84 , and @xmath31 ) .",
    "one can choose as free parameters the @xmath81 off - diagonal entries of @xmath85 , together with a global scaling factor @xmath86 defined through : m_d^ij = m^-1 ( m_^1j m_^2i - m_^1i m_^2j ) . from  eq .",
    "( [ eq : inv1 ] ) , we can see that @xmath87 scales as @xmath88 , so that for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and neutrino masses of @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 .",
    "in contrast , the diagonal entries of @xmath93 are functions of its off - diagonal elements and @xmath76 .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq : md ] ) is not an _ ansatz _ , but the most general solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inv2 ] ) .",
    "such a parameterization makes explicit the direct relation between charged lfv observables and neutrino oscillation parameters , which is a characteristic feature of our model .",
    "indeed , lfv in this model arises from the term : @xmath94 which depends solely upon the coupling @xmath30 , hence @xmath76 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq : md ] ) together with @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the leptonic mixing matrix in its standard parameterization in terms of three mixing angles and the dirac phase ( @xmath97 ) , one obtains the relevant coupling for lfv as : y^a & = & (    ccc 0 & y^a_12 & y^a_13 + - y^a_12 & 0 & y^a_23 + - y^a_13 & - y^a_23 & 0    ) + & & + & & \\ {    c +   +    . , for normal ( nh ) and inverse hierarchies ( ih ) . here the parameters @xmath98 are functions of the lepton mixing matrix parameters , i.e. @xmath99 , and are given in the appendix .",
    "it is remarkable that the yukawas @xmath30 relevant for determination of lfv rates are , up to a global scaling factor , fully determined by the parameters measured in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "this allows us to make definite predictions for lfv observables that can be used to provide an unambiguous test of the model , as we show below .     versus @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "we take @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the vertical band is the @xmath106 range reported in  @xcite .",
    "the other mixing angles are taken within their @xmath107 range  @xcite .",
    "we also show in the lower - right corner the @xmath108 branching ratio as a function of @xmath75 , using best - fit values for the mixing angles , as given in @xcite . ]      in order to show the predictive power of the model here we focus , for definiteness , on flavour - changing leptonic ( radiative ) decays .",
    "this probe constitutes one of the most important tests of new physics and has been actively sought after in many experiments .",
    "the branching ratio ( br ) of the decay of the charged lepton @xmath110 is given as : ( _ i _ j ) = , where @xmath111 is the total decay width of @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is a function that depends on the masses and mixings of all the particles running inside the loop ( summation over the different contributions is implicit here ) .",
    "we have three different classes of contributions : @xmath114 ) loops mediated by the new heavy gauge bosons .",
    "these are suppressed due to the large scale of the breaking of @xmath14 compared to @xmath115 ; @xmath116 ) contributions from the exchange of a charged scalar whose mass is @xmath117 ; and finally @xmath118 ) the `` standard '' loop , mediated by the sm @xmath119 boson and neutrinos .",
    "the latter two contributions dominate the @xmath109 amplitude , with relative sizes depending on the ratio @xmath120 . + this branching ratio depends on the neutrino mixing parameters , the global scaling factor @xmath87 , and on the neutrino mass hierarchy . as can be seen in  eq .",
    "( [ eq : ya ] ) , the off - diagonal entries in @xmath30 are larger in the case of ih by a factor @xmath121 with respect to nh so that , for the same input parameters , one has larger lfv effects in ih .",
    "+    we compute the various relevant lfv observables using flavorkit  @xcite  .",
    "the branching ratio of the decay @xmath108 is shown in figure  ( [ fig : muvs13 ] ) as a function of @xmath122 for two different values of the ( quasi - dirac  @xcite ) right - handed neutrino mass @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the vertical band is the @xmath106 range reported in  @xcite , whereas the other mixing angles are randomly taken within their @xmath107 range  @xcite .",
    "this figure has been obtained by varying @xmath75 ( by taking different values for the @xmath28 yukawa couplings ) for the fixed parameters @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath103 .",
    "we also consider degenerate right - handed neutrinos , normal hierarchy for the light neutrinos and a vanishing dirac cp violating phase .",
    "one notices that the branching ratio is lower for the @xmath101 case .",
    "this is caused by a partial cancellation between the standard loop , mediated by the @xmath119 boson , and the contribution induced by the exchange of charged scalars .",
    "this cancellation takes place for @xmath125 and is explicitly illustrated in the lower - right corner of figure  ( [ fig : muvs13 ] ) , where the @xmath108 branching ratio is shown as a function of @xmath75 , using best - fit values for the mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "the main message from figure  ( [ fig : muvs13 ] ) is that @xmath108 may take place with sizeable rates , close to the current limit , or even larger . given the expected sensitivities of upcoming experiments one finds that the detection of this and other muon number violating processes might become feasible .",
    "and @xmath126 decays to @xmath127 , @xmath128 versus @xmath129 .",
    "the vertical band is the @xmath106 range given in  @xcite .",
    "the tilted band is obtained by varying the other mixing angles within their @xmath130 range  @xcite . ]",
    "since the br depends on a global multiplicative factor , it is interesting to consider the ratio of branching ratios of lfv lepton decays .",
    "it follows from  eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfv ] ) that : = . for the simplest case of nearly degenerate right - handed neutrinos , the @xmath113 functions are all equal and cancel out in the fraction . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiobrs ] ) depends exclusively on the ratios of @xmath131 , only on the neutrino mixing angles .",
    "the main advantage of considering the ratio of branching ratios and a quasi degenerate spectrum is that this leads to clean predictions which do not depend on the neutrino mass hierarchy nor the loop functions .",
    "indeed , in this simplified scenario , by combining  eq .",
    "( [ eq : ya ] ) with  eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiobrs ] ) we obtain the following predictions : @xmath132 where we have used the best - fit values for the neutrino parameters as derived in the global fit of neutrino oscillations given in  @xcite and set @xmath133 .",
    "so , when the right - handed neutrino spectrum is degenerate , the model predicts @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , given the expected sensitivities for @xmath126 lfv decays   radiative decays are around @xmath135  @xcite , whereas the current meg bound on @xmath136 is many orders of magnitude stronger , @xmath137 .",
    "] , the simple observation of @xmath138 in one ( or several ) of the near future experiments would rule out our simplest degenerate right - handed neutrino hypothesis .",
    "the viable alternative scenario in such cases would be a hierarchical right - handed neutrinos spectrum , impliying a non - vanishing contribution of the @xmath113 loop functions in the ratio of brs . in this case",
    "the @xmath113 functions for different flavor transitions can take very different values , and thus the ratios in eq .   can clearly depart from their predictions in the degenerate scenario .",
    "+ as an illustration , in figure  ( [ fig : rbrvs12 ] ) we show the ratio of the br of @xmath126 and @xmath139 decays to @xmath127 , namely @xmath140 as a function of the solar mixing parameter @xmath141 .",
    "the other oscillation parameters are varied randomly within their @xmath130 ranges  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the ratio of the br of leptonic @xmath126 decays , @xmath142 depends mainly on the solar mixing parameter . + for other lfv processes such as @xmath143 and @xmath144 conversion in nuclei , our results are qualitatively similar to the ones found in standard low - scale seesaw models  @xcite .",
    "loops including neutrinos give the most important contributions , leading to lfv rates comparable to the ones for the radiative decay @xmath109 .",
    "this will be of special relevance due to the expected sensitivities in the coming experiments  @xcite .",
    "the complete study of all lfv processes is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in summary , we have shown how a simple extended @xmath0 electroweak gauge symmetry implementing the inverse seesaw mechanism implies striking flavor correlations between rare charged lepton flavor violating decays and the measured neutrino oscillations parameters .",
    "the predictions follow simply from the enlarged gauge structure without any imposed flavor symmetry .",
    "such tight complementarity between charged lfv and neutrino oscillations renders the scenario strictly testable .",
    "a more detailed study of other lfv processes will be taken up elsewhere .",
    "the scheme also has a non - trivial structure in the quarks sector since , thanks to the anomaly cancelation requirements , the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism breaks down , leading to a plethora of flavor - changing neutral currents in the quark sector  @xcite .",
