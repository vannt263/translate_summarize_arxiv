    "repetitive control ( rc , or repetitive controller , also designated rc ) is a control method used specifically in tracking or rejecting periodic signals . in the past two decades",
    ", rc for linear time - invariant ( lti ) systems has reached maturity .",
    "there has been little research , however , on rc for nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "this is the initial motivation of this paper .",
    "one of the major drawbacks of rc is that the control accuracy is sensitive to period variation of the external signals .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that , with a period variation as small as @xmath0 for an lti system , the gain of the internal model part of the rc drops from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . as a result",
    ", the tracking accuracy may be far from satisfactory , especially for high - precision control .",
    "for such a purpose , higher - order rcs composed of several delay blocks in series were proposed to improve the robustness of the control accuracy against period variation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , these methods can not be applied to nonlinear systems directly as they are all based on transfer functions and frequency - domain analysis .",
    "this is the second motivation of this paper . although controllers are often implemented by digital processors nowadays , it is rare to see a discrete - time rc design for a continuous nonlinear system . unlike lti systems , nonlinear systems can not be represented as explicit , exact discrete - time models .",
    "only approximate controller design methods can be applied by taking the discretization error as an external disturbance .",
    "this often requires the resulting closed - loop system to be input - to - state stable ( iss , or input - to - state stability , also designated iss ) with respect to the discretization error @xcite .",
    "however , a linear rc system is a neutral type system in a critical case @xcite .",
    "the characteristic equation of the neutral type system has an infinite sequence of roots with negative real parts approaching zero .",
    "consequently , the iss property can not be obtained .",
    "therefore , in theory , a discrete - time rc can not be obtained by discretizing a continuous rc directly for nonlinear systems .",
    "this is the third motivation .",
    "in fact , the discretization of systems in turn brings in uncertainties in the period .",
    "since the number of delay blocks is an integer , @xmath3 has to be rounded to the nearest integer @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the period of the reference signal and @xmath6 is the sample time .",
    "so , we in fact take @xmath7 as the known period rather than @xmath8 this period variation is caused by discretization .",
    "based on the discussion above , a discrete - time robust rc problem for nonlinear systems is both challenging and practical . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on a discrete - time _ output - feedback _ robust rc problem  for  a class of systems with measurable nonlinearities .",
    "for this problem , we design a discrete - time output - feedback robust rc under a new tracking framework , named the _ additive - state - decomposition - based tracking control framework _ @xcite . the key idea is to decompose the output - feedback rc problem into two _ _ well - solved _ _ control _ _ problems by additive state decomposition for example , it is decomposed into two subsystems : @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11and@xmath12 respectively .",
    "the lower - order subsystem decomposition satisfies @xmath13 and @xmath14 by contrast , the proposed additive state decomposition satisfies @xmath15 and@xmath16 : an output - feedback rc for an lti system and a state feedback stabilized control for a nonlinear system . since the rc problem is only limited to an lti system , existing robust higher - order rc methods can be applied directly . moreover , according to the properties of the two control problems , we can adopt two different ways to design discrete - time controllers , i.e. , discrete - time model design for the lti component and emulation design for the nonlinear component @xcite .",
    "finally , one can combine the discrete - time output - feedback robust rc with the discrete - time state - feedback stabilized controller to achieve the original control goal .",
    "this paper is an extension of our previous paper @xcite and focuses on the rc problem . here",
    "we propose for a class of nonlinear systems a detailed rc design .",
    "the contributions of this paper are : i ) the discrete - time rc problem is solved for a class of nonlinear systems _ for the first time _",
    "( covering the discrete - time output - feedback robust rc problem for a class of continuous - time nonlinear systems ) ; ii ) more importantly , a bridge is built between existing rc design methods for lti systems and a class of nonlinear systems so that more rc problems for nonlinear systems become tractable .",
    "we use the following notation .",
    "@xmath17 is euclidean space of dimension @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the euclidean vector norm or induced matrix norm .",
    "the symbol @xmath20 implies that @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote laplace transform and inverse laplace transform , respectively . @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote z - transform and inverse z - transform , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 denotes nonnegative integers .",
    "the following definitions can also be found in @xcite .",

    "it is assumed that only @xmath55 is available from measurements . in this paper , we consider the continuous - time system ( [ equ0 ] ) by using a discrete - time controller with a sampling period @xmath56 where @xmath57 @xmath58 more precisely , @xmath59 in ( [ equ0 ] ) is constant during a sampling interval , so that @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 . in practice",

    "* * remark 2**__. _ _ the nonlinear function vector @xmath75can be arbitrary . here",
    ", we do not specify its form .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear system ( [ equ0 ] ) is allowed to be a non - minimum phase _ _  _ _ system @xcite .    before proceeding further ,",
    "the following preliminary result on iss * * is required .    *",
    "definition 1 * @xcite .",
    "the system @xmath76 is iss with respect to @xmath77  if there exist @xmath78and@xmath79 such that the solutions of the system satisfy @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 , @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "suppose that the feedback is implemented by a sampler and zero - order hold as@xmath87 then , we have    * theorem 1 * @xcite . if the continuous - time system ( [ iss_sys ] ) is iss , then there exist @xmath78and  @xmath88 such that given any triple of strictly positive numbers @xmath89 there exists @xmath90 such that for all @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 the solutions of the sampled - data system @xmath94 satisfy:@xmath95    * * remark 3**__. theorem 1 _ _ states that if the continuous - time closed - loop system is iss , then the sampled - data system with the emulated controller will be semiglobally practically iss with a sufficiently small @xmath6 .",
    "in order to make the paper self - contained , the additive state decomposition of ( [ equ0 ] ) in @xcite is recalled here briefly . consider the system ( [ equ0 ] ) as the original system .",
    "we choose the primary system as follows:@xmath96 then the secondary system is determined by the original system ( [ equ0 ] ) and the primary system ( [ equ1_pri ] ) as@xmath97 where @xmath98 according to the additive state decomposition , we have@xmath99 the secondary system ( [ equ1_sec ] ) is further written as@xmath100 where @xmath101 if @xmath102 then @xmath103 is an equilibrium point of ( [ equ1_sec1 ] ) .",
    "controller design for the decomposed systems ( [ equ1_pri ] ) and ( [ equ1_sec ] ) will use their outputs or states as feedback .",
    "however , they are unknown .",
    "for such a purpose , an observer is proposed to estimate @xmath104 and @xmath105    * * theorem 2 * * @xcite . _ _ suppose that an observer is designed to estimate @xmath104 and @xmath106 in ( [ equ1_pri])-([equ1_sec ] ) as follows:@xmath107 then @xmath108 and @xmath109    * remark 4*. additive state decomposition brings in two benefits .",
    "first , since output of the primary system and state of the secondary system can be observed , the original tracking problem for the system ( [ equ0 ] ) is correspondingly decomposed into two problems : an _ output - feedback _ tracking problem for an lti ` primary ' system ( @xmath110 ) and a _ state - feedback _ stabilization problem for the complementary ` secondary ' system ( @xmath111 ) . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath112 according to ( [ equ1_relation ] ) .",
    "since the tracking task is only assigned to the lti system , it is therefore much easier than that for the nonlinear system ( [ equ0 ] ) .",
    "the state - feedback stabilization is also easier than the output - feedback stabilization as the non - minimum phase problem is avoided .",
    "secondly , for the two decomposed components , different discrete - time controller design methods can be employed ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) because for lti systems an explicit , exact discrete - time model can be obtained whereas for nonlinear systems it can not .",
    "the iss property can not be obtained for a traditional rc system .",
    "this implies that a sufficiently small uncertainty may cause instability .",
    "so , it is appropriate to follow the discrete - time model design for the discrete - time rc design of the linear primary system . on the other hand ,",
    "a state - feedback stabilization problem for the secondary system is independent of the internal model of rcs .",
    "the resultant closed - loop system can be rendered iss .",
    "so , we can adopt the emulation design for the discrete - time controller design of the nonlinear secondary system .",
    "so far , we have decomposed the system into two systems each with its own task . in this section ,",
