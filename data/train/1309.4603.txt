    "finally , the most crucial difference between a magnetic behavior of both considered spin - chain models can be detected for @xmath124 . in this parameter space , the respective ground state of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg tetrahedral chain is formed by the haldane - like ( hd ) state with the energy gap @xmath125 unlike the other gapped sd and sa ground states of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain .",
    "consequently , the magnetization of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg tetrahedral chain remains zero until the magnetic field closes the haldane gap and then it continuously rises with the external field until the saturation magnetization is reached ( see fig . [ fig8](d ) ) .",
    "in summary , we have provided a detailed study of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain , which has been exactly solved by taking advantage of local conservation for the total spin on the heisenberg bonds and transfer - matrix technique . in particular , we have examined the ground state , magnetization process , quantum entanglement , magnetocaloric effect and overall thermodynamics of this exactly solvable spin - chain model .",
    "exact results for the ground state and zero - temperature magnetization curves of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain have been also confronted with the corresponding results of the analogous but fully quantum spin-@xmath0 heisenberg tetrahedral chain obtained within the framework of dmrg calculations .",
    "the most interesting finding stemming from the present study can be viewed in providing correlation between the magnetic behavior and thermal entanglement of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the magnetization plateaux observable at sufficiently low temperatures manifest themselves in respective plateaux of the concurrence , which has been exploited for measuring the bipartite entanglement between two spins coupled by the heisenberg interaction .",
    "the exactly solved ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain thus verifies the well - known dictum that the ground - state concurrence and other entanglement witnesses undergo a discontinuous change across the first - order quantum phase transition driven by the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in addition , the abrupt temperature - induced changes of the concurrence in a close vicinity of the critical fields afford a clear signature of first - order quantum phase transtions at finite temperatures .",
    "the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain exhibits a lot of other interesting features including the enhanced magnetocaloric effect or double - peak specific heat curves .",
    "it should be stressed , moreover , that the exact results for thermodynamic quantities of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain might also be useful for a better understanding of the magnetic behavior of the quantum spin-@xmath0 heisenberg tetrahedral chain at finite temperatures on assumption that the intra - rung coupling is at least twice as large as the inter - rung coupling .",
