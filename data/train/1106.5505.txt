    "the most extreme blazars achieve energies of up to 10 tev , giving rise to the class of high - energy peaked bl lac objects ( hbl ) while the somewhat less efficient accelerators in intermediate - energy peaked bl lac objects ( ibl ) are , in some cases , also able to reach energies beyond 100 gev .",
    "the emission mechanism is thought to be inverse compton scattering of ultra - relativistic electrons in the jet giving rise to power - law energy spectra that increase as a function of energy and peak at the maximum energy that the accelerating process of the radiating relativistic electrons is able to deliver .",
    "the universe is not transparent to very - high energy gamma - ray radiation ( vhegr ; @xmath11 ) , i.e. , a beam of these energetic photons will necessarily produce electron and positron pairs off of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , with typical mean free paths of vhegrs ranging from 30  mpc to 1  gpc depending upon gamma - ray energy and source redshift .",
    "the pairs produced by vhegr radiation have typical lorentz factors of @xmath12 .",
    "there are only two possible ultimate destinations for the kinetic energy of the pairs : _ the energy can either be channeled into lower energy ( gev ) gamma - ray radiation ( to which the universe is transparent ) , or heat the ambient medium with a partitioning factor that depends on the relative rates of the processes .",
    "_ the first process has generally been assumed to dominate the manner in which these pairs lose energy , almost exclusively through inverse compton scattering the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and ebl on a typical mean free path of @xmath13 today . when the up - scattered gamma - ray is itself a vhegr the process repeats , creating a second generation of pairs and up - scattering additional photons .",
    "the result is an inverse compton cascade depositing the energy of the original vhegr in gamma rays with energies @xmath14 .",
    "there are , however , problems with this picture .",
    "first , the expected inverse compton bump has not been seen in the spectra of luminous blazars around @xmath15 .",
    "this could imply the existence of intergalactic magnetic fields that deflect the pairs out of our line - of - sight , hence reducing the inverse compton emission @xcite .",
    "typical lower limits for magnetic fields would then range from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , depending on the assumed duty cycle of blazars and are dominated by void regions , which dominate a typical line - of - sight .",
    "the values at the upper end are of astrophysical interest in the context of the formation of galactic fields . ] .",
    "second , the spectral shape of the unresolved extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egrb ) , that has been measured by , exhibits a steep power - law at energies below @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "if blazars contribute substantially to the egrb , we would expect to see a flattening toward high energies , due to the inverse compton cascades , in conflict with the egrb .",
    "traditionally , the egrb is then used to constrain the evolution of the luminosity density of vhegr sources ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , it has been found that these can not have exhibited the dramatic rise in numbers by @xmath3@xmath19 seen in the quasar distribution .",
    "that is , the co - moving number of blazars must have remained essentially fixed , at odds with both the large - scale mass assembly history of the universe , e.g. , star formation history , and with the luminosity history of similarly accreting systems , e.g. , the quasar luminosity density .    in our first companion paper of this series (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we argued that instead of initiating an inverse compton cascade , the pairs dissipate their kinetic energy locally , heating the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "we identified a process that operates on a timescale fast in comparison to inverse compton cooling , dominating the latter for luminous tev blazars , i.e. , for hbl and ibl blazars with an equivalent isotropic luminosity of @xmath20 above @xmath18 . despite its dilute nature",
    ", the vhegr - generated beam of ultra - relativistic pairs , propagating through the igm , is susceptible to plasma beam instabilities .",
    "while the commonly discussed weibel and two - stream instabilities are strongly suppressed by finite beam temperatures , these are special cases of a general filamentary `` oblique '' instability which is far more virulent , and strongly insensitive to finite temperature effects @xcite .",
    "if these instabilities saturate at a rate that is comparable to their linear growth rate , the beam kinetic energy is directly transferred to electrostatic modes which rapidly dissipate locally , heating the igm .",
    "if this scenario or an analogous , similarly efficient mechanism operates in practice , it necessarily suppresses the inverse compton cascades and naturally explains the absence of an inverse compton bump in the tev blazar spectra without invoking an intergalactic magnetic field . at the same time , it allows for a redshift evolution of tev blazars that is identical to that of quasars without overproducing the egrb .",
    "in fact , for plausible parameters of tev blazar spectra , it is possible to explain the high - energy part of the egrb ( paper i ) without the need to appeal to exotic phenomena ( e.g. , dark matter annihilation , * ? ? ? * ) .    by dissipating the pairs energy into the igm , plasma instabilities ( or similar processes )",

    "mean free path of all known tev blazars yields a luminosity density , or equivalently a local heating rate , that dominates that of photoheating by more than an order of magnitude at the present epoch , after accounting for incompleteness corrections ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) . we have demonstrated that the local tev blazar luminosity function is consistent with a scaled version of the quasar luminosity function @xcite ,",
    "thus the conservative assumption is that they evolve similarly , presumably due to the same underlying accretion physics . with this assumption , we showed in paper ii that for the redshifts at which blazar heating is likely to be important , @xmath21 , the heating rate will be relatively uniform throughout space . between @xmath22 and 6",
    "it may experience order 50% fluctuations , and by @xmath23 , it will exhibit significant stochasticity with order unity deviations .",
    "this heating differs from other feedback prescriptions in an important way : since the number density of ebl photons and that of tev blazars are nearly homogeneously distributed on cosmological scales , so is the resulting pair density .",
    "hence , the implied heating rate is also homogeneous , i.e. , the volumetric blazar heating rate is uniform and independent of igm density and @xmath24 with an equivalent isotropic luminosity of @xmath25 ( see paper ii for details ) . ] . due to the large mean free path of tev - photons , which is much larger than the turn - around radius of any virialized structures ,",
    "the heating process is not expected to be dominated by contributions in highly biased regions at late times for @xmath26 .",
    "( at early times , when blazar heating exhibits considerable fluctuations , clustering bias could substantially modify the phenomenology of the heating mechanism . )",
    "the effect of a uniform heating rate is that the energy deposited per baryon is substantially larger in more tenuous regions of the universe . as a result ,",
    "underdense regions experience a larger temperature increase , producing an inverted temperature - density relation in voids , asymptotically approaching @xmath27 .",
    "generally , we found in paper ii that without any fine tuning it is possible to reproduce the inverted temperature - density relation at @xmath28 inferred by high - redshift studies @xcite , while simultaneously satisfying the temperature constraints at @xmath29 ( e.g. , those by * ? ? ? * ) and leaving the local forest unaffected .    in a follow - up paper by @xcite",
    ", we used hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological structure formation to explicitly demonstrate that blazar heating provides not only an excellent description of the one- and two - point statistics of high - redshift forest spectra but also the line width and column density distribution .",
    "this detailed agreement includes reproducing the observed mean transmission , and is achieved using the most recent estimate of the evolution of the photoionizing background without any tuning .",
    "these successes are due specifically to the salient properties of blazar heating , in particular its excess energy injection into the low density igm and its continuous nature .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the impact of such an important heating mechanism on cosmological structure formation .",
    "while we propose a well - motivated , physical heating mechanism that uses a certain type of plasma instability , our conclusions concerning the thermal history of the igm , the forest , as well as structure formation remain robust in that they only rely on a mechanism that dissipates the energy of tev blazars independently of the density and employs a redshift evolution similar to that of the quasar luminosity function . to study the impact on structure formation",
    ", we turn to the evolution of the entropy because in the absence of radiative cooling , entropy is conserved upon adiabatic compression and can only be increased through dissipation of gravitational energy in structure formation shocks or heating due to photo - ionization .",
    "hence , entropy is a unique thermodynamic variable with which to learn about the impact of non - gravitational feedback processes .",
    "we identify two different classes of objects where the time variable minimum entropy , or entropy floor , of the igm induced by blazar heating might dramatically change our present picture of structure formation : the structure of galaxy groups and clusters , and the formation of dwarf galaxies . before addressing the consequences of blazar heating for each",

    "more importantly , runaway cooling generally precludes the existence of the observed hot groups , making it clear that it can not be the sole explanation of the low x - ray luminosity of groups .",
    "however , radiative cooling is a physical process that will occur if it is not perfectly balanced by some heating process and the observations of multiphase gas in cool cores ( ccs ) suggest that cooling is happening @xcite , presumably through thermal instability @xcite . hence , while _ some _ of the elevated entropies in groups have to be attributed to cooling , the absence of a cooling catastrophe implies a ( non - gravitational ) energy feedback process that will inevitably also raise the core entropy .",
    "in contrast , preheating has met with broad success in explaining the observed @xmath35 correlation , ostensibly by suppressing the formation of dense cluster cores at low masses and therefore reducing @xmath30 for group - sized objects .",
    "typically , the redshift range adopted for the injection of the entropy , @xmath36 , ensures that preheating is complete well before any galaxy group or cluster has turned around from the hubble expansion and started to collapse .",
    "hence the entropy , @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the electron density and @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant ) , is generally injected at the lowest possible gas density ( and thus temperature ) at that redshift .",
    "this minimizes the heating necessary to produce the observed impact upon the entropy , typically @xmath40 per particle .",
    "numerical simulations incorporating a minimum entropy of the gas , or entropy floor , of @xmath41@xmath42 at redshifts around @xmath43@xmath44 , are able to steepen the @xmath45 relation from the purely gravitational collapse estimate ( @xmath46 ) , and find broad agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are serious observational difficulties confronting the standard preheating scenarios , apart from the theoretical problem of lacking a physical model for the heating process .",
    "first , after preheating , star formation in @xmath47 and lower mass galaxies is significantly suppressed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence inconsistent with observational data that finds , e.g. , the peak of the star formation rate at redshifts @xmath48 .",
    "second , the presence of a high entropy floor everywhere in the universe makes it impossible for groups to radiate away the excess entropy and impossible to explain the existence of a subset of x - ray luminous , cc groups with steep entropy profiles , and low values of the central entropy @xcite .",
    "heating via feedback processes , e.g. , from star formation ( stellar winds and supernova ) and agns ( for a review , see @xcite ) , has already been shown to have a large impact on the formation and history of galaxy clusters and groups . self - regulated , inhomogeneous energy feedback mechanisms are very successful in globally stabilizing the group and cluster atmospheres , and in particular , preventing the cooling catastrophe .",
    "the resulting gas mass profiles , gas fractions , and the @xmath35 correlation compare impressively to those observed @xcite .",
    "while there seems to be a globally convergent scenario emerging with convincing energetics and duty cycles , the actual heating process has yet to be identified and may involve interesting astrophysics , e.g. , turbulence @xcite , cosmic rays @xcite , or plasma instabilities @xcite .    as we will show in this paper ,",
    "the entropy injection by blazars is in some sense an amalgam of both the preheating and feedback mechanisms . unlike typical agn feedback ,",
    "the effect of the blazar heating is not localized , operating at much larger distances typically and thus over considerably longer timescales . unlike instantaneous preheating",
    ", the blazars provide a _ time - dependent _ entropy injection rate , peaking near @xmath3 . as a consequence",
    ", we will show that the formation of @xmath47 galaxies is not suppressed and early - forming groups are little affected by blazar heating , having had time to cool and develop an x - ray luminous _ cc _ ; avoiding the primary difficulties with the standard preheating scenario . on the other hand , the blazar - heated icm ending up in late - forming groups will not have had sufficient time to radiate the additional entropy away before it can be gravitationally reprocessed in merging shocks which are ubiquitous in a hierarchically growing universe .",
    "we will argue that this can lead to elevated entropy core values resembling those of _",
    "non - cool core ( ncc ) clusters_.      the @xmath49 cold dark matter ( @xmath49cdm ) concordance cosmology predicts that milky way - sized halos should contain many more dwarf - sized halos than the observed number of dwarf galaxies , the so - called `` substructure problem '' , or within the local context the `` missing satellites problem '' ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "closely related to this problem is the `` void phenomenon '' which is the apparent discrepancy between the number of dwarfs in low - density regions in simulations and the paucity of those in observations @xcite . in principle , both problems can be solved in three general ways : by suppressing the formation of dwarf halos , suppressing the formation of galaxies within existing dwarf halos , and/or suppressing star formation within dwarf galaxies . in the case of the `` void phenomenon '' , there is a forth class of models that solves the problem .",
    "considering interacting dark matter and dark energy as mediated , e.g. , by a yukawa coupling , implies a fifth force that reduces late accretion onto halos and pushes matter out of voids , hence resolving the discrepancy of dwarf abundances in voids @xcite . in the following , we review the three classes of models that are able to solve both problems simultaneously .",
    "suppressing the formation of dwarf halos is difficult to accomplish within the context of @xmath49cdm , requiring modifications to the standard cosmological paradigm , such as interacting dark matter @xcite , modifications to the seed perturbation spectrum @xcite , or warm dark matter ( wdm * ? ? ?",

    "may be accomplished in principle by a variety of mechanisms , including photoionization heating @xcite or accretion shock heating @xcite .",
    "if baryons can collect , they may not be able to cool efficiently due to a lack of h i as a result of photoionization @xcite or intrinsically low metallicities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent numerical simulations which self - consistently include the photoionizing background due to star formation have found that while it does have a pronounced effect , it can not suppress dwarf galaxy formation at the level implied by observations @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the metallicity distribution of some dwarfs is inconsistent with dwarfs generally being pre - reionization relics @xcite , and therefore the suppression of dwarf formation must have occurred more recently than the epoch of reionization .    once formed , the gas may be removed from dwarf galaxies via photo - evaporation @xcite and feedback from the first supernovae @xcite .",
    "tidal interactions of satellite dwarf halos with the milky way may result in a dramatic decrease in their mass , and to a lesser extent in circular velocity , after @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , these processes also strip material from larger halos , with the result that the smallest dwarf spheroidal galaxies presently within the local group may have had a mass at formation that was much larger than currently observed , and thus were capable of building up a sizeable stellar component in their seemingly shallow potential wells .",
    "as we will show in this work , the heating due to blazars provides an additional mechanism to suppress the formation of dwarfs . unlike photoionization models , which typically invoke the heating at reionization , blazar heating provides a well defined , time - dependent suppression mechanism , with the suppression rising dramatically after @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , due to its insensitivity to density , the heating from blazars suppresses structure formation most efficiently in the low - density regions that are responsible for late - forming dwarf halos . as a result",
    ", the impact from blazars is not degenerate with variations in the parameters of reionization and/or tidal interactions .",
    "this is the third in a series of three papers that discuss the potential cosmological impact of tev emission from blazars .",
    "paper i provides a plausible mechanism for the local dissipation of the tev luminosity , effectively producing an additional heating process within the igm , and its implications upon high - energy gamma - ray observations .",
    "paper ii estimates the magnitude of the new heating term , describes the associated modifications to the thermal history of the igm , and shows how this can explain some recent observations of the forest .",
    "paper iii , this paper , considers the impact the new heating term will have upon the structure and statistics of galaxy clusters and groups , and upon the ages and properties of dwarf galaxies throughout the universe , generally finding that blazar heating can help explain outstanding questions in both cases .    in section  [ sec : entropy ]",
    ", we show that blazar heating necessarily implies the injection of a tremendous amount of entropy and employ the implication for the evolution of the warm and hot phases of the igm .",
    "in particular , we show the broad implications of this heating on the x - ray population of clusters ( section  [ sec : x - ray ] ) , the entropy structure of galaxy groups / clusters ( section  [ sec : groups ] ) , the cc / ncc cluster bimodality ( section  [ sec : bimod ] ) , and its impact on the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) power - spectrum ( section  [ sec : sz ] ) .",
    "we discuss the impact of this heating on the formation of structure in the universe in section  [ sec : structure formation ] , showing from the viewpoint of linear theory that the formation of dwarf galaxies that end up in milky way - sized halos ( section  [ sec : mwms ] ) as well as those in voids ( section  [ sec : vd ] ) are suppressed at late redshift ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the calculations presented below assume the wmap7 cosmology @xcite with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and a matter transfer function that accounts for the baryonic features @xcite .",
    "the injection of large amounts of energy into the igm by blazars is accompanied by a substantial increase in the igm entropy . here , we discuss the impact of this additional entropy upon the evolution of the gravitationally heated warm and hot components of the igm . in doing",
    "so we neglect radiative cooling , an approximation that is well justified in the low - density regions of the igm generally and one that we will justify for late - forming groups and clusters below . in this case",
    "the entropy of the igm necessarily increases during gravitational collapse ( e.g. , due to structure - formation shocks , feedback , and/or photoheating ) . as a consequence",
    ", the entropy injected by tev blazars places an elevated floor upon the entropy of late - forming structures within the igm .",
    "if radiative cooling is permitted ( e.g. , at the centers of early - forming clusters ) , the gas entropy may decrease , reducing the impact of the blazar heating . in this work , we will encounter two different definitions of entropy , where @xmath57 is a constant that depends upon fundamental constants and a mixture of particle masses . ] which are proportional to each other , namely , @xmath58 @xmath59 is a quantity conveniently used in the x - ray literature as it can be directly constructed from the observables temperature , @xmath31 , and electron density , @xmath38 .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 is the constant of proportionality in the equation of state @xmath61 for an adiabatic monatomic gas with mass density @xmath62 and pressure @xmath63 .",
    "the evolution of the temperature and the entropy are shown in figure [ f : thermal history ] for a fluid element at overdensity @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the average and local matter density ) for the cases of pure photoheating and two realizations of blazar heating .",
    "our standard model is normalized to the observed number of tev blazars , accounts for an incompleteness correction for incomplete sky coverage at tev energies and duty cycle , employs conservative assumptions of spectral corrections and contributing source classes for blazar heating , and has a heating rate of @xmath67 at @xmath68 ( paper ii ) . the heating rate in the optimistic model is a factor two larger , implying a rate of @xmath69 at @xmath68 and matches the inverted temperature - density relation found in high - redshift observations @xcite .",
    "since any mechanism that injects energy will produce a corresponding increase in @xmath59 , in the absence of cooling the entropy accumulates monotonically regardless of the mechanism responsible for heating the igm .",
    "nevertheless , some general statements can be made about the distinction between photoheating and that due to blazars .",
    "due to the ionization balance maintained between recombination and photoionization , photoheating produces a generic entropy injection profile following the epoch of reionization ; this is simply the `` loss of memory '' effect @xcite . in the absence of the blazar component , photoheating of hydrogen",
    "is the main source of heating for the universe at mean density at late times .",
    "the heating rate is given by the rate at which hydrogen recombines and is then reionized .",
    "in photoionization equilibrium , the temperature of the system will adjust such that the timescales of the net photoheating and recombination cooling rates become equal implying a steady state . since recombination",
    "does not depend on the uv photon density the rate of photoionization is also independent of the uv photon density .",
    "hence the late time photoheating of the igm is independent of the number of ionizing photons , and thus the number of ionizing sources ( above the ionization threshold ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the photoheating contribution to the igm entropy at @xmath68 is limited to near @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "such an argument does not work for blazar heating . here",
    "the efficiency is close to the maximum of 100% all the time , and the inverse compton cooling rate , @xmath72 , and scales as @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that the nonlinear damping rate is equal ( or of order ) the linear growth rate ( see section 3.5 of paper i ) . for the linear growth rate of the oblique instability ,",
    "this efficiency is close to unity for luminous blazars ( paper i ) .",
    "numerical simulations for a mildly relativistic pair beam penetrating into a hot , dense background plasma suggest that a significant fraction ( @xmath74 ) of the beam energy is heating the background plasma through the oblique instability before the two - stream plasma instability takes over , potentially dissipating another fraction of the beam kinetic energy @xcite . ]",
    "provided there are sufficient numbers of ebl photons and each point in space is reached by a number of blazar beams of tev photons ( which is likely the case ; see section 3.2 of paper ii ) .",
    "therefore , the heating rate , and thus temperature of the igm , is nearly linearly dependent upon the vhegr luminosity density of tev blazars .",
    "correspondingly , the entropy injection from blazars depends sensitively upon the history of the tev blazar population , and thus the cumulative contribution of blazars to the present - day @xmath59 is somewhat uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , given our conservative estimate of the blazar luminosity density in paper i , fixing it to the quasar luminosity density , we find that blazar heating raises the entropy substantially , starting around the epoch of he ii reionization ( @xmath75 ) and by @xmath68 , the inclusion of blazar heating raises the entropy of the @xmath71 fluid element to @xmath76 , approximately an order of magnitude larger than the case of photoheating alone .     versus @xmath77 ) for @xmath78 ( red diamonds ) , 1 ( green triangles ) , 2 ( blue squares ) , 3 ( black circles ) , and 4 ( cyan inverted triangles ) for a pure photoheating model .",
    "]      +     +    as discussed in paper ii , the magnitude of the temperature enhancement due to blazar heating is density dependent : while the photoheating rate depends linearly on density , blazar heating is independent of density and dominates photoheating for regions with @xmath79 .",
    "thus , blazar heating is expected to have the largest effects in voids . in figures [ fig : entropy eos ] and [ fig : entropy blazar ] we show the entropy - density relation ( @xmath59 vs.  @xmath77 ) for a variety of redshifts , ranging from @xmath78 to @xmath80 . for comparison ,",
    "figure [ fig : entropy eos ] shows the case of photoheating only : the entropy - density relation reflects the effect of photoionization which deposits a uniform energy per baryon during h and he ii reionization implying @xmath81 .",
    "this effect is quickly erased due to the `` loss of memory '' effect as well as adiabatic cooling due to the hubble expansion approaching an asymptotically constant entropy - density relation at late times .",
    "figure [ fig : entropy blazar ] shows the effect of tev blazar heating on the entropy - density relation for our standard ( top ) and optimistic ( bottom ) model . as expected , blazars have the most dramatic effects upon @xmath59 in low - density regions ( @xmath82 ) due to the spatially uniform and igm density independence of their volumetric heating rate .",
    "steepens _ the entropy - density relation , causing it to approach an asymptotics of @xmath83 in voids .",
    "in fact , blazar - induced entropies can exceed those due to photoionization by a factor of @xmath84@xmath85 in these low - density regions ( @xmath82 , see right - hand panels of figure [ fig : entropy blazar ] ) , reaching @xmath86@xmath87 by @xmath78 . for high density regions ( @xmath88 ) the effect",
    "is still pronounced , increasing the igm entropy by up to an order of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath89@xmath90 at @xmath78 .",
    "apart from increasing the mean entropy , blazar heating also increases the scatter in entropy at fixed density which is especially noticeable for @xmath78 .",
    "fractionally , this scatter appears to be roughly twice as large when blazar heating is included , though in absolute terms the scatter is much larger for the blazar cases .",
    "this is because even in linear theory , the entropy ( and temperature ) of any patch of overdensity @xmath91 depends on its `` collapse '' history . namely , whether it collapses like a zeldovich pancake , i.e. , in one dimension first which implies a smaller entropy and temperature , or more spherically which produces a greater entropy and temperature , i.e. , more akin to accretion onto a local overdensity .",
    "the fractional scatter in @xmath92 is much larger than that found in either entropy individually .",
    "the reason is that the scatter induced by blazar heating is anti - correlated with that induced by photoheating due to their very different dependencies upon igm density .",
    "patches that begin at low densities when blazar heating is ignored are biased toward lower entropies as a consequence of an extended period of slow recombination .",
    "when blazar heating is included , these same patches are more efficiently heated , and therefore biased toward higher entropies .",

    "the core entropy structure is set by gravitational formation shocks leading to a central entropy of @xmath107 . in the preheating case ,",

    "hence , we naively may not expect blazar heating to have a large impact upon the x - ray luminosity and entropy profiles of clusters . however , this is not the case for two reasons .",
    "first , the mass accretion rate , defined by the logarithmic slope @xmath123 , is larger for more massive systems and at higher redshifts ( where we have introduced the cosmic scale factor , @xmath124 ; see bottom panel of figure  [ f : macc ] ) .",
    "the mass accretion history of a halo observed at @xmath68 grows on average as @xmath125 @xcite .",

    "hence we find ourselves in the fast accretion regime if the mass accretion rate is larger than a characteristic value usually taken to be @xmath128 .",
    "in particular , the relative mass accretion rates increase from @xmath68 to 2 by a factor 3 for clusters ( @xmath129 ) and 10 for groups ( @xmath130 ) ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a larger relative mass accretion rate implies that the gas in the core is heated by accretion processes at a faster rate .",
    "this means that a lower preheated core entropy value early - on can in principle be gravitationally processed at a substantially higher rate and , as a result of this , move onto a higher adiabat with a longer cooling time .",
    "second , blazars like agns follow the clustering bias of the matter density field and hence turn on first in highly biased regions , i.e. , regions that evolve into clusters and super - clusters . at late times",
    "( @xmath131 ) blazar heating is expected to be nearly spatially uniform , since more than a single blazar contribute significantly to the local heating rate of any given patch of the universe ( paper ii ) . at much lower redshifts ,",
    "the number of contributing sources grows dramatically , approaching @xmath132 at @xmath68 , and thus today blazar heating is nearly homogeneous .",

    "by @xmath135 as much as 75% of the local heating can be due to a single object , implying large poisson fluctuations in the heating rate .",
    "this results in a clustering bias at early times .",
    "the rare first blazars are expected to appear in highly biased regions , corresponding to those that later evolve into groups and clusters , and therefore themselves be clustered .",
    "the likelihood of a patch of the universe being heated by such a blazar is then enhanced in the biased regions , where both the heating rate is larger ( since the vhegr density is larger ) and the probability of being covered by a blazar in the cluster is larger . ) due to the frequent occurrence of blazars . ]",
    "it is this early preheating in groups that may facilitate their evolution into ncc clusters ( via the gravitational reprocessing of the high - entropy cores ) .",
    "therefore , while we will focus upon group / small - cluster mass scale in our study of the entropy structure immediately after group / cluster formation , gravitational reprocessing combined with the bias in the early blazars suggest that these effects may be important for more massive clusters as well , propagating the effect of blazar heating up the mass hierarchy .",
    "the formation time of groups and clusters determines the blazar contribution to their entropy , inducing an intrinsic scatter in the @xmath35 relation associated with the distribution of collapse histories . as a result",
    ", we would expect to find systematically higher entropies in younger groups and possibly clusters provided gravitational reprocessing was effective .",
    "there is some evidence that this is the case .",
    "optically selected , and therefore young , group and cluster samples have on average lower x - ray surface brightness and smaller gas mass fractions compared to x - ray - selected samples @xcite . optically bright , small to moderately massive clusters ( @xmath136 ) at redshifts @xmath137@xmath138 are under - luminous in x - rays for a given @xmath31 , which implies a reduced gas density and by extension an enhanced core entropy by roughly a factor of two @xcite .",

    "most of the ultimately accreted gas is not smoothly distributed , but rather contained within virialized substructures , and therefore has already been shock heated , fundamentally altering the way in which the entropy profile is generated .",
    "this results in a more complex morphology of the dissipating structure - formation shocks , which exhibit a rich network of shock fronts at which the gravitational energy of the gas is dissipated @xcite . nevertheless , despite this apparent chaos , non - radiative galaxy cluster simulations",
    "that have sufficiently high resolution find approximately self - similar entropy , density , and temperature structures outside of the core region , independent of the numerical method used @xcite , yielding a universal entropy profile of @xmath150 the reason for this is that the low entropy / high density gas arranges itself such that it finds itself at the bottom of the gravitational potential and eventually mixes with the surrounding halo gas as can be seen by rewriting the hydrostatic equation , @xmath151 magnetic draping of cluster fields during gravitational settling provides a thermal insulation of these low - entropy parcels @xcite , and hence this settling occurs adiabatically , producing a stratified core in which the hot , high - entropy halo gas remains at large radii .      +        if the universe is preheated , the central entropy of a newly formed group or cluster is replaced with a flattened core .",
    "initially , the entropy of the core is set by that of the igm at the time the second gas shell is accreted , forming an accretion shock and adiabatically compressing the gas in the first . employing only heating by blazars and structure formation shocks , we show the resulting entropy profiles for groups of a variety of virial masses and formation redshifts in figure [ fig : k_r ] , exploring the distribution around the median object mass .",

    "an abundant population of late - forming groups with high @xmath207-values ( that has not been taken into account in any numerical modeling of the sz power spectrum so far , e.g. , by @xcite or @xcite ) would furthermore reduce the thermal sz power spectrum in comparison to these numerical approaches .",
    "this has potentially important observational consequences since angular scales around @xmath199 are the sweet spot for current telescopes measuring the high-@xmath208 cmb angular power spectrum , e.g. , the south pole telescope ( spt ; * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to the astrophysical dependence , the amplitude of the sz power spectrum also depends very sensitively on cosmological parameters that are responsible for the growth of structure , @xmath209 , where the rms amplitude of the ( linear ) density power spectrum on cluster - mass scales is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "hence , there is an interesting degeneracy in the amplitude ( and shape ) of the sz power spectrum between the cosmological information ( dominated by @xmath4 ) and the astrophysical information contained in the average pressure profile .",
    "currently , numerical models of the sz power spectrum are consistent with the data at the 1 @xmath210 level @xcite . however , after allowing for a substantial signal from patchy reionization @xcite , which boosts the kinetic sz effect and hence the total sz signal , the power predicted by these models becomes uncomfortably high .",
    "suppression of power due to blazar heating represents a promising mechanism by which to reconcile the expected and observed sz power spectrum .",

    ", we can perform sz tomography . such tomographic sz power spectra ( similar to figures 7 and 8 of * ? ? ? * for the case of agn feedback ) will enable us to derive a redshift and mass - dependent mean cluster pressure profile .",
    "potentially , this could disentangle the different non - gravitational energy injections of agn feedback and blazar heating in clusters . however , large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are required to obtain detailed predictions of either process which shall be subject to future work .",
    "the entropy injected into the igm by blazars not only modifies the structures of groups and potentially clusters , but also has an observable effect upon cosmological structure formation . heating the igm produces higher igm pressures , which in turn suppress the gravitational instability on sufficiently small scales .",
    "thus , there is a characteristic length scale , and hence characteristic mass ( @xmath211 ) , below which objects will not form .",
    "the particular value of this critical mass depends upon how structures form in practice , and generally requires a fully nonlinear study of structure formation ( e.g. , that provided by large - scale numerical simulations ) .",
    "nevertheless , we may estimate the relevant characteristic length and mass scales via linear perturbation theory .    a very rough idea of the impact of blazar heating",

    "that is , blazar heating increases the mass of the smallest collapsed objects by more than an order of magnitude with the exact value depending on the adopted numbers of blazars contributing to the heating .",
    "while the jeans mass provides a way to estimate the importance of blazar heating , @xmath217 typically exceeds @xmath211 by up to an order of magnitude because it neglects the hubble expansion .",
    "that is , it fails to account for the time required for the pressure to influence the evolving gas distribution .",
    "a more rigorous treatment of linearized density perturbations in a baryon - dark matter fluid finds that the overdensity in dark matter , @xmath223 , and the overdensity in the baryon distribution , @xmath224 , both of which are functions of time and comoving wavenumber , are related by @xmath225 for some @xmath226 @xcite . the `` filtering scale '' , associated with @xmath226 , defines a size",

    "the associated mass scale , defined in analogy with the jeans mass , is @xmath230 ( the details of how this is computed in practice are collected in appendices [ sec : mf ] and [ sec : mf_eds ] ) . to understand the physics underlying the filtering mass , it is instructive to connect the filtering mass to the entropy of the igm . to this end",
    ", we use the definition for the entropy @xmath60 of equation  . as we show in appendix [",
    "sec : mf ] , the filtering scale @xmath231 is an integral over the entropy evolution , @xmath232 here @xmath233 is the dimensionless hubble function . since @xmath234 , the linear filtering mass",
    "is also determined by the entropy evolution at mean density and appropriately scaled with the linear growth function , hubble function , and cosmic scale factor . since",
    "the integrand in equation  ( [ eq : k_f_entropy ] ) is a positive definite function , the linear filtering mass increases monotonically with time .",
    "we expect the strong increase of the entropy due to blazar heating to drive a comparably strong increase in @xmath235 , though slightly delayed due to the effective weighting function in @xmath235 .",
    "physically , this implies that the entropy floor delivered by photo- or blazar heating at densities around the cosmic mean is then conserved by adiabatic compression during structure formation and directly translates to a linear filtering mass @xmath235 .",
    "however , during this nonlinear process of structure formation , the entropy can be additionally augmented through dissipation of gravitational energy in cosmic structure - formation shocks or decreased through radiative cooling .",
    "the competition of these two processes determines which will dominate and in turn sets the critical mass @xmath211 which is required for the condensation of gas into a dark matter halo and eventually the formation of a galaxy .    as with @xmath217",
    ", @xmath235 typically exceeds the @xmath211 observed in simulations by a substantial factor .",
    "whether a halo can accrete gas is determined by the gas temperature ( or equivalently entropy ) at the virial radius which can only be obtained through hydrodynamic cosmological simulations . estimated values for this critical mass using cosmological simulations of nonlinear structure formation with only photoheating yield @xmath236 @xcite",

    "the range indicates the uncertainty of the blazar heating models and the larger value belongs to the model that matches the inverted temperature - density relation in the forest found by @xcite , i.e. , the optimistic model .",
    "the resulting estimates for the nonlinear characteristic mass @xmath211 are also shown in figure  [ fig : m_f ] with red lines for our models with and without blazar heating .",
    "apparently the increase of @xmath211 due to blazar heating is able to counteract the suppression of @xmath235 in nonlinear theory .",
    "we note that our estimate for @xmath211 is slightly decreasing for @xmath244 in the model that employs only photoheating .",
    "this decrease is an artifact of our linear theory @xmath235 which by construction does not model nonlinear aspects of structure formation such as shell crossing or formation shocks that raise the temperature of some patches already at mean density .",
    "we now turn to two outstanding problems in cosmological structure formation that the recent blazar heating may help to address : the missing satellite ( section [ sec : mwms ] ) and void dwarf ( section [ sec : vd ] ) problems .",
    "finally in section [ sec : wdm ] we discuss how blazar heating may naturally address some of the difficulties with wdm cosmologies of galaxy formation .",
    "the heating due to blazars provides an additional mechanism to suppress the formation of dwarfs . unlike photoionization models , which typically invoke the heating at reionization , blazar heating provides a well defined , time - dependent suppression mechanism , with the suppression rising dramatically after @xmath1",
    "this can be seen explicitly by the steep increase in filtering mass for these redshifts in figure  [ fig : m_f ] .",
    "in addition , due to the homogeneous nature of the heating , i.e. , a constant volumetric rate that is independent of density , the heating from blazars suppresses structure formation most efficiently in the low - density regions responsible for late - forming dwarf halos due to their negative bias , where the energy deposited per baryon is larger .",
    "in fact , the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies provide a strong constraint upon the magnitude of blazar heating : if dwarf galaxy formation is suppressed by high - energy gamma - ray emission from blazars , all dwarf star formation histories must begin prior to @xmath245 , roughly the redshift at which blazar heating becomes significant . over the past decade",
    "most of local group dwarfs have been observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ shifting the focus from counting dwarfs to resolving the individual stellar population within these objects .",
    "thus , it has become possible to construct detailed color - magnitude diagrams of every dwarf galaxy and therefore their detailed star formation histories @xcite .",
    "while the data shows a great variety of star formation histories  some continuous , some bursty , some truncated  they all have in common that they extend beyond a lookback time of @xmath246 ( corresponding to @xmath29 ) .",
    "there is no known case of a dwarf galaxy that formed its first set of stars after @xmath245 .",
    "the fact that there exists an old stellar population in every dwarf in the local group provides a very important test that our model of blazar heating successfully passes .    the degree to which blazar heating can suppress the number of dwarf galaxies depends upon the redshifts at which they are typically formed .",
    "by combining high - resolution @xmath247-body simulations of the evolution of galaxy - sized halo with semianalytic models of galaxy formation , @xcite and @xcite have inferred the statistics , formation time , such that h  i cooling of the gas becomes possible in these halos . that virial temperature corresponds to a mass threshold of @xmath248 at @xmath117 and @xmath249 at @xmath250 . ] and accretion histories of the milky way satellites .",
    "their findings are in good agreement with recent work by other groups @xcite and thus can be regarded as representative for this model class .",
    "they find that the distribution of formation times is bimodal as a result of the suppression of hot gas accretion in low - mass halos due to the photoionization background ; while @xmath251 of today s satellites form at redshifts ranging from @xmath252 , @xmath253 of all satellites form late at @xmath254 with most of them at @xmath255 . because their formation is marked by the first time h  i cooling",
    "can effectively form the first stars , their stellar populations are necessarily younger than their formation time of @xmath256 in direct conflict with observed ages of the stellar populations in all of the local group dwarfs . ]",
    "@xcite . the model of @xcite that successfully reproduced the satellite luminosity function of the milky way assumed the linear theory filtering mass (",
    "* see solid blue line in figure  [ fig : m_f ] ) which was shown to significantly overproduce the characteristic halo mass scale below which baryons can not condense and form stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see solid red line in figure  [ fig : m_f ] ) . adopting their less efficient nonlinear filtering mass formalism , the number of satellite galaxies with intermediate magnitudes @xmath257 increases and creates a bump in the luminosity function which is clearly inconsistent with the data @xcite .",
    "inspection of nonlinear estimates for the filtering mass @xmath235 in figure [ fig : m_f ] shows that heating from blazars could prevent the condensation of baryons in halos of masses @xmath258 at redshifts @xmath259 and likely up to @xmath260 at @xmath68 . at mean density ,",
    "these nonlinear estimates for @xmath235 correspond to the original linear values of @xcite which have been shown to yield the observed dwarf satellite abundances and luminosity functions @xcite . at the same time , the strongly rising @xmath235 in the blazar heating models after @xmath259 is able to suppress the population of late - forming dwarfs @xcite that are in conflict with measured star formation histories of dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus , not only can blazar heating potentially play a significant role in explaining the observed abundances of dwarf galaxies but also their old star formation histories .    finally , we argue that the redshift evolution of the blazar heating rate should manifest itself as stochasticity in the satellite luminosity function at fixed host halo mass .",
    "host halos show a distribution of formation times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this distribution is inherited by the host s satellite dwarfs which on average form earlier than the host .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ f : thermal history ] , blazar heating implies an entropy floor that dramatically increases after @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the distribution of formation times of satellite dwarfs at fixed host halo mass results in a distribution of pre - collapsed entropy of these dwarf halos . as a result",
    ", this leaves early - forming dwarfs relatively unchanged but suppresses the baryon fraction or even the formation of late - forming dwarfs .",
    "this results in different cooling histories for different dwarfs , which , in turn , might modify the stellar content that condenses out in these systems .",
    "hence , blazar heating provides an apparently substantial , physically motivated scatter in the satellite luminosity function , or distribution of mass - to - light ratio at fixed host halo mass .",
    "this physically motivated stochasticity has important implications for abundance matching techniques that need to be taken into account and complicates their use .",
    "we note that some of this stochasticity is already seen in mildly nonlinear theory ( which captures some aspects of the formation history ) and manifests itself as a scatter in entropy at large 1+@xmath91 in figure  [ fig : entropy blazar ] .      as outlined in section  [ sec : intro_dwarf ] , the `` void phenomenon '' is closely related to the substructure problem .",
    "both show a strong discrepancy in the abundance of dark matter ( sub-)halos and paucity of luminous dwarf galaxies that are thought to be hosted by these halos . before we discuss in detail how blazar heating impacts on dwarf galaxies in voids , we review the latest discussion on the status of the problem itself which has recently been disputed to even exist .    using a halo occupation distribution model approach , @xcite claim to have explained the problem as they find agreement between luminosity functions , nearest neighbor statistics , and void probability function of faint galaxies .",
    "however , a very high resolution simulation of the local volume of 8 mpc around the milky way predicts a factor of 10 more dwarf halos than observed dwarf galaxies in mini - voids with sizes ranging from 1 to 4.5 mpc , hence reinforcing the `` void phenomenon '' @xcite . while the agreement between theory and observations is good for dwarfs with masses @xmath261 ( corresponding to maximum circular velocities of @xmath262 ) , .",
    "this seems to be a conservative choice when comparing to the critical mass threshold of @xmath263 or equivalently @xmath264 which assumed a @xmath265 . for consistency reasons with the literature , in section  [ sec : structure formation ] , this section",
    ", we define the virial mass , @xmath266 , as the mass of a sphere enclosing a mean density that is 200 times the _ mean _ density of the universe . ]",
    "it fails below , suggesting that @xcite did not sample the relevant mass scales .",
    "moreover , their analysis only demonstrated the self - consistency of the halo occupation distribution model and did not make a comparison between observations and the predictions of @xmath49cdm .",
    "the discrepancy of the luminosity function on dwarf scales is confirmed by other recent studies that compare the circular velocity function of h  i observations with those obtained through dissipationless simulations @xcite . at @xmath267 ( corresponding to @xmath268 ) ,",
    "the latest study finds a slight deviation between theory and observations which amounts to a significant overprediction of more than 10 times the number of observed systems at @xmath269 . while completeness of the observed samples could be an explanation of some of the differences , it is unlikely that it can account for all of the observed effects since the blind h  i sample of the hipass survey is thought to be complete down to @xmath270 out to a distance of 5  mpc @xcite .",
    "since gas - rich galaxies dominate at the low mass end of the luminosity function , their sample should give an accurate measurement of the abundance of dwarfs if these galaxies contain enough neutral gas to be detected .    while blazar heating significantly increases the entropy , and hence the associated filtering mass , at mean density",
    ", it does so more dramatically within the voids . to address how this substantially increased heating manifests itself in the number of void dwarfs ,",
    "it is instructive to compare the formation timescales of dwarf halos as a function of environment .",
    "void dwarf galaxies are negatively biased and form later than their field or cluster analogs ( halos of a given mass tend to be older in clusters and younger in voids for masses smaller than the typical mass scale that is presently entering the nonlinear regime of perturbation growth ) .",
    "this is because for galaxies forming on a large - scale underdense mode , more time has to elapse before these galaxies acquire enough overdensity to decouple from the hubble expansion and subsequently collapse .",
    "thus , the median redshift of formation for a dwarf galaxy with halo mass @xmath271 is @xmath272 within cluster and 1.6 in voids @xcite",
    ". moreover , the distribution of formation times of void galaxies is more sharply confined around the median value than those for clusters , which exhibit a long tail of formation redshifts , extending to @xmath273 @xcite .",
    "our estimate of @xmath211 in underdense regions with @xmath274 demonstrates that blazar heating prevents the condensation of baryons in halos of masses of @xmath258 at redshifts @xmath275 and @xmath276 at @xmath68 ( see figure  [ fig : m_f ] ) . in particular , halos of @xmath277 can be suppressed after @xmath278 which is earlier than the median formation redshift of these galaxies .",
    "depending on the exact definition of voids , this suggests that more than half of the galaxies with masses @xmath279 , corresponding to a maximum circular velocity of @xmath280 , can be suppressed or severely affected by blazar heating .",
    "such a preheated entropy floor not only suppresses dwarf formation at late times ( @xmath5 ) , but may also modify galaxy formation at the low - mass end . assuming that low - mass halos are embedded in a preheated medium with an entropy floor of @xmath281 at @xmath5 simultaneously matches data at the faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function as well as of the h   i - mass function @xcite .",
    "this heuristic assumption almost exactly coincides with the predictions of our blazar heating models ( see figure  [ f : thermal history ] ) . as a result of such a preheating , only a fraction of the gas in a proto - galaxy region",
    "would be able to cool and be accreted into the final galaxy halo by the present time .",
    "if the accreted gas resides in the diffuse phase , it does not lose angular momentum to the dark matter , thereby possibly continuing to form large galaxy discs in low - density environments @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the entropy floor and filtering mass due to blazar heating are dramatically increased in voids as a result of the constant volumetric heating rate , which leads to an inverted temperature - density relation in low - density regions ( paper ii ) . in combination with the later formation epoch of dwarfs at these low densities , this implies a very efficient mechanism for suppressing void dwarf formation in collapsed dark matter halos .",
    "hence , our model provides an elegant physical solution to the void phenomenon described by @xcite .",
    "recent dissipationless @xmath49cdm simulations produce not only far too many dark matter satellites but also show that the most massive subhalos in simulations of the milky way may be too dense to host any of its observed bright satellites with luminosities @xmath282 , i.e. , these massive satellites in simulations attain their maximum circular velocity at too small radii in comparison to the observed dwarf satellites @xcite .",
    "these dark subhalos have circular velocities at infall of @xmath283 and infall masses of @xmath284 . in principle , this puzzle can be solved ( or partially solved ) in the following ways : by increasing the stochasticity of galaxy formation on these scales , by reducing the central ( dark matter ) densities by means of very efficient and violent baryonic feedback processes acting on timescales much faster than the free - fall time , by assuming a total mass of the milky way at the lower end of the allowed uncertainty interval ( i.e. , @xmath285 ) in combination with a shallower subhalo density profile of the einasto form as measured in simulations @xcite , or by allowing these subhalos to initially form with lower concentrations as would be the case , for example , if the dark matter were made of warm , rather than cold particles @xcite .    in the limit of heavy wdm particles , e.g. , the ( sterile ) neutrino with @xmath286 that is created in the early universe through mixing with an active neutrino",
    ", structure formation proceeds almost indistinguishably from cdm for all current observational probes @xcite . for smaller masses , however , the free streaming of neutrinos erases all fluctuations on scales smaller than the free streaming length , which is roughly proportional to their temperature and inversely proportional to their mass .",
    "using the forest power spectrum measured by the sloan digital sky survey and high - resolution spectroscopy observations in combination with cmb and galaxy clustering constraints still allows for a neutrino with mass @xmath287 ( 95% c.l . ) that decoupled early while in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "inferred by high - redshift studies @xcite , it is not clear whether these limits on sterile neutrino properties are weakened in the presence of blazar heating . ]",
    "dissipationless high - resolution simulations of the evolution of a galaxy - sized halo have shown that ( sub-)halos form and are accreted later onto the main halo in wdm scenarios compared to the standard cdm paradigm , due to the lack of power on small scales in wdm @xcite . in wdm scenarios with relatively low values of the particle masses , @xmath288  kev ,",
    "there are almost no halos with @xmath289 , suggesting that the fraction of late - forming dwarfs @xmath290 is increased over the cdm scenario .",
    "this late formation epoch of dwarfs reinforces the star formation history problem of local group dwarfs : these late - forming dwarfs contain young stellar populations , in direct conflict with the old ages of the stellar populations ( @xmath291  gyr ) in all of the local group dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , these are precisely the objects that blazar heating most strongly affects , as the strongly rising filtering mass ( or entropy floor ) after @xmath1 is able to suppress the population of these late - forming dwarfs . hence , while in this scenario the free streaming of wdm erases power on scales smaller than dwarfs , blazar heating reconciles the theoretically expected and the observed star formation histories and alleviates standard objections to galaxy formation in wdm cosmologies .      in the previous sections",
    ", we argued that a blazar - heated entropy floor is able to suppress late dwarf formation in voids and the milky way as well as modify the thermodynamical profiles of galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "hence , it is natural to ask whether there would be any effect of blazar heating on @xmath47 galaxy formation which represents the mass scale in between these two extremes .",
    "blazar heating is not powerful enough to raise the mean temperature at @xmath71 of even the most extreme patches above @xmath292 ( see figure  9 in paper ii ) .",
    "the classical criteria of galaxy formation are a short cooling time compared to the dynamical time and to the age of the universe , @xmath293 and @xmath294 @xcite , which are easily fulfilled even in the presence of blazar heating ( see , e.g. , figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that these galaxies can radiate away the additional entropy that the gas attained prior to collapse due to blazar heating within a free - fall time .",
    "it is , however , interesting to speculate whether the blazar - heated high - entropy gas at low redshift @xmath244 has any impact on the late accretion of gas into the hot reservoir of baryons from which gas cools and fuels the late time star formation .",
    "higher entropy gas should shock further out in the halo than pre - cooled gas of lower entropy which is denser and can provide a larger ram pressure .",
    "blazar heated gas has high entropy and is more dilute .",
    "hence , it is more easily torqued ( by dissipative processes or magnetic fields ) and therefore change its angular momentum distribution .",
    "thus , it is implausible that blazar heating dramatically changes the ordinary mode of galaxy formation , but we might anticipate blazar heating to starve the late - time accretion and potentially slow down subsequent star formation .",
    "these ideas are subject to verification by numerical simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "tev blazar heating results in a dramatic increase in the entropy of the igm following he ii reionization around @xmath75 . since the igm entropy evolution is critical for the formation and structure of collapsed objects , blazars heating has a significant impact upon both .",
    "we have identified two mass ranges ( or classes of objects ) for which the tev blazar - induced entropy floor should have a substantial effect .",
    "_ galaxy groups and clusters _ , which are forming near the peak entropy injection rate ( @xmath3 ) and exhibit core entropies that are comparable to that implied by blazar heating ; and _ dwarf galaxies _ , which are susceptible to the rapidly rising entropy floor generated by blazars .",
    "below , we describe the consequences for each in more detail .    _ galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "_ immediately after formation , groups at fixed mass should have a continuous distribution of core entropy values , depending on the formation redshift and the temporally variable heating mechanism .",
    "the fate of these groups is determined by the ratio of the cooling time , @xmath197 , to the timescale between cluster / group mergers , @xmath295 .",
    "if this ratio is smaller than unity , the group can radiate the elevated core entropy away and evolve into a cc which survives the successive hierarchical growth .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath296 , merger shocks can gravitationally reprocess the entropy cores and amplify them .",
    "those groups can then evolve into ncc systems .",
    "hence , it is not necessary to produce all of the observed central entropy in the igm before collapse , but it is also possible to achieve this through gravitational heating , provided there is a certain minimum entropy delivered by some putative heating process corresponding to a minimum @xmath197 .",
    "an increasing entropy floor also implies an increasing cooling time , hence the cluster - averaged @xmath297 increases .",
    "it follows that systems that evolve into cc systems _ today _ are on average early - forming , i.e. , old systems .",
    "in contrast , nccs are on average young systems .",
    "we argue that systems with a unimodal distribution in core entropy values after group formation should naturally evolve into a bimodal distribution .",
    "the reason for this are the two attractor solutions of the group / cluster system , driven by the cooling instability and gravitational reprocessing of ( temporally increasing ) elevated entropy cores , resulting in the observed populations of cc and ncc systems , respectively .",
    "such an elevated entropy core level in groups might explain a population of x - ray dim groups with low gas fractions .",
    "we show that the core entropy values in cc clusters have a very weak correlation with the mechanical energy and power of x - ray cavities inflated by agns .",
    "apparently , @xmath183 work done by the expanding cavities is an inefficient heating process that does not generate much entropy .",
    "this strongly suggests that while agn feedback seems to be critical in stabilizing cc systems , it can not transform cc into ncc systems ( at least on the buoyancy timescale ) .",
    "our blazar - induced entropy history seems to be well matched for the formation times of today s groups , but at first sight less so for clusters which form in highly biased regions through mergers of groups .",
    "those had to form even earlier when the entropy for the _ average _ igm was still rising with typical values at @xmath157 of @xmath298 .",
    "however , two effects positively interfere to counteract the apparently smaller effect of blazar heating in clusters .",

    "this suggests that the earlier forming group progenitors of clusters can tolerate a smaller blazar - heated entropy floor after collapse which will then be gravitationally processed at a faster rate and able to counteract the smaller cooling timescales .",
    "second , blazars also turn on first in highly biased regions , and thus the igm in the vicinity of clusters should experience blazar heating earlier than low - density regions .",
    "we speculate that this effect in combination with the faster gravitational reprocessing of an elevated entropy core in denser regions would help in propagating the effect of blazar heating to the scale of massive clusters .    changing the thermodynamic structure of groups and potentially clusters",

    "the range indicates the uncertainty in the number of blazars that contribute to the heating and the upper envelope matches the observations of an inverted temperature - density relation in the forest .",

    "it also brings the observed early star formation histories of local group dwarfs into agreement with galaxy formation models that predicted a population of late - forming objects , in conflict with the data . at the same time , it provides a plausible explanation for the `` void phenomenon '' which is the apparent discrepancy of the number of dwarfs in low - density regions in cdm simulations and the paucity of those in observations .",
