    "although the standard model ( sm ) of the elementary particles explains precisely the data from the colliders , there are some remaining fundamental questions raised by the sm itself that do nt have any explanation .    for example radiative loop corrections to the higgs mass like in figure [ fig.mssm.divergences.loops ] give a correction @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the upper limit of the momentum .",
    "the leading term diverges quadratically ( the * quadratic divergency problem * ) .",
    "this divergence can be removed by introducing a cut - off scale on momentum .",
    "its value is the higher limit of energy upto which sm is valid .",
    "usually this limit is @xmath5 gev , at which gravity has a strength comparable to the other interactions and sm must be modified .",
    "this enormous disparity of scales between electroweak and @xmath6 is not natural and is called the * hierarchy problem * @xcite .",
    "if another scalar exists which couples to the higgs by a quartic interaction of the form @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig.mssm.divergences.loops](b ) ) , it contributes to the higgs mass by : @xmath8 \\label{eq.mssm.divergences.boson}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it also generates a quadratic divergence , but because of fermi statistics , its sign is opposite to the one of the fermions .",
    "assuming there are two scalar partners for every fermion with couplings @xmath9 the quadratic divergences cancel exactly .    to solve the hierarchy problem",
    "this theory should contain nearly degenerate fermions and scalars and adequately chosen couplings .",
    "it is exactly what * supersymmetry * ( susy ) postulates , the existence of supersymmetric partners for every sm particle , which have exactly the same quantum numbers and mass , but differ by 1/2 in their spin .",
    "the super partners of the fermions are called with same name starting with `` s '' , e.g stop , and the superpartners of bosons are called with same name ending with `` ino '' , e.g wino .",
    "susy particles have not been discovered yet , so they are not at the same mass as their sm partners .",
    "it means that supersymmetry is a broken symmetry and susy particles are heavier .",
    "there are different mechanisms to break this symmetry softly ( without generating quadrative divergencies ) . here",
    "we consider a very constrained scenario where gravity is responsible for susy breaking and the @xmath10 mass is produced by radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this model is called * msugra*. the particle masses and branching ratios in msugra are defined completely by only 5 parameters :    @xmath11 : :    commom scalar mass at the grand unification theories ( gut ) scale . @xmath12",
    ": :    commom gaugino mass at gut scale . @xmath13 : :    commom trillinear coupling at gut scale .",
    "tan@xmath14 : :    ratio of the vacuum expectation values for @xmath15 and    @xmath16 .",
    "sign(@xmath17 ) : :    @xmath17 is the higgs mixing parameter .    in the following the search for susy in a special channel in cms @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite which is going to start",
    "data taking in fall 2007 will be reviewed by one example emphasizing the role of the top quark as both signal and background .",
    "in cms an inclusive search for susy is done by looking for events with a top quark in the final states @xcite . for illustration a test point lm1 within the msugra scenario",
    "this point is defined by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the masses of the relevant particles ( in gev/@xmath23 ) are @xmath24 in this point , the top quark can be produced inclusively in the decay of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 accompanied by a neutralino ( the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) ) , which appears as a large missing transverse energy ( met , @xmath28 ) .",
    "so the idea is to see the excess in the number of the extracted top quarks , when a hard cut is applied on the missing transverse energy . to simulate the detector response ,",
    "the full simulation based on geant4 , oscar @xcite , is used . to extract the top quark , a two constraints kinematic fit",
    "is utilized @xcite .",
    "it is very useful because firstly it has a quantitative feature to reject the fake top quarks ( @xmath29 probability , see figure [ fig : chi2kinfit ] )    and also it can improve the kinematic features of the reconstructed top quark .",
    "figure [ fig.paktinat.kinfitimpr ]    shows the difference between the energy of the reconstructed ( fitted ) top quark and the generated top quark , when the generated top quark which is closer than @xmath30 to the reconstructed top quark decays hadronically and all its three partons have @xmath31 30 gev and @xmath32 2.5 .",
    "the main background is semileptonic @xmath33 when there is a potentially high value for @xmath34 and a hadronically decaying top quark . in these events @xmath34 and the fitted top quark are almost back - to - back in the transverse plane .",
    "this feature is used to suppress the @xmath33 background .",
    "the cuts were optimized both to suppress the sm background and also increase the ratio of the susy events with a generated top quark ` susy(withtop ) ' against the susy events without a generated top quark ` susy(notop ) ' , although these two sources are used as the number of extracted signal events . in order to do the mentioned suppressions the following cuts",
    "are applied :    1 .   the first level trigger ( l1 )",
    "l1jetmet @xcite ( a barrel jet with @xmath35 and @xmath36 gev ) .",
    "2 .   the high level trigger ( hlt ) hltjetmet ( a barrel jet with @xmath37 and @xmath38 gev ) .",
    "3 .   @xmath28 , @xmath39 150gev , as shown in figure [ fig.paktinat.metafetjetcut ] .",
    "4 .   at least 4 jets , with at least one of them b - tagged , jets with @xmath40 30 gev and @xmath32 2.5 . 5 .",
    "a convergent fit with @xmath29 probability @xmath39 0.1 .",
    "this cut is the most important cut to increase the ratio of susy(withtop ) against the susy(notop ) .",
    "@xmath41 between the fitted top quark and the @xmath42 2.6 .",
    "figure [ fig.paktinat.deltaphi ] + shows the distribution of this quantity for different samples",
    "at least one isolated electron or muon with @xmath43 5 gev/@xmath44 and @xmath32 2.5 .",
    "this cut is introduced to suppress the qcd multijet backgrounds .    after applying these cuts ,",
    "the only remaining background is @xmath33 .",
    "the ratio of the susy signal against the sm background is 11 , when almost 70% of the extracted susy events have a generated top quark ` susy(withtop ) ' .",
    "figure [ fig.paktinat.mettop ]    shows the distributions of missing transverse energy and the extracted top quark for different samples .",
    "it can be seen that the susy signal is well above the standard model ( @xmath33 ) background . including the systematic uncertainties on the background @xcite we estimate that the minimum integrated luminosity for a 5@xmath0 discovery is @xmath10.25 @xmath45 .",
    "note that the analysis uses systematic uncertainties that are realizable with 1 @xmath45 of data . for start - up ( 0.1 @xmath45 )",
    "a separate study of the uncertainties needs to be performed .",
    "to estimate the reach over the msugra parameter space we apply the analysis selection path using the fast simulation and reconstruction of cms , famos @xcite and with appropriate validation using the detailed simulation .",
    "the nlo cross section is calculated by prospino @xcite , assuming only the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 productions to be relevant . for 10 @xmath45",
    "the jet energy scale and @xmath49-tagging uncertainties expected are smaller compared to 1 @xmath45 @xcite . the jet energy scale relative uncertainty on the final result amounts to 11.3% while the relative systematic uncertainty from the @xmath49-tagging is 7% @xcite .",
    "the total relative systematic uncertainty is 13.7% .",

    "final states in @xmath11-@xmath12 plane and for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath22 .",
    "the shaded regions are excluded because either the @xmath52 would be the lsp or because there is no radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the regions excluded by the lep limit on the @xmath53 or the @xmath54 masses are delineated by dashed lines.,width=226 ]    the larger reach in the high @xmath11 region is due to the dominant three body decay of the gluino to top quark in this region .",
    "we present the observability study of low mass susy using an inclusive selection of events with a hadronically decaying top quark and large missing energy in the final state .",
    "we estimate that for the test point lm1 the 5@xmath0 discovery is achievable with 0.25 @xmath45 .",
