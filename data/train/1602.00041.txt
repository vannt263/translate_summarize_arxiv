    "perhaps one of the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics is the principle of superposition , which stipulates that an entity can exist simultaneously in multiple different states . bell and",
    "others indicated how experiments could distinguish between classical systems and those that demonstrate quantum superposition  @xcite .",
    "bell s inequality concerns correlations among measurements on spatially separated systems .",
    "leggett and garg developed an analogous test that concerns correlations among measurements performed on a system at different times , and they extended this test to apply to macroscopic entities  @xcite . sometimes referred to as the  time - analogue \" of bell s inequality , the leggett - garg inequality ( lgi ) allows for a complementary test of quantum mechanics while potentially avoiding some of the difficulties involved in performing a truly loophole - free test of bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "the original goal of lgi tests was to demonstrate macroscopic coherence  that is , that quantum mechanics applies on macroscopic scales up to the level at which many - particle systems exhibit decoherence @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a major focus of recent lgi research has been scaling up to tests with macroscopic systems .",
    "lgi tests have another purpose :  to test `` realism , '' the notion that physical systems possess complete sets of definite values for various parameters prior to , and independent of , measurement .",
    " realism \" is often encoded in hidden - variable theories , which allow for systems that are treated as identical according to quantum mechanics to be fundamentally distinguishable through a hidden set of parameters that they possess , such that any measurement on a system reveals a pre - existing value @xcite .",
    "lgi violations imply that such hidden - variable ( or `` realistic '' ) alternatives to quantum mechanics can not adequately describe a system s time evolution .",
    "experiments using few - particle systems can test  realism \" even if they do not directly address _ _",
    "macro__realism @xcite .",
    "neutrino flavor oscillations , which are coherent in the few - particle limit , provide an interesting system with which to test the lgi .",
    "neutrinos have been detected in three distinct `` flavors , '' which interact in particular ways with electrons , muons , and tau leptons , respectively .",
    "flavor oscillations occur because the flavor states are distinct from the neutrino mass states ; in particular , a given flavor state may be represented as a coherent superposition of the different mass states @xcite .",
    "neutrino flavor oscillations may be treated with the same formalism that is typically used to describe other systems displaying quantum coherence , such as squeezed atomic states  @xcite .",
    "the major difference between neutrinos and these familiar systems , however , is that the coherence length of neutrino oscillations  the length over which interference occurs and oscillations may be observed  extends over vast distances , even astrophysical scales @xcite .",
    "an lgi experiment using neutrino oscillations therefore presents a stark contrast to other types of lgi tests , which typically use photons , electrons , or nuclear spins , for which coherence distances are much more constrained @xcite .",
    "experimental violations of the lgi can lead to definitive conclusions about `` realism '' only if the measurement outcomes represent the underlying time evolution of the system .",
    "invasive measurements , characterized either by wavefunction collapse or by experimental imperfections that classically disrupt the system , would prevent an experimenter from ruling out realistic alternatives to quantum mechanics , even in the face of an apparent violation of the lgi .",
    "several experiments have worked to bypass this limitation by using indirect or weak measurements to probe the system  @xcite .    in the case of neutrino flavor oscillations , it is possible to circumvent the problems posed by invasivity by performing measurements on members of an identically prepared ensemble ; this obviates the issue of whether individual measurements influence one another .",
    "when combined with a separate assumption of `` stationarity''such that the correlations between different measurements depend only on the durations between them , rather than on their individual times  the prepared - ensemble condition allows one to test particular classes of  realistic \" alternatives to quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "although the idea of testing the lgi and related measures of quantum entanglement using neutrino oscillations has been proposed in the literature @xcite , we believe this is the first such empirical test to be performed .",
    "we consider a dichotomic observable @xmath1 ( with realizations @xmath2 ) that may be measured at various times @xmath3 .",
    "the correlation between measurements at times @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be written @xmath5 where @xmath6 indicates averaging over many trials . for measurements at @xmath7 distinct times , we may define the leggett - garg parameter @xmath8 as @xmath9 `` realistic '' systems obey the leggett - garg inequality @xcite , which for @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 .",
    "we may calculate an expected value for @xmath8 according to quantum mechanics , @xmath12 , by time - evolving @xmath1 under the unitary operator @xmath13 : @xmath14 . when it is possible to represent @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a vector of two - by - two pauli matrices , then for any complete set of normalized states @xmath18 , the two - time correlation function may be written @xmath19 we use the anticommutator @xmath20 to avoid possible time - ordering ambiguities , since @xmath21 need not commute with @xmath22 . in a quantum - mechanical system ,",
    "violations of the lgi arise due to the nonvanishing commutators of the operators @xmath15 and @xmath23 .",
    "if one artificially imposes that @xmath21 and @xmath23 must commute ( i.e. , taking the limit @xmath24 ) , then one recovers the classical prediction for @xmath8 , which we denote @xmath25 , and which has the compact expression @xmath26 given that @xmath27 is real and @xmath28 , we see that @xmath25 satisfies the lgi , whereas @xmath29 may violate the lgi for particular angles @xmath30 .",
    "the discrepancy between these two predictions provides an opening for experimental testing and verification  @xcite .",
    "the original derivation of the lgi assumed that measurements of @xmath1 at various times @xmath3 are made in a non - invasive manner @xcite .",
    "the lgi may be derived instead under the assumption of `` stationarity , '' such that the correlation functions @xmath27 depend only on the time difference @xmath31 between measurements @xcite . in this case",
    ", the bound @xmath32 applies to the class of `` realistic '' models that are markovian , for which the evolution of the system after some time @xmath33 is independent of the means by which the system arrived in a given state at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we may then consider measurements performed on distinct members of an identically prepared ensemble , each of which begins in some known initial state .",
    "stationarity allows for measurements made on distinct ensemble members to mimic a series of measurements made on a single time - evolving system .",
    "for example , in order to construct @xmath34 , we take advantage of the fact that @xmath35 in one system is equivalent to the correlation between measurements separated by time @xmath36 on a different member of the ensemble .",
    "the combination of the prepared - ensemble and stationarity conditions therefore acts as a substitute for measurement schemes intended to be non - invasive ( e.g. , weak measurements ) , because wavefunction collapse and classical disturbance in a given system do not influence previous or subsequent measurements on distinct members of the ensemble  @xcite . unlike the assumption of non - invasive measurability , moreover",
    ", the stationarity condition may be subjected to independent testing @xcite .",
    "as we will see , both the prepared - ensemble and stationarity conditions may be fulfilled in measurements of neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "furthermore , these two conditions enable us to analyze measurements on separate groups of particles ( directly analogous to measurements on spatially separated systems in tests of bell s inequality ) , circumventing the recent criticism of the lgi whereby measurements on a single system at later times may be influenced by the outcomes of earlier measurements on that same system  @xcite .",
    "the standard model includes three distinct neutrino flavors . however , the energies and distances on which we focus single out oscillations almost entirely between two flavor states .",
    "hence , we adopt a two - state approximation . in the relativistic limit",
    ", oscillations between these two states may be treated with the blch sphere formalism @xcite , which geometrically represents the space of pure states of a generic two - level system .",
    "the observable @xmath1 measures neutrino flavor as projected along a particular axis ( which we take to be @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 , with eigenvalues @xmath39 and @xmath40 , for muon- and electron - flavor neutrino states , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian for neutrino propagation in the two - flavor limit is given by ( setting @xmath41 ) @xcite @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the neutrino vacuum mixing angle , @xmath44 and @xmath45 label the distinct mass states , @xmath46 is the oscillation frequency , and @xmath47 is the relativistic neutrino momentum / energy .",

    "the overall phase is @xmath65 , consistent with the stationarity condition .",
    "furthermore , for an experimental arrangement in which measurements occur at a fixed distance @xmath66 from the neutrino source , we have @xmath67 in the relativistic limit . in that case , the phase varies only with the energy @xmath51 ; that is , @xmath68 .",
    "this means that we may use measurements at different _ frequencies _ @xmath55 , as opposed to different _ times _ , to probe the lgi .",
