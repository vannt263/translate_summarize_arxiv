    "the field of quantum plasmas has been introduced long ago @xcite and is presently attracting renewed attention from a variety of viewpoints . it was already confirmed that quantum mechanical effects , e.g. , electron tunneling and wave - packet spreading , play a central rle in the behavior of metallic or semiconductor nanostructures of the next generation electronic devices @xcite@xcite .",
    "some astrophysical compact objects , such as white dwarf or neutron stars , possess very high temperature but strong quantum effects as well due to their large densities ( @xmath0 g/@xmath1 ) @xcite . there has been recent studies in quantum plasmas involving quantum turbulence @xcite , quantum analogues for the harris sheet @xcite , quantum models taking into account spin @xcite , stable solitary structures @xcite , dark soliton and vortices solutions @xcite , variational structures for the quantum zakharov system @xcite as well as application of quantum hydrodynamic equations for carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the growing interest on quantum plasmas comes in part from the recently introduced hydrodynamic equations @xcite-@xcite , which are simpler in comparison to the kinetic descriptions used in the original developments .",
    "however , the weibel instability @xcite is usually treated in terms of kinetic descriptions .",
    "the weibel instability is one of the basic plasma instabilities and is driven by an anisotropic velocity distribution of plasma particles @xcite .",
    "the quantum version of the weibel instability has been recently proposed @xcite on grounds of the dispersion relation for the wigner - maxwell system , which is the quantum counterpart of the vlasov - maxwell system .",
    "therefore , the details of the instability are dependent on the precise form of the equilibrium wigner pseudo distribution function , in a similar way as the traditional weibel instability is partially dependent on the exact form of the classical equilibrium distribution function . the purpose of this paper is to overcome this difficulty by means of a moment description for the quantum weibel instability .",
    "recently , the classical weibel instability was investigated by basu @xcite taking moments of the vlasov - poisson system and the present work follows basically the same strategy . here , however , the starting point is the linearized wigner - maxwell system .",
    "it is also interesting to verify to what extent a fluid - like approach as the moment method is able to capture the essentials of the weibel instability , in the quantum case .",
    "some peculiar subtleties coming from the quantum nature of the model equations will show up .",
    "the transition from a kinetic to a fluid - like approach in a quantum plasma model will be shown to give rise to quantum effects of a different nature according to the density of the system , as explained more thoroughly in the continuation .",
    "classical plasmas frequently have equilibrium distribution functions anisotropic in velocity space @xcite-@xcite . in the context of quantum plasmas ,",
    "velocity anisotropy can arises at least for laser plasmas and neutron stars .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that anisotropic heating by resonant absorption can produce a weibel - like instability in laser plasmas . also , there are experimental evidence of weibel instability in laser - solid interaction experiments @xcite . in addition , in tunnel - ionized laser plasmas",
    "there can be velocity anisotropy driven by a varying laser polarization @xcite .",
    "quantum effects should be more evident in the next generation of laser - solid interaction experiments , where the densities are very high . for neutron stars",
    ", it has been conjectured @xcite that anisotropic heating can arise in view of fast rotation , implying a strongly deformed neutrino sphere and anisotropic neutrino fluxes .",
    "there are estimates @xcite where the pole - to - equator neutrino flux ratio can assume a value of 2 . for these reasons",
    ", it is important to have a better understanding of the weibel instability taking into account quantum effects .    as examples of distinct equilibrium wigner functions for the quantum weibel instability",
    ", one can have maxwell - boltzmann or fermi - dirac functions , both with anisotropy in velocity space . using a moment description , there is some lost of information , but more universal statements are made available . as for any moments or fluid modeling ,",
    "an intrinsic limit of such approach is in the closure of the equations .",
    "indeed , one is always faced with a system where the equation for the time evolution of the velocity moment of order @xmath2 depends on the velocity moment of order @xmath3 . in this way @xcite",
    ", it happens that the moment approach is appropriate only for long wave - length and large temperature anisotropy .",
    "moment descriptions have also been applied to cyclotron wave - particle interaction @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we construct the general formalism of the moment equations using the linearized wigner equation . assuming a large temperature anisotropy",
    ", we derive the new dispersion relation for the electromagnetic unstable modes of weibel - type , which includes quantum corrections appropriate for dilute systems . in sec .",
    "iii we generalize the analysis for an anisotropic fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the fourth - order moment term provides in this case a quantum correction term of a different nature in the dispersion relation .",
    "our quantum dispersion relations are discussed in sec .",
    "iv . the analytical forms for the weibel growth rates are derived and plotted for representative highly dense plasmas .",
    "a brief summary of the results is given in sec .",
    "consider a quantum plasma with equilibrium wigner function @xmath4 and no equilibrium electromagnetic field .",

    "it is convenient to define the first , second and third order moments @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the equilibrium density . from ( [ e1 ] ) , after integrating by parts and taking into account the coulomb gauge as well as the parity properties of @xmath19 , one get @xmath20 which are exactly the same as eqs .",
    "( 10 - 12 ) from basu s work @xcite , in a different notation . in ( [ e6]-[e8 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath23 and @xmath24 components of the perturbed electric and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath25 are related to velocity dispersion along the @xmath23 and @xmath26 directions , respectively    the fact that the moment equations following from the ( quantum ) wigner equation and the ( classical ) vlasov equation are the same seems to be a puzzle .",
    "some quantum contribution should survive , otherwise both classical and quantum dispersion relations would be the same .",
    "the key to solve the puzzle is hidden in the fourth - order moment term at ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "this term is neglected in the pure classical case , but in the following it is shown that this can not be taken from granted in the quantum case .",
    "to estimate the fourth - order moment term at ( [ e8 ] ) , one uses the linearized wigner equation to find @xmath27 where @xmath28 and the fifth - order moment @xmath29 was disregarded to get closure of the system . in ( [ e11 ] )",

    "equation ( [ e13 ] ) is the same as eq .",
    "( 22 ) of basu s work @xcite , but now with the extra quantum term proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "notice that the final result is independent of @xmath37 , a fact which is consistent with an extreme temperature anisotropy assumption ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "until now the treatment is completely general , with no particular assumption on the form of the equilibrium distribution function , as long as @xmath31 in ( [ e12 ] ) can be disregarded . in this sense ,",
    "the instability follows from temperature anisotropy , whatever the exact form of the equilibrium distribution function .",
    "nevertheless , in section iii it is shown that for extreme degenerate fermi gases one is obliged to fully keep the fourth - order moment contribution , including the term @xmath31 which would be not negligible anymore .",
    "this leads to a modified dispersion relation , useful for very dense plasmas like in astrophysical objects as white dwarfs and neutron stars as well as in laser - solid plasma interaction experiments .",
    "it can be said , that the quantum correction in the second term at the right - hand side of ( [ e11 ] ) is always present and that an additional quantum correction coming from extreme densities can also manifest through the term @xmath31 , fairly negligible for classical plasma .",
    "modifications arising from the dispersive term @xmath39 at ( [ e11 ] ) will be referred in the present context as ( quantum ) effects of the first kind , while the contribution from the @xmath31 integral will be called a perturbation of the second kind .    in order to compare the dispersion relation ( [ e13 ] ) to previous work on the quantum weibel instability , one can insert the extreme anisotropic equilibrium distribution function @xmath40\\ ] ] into the wigner - maxwell system as it is presented , for instance , in reference @xcite .",
    "after linearizing and fourier transforming , the result is @xmath41 = 0 \\,,\\ ] ] which is the same as ( [ e13 ] ) provided @xmath42 , in accordance with the long wave - length approximation .",
    "if one proceeds with ( [ e15 ] ) , one would also get the dispersion relation shown in eq .",
    "( 29 ) of reference @xcite .",
    "hence , the moment and the kinetic theory approaches gives the same results , provided there is sufficient temperature anisotropy and the long wave - length assumption is valid .",
    "it should be observed that quantum effects in plasma can be taken into account in at least two ways . on one hand , a quantum transport equation can be the starting point . in this work ,",
    "the rle of quantum transport equation is played by the linearized wigner equation ( [ e1 ] ) . unlike vlasov s equation , the wigner equation is able to model quantum phenomena like tunneling and wave - packet spreading . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum effects can be incorporated by means of an equilibrium distribution reflecting the spin of the charge carriers .",
    "this second avenue is pursued in this section , where radical departures to the dispersion relation are found , especially for strongly degenerate systems .    in the previous section , the quantity @xmath31 at ( [ e12 ] )",
    "was neglected and the dispersion relation ( [ e13 ] ) was obtained .",
    "the purpose of this section is to investigate more closely the assumption on the smallness of @xmath31 . in order to get closure of the moment equations",
    ", it is unavoidable to add some hypothesis on the equilibria . as will be shown",
    ", it is not generically true that @xmath31 can be neglected .",

    "the fermi statistics is unavoidable in the case of degenerate fermi gases , as intense laser beams or compact astrophysical objects .",
    "dilute systems ( @xmath51 ) are fairly well treated by the maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium .",
    "notice that ( [ e16 ] ) is not the more usual fermi - dirac distribution @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the appropriated wave vector in momentum space , but the associated equilibrium wigner function .",
    "these objects are related by @xmath54 , with the factor @xmath55 coming from spin @xcite .",
    "another distinctive feature is that here temperature anisotropy is allowed .    inserting ( [ e17 ] ) into ( [ e12 ] ) , the result is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is another polylogarithm function . in the particular case of dilute systems ,",
    "using the properties of the polylogarithm function , the last equation reduces to @xmath58 which is equivalent to eq .",

    "while ( [ e21 ] ) is automatically satisfied for dilute systems due to the long wave - length approximation , the same is not true for a strongly degenerate fermi gas .",
    "for instance , for @xmath62 , the right hand side of ( [ e21 ] ) is as large as @xmath63 , so that the contribution coming from quantum statistics can not be neglected at ( [ e20 ] ) .",
    "this modified dispersion relation can be useful for a better understanding of the weibel instability in very dense plasma systems .",
    "however , it is a macroscopic relation not so easily comparable to kinetic ( wigner - maxwell ) relations .",
    "this is the case , since the anisotropic fermi - dirac equilibrium ( [ e16 ] ) is not easily amenable to analytic results even for extreme temperature anisotropy .",
    "however , the analytical difficulties of the kinetic dispersion relation arising from ( [ e16 ] ) are just one reason more to emphasize the relevance of the macroscopic equation ( [ e20 ] ) .",
