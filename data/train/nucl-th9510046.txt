    "the calculation of the charge form factors @xmath4 of nuclei is a challenging and appealing problem @xcite . a possibility to face",
    "this problem is by means of an independent - particle model . in this approach , which is particularly attractive because of its simplicity",
    ", the choice of the single particle potential has to be suitably made .",
    "in fact a short range repulsion in this potential seems advisable for light nuclei ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , with an harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential having in addition an infinite soft core of the form @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) the @xmath4 of @xmath7 can be well reproduced , but for the heavier nuclei , such as @xmath8 and @xmath0 , state dependent potentials seem necessary and even then the fit is not so good for higher q - values @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the correction of the centre of mass motion can not be made exactly and unambiguously .",
    "an approach which is rather similar is the approach of ripka and gillespie @xcite and gaudin et al @xcite .",
    "it was shown by these authors that if a jastrow wave function consisting of ho orbitals and of simple state - independent correlation functions of the form @xmath9 is used , one can construct a slater determinant which yields a density `` very similar '' to that of such a jastrow wave function in the two - body approximation .",
    "this is done by diagonalizing the density matrix : @xmath10 that is by using the so - called `` natural orbitals '' .",
    "it is clear , however , that the actual density matrix is unknown and one obtains it approximately , usually by means of a jastrow wave function , as is the case in the above references ( see expression ( 7.7 ) of the paper by gaudin et al @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , even with such an approach one still has in practice to use a complicated wave function such as a jastrow one . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that a jastrow wave function is useful even if one is only interested in calculating the form factor and density distribution of nuclei and not necessarily other quantities , such as the momentum distribution @xcite .    in a series of papers @xcite an expression of the elastic charge form factor , @xmath4 , truncated at the two body term , was derived using the factor cluster expansion of ristig et al @xcite .",
    "this expression , which is a sum of one - body and two - body terms , depends on the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) parameter @xmath11 and the correlation parameter @xmath12 through a jastrow type correlation function which introduces the short range correlations ( src ) .",
    "the use of the @xmath13 orbitals ( as well as of the particular and popular form of the jastrow correlation function used ) stems mainly from the considerable simplification they imply .",
    "there are , however , additional advantages , such as : * i. * the correction of the centre of mass motion can be done exactly by means of the tassie and barker factor @xcite . *",
    "* one can obtain analytically the asymptotic behaviour of the form factor @xmath4 . in principle , of course , one should start with a hartree - fock independent - particle model assuming an effective interaction and then introduce correlations .",
    "such an approach is , however , computation - wise quite demanding .",
    "although it is more sophisticated and more satisfactory , it lacks the above mentioned two advantages .",
    "the fit of @xmath4 to the experimental data with the above mentioned procedure was very good both for low and high values of momentum transfer except for the values around the last maximum for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "better fit can be obtained if the parameter @xmath12 is taken to be state dependent but in this case there is a big number of parameters , six for @xmath0 @xcite and ten for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "another possible way to make the agreement between theory and experiment better might be to introduce , in addition , other types of ground state ( `` long range '' ) correlations which have been the subject of previous investigations by a number of authors ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we focus our attention , as in ref.@xcite , on fluctuations of nuclear surface due to the zero point motion of collective surface vibrations @xcite which can affect the ground state charge density . the presence of surface fluctuation correlations ( sfc ) introduce another fitting parameter in addition to the ho and the src parameters .",
    "thus , it appears to be of interest to  develop the relevant formalism and to investigate what would be the effect , if any , of this additional parameter to the best fit values of the other parameters and to the quality of the fit .",
    "the aim of this paper is to report on results of certain investigations towards this direction .    in section 2 ,",
    "the above sfc are introduced to the ho densities and analytic expressions of the nuclear density , elastic form factor and of the n - th moment of the density distribution are given for the nuclei @xmath16 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in section 3 the introduction of the sfc in addition to the src",
    "is studied .",
    "numerical results are reported and discussed in section 4 .",
    "our starting point is the expression for the proton ( or charge ) density of a nucleus which has been deformed through the zero - point motions of the collective surface vibrations .",
    "this expression , according to ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a rather similar expression ) is the following : @xmath17 d\\xi \\label{den - lrc}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the uncorrelated density , @xmath19 is a correction needed to conserve the number of particles in the correlated ground state and @xmath20 is a measure of the effect of the zero point fluctuations .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is related to @xmath22 , the deformation parameters for the states of multipolarity @xmath23 , with the relation @xmath24 while the @xmath22 parameters can be determined from the values of @xmath25 @xcite .    in ( [ den - lrc ] )",
    "we consider for @xmath18 the ho proton density , in which the centre of mass correction has been taken into account , for nuclei @xmath26 to @xmath1 .",

    "@xmath31 is the occupation probability ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 in the present treatment ) of the @xmath34 state .",
    "it is easily checked that when @xmath35 , that is when the centre of mass correction is not taken into account , the coefficients of the polynomial in [ den - ho ] are reduced to the well known expressions : @xmath36 general expressions of similar structure for the density and the form factor in the ho model have been given in ref @xcite .    from ( [ den - lrc ] ) and ( [ den - ho ] )",

    "more accurate values were obtained by varying @xmath46 until normalization of @xmath50 was achieved to a good approximation . from expressions ( [ r^n - approx ] ) and ( [ s0 ] ) and from the known expression of the moments of the ho density one can find the approximate expression of the contribution of the sfc , @xmath51 , to the mean square radius for nuclei @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",

    "furthermore , by using the asymptotic expansion of the confluent hypergeometric function , we find that the behaviour for @xmath56 at large values of the momentum transfer is the following : @xmath67 \\over { { \\tilde { b}}_1 ^ 2 \\sqrt{b } } } \\ , \\left ( a_4 \\,({q \\over { 2\\sqrt{b}}})^{-4 } \\,+ \\ , a_6 \\ , ( { q \\over { 2\\sqrt{b } } } ) ^{-6 } \\,+ \\ , a_8 \\,({q \\over { 2\\sqrt{b } } } ) ^{-8 } \\right ) \\label{f - asym}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 thus , it is seen that for sufficiently large values of @xmath3 , the form factor tends to zero rather slowly , namely as the inverse fourth power of the momentum transfer .",
    "on the contrary , the ho form factor goes rapidly to zero for large @xmath3 , namely as a gaussian or as a gaussian times an even power of @xmath3 ( depending on the nucleus ) .",
    "the value of @xmath3 at which the @xmath56 approaches the value given by the asymptotic expression ( [ f - asym ] ) does not seem to depend very strongly on the nucleus , at least when the values of the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath21 are determined in the way described in the following two sections . in fig .",
    "1 the @xmath56 has been plotted for the @xmath70 nucleus , using the values @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( see section 4 ) , together with its asymptotic behaviour @xmath2 and the improved asymptotic expression ( [ f - asym ] ) , respectively .",
    "it is seen that @xmath56 becomes close to the asymptotic behaviour @xmath73 at quite large values of the momentum transfer ( larger than @xmath74 ) while essential convergence to the behavior ( [ f - asym ] ) is achieved at much smaller @xmath3 values .",
    "it might also be of interest to note that people have assumed in the past @xcite a decrease of the form factor of the type @xmath75 in the region where no measurements are performed : @xmath76 ( measured ) , in order to obtain error envelopes on the densities of nuclei .",
    "the present analysis indicates that the inclusion of additional terms of the type mentioned above seems appropriate in this sort of analysis .",
    "there are two parameters in expression ( [ f(ho - lrc ) ] ) , the ho parameter @xmath69 and the sfc parameter @xmath21 which can be determined from the deformation parameters @xmath77 associated with the low lying collective states of the nucleus or can be treated for example as a free parameter . in the latter case , the fit of the form factor ( [ f(ho - lrc ) ] ) ( after correcting it for the finite proton size @xcite ) to the experimental data ( refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath52 , @xcite for @xmath78 and @xcite for @xmath79 ) leads to zero value for the parameter @xmath21 except for @xmath52 . for @xmath52",
    ", @xmath21 is different from zero ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) and the value of @xmath82 is smaller compared to the one obtained with the ho model .",
    "however , the diffraction minimum is not reproduced .",
    "because of these reasons the introduction of short range correlations is advisable .",
    "this is done in the next section .",
    "a general expression for the charge form factor @xmath4 of light closed shell nuclei was derived @xcite using the factor cluster expansion of ristig , ter low and clark @xcite .",
    "this formula was further simplified by using normalized correlated wave functions of the relative motion which were  parameterized through a jastrow type relative two - body wave function of the form : @xmath83 \\phi_{nl}(r ) \\label{jastrow wf}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 are the normalization factors , @xmath85 the harmonic oscillator wave functions and @xmath86 is the ho parameter for the relative motion .",
    "the expression for @xmath87 is of the form @xmath88 @xmath89 is the contribution of the one - body term to @xmath87 : @xmath90 }   \\sum_{k=0}^{2 } \\tilde{n}_{2k } ( { { b_{1 } q } \\over 2 } ) ^{2k } \\label{f - ho}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 while @xmath92 is the contribution of the two - body term to @xmath87 and is a function of @xmath93 through the matrix elements @xmath94 it consists of simple polynomials and exponential functions of @xmath95",
    ".    the point proton density can be obtained from ( [ f - src ] ) by fourier transforming @xmath87 .",
    "the density is also separated into two parts : @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the fourier transforms of @xmath89 and @xmath92 ,  respectively .",
    "@xmath97 is given by expression ( [ den - ho ] ) ( with @xmath99 ) while @xmath98 is calculated numerically because of the complexity of @xmath92 mainly for @xmath1 .",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath12 and the ho parameter @xmath11 were determined by fitting @xmath100 to the experimental charge form factor .",
    "@xmath101 $ ] are the corrections due to the finite proton size @xcite and the centre of mass motion @xcite , respectively .",
    "as it was pointed out in the introduction , a possible way of improving the quality of the fit in the approach outlined previously , should be to take into account the correlations originating from the fluctuation of the nuclear surface .",
    "thus in ( [ den - src ] ) , @xmath18 is substituted by @xmath37 , while @xmath98 by @xmath102 , which results by using in expression ( [ den - lrc ] ) instead of @xmath18 the fourier transform of @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , instead of @xmath104 given by ( [ den - src ] ) we have now @xmath105 : @xmath106 the ( total ) point - proton form factor @xmath107 is then obtained by summing the fourier transforms of @xmath37 , @xmath108 and of @xmath109 , that is : @xmath110    it should be noted that because of the assumed form of the correlation function the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath107 for large @xmath3 is expected to be of the same functional form as that of @xmath56 .",
    "the coefficients , however , in the various even negative power terms of @xmath3 will be different .",
    "thus , the introduction of the sfc effects in the correlated ( through jastrow correlations ) , h.o .",
    "wave function leads to less steep decrease of @xmath107 at large @xmath3 .",
    "it might be of interest to point out that a slow  decrease of the form factor at large @xmath3 is also suggested from our numerical results .",
    "finally , the charge form factor is obtained by multiplying @xmath107 by the charge form factor of the proton , @xmath111 : @xmath112    expression ( [ ftot - ch ] ) was used in fitting to the experimental values of the charge form factor , by treating @xmath113 , and @xmath21 as fitting parameters .",
    "the best fit values of the three parameters in the form factor , as well as the values of @xmath114 , for the nuclei @xmath115 and @xmath116 are displayed in * table 1 * where three cases are considered . in",
    "* case 1 * there are no correlations of any kind while in * case 2 * the src are included .",
    "these two cases have been studied in previous works @xcite . finally , in * case 3",
    "* , both the sfc and src are included . in the case of @xmath16 the best fit value of the parameter @xmath21 goes to zero in the least - squares fitting procedure .",
    "therefore , the present approach does not seem to be  applicable to this nucleus .",
    "the value @xmath117 for @xmath1 may be compared with the value @xmath118 which is given in @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the value of @xmath21 is considerably smaller in the present approach in comparison to that of ref .",
    "an analogous remark holds for the value of this parameter for @xmath0 , if  comparison is made with the value obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is further noted that the value of @xmath21 for @xmath0 is larger than that of @xmath1 .",
    "this is in accordance with what one expects on the basis of the variation of @xmath119 with the mass number , which was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and is further elaborated in the appendix of the present paper .",
    "we also observe that if the parameter @xmath120 ( see expression ( [ a-1 ] ) ) is determined from our value of @xmath21 for @xmath0 , the value of @xmath21 we find for @xmath53 is not far from the value predicted on the basis of expression ( [ a-7 ] ) .",
    "it is smaller than that value by less than @xmath121 .",
    "we observe also from table 1 that for @xmath78 and @xmath53 , the introduction of the sfc and the src decreases the values of parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 while the value of @xmath122 ( which is the `` actual correlation parameter '' , since small values of @xmath122 imply values of the correlation factors closer to unity ) is increased . that would deteriorate the convergence of the cluster expansion .",
    "this is indicated by the values of the so - called `` healing '' or `` wound '' integrals ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the various states : @xmath123    it is expected that , the larger the value of @xmath124 the worse the convergence of the cluster expansion of the density . with the correlated relative , two - body wave function ( [ jastrow wf ] ) ,",
    "the healing integral is given simply by @xmath125 \\label{eta-2}\\ ] ] where the normalization factors @xmath126 and the integrals @xmath127 can be  obtained analytically for the various states . for the lowest state ,",
    "its  expression is fairly simple : @xmath128 \\left [ 1 - 2(1+\\lambda)^{-3/2 } + ( 1 + 2 \\lambda)^{-3/2 } \\right ] ^{-1/2 } \\right\\ } \\label{eta-3}\\ ] ] and can be easily used for calculations .",
    "we have dropped the index @xmath129 , since we consider state - independent correlation functions . for @xmath78 , in case 2 we find @xmath130 while in case 3 , @xmath131 , indicating deterioration of the convergence of the cluster expansion .",
    "similar are the results for the higher states ( e.g. for the @xmath132 state we have in case 2 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 in case 3 ) .",
    "analogous are the results for @xmath79 . in this case , however , the increase of the values of @xmath135 is smaller in comparison with the corresponding one for @xmath78 , indicating milder deterioration of the convergence of the cluster expansion .",
    "it is clear regarding the results of case 3 in table 1 that the sfc effects on both , the one - body and the two - body part of the cluster expansion of the form factor have been taken into account .",
    "quite a simpler approach would be to take into account these effects only on the one - body part .",
    "such an approach , however , would not be appropriate since then both terms would not be treated on the same footing .",
    "it might have been acceptable if the effect of the sfc on the two - body part had been sufficiently small , which unfortunately does not appear to be the case .",
    "this is indicated by the change in the best - fit values of the parameters . if the sfc effects are taken into account only for the one - body part of the form factor , then the best fit values for @xmath0 are : @xmath136 and for @xmath1 : @xmath137 .",
    "it is seen that there is a noticable change in the values of these parameters .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath21 for @xmath0 is smaller than the value of @xmath21 for @xmath1 , which contradicts our expectations ( see appendix ) .    for the two nuclei we have considered , the introduction of the sfc has the effect of improving the fit of @xmath4 to the experimental data .",
    "although the introduction of sfc does not decrease the value of @xmath138 too much , its relative decrease for @xmath78 being larger than that of @xmath79 , there is an improvement of the fit in the region of the large @xmath3-values .",
    "this can be seen in figures 2a and 3a where the @xmath4 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been plotted with the best fit values of the parameters and compared with the experimental @xmath4 .",
    "another interesting  observation one can make regarding these figures is the slow decrease of @xmath4 at large @xmath3 in case 3 ( in which the src and sfc are included in the form factor ) , in comparison with cases 1 and 2 .",
    "it seems also appropriate to point out that the putative roles of the mean - field , short range correlations and surface - fluctuation effects get mixed up to some degree .",
    "thus , ( see table 1 ) the introduction of src changes the value of the ho parameter and the additional introduction of sfc not only does it change further this value but also the value of the parameter determing the short range correlations .",
    "furthermore , the sfc effects which should predominantly influence the low and medium @xmath3 behaviour of the form factor produce a substantial change in its values and its functional behavior at very large values of the momentum transfer .",
    "one could perhaps say that the introduction of the sfc `` relieves the burden '' assumed by the src ( in the two - body approximation ) in correcting the independent particle model , so that they can better perform the function for which they were designed .    in figures 2b and",
    "3b the ( corresponding to @xmath4 ) charge densities @xmath139 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been plotted . in the same figures certain other relevant quantities",
    "have also been plotted ,  namely :    * @xmath140 . * the two - body part of the density @xmath141 corrected for the finite proton size : @xmath142 without sfc .",
    "the dashed line @xmath142 was obtained with the parameters of case 2 and the solid line @xmath142 was obtained with the parameters of case 3 .",
    "it is seen that if the two - body part of the cluster expansion of the charge density with the jastrow correlation function and ho orbitals is calculated with the parameters of case 3 , its absolute values for various @xmath143 increase rather considerably ( see solid line ) in comparison with its absolute values calculated with the parameters of case 2 .",
    "* @xmath144 . * the  difference of the charge densities @xmath145 , that is the difference between the ( ho+src ) charge densities with and without sfc , calculated with the parameters of case 3 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath146 is quite small and characterized by oscillations .    in summary",
    ", the present analysis suggests that the inclusion of the correlations originating from the fluctuations of the nuclear surface in the usual cluster expansion ( truncated at the two - body part ) of the charge form factor of @xmath0 and @xmath1 leads to some improvement in the quality of the fit to the experimental data .",
    "it is also found that the convergence of the cluster expansion is expected to deteriorate .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of these correlations has a drastic effect on the asymptotic behaviour of the point - proton form factor , which now falls off for large @xmath3 quite slowly , that is as @xmath147 .",

    "f. barranco for useful correspondence .",
    "this work is part of a research program supported by the general secretariat of  research and technology , through contract pened no 360/91 .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the variation of the parameter @xmath148 with the mass number @xmath149 on the basis of a phenomenological analysis .",
    "we assume that @xmath148 is proportional to the ratio : _ ( surface of the nucleus)/(volume of the nucleus)_. this is suggested by the results and discussion of ref .",
