    "optical spectra serve as the basis for the classification of supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "this chapter is concerned with extracting information from optical spectra on the geometry , physical conditions , and composition structure ( element composition versus ejection velocity ) of the ejected matter , and also the circumstellar matter for some sne .",
    "several other chapters of this volume also discuss certain aspects of sn spectroscopy : ultraviolet spectra ( chap .  7 by n.  panagia ) ; the circumstellar and nebular spectra of sn  1987a ( chap .  15 by r.  mccray ) ; and the hypernova sn  1998bw ( chap .  25 by k.  iwamoto et  al . ) .    some of the information carried by sn spectra can be inferred directly from the observed line profiles and fluxes , but because sn ejection velocities are a few percent of the speed of light , spectral features generally are blended and interpretation often involves comparing observed spectra with synthetic spectra calculated for model sne .",
    "the spectrum calculations may be simplified and rapid , or physically self - consistent and computationally intensive .",
    "similarly , both simple parameterized physical models and numerical hydrodynamical models are used . in this chapter",
    "we place some emphasis on recent results obtained with the help of synthetic spectra .    in  2",
    "the elements of spectral line formation in sne are discussed and some of the synthetic spectrum codes that are in current use are described . in  ",
    "36 recent comparisons of synthetic spectra with observed spectra of sne of types ia , ib , ic , and ii are surveyed .",
    "space limitations prevent us from referring to the numerous papers that have been important to the development of this subject ; many such can be found in 1993 and 1997 review articles @xcite .",
    "here most of the references are to , and all of the figures are from , papers that have appeared since 1998 . a brief discussion of the prospects for the future appears in  7 .",
    "at the time of the supernova explosion , physical scales are relatively small .",
    "shortly thereafter the ejected matter expands freely as from a point explosion with each matter element having a constant velocity . all structures in the ejecta",
    "then just scale linearly with @xmath0 , the time since explosion .",
    "the matter is in homologous expansion , which has several convenient features : ( 1 )  the radial velocity @xmath1 of a matter element is a useful comoving coordinate with actual radial position of the element given by @xmath2 ; ( 2 )  the density at any comoving point just scales as @xmath3 ; ( 3 )  the photon redshift between matter elements separated by velocity @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is time - independent ; and ( 4 )  the resonance surfaces for line emission at a single doppler - shifted line frequency are just planes perpendicular to the observer s line of sight .",
    "( relativistic effects introduce a slight curvature @xcite . )",
    "if continuous opacity in the line forming region is disregarded , the profile of an unblended line can be calculated when the line optical depth @xmath6 and source function @xmath7 are specified . because sn ejection velocities ( @xmath8 km  s@xmath9 ) are much larger than the random thermal velocities ( @xmath10 km  s@xmath9 ) , a photon remains in resonance with an atomic transition only within a small resonance region .",
    "the sobolev approximation , that the physical conditions other than the velocity are uniform within the resonance region , usually is a good one , and it allows the optical depth of a line to be simply expressed in terms of the local number densities of atoms or ions in the lower and upper levels of the transition :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the oscillator strength , @xmath13 is the line wavelength in microns , @xmath14 is the time since explosion in days , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the populations of the lower and upper levels of the transition in @xmath17 .",
    "the term in brackets is the correction for stimulated emission .",
    "the source function is    @xmath18    all of the radial dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 is in the level populations .",
    "the specific intensity that emerges from a resonance region is    @xmath21    spectroscopic evolution can be divided into a photospheric phase when the sn is optically thick in the continuum below a photospheric velocity , and a subsequent nebular phase during which the whole sn is optically thin in the continuum . in the photospheric phase line formation occurs above the photosphere and in the nebular phase throughout the ejecta .",
    "there is , of course , no sharp division between the two phases .",
    "however , spectral synthesis modeling techniques in the photospheric and nebular limits can make use of different approximations which are adequate for those limits .    in the remainder of this section we first discuss line formation and synthetic spectrum codes in the photospheric and nebular phases under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and negligible circumstellar interaction .",
    "we then consider the effects of circumstellar interaction , and sn asymmetry and polarization spectra .",
    "the elements of spectrum formation in the photospheric phase have been discussed and illustrated at length elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we will only briefly summarize those elements and then discuss spectrum synthesis codes .    during the photospheric phase a continuum radiation field is emitted by a photosphere which can be idealized as an infinitely thin layer . above the photosphere",
    "the radiation interaction with continuous opacity is small .",
    "line opacity on the other hand can be very large for the strongest lines .",
    "the large doppler shifts spread line opacity over a large wavelength interval increasing the effect of strong lines compared to a static atmosphere where such strong lines saturate and can only affect radiation in a narrow wavelength interval .",
    "the cumulative effect of many lines , strong and weak , can create a quasi - continuous opacity in the eulerian frame .",
    "this effect has been called the `` expansion opacity '' @xcite ; it dominates in the ultraviolet , where it effectively pushes the photosphere out to a larger radius than in the optical .",
    "full , co - moving , line - blanketed calculations automatically account for this effect @xcite ; introducing the observer s frame expansion opacity into comoving frame calculations is incorrect .    in the optical , which is usually the chief focus of analysis ,",
    "the spectrum is characterized by p  cygni lines superimposed on the photospheric continuum .",
    "the p  cygni profile has an emission peak near the rest wavelength of the line and a blueshifted absorption feature .",
    "the peak may be formed in part by true emission or by line scattering into the line of sight of photons emitted by the photosphere .",
    "the emission peak would tend to be symmetrical about the line center wavelength if not for the blueshifted absorption .",
    "the absorption is formed by scattering out of the line of sight of photospheric photons emitted toward the observer .",
    "since this occurs in front of the photosphere , the absorption is blueshifted .",
    "at early times the ejecta density is high , the photosphere is at high velocity , and the line opacity is strong out to still higher velocities . as expansion proceeds ,",
    "the photosphere and the region of line formation recede deeper into the ejecta .",
    "the p  cygni line profile width thus decreases with time .",
    "the minimum of the absorption feature of weak lines tends to form near the photospheric velocity , thus weak lines ( e.g. , weak fe  ii lines ) can be used to determine the photospheric velocity s time evolution .",
    "the recession of the photosphere exposes the inner ejecta and permits its analysis .    in understanding p",
    "cygni line formation in sne it is conceptually useful , and often in simple parameterized radiative transfer modeling a good physical approximation , to consider the line - photon interaction as being pure resonance scattering ; i.e. , no photon creation or destruction above the photosphere",
    ". then the source function of an unblended line is just @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the usual geometrical dilution factor",
    "@xcite and @xmath24 is the continuum specific intensity ( assumed angle - independent ) radiated by the photosphere .",
    "given the pure resonance scattering approximation for an unblended p  cygni line , the emission is formed just by scattering into the line of sight and the absorption just by scattering out of the line of sight .",
    "unfortunately , in general there is strong line blending .",
    "a photon that is scattered by one transition can redshift into resonance with another , so the influence of each transition on others of longer wavelength must be taken into account .",
    "this multiple scattering corresponds to the observer s line blending .",
    "calculations show that in blends , absorptions trump emissions : i.e. , when resolved , the absorption minima of blends tend to be blueshifted by their usual amounts , but the emission peaks do not necessarily correspond to the rest wavelengths of the lines of the blend .",
    "thus absorption minima usually are more useful than emission peaks for making line identifications during the photospheric phase .",
    "if one has made the resonance scattering approximation for simple modeling , it turns out that the effect of line blending on source functions for some lines is often effectively very small . from a conceptual point of view",
    "it is convenient to think of @xmath25 even for strongly blended lines . in general",
    "the effect of line blending on the emergent spectrum is significant and can not be neglected .",
    "km  s@xmath9  and hydrogen lines detached at 20,000 km  s@xmath9where @xmath26(h@xmath27)=2 , is compared with a synthetic spectrum ( _ solid line _ ) that has @xmath28 km  s@xmath9  and undetached hydrogen lines with @xmath26(h@xmath27 ) = 10 at the photosphere .",
    "( from @xcite)[fig : detach ] ]    a special case of a p  cygni line that has become of interest is a `` detached '' line : i.e , a line that has a significant optical depth only above some detachment velocity that exceeds the velocity at the photosphere . a detached line",
    "consists of a flat inconspicuous emission peak and an absorption having a sharp red edge at the blueshift corresponding to the detachment velocity ( fig  1 ) .",
    "we shall later refer to the concept of detached lines in discussing particular observed spectra .",
    "it is possible to extract some information from spectra by simple direct analysis . recently",
    "a method for inverting an unblended p  cygni line profile to extract the radial dependences of the line optical depth and the source function has been developed @xcite .",
    "but the complex blending of p  cygni lines ( which often occurs ) , and the need to account for effects that can not treated by direct approaches make analysis by synthetic spectrum modeling essential . rather than discuss modeling in general we will briefly describe three synthetic spectrum codes that are frequently used , proceeding from simple to complex .",
    "example synthetic spectra from these codes will appear in ",
    " 3  6 .",
    "the simplest code is the fast , parameterized ` synow ` code .",
    "technical details of the current version are in @xcite .",
    "the basic assumptions are : spherical symmetry ; a sharp photosphere that emits a blackbody continuous spectrum ; and the sobolev approximation with a resonance scattering source function . `",
    "synow ` does not do continuum transport , it does not solve rate equations , and it does not calculate or assume ionization ratios .",
    "its main function is to take line multiple scattering into account so that it can be used in an empirical spirit to make line identifications and determine the velocity at the photosphere and the velocity intervals within which the presence of each ion is detected . for each ion that is introduced ,",
    "the optical depth at the photosphere of a reference line is a free parameter , and the optical depths of the other lines of the ion are calculated assuming boltzmann excitation .",
    "reference lines are generally chosen as the strongest line in the optical for a particular species .",
    "line optical depths are assumed to decrease radially following a power law or an exponential . when deciding which ions to introduce",
    ", use is made of the results of @xcite who presented plots of lte sobolev line optical depths versus temperature for six different compositions that might be expected to be encountered in sne , and sample ` synow ` optical spectra for 45 individual ions that are candidates for producing identifiable spectral features in sne .",
    "when fitting to an observed spectrum , the important parameters are the reference line optical depths , the velocity at the photosphere , and whatever maximum and minimum ( detachment ) velocities may be imposed on each ion .",
    "somewhat more complex synthetic spectrum calculations are carried out with what we will refer to as the ` ml monte carlo ` code ( ml for mazzali and lucy ) , technical details of which are in @xcite and references therein .",
    "this code also assumes a sharp photosphere , makes the sobolev approximation , and does not solve rate equations .",
    "the main differences from ` synow ` are : ( 1 ) an approximate radiative equilibrium temperature distribution and internally consistent ionization ratios are calculated for an assumed composition structure ; ( 2 ) electron scattering in the atmosphere is taken into account ; and ( 3 ) the original assumption of resonance scattering has been replaced by an approximate treatment of photon branching , to allow an absorption in one transition to be followed by emission in another @xcite .",
    "several circumstances in which the effects of photon branching are significant are discussed in @xcite .",
    "very detailed calculations are made with the multi - purpose synthetic spectrum and model atmosphere code called ` phoenix ` .",
    "technical details of ` phoenix ` are in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the basic assumptions are spherical symmetry and time independence .",
    "the sobolev approximation is dispensed with , and calculations are carried out in the comoving frame with all special relativistic effects .",
    "the aim of ` phoenix ` is to take all of the relevant physics into account as fully as possible .",
    "` phoenix ` treats continuum transport , solves the nlte rate equations for a large number of ions and a very large number of atomic levels with gamma ray deposition and nonthermal excitation taken into account , and determines a self - consistent radiative equilibrium temperature structure .",
    "the lower boundary condition can be chosen to be either diffusive or nebular .",
    "one may ask why simpler codes are needed when ` phoenix`-like codes can be implemented . `",
    "phoenix`like codes demand many hours of computation and are not optimal for explorations of parameter space or for gaining insight into how simple features of modeling affect outcomes .",
    "the simpler codes are tools for rapid exploration and gaining insight .",
    "such codes , however , can not give definitive determinations because of their simplified physics . ` phoenix`like calculations must be the basis for ultimate decisions about the viability of sn models .      our discussion of line formation in the nebular phase will be brief since the subject is discussed in chap .  15 , in the context of sn  1987a .",
    "( see also @xcite . )    in the absence of circumstellar interaction , the nebular phase is powered by radioactive decay , primarily @xmath29co ( 77.23  day half - life ) , the daughter of explosion - synthesized @xmath29ni ( 6.075  day half - life ) . at very late times",
    "longer lived radioactive species such as @xmath30co and @xmath31ti become important .",
    "the decay gamma  rays deposit their energy by compton scattering off electrons to produce nonthermal fast electrons whose energy quickly goes into atomic ionization and excitation , and coulomb heating of the thermal electrons @xcite .",
    "particularly for low mass sne ( types  ia , b , c ) the unscattered escape of gamma  rays ( which increases as the ejecta thins ) causes the kinetic energy of positrons from the @xmath29co decays to become an important energy source : about @xmath32% of the @xmath29co decay energy is in the form of positron kinetic energy .",
    "the positrons are much more strongly trapped than the gamma rays  but not completely trapped @xcite .",
    "the positron kinetic energy goes into creating fast electrons leading to the same deposition processes as the gamma  rays .",
    "optical emission lines are formed by recombination , collisional excitation , and fluorescence .",
    "p  cygni profiles of permitted lines that form by scattering in the outer layers may be superimposed on the emission line spectrum .",
    "because of low continuous opacity and increasingly low line opacities , photons emitted by true emission processes are increasingly unlikely to be scattered again .",
    "thus non - local radiative transfer effects in the nebular phase tend to become negligible .",
    "( local trapping in an optical thick line can be treated easily using a sobolev escape probability . ) thus ( absent circumstellar interaction ) it is somewhat more feasible than in the photospheric phase to extract information without making synthetic spectrum calculations .",
    "this was especially true of sn  1987a , which because of its proximity was well observed in the optical and the infrared long into the nebular phase when the characteristic velocity of the line forming region was only @xmath33 km  s@xmath9  and blending was not too severe ( see chap .",
    "most other non - circumstellar interacting sne are observed only for a year or so after explosion and line blending is more of a problem .    without a photosphere ,",
    "there is no continuum flux to be scattered out of the line of sight even if there are optically thick lines .",
    "hence the characteristic line profile of the nebular phase is not a p  cygni profile , but an emission line that peaks near the rest wavelength and for several reasons may have an extended red wing @xcite .",
    "if the line has significant optical depth down to low velocity , the emission line has a rounded peak . if instead the line forms in a shell , the emission has a boxy ( flat top ) shape with the half width of the box corresponding to the minimum velocity of the shell .    as for the photospheric phase , nebular - phase synthetic spectrum calculations of various levels of complexity prove to be useful .",
    "relatively simple parameterized approaches that can be used as diagnostic tools are described by @xcite .",
    "a one - zone code that was developed in its original form by @xcite and will be referred to here as the ` rl nebular ` code ( rl for ruiz - lapuente and lucy ) is frequently used ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the input parameters are the time since explosion and the mass , composition , and outer velocity of the nebula .",
    "heating is calculated from the @xmath29co decay rate , and cooling is by radiative emission .",
    "the electron density , temperature , nlte level populations and emission line fluxes are determined simultaneously by enforcing statistical and thermal equilibrium .",
    "codes for calculating synthetic spectra of hydrodynamical models are described by @xcite and @xcite and references therein .",
    "these multi - zone codes calculate the nonthermal heating , ionization equilibrium , and the nlte level populations for a large number of atomic levels .",
    "synthetic spectra of the co molecule have also been calculated @xcite . for a description of additional nebular phase codes that have been used for sn  1987a ,",
    "see chap .  15 .",
    "the photospheric phase forbids a direct view into the inner regions of the ejecta .",
    "the nebular phase permits this direct view , but , on the other hand , the outer layers tend toward invisibility .",
    "the photospheric phase demands a powerful radiative transfer technique .",
    "the advanced nebular phase requires almost none at all , at least in the optical ; the ionizing photons in the uv may need a detailed radiative transfer treatment and , of course , the gamma ray and positron energy depositions need a non - local transfer treatment probably best done by monte carlo .",
    "both phases require nlte treatments and extensive atomic data .",
    "the two phases offer complementary insights and challenges for analysis .",
    "the physics of the radiative and hydrodynamical interactions between sne and their circumstellar matter ( circumstellar interaction : csi ) are discussed in chap .",
    "14 by r.a .",
    "chevalier & c.  fransson .",
    "no convincing detection of sn  ia csi has yet been made in any wavelength band .",
    "csi also does not seem to affect the optical spectra of typical sne  ib , sne  ic ( but for an exception see @xcite ) , and many sne  ii .",
    "some sne  ii and perhaps some hyperenergetic sne  ic are affected , and in extreme cases dominated , by csi effects .    in the idealized case , the wind of the sn progenitor star has a constant velocity and a constant mass loss rate , and therefore an @xmath34 density distribution .",
    "after the explosion , the circumstellar matter can be heated and accelerated by the photons emitted by the sn .",
    "subsequent hydrodynamic interaction between high velocity sn ejecta and low velocity circumstellar matter generates photon emission that further affects the velocity distribution and the ionization and excitation of both the circumstellar matter and the sn ejecta .",
    "these interactions can produce a rich array of effects on the optical spectra . during the photospheric phase narrow emission , absorption , and p  cygni lines formed in low velocity circumstellar matter may be superimposed on the sn spectrum @xcite .",
    "the sn resonance scattering features may be `` muted '' by the external illumination of the sn line forming region @xcite . in extreme cases",
    "the circumstellar matter may be optically thick in the continuum so that the spectrum consists only of circumstellar features , perhaps including broad wings produced by multiple scattering off circumstellar electrons @xcite . during",
    "the nebular phase csi can power boxy emission from high velocity sn matter @xcite and at very late times , even decades , csi can allow the detection of sne that would otherwise be unobservably faint @xcite .    because the simple @xmath2 velocity law does not apply to circumstellar matter , and blending of circumstellar lines generally is not as severe as it is for sn lines ( and spherical symmetry often is not an adequate approximation for circumstellar matter ) , few calculations of synthetic spectra for csi have been carried out so far .",
    "line profiles for various velocity and density distributions have been calculated @xcite and some ` phoenix ` calculations for a constant velocity circumstellar shell have been carried out @xcite .",
    "most of the analysis of optical csi features has involved extracting information on velocities directly from individual line profiles , and on physical conditions and abundances from emission line fluxes @xcite .",
    "it has been the heuristic and hopeful assumption that sne are essentially spherically symmetric .",
    "but from sn polarimetry , especially spectropolarimetry , it is now clear that all types of sne other than sne  ia usually do exhibit some kind of significant asymmetry ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization of sn flux in most cases arises from their atmospheres where continuous opacity is dominated by electron scattering in the optical and near infrared .",
    "electron scattering is polarizing with polarization ( for incident unpolarized radiation ) varying from @xmath35% for @xmath36 scattering to @xmath37% for forward and backward scattering according to the rayleigh phase matrix @xcite .",
    "the polarization position angle is perpendicular to the scattering plane defined by incident and scattered light .",
    "the emergent flux from a deep electron scattering atmosphere ( either plane - parallel or geometrically extended ) tends to exhibit a position angle aligned perpendicular to the normal to the surface and polarization increasing monotonically from @xmath37% at an emission angle of @xmath38 ( to the normal ) to a maximum at an emission angle of @xmath36 .",
    "for the plane - parallel case the maximum is only @xmath39% @xcite , but for a highly extended atmosphere it can approach @xmath35% @xcite from the limb , if it can be resolved .",
    "sn atmospheres fall into the extended class , and so beams from their limb should be highly polarized though mostly not at @xmath35% .",
    "beams from the photodisk region ( the projection of the photosphere on the sky ) should be much less polarized .",
    "if sne were spherically symmetric , the integrated flux ( which is all that can be observed from extragalactic sne ) would have zero polarization since all polarization alignments would contribute equally and thus cancel producing zero net polarization .",
    "because of cancellation , the predicted net continuum polarizations are low ( a few percent : see below ) even for quite strong asymmetries .",
    "line scattering is usually depolarizing @xcite .",
    "the simplest line polarization profile is an inverted p  cygni profile that is common although not universal in the sn  1987a data @xcite and is seen in some of the later spectropolarimetry @xcite . in this profile",
    "a polarization maximum is associated with the p  cygni absorption feature of the flux spectrum and a polarization minimum is associated with the p  cygni flux emission feature .",
    "the inverted p  cygni profile has a natural explanation . the polarized flux at any wavelength tends to come from @xmath36 electron scattering .",
    "at the flux absorption , unpolarized flux directly from the photosphere is scattered out of the line of sight by a line : thus , the electron polarized flux is less diluted and a polarization maximum arises . at the flux emission ,",
    "the line scatters into the line of sight extra unpolarized flux diluting the polarization due to the electron scattered flux .",
    "almost any shape asymmetry should tend to give the inverted polarization p  cygni profile .",
    "thus , the inverted p  cygni profile is somewhat limited as a direct analysis tool for asymmetry .",
    "although one must be cautious in generalizing because of the paucity and inhomogeneity of published data , it seems that most core - collapse sne that have been observed well enough to detect polarization of order a few tenths of percent ( of order 40 to date ) have shown at least that much continuum polarization .",
    "some of this can be interstellar polarization ( isp ) due to intervening dust , but intrinsic polarization seems to be present in many cases .",
    "the intrinsic polarization reveals itself through time dependence and , in spectropolarimetry , by line polarization features or by deviation from the isp wavelength dependence @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , correcting for parent  galaxy isp can only be done from an analysis of the sn data itself because there is no other bright nearby point source .",
    "even the galactic isp correction may often have to be determined using the sn data since isp can vary rapidly with position and depth and there may be no suitable galactic star near the angular position of the sn .",
    "techniques for correcting for isp have been developed @xcite .",
    "2 shows a sample of spectropolarimetry from a range of sn types overlapping the corresponding relative flux spectra .",
    "the polarization has been corrected for isp , but in most cases only with the intention of highlighting the line polarization features : the overall polarization level is not trustworthy .",
    "some of the line polarization features are consistent with the inverted p  cygni profile . however , line polarization features are badly distorted by isp , and thus reliable isp corrections are needed to determine the true line polarization profiles as well as the true continuum polarization .        for core - collapse sne",
    "the intrinsic continuum polarization varies from probably @xmath40% up to perhaps @xmath41% @xcite : a representative value would be @xmath42%",
    ". there may be a class of core - collapse sne ( those with massive hydrogen envelopes ) that have nearly zero polarization at early times @xcite , and so are highly spherical .",
    "apparent trends are that polarization increases with decreasing envelope mass ( i.e. , sne  ii - p least polarized , sne  ic most ) , and that polarization increases with time until the electron optical depth becomes small @xcite .",
    "the position angle of polarization tends to be nearly constant in time and wavelength @xcite , which is naturally accounted for by axisymmetry in the ejecta .    for sne  ia most observations ( of order 15 to date )",
    "have only been able to place an upper limit of about @xmath43% continuum polarization ( not distinguishing intrinsic from isp in most cases ) @xcite .",
    "one normal event , sn  1996x , has a marginal detection of intrinsic polarization of @xmath44% @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry of sn  1997dt also may show the signatures of intrinsic polarization ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "so far it seems that normal sne  ia are not very polarized and are quite spherically symmetric : this is consistent with the observational homogeneity that makes them such useful tools for cosmology . on the other hand ,",
    "the subluminous sn  1991bg - like event sn  1999by had intrinsic continuum polarization reaching up to perhaps @xmath45% @xcite .",
    "based on a sample of one , subluminous sne  ia may be significantly asymmetric .",
    "various models of asymmetry have been presented to interpret the polarization data .",
    "the conventional model is axisymmetric ellipsoidal asymmetry , either prolate or oblate @xcite .",
    "even when viewed equator - on , considerable ellipsoidal asymmetry is required to account for sn - like continuum polarization . for example , monte carlo calculations suggest that iso - density contour axis ratios of order 1.2:1 and 2.5:1 are needed for polarizations of @xmath42% and @xmath32% , respectively @xcite .",
    "late - time imaging of sn  1987a shows asymmetries suggesting axis ratios of 2:1 @xcite .",
    "thus large organized asymmetries something like the ellipsoidal models may account for most sn polarization .",
    "other suggested models of polarizing large  scale asymmetry are asymmetric clumpy ionization @xcite , or scattering of sn light off a nearby dust cloud @xcite or off bipolar jets @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry plays an extremely important role in polarimetric observations for two reasons : ( 1 ) it is very useful for establishing intrinsic polarization and correcting for isp , and ( 2 ) it is probably vital for understanding the sn asymmetry .",
    "currently the most advanced synthetic polarization spectrum analyses are done with a 3-dimensional ( 3d ) nlte code that uses monte carlo radiative transfer in the outer region where emergent polarization is formed @xcite . the nlte component of these calculations is necessarily more limited than in 1d calculations since 3d radiative transfer calculations are computationally very demanding .",
    "the ellipsoidal asymmetry used in the calculations of @xcite is parameterized and then fitted to the flux and polarization observations .",
    "explosion model asymmetries can also be used @xcite . because of the large parameter space to explore in investigating sn asymmetry , less elaborate codes than that of @xcite and @xcite will also continue to be useful .",
    "such codes will mostly rely on monte carlo radiative transfer because of its flexibility and robustness .",
    "in addition to the shape asymmetries discussed above , the ejected matter also may be `` clumped '' ( see chap .",
    "both observation and theory indicate that macroscopic ( not microscopic ) mixing is ubiquitous in sne .",
    "clumping is difficult to detect via polarization ( although see @xcite ) , but it can affect both the photospheric @xcite and nebular @xcite flux spectra . a version of ` synow ` for calculating flux spectra with clumps ( `",
    "clumpysyn ` ) has been developed for analysis of the photospheric phase @xcite .",
    "circumstellar matter may , and probably often does , have both global asymmetry and clumping @xcite .",
    "sne  ia are thought to be thermonuclear disruptions of accreting or merging white dwarfs .",
    "they can be separated on the basis of their photospheric spectra into those that are normal and those that are peculiar .",
    "normals such as the recently well observed sne  1996x @xcite and 1998bu @xcite have p  cygni features due to si  ii , ca  ii , s  ii , o  i , and mg  ii around the time of maximum brightness , and develop strong fe  ii features soon after maximum .",
    "peculiar , weak sn  1991bg  like events such as sne  1998de @xcite , 1997cn @xcite , and 1999by @xcite have , in addition , conspicuous low excitation ti  ii features .",
    "peculiar powerful sn  1991t  like events such as sne  1997br @xcite and 2000cx @xcite have conspicuous high excitation fe  iii features at maximum and the usual sn  ia features develop later .",
