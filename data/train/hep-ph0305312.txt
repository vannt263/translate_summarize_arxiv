    "the neutrino oscillation interpretations of the solar@xcite and kamland@xcite neutrino experiments , atmospheric@xcite neutrino data , and the lsnd experiment@xcite require three neutrino mass - squared differences of different orders of magnitude@xcite .",
    "since it is not possible to obtain this within the standard model framework of three active neutrinos it has been proposed to introduce a light sterile neutrino@xcite to reconcile all the experimental hints for neutrino oscillations . here",
    "we present an analysis of the global neutrino oscillation data in terms of four - neutrino mass schemes , including data from solar , kamland and atmospheric neutrino experiments , the lsnd experiment , as well as data from short - baseline ( sbl ) experiments@xcite and reactor experiments@xcite reporting no evidence for oscillations .",
    "we find that for all possible types of four - neutrino schemes different sub - sets of the data are in serious disagreement and hence , four - neutrino oscillations _ do not _ provide a satisfactory description of the global oscillation data including lsnd .",
    "the details of our calculations can be found in refs .",
    "four - neutrino mass schemes are usually divided into the two classes ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:4spectra ] .",
    "we note that ( 3 + 1 ) mass spectra include the three - active neutrino scenario as limiting case . in this case",
    "solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are explained by active neutrino oscillations , with mass - squared differences @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the fourth neutrino state gets completely decoupled .",
    "we will refer to such limiting scenario as ( 3 + 0 ) .",
    "in contrast , the ( 2 + 2 ) spectrum is intrinsically different , as there must be a significant contribution of the sterile neutrino either in solar or in atmospheric neutrino oscillations or in both .",
    "the six four - neutrino mass spectra , divided into the classes ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2 ) . ]    neglecting cp violation , in general neutrino oscillations in four - neutrino schemes are described by 9 parameters : 3 mass - squared differences and 6 mixing angles in the unitary lepton mixing matrix .",
    "here we use a parameterisation introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on physically relevant quantities : the 6 parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are similar to the two - neutrino mass - squared differences and mixing angles and are directly related to the oscillations in solar , atmospheric and the lsnd experiments . for the remaining 3 parameters we use @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here , @xmath8 is the fraction of @xmath9 participating in solar oscillations , and ( @xmath10 ) is the fraction of @xmath11 participating in oscillations with @xmath1 ( for exact definitions see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the analysis we adopt the following approximations : ( 1 ) we make use of the hierarchy @xmath12 .",
    "this means that for each data set we consider only one mass - squared difference , the other two are set either to zero or to infinity .",
    "( 2 ) in the analyses of solar and atmospheric data ( but not for sbl data ) we set @xmath13 , which is justified because of strong constraints from reactor experiments@xcite .",
    "parameter dependence of the different data sets in our parameterisation . ]    due to these approximations the parameter structure of the four - neutrino analysis gets rather simple .",
    "the parameter dependence of the four data sets solar , atmospheric , lsnd and nev is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "the nev data set contains the experiments karmen@xcite , cdhs@xcite , bugey@xcite and chooz / palo verde@xcite , reporting no evidence for oscillations .",
    "we see that only @xmath14 links solar and atmospheric data and @xmath7 links atmospheric and nev data .",
    "lsnd and nev data are coupled by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the strong preference of oscillations into active neutrinos in solar and atmospheric oscillations leads to a direct conflict in ( 2 + 2 ) oscillation schemes .",
    "we will now show that thanks to the latest solar neutrino data ( especially from sno@xcite ) in combination with the kamland experiment@xcite , and the improved sk statistic on atmospheric neutrinos@xcite the tension in the data has become so strong that ( 2 + 2 ) oscillation schemes are essentially ruled out .    the thin lines in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : etas ] show the @xmath15 of latest solar data as a function of @xmath14 , the parameter describing the fraction of the sterile neutrino participating in solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "the 99% cl bounds @xmath16 , when the ssm constraint on the @xmath17b - flux is included , and @xmath18 for free @xmath17b - flux reflect the strong preference for active neutrino oscillations of solar data .",
    "recently , the outstanding results of the kamland reactor experiment@xcite confirmed the lma solution of the solar neutrino problem@xcite .",
    "apart from this very important result the sensitivity of kamland to an admixture of a sterile neutrino is rather limited ( see think lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : etas ] ) .",
    "the combined analysis leads to the 99% cl bound @xmath19 for @xmath17b free , whereas in the ssm constrained case the bound is unchanged .     from solar and kamland data as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "right : @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 as a function of @xmath14 in ( 2 + 2 ) oscillation schemes . ]    in contrast , in ( 2 + 2 ) schemes atmospheric data imply @xmath23 at 99% cl , in clear disagreement with the bound from solar data . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : etas ] we show the @xmath24 for solar data and for atmospheric combined with sbl data as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , we show the @xmath24 of the global data defined by @xmath25 from the figure we find that only if we take both data sets at the 99.95% cl a value of @xmath14 exists , which is contained in the allowed regions of both sets .",
    "this follows from the @xmath24-value @xmath26 shown in the figure . in refs .",

    "we conclude that ( 2 + 2 ) oscillation schemes are highly disfavoured by the disagreement between the latest solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",

    "it is known for a long time@xcite that ( 3 + 1 ) mass schemes are disfavoured by the comparison of sbl disappearance data@xcite with the lsnd result . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have calculated an upper bound on the lsnd oscillation amplitude @xmath30 resulting from nev and atmospheric neutrino data . from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 + 1 ] we see that this bound is incompatible with the signal observed in lsnd at the 95% cl .",
    "only marginal overlap regions exist between the bound and global lsnd data if both are taken at 99% cl .",
    "an analysis in terms of the parameter goodness of fit@xcite shows that for most values of @xmath4 nev and atmospheric data are compatible with lsnd only at more than @xmath31 , with one exception around @xmath32 ev@xmath33 , where the pg reaches 1% .",

    "@xcite we are able to perform a global fit to the oscillation data in the four - neutrino framework .",
    "this approach allows to statistically compare the different hypotheses .",
    "let us first evaluate the gof of ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2 ) spectra with the help of the pg method described in ref .",
    "we divide the global oscillation data in the 4 data sets sol , atm , lsnd and nev . following ref .",

    "[ tab : pg ] we show the contributions of the 4 data sets to @xmath37 for ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2 ) oscillation schemes .",
    "as expected we observe that in ( 3 + 1 ) schemes the main contribution comes from sbl data due to the tension between lsnd and nev data in these schemes . for ( 2 + 2 ) oscillation schemes",
    "a large part of @xmath38 comes from solar and atmospheric data , however , also sbl data contributes significantly .",
    "this comes mainly from the tension between lsnd and karmen@xcite , which does not depend on the mass scheme and , hence , also contributes in the case of ( 2 + 2 ) .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath38 in tab .",
    "[ tab : pg ] for ( 2 + 2 ) schemes are higher than the one given in sec .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the parameter goodness of fit is now obtained by evaluating @xmath38 for 4 dof@xcite .",
    "this number of degrees of freedom corresponds to the 4 parameters @xmath39 describing the coupling of the different data sets ( see eq .",
    "( [ chi2bar ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "the best gof is obtained in the ( 3 + 1 ) case . however , even in this best case the pg is only 0.56% .",
    "the pg of @xmath40 for ( 2 + 2 ) schemes shows that these mass schemes are essentially ruled out by the disagreement between the individual data sets .",
    "although we have seen that none of the four - neutrino mass schemes can provide a reasonable good fit to the global oscillation data including lsnd , it might be interesting to consider the _ relative _ status of the three hypotheses ( 3 + 1 ) , ( 2 + 2 ) and the three - active neutrino scenario ( 3 + 0 ) .",
    "this can be done by comparing the @xmath24 values of the best fit point ( which is in the ( 3 + 1 ) scheme ) with the one corresponding to ( 2 + 2 ) and ( 3 + 0 ) .",
    "first we observe that ( 2 + 2 ) schemes are strongly disfavoured with respect to ( 3 + 1 ) with a @xmath41 , implying a cl of 99.87% for 4 dof .",
    "further we find that ( 2 + 2 ) is only slightly better than ( 3 + 0 ) , which is disfavoured with a @xmath42 with respect to ( 3 + 1 ) .",
    "recently a precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation has been published by the wmap collaboration@xcite . under certain assumptions about the cosmological model and in combination with other cosmological data a stringent upper bound on the sum of the neutrino masses @xmath43 ev is obtained@xcite . since this",
    "bound is of the same order as @xmath44 it will lead to further restrictions in four - neutrino mass schemes@xcite . to combine this information with data from oscillation experiments we use the results of an analysis performed by s.  hannestad@xcite .",
    "there , wmap@xcite results have been combined with other cmb data@xcite , data from the large scale structure survey 2dfgrs@xcite , the hst hubble key project@xcite , and type ia supernovae observations@xcite .",
    "it has been found that a non - zero @xmath45 can be compensated partially by an increase in the effective number of neutrino species .",
    "therefore , the original bound obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was calculated assuming three neutrinos , can not be applied in a straightforward way . in the case of four neutrinos",
    "a somewhat weaker bound of @xmath46 ev ( 95% cl ) is obtained@xcite . to combine this result with data from oscillation experiments we use the @xmath24 from cosmology for four neutrinos , shown in fig .",

    "@xcite under this assumption is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cosmology ] as a function of @xmath4 . from the left panel of this figure",
    "one finds that cosmology excludes the region @xmath49 ev@xmath33 .",
    "however , the islands at @xmath50 ev@xmath33 and 1.7 ev@xmath33 are practically unaffected by cosmological data . performing a gof analysis",
    "shows that adding cosmological data gives @xmath51 and 19.6 for the two islands .",
    "this should be evaluated for 5 dof@xcite , leading to a pg of 0.43% and 0.15% , respectively , which is comparable to the value given for ( 3 + 1 ) in tab .",
    "[ tab : pg ] .",
    "we note , however , that a modest improvement of the bound on @xmath45 by future cosmological data will drastically worsen the fit of the last remaining islands in the four - neutrino parameter space .",
    "a further cosmological constraint on four - neutrino schemes comes from big bang nucleo synthesis ( bbn)@xcite . in the absence of any non - standard mechanism , like a large lepton number asymmetry , ( 3 + 1 ) as well as ( 2 + 2 ) schemes will lead to an effective number of neutrino species @xmath52@xcite .",
    "this is in conflict with the upper bound on @xmath53 derived in recent analyses@xcite including cmb and bbn data .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty related to the primordial abundances of he and d , upper bounds in the range @xmath54 ( @xmath55)@xcite are obtained .",
    "performing a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data we find that four - neutrino schemes do not provide a satisfactory fit to the data :    @xmath56 the strong rejection of non - active oscillation in the solar+kamland and atmospheric neutrino data rules out ( 2 + 2 ) schemes , independent of whether lsnd is confirmed or not .",
    "using an improved goodness of fit method especially sensitive to the combination of data sets we obtain a gof of only @xmath57 for ( 2 + 2 ) schemes .",
    "@xmath56 ( 3 + 1 ) spectra are disfavoured by the disagreement of lsnd with short - baseline disappearance data , leading to a marginal gof of @xmath58 .",
    "if lsnd should be confirmed we need more data on @xmath59 and/or @xmath11 sbl disappearance to decide about the status of ( 3 + 1 ) .",
    "@xmath56 recent cosmological data lead to further restrictions of the allowed parameter space .",
    "only two islands aground @xmath50 ev@xmath33 and 1.7 ev@xmath33 in hierarchical ( 3 + 1 ) schemes survive .",
    "our analysis brings the lsnd hint to a more puzzling status , and the situation will become even more puzzling if lsnd should be confirmed by the up - coming miniboone experiment@xcite .",
    "recently an explanation in terms of five neutrinos has been proposed@xcite .",
    "in such a ( 3 + 2 ) scheme solar and atmospheric data are explained dominantly by active oscillations , similar to the ( 3 + 1 ) case .",
    "the fit of sbl data is improved with respect to ( 3 + 1 ) by involving two large mass splittings @xmath60 ev@xmath33 and @xmath61 ev@xmath33 .",
    "alternative explanations of lsnd by anomalous muon decay@xcite seem to be in disagreement with the negative result of karmen , or require a very radical modification of standard physics , like cpt violation@xcite .",
