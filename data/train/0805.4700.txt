    "the standard paradigm of cataclysmic variable ( cv ) evolution assumes that orbital angular momentum ( am ) is lost via both gravitational radiation and magnetic braking at orbital periods @xmath6 , and purely by gravitational radiation for @xmath7 ( e.g. warner 1995 ; king 1988 ) .",
    "however , the am loss rate associated with magnetic braking is ill - constrained , and it is unclear if magnetic braking ceases to be a sink of am for @xmath7 @xcite .    extrapolating the work of @xcite who investigated the spin down rates of g - type stars by a magnetically coupled stellar wind , @xcite obtained the magnetic braking am loss rate of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the spin frequency of the donor star .",
    "as a consequence of the am losses and the mass loss they drive , the donor star is unable to maintain thermal equilibrium .",
    "this causes donors with masses @xmath10 m@xmath11 to exceed their equilibrium radius @xcite .",
    "mass loss will eventually cause the donor star to become fully convective at a mass @xmath12 and when @xmath13 . at this point",
    "it is suggested that either the magnetic activity of the donor star discontinuously decreases , or the topology of the magnetic field changes @xcite .",
    "this is based on the result that the interface between the radiative core and the convective envelope play a key role in the generation of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "when magnetic braking ceases at @xmath14 the donor shrinks within its roche lobe , mass transfer is shut off and the secondary re - attains thermal equilibrium .",
    "the system is no longer observed as a cv .",
    "subsequent orbital evolution of the cv is driven by gravitational radiation only .",
    "mass transfer resumes again when the secondary star makes contact with its roche lobe once more at @xmath15 .",
    "this disrupted magnetic model was conceived to explain the lack of observed cvs in the range @xmath16 ( rappaport , verbunt & joss 1983 ; spruit & ritter 1983 ) , as shown in figure [ pdist ] .    , indicated on the right axis . ]",
    "however , despite the success of this model in reproducing the correct width and position of the period gap ( e.g. kolb , king & ritter 1998 ) , there is no independent observational support for disrupted magnetic braking .",
    "observations of young , open clusters ( sills , pinsonneault & terndrup 2000 ) show that the spin down rate of rapidly rotating single stars is much less than predicted by the @xcite relation . also ,",
    "no discontinuous decline in magnetic activity for the fully convective stars is detected ( jones , fischer & stauffer 1996 ) .",
    "it is likely that for the high rotational speeds of @xmath17 km s@xmath18 of the cv donor stars , the am loss rate , @xmath19 , due to magnetic braking will saturate ( for a review see e.g. collier - cameron 2002 ) .",
    "@xcite suggest the form @xmath20 in the saturated regime . within this scheme",
    "the am loss rate in cvs would be a factor of 100 less than that for the standard magnetic braking model , and the donor star would not be sufficiently driven out of thermal equilibrium and no period gap would arise @xcite .    such theoretical and observational problems with the standard model of cv evolution aside ,",
    "it is the only one thus far that predicts a period gap of the correct width with edges at the correct orbital periods .",
    "two recent pieces of evidence in support for the disrupted magnetic braking model lies in the mass - radius relation of donor stars in cvs ( smith & dhillon 1998 ; patterson et al . 2005 ; knigge 2006 ) and in the effective temperatures of the accretion - heated white dwarfs in cvs ( townsley & bildsten 2003 ) . in the former , the donor mass - radius relation for @xmath21 lies systematically above that for isolated main sequence stars .",
    "this is consistent with the donor star being driven out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , a discontinuous decrease in the donor radii between @xmath22 has been detected . in the latter piece of evidence , the effective temperatures of white dwarfs are higher above the period gap than below , and are overall consistent with the expected accretion heating for mass transfer rates predicted by the disrupted magnetic braking model .",
    "politano & weiler ( 2006 ) calculated the secondary star mass distribution of present day pcebs for a range of am loss prescriptions , including disrupted magnetic braking .",
    "they found that the number of pcebs per secondary mass interval decreases by 38 per cent once magnetic braking begins to drive their evolution for secondaries with radiative cores .",
    "they suggest that this decrease in the number of pcebs with secondaries between @xmath3 0.25 and 0.5 m@xmath11 provides an observable test for the disruption of magnetic braking .",
    "in this paper we suggest an alternative , even more direct , test for the disruption of magnetic braking by investigating a more explicit consequence : the existence of a population of wdms binaries that were cvs in the past but became detached at @xmath13 and are currently crossing the period gap .",
    "we call these dcvs .    using population synthesis techniques we calculate the present day population of these dcvs , as well as wdms binaries that have emerged from a common envelope ( ce ) phase .",
    "we call these systems post - ce binaries ( pcebs ) .",
    "in particular , we only consider pcebs which will begin mass transfer within the period gap . for our stellar models and choice of gap boundaries ,",
    "such systems have secondary masses in the range @xmath23 .",
    "this sub - set of pcebs we henceforth designate as gpceb systems .",
    "note that gpcebs have @xmath24 but can also have @xmath25 .",
    "as we will show below orbital the period distribution of the combined population of dcvs and gpcebs reveals a prominent peak within the period gap due to an excess of dcvs over gpcebs here .",
    "we calculate the ratio dcv : gpceb within the period gap , which indicates the height of this peak , for a range of models concerning the values of the ce ejection efficiency , @xmath2 , the initial distribution of secondary mass , and the am loss rate due to magnetic braking .",
    "the detection of such a feature in the orbital period distribution of an observed sample of wdms binaries with orbital periods of a few hours would provide a simple test for the disruption of magnetic braking .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is currently creating the opportunity for large - scale observational studies of wdms binaries , having identified already more than 1000 systems ( silvestri et al .",
    "2007 ; schreiber , nebot gomez - moran & schwope 2007 ) .",
    "attempts to establish the subsample of pcebs among those systems and measuring their orbital periods as well as their stellar properties is underway ( rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "2007 , schreiber et al .",
    "we are optimistic that a quantitative test of the calculations carried out in this paper , and hence of the validity of the disrupted magnetic braking hypothesis , will be feasible in the near future .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the computational method , in section 3 we present our simulation results , which are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we conclude our investigation in section 5 .",
    "the computational method we apply consists of two main steps ; the first is to calculate the zero - age populations of the dcvs ( i.e. cvs that have just detached at the upper edge of the period gap ) and pcebs ( i.e. wdms binaries that have just emerged from a ce phase ) using the population synthesis code biseps ( willems & kolb 2002 ; willems & kolb 2004 ) .",
    "these populations are unweighted i.e. no formation probabilities are yet calculated for the systems .",
    "the code employs the single star evolution ( sse ) formulae described in @xcite and a binary system evolution scheme based on that described in @xcite .",
    "the second step uses a different code introduced in willems et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which calculates the present day populations of these systems using a library of evolutionary tracks , here produced by biseps itself .",
    "the procedure is described in more detail in the following sections .",
    "biseps evolves a large number of binary systems , which initially consist of two zero - age main sequence stellar components .",
    "the stars are assumed to have a population i chemical composition and the orbits are circular at all times .",
    "the initial primary and secondary masses are in the range 0.1 to 20 m@xmath11 , while the initial orbital periods range from 0.1 to 100 000 d. there is one representative binary configuration per grid cell within a three - dimensional grid consisting of 60 logarithmically spaced points in primary and secondary mass and 300 logarithmically spaced points in orbital period .",
    "there are @xmath26 binaries that are evolved for a maximum evolution time of 10 gyr . for symmetry reasons only systems with @xmath27",
    "are evolved .",
    "we calculate the four dimensional probability density functions @xmath28 of all zero - age dcvs and @xmath29 for all zero - age pcebs using the initial distribution functions quoted below . here",
    "@xmath30 is the time since the birth of the galaxy , @xmath31 is the mass of the white dwarf , @xmath32 is the mass of the secondary star and @xmath33 is the orbital period .",
    "the number of zero - age main sequence primaries , @xmath34 , that form with masses in the range @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 , where the probability density function , @xmath37 , is given by    @xmath38    ( kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ) .",
    "the probability that a zero - age main sequence secondary star forms with a mass @xmath32 can be determined from the initial mass ratio distribution ( imrd ) given by    @xmath39    where @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a constant , and @xmath42 is a normalisation factor such that @xmath43 ( @xmath44 for @xmath45 ) .",
    "we also consider the case where the secondary mass is determined from an imf according to equation ( [ m1dist ] ) where @xmath46 is replaced with @xmath32 .",
    "we use @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath47 , as our reference model . finally , the probability that a binary forms with an initial orbital separation @xmath48 is determined by ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; hurley et al . 2002 ) @xmath49    we further assume that all stars in the galaxy are formed in binaries and that the galaxy has an age of 10 gyr .",
    "the star formation rate , @xmath50 , is calculated by assuming that one binary per year is formed with @xmath51 .",
    "combining this with the galactic volume of @xmath52 pc@xmath53 gives an average local birthrate of white dwarfs of @xmath54 pc@xmath55 yr@xmath18 , consistent with observations ( weidemann 1990 ) .",
    "the lower limit of 0.8 m@xmath11 is the smallest mass the primary star can have if it is to evolve into a white dwarf within the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "we therefore have @xmath56 from ( [ m1dist ] ) and ( [ sfr ] ) we obtain @xmath57 yr@xmath18 .",
    "we assume that this is constant throughout the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "we then employ a population calculator to convert @xmath58 and @xmath59 into distributions over @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath60 describing the present day population of dcvs and gpcebs .",
    "the secular evolution of each system in the zero - age populations is therefore followed using biseps , and its contribution to the population , determined by the above distribution function and star formation rate , is accounted for at each stage of its evolution .",
    "the ce phase @xcite is modelled by equating the binding energy of the primary s envelope to the change in the total orbital energy of the binary system .",
    "quantitatively this is @xmath61 \\label{ce},\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the gravitational constant , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the masses of the primary s core ( the proto - white dwarf ) and envelope , @xmath65 is the radius of the primary immediately before the onset of the ce phase , and @xmath32 is the mass of the secondary .",
    "the orbital separation of the stellar components immediately before and after the ce phase are @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath2 is the fraction of the orbital energy used to unbind the envelope from the core of the primary and @xmath68 is the ratio between the approximate form of the binding energy @xmath69 and the true binding energy . throughout our investigation",
    "we use @xmath70 , which is consistent with the value used by willems & kolb ( 2004 ) .",
    "we take @xmath71 as our reference model ` a ' .",
    "once the ce has been ejected from the system , then if the binary s stellar components have avoided a collision , what remains is a pceb system .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the system is driven by orbital am losses ; a combination of magnetic braking and gravitational radiation if the secondary mass is larger than the mass of a fully convective , isolated main sequence star , @xmath72 , and purely by gravitational radiation otherwise .",
    "the system will become semi - detached once the orbital separation has decreased sufficiently so that the secondary star is brought into contact with its roche lobe . if the mass ratio @xmath73 then mass transfer driven by am losses will ensue .",
    "if , however , @xmath74 then the secondary will undergo thermal timescale mass transfer ( ttmt ) . depending on the initial mass ratio and evolutionary state , some of these systems may reappear as am - driven cvs .",
    "it is thought that as many as 40 per cent @xcite of the present population of cvs may have formed in this way .",
    "the detection of cno abundance anomalies supports this hypothesis , placing a lower limit of 10 per cent on the fraction of post - ttmt systems among the observed population of cvs ( gnsicke et al .",
    "determination of the parameters at which the ttmt phase reverts to the standard am - driven phase would require a comprehensive treatment of the ttmt phase , and would depend on the fate of the transferred material ( schenker 2001 ) .",
    "we therefore only consider the contribution of purely am driven cvs in the present investigation .      in our calculations , we consider the impact of changing the common envelope ejection efficiency @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to constant , global values of @xmath2 we follow politano & weiler ( 2007 ) and consider the possibility that @xmath2 could be a function of the secondary mass .",
    "we adopt @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a free parameter .",
    "figure [ alpha_m2 ] shows how @xmath2 varies with @xmath32 for @xmath77 , 1.0 and 2.0 .",

    "we can estimate that the number of dcvs currently occupying the galaxy is @xmath130 , while the number of gpcebs is in the range @xmath131 , giving a factor of @xmath132 to @xmath133 more dcvs than gpcebs .",
    "hence we predict a prominent peak in the orbital period distribution of short orbital period wdms systems as shown in figure [ y3_hce01-hce06 ] . in determining these predictions",
    ", we have assumed that magnetic braking takes the form shown in equation ( [ hurley_mb ] ) .    , @xmath134 ( dashed line ) and @xmath79 ( dotted line ) . ]    of course , the am loss rate associated with magnetic braking is not very well constrained , and indeed it has been suggested that the magnetic braking strength is @xmath135 weaker than the forms we have used in this investigation ( andronov et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , we have not considered the forms of magnetic braking that include a saturation point if the secondary star has a spin frequency larger than some critical value @xmath136 ( sills et al .",
    "2000 ; ivanova & taam 2003).this is because , in the case of the sills et al .",
    "( 2000 ) form of magnetic braking , the am loss rate would be too small to sufficiently drive the donor star out of thermal equilibrium , and consequently produce a period gap . furthermore , the sills et al .",
    "( 2000 ) form of magnetic braking predict mass transfer rates at the upper edge of the period gap that are too low compared to observations , and as such would not explain the presence of nova - like cvs above the period gap ( e.g. kolb 2002 ) .",
    "the ivanova & taam ( 2003 ) form of magnetic braking on the other hand , which is @xmath3 2 to 3 times weaker than the verbunt & zwaan ( 1982 ) form , would drive the donor star out of thermal equilibrium but not enough to explain the observed width of the period gap .",
    "such forms of magnetic braking are therefore inconsistent with the disrupted magnetic braking model . instead",
    ", alternative mechanisms must exist that combine in strength to reach the value that we consider at the upper edge of the period gap .",
    "we now discuss the impact the location of the period gap has on our results .",
    "we note that knigge ( 2006 ) , using a similar method to ours , determined that the period gap edges are 2.15 h and 3.18 h , which agrees with our determined period gap width of one hour .",
    "we attribute the slight difference between the two locations of the period gap to the two different catalogues used .",
    "knigge ( 2006 ) used the ritter & kolb ( 2003 ) catalogue ( edition 7.6 ) , while we use the latest edition 7.7 .",
    "if the period gap was located according to knigge ( 2006 ) , this would have the effect of increasing the population of gpcebs within the period gap , and consequently decrease the ratio dcv : gpceb .",
    "the higher values of @xmath99 and @xmath98 would shift the mass range of gpcebs to @xmath137 , and therefore a larger fraction of gpcebs ( those with @xmath138 ) would be driven by magnetic braking . in turn , the flow rate of gpcebs from longer orbital periods into @xmath93 would increase .",
    "we also point out that a similar uncertainty is introduced with the value of @xmath72 , as this is not well constrained by stellar evolution models .    in their studies on circumbinary disk driven cvs willems et al .",
    "( 2005 ) considered the cv population below the gap , while willems et al .",
    "( 2007 ) studied the population above the gap .",
    "these authors never attempted to systematically model , or to achieve a best fit model for , the combined population .",
    "this is why their adopted period gap boundaries of 2.25 and 2.75 hours , respectively , result in an implausibly narrow gap when taken together .",
    "nonetheless we investigated how a narrower period gap would affect our results by calculating a further population model with the gap boundaries set to 2.25 and 2.75 hours .",
    "we considered @xmath71 with our standard imrd , and re - calibrated equation ( [ hurley_mb ] ) to give the am loss rate appropriate for the narrower gap width .",
    "we find that dcv : gpceb decreases to 2.1 compared to our model ha value of 3.5 .",
    "thus the prominence of the peak would decrease somewhat .",
    "this is because the time for a dcv to cross a narrower gap would decrease ( we find @xmath139 myr ) , decreasing the present day population from @xmath82 for model ha to @xmath140 .",
    "the number of gpcebs in the period gap also decreases from @xmath141 for model ha to @xmath142 because the systems occupy a smaller area in period space .",
    "we emphasise that a gap width of half an hour is a somewhat extreme assumption . despite this",
    "we still obtain a clear excess of dcvs over gpcebs in the period gap , and hence a prominent peak would still be detected .",
    "indeed , a prominent peak would still be detected for any reasonable gap width .",
    "observational investigations have shown that in many cvs above the period gap the donor is unlikely to be an unevolved main sequence donor ( e.g. beuermann et al .",
    "1998 ) . instead",
    ", the spectral types of the donor are later than those of an isolated star of the same mass , while donors at orbital periods longer than 5 to 6 hours are nuclear evolved ( patterson et al . 2005 ; knigge 2006 ) .",
    "theoretical calculations also predict this effect ( baraffe & kolb 2000 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that such systems had an initial ttmt phase where the secondary star was much more massive than the white dwarf ( schenker & king 2002 ) .",
    "kolb & willems ( 2005 ) find that as much as 40 per cent of zero - age cvs form with a donor that has evolved more than half way through its main sequence lifetime .",
    "gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have detected cno abundance anomalies consistent with nuclear evolved donors among @xmath143 per cent cvs in a sample observed in the ultraviolet , corroborating the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the known cv population may be post - ttmt systems .",
    "such cvs , if they appear after their initial ttmt phase above the period gap , may contribute to the present day population of dcvs .",
    "thus our values of dcv : gpceb , which are calculated from the evolution of purely am driven cvs , are lower limits . to calculate",
    "the contribution of post - ttmt cvs to the total dcv population would require a comprehensive treatment of the ttmt phase including the fate of the transferred material , which determines the point of re - appearance of the system as a ` normal ' am driven cv .",
    "we now consider how the contribution of magnetic cvs ( mcvs ) may affect the ratio dcv : gpceb within the period gap .",
    "intermediate polars ( ips ) are thought to evolve as non - magnetic cvs and hence become detached at the upper edge of the period gap due to the disruption of magnetic braking . their contribution to the population of dcvs",
    "is therefore already taken into account in our calculations , as are their progenitors to the gpceb population .",
    "polars , on the other hand , may not become detached at the upper edge of the period gap , as it has been suggested that magnetic braking for these systems is estimated to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude weaker than for non - magnetic cvs ( li , wu & wickramasinghe 1994 ; li , wu & wickramasinghe 1994b ) .",
    "this is supported observationally from their white dwarf temperatures : the accretion - heated white dwarfs in polars are consistently colder than those in non - magnetic cvs at similar orbital periods , implying lower accretion rates , and hence angular momentum loss rates ( araujo - betancor et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this difference is especially pronounced above the period gap , where magnetic braking is the dominant am loss agent .    furthermore , no progenitor wdms systems of mcvs with a magnetic white dwarf has as yet been detected ( liebert et al .",
    "it is possible that such progenitors evolve in the same way as progenitors of non - magnetic cvs .",
    "in such a case , the population of wdms progenitors of polars will already be taken into account in our calculations and are included in the number of gpcebs we obtained .",
    "the overall effect of the above on our results would be to reduce the number of dcvs and hence the ratio dcv : gpceb by the fraction of polars among the total cv population . from the ritter & kolb ( 2002 ) catalogue , edition 7.7 ( 2006 ) , we find that polars contribute @xmath133 per cent to the total cv population .      here",
    "we discuss the current situation regarding pceb candidates and the surveys presently searching for them .",
    "schreiber & gnsicke ( 2003 ) studied 30 well observed pcebs , which were chosen to be representative of pcebs that will begin mass transfer within the hubble time .",
    "these systems have orbital periods @xmath1442 days , have mass ratios less than 1 , and do not include secondaries that are sub - giants .",
    "they found that the majority of systems contained young ( @xmath145 yrs ) , hot ( @xmath1 15 000 - 22 000 k ) white dwarfs .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that until recently pceb candidates were almost exclusively identified in blue colour surveys such as the palomar green survey .",
    "thus , systems containing cool white dwarfs and/or early type companion stars have been missed in most previous work , with the exception of a few systems identified as nearby large proper motion systems ( e.g. rrcae ) or spectroscopic binaries ( e.g. v471tau ) .",
    "the potential of observational population studies of pcebs has improved over the past few years dramatically through the sdss . because of the vast @xmath146 colour space probed by sdss , coupled with the availability of high - quality follow - up spectroscopy of a large number of objects with non - stellar colours , has already lead to the identification of more than 1000 wdms binaries ( silvestri et al .",
    "2007 ) , most of them being by - products of the search for quasars . a complementary program targeting specifically wdms binaries containing cool white dwarfs and/or early type companions is underway to compensate the bias against such systems in the previous surveys ( schreiber et al . 2007 ) .",
    "for the first phase , the pcebs among the full sample of wdms binaries have to be identified through radial velocity studies .",
    "a first effort along these lines has been carried out by rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who identified 18 pceb candidates from multiple sdss spectroscopy obtained for 101 wdms .",
    "rebassa - mansergas ( 2008 , in preparation ) confirmed through follow - up spectroscopy so far six of those candidates as pcebs with orbital periods ranging from 164min to 1048min . additional identification work of the pcebs among the sdss wdms is currently carried out at the vlt ( schreiber et al .",
    "2008 ) and the wht ( gnsicke et al . in preparation ) .",
    "it is foreseeable that , sufficient observational effort being invested , it will be possible to build up an orbital period distribution of close wdms binaries comprising potentially a few hundred systems . while the sdss pceb sample will not be free of selection effects ( see e.g. rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "2007 ; pretorius , knigge & kolb 2006 ) , those biases can be modelled to a large degree .",
    "it appears hence feasible to subject the disrupted magnetic braking model to a stringent test by comparing such an observed orbital period distribution to the predictions of our work here ( figure [ y3_hce01-hce06 ] ) .",
    "we have performed population synthesis calculations to obtain the present day population of two types of white dwarf - main sequence star systems within the 2 to 3 hour cataclysmic variable period gap .",
    "the first are post - ce binaries with secondaries that have masses @xmath0 , and so will commence mass transfer in the period gap ( gpcebs ) .",
    "the second type are systems that were cvs in the past , but detached at the upper edge of the period gap as a consequence of disrupted magnetic braking , and are crossing the period gap via gravitational radiation ( dcvs ) .",
    "our calculations were repeated to consider constant , global values of the ce ejection efficiency , @xmath2 , and cases where @xmath2 is a function of secondary mass according to equation ( [ alpha1 ] ) .",
    "we considered various forms of magnetic braking according to equation ( [ rvj_mb ] ) with @xmath121 and 4 , and equation ( [ hurley_mb ] ) .",
    "we find that there is a prominent peak in the orbital period distribution of the combined dcv and gpceb population , due to the excess of dcvs over gpcebs within the period gap .",
    "we find that the ratio dcv : gpceb , which gives an indication of the peak s height , decreases with an increasing global value of @xmath2 , while increasing with increasing value of @xmath76 .",
    "these trends are the same for all assumptions on the initial secondary mass distribution .",
    "the value of dcv : gpceb ranges from 0.5 for model hce5 where the secondary mass is determined independently from the primary mass using the same imf , to 62.5 for model hpwr2 where @xmath105 .    we find further that dcv : gpceb increases with increasing magnetic braking strength , although only slightly . for @xmath5 , dcv : gpceb increases from 3.5 for model ha ( the weakest ) to 6.0 for rvj4a ( the strongest ) .    for all our models we find that the values of dcv : gpceb are largest when the imrd function has the form @xmath105 i.e. on average systems will have more massive secondary stars .",
    "the smallest values occur when the secondary mass is determined from the same imf as the primary .",
    "the most likely value of dcv : gpceb is between @xmath132 to @xmath133 , thus we can expect a significant peak as shown in figure [ y3_hce01-hce06].we suggest that if such a feature is observed in the orbital period distribution of short orbital period wdms binaries , this would strongly corroborate the disruption of magnetic braking .",
