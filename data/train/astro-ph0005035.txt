    "the absorption coefficient is rather uncertain . in order to keep consistency with the values generally assumed in the literature ( e.g. : hildebrand @xcite ; knapp et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we take @xmath23 for @xmath24 m . with respect to other assumed values ,",
    "this tends to overestimate the dust mass ( e.g. by a factor of two as compared to the @xmath25 assumed by hughes et al .",
    ", @xcite ) .    the mfir average spectrum for our sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ spectr ] . in order to describe it better",
    ", we used also the following additional upper limits or median flux densities : @xmath26 5 mjy at 1.3 mm ( 230 ghz ) , as maximum flux density excess over the extrapolated synchrotron spectrum ( murgia et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; @xmath26 9 mjy at 12@xmath3 m and @xmath27 mjy at 25 @xmath3 m ( heckman et al .",

    "7 truecm    the dependence on frequency of the fir flux density in the observed wavelength range 12200 @xmath3 m ( @xmath28 ghz ) , can be described by a power law : @xmath29 at lower frequencies , however , the spectrum of the fir component must turn over to meet the 230 ghz upper limit .",
    "this spectrum is clearly not consistent with a single temperature .",
    "a multi  temperature fit ( as in models by sanders et al .",
    "@xcite ) would give a plausible range of temperatures between @xmath30 k and @xmath31 120 k in the wavelength range we have considered here .",
    "however , as the data quality is not sufficient to allow a meaningful multi  temperature fit , we have taken a simple two temperature approximation , with @xmath32 k and @xmath33 k. with corresponding dust masses @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we can reproduce the fir flux densities in the range from 60 @xmath3 m to 200 @xmath3 m .",
    "any dust component colder than 25 k is poorly constrained by our data .",
    "for instance , up to @xmath36 would be consistent with the 174/200 @xmath3 m median flux densities and the 1.3 mm upper limit if the temperature were @xmath37 k. in order to probe such low temperatures , measures at longer wavelengths would be required , as with scuba ( holland et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "to our knowledge , such data do not exist for our sources .    a comparison of our average mass estimates with those for nearby radio quiet ellipticals ( bregman et al .",
    "@xcite ) and nearby radio galaxies ( knapp et al .",
    "@xcite ) is not straightforward , as these estimates depend on the wavelengths available and on the assumed temperatures .",

    "knapp et al .",
    "( @xcite ) assume @xmath40 k and derive @xmath41 .    in our opinion , it is far from being excluded that the range of dust masses in these samples and in ours are similar , and the different estimates may be due to either the different assumed temperatures and/or to the different wavelength ranges explored .    using the two temperature approximation , we have also estimated dust masses for the brighter sources detected , or possibly detected , at more than one wavelength .",
    "the results of this calculations are presented in table [ bright - s ] .",
    "compared to the median values of the total sample , the sources 1345 + 145 , 3c318 , 1819 + 39 and 3c459 seem to have a higher mass of the warm dust component , while the cold dust masses seem to be similar .",
    "as the first three objects are a seyfert type galaxy , a quasar and a broad line radio galaxy , we may expect that a favorable orientation of the objects with respect to the line of sight allows us to see the warmer dust associated with the accretion disk .      according to the unification models ,",
    "the radio galaxies in our sample , which are very powerful in the radio band and have large luminosities in the narrow emission lines ( @xmath42erg s@xmath43 , gelderman & whittle , @xcite ) , are expected to harbor an obscured quasar ( see , e.g. , falcke et al .",
    "@xcite , in the context of `` jet / disk  symbiosis '' ) . a large fraction of the mfir emission",
    "would then originate from the dust in the absorbing torus itself , heated by the uv / x radiation emitted at its center , with some contribution from the interstellar medium , still heated by the central agn but now distributed over a scale of several kpc , and therefore with temperatures decreasing outwards .",
    "we expect this interstellar dust to emit its radiation at the longer wavelengths .",
    "if an obscured agn is present , adopting a heating model as in sanders et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we expect dust temperatures in a range similar to that estimated in sect .",
    "[ dust ] .",
    "if , instead , no agn is present and heating is due to the stellar radiation field only , the dust temperature could be @xmath44 30 k , as in nearby radio quiet elliptical galaxies ( bregman et al .",
    "the emission would then peak at @xmath45 m .",
    "an additional contribution to heating could arise from a burst of star formation , as may be the case in 3c459 .",
    "the interpretation based on heating by an obscured quasar is supported by the correlation between radio emission and mfir emission ( knapp et al .",
    "@xcite ; heckman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , with which our data are also consistent ( fig .",
    "[ knapp ] ) .",
    "also the strong luminosity in narrow lines , which is often interpreted as powered by photo  ionization , gives support to this interpretation .",
    "in addition we note that the mfir average spectrum ( for @xmath46 m ) in nearby radio quiet ellipticals ( bregman et al .",
    "@xcite ) is definitely steeper than that of our radio galaxies and of those in knapp et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",

    "[ fir - l ] ) and @xmath49 in knapp et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the heating processes are different , with the one in radio galaxies being more effective .",
    "we conclude that our observations are consistent with the mfir luminosity in these radio galaxies being powered primarily by the agn , and assume that most of the radiation comes from the `` obscuring torus '' .",
    "our average fir luminosities , consistent with the results of heckman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , are about a factor 4  5 lower than the fir luminosities of radio quasars of comparable radio luminosity ( see fig .",
    "[ spectr ] ) .",
    "this causes problems for the unification models ( see heckman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , since , if the torus dust is transparent at fir wavelengths , its emission should be orientation independent and the quasars should be as luminous in the fir as the radio galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , if the disk is optically thick in some wavelength range , one should justify the constant flux density ratio between radio galaxies and quasars over a broad wavelength range ( from 12 to 100 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "he s et al .",
    "( @xcite ) discuss the possibility that a beamed non  thermal component is present in quasars and contributes at the fir wavelengths .",
    "the original aim of this work was to study the cold phase of the interstellar medium in radio galaxies , in order to see whether its density is high enough to support the  frustration scenario \" for css / gps sources . in this scenario ,",
    "css / gps and large size radio galaxies have similar lifetimes , so that the difference in size ( more than a factor of 100 , on average , in our two samples , tables [ sample ] and [ sampler ] ) requires an environment significantly denser for the former ( de young @xcite ; fanti et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the hot component of the ism is too tenuous and has insufficient pressure to confine the radio source ( e.g. odea et al .",
    "@xcite ; readhead et al .",
    "thus the radio source must be confined via interaction with relatively cold dense material along the path of propagation . however , as anticipated in the introduction , even if a lot of dense cold gas is present in the host galaxy , distributed in the disk / torus of the `` unified models '' ( which is perpendicular to the radio axis ) it will have no effect on the radio source propagation .",
    "`` frustration '' , if present , must be due to the diffuse cold phase of the interstellar gas .",
    "> from ram pressure computations , the estimates of the density of the interstellar gas required to frustrate css radio galaxies imply masses @xmath50 within a volume of @xmath51 kpc in radius ( fanti et al .",
    "@xcite ) , corresponding , for a gas to dust ratio as in our own galaxy , to an excess dust mass @xmath52 .",
    "this would produce an excess in the fir emission of the css / gps , as compared to the large size radio galaxies , the exact amount depending on the dust temperature .",
    "the upper limits to any ir excess derived in sect .",
    "[ ave - det ] convert into an excess dust mass of @xmath53 for @xmath54 k , ( if heating is due to a powerful agn ) , which is not enough for the frustration model .",
    "even if we attribute the whole mfir emission we detect from css / gps to a frustrating medium only , and _ not _ to the dusty disk / torus , the implied mass ( for @xmath55 30 k ) , would be still not enough , the upper limits to the differences in the mfir emission being similar to the actual flux densities of css / gps sources .    as a consequence",
    ", we may be confident that there is no evidence for a component of the interstellar medium , with temperatures @xmath5630 k , significantly denser or more massive in css / gps galaxies to cause frustration .    for lower temperatures ,",
    "our fir observations are not sensitive enough to firmly constrain larger masses , since the emission would peak at @xmath57 m , and the uncertainties we have on the flux density limits at long wavelengths are too large to provide safe constraints . for instance , if the temperature were @xmath5820 k , up to 5@xmath59 of dust would be permitted .",
    "this should be probed by observations at longer ir wavelengths ( e.g. with scuba ) .",
    "an additional strong constraint on such large dust masses is obtained from the color properties of the host galaxies .",
    "dust masses as required by frustration , spread over @xmath60 10 kpc , would produce absorption in the optical band .",
    "the implied hydrogen column density , @xmath61 g @xmath62 , corresponds to an optical depth in the visual @xmath63 . applying a model of homogeneously mixed dust and stars ( as in goudfrooij & de jong @xcite )",
    ", the above dust mass implies @xmath64 mag . , and color reddening e(b  v ) @xmath65 , which is inconsistent with the data of de vries et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    if  frustration \" occurs only for gps ( sizes @xmath66 kpc ) , the implied masses are lower , but their temperature would be larger ( @xmath67 k , for a model as in sanders et al .",
    "@xcite ) , due to the closer proximity to the hidden quasar , so that the expected ir luminosity would be even more discrepant with what we observe .    the present conclusion is therefore that the fir radiation we detect with iso does not imply an amount of gas ( heated by the agn ) large enough to support the frustration scenario of css / gps radio sources .",
    "this is consistent with the results of owsianik et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and owsianik & conway ( @xcite ) , who found fast proper motions of the outer lobes in some small symmetric gps , and with the radio spectra analysis of css / gps by murgia et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we finally note that recent observations with scuba ( archibald et al .",
    "@xcite ) of high redshift radio galaxies , both css and large size ones , do not show any significant difference between the two classes of sources .",
    "the mfir properties of css / gps , however , point out a new problem for the alternative interpretation .",
    "an important ingredient of the  youth scenario \" is that the radio luminosity is required to decrease with increasing source size , in order to explain the numerical proportion of css / gps to large size sources . in the current models ,",
    "this luminosity evolution is essentially due to expansion of the lobe volumes in an external medium of decreasing density and not to a decline of the power carried by the jet with time .",
    "css / gps sources would evolve , with increasing size , toward lower luminosity larger size radio sources . this evolution in luminosity may also be described in terms of a higher efficiency for converting the beam power into radio band radiation ( see also gopal krishna & wiita @xcite ) in the early phases of the source evolution .    according to this idea , our two samples ( css / gps and comparison ) , which have very different sizes but similar radio luminosities , would have  radio engines \" of power different by a factor 10 or so ( css / gps being less powerful ) . as in the past",
    "there have been strong suggestions that the jet power is proportional to the bolometric luminosity of the agn ( e.g. baum & heckman @xcite ; rawlings & saunders @xcite ; falcke et al .",
    "@xcite ) , one would expect the css / gps to be definitely less powerful in the mfir ( and in the nl emission ) .",
    "this is not seen in our observations , at least at 60 and 90 @xmath3 m .",
    "although we have no obvious solution to this problem , we speculate here about a couple of possibilities .",
    "first there may be an additional source of heating arising from conversion of a fraction of the jet power where the jet interacts with the interstellar medium",
    ". this may be more effective at distances close to the nucleus and less so further out as the source ages .",
    "the existence of emission line gas aligned with the radio source in low redshift css sources is consistent with strong interaction between gps / css sources and the dense clouds in the ism ( de vries et al .",
    "such an effect should roughly compensate for the lower radiation power from the central engine in css / gps .    the second possibility is related to the scenario where the radio emission is triggered by a merger event .",
    "we speculate that in the early phase of the radio source life a large fraction of gas / dust is not fully settled in a disk / torus but is still distributed over a much larger solid angle , as seen from the central continuum source . in this scenario",
    "the fraction of intercepted and reprocessed uv radiation could be much higher in the younger / smaller sources , increasing their mfir emission .",
    "we might also expect the additional obscuration in the smaller sources to result in lower emission line luminosities and/or redder colors .",
    "this is not generally seen in gps and css sources , though there are a few cases which are consistent with this picture ( odea @xcite ; de vries et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition",
    ", this hypothesis would require the gas / dust to settle into a disk on a timescale much less than the age of a radio source ( @xmath68 yr ) in order to remove the extra obscuration before the sources propagate to scales larger than tens of kpc .",
    "at present , both of these explanations appear rather `` ad hoc '' .",
    "thus , this issue remains a problem for the current evolution models .",
