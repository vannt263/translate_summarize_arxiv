    "multi - colour observations of rr lyrae variables are extremely important to obtain information on their physical parameters , such as temperature , mass , and luminosity , which are essential to the understanding of the different characteristics of these stars in different clusters .",
    "one of the most significant differences is related to the separation of globular clusters into two groups according to the mean period of the rrab variables , which was found by oosterhoff ( 1939 , 1944 ) , namely @xmath2=0.55 days for group i ( ooi ) and @xmath2=0.65 days for group ii ( ooii ) .",
    "this `` dichotomy '' , later found to be related to the cluster metallicity ( arp 1955 ) , has been the basis for many subsequent studies which have led several authors , _ in primis _ sandage ( 1981 , 1990 , 1993 and references therein ) to define a luminosity - metallicity relation among rr lyrae stars as a result of this observed `` period - shift '' .",
    "the fiducial cluster in the study of this period - shift effect has traditionally been m3 for the ooi group .",
    "the data for the m3 rr lyraes , however , were still essentially the ubv photographic photometry by roberts and sandage ( 1955 ) , baker and baker ( 1956 ) and sandage ( 1959 ) , therefore a program was started in order to obtain more accurate ccd photometry for the study of the characteristics of both the colour - magnitude diagram and the rr lyrae variables in this cluster .",
    "m3 ( ngc5272 ; ra=13 42 11 , dec=+28 22 32 ( 2000 ) ; l=42@xmath3",
    "b=79@xmath3 ) is among the most important and prominent clusters in the northern hemisphere .",
    "it is located at @xmath4 11.6 kpc from the galactic center and 9.5 kpc above the plane , and is at 9.7 kpc from the sun ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "it contains the largest number of variable stars known within a single cluster ( 260 are quoted by suntzeff , kinman & kraft 1991 ) with a rather high specific frequency of rr lyraes ( i.e. normalized to total mass ) .",
    "the frequency of double - mode pulsators , however , is quite low : only three rrd are known ( nemec & clement 1989 , hereafter nc89 , and kaluzny et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter k97 ) , two of which ( v68 and v87 ) have been known to be rrd stars for some time , and the third one ( v79 ) has been identified as an rrd star only recently because it appears to have switched modes some time between 1962 and 1996 ( clement et al . 1997 ) .",
    "its metallicity , for a long time considered to be [ fe / h ] @xmath4 -1.6 , has been recently revised using high resolution spectroscopic data and appears to be somewhat higher , i.e. @xmath4 -1.4 ( carretta & gratton 1997 ) .",
    "m3 has been the target of a very large number of studies and analyses . for what concerns the photometry of rr lyrae variables , we mainly refer to roberts & sandage ( 1955 ) , baker & baker ( 1956 ) and sandage ( 1959 ) , which constituted the largest body of photometric data and was used as a basis for all subsequent studies of the global properties of rr lyraes .",
    "several more references on individual stars are listed in sawyer - hogg ( 1973 - hereafter sh73 ) and in the updated compilation of the sh73 catalogue by clement ( 1996 ) .",
    "the most recent ccd observations of rr lyraes in m3 are from k97 and from m. corwin ( private communication ) .",
    "in this paper we present a new photometric study of 60 rr lyrae variable stars in m3 , based on bvi ccd observations taken over a period of 5 years and a new independent absolute photometric calibration ( described in detail by ferraro et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter f97 ) . here",
    "we will present the observations and an initial analysis of the data .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the rr lyrae properties is deferred to a separate paper ( cacciari et al .",
    "1998 ) , whereas the new photometry of the extended sample of non - variable stars ( @xmath4 19,000 stars ) and related cmd have been presented and discussed by buonanno et al .",
    "( 1994 : hereinafter b94 ) and f97 .",
    "the observations were obtained at two sites , loiano ( bologna observatory , italy ) and the german - spanish astronomical center in calar alto ( spain ) .",
    "the loiano observations were taken in : march , 3 - 5 , 7 - 9 , and 11 1990 ; february , 7 1992 ; april , 10 - 11 1992 ; and may , 3 , 7 - 9 , and 11 1992 with the 152 cm f/8 ritchey - chretien telescope and an rca ccd 320x512 pixels , scale = 0.5arcsec / pixel , fov=240``x416 '' .",
    "because of the limited size of the field of view , two contiguous fields were observed ( see figure  [ fig - f1 ] and figure  [ fig - f2 ] ) to cover the se and nw halves of the cluster .",
    "even so , the most external variables could not be observed .",
    "the standard johnson bvi filters were used , and 65 and 69 frames in each colour were taken on the nw and se field respectively .",
    "the exposure times depended on conditions , and were typically @xmath4 5 min ( v ) , 10 - 15 min ( b ) and 4 min ( i ) for an average seeing of about 1.5 - 2 arcsec . in a few cases ,",
    "however , the seeing was significantly worse and the data have been discarded from the subsequent analysis .",
    "a total of 38 variables in the nw field and 22 variables in the se field have been measured based on previously identified positions ( sh73 ) , and for several of them improved or new periods have been determined ( see sect .",
    "no independent search for variability has been performed .",
    "the calar alto observations are only 5 data points spread over three almost contiguous nights ( march , 26 1995 and april , 1,2 1995 ) , and were taken mainly for calibration purposes .",
    "however they provide a good extension of the time baseline and have proven quite helpful in the period analysis .",
    "the observations were taken with the 1.23 m telescope , using a thinned 1024x1024 tektronix chip ( 24 @xmath5 pixel , 0.50 arcsec / pixel ) , with ar - coatings .",
    "the i filter is in the kron - cousins system , centered at 8020  . for an average seeing of 1.6 arcsec",
    "the typical exposure times were @xmath4 6 - 7 min ( v ) , 20 min ( b ) and 5 - 6 min ( i ) .",
    "the data reduction and absolute photometric calibration of the rr lyrae data is the same that was obtained and used for the construction of the new colour - magnitude diagram of m3 ( f97 ) . the absolute calibration in particular , which was the basic item for a new and independent analysis of the m3 characteristics , turned out to be a rather complicated and difficult problem to solve with the desired accuracy .",
    "since it has been discussed in great detail by f97 , along with the comparison with all previous relevant photometries , we refer the interested reader to this paper ; we shall quote and use their results when relevant .",
    "the photometry of the rr lyrae variables was carried out relatively to the local standard sequence that had been defined in each field , so as to cover the colour and magnitude range relevant for hb stars .",
    "the rr lyraes we have measured are identified in figure 1 .",
    "the local standard stars are listed in table  [ tab - locstan ] , where we give the photometric values with the new calibration of f97 .",
    "star identifications are from b94 .",
    "columns 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of table  [ tab - efemer1 ] contain the star identification , type and position in arcsec from the cluster center , taken from sh73 .",
    "the new periods and epochs are listed in columns 5 and 6 ( the epochs are the heliocentric julian days of maximum light ) .",

    "some scatter is present on the descending branch .",
    "since the minimum and maximum light are ( poorly ) covered by data taken on one night only , it is not possible to assess the presence of blazhko effect .    * v25 * : our best period is slightly longer than the period given by s65 , in agreement with the slightly positive o - c curve .",
    "there is some indication of larger than normal scatter on the descending branch and around minimum light .      *",

    ". this star was suggested by nc89 as a possible candidate double - mode pulsator with primary period p=0.470120 , but no secondary period could be found , so nc89 concluded that v28 is probably a blazhko variable .",
    "the period that best fits to our observations is p=0.4706131 , shorter than the value given by s65 and in agreement with the negative slope of the last oscillation in the o - c curve .",
    "some scatter in the data , especially on the descending branch , does indeed suggest variations that could be due to blazhko effect .",
    "* v30 * : this variable was included in the study by s73 .",
    "the best period we have found is slightly longer than the value given by s73 and sh73 , in agreement with the o - c trend derived by s73 .",
    "the star is near the cluster center and has very close companions that disturb the photometry , especially in the i band where the effect of poor seeing is more severe .      * v32 * : the period used by s65 is providing the best fit to our data as well , although the o - c was a slightly negative parabola .",
    "the star lies in a dense region near the center , and some of the scatter seen at minimum light may be due to larger photometric errors .    * v34 * : the period used by s65 provides the best fit to our data as well .",
    "there is clear evidence of variability in the light curve shape ( blazhko effect ) , especially at maximum light and on the descending branch , and the difference in the height of maxima amounts to about 0.4 mag , as already noticed by s65 .",
    "the nights jd47958 and jd49803 - 10 seem to share the same blazhko phase .",
    "the values in tables 3 and 4 correspond to the `` bright '' light curves .    *",

    "however this result is quite inaccurate since the light curves are strongly variable , with a @xmath9v at maximum light of about 0.35 mag .",
    "the values in tables 3 and 4 correspond to the `` bright '' light curves .      * v47 * : the star has a variable light curve , as already commented by s65 . our best period puts in phase the maxima , which differ by about 0.25 mag in v , but the calar alto data would suggest an even shorter period .    * v57 * : our new period is shorter than the period given by s65 , as expected from the strongly negative parabolic shape of the o - c curve .",
    "the scatter of the data is quite small and there is no indication of light curve variation .    * v58 * : our new period is slightly shorter than the period adopted by s65 , but the shape of the o - c diagram was irregular making any prediction difficult .",
    "the scatter of the data is very small , the indication of light curve variation on the descending branch suggested by the calar alto data may not be significant .      * v67 * : our best period is somewhat shorter than s65 adopted period , as expected from the negative parabolic shape of the o - c curve .",
    "the star shows indications of a variable light curve , although the variations in our data do not look as strong as noted by s65 .    * v68 * : double - mode pulsator . the primary period ( 0.47850 ) derived by nc89",
    "does not fit well to our data .",
    "our best - fit period ( 0.355634 ) is more similar to the secondary period found by nc89 ( 0.355978 ) .",
    "the difference is significant .",
    "the overtone periods derived from previous data sets are 0.355978 for data taken in the 1920s ( nc89 ) , 0.355974 for data taken in the 1940s ( martin 1942 ) , and 0.355973 for data taken in the 1950s ( goranskij 1981 ) .",
    "when compared to this study with p=0.355634 for data taken in the 1990s , this seems to indicate a decrease .    * v69 * : in agreement with the positive parabolic shape of the o - c curve , the period that best fits to our data is slightly longer than in s65 .",
    "the variable could be resolved from its close companion in our photometry , and the light curves are very well defined with small scatter .",
    "* v70 * : the old data for this variable have been recently reanalysed by nc89 , who derived a period 0.486085 and suggested this is a fundamental pulsator with unusually small amplitude . our data do not provide a good light curve with nc89 s period ; we have derived a slightly longer period ( 0.486554 ) and the shape of the light curve is sinusoidal with a v amplitude about 0.35 mag , rather typical of a bailey type - c variable .",
