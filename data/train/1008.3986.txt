    "the volume of @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 the volume and its various versions have recently played a crucial role in several important developments in higher dimensional geometry , e.g. @xcite , @xcite .    in the classical setting of ample divisors ,",
    "the volume of @xmath2 is simply its top self - intersection . starting with the work of fujita @xcite , nakayama @xcite , and tsuji @xcite , it became gradually clear that the volume of big divisors  that is , ones with @xmath4  displays a surprising number of properties analogous to that of ample ones .",
    "notably , it depends only on the numerical class of @xmath2 , it is homogeneous of degree @xmath1 , and satisfies a lipschitz - type property ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2.c ) ) .",
    "consequently , one can extend the volume to a continuous function @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nron ",
    "severi group of numerical equivalence classes of cartier divisors on @xmath0 , and by @xmath7 we mean the finite - dimensional real vector space of numerical equivalence classes of @xmath8-divisors .",
    "besides continuity and homogeneity , another important feature of the volume function is log - concavity of degree @xmath1 , i.e. for any two classes @xmath9 we have @xmath10 given a sufficient amount of information , the volume function associated to a variety can be explicitly computed under special circumstances .",
    "examples include all smooth surfaces , toric varieties , and homogeneous spaces .",
    "however , beside what has been mentioned above , relatively little is known about its global behavior , and understanding it more clearly remains a very important quest . in any direction . ]    in @xcite , lazarsfeld and musta showed that in fact most of the properties of @xmath11 are quite formal in nature , and their validity can be extended to the non - complete multigraded setting .",
    "specifically , fix cartier divisors @xmath12 on @xmath0 ( where @xmath13 is an arbitrary positive integer for the time being , but soon it will be @xmath14 ) , and write @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "a multigraded linear series @xmath17 on @xmath0 associated to @xmath12 consists of subspaces @xmath18 such that @xmath19 is a subalgebra of the section ring @xmath20 the support of @xmath17 is the closed convex cone in @xmath21 spanned by all multi - indices @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . given @xmath24 , set @xmath25 exactly as in the complete case , the above assignment defines the volume function of @xmath17 @xmath26 based on earlier work of okounkov , @xcite and @xcite , the authors of @xcite associate a convex cone  the so - called okounkov cone  to a multigraded linear series on a projective variety . with the help of convex geometry and semigroup",
    "theory they show that ( under very mild hypotheses ) the formal properties of the global volume function persist in the multigraded setting .",
    "precisely as in the global case , the function @xmath27 extends uniquely to a continuous function @xmath28 which is homogeneous , log - concave of degree @xmath1 , and extends continuously to the entire @xmath29 , ( cf .",
    "remark  [ extension ] ) .",

    "moreover we have @xmath38 .    as a consequence ,",
    "we observe that the volume function @xmath39 of a multigraded linear series @xmath17 can be pretty wild .",
    "to support this claim , let us point out the following connection .",
    "alexandroff  @xcite showed that a function as in theorem a is almost everywhere twice differentiable ; at the same time , one can give examples of functions of this sort , which are nowhere three times differentiable ( cf .",
    "remark  [ nowhere differentiable ] ) .",
    "this gives a positive answer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 7.2 ) . as for the proof of theorem a , the linear series we construct lives on a smooth projective toric variety @xmath0 of dimension @xmath1 and picard number @xmath13 .    for the proof of theorem",
    "a we first check that any pointed cone in @xmath40 , modulo shrinking , is the okounkov cone of some multigraded linear series on @xmath0 .",
    "this will show further that the volume of the linear series is the same as the euclidean volume function of slices of its okounkov cone .",
    "we finish by verifying that any function as in theorem a is the euclidean volume function of a cone .",
    "it follows from theorem a that there exist uncountably many volume functions in the non - complete case . in comparison ,",
    "in the complete case we prove that in fact there are only countably many of them :    [ theorem b ] let @xmath41 be a lattice inside the vector space @xmath42 .",
    "then there exist countably many functions @xmath43 with @xmath44 , so that for any irreducible projective variety @xmath0 of dimension @xmath1 and picard number @xmath13 , we can construct an integral linear isomorphism @xmath45 with the property that @xmath46 for some @xmath44 .",
    "we prove theorem b in the case of smooth varieties , from which the general case follows easily by appealing to resolution of singularities .",
    "the heart of the proof is a careful analysis of the variation of the volume function in families coming from multi - graded hilbert schemes .",
    "this approach will also help us to establish the analogous statement for the ample , nef , big , and pseudoeffective cones .",
    "we would like to point out that the claim regarding the countability of ample or nef cones also follows from the work of campana and peternell @xcite on the algebraicity of the ample cone .",
    "an amusing application of theorem b concerns the set of volumes @xmath47 , which is the set of all non - negative real numbers arising as the volume of a cartier divisor on some irreducible projective variety . using theorem b",
    ", one can deduce that @xmath48 has the structure of a countable multiplicative semigroup ( cf .",
    "remark [ semigroup of volumes ] ) .",
    "by contrast , in the last section we give an example of a four - fold whose volume function is given by a transcendental function , deepening further the mystery surrounding the volume function in the classical case .",
    "in particular , the same example provides a cartier divisor with transcendental volume , thus the set of volumes @xmath48 contains also transcendental numbers .",
    "the transcendental nature of the volume function in a geometrically simple situation leads to a new relation linking complex geometry to diophantine questions . in their inspiring work @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , kontsevich and zagier make a strong argument for the concept of a _",
    "period_. according to their definition , a complex number @xmath49 is a period , if it can be written as the integral of a rational function with rational coefficients over an algebraic domain ( a subset or euclidean space determined by polynomial inequalities with rational coefficients ) .    by their very definition , periods are countable in number , and contain all algebraic numbers .",
    "on the other hand , various transcendental numbers manifestly belong to this circle , @xmath50 or the natural logarithms of positive integers among them .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that periods form a ring with respect to the usual operations on real numbers .",
    "although it is obvious from cardinality considerations that most real numbers are not elements of this ring , so far there is not a single real number that has been proved _ not _ to be a period ( although there are notable candidates such as @xmath51 , the base of the natural logarithm ) .    using results of lazarsfeld and musta from @xcite ,",
    "the volume of a cartier divisor @xmath2 can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the okounkov body of @xmath2 with respect to any admissible complete flag @xmath54 of subvarieties in @xmath0 .",
    "this means that @xmath55  originally defined as the asymptotic rate of growth of the number of global sections of multiples of @xmath2  is a period in a very natural way , whenever @xmath53 is an algebraic domain for some suitably chosen admissible flag .",
    "this happens in all the cases that have been explicitly computed so far , leading to the following question .",
    "is the volume of an integral cartier divisor on an irreducible projective variety always a period ?",
    "part of this work was done while the first and the second authors were enjoying the hospitality of the universit joseph fourier in grenoble .",
    "we would like to use this opportunity to thank michel brion and the department of mathematics for the invitation .",
    "we are grateful to sebastien boucksom , rob lazarsfeld , and mircea musta for many helpful discussions .",
    "in this section we study the volume function of a multigraded linear series and verify that any non - zero continuous homogeneous log - concave function appears ( modulo compressing ) as the volume function of some multigraded linear series on a smooth projective toric variety of dimension @xmath1 and picard number @xmath13 .",
    "first we introduce some notation .",
    "in course of this section @xmath0 will be a smooth projective toric variety of dimension @xmath1 , corresponding to a fan @xmath56 in @xmath57 , so that the torus @xmath58 acts on @xmath0 .",
