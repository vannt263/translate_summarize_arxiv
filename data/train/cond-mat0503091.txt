    "lattice strain may be caused by lattice defects or heteroepitaxy or other kind of stresses .",
    "knowing the strain distribution would result in tailoring the optical and electrical properties like the materials used in band gap engineering . in iii - v compound semiconductors",
    "the strain is very sensitive to the composition of two semiconductor layers and band gap can be tailored by varying the strain between the layers @xcite . the coherent island growth in the epitaxial film growth ( known as s - k growth mode ) is known to be due to the strain relaxation in the growing film after an initial wetting layer @xcite .",
    "hence , the degree of strain relaxation could be one of the main governing factors in coherent island growth .",
    "strain measurement for individual islands would help to understand the coherent island growth mechanisms @xcite . in electronic device technology , the presence of localized stress fields at the perimeter of the components of an integrated circuit found to play a negative role in obtaining the required device characteristics @xcite .",

    "it is possible to get from the smaller length scales ( in nanometer scales ) by using special geometries and conditions in the above experimental methods .",
    "for example , it is possible to limit the penetration of x - rays by using grazing incidence methods or using rbs / c in glancing angle geometry .",
    "it is also possible to get strain in specific locations using nanobeam diffraction ( nbd in tem ) or convergent beam diffraction ( cbed in tem ) or lattice imaging ( hrtem ) .    among the x - ray methods , high resolution xrd or rocking curves",
    "is a common method to determine the strain distribution in single crystalline samples .",
    "the strain component is derived by simulating the rocking curves with a model distribution of strains and by using dynamical theory formalism based on takagi - toupin formalism @xcite .",
    "the rocking curve measurements have been carried out in grazing incidence geometry so as to make the method surface- sensitive . using this technique , known as asymmetric bragg - rocking curves",
    ", one can quantitatively determine the strain by measuring the bulk reflection under the grazing conditions @xcite .",

    "kishino et al .",
    ", @xcite extended the dynamical diffraction theory derived by battermann and cole @xcite to the case of grazing incidence .",
    "hasegawa et al . , found the width of the rocking curve for ( 311 ) reflection depends on the width of the oxide layer thickness and reported strain field distribution at sio@xmath1/si(001 ) interface using the asymmetric bragg reflection method @xcite .",
    "the x - ray methods are useful when the specimen under study remains mostly crystalline .",
    "the aforementioned x - ray methods give the information on integrated signal through the depth along which x - rays have penetrated .",
    "similarly , rutherford backscattering spectrometry / channeling ( rbs / c ) is method to measure tetragonal strain in the single crystalline systems .",
    "the rbs / c methods has been used to determine the tetragonal strain at cosi@xmath1/si(111 ) interface by using axial channeling conditions .",
    "previously , by combining hrxrd ( which was used to determine the strain component perpendicular to the surface normal ) and rbs / c ( which was used to determine the tetragonal strain ) , the in - plane strain component at cosi@xmath1/si(111 ) interface had been obtained @xcite .",
    "rbs / c experimental method also represents an integrated strain component .    using tem , both imaging mode ( i.e. , image contrast and lattice imaging ) and diffraction mode ( selected area diffraction ( sad ) , nano - beam diffraction ( nbd ) and large angle convergent beam diffraction ( cbed ) ) have been exploited for the strain determination @xcite .",

    "damage induced by ion irradiation in si depends on fluence , flux , energy , mass of the ion , target temperature , impact angle etc .",
    "understanding the amorphization process is still an active area of research and various mechanisms have been put forward @xcite .",
    "j. kamila et al . , reported that onset of amorphization due to mev au ion implantation in silicon occurs at lower fluence for low incident ion currents @xcite .",

    "but with the ag islands , the strain in si surface is found to be negligible and found to retain its crystalline structure even at larger fluences .",

    "however the projected range of au ions in ag ( @xmath3 130 nm calculated from trim @xcite ) much greater than the average height of the ag islands ( @xmath2517 nm ) .",

    "the appearance of oscillations ( or satellite peaks ) arises either due to strain or due to the presence of a very thin layer of different electron density from the substrate matrix .",
