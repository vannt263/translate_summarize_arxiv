    "the lotka - volterra system has been widely investigated in the last years .",
    "this system , studied by may and leonard @xcite , models the evolution of competition between three species . among the studied topics related with the lotka - volterra system , we recall a few of them together with a partial list of references , namely : integrals and invariant manifolds ( @xcite , @xcite ) , stability ( @xcite , @xcite ) , analytic behavior @xcite , nonlinear analysis @xcite , and many others .",
    "in this paper we consider a special case of the lotka - volterra system , recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "we write the system as a hamiltonian system of poisson type in order to analyze the system from the poisson dynamics point of view .",
    "more exactly , in the second section of this paper , we prepare the framework of our study by writing the lotka - volterra system as a hamilton - poisson system , and also find a @xmath0 parameterized family of hamilton - poisson realizations .",
    "as consequence of the hamiltonian setting we obtain two new first integrals of the lotka - volterra system that generates the first integrals of this system found in @xcite . in the third section of the paper",
    "we determine the equilibria of the lotka - volterra system and then analyze their lyapunov stability .",
    "the fourth section is dedicated to the study of the poincar compactification of the lotka - volterra system .",
    "more exactly , we integrate explicitly the poincar compactification of the lotka - volterra system . in the fifth section of the article we present some convexity properties of the image of the energy - casimir mapping and define some naturally associated semialgebraic splittings of the image .",
    "more precisely , we discuss the relation between the image through the energy - casimir mapping of the families of equilibria of the lotka - volterra system and the canonical whitney stratifications of the semialgebraic splittings of the image of the energy - casimir mapping . in the sixth part of the paper",
    "we give a topological classification of the fibers of the energy - casimir mapping , classification that follows naturally from the stratifications introduced in the above section .",
    "note that in our approach we consider fibers over the regular and also over the singular values of the energy - casimir mapping . in the last part of the article we give two lax formulations of the system . for details on poisson geometry and hamiltonian dynamics",

    "these conservation laws will be represented by the hamiltonian and respectively a casimir function of the poisson configuration manifold of the system .    as the purpose of this paper is to study the above system from the poisson dynamics point of view , the first step in this approach is to give a hamilton - poisson realization of the system .",

    "[ t33 ] all the equilibrium states of the lotka - volterra system are unstable .",
    "the conclusion follows from the fact that the characteristic polynomial associated with the linear part of the system evaluated at an arbitrary equilibrium state , is the same for any of the families @xmath39 , and is given by : @xmath40 for @xmath41 , we get the origin @xmath42 which is also unstable since in any arbitrary small open neighborhood around , there exists unstable equilibrium states .",

    "hence , for each @xmath53 , the flow of the system on the local chart @xmath52 is the same as the flow on the local chart @xmath51 reversing the time .",
    "the system is integrable with the solution given by    @xmath63    where @xmath64 are arbitrary real constants .    to analyze the lotka - volterra system on the sphere @xmath44 at infinity , note that the points on the sphere at infinity are characterized by @xmath65 .",
