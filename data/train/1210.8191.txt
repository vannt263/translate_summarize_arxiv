    "key component of a multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) communication system in terms of performance and complexity is the mimo detector , which is used for separating independent data streams at the receiver .",
    "the maximum likelihood ( ml ) detectors achieve the optimal error rate performance . however , these types of detectors , including the near - optimal sphere decoder and its variants , are usually not suitable for practical systems due to their high complexity .",
    "linear detectors , such as zero - forcing ( zf ) and mmse , achieve suboptimal performance , however , they are widely used in practical systems due to their low complexity implementations . among linear receivers , mmse is the optimal solution and seems to be the mainstream implementation choice due to its superior performance over zf detectors .",
    "perfect channel state information ( csi ) is usually assumed in the literature when simulating or analyzing the performance of linear detectors @xcite .",
    "however , in practice the channel estimates are inherently noisy .",
    "important work @xcite , @xcite has characterized the error rate performance of zf receivers in the presence of channel estimation error .",
    "nevertheless , less is known for the case of mmse detectors in practical scenarios . for zf and mmse receivers , the joint effect of phase noise and channel estimation error",
    "is considered in @xcite and the performance is analyzed in terms of the degradation in signal - to - noise - plus - interference - ratio ( sinr ) without expressing the closed form performance indicators or error rate analysis .",
    "the sinr derivations for the mmse case in @xcite are done only for low snr region . in both @xcite and @xcite , channel estimation error variance",
    "is assumed to be constant for all snrs .",
    "this is not realistic approach for packet based or bursty communication systems as the channel estimation error is in fact a function of the snr . in this letter",
    ", we analyze the mmse receivers in the presence of channel estimation error , and derive a closed form post - processing snr expression , which provides an accurate estimate of the error rate performance .",
    "the error rate performance is investigated for both the constant channel estimation error variance case and the case with a realistic channel estimation algorithm where the estimation error variance is clearly dependent on the channel snr .",
    "we believe that it is a very useful tool for throughput prediction in link adaptation protocols and for error rate analysis in general .",
    "accuracy of the analytical results is verified through simulations .",
    "we consider a mimo system where the transmitter is equipped with @xmath0 antennas , and the receiver uses @xmath1 antennas .",

    "@xmath16    the ppsnr is a good indicator for the error rate performance of mimo systems , and therefore employed in link adaptation algorithms to predict the uncoded error rate @xcite .",
    "since the output of the mmse detector is gaussian , the bit error rate of a specific modulation can be calculated by simply plugging the ppsnr value into the awgn error rate formula of the modulation .",
    "the same technique is also used for theoretical derivation of error rate performance in fading channels .",
    "this definition of ppsnr holds if the channel is perfectly known at the receiver .",
    "however , in practice , the channel matrix has to be estimated by the receiver , and the estimated channel is inherently noisy in practical systems .",
    "we model the estimated channel matrix as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the estimation error matrix which is uncorrelated with @xmath6 , and its entries are zmcscg with variance @xmath19 .",
    "the quality of channel estimation is captured by @xmath19 , which can be appropriately estimated depending on the channel estimation method .",
    "we assume that each block ( packet ) , that undergoes a specific channel realization , @xmath6 , observes a different realization of @xmath18 at the receiver .",
    "this situation occurs in packet based communication systems like 802.11n where the channel is estimated on a per packet basis .      in this section",

    "now , the mmse estimate of the signal vector becomes @xmath23 we observe that there are additional interference and noise terms caused by @xmath24 , and denote the post detection noise as @xmath25 . with this definition for the post detection noise , the ppsnr of the @xmath14 spatial stream in the presence of channel estimation error can be expressed as @xmath26\\right)_{k , k}}\\ ] ] where we replaced the original noise covariance in with the covariance of @xmath27 , which is calculated as    rcl [ cov ] e&=&e+e + & & + e+e + & & + e    in order to calculate the terms in , we need to first derive @xmath24 . for small @xmath19 ,",

    "[ bpsk_all_latex3 ] and fig .",

    "for bpsk @xmath66 , and @xmath67 configurations the analysis results are upper - bounds to the real performance at high snr , however , they are still very close to the real performances .",
    "the analysis results become tighter for higher order modulations and higher order mimo configurations .",
    "this is because of the fact that the gaussian assumption , which is made for the post - detection noise , is more valid at higher order modulations and mimo configurations . at low snrs ,",
    "the total post detection noise @xmath27 is dominated by the additive white gaussian noise component @xmath8 therefore the assumption is valid even for lower configurations .",
    "however , at high snrs the residual interference components from other spatial streams becomes dominant and @xmath27 is loosely approximated as gaussian for lower order constellations and mimo configurations .",
    "it is interesting to note that in contrast to the results obtained for zf detector by @xcite , we do not observe any error floor on the performance .",
    "this is due to the fact that the channel estimation error variance @xmath19 for ml estimation gets smaller as snr increases .",
    "this is the situation that occurs in practical packet based or bursty communication systems where the channel estimation is performed for every packet prior to data detection , and hence experiences the same noise variance as the data transmission .",
    "therefore the channel estimation quality is dependent on the snr . on the other hand ,",
    "error floors are observed in @xcite because of the assumption that @xmath19 remains constant independent of the snr .",
    "this case is investigated below in _ case 2_.    _ case 2 : _ in addition to ml channel estimation results , we also performed simulations with constant @xmath70 . unlike the first case ,",
    "the channel estimation quality is independent of the snr .",
    "this situation might arise either when there is a ready channel estimate to be used by the receiver formed elsewhere with a different additive noise variance , or the channel estimation is outdated and the major error in the channel estimation comes from the mobility changes in the channel .    in fig .",
    "[ qpsk ] , the ber performance of a qpsk @xmath71 system is investigated for @xmath72 using the estimation error model in ( 4 ) .",
    "each packet observes a different realization of the random matrix @xmath18 with the designated variance @xmath19 . as expected , we observe error floor in the performance due to the constant estimation error variance as in the zf detector case studied in @xcite .",
    "more importantly , these error floors are the same as the ones observed by zf detector because of the fact that the mmse and zf detectors exhibit the same behaviour at asymptotically high snr .",
    "the simulation results in this case also agree with the analysis .",
