    "a well known result in the global theory for proper minimal surfaces in the euclidean @xmath6-space is the so called _ half - space theorem _ due to hoffman and meeks @xcite , which says that if a properly immersed minimal surface @xmath7 in @xmath8 lies on one side of some plane @xmath9 then @xmath7 is a plane parallel to @xmath10 moreover , they also proved the _ strong half - space theorem _ : two properly immersed minimal surfaces in @xmath8 that do not intersect must be parallel planes .",
    "the problem of giving conditions which force two minimal surfaces of a riemannian manifold to intersect has received considerable attention , and many people have worked on this subject .",
    "notice that there is no half - space theorem in euclidean spaces of dimensions greater than @xmath11 since there exist rotational proper minimal hypersurfaces contained in a slab .",
    "similarly , there exists no half - space theorem for horizontal slices in @xmath12 since rotational minimal surfaces ( catenoids ) are contained in a slab @xcite .",
    "however , there are half - space theorems for constant mean curvature ( cmc ) @xmath13 surfaces in @xmath12 @xcite . for instance",
    ", hauswirth , rosenberg , and spruck @xcite proved that if @xmath7 is a properly immersed cmc @xmath13 surface in @xmath14 contained on the mean convex side of a horocylinder @xmath15 then @xmath7 is a horocylinder parallel to @xmath16 and if @xmath7 is embedded and contains a horocylinder @xmath17 on its mean convex side , then @xmath7 is also a horocylinder parallel to @xmath17 . nelli and sa earp @xcite showed that in @xmath12 the mean convex side of a simply connected rotational cmc @xmath13 surface can not contain a complete cmc @xmath13 surface besides the rotational simply connected ones .",
    "other examples of homogeneous manifolds where there are half - space theorems for minimal surfaces are nil@xmath18 and sol@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "for instance , we know that if a properly immersed minimal surface @xmath7 in nil@xmath18 lies on one side of some entire minimal graph @xmath19 then @xmath7 is the image of @xmath4 by a vertical translation .",
    "mazet @xcite proved a general half - space theorem for constant mean curvature surfaces . under certain hypothesis",
    ", he proved that in a riemannian @xmath6-manifold of bounded geometry , a constant mean curvature @xmath20 surface on one side of a parabolic constant mean curvature @xmath20 surface @xmath4 is an equidistant surface to @xmath5    in this paper , we consider the half - space problem for an ideal scherk graph @xmath4 over a polygonal domain @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes a hadamard surface whose curvature is bounded above by a negative constant , that is , @xmath2 is a complete simply connected riemannian surface with curvature @xmath21 for some constant @xmath22 more precisely , we prove the following result .",
    "let @xmath2 denote a hadamard surface with curvature bounded above by a negative constant , and let @xmath23 be an ideal scherk graph over an admissible polygonal domain @xmath24 if @xmath7 is a properly immersed minimal surface contained in @xmath3 and disjoint from @xmath19 then @xmath7 is a translate of @xmath5    we remark that mazet s theorem does not apply in our case for scherk surfaces . in fact , in the case of minimal surfaces , one of his hypotheses on the geometry of equidistant surfaces to the parabolic one is that the mean curvature points away from the original surface .",
    "however , since an end of a scherk surface is asymptotic to some vertical plane @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a geodesic , we know that an equidistant surface is asymptotic to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an equidistant curve to @xmath29 hence , in the case of a scherk surface , the mean curvature vector of an equidistant surface points toward the scherk surface .",
    "in this section , we present some basic properties of hadamard manifolds and state some previous results . for more details , see @xcite or @xcite .    let @xmath2 be a hadamard manifold , that is , a complete simply connected riemannian manifold with non positive sectional curvature .",
    "we say that two geodesics @xmath30 of @xmath2 , parameterized by arc length , are _ asymptotic _ if there exists a constant @xmath31 such that the distance between them satisfies @xmath32 note that to be asymptotic is an equivalence relation on the oriented unit speed geodesics of @xmath33 we call each of these classes a point at infinity .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the set of points at infinity and by @xmath35 the equivalence class of the geodesic @xmath29 throughout this section , we only consider oriented unit speed geodesics .",
    "let us assume that @xmath2 has sectional curvature bounded from above by a negative constant .",
    "then we have two important facts :    1 .",
    "for any two asymptotic geodesics @xmath36 the distance between the two curves @xmath37 is zero for any @xmath38 2 .   given @xmath39 , @xmath40 there exists a unique geodesic @xmath26 such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the corresponding point at infinity when the orientation of @xmath26 is changed .",
    "for any point @xmath44 there is a bijective correspondence between the set of unit vectors in the tangent plane @xmath45 and @xmath46 where a unit vector @xmath47 is mapped to the point at infinity @xmath48 @xmath49 denoting the geodesic with @xmath50 and @xmath51 analogously , given a point @xmath52 and a point at infinity @xmath53 there exists a unique geodesic @xmath26 such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 in particular , @xmath34 is bijective to a sphere .",
