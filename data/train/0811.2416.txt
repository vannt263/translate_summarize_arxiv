    "over the past years , significant progress in some of the central phenomenological problems of string theory compactifications has been made .",
    "these problems include , in particular , moduli stabilisation , susy breaking , inflation and the possibility of fine - tuning the cosmological constant in the landscape of flux vacua .",
    "much of this has been realised most successfully and explicitly in type iib calabi ",
    "yau orientifold models in the supergravity regime ( for reviews , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , obtaining the standard model particle spectrum remains difficult in this context , although successful local constructions exist@xcite .",
    "motivated by the desire to make progress towards a type iib ( or , more generally , f - theory ) derivation of the standard model , the present paper analyses the way in which fluxes determine d7 brane positions .",
    "this is central to weakly coupled type iib models , where d7 brane stacks and their intersections are responsible for non - abelian gauge symmetries and charged matter .",
    "we approach such compactifications from the f - theory perspective @xcite , where the value of the type iib dilaton is encoded in the complex structure of a torus attached to every point of the type iib manifold .",
    "d7 branes are characterised by the degeneration loci of this torus fibration and non - abelian gauge symmetries arise if the degeneration is so bad that the 8d compact space develops a singularity .",
    "such singularities are associated with the shrinking of m - theory cycles , which is easy to ensure by the flux choice .",
    "in addition , in weakly coupled situations , the periods of m - theory cycles measure the relative positions of d7 branes .    working in the simple setting of f - theory on @xmath0 ( which corresponds to type iib on @xmath3 ) ,",
    "we are able to demonstrate how fluxes stabilise d7 branes or stacks of d7 branes in a completely explicit fashion .",
    "this allows us to select a specific desired gauge group by the choice of flux numbers . as explained above",
    ", this is the same procedure required for the flux stabilisation of non - abelian gauge symmetries in the ( non - perturbative ) f - theory context , which has recently attracted significant attention in the context of gut model building @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that straightforward generalisations of our methods will be useful both for more complicated d7 brane models as well as for their non - perturbative f - theory cousins .",
    "moduli stabilisation by fluxes in m - theory on @xmath0 has been studied extensively in the past , especially in relation with the type iib dual ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . in our work",
    "we derive the flux potential for the geometric moduli from dimensional reduction .",
    "we express it in a form manifestly invariant under the @xmath4 symmetry of the @xmath2 moduli space . in this form",
    ", it is immediate to see how the minimisation condition is translated into a condition on fluxes and on geometric data of the two @xmath2 s .",
    "we find all minkowski minima , both supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric . an analogous explicit search for ( supersymmetric )",
    "flux vacua has been reported in  @xcite .",
    "our results are more general since we do not restrict ourselves to attractive @xmath2 surfaces , where a maximal number of integral 2-cycles are holomorphic .",
    "our analysis of moduli stabilisation is also more explicit than the previous works on @xmath0 , since we use a parameterisation of d7-brane motion by the size of integral two - cycles , as derived in  @xcite .",
    "thus , at least in the weak coupling limit , we have a simple geometric interpretation for every integral basis cycle . using the choice of flux numbers , this gives us full control over the positions of 4 o7 planes and 16 d7 branes moving on a @xmath5 base ( corresponding to type iib on @xmath1 ) .",
    "our techniques can be used to study the stabilisation of all the gauge groups that can be realised by f - theory on @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that tadpole cancellation is very restrictive and allows only very special flux choices .",
    "we begin our analysis in section  2 with a derivation of the @xmath0 flux potential , which closely follows the generic calabi - yau derivation of  @xcite .",
    "we emphasise the fact that , due to the hyper - khler structure of @xmath2 , its geometric moduli space can be visualised by the motion of a three - plane in the 22-dimensional space of homology classes of two - cycles .",
    "this three - plane is spanned by the real and imaginary parts of the holomorphic 2-form and by the khler form .",
    "the resulting @xmath4 symmetry of the geometric moduli is manifest in the expression for the scalar potential we arrive at .",
    "the three - dimensional theory also has a number of gauge fields , and the flux induces mass terms for some of them , which we derive explicitly .",
    "this breaking of gauge symmetries can be understood in the dual type  iib picture as the gauging of some shift symmetry in the flux background .    in section  3",
    "we analyse the minima of the above flux potential . to preserve four - dimensional poincar invariance",
    ", we consider 4-form fluxes that belong to @xmath6 .",
    "a flux of this form gives rise to a linear map between the spaces of two - cycles of the two @xmath2 s : integrating the flux on a 2-cycle of one @xmath2 we get a 2-form on the other @xmath2 ( which is poincar dual to a 2-cycle ) .",
    "minkowski vacua arise if the flux maps the three - planes determining the metric of the @xmath2 s onto each other .",
    "we derive the conditions the flux matrix has to satisfy in order for two such planes to exist and to be completely fixed by the choice of fluxes .",
    "furthermore , we clarify the more restrictive conditions under which the plane determined by the flux is consistent with the f - theory limit . in this case , the plane can not be fixed completely .",
    "the unfixed moduli correspond to wilson lines around the @xmath7 of the type iib model which decompactifies in the f - theory limit .",
    "these degrees of freedom are not part of the moduli space of type  iib compactified to four dimensions , as they characterise the ( unphysical ) constant background value of one component of the four - dimensional vector fields .",
    "in fact , the corresponding propagating degrees of freedom become part of the four - dimensional vector fields ( see  @xcite for a comprehensive analysis of the duality map between the 4d fields of m - theory on @xmath0 and type iib string theory on @xmath3 ) .    the main point of our paper",
    ", the explicit stabilisation of d - brane positions , is the subject of section  4 . after recalling the parameterisation of d7-brane motion in terms of m - theory cycles derived in  @xcite",
    ", we provide explicit examples of flux matrices which fix situations with gauge symmetries @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in all cases",
    "we also fix the complex structure moduli of the lower @xmath2 .",
    "the first case corresponds to the orientifold , where 4 d7 branes lie on top of each o7 plane . in the second case ,",
    "one d7  brane is moved away from an o  plane . finally , in the third case",
    ", a stack of two d7  branes is separated from one of the o  planes . in these examples",
    "almost all the khler moduli ( which correspond to deformations of the lower @xmath2 and do not affect the positions of the d7 branes ) are not stabilised .",
    "when one of them is stabilised , a khler modulus of the upper @xmath2 is stabilised , too . as mentioned before",
    ", this corresponds to some gauge field becoming massive . to clarify this point , we present two examples where one of the d7 branes is fixed at a certain distance from its o  plane : in the first example , one further khler modulus is fixed , breaking the @xmath11 gauge group .",
    "this phenomenon of gauging by fluxes is common in flux compactifications@xcite . in the second example , we stabilise the single d7 brane without fixing further khler moduli and hence without gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "we also provide an example where almost all moduli are fixed . in this case , only the fibre volume of f - theory , the volume moduli of the two @xmath2s , and three metric moduli of the lower @xmath2 remain undetermined .",
    "section  5 contains a brief discussion of supersymmetry .",
    "generically , we obtain @xmath12 vacua of no - scale type . for specific , non - generic choices of the flux matrix",
    ", we find three - dimensional @xmath13 or @xmath14 supersymmetry . to determine the amount of surviving supersymmetry",
    ", it suffices to know the eigenvalues of the flux matrix restricted to the two three - planes .",
    "after summarizing our main results in section  6 , we collect some technical issues in the appendices .",
    "appendix  [ sec : k3 ] contains some basic definitions concerning the geometry of @xmath2 , appendix  [ vwwhat ] gives the flux potential in terms of the two superpotentials of m - theory compactifications .",
    "some facts about self - adjoint operators on spaces with indefinite metric are collected in appendix  [ app : linalg ] .",
    "finally , appendix  [ ftheorypoint ] supplies some further details concerning the f - theory limit , especially the way in which certain m - theory moduli are lost in the f - theory limit .",
    "in this chapter we compactify m - theory to three dimensions on @xmath0 and analyse the effects of four - form flux .",
    "the main new points of our presentation are the following : we maintain a manifest @xmath15 symmetry of the moduli space of @xmath0 in the calculation of the potential in section  [ sec : potential ] .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly derive the flux - induced masses for the vector fields arising from the three - form @xmath16 in section  [ sec : vectormass ] .",
    "the compactification of m - theory on a generic four - fold is described in detail in@xcite .",
    "here we specialise to the case of @xmath0 .",
    "to distinguish the two @xmath2 s , we write the compactification manifold as @xmath17 .",
    "correspondingly , all quantities related to the second @xmath2 will have a tilde .",
    "the relevant m - theory bosonic action is@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the eleven - dimensional planck length , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are polynomials of degree 4 in the curvature tensor @xcite .",
    "when we compactify on @xmath17 , we obtain a three - dimensional theory with eight supercharges , i.e.  @xmath23 in three dimensions .",
    "this can be inferred from the fact that each @xmath2 has holonomy group @xmath24 and correspondingly two invariant spinors .",
    "let us analyse the geometric moduli .",
    "@xmath2 is a hyper - khler manifold : its metric is defined by three two - forms @xmath25 in @xmath26 plus the overall scale .",
    "@xmath27 is a 22-dimensional vector space equipped with a natural scalar product , @xmath28 which has signature @xmath29 , i.e.  there are three positive - norm directions .",
    "the three vectors @xmath25 defining the metric must have positive norm and be orthogonal to each other .",
    "hence they can be normalised according to @xmath30 .",
    "the khler form and holomorphic two - form and can then be given as @xmath31 this definition is not unique : we have an @xmath32 of possible complex structures and associated khler forms .",
    "each of them defines the same metric , which is then invariant under the @xmath4 that rotates the @xmath25 s .",
    "the motion in moduli space can now be visualised as the motion of the three - plane @xmath33 spanned by the @xmath25 s , which is characterised by the deformations of the @xmath25 preserving orthonormality .",
    "the corresponding @xmath34 are in the subspace orthogonal to @xmath33 , which is 19-dimensional . together with the volume , this gives @xmath35 scalars in the moduli space of one @xmath2 .",
    "the same parameterisation can be used for the second @xmath2 , where the corresponding scalars are @xmath36 and the components of @xmath37 .",
    "altogether one finds @xmath38 scalars from the metric on @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath2 has no harmonic one - forms , there are no 3d vectors coming from the metric .",
    "we now allow for an expectation value for the field strength @xmath39 of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) is an integral basis of @xmath43 .",

    "we can also rewrite this potential expressing the projectors through the @xmath90 s : @xmath91 this is again manifestly symmetric under @xmath4 rotations .",
    "the potential can also be expressed in terms of two superpotentials ( see appendix  [ vwwhat ] ) .",

    ".    type  iib theory on @xmath3 contains 16 vectors from gauge theories living on d7 branes and 4 vectors from the reduction of @xmath104 and @xmath105 along one - cycles of @xmath1 . in three dimensions ,",
    "one then has 20 three - dimensional gauge fields and 20 scalars corresponding to wilson lines along the @xmath7 . in the f - theory limit , these scalars combine with the vectors to give the required 20 four - dimensional vector fields .    in m - theory on @xmath53 , vectors arise from the reduction of the three - form @xmath16 along two - cycles in @xmath2 or @xmath95 .",
    "since we are in three dimensions we have the freedom to dualise some of these vectors , treating them as three - dimensional scalars .",
    "to match the type  iib description , the correct choice is to treat only the fields coming from the reduction of @xmath16 on two - cycles of @xmath95 as vectors and type iib on @xmath106 . in m - theory",
    ", we have seven - dimensional vectors associated with two - cycles stretched between the pairs of degeneration loci of the fibre ( which characterise d7 branes ) . in type iib , the corresponding vectors come directly from the d7-brane world - volume theories .",
    "the fact that they are associated with branes rather than with pairs of branes is simply a matter of basis choice in the space of @xmath11s . ] .",
    "this reduction gives 22 vectors in three dimensions .",
    "however , since @xmath95 is elliptically fibred , there are two distinguished two - cycles : the base and the fibre .",
    "they require a special treatment in the f - theory limit and , as a result , three - dimensional vectors arising from these two cycles do not become four - dimensional gauge fields in the f - theory limit .",
    "instead , one of them corresponds to the type  iib metric with one leg on the @xmath7 , while the other is related to @xmath107 with three legs on @xmath108@xcite .",
    "we will not consider these two vectors in the following and focus on the remaining 20 three - dimensional vectors associated with the reduction of @xmath16 on generic two - cycles of @xmath95 .",
    "each of these vectors absorbs a three - dimensional scalar ( corresponding to a wilson line degree of freedom on the type iib side ) to become a four - dimensional vector .",
    "these 20 scalars come from the metric moduli space of @xmath95 .",
    "more precisely , 18 arise from the variations @xmath109 of the khler form in directions orthogonal to the three - plane and to the base - fibre subspace , two directions of the three - plane are orthogonal to base and fibre subspace , while @xmath110 has a component along the base - fibre subspace .",
    "this explains the above number of independent variations as @xmath111 .",
    "the variation of @xmath110 within the base - fibre subspace corresponds to part of the metric in the f - theory limit . ] .",
    "the two remaining scalars come from variations @xmath112 and @xmath113 of the holomorphic two - form which lie in the base - fibre subspace and are orthogonal to @xmath110 . for a detailed analysis of the matching of fields on both sides of the duality ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "given these preliminaries , it is now intuitively clear why f - theory flux generically breaks gauge symmetries : the flux induces a potential for the metric moduli , making them massive .",
    "this applies , in particular , to those moduli which become vector degrees of freedom in four dimensions .",
    "hence , the full four - dimensional vector becomes massive by lorentz invariance .",
    "to derive the vector mass term explicitly , we begin by writing @xmath16 in the form @xmath114 here @xmath63 and @xmath115 are basis two - forms on the @xmath2 factors , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are one - form fields in three dimensions , and @xmath118 is the contribution responsible for the four - form flux ( which is only locally defined ) . as before ,",
    "the flux is given by @xmath119 .",
    "in the reduction of the action , the @xmath120 term leads to the flux term @xmath121 ( which is irrelevant for our present discussion ) and to kinetic terms for @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the metric for the kinetic terms is given by @xmath122 we have split off the volume dependence , so that @xmath123 and @xmath124 are dimensionless .",
    "note that these metrics are positive definite since the subspace orthogonal to the three - plane has negative - definite metric .",
    "note also that there is no kinetic mixing between the @xmath116 and the @xmath117 since @xmath125 .",
    "we now turn to the chern ",
    "simons term @xmath126 . evaluating this term with @xmath16 of the form  ( [ eq : c3kk ] ) , we see that the contribution @xmath127 vanishes : @xmath118 has three legs on @xmath53 , so @xmath128 would need to have three legs on @xmath129 and five legs on @xmath53 .",
    "this is , however , inconsistent with  ( [ eq : c3kk ] ) .",
    "the other contributions give @xmath130 thus , the flux matrix @xmath131 couples @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "we have now arrived at the three - dimensional effective action @xmath134 as explained before , only the vectors @xmath117 become four - dimensional vectors in the f - theory limit@xcite .",
    "it is convenient to dualise the remaining vectors @xmath116 , replacing them by scalars @xmath135 . to this end",
    ", we turn the equation of motion , @xmath136 into a bianchi identity by defining @xmath135 through @xmath137 it follows that the @xmath135 have to transform non - trivially under the gauge transformations of the @xmath117 : @xmath138 in other words , the vectors @xmath117 gauge shift symmetries of the scalars @xmath135 , with the charges determined by the flux .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath135 follows formally from @xmath139 , the bianchi identity of @xmath116 . since @xmath140 on @xmath129 , we find @xmath141 we now want to find a gauge invariant action from which this equation of motion can be derived .",
    "such an action is given by @xmath142 the corresponding einstein - hilbert term has the usual volume prefactor and can be brought to canonical form by a weyl rescaling of the three - dimensional metric .",
    "this gives the kinetic term of the vectors a prefactor @xmath143 , which we can absorb in a redefinition of @xmath117 .",
    "the resulting mass matrix has the form @xmath144 which is positive semidefinite since @xmath145 is a positive definite metric .",
    "the number of gauge fields which become massive is determined by the rank of the flux matrix . comparing with eq .",
    "( [ potentialv ] ) , we see that the masses are of the same order as the masses of the flux stabilised geometric moduli .",
    "this confirms the intuitive idea put forward at the beginning of this section : the vectors @xmath117 and some geometric moduli are combined in the f - theory limit to produce four - dimensional vectors . for this to work in the presence of fluxes ,",
    "both the three - dimensional vectors and scalars need to have the same flux - induced masses .",
    "in this section we turn to the flux stabilisation of moduli .",
    "first , we will analyse under which conditions the potential  ( [ potentialv ] ) has minima at @xmath89 , and whether there are flat directions .",
    "then we will see which restrictions we have to impose in order to map the m - theory situation to f - theory , and discuss possible implications for gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "let us first comment on the flux components which are proportional to the volume forms . in what follows , we do not consider these components , in other words , we set @xmath146 .",
    "the reason is that we want to end up with a lorentz - invariant four - dimensional theory . by going through the m - theory / f - theory duality explicitly",
    ", one can see that this requires that the flux needs to have exactly one leg in the fibre torus and hence two legs along each @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we can without loss of generality use a flux in the form of eq .",
    "( [ 4formflux ] ) , and the associated potential  ( [ potentialv ] ) .",
    "clearly , the potential  ( [ potentialv ] ) can not stabilise the volumes @xmath147 and @xmath36 .",
    "they are runaway directions in general , and flat directions exactly if the term in brackets vanishes .",
    "this term is a sum of positive definite terms , so each of these must vanish if we want to realise a minimum with vanishing energy .",
    "since each term contains a projection onto the subspace orthogonal to the three - planes spanned by the @xmath25 s and @xmath86 s , the bracket clearly vanishes if and only if the flux homomorphisms map the three - planes into each other , though not necessarily bijectively : @xmath148 note that what is required is not merely the existence of three - dimensional subspaces which are mapped to each other , but that both subspaces are positive - norm .",
    "if the metrics were positive definite , this condition would be trivial since any real matrix can be diagonalised by choosing appropriate bases in @xmath27 and @xmath149 .",
    "we will now show that the conditions   are equivalent to the conditions that the map @xmath150 is diagonalisable and all its eigenvalues are real and non - negative maps @xmath149 onto itself , so it makes sense to speak of eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "note also , however , that although @xmath150 is a selfadjoint operator , this does not imply that its eigenvalues are real since the metric is indefinite .",
    "we have collected some facts about linear algebra on spaces with indefinite metric in appendix  [ app : linalg ] . ] .",
    "let us assume that there exist two three - planes @xmath33 and @xmath151 such that the relations hold .",
    "the cohomology groups can be decomposed into orthogonal subspaces , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , such that the metric defined by the wedge product is positive ( negative ) definite on @xmath33 and @xmath151 ( @xmath154 and @xmath155 ) .",
    "the conditions  ( [ eq : planetoplane ] ) imply that @xmath81 and @xmath80 are block - diagonal , i.e.  we also have @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "it is then obvious that the selfadjoint operator @xmath158 obeys obeys @xmath159 . ]",

    "to summarise , the conditions  ( [ eq : planetoplane ] ) are equivalent to the condition that @xmath150 is diagonalisable and all its eigenvalues are real and non - negative . in this case",
    "( see appendix  [ app : linalg ] ) the matrices for @xmath158 , @xmath81 and @xmath80 take the form @xmath173 in appropriate bases , where @xmath174 are the eigenvalues of @xmath158 relative to positive norm eigenvectors , while @xmath175 are relative to negative norm eigenvectors .",
    "finally , we want to see whether there are flat directions .",
    "the potential has a flat direction , if there are infinitesimally different positions of the three - planes @xmath176 which give minkowski minima .",
    "given a flux ( such that @xmath158 is diagonalizable with positive eigenvalues ) , the minima correspond to @xmath151 ( @xmath33 ) generated by the positive norm eigenvectors of @xmath158 ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "if all the eigenvalues are different from each other , there can be only three positive norm eigenvectors , and the minimum is isolated .",
    "if a positive norm and a negative norm eigenvector have the same eigenvalue , e.g. @xmath178 , then a flat direction arises : any three - dimensional space spanned by @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) will give a different @xmath151 that still satisfies the conditions .",
    "it is easy to see that an analogous flat direction develops for @xmath33 .",
    "note that if some @xmath183 are degenerate then the rotation of the vectors does not move the three - planes .",
    "this shows that flat directions of the potential are absent if and only if the sets of eigenvalues @xmath184 and @xmath185 are pairwise distinct .",
    "we are interested in stabilising points in the moduli space of @xmath17 which can be mapped to f - theory .",
    "this means we require that @xmath95 is an elliptic fibration over a base @xmath186 , and that the fibre volume vanishes .",
    "the first requirement means that @xmath95 needs to have two elements @xmath187 ( the base ) and @xmath188 ( the fibre ) in the picard group , i.e.  two integral ( 1,1)-cycles , whose intersection matrix is @xmath189 note that by a change of basis from @xmath190 to @xmath191 , this intersection matrix is equivalent to one @xmath192 block in the general form  ( [ eq : uuue8e8 ] ) of the metric in an integral basis .    as ( 1,1)-cycles , @xmath187 and @xmath188 must be orthogonal to the holomorphic two - form . in our case",
    "this means that the @xmath193 plane has a two - dimensional subspace orthogonal orthogonal to @xmath194 .",
    "this subspace is spanned by the real and imaginary part of the holomorphic two - form @xmath195 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath194 contains the third positive - norm direction , so @xmath110 can not be also orthogonal to @xmath194 . for the following discussion it is convenient to consider directly the khler form @xmath196 instead of @xmath36 and @xmath110 separately .",
    "the khler form can be parametrised as @xmath197 where @xmath198 is an orthonormal basis ( i.e.  @xmath199 ) of the space orthogonal to @xmath188 , @xmath187 and @xmath200 .",
    "this is the most general form of @xmath196 for an elliptically fibred @xmath95 .",
    "now we turn to the second requirement : the fibre must have vanishing volume .",
    "this is what is called the _ f - theory limit_. for the khler form  ( [ eq : jtelliptic ] ) , we find the volumes of the fibre and the base to be is given by the projection on the three - plane @xmath33 , multiplied by the @xmath2 volume : @xmath201 ] @xmath202 hence , the f - theory limit involves @xmath203 , and in this limit , the base volume will be given by @xmath204 .",

    "once the limit is taken , the volume of @xmath95 vanishes and the khler form is given by @xmath209 regardless of the initial value of the @xmath206 .",
    "note that the constraint  ( [ eq : caconstraint ] ) is consistent with the intuitive picture of the fibre torus shrinking simultaneously in both directions : the @xmath206 measure the volume of cycles which have one leg in the fibre and one in the base ,",
    "so they shrink like the square root of the fibre volume @xmath210 .    the khler moduli space is reduced in the f - theory limit : we lose not only the direction along which we take the limit , but also all transverse directions except for the base volume @xmath204 , which becomes the single khler modulus of the torus orbifold . in the duality to type iib on @xmath211 , the @xmath206 parametrise wilson lines of the gauge fields along the @xmath7 as long as the fibre volume is finite . in the f - theory limit , which corresponds to the radius of the @xmath7 going to infinity , the wilson lines disappear from the moduli space .",
    "the propapagating degrees of freedom related to them combine with the three - dimensional vectors from the three - form @xmath16 reduced along two - cycles of @xmath95 to form four - dimensional vectors ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : vectormass ] , see also  @xcite ) .    from this perspective",
    ", we see that it is important not to fix the modulus controlling the size of the fibre .",
    "in fact , if we leave it unfixed , we have a line in the m - theory moduli space corresponding to this flat direction of the potential . of this line",
    ", only the point at infinity ( @xmath212 ) corresponds to f - theory .",
    "this limit is singular in the sense that the f - theory point is not strictly speaking in the moduli space of @xmath95 , but on its boundary . as we show in appendix  [ ftheorypoint ] , this point is at infinite distance from every other point in the moduli space of @xmath196 , and it actually corresponds to the decompactification limit in type iib .    to see which fluxes are compatible with this limit , we first note that there must be no flux along either @xmath187 or @xmath188 because lorentz invariance of the four - dimensional theory requires that the flux must have exactly one leg along the fibre .",
    "this means that in a basis of @xmath149 consisting of @xmath187 , @xmath188 and orthogonal forms , the flux matrix must be of the form @xmath213 this leads to a @xmath150 with two rows and columns of zeroes , @xmath214 hence the direction along which we take the f - theory limit is automatically flat .    to discuss the matrix form of @xmath81 ,",

    "this can be understood as follows : we can find certain cycles which measure the distance between branes .",
    "a given brane configuration can thus be characterised by the volumes of such cycles .",

    "the tadpole cancellation condition translates into a condition on the trace of @xmath150 , @xmath221 of course , we also require that the flux gives minkowski minima , i.e.  @xmath158 needs to have only non - negative eigenvalues .",

    "only an @xmath373 subgroup of the @xmath154-symmetry is preserved and we have @xmath392 supersymmetries in three dimensions .",
    "we note that in the case of fluxes which are compatible with the f - theory limit , the condition @xmath382 is always satisfied and so one has simply to check that the other two eigenvalues are equal to each other or possibly zero .",
    "in this paper , we have analysed in detail the stabilisation of d7-brane configurations by fluxes . to do that we have used the f - theory language ,",
    "i.e.  we have studied the stabilisation problem in m - theory and then mapped the results to type iib .",
    "we studied the stabilization of d7/o7 configurations on @xmath289 .",
    "the o7  planes and the d7  branes are wrapped on @xmath2 and localised on @xmath1 ; in particular , the o - planes sit at the four singularities of @xmath1 .",
    "the d7 moduli are the positions of the d7  branes on @xmath1 .",
    "the m - theory dual of this background is given by the compactification on @xmath0 ( in the f - theory limit ) , where the second @xmath2 is elliptically fibred .",
    "our aim was to analyse the moduli stabilisation , in this background , by integral three - form closed string fluxes and by d7 worldvolume two - form fluxes , using f - theory language .",
    "the type iib geometric and d7 moduli are all mapped to m - theory geometric moduli . three - form and two - form fluxes",
    "are both mapped to four - form fluxes .",
    "we have considered m - theory on @xmath0 and derived the four - form flux generated potential for the geometric moduli in the section  [ sec : fluxpotential ] .",
    "we have expressed it in terms of the three orthogonal vectors of @xmath26 that determine the metric of @xmath2 . furthermore , we explictly found the flux - induced mass terms for the vector fields coming from the three - form field . in the section  [ sec : modstab ]",
    "we have worked out in detail the moduli stabilisation , finding the geometric conditions for a flux to minimise the potential : it must map the three - plane of one @xmath2 to the three - plane of the other @xmath2 and back . using the duality",
    ", we can map the stabilised point found in m - theory moduli space to a point in type iib moduli space . in this way we can see which d7 configuration is stabilised by a particular flux .",
    "the m - theory fluxes dual to poincar - symmetry - preserving type iib fluxes do not stabilise the size of the fibre .",
    "so we always have a flat direction in the m - theory moduli space . of this line , only one point corresponds to a four dimensional vacuum , the one associated with zero fibre size .",
    "we have verified that it is at infinite distance from any other point in the moduli space .",
    "the f - theory limit consists in going to this specific point along the flat direction .",
    "we have described this limit in detail in section  [ sec : ftheory ] .",
    "in particular , we have seen which moduli disappear from the m - theory moduli space when we take the f - theory limit .    in section  [ sec : movebrain ] we have studied some examples .",
    "first , we have reviewed the map between the d7 moduli and the dual m - theory geometric dual moduli worked out in @xcite .",
    "this map enabled us to outline an explicit procedure to find a flux that stabilises a desired gauge group via its pattern of shrinking cycles . using this procedure ,",
    "we have shown a flux that stabilises 4  d7  branes on top of each o - plane .",
    "then we have found which fluxes we have to turn on to modify this configuration and move one or two branes away from one o - plane .",
    "this changes the gauge group in type iib .",
    "correspondingly , the flux fixes a different singularity in the upper @xmath2 , i.e.  some cycles are blown up . in the examples we have also checked whether there are some stabilised khler moduli of the lower @xmath2 .",
    "when this is the case , some khler moduli of the upper @xmath2 are stabilised too .",
    "these are mapped to the fourth components of four - dimensional vector fields @xcite .",
    "the corresponding three - dimensional scalars acquire a mass since they are stabilised .",
    "the corresponding three - dimensional vectors also become massive ( see section [ sec : vectormass ] ) .",
    "so we concluded that the resulting four - dimensional vectors acquire a mass .",
    "this result matches with what was found in @xcite , studying directly type iib on @xmath3 ( see also @xcite ) .    at the end of section [ sec : movebrain ] ,",
    "we have reported one further example .",
    "we have presented a flux that stabilises almost all the moduli , showing that a general f - theory flux would fix almost all the moduli ( except one khler modulus in the lower @xmath2 , that corresponds to the fibre size in the upper @xmath2 ) .    in the last section we have considered the sypersymmetry conditions on the set of the four - dimensional minkowski vacua we have studied . in general supersymmetry",
    "is completely broken , but under some conditions , the @xmath316 or even @xmath364 supersymmetry in four dimensions can be preserved .",
    "we have found these conditions using an eleven - dimensional approach .    in this work",
    "we have studied a particular example , @xmath0 , in which we have complete control over d7-brane stabilisation by fluxes .",
    "this is due to the simplicity of the eight dimensional manifold .",
    "our final goal is to reproduce the results found in this paper using more complicated cy fourfolds , in which the d7 configurations include also intersecting branes .",
    "a first step would be to consider some voisin  borcea manifold , modding out @xmath0 by a freely acting involution .",
    "this breaks the @xmath4 symmetry of @xmath2 and gives a unique complex structure to the fourfold .",
