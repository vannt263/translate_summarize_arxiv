    "security is an important issue of qkd .",
    "one protocol for qkd is said to be secure if it can either generate the key secretly or stops the protocol when any eavesdroppers appear . in this section",
    ", we proof that our proposed protocol is secure , even if the shared quantum channels are public .",
    "first , we consider the security of the random key which is encoded in the outcomes of _ bob _",
    "s measurement and the calculation result of `` _ _ alice _ _",
    "s measurement''assuming that she does not apply any local operations on her particle .",
    "where the symbol `` ' ' implies that _ alice _ does not really apply this measurement and get the outcome , it is just an imaginary measurement .",
    "alice _ has performed a local operation on particle @xmath44 and a bell operator measurement , no eavesdroppers can gain any information , although _ alice _ announces publicly her bell measurement result on particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the reason is that no one except _",
    "_ knows exactly the entangled states of particles @xmath4 and @xmath0 once _ alice _ performs a local operation on her particle . there is only a probability of @xmath45 to guess the correct epr state in which particles @xmath4 and @xmath0 are in .",
    "if eve eavesdrops @xmath46 key bits , she tends to succeed with a probability of @xmath47 which approaches @xmath48 and @xmath49 is sufficiently large .",
    "further , if eve is so clever that she shares the quantum channels with _",
    "alice _ and _ bob _ , or replaces the particles in transit to _",
    "alice _ and _",
    "bob _ by the particles prepared by her , she can succeed in eavesdropping with probability @xmath50 or @xmath45respectively .",
    "this has been certified by us in[14 ] .",
    "then _ bob _ can send some results to _ alice _ to detect the action of eve and thus , eve can not gain any information of the random key .",
    "now turns to the problem of the certain key which is encoded in the local operations performed by _",
    "alice _ on her particle .",
    "it is available to _ bob _ by comparing the state of particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 gotten by _ bob _ with the result announced by _",
    "thus the security of the certain key depends on whether _ bob _ can secretly infer the correct corresponding state of particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 using the entanglement swapping between two initial shared entangled pairs . in our previous work[14 ] , we showed that it is impossible for any eavesdroppers to know the bell operator measurement results by innerspring the transmission .",
    "more detail , eve can not determine the outcomes of the sender and receiver s measurements in which the key is encoded , no matter what methods eve may choose .",
    "there is a probability of @xmath50 to gain the correct information on the key when eve tries to share the quantum communication channels with _ alice _ and _",
    "bob _ , and a success probability of @xmath45 by replacing the particles transported to legitimate users by the particles accessible to her .",
    "this is a useful conclusion even for this different protocol .",
    "that is to say , eve can eavesdrop no information of the certain key .",
    "this protocol is secure , even the shared entangled states are public ( in another words , everyone know that the _ alice _ and _ bob _ shared states are @xmath51 ) . if _ alice _ and _ bob _ do not publish their s measured result , eavesdropper ( _ eve _ ) can not get the information from the known entangled channels .",
    "for example , both the quantum channels are the same _ bell _ states @xmath36 and @xmath37 . by the entanglement swapping calculation , we know the state of these entangled particles are      so the four bell - operator measurement outcomes of alice are equally likely , each occurring with probability @xmath45 . yet the eavesdropper can not get any information , although she owned many entangled pairs in state @xmath53 .        compare eq.[@xmath5 ] with eq.[@xmath2 ] , we found if there is an eavesdropper , there is only @xmath50 probability that the two result are same .",
    "_ bob _ can send some result random to _ alice _",
    ", then _ alice _ can know there is eavesdropper with different result , they give up this key .",
    "eve _ can not gain any information about the key .",
    "if _ eve _ shared the entangled pairs @xmath59 with _",
    "alice _ instead of _ bob _ , _ eve _ shared entangled pairs @xmath60 with _ bob _ , before the key distribution , both _",
    "alice _ and _ bob _ do not know this .",
    "then the process of key distribution become @xmath61        from eq.(@xmath32 ) and eq.(@xmath1 ) , we know that , the probability , which _ bell _ operator measurement of particle @xmath4 and @xmath5 is same as particle @xmath63 and @xmath64 , is only @xmath45 , when bob send some his measurement results to alice , alice can find if there is eavesdropper .",
