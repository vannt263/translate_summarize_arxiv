    "at present , there seems to be a broad consensus in the high energy physics community that the recently discovered scalar particle at the cern - lhc  @xcite behaves as the higgs particle of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) .",
    "the most recent measurements of this scalar particle mass by the atlas and cms collaborations set @xmath10 gev  @xcite and @xmath11 gev  @xcite , respectively .",
    "these experiments also show that the most probable @xmath12 quantum numbers for this discovered higgs boson are @xmath13 , and conclude that the measured higgs particle couplings to the other sm particles are in agreement so far , although yet with moderate precision , with the values predicted in the sm .",
    "also the scalar higgs - like particle width @xmath14 has been found to be @xmath15 mev which is about 4.2 times the sm value  @xcite .    on the other hand , there is also a major consensus that the sm must be modified in order to include the neutrino masses and oscillations in agreement with present data , which are nowadays quite impressive and urge of an explanation from a theoretical framework beyond the sm .",
    "thus , in order to be compatible with the present neutrino data we choose here to go beyond the sm using one of its simplest and more appealing extensions , the inverse seesaw model ( iss )  @xcite .",
    "this iss extends the sm particle content by adding pairs of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos with opposite lepton number whose masses and couplings can be properly chosen to produce the physical light neutrino masses and oscillations in good agreement with present data  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the original seesaw type i model  @xcite , the seesaw mechanism that produces the small light physical neutrino masses in the iss is associated to the smallness of the majorana mass model parameters , such that when these are set to zero lepton number conservation is restored , therefore increasing the symmetries of the model .",
    "another appealing feature of the iss is that it allows for large yukawa neutrino couplings while having at the same time moderately heavy right - handed neutrino masses at the @xmath16 energies that are reachable at the present colliders , like the lhc .",
    "in addition to the possibility of being directly produced at colliders , these right - handed neutrinos could also lead to a new rich phenomenology in connection with lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) physics .",
    "this is because the iss right - handed neutrinos can produce non - negligible contributions to lfv processes via radiative corrections that are mediated by the sizable neutrino yukawa couplings , therefore leading to clear signals / imprints in these rare processes , which are totally absent in the sm .",
    "these lfv processes include the most frequently studied radiative decays , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , others like @xmath17 , leptonic and semileptonic @xmath18 decays , @xmath19 conversion in heavy nuclei , and others ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the iss mechanism also has implications on deviations from lepton flavor universality  @xcite and from lepton number conservation  @xcite .",
    "although quite promising future sensitivities for some of these lfv processes are expected , for instance , for @xmath19 conversion in heavy nuclei  @xcite , at present the highest sensitivity to lfv signals is obtained in @xmath3 where meg has set an upper bound at branching ratio ( br ) , br@xmath20  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study other lfv processes , the higgs decays into lepton - antilepton pairs @xmath0 with @xmath21 , which are of obvious interest at present , given the recent discovery of the higgs particle and the fact that these rare higgs decays are also being presently explored at the lhc .",
    "the current direct search at the lhc for these lfv higgs decays ( lfvhd ) has been recently reported in @xcite , where an upper limit of br@xmath22 at @xmath23 c.l . has been set using @xmath24 of @xmath25 tev .",
    "this improves previous constraints from indirect measurements at lhc @xcite by roughly one order of magnitude ( see also @xcite ) , and it is close to the previous estimates in @xcite that predicted sensitivities of @xmath26 ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "the future perspectives for lfvhd searches are encouraging due to the expected high statistics of higgs events at future hadronic and leptonic colliders .",
    "although , to our knowledge , there is no realistic study , including background estimates , of the expected future experimental sensitivities for these kinds of rare lfvhd events , a naive extrapolation from the present situation can be done .",
    "for instance , the future lhc runs with @xmath27  tev and total integrated luminosity of first @xmath28 and later @xmath29 expect the production of about 25 and 250 million higgs events , respectively , to be compared with 1 million higgs events that the lhc produced after the first run @xcite .",
    "these large numbers suggest an improvement in the long - term sensitivities to br@xmath30 of at least two orders of magnitude with respect to the present sensitivity .",
    "similarly , at the planned lepton colliders , like the international linear collider ( ilc ) with @xmath31 tev and @xmath32@xcite , and the future electron - positron circular collider ( fcc - ee ) as the tlep with @xmath33 gev and @xmath34@xcite , the expectations are of about 1 and 2 million higgs events , respectively , with much lower backgrounds due to the cleaner environment , which will also allow for a large improvement in lfv higgs searches with respect to the current sensitivities .    we will present a full one - loop computation of the lfv partial decay widths , @xmath35 , within the iss context with three extra pairs of right - handed neutrinos , and will analyze in full detail the predictions for the lfvhd rates , br@xmath36 , as functions of the various relevant iss parameters .",
    "these lfv higgs decays were analyzed in the context of the sm enlarged with three heavy majorana neutrinos for the first time in  @xcite .",
    "later , they were computed in the context of the seesaw i model in  @xcite , and they were found to lead to extremely small rates due to the strong suppression from the extremely heavy right - handed neutrino masses , at @xmath37 gev , in that case .",
    "this motivates our study of the lfv higgs decays in the iss case with the right - handed neutrino masses lying in contrast at the @xmath16 energy scale and therefore the rates are expected to be larger than in the seesaw i case .",
    "the interest of neutrino masses at this @xmath38 energy scale is also because they can be directly produced at the lhc .",
    "furthermore , we will also study in parallel the correlated one - loop predictions for the radiative decays , br(@xmath2 ) , within this same iss context , and we will require full compatibility of our predictions with the present experimental upper bounds for the three relevant radiative decays , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , the first one being the most constraining one .",
    "we will require in addition that the input parameters of the iss are compatible with the present neutrino data and other constraints , like perturbativity of the neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "after exploring the iss parameter space we will conclude on the maximum allowed lfv higgs decay rates within the iss .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ th - framework ] we summarize our theoretical framework and shortly review the main features of the iss that are relevant for the present computation . in section [ widths ]",
    "we present our computation of the one - loop lfv higgs decay widths within the iss and include , for completeness and comparison , both the analytical formulas for the lfv higgs decays and the lfv radiative decays .",
    "the full one - loop analytical formulas for the lfv higgs form factors are collected in the appendix .",
    "section [ results ] is devoted to the presentation of the numerical results of our computation and also includes the predictions for both kind of lfv processes , the branching ratios for the lfv higgs decays , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 that we compare with the branching ratios for the radiative decays , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "one of the simplest extensions of the sm leading to nonzero neutrino masses and mixing is the addition of fermionic gauge singlets . as mentioned above , a very attractive model is the iss that supplements the sm with pairs of rh neutrinos , denoted here by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with opposite lepton number .",
    "while the minimal model that fits oscillation data requires only two generations of rh neutrinos  @xcite , we consider here a more generic model containing three pairs of fermionic singlets .",
    "it extends the sm lagrangian with the following neutrino yukawa interactions and mass terms : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the sm lepton doublet , @xmath46 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being the corresponding pauli matrix , @xmath49 is the @xmath50 neutrino yukawa coupling matrix , @xmath51 is a lepton number conserving complex @xmath50 mass matrix , and @xmath52 is a majorana complex @xmath50 symmetric mass matrix that violates lepton number conservation by two units . setting the latter to zero would restore the conservation of lepton number , thus increasing the symmetry of the model .",
    "this makes the smallness of @xmath52 natural since it could be seen as the remnant of a symmetry broken at a higher energy  @xcite . since a majorana mass term of the type @xmath53",
    "would only give subleading corrections to the neutrino masses and the observables considered here , we have taken it to be zero , for simplicity .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath54 neutrino mass matrix reads , in the electroweak interaction basis @xmath55 , @xmath56 with the @xmath50 dirac mass matrix given by @xmath57 , and the higgs vacuum expectation value is taken to be @xmath58 .",
    "since this mass matrix is complex and symmetric , it can be diagonalized using a @xmath54 unitary matrix @xmath59 according to @xmath60 this gives three light mass eigenstates and six heavy mass eigenstates , and the electroweak eigenstates and the mass eigenstates are related through @xmath61 in order to illustrate more simply the dependence on the seesaw parameters , let us first consider the one generation case and then we will come back to the three generation case . in this one generation case",
    "there are just three iss model parameters , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath49 , and there are just three physical eigenstates : one light @xmath62 and two heavy @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in the limit @xmath65 ,",
    "the mass eigenvalues are given by : @xmath66 with the light neutrino mass @xmath67 being proportional to @xmath52 , thus making it naturally small , and the two heavy masses @xmath68 being close to each other .",
    "as a consequence in this @xmath65 limit , these two nearly degenerate heavy neutrinos combine to form pseudo - dirac fermions .",
    "a similar pattern of neutrino mass eigenvalues occurs in the three generation case , with one light and two nearly degenerate heavy neutrinos per generation .",
    "this can be illustrated clearly in the limit @xmath69 , where the mass matrix @xmath70 can be diagonalized by blocks  @xcite , leading to the following @xmath71 light neutrino mass matrix : @xmath72 which is then diagonalized using the unitary pontecorvo-maki-nakagawa-sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xmath73@xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are the masses of the three lightest neutrinos .",
    "then , by defining a new @xmath71 mass matrix by @xmath78 the light neutrino mass matrix can be written similarly to the type i seesaw model as : @xmath79 the mass pattern of the heavy neutrinos in the @xmath69 limit presents a similar behavior to the one generation case .",
    "the heavy neutrinos form quasidegenerate pairs with a mass approximately given by the eigenvalues of @xmath51 , namely @xmath80 for the first , second , and third generation , respectively , and with a splitting of order @xmath81 .    for our phenomenological purposes , and in order to implement easily the compatibility with present neutrino data , we will use here the useful casas - ibarra parametrization  @xcite that can be directly applied to the inverse seesaw model case , giving @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a unitary matrix that diagonalizes @xmath84 according to @xmath85 and @xmath86 is a complex orthogonal matrix that can be written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are arbitrary complex angles .    in summary , assuming @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( hence , diagonal @xmath84 ) , the input iss parameters that will have to be fixed for our forthcoming study of the lfv rates are the following : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath80 , @xmath97 , and the entries of the @xmath73 matrix .",
    "for all the numerical analysis in this work , and in order to keep agreement with the experimental neutrino data , we will choose the lightest neutrino mass , here assumed to be @xmath75 , as a free input parameter and the other two light masses will be obtained from the two experimentally measured mass differences : @xmath98    similarly , the three light neutrino mixing angles will also be set to their measured values . for simplicity",
    ", we will set to zero the cp - violating phase of the @xmath73 matrix .",
    "specifically , we have used the results of the global fit  @xcite leading to @xmath99 where we have assumed a normal hierarchy . regarding the input lightest neutrino mass , @xmath75 ,",
    "we have chosen it so that the effective electron neutrino mass in @xmath100 decay agrees with the upper limit from the mainz and troitsk experiments  @xcite , @xmath101 for the final numerical evaluation of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the full @xmath102 neutrino matrix , we have used our private mathematica code that solves this system numerically , using all the previously mentioned input parameters and experimental data ; and besides it also computes the yukawa coupling matrix entries by using eq .",
    "( [ casasibarraiss ] ) .    in order to illustrate the kind of generic neutrino spectra that one obtains in the iss and that indeed follow the previously commented pattern , we have chosen in this section to show three examples of spectra whose",
    "most relevant parameters for the present work are collected in table  [ spectra ] .",
    ".examples of neutrino mass spectrum in the iss for various input parameters .",
    "the relevant nondiagonal @xmath103 elements are also included . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we present our predictions for the lfvhd rates in our above selected examples in fig .  [ maxlfvhd ] as a function of the degenerate right - handed neutrino mass @xmath51 . for these predictions",
    "we have used the full one - loop formulas .",
    "we have also checked that the approximate formulas in eqs .",
    "( [ fithtaumu ] ) and ( [ fithtaue ] ) give a quite good estimate of these brs in the large @xmath51 region , with deviations with respect to the full result smaller than @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "the main conclusion from these plots is that with these specific yukawa textures one can indeed reach large lfvhd rates of the order of @xmath106 and still be compatible with all the bounds from radiative decays .",
    "the textures @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) corresponding to lower @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) allow for lower @xmath51 values and vice versa .",
    "thus , @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) leads the maximum allowed br@xmath113 ( br@xmath114 ) rates for @xmath51 around 10 tev ( 11 tev ) , @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) around 5.5 tev ( 6 tev ) , and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) around 2 tev ( 2.5 tev ) .",
    "the above textures are just some selected examples , among many possibilities , but the important feature is that they will all provide maximum allowed rates of around @xmath106 .",
    "we have also checked that by selecting examples with hierarchical @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 masses we do not obtain larger maximum allowed rates .",
    "thus , our conclusion is quite generic for the maximum allowed lfvhd rates in the iss models .",
    "the other generic feature that is worth mentioning is that , given the correlated rates found between @xmath122 and @xmath123 [ similarly , between @xmath124 and @xmath125 , if an improved future upper experimental bound on @xmath126 [ similarly , on @xmath127 is provided , this will be intermediately translated into a smaller maximal allowed value for @xmath128 [ similarly , for @xmath129 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the lfv higgs decays @xmath0 within the context of the inverse seesaw model where three additional pairs ( one pair per generation ) of massive right - handed singlet neutrinos are added to the standard model particle content .",
    "we have presented a full one - loop computation of the br(@xmath0 ) rates for the three possible channels , @xmath130 , and have analyzed in full detail the predictions as functions of the various relevant iss parameters .",
    "the most relevant parameters for lfv have been found to be @xmath131 and @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , we have required that the input parameters of this iss model be compatible with the present neutrino data and other constraints , like perturbativity of the neutrino yukawa couplings and the present bounds for the three radiative decays @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 . to take control on this last requirement ,",
    "we have studied along this paper in parallel to the lfv higgs decays the correlated one - loop predictions for the radiative decays , @xmath2 , within this same iss context .",
    "we have explored the iss parameter space and consider both kinds of scenarios for the right - handed neutrinos , with either degenerate or hierarchical masses .",
    "first , we have considered the simplest case of diagonal @xmath51 and @xmath52 matrices . in this case",
    ", we conclude that the largest maximum lfv higgs decay rates within the iss that are allowed by all the constraints are for br(@xmath135 ) and br(@xmath136 ) and reach at most @xmath137 for the degenerate heavy neutrino case and @xmath138 for the hierarchical case .",
    "second , we have explored more general iss scenarios with nondiagonal @xmath52 matrices that we have found more promising for lfvhd searches . these can also accommodate successfully the low energy neutrino data , and be compatible with the present bounds on the radiative decays and with the perturbativity bounds on the neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "we have demonstrated that in this kind of iss scenarios there are solutions with much larger allowed lfvhd rates than in the previous cases , leading to maximal allowed rates of around @xmath106 for either br(@xmath136 ) or br(@xmath135 ) .",
    "assuming in addition @xmath139 conservation in these scenarios , the final lfvhd rates should be multiplied by a factor of 2 if the @xmath139 conjugate channels br(@xmath140 ) and br(@xmath141 ) are also considered .",
    "finally , we have also provided a few particular examples where the predicted rates with the full one - loop formulas indeed give such a large lfvhd rate of @xmath142 , for values of @xmath51 in the interval ( 1 tev , 10 tev ) .",
    "we certainly find these lfvhd rates and @xmath51 values interesting , given the expected extremely high statistics of up to hundreds of millions of higgs bosons that will be produced at the future colliders , allowing for searches of rare higgs decays , and the potential of lhc to explore new particles at the tev region .",

    "<S> in this paper we consider a higgs boson with mass and other properties compatible with those of the recently discovered higgs particle at the lhc , and explore the possibility of new higgs leptonic decays , beyond the standard model , with the singular feature of being lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) . </S>",

    "<S> we require in addition that the input parameters of this iss model are compatible with the present neutrino data and other constraints , like perturbativity of the neutrino yukawa couplings . </S>",
