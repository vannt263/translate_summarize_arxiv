    "ever since einstein , podolsky , and rosen in their seminal paper from 1935 @xcite introduced the possibility of entangling two quantum system , entanglement has been viewed as one the most curious and spectacular phenomena in quantum mechanics . in the past few years",
    "the role of entanglement in quantum mechanics has shifted dramatically from being a fundamental test of the foundation of the entire quantum mechanical theory to being a technical resource in the rapidly developing field of quantum information .",
    "thus , the hunt is on for reliable sources of entanglement .",
    "these have been available for discrete as well as continuous states of the electromagnetic field .",
    "however , entangled states of material particles have presented a greater experimental challenge .",
    "macroscopic samples of atoms as a resource of entanglement have attracted a lot of attention in recent years because of their relatively simple experimental realization ( works at room temperature ) and robustness to single particle decoherence . in @xcite entanglement of this kind",
    "was accomplished .",
    "however , the two samples were located only 1 cm apart in the same shielded environment .",
    "this meant that this implementation did not incorporate the important feature in e.g.  the teleportation protocol , that the distance of teleportation given by the separation of the entangled systems could be arbitrary .",
    "we have created two separate environments each containing a gas sample of cesium atoms at room temperature .",
    "as we will see , we have successfully created entangled states between two such systems being 0.35 m apart . in the present paper we will also focus on a better method to verify the generation of entangled states as compared to the experiment in @xcite .",
    "in this section we introduce the physical systems involved in the experiment , i.e.  we introduce the atomic spin samples and the polarization state of laser pulses interacting with each other . based on the equations of motion we will in sec .",
    "[ sec : ent_create_model ] explain how the interaction can be utilized for entanglement generation .      our atomic system",
    "is composed of two separate samples of spin polarized cesium vapour placed in paraffin coated glass cells at room temperature .",
    "cesium has a hyperfine split ground state with total angular momentum @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the latter being our atomic quantum system of interest . having a macroscopic ensemble of atoms ( around @xmath0 )",
    "we will define the theoretically discrete but effectively continuous collective spin variables @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the individual atom",
    ". these will retain regular angular momentum commutation relations , @xmath8=i{\\hat{j}}_x$ ] .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty relation will then lead to @xmath9",
    ". we will be interested in the state in which practically all atoms are in the @xmath4 , @xmath10 state with @xmath11 as quantization axis .",
    "all the relevant interactions only involve minute changes in the macroscopic spin orientation .",
    "@xmath12 can then be regarded as a constant classical number .",
    "if all atoms are independent this will give rise to a minimum uncertainty state called the coherent spin state ( css ) with : @xmath13 we therefore see that the variance , often referred to as the projection noise , of the css will grow proportionally to the number of atoms .",
    "this scaling is manifestly quantum and will be important for the verification of the entanglement .      in complete analogy to the atomic collective spin variables ,",
    "the polarization state of a pulse of light can be described by a vector , the so - called stokes vector . for light propagating along the @xmath14-axis",
    "we define @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the photon fluxes of @xmath11 and @xmath18-polarized photons , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are photon fluxes measured in a basis rotated @xmath21 with respect to the @xmath22-axes , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 refer to photons with @xmath25 and @xmath26-polarization . in our experiments",
    "the light will with very good approximation be linearly polarized along the @xmath11-axis .",
    "then @xmath27 can be described by a classical @xmath28-number .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 operators will contain the interesting quantum variables .",
    "the stokes operators defined above have dimension @xmath31 .",
    "this is convenient for describing light / matter interactions as we will see below .",
    "but for entanglement generation or quantum information protocols in general it is more convenient to consider entire pulses which are time integrated versions of the above .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath32 } = i\\int_0^t{\\hat{s}_{x}}(t)dt    = n_{\\mathrm{ph}}/2,\\ ] ] where the last equality holds in our case for strong linear polarization along the @xmath11-axis . from this commutator",
    "we derive the variance of the minimum uncertainty state called the coherent state : @xmath33 note again the characteristic linear quantum scaling with the number of particles @xmath34 .",
    "we often refer to the variance of the coherent light state as the shot noise level .    for completeness we will note that for coherent light states it can be shown @xcite that @xmath35 the usefulness of this will be shown below . in our experiment we will use @xmath36 detections to create entanglement between atomic samples .",
    "if initially @xmath11-polarized light is rotated a small angle @xmath37 around the axis of propagation ( @xmath14 ) we get @xmath38 .",
    "this is why an @xmath36 detection is sometimes referred to as a polarization rotation measurement .",
    "we couple our light and atomic system by tuning a laser beam off - resonantly to the @xmath39 dipole transition in cesium .",
    "this leads to the following equations of interaction : @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the beam cross section , @xmath43 is the detuning ( red positive ) , @xmath44 is the optical wavelength , and @xmath45 is the natural linewidth of the excited state @xmath46 . in and out",
    "refer to light before and after passing the atomic sample , respectively .",
    "the above equations have been derived carefully in @xcite but we will give a short physical explanation here .",
    "first of all , the interaction is refractive in nature ( the absorption of the off - resonant light is negligible ) .",
    "it is convenient to consider the incoming linearly polarized light in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 basis",
    ". the phase shift of a @xmath25 and a @xmath26 photon propagating through atoms will be different if there is a spin component @xmath47 along the propagation direction . for instance ( quantized along @xmath14 ) an atom in the @xmath48 magnetic sub - level couples strongly to @xmath25 photons and weakly to @xmath26 photons . for the @xmath49 sub - level",
    "the situation is reversed .",
    "the differential phase shift of @xmath25 , @xmath26 photons turns out to depend linearly on @xmath47 which leads to a polarization rotation of the incoming linearly polarized light proportionally to @xmath47 ( also known as faraday rotation ) .",
    "( [ eq : syout ] ) is a first order approximation of this effect .",
    "the different coupling strengths for different sub - levels also lead to a stark shift of atomic levels depending on the sub - level quantum number @xmath50 and the incoming light polarization .",
    "integrated over time , the stark shifts lead to different phase changes of the magnetic sub - levels which changes the spin state .",
    "if for instance there are more @xmath25 than @xmath26 photons , the @xmath48 sub - state will be affected more than the @xmath49 state .",
    "the amount of @xmath25 and @xmath26 photons is measured by the @xmath51 operator .",
    "it turns out that the spin state evolution can be described as a rotation of the spin around the @xmath14-axis by an amount proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "this is given to first order in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jyout ] ) ( the rotation is so small that @xmath52 is unaffected ) .    in the interaction process the @xmath25 and @xmath26 photons experience phase shifts but are not absorbed . in the off - resonant limit the flux of @xmath25 and @xmath26 photons",
    "are individually conserved leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : szout ] ) . by conservation of angular momentum along the @xmath14-direction",
    "this leads to the constancy of @xmath47 expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : jzout ] ) .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : syout ] ) and ( [ eq : jzout ] ) that in the case of a large interaction strength ( i.e.  if @xmath53 dominates @xmath54 ) a measurement on @xmath55 amounts to a measurement of @xmath56 without destroying the state of @xmath56 .",
    "this is termed a quantum non demolition ( qnd ) measurement of @xmath56 . using off - resonant light for qnd measurements of spins",
    "has also been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : jyout ] ) implies that a part of the state of light is also mapped onto the atoms .",
    "this opens up the possibility of using this sort of system for quantum memory .",
    "one step in this direction is discussed in @xcite .      in the experiment a constant and homogeneous magnetic field is added in the @xmath11-direction .",
    "we discuss the experimental reason for this below . for our modeling the magnetic field",
    "adds a term @xmath57 to the hamiltonian .",
    "this makes the transverse spin components precess at the larmor frequency @xmath58 depending on the strength of the field .",
    "introducing the rotating frame coordinates : @xmath59 we can easily show that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : syout])-([eq : jzout ] ) will transform into : @xmath60 thus , the atomic imprint on the light is encoded in the @xmath58-sideband instead of at the carrier frequency .",
    "the advantage of this added feature is threefold .",
    "the first and perhaps most important advantage is that lasers are generally a lot more quiet at high sideband frequencies compared to the carrier .",
    "a measurement without a magnetic field will be a dc measurement and the technical noise would dominate the subtle quantum signal . secondly , the @xmath61-field introduces a larmor splitting of the magnetic sublevels of the hyperfine ground state multiplet , thus lifting the degeneracy .",
    "this will introduce an energy barrier strongly suppressing spin flipping collision .",
    "the lifetime of the atomic spin state is consequently greatly increased .",
    "the last advantage is that as long as the measurement time is longer than @xmath62 eq .",
    "( [ eq : syout_rotating ] ) enables us to access both @xmath63 and @xmath64 at the same time .",
    "we are of course not allowed to perform non - destructive measurements on these two operators simultaneously since they are non - commuting .",
    "this is also reflected by the fact that neither @xmath65 nor @xmath47 are constant in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jydot_rotating ] ) and  ( [ eq : jzdot_rotating ] ) . in section  [ sec : ent_create_model ] we shall consider two atomic samples and the third advantage becomes evident .",
    "in this section we define what is meant by entangled states of atomic samples and we adapt the equations of motion from previous sections for this purpose .",
    "we will derive a simple model for the entanglement creation and describe how to verify that the states created really are entangled . in @xcite a much more elaborate description of entanglement creation",
    "is given .",
    "let us here state the criterion to fulfil in order to prove the generation of entangled states .",
    "since entanglement is the nonlocal interconnection of two systems we need to have two atomic samples a and b. entanglement is usually defined in terms of density matrices so that a and b are entangled if they are connected in such a way that it is impossible to write the total density matrix as a product , @xmath66 . for our continuous variable system",
    "we have the experimentally practical criterion derived from the above definition in @xcite : @xmath67 where we have assumed both samples to be macroscopically oriented with same magnitude @xmath52 .",
    "the two samples are indexed by 1 and 2 . comparing to eq .",
    "( [ eq : varcss ] ) we get an equality for two independent atomic samples in the css . to have entanglement we thus need to know the sums of the spin components along the @xmath18- and the @xmath14-directions better than we could ever know each of the spin projections by itself .",
    "it is now interesting to examine the commutator between the sums , @xmath68}=i(j_{x1}+j_{x2})$ ] .",
    "a non - zero commutator means that increasing our knowledge of one component will automatically decrease our knowledge of the other , thus making our attempts to break the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ eq : entcritduan ] ) futile . now comes the trick that makes entanglement generation possible in our experiment .",
    "assume @xmath69 and @xmath70 to be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction .",
    "the commutator will then become zero and we can at least theoretically measure both components with arbitrary precision , thereby satisfying the entanglement criterion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : entcritduan ] ) .",
    "inspired by the above we will from now on assume @xmath71 .",
    "we will re - express the equations of motion  ( [ eq : syout_rotating])-([eq : jzdot_rotating ] ) for two samples in a way which is much more convenient for the understanding of our entanglement creation and verification procedure .",
    "we introduce position and momentum like operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 to describe pulses of light and the atomic systems .",
    "this is a more abstract but hopefully also more well known and intuitive way to express the interactions creating the entangled states .    for two atomic samples we write equations of motion : @xmath72\\sin(\\omega t)\\right .",

    "the constancy of these terms together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : syout_rotating_two ] ) allows us to perform qnd measurements on the two sums .",
    "we note that each of the sums can be accessed by considering the two operators @xmath75 we have used the fact that @xmath76 and that @xmath77 .",
    "each of the operators on the left hand side can be measured simultaneously by making a @xmath78-measurement and multiplying the photocurrent by @xmath79 or @xmath80 followed by integration over the duration @xmath81 .",
    "the possibility to gain information about @xmath73 and @xmath74 enables us to break the inequality  ( [ eq : entcritduan ] ) . at the same time we must loose information about some other physical variable",
    "this is indeed true , the conjugate variables to these sums are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "these have the time evolution @xmath84 we see how noise from the input @xmath51-variable is piling up in the difference components while we are allowed to learn about the sum components via @xmath78 measurements .",
    "the above equations clearly describe the physical ingredients in play but the notation is cumbersome .",
    "therefore we define new operators . for the atomic system",
    "we take    @xmath85    new light operators will be    @xmath86    each pair of @xmath87 operators satisfy the usual commutation relation , e.g.  we have @xmath88 } = i$ ] .",
    "all previous equations now translate into    @xmath89    where we remember @xmath90 refer to the definitions above and not the two samples .",
    "the parameter describing the strength of light / matter - interactions is given by @xmath91 .",
    "the limit to strong coupling is around @xmath92 .",
    "note , we have two decoupled sets of interacting light and atomic operators .    in the transition from stokes operators to canonical variables in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : def_xl1]-d ) the result  ( [ eq : correlation_syz ] ) is a convenient tool for calculating variances . if for instance the input light state is the coherent vacuum state we have @xmath93 which is as expected . likewise",
    ", if the two atomic samples are each in the coherent state we will derive e.g.  @xmath94 .",
    "coherent states of atomic or light systems as defined above correspond to what is known as coherent states of the @xmath87-operators .",
    "the entanglement criterion  ( [ eq : entcritduan ] ) written in @xmath87-language is @xmath95 we see that entanglement of the two atomic samples can be considered as so - called two mode squeezing .",
    "the uncertainty in the uncoupled pair of operators @xmath96 and @xmath97 is reduced on the expense of the increased noise in the operators @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "now we turn to the actual understanding of entanglement generation and verification .",
    "experimentally we perform the following steps ( more details will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimental - setup ] ) .",
    "first the atoms are prepared in the oppositely oriented coherent states corresponding to creating the vacuum states of the two modes @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "next a pulse of light called the _ entangling pulse _ is sent through atoms and we measure the two operators @xmath102 and @xmath103 with outcomes @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "these results bear information about the atomic operators @xmath96 and @xmath97 and hence we reduce variances @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "to prove we have an entangled state we must confirm that the variances of @xmath96 and @xmath97 fulfil the criterion  ( [ eq : ent_critetrion_xp ] ) .",
    "that is we need to know the mean values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 with a total precision better than unity . for this demonstration",
    "we send a second _ verifying pulse _ through the atomic samples again measuring @xmath102 and @xmath103 with outcomes @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "now it is a matter of comparing @xmath104 with @xmath108 and @xmath105 with @xmath109 .",
    "if the results are sufficiently close the state created by the first pulse was entangled .",
    "now let us be more quantitative .",
    "the interaction  ( [ interact_light ] ) mapping the atomic operators @xmath110 out on light is very useful for a strong @xmath111 and useless if @xmath112 .",
    "we will describe in detail the role of @xmath111 for all values .",
    "to this end we first describe the natural way to determine @xmath111 experimentally .",
    "if we repeatedly perform the first two steps of the measurement cycle , i.e.  prepare coherent states of the atomic spins and performing the first measurement pulse with outcomes @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we may deduce the statistical properties of the measurement outcomes .",
    "theoretically we expect from  ( [ interact_light ] ) @xmath113 the first term in the variances is the shot noise ( sn ) of light .",
    "this can be measured in absence of the interaction where @xmath114 .",
    "the quantum nature of the shot noise level is confirmed by checking the linear scaling with photon number of the pulse , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : shot_noise ] ) .",
    "the second term arises from the projection noise ( pn ) of atoms .",
    "hence , we may calibrate @xmath115 to be the ratio @xmath116 of atomic projection noise to shot noise of light .",
    "theoretically @xmath115 has the linear scaling @xmath117 with the macroscopic spin size @xmath52 which must be confirmed in the experiment .",
    "next we describe how to deduce the statistical properties of the state created by the @xmath118 . based on the measurement results @xmath104 and @xmath105 of this pulse",
    "we must predict the mean value of the second measurement outcome . if @xmath119 we ought to trust the first measurement completely since the initial noise of @xmath120 is negligible , i.e.  @xmath121 and @xmath122 . on the other hand , if @xmath114 we know that atoms must still be in the vacuum state such that @xmath123 .",

    "the discrepancy is a little more than a factor of two but this is acceptable for our quite simple modeling .",

    "we conclude that the simple decoherence model has some truth in it and we must accept that the entangled state created can only be verified to be around `` 65% as good '' as expected in an ideal world .      above",

    "we comment on the physical grounds for the decoherence .",

    "we have studied the @xmath197-time extensively . a very good method for this",
    "is to create ( by applying an rf - magnetic pulse ) a displaced version of the coherent spin state with e.g.  @xmath200 .",
    "this non - zero mean value can be detected by our standard @xmath78-detection method and the decay following  ( [ eq : t2decay ] ) may be observed .",
    "our experience tells us that power broadening by the laser pulses combined with light assisted atomic collisions play the important role in the decoherence processes . for high densities and high optical powers",
    "we may find @xmath197 as low as 5ms .",

    "[ fig : alldataentanglement ] .",
    "it is our experience that the observed decoherence in the entanglement experiments is stronger than that expected from the processes mentioned above .",
    "this is indeed true for shorter pulses .",
    "we believe that the atomic motion in and out of the laser beam combined with inhomogeneous light / atom coupling due to the doppler effect may also play a role , but we need further investigation to confirm this completely .      to conclude the experimental section we emphasize that we have generated entangled states between distant atomic samples in the sense that each vapour cell sits in its own magnetic shield .",
    "the two shields can in principle be moved as far apart as is practical , our experiment was performed with a distance of 35 cm . in the future",
    "we hope to extend this distance further .",
    "the noise reduction below the level set by separable states was measured up to 25% .",
    "this number is mainly limited by power broadening and light assisted collisional relaxation of the atomic spins .",
    "the decoherence is successfully modeled by a single parameter @xmath194 . a much more elaborate theory on entanglement generation in presence of decoherence and losses",
    "exists @xcite .",
    "we should note , that the generated entangled states have random but known ( based on @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) mean values .",
    "it is possible by applying rf - magnetic fields to shift the entangled states to having zero mean value while preserving the reduced variance .",
    "experimental demonstration of such will be considered elsewhere .",
    "we will now present a brief overview of some of the interesting applications in the field of quantum information of our reliable source of distant atomic entanglement .",
    "quantum teleportation was first proposed in 1993 @xcite and the year after for the special case of continuous variables @xcite .",
    "teleportation is extremely important since direct transport of physical states is often hindered by exponential decoherence . with quantum teleportation the information is cleanly separated into a classical part , which can be transmitted over arbitrary distances , and a quantum mechanical part , which only needs to interact locally .",
    "a proposal for spin state teleportation was given in @xcite .",
    "three atomic samples are needed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : teleport](a ) .",
    "adjacent samples are oriented oppositely along the @xmath11-axis so that both collective measurements on cells 1 and 2 and on cells 1 and 3 will be regular entangling interactions as discussed earlier .",

    "the goal is now to teleport an unknown state in cell 3 onto cell 2 .",
    "first cells 1 and 2 are entangled giving the measurement results @xmath202 .",
    "next a pulse is sent through cells 1 and 3 and the measurement results @xmath203 are communicated classically to bob .",
    "he can now by applying a rotation to his system based on the outcomes of the two measurements recreate the unknown state in his cell .",
    "this of course only works with perfect fidelity in the large interaction regime ( @xmath204 ) .          as described in @xcite an entangled state",
    "can also be teleported using macroscopic samples of atoms . in this case",
    "alice and bob each have two samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teleport](b ) ) .",
    "first each one of alice s samples are entangled with one of bob s .",
    "then a pulse of light is sent through alice s two samples making it an entangled state .",
    "alice now sends the result of a measurement on this last entangling pulse to bob . using this and the results of the two primary entangling pulses he can displace one of his states .",
    "this entangles his two samples without ever bringing the two into direct contact . had alice shifted one of her spin states prior to creating the entanglement between her two cells the exact same protocol would allow bob to recover this shift in his cells .",
    "this allows for secret quantum communication .      with an entangled source of atoms an unknown state of light",
    "can also be teleported onto this @xcite .",
    "assume we have two atomic samples with @xmath205 and @xmath206 , i.e.  a perfect epr - entangled state .",
    "the protocol is simpler without rotating spins but also works with . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : syout ] ) @xmath56 is mapped onto @xmath36 when light propagating along the @xmath14 axis is sent through an atomic sample . if light is sent through the first atomic sample and subsequently detected the measurement result can be fed back into @xmath207 such that the original atomic variables exactly cancel .",
    "@xmath36 has now been mapped perfectly onto @xmath207 .",

    "@xmath208 is now stored in @xmath212 and the teleportation is complete .",
    "this process could also be reversed so that an unknown atomic state is mapped onto a light pulse via two epr - entangled light beams .",
    "this shows that macroscopic samples of atoms offers a very feasible protocol for complete quantum memory .",

    "the abundance of available quantum information protocols for this type of continuous variable atomic system the importance of this achievement is evident .",
    "although quantum teleportation of atomic states has been achieved recently @xcite none of these approaches display directly scalable distance between the unknown quantum state and the target system .",
    "our system must therefore be considered an important candidate for achieving the long standing goal of high fidelity transfer of atomic states over great distances upon which many of the proposed technical applications of entanglement and teleportation critically depend .",
