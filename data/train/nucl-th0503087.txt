    "the scattering of real and virtual photons off nucleon targets is the simplest process to study the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon and its excitation to baryon resonances through vector fields .",
    "the link between vector fields and photons is established by assuming the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) of the electromagnetic current @xcite .",
    "we consider photon - nucleon kinematics such that the total center of mass energy is in the mass range of low - lying baryon resonances ( @xmath1 gev ) .",

    "these processes , the production of bethe - heitler pairs and the @xmath0 decay of time - like photons , will in general interfere . the contribution of the @xmath19 transition amplitude to the @xmath4 reaction is of much interest . in the vector meson dominance model of the electromagnetic current ,",
    "it is indeed sensitive to the decay of low - lying baryon resonances into the vector meson nucleon channel below the @xmath2- and @xmath3-meson threshold .",

    ". the contributions of @xmath2- and @xmath3-decays to the @xmath4 cross section will also display interference patterns .",
    "we consider @xmath0 pair invariant masses not too far from the vector meson poles where the vector meson dominance assumption is expected to be valid and where significant constraints arise from the @xmath5 and @xmath20 reactions .",
    "we note that , just as the @xmath14 and @xmath21 processes give information on two decay channels of the baryon resonances excited in virtual photon - nucleon scattering , the @xmath4 and @xmath22 reactions select different entrance channels for the excitation of these resonances .",
    "combined descriptions of both processes are therefore particularly invaluable to study the coupling of baryon resonances to specific decay channels .",
    "extending such a comparison to higher invariant masses ( @xmath23 2.1 gev ) might be very relevant to study the issue of the missing resonances predicted by constituent quark models and unobserved in the pion - nucleon channel @xcite .    in the spirit of the above discussion",

    "the laboratory photon energy varies from 0.9 until about 3 gev .",
    "these data are in the process of being analyzed . as the @xmath24 reaction has a much lower cross section than the @xmath25 reaction , the @xmath26 process should be dominated by @xmath25 in specific regions of phase space ( corresponding to the largest @xmath0 pair invariant masses ) and hence provide a first test of our theoretical model .",

    "the antisymmetric part reflects the interference of the bethe - heitler and vector meson pairs .",
    "the comparison of the symmetric and antisymmetric cross sections calls first for a general remark : the antisymmetric cross section is much smaller ( by more than two orders of magnitude in the mass range of interest ) than the symmetric cross section .",
