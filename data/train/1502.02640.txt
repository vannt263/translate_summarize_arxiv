    "thermoacoustic tomography ( tat )  @xcite and photo- or opto- acoustic tomography ( pat or oat )  @xcite are based on the thermoacoustic effect : when a material is heated it expands . to perform measurements , a biological object is illuminated with a short electromagnetic pulse that heats the tissue and , through the resulting thermoacoustic expansion , generates an outgoing acoustic wave .",
    "acoustic pressure is then measured by detectors placed on a surface ( completely or partially ) surrounding the object .",
    "the source reconstruction inverse problem of tat / pat / oat  consists in finding the initial pressure within the object from the measurements .",
    "this pressure is closely related to the blood content in the tissues , making these imaging modalities particularly effective for cancer detection and imaging of blood vessels .    under the assumption that the speed of sound in the tissues is constant , for certain simple acquisition surfaces a solution of this inverse problem can be represented by explicit closed - form formulas .",
    "such formulas are similar to the well - known filtration / backprojection formula in x - ray tomography ; they allow one to compute the initial pressure by evaluating an explicit integro - differential operator at each node of a reconstruction grid . the existence and form of explicit inversion formulas are closely related to the shape of the data acquisition surface . for the simplest case of a planar surface ,",
    "explicit formulas have been known for several decades @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite found a filtration / backprojection formula that is valid for a plane , a 3d sphere and an infinite 3d cylinder . in  @xcite several different inversion formulas",
    "were derived for spherical acquisition surfaces in spaces of various dimensions . in @xcite explicit reconstruction formulas",
    "were obtained for detectors placed on a surface of a cube ( or square , in 2d ) or on surfaces of certain other polygons and polyhedra .",
    "several authors @xcite recently found explicit inversion formulas for the data measured from surfaces of an ellipse ( in 2d ) or an ellipsoid ( in 3d ) surrounding the object .",
    "these formulas can be further extended by continuity to an elliptic paraboloid or parabolic cylinder @xcite .",
    "certain more complicated polynomial surfaces ( including a paraboloid ) were considered in @xcite , although not all of these surfaces are attractive from a practical point of view , as they would require surrounding the object by several layers of detectors .",
    "in addition to the explicit formulas , there exist several reconstruction algorithms ( for closed acquisition surfaces ) based on various series expansions  @xcite .",
    "these techniques sometimes lead to very fast implementations ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; however , their efficient numerical implementation may require certain non - trivial computational skills .    in this paper",
    "we derive inversion formulas for acquisition schemes that use either linear arrays of point- or line- detectors , or two dimensional arrays of sensors partially surrounding the object .",
    "several experimental setups motivate our research .",
    "for example , in @xcite , linear detectors were arranged in a corner - like assembly rotated along the object .",
    "such a scheme requires inversion of series of 2d circular radon transforms with centers located on two perpendicular rays .",
    "a similar 3d problem sometime arises when optically scanned planar glass plate is used as an acoustic detector , as done by researchers from university college london ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the use of a single glass plate provides only a limited angle view of the object , leading to disappearance of some edges in the image . to eliminate such artifacts",
    ", one needs to repeat scanning with a detector repositioned to view the object at a different angle , or to add additional glass plates and/or acoustical mirrors .",
    "the methods of the present paper are applicable in the case of consecutive measurements",
    ". the acquisition scheme with multiple glass detectors may need to be modeled as a reverberating cavity due to multiple reflections of acoustic waves from the glass surfaces .",
    "the methods of the present paper are not applicable in such situation ; instead , the reader is referred to  @xcite .",
    "recently , linear arrays of point - like piezoelectric detectors started to gain popularity due to their fast rate of acquisition ( see  @xcite ) . similarly to planar arrays , one such linear assembly yields only limited - angle measurements , and one has to either use mirrors ( as is done in  @xcite ) , or to arrange several arrays around the object ( reflections from linear arrays can be neglected due to their smaller cross - section ) .",
    "in this paper we consider a 3d acquisition scheme where point detectors are located on the boundary of an infinite octant , and a similar 2d problem with detectors covering the boundary of an infinite angular sector with an opening angle @xmath2 , @xmath3 . in both cases",
    "it is assumed that reflection of acoustic waves from the detectors is either absent or negligible . unlike many of inversion formulas mentioned above , the formulas we derive are not of a filtration / backprojection type . instead , we obtain explicit expressions allowing one to recover from the measurements the classical radon projections of the unknown initial pressure .",
    "the latter function then is easily reconstructed by application of the well - known inverse radon transform .",
    "we assume throughout the paper that the attenuation of acoustic waves is negligible , and that the speed of sound in the tissues is constant ( and , thus , it can be set to 1 without loss of generality ) .",
    "this simplified model is acceptable in such important applications as breast imaging , and most of the formulas and algorithms mentioned in the introduction are based on these assumptions .",

    "in general , certain solutions of the wave equation can be represented by a combination of a single- and double- layer potentials .",
