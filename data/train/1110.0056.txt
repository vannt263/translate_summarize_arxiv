    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) play very important roles in astrophysics as a standard candle to measure cosmological distances as well as the production site of a large part of iron group elements .",
    "however , the nature of sn ia progenitors has not been clarified yet .",
    "it has been commonly agreed that the exploding star is a carbon - oxygen ( c+o ) white dwarf ( wd ) and the observed features of sne ia are better explained by the chandrasekhar mass model than the sub - chandrasekhar mass model .",
    "however , there has been no clear observational indication as to how the wd mass gets close enough to the chandrasekhar mass for carbon ignition ( @xmath0 ) , i.e. , whether the wd accretes h / he - rich matter from its binary companion [ single degenerate ( sd ) scenario ] or two c+o wds merge [ double degenerate ( dd ) scenario ] .",

    "the most important difference between gb10 and hkn10 is the number of wds in sss phase .",
    "gb10 derived expected sn ia rate for each galaxy , based on the k - band luminosity and assumed sn ia rate per k - band luminosity .",
    "then , gb10 derived the number of accreting wds , @xmath8 , assuming that all the wds always stay in the sss phase before a sn ia explosion ( e.g , it takes @xmath9 yrs for a 1.2 @xmath10 wd to increase its mass to the chandrasekhar mass with accretion rate of 1 @xmath11 yr@xmath12 ) .",
    "this assumption , that a wd is always in the sss phase , is however , very unlikely . in canonical sd scenario",
    "( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hachisu et al . 1999 ) ) , accreting wds usually spend a large fraction of the lifetime in the optically thick wind phase , then undergo the sss phase , and finally enter the rn phase .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( left ) shows a typical evolutional path of mass - accreting wd by the arrows , and figure [ fig1 ] ( right ) demonstrates that sss phase is relatively short in the total lifetime . in binary evolution calculations ,",
    "the secondary star decreases its mass because of mass transfer , and then the mass transfer rate to the wd naturally decreases with time .",
    "therefore , the wd evolves from the sss phase to rn phase as the wd mass increases .",
    "s assumed that wds always evolve along the narrow strip of steady h - burning ( i.e. , the mass accretion rate increases with time ) , but this is very artificial and highly unlikely .",
    "hkn10 followed evolution of a number of binaries with different binary parameters and found that the sss phase is as short as @xmath13 yr . using this value hkn10 recalculated @xmath8 with the same k - band luminosity and sn rate as gb10 , which is shown in the third column of table [ tab1 ] . comparing with the gb10 s estimates in the 2nd column ,",
    "the number is reduced by factor of 8 .",
    "second discrepancy between gb10 and hkn10 is the `` typical supersoft x - ray flux '' of candidate symbiotic stars .",
    "gb10 assumed absorbed x - ray flux @xmath14 to be 2 - 5 @xmath15 erg s@xmath12 per source as in the 4th column of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "these values are consistent with theoretical estimates if ( 1 ) the wd luminosity is @xmath16 erg  s@xmath12 , ( 2 ) the surface temperature is @xmath17 ev , ( 3 ) energy band of 0.3 - 0.7 kev , and ( 4 ) no absorption except the galactic one ( i.e. , no intrinsic absorption of symbiotic stars and no internal absorption within the early type galaxies ) . on the other hand , hkn10 adopted observation - based values , 3 - 7 @xmath18 erg s@xmath12 as listed in the 5th column of table [ tab1 ] ; these small values are derived from arithmetic mean of absorbed fluxes of smc3 and lin358 with corrected absorptions .",
    "symbiotic stars are rare supersoft x - ray sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are no strong supersoft x - ray symbiotic stars in the galaxy and lmc except the one of metal poor star .",
    "all the lmc steady h - burning wds are close binaries . in the smc ,",
    "two supersoft x - ray symbiotic stars are known : smc3 and lin358 .",
    "smc3 is the exceptionally bright sss among the symbiotics in our galaxy / the local group ( @xcite ) , whereas lin358 is a weak sss . as smc stars are metal poor , these observational facts suggest a possibility that symbiotics become bright sss only in the metal - poor circumstance ( j. mikoajewska 2011 : private communication at the conference ) .",
    "if this is the case , one can not expect a larger number of bright sss symbiotics in early type galaxies where metal is not poor . even if not , it is very unlikely that all the galaxies in table [ tab1 ] host a large number of symbiotic stars much brighter than the extraordinary bright x - ray symbiotic star , smc3 .",
    "table [ tab1 ] also shows the predicted supersoft x - ray fluxes for each galaxy , @xmath19 , which are obtained from the x - ray flux per source ( @xmath14 ) multiplied by the number of sources ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "estimates by gb10 ( 6th column of table [ tab1 ] ) are 40 - 70 times larger than those by hkn10 ( the last column ) .",
    "we see the values by hkn10 are quite consistent with the observational value , @xmath2 in 7th column .",
    "it should be stressed that we do nt know much about symbiotic stars , in steady burning , massive wds , except the fact of no stronger sss symbiotics than smc3 in nearby galaxies .",
    "then a question arises ; why symbiotic stars are so dark in supersoft x - rays ?",
    "in other words , what was inappropriate among the conditions ( 1)-(4 ) listed above ?",
    "one possibility is ( 4 ) absorption .",
    "symbiotic binaries could have high intrinsic absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is ( 2 ) temperature . for a low surface temperature , expected x - ray flux in a given energy band",
    "is sensitively reduced much due to low transparency . in symbiotic binaries ,",
    "a wd accretes matter from the red giant companion possibly in wind - fed accretion rather than in disk - accretion . with a high mass - accretion rate ,",
    "the wd atmosphere may be swollen up due to gravitational energy release and could have a much lower temperature than in steady burning wds with disk - fed - accretion ( like lmc ssss ) .",
    "in fact the wd temperature of the two smc symbiotics are in the lower side of temperature distribution of lmc ssss ( 20 - 80 ev ) ; @xmath20 ev ( @xcite ) and @xmath21 ev ( @xcite ) for smc3 , 19.6 ev for lin358 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the envelope is further swollen up , the temperature becomes too low to emit x - rays .",
    "therefore , the temperature of 45 ev ( gb10 s suggestion ) seems to be an upper limit and a much higher temperature is unlikely in symbiotic stars .",
    "however , note that we have only two samples and need more statistics / observational information .",
    "@xcite also claimed that observed number of novae in early type galaxies are much smaller than that expected from the sd scenario , and suggested that the sd scenario is not the major path to sne ia .",
    "my criticisms are as follows : ( 1 ) they confused the recurrent novae ( rne ) and classical novae ( cne ) , these two are in different binary evolutional paths .",
    "cne are not the candidate of sn ia , so the ratio of observed number of novae and expected number of rne has no scientific meaning .",
    "moreover , number of rne are highly unknown , but many undetected rn candidates are suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* strope et al . ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "( 2 ) they overestimated the `` expected number of rne  in the sd scenario in the same logic as in section 2 , i.e. , all the accreting wds keep staying in the rn phase ( not sss phase , this time ) during the lifetime .",
    "( 3 ) a large part of `` recurrent nova '' of figure [ fig1 ] may not correspond to a typical rn like rs oph , but may be like uv variables . because shell flashes are so weak as well as a large duty cycle ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sion & starrfield 1986 ) ) , these shell flashes may be very dark in optical wavelength and not identified as recurrent novae .",
    "considering these uncertainties , one may reduce statistically expected number of ' ' normal \" rn ( like rs oph ) by two order of magnitudes , and expected number of rn increase by a factor of 10 , which makes the @xcite s discrepancy almost vanish ."
