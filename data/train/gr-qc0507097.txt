    "as part of the research and development for the ligo  @xcite and tama  @xcite gravitational wave detectors , we have conducted investigations into the internal friction of fused silica .",
    "displacement of the interferometer s mirror faces arising from thermal motion of the fused silica test mass mirrors sets a fundamental limit to the detector sensitivity .",
    "the frequency distribution of this noise is directly related to the internal friction of the mirror material .",
    "an advanced ligo detector has recently been proposed  @xcite with better sensitivity than initial ligo .",
    "the advanced ligo mirror thermal noise must be as low as possible .",
    "two materials have been under consideration for the mirror substrate : fused silica and single crystal sapphire . to its advantage , sapphire has the higher young s modulus and a low bulk mechanical loss ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "however , sapphire also has high thermoelastic noise  @xcite .    in the advanced detectors , thermal noise in the mirror coatings makes a significant contribution to the total noise budget in the central frequency region of 30 - 500 hz .",
    "discussion on the mechanical loss in the mirror coatings can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "recent measurements on the mechanical loss in fused silica have revealed a dependence on frequency  @xcite and on surface - to - volume ratio  @xcite .",
    "this paper combines data from several of these research groups in order to model both of these effects .",
    "the frequency dependence of the loss agrees well with results from weidersich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "loss data spanning six decades in frequency is modeled by an asymmetric double - well potential in the bond angle .",
    "together these results provide a more complete picture of the loss in ultrapure glasses and a more physically motivated prediction for the thermal noise in advanced interferometric detectors .",
    "it was previously predicted that fused silica s loss dependence would make it suitable for low frequency detectors ( 10  100 hz )  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this model s prediction of a very low mechanical loss in the ligo frequency regime has motivated the recent selection of fused silica as the advanced ligo test mass substrate  @xcite .",
    "the thermal noise motion of the mirror surface is related to the internal friction of the substrate by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite .",
    "the internal friction of very pure fused silica is associated with strained si - o - si bonds , where the energy of the bond has minima at two different bond angles , forming an asymmetric double - well potential .",
    "redistribution of the bond angles in response to an applied strain leads to mechanical dissipation , which at audio frequencies has a peak in the cryogenic range 20 - 60k . because fused silica is an amorphous material ,",
    "there is a distribution of potentials which must be inferred from measurements of the dissipation .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the frequency dependence of the loss should exhibit a power law spectrum with exponent @xmath1 at low temperatures .",
    "both this power law , with @xmath2 , and the distribution of potentials have been measured  @xcite .",
    "the power law exponent of a relaxation process can not exceed 1 , and is expected to saturate near 300 k. at room temperature the exponent is 0.76 .    at elevated temperatures there is another loss peak arising from a double - well potential associated with the si - o - si bond angles .",
    "for this peak the bond angle shift and potential barrier are much larger ; the double - well of the cryogenic loss peak is a small feature at the minima of this larger potential well . at room temperature ,",
    "thermal fluctuations allow the bonds to span the cryogenic double - well but not to cross the larger potential barrier , where @xmath3@xcite . the calculated internal friction for this loss peak at audio frequencies and room temperature is utterly negligible compared to other loss mechanisms cited herein .",
    "a separate loss mechanism exists in the surface of the glass .",
    "the contribution from the surface loss depends on the mode of the sample .",
    "the total energy lost per oscillation in an isotropic sample undergoing slowly decaying vibration , can be described by the integral of the local loss angle,@xmath4 with the energy density @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the sample volume . assuming that the local loss angle is constant and equal to @xmath8 everywhere except within a distance @xmath9 of the surface , and that the energy density in that surface layer is approximately the energy density at the surface , then the loss can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the surface area of the sample and @xmath12 is a factor of order unity that depends on the mode shape .",
    "the surface loss parameter , @xmath13 , is typically several picometers for flame polished or flame drawn fused silica but much higher for abrasively polished surfaces .",
    "the measurements at syracuse university ( su )  @xcite were performed on fiber / rod samples with diameters ranging from 0.1  8 mm over resonant frequencies less than 5 khz .",
    "the samples were drawn from and left attached to a massive bob of suprasil  @xcite , thus forming a cantilever beam .",
    "this bob was welded to a vibration isolating suspension formed by similar silica bobs connected by thin silica fibers . in a vacuum of @xmath14 torr ,",
    "the samples were made resonant by an electrostatic comb exciter , and their position was measured using a shadow sensor .",
    "the measurements at university of tokyo  @xcite were performed on cylindrical samples with optically polished surfaces .",
    "the diameters and heights were 70 mm and 60 mm , respectively .",
    "the samples were annealed in a vacuum furnace . to exclude the support loss ,",
    "the samples were supported at nodal points of their vibrational modes during the @xmath15 measurements .",
    "the caltech measurements were performed on a spare input test mass for the initial ligo interferometers , a superpolished right cylinder made from suprasil  312 with a diameter of 25.4  cm and a thickness of 10  cm .",
    "it was suspended in a @xmath14  torr vacuum by a loop of polished stainless steel wire greased with lard .",
    "the elastic modes of the mass were excited with an electrostatic actuator and the mode amplitude was monitored using a birefringence sensor . since friction at the wire could reduce @xmath15 , only modes with small motion at the point of wire contact were used in the fit .",
    "resonant @xmath15 measurements from each of the labs were submitted for generating this model of the loss .",
    "the measurements spanned several types of fused silica , v / s ratios from 0.03  28 mm , and frequency up to @xmath16 hz .",
    "the data was first separated by silica type since the loss is known to vary significantly between varieties of fused silica  @xcite . only suprasil 2 and 312 had sufficient data to warrant a fit over both frequency and v / s ratio .",
    "characteristics of these samples are listed in table  [ tbl : data ] .",
    ".sample characteristics : _ type _ lists heraeus suprasil variety and shape .",
    "samples are cylinders with diameter ( d ) , height ( h ) , and volume - to - surface ratio ( v / s ) given in mm .",
    "surface types are superpolished ( sp ) and flame polished ( fp ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the low mechanical loss of silica in the 10  1000  hz bandwidth , coupled with its optical and thermal properties , makes it an attractive material for the optics of next generation interferometric gravitational wave detectors .",
    "fused silica has recently been chosen as the test mass substrate for advanced ligo  @xcite , which has been approved and recommended for funding by the us national science foundation .    if the bulk and surface loss predicted herein can be achieved , the mirror thermal noise in advanced ligo with fused silica mirrors will likely be dominated by the coating  @xcite .",
    "the mirror thermal noise contributions to the total advanced ligo noise budget are shown in figure  [ fig : bench1 ] .",
    "table  [ tbl : reach ] shows the predicted sensitivity of advanced ligo with silica optics to two possible sources of gravitational waves : binary neutron star inspirals ( bnsi ) and binary 10 @xmath17 black hole inspirals .",
    "two different scenarios of coating thermal noise are shown : the best measurements to date  @xcite and the research goal .",
    "the sensitivity goal for a single advanced ligo interferometer is to observe bnsi , averaged over sky position and polarization , to a distance of @xmath18 200  mpc .",
    "( see harry  @xcite for a description of a ligo range calculation . )",
    "we have shown that the mechanical loss of fused silica can be described by a model that includes surface loss and a frequency dependent bulk loss .",
    "the frequency dependent loss , thought to arise from an asymmetric double - well potential of the bond angle , agrees well with earlier measurements  @xcite that spanned six decades in frequency .",
    "this improved understanding of the loss indicates that at large geometries and low frequency , fused silica is an excellent material for test masses in advanced interferometric gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the authors would like to thank the ligo laboratory and ligo science collaboration for their support and review of this work .",
