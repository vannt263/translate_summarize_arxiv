    "broadband photometric selection is an increasingly common technique to identify high redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "one particularly powerful combination is to use optical and near - infrared passbands , typically @xmath10 or @xmath11 and @xmath12 , to identify galaxies with a strong decline in their spectral energy distributions ( sed ) at wavelengths around 1@xmath13 m .",
    "these sources display extremely red optical - near - infrared colours , e.g.  @xmath14 , and as such are termed extremely red objects ( eros ) .",
    "this strong spectral decline could either result from a break in the sed or the suppression of bluer light due to strong dust absorption . as we look at more distant galaxies , the first spectral break strong enough to produce",
    "such a red colour is the 4000  break , which falls between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 passbands at @xmath15 .",
    "progressively bluer features , such as the balmer break ( 3625   ) and lyman - limit ( 912   ) , will fall in the relevant wavelength range for higher redshift sources , although these will typically be fainter than those systems selected on the basis of the 4000  break . similarly ,",
    "the dusty systems within the ero population are also expected to lie at high redshifts , due to the strong wavelength dependence of dust reddening combined with the redshifting of uv light into the optical passbands .",
    "ero surveys thus enable us to identify both the most and least active galaxies at @xmath16 , and hence provide a powerful probe of obscured star formation at @xmath16 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s02 ) as well as the nature of the evolved descendants of some of the earliest phases of star formation in the universe @xcite .    unfortunately",
    ", the mixed nature of the ero population , compounded by the strong angular clustering of one or both sub - populations , has led to a vigorous debate about the relative importance of the evolved and active components in the overall ero population (;",
    "s02 ) .    the deepest ero surveys undertaken show a rapidly increasing surface density of sources as a function of magnitude limit down to @xmath8 .",
    "fainter than this , the increase in the numbers of eros with apparent magnitude slows dramatically @xcite .",
    "this transition is very abrupt and suggests that there may be a profound change in the nature of the eros fainter than @xmath8 , perhaps associated with a variation in the relative proportion of passive and active systems at fainter magnitudes ( @xcite ; s02 ) . to investigate this possibility we need an observational test to distinguish between the different sub - classes of eros .",
    "there are three approaches which have been used to attempt to differentiate passive from dusty / active eros : photometric tests , dust - insensitive star formation indicators and morphological classification .",
    "the photometric classification of eros was popularised by @xcite , using @xmath17-band photometry to separate the two sub - classes on the @xmath18@xmath19 plane .",
    "subsequent application of this test to various samples has led to the conclusion that the population at @xmath20 is roughly equally split between the dusty / active and passive sub - classes (; see also ) .",
    "unfortunately , without an independent test of this classification scheme it is hard to know how reliable these conclusions are .",
    "searches for millimetric and radio emission from samples of eros have also been used to attempt to estimate the proportion of dust - obscured star - forming eros in the overall population (;",
    "@xcite ; s02 ) .",
    "however , these star - formation indicators , while being insensitive to dust obscuration in the galaxies , are only capable of detecting the most vigorously star - forming systems at @xmath16 . as a result",
    "they provide only a lower - limit of @xmath21% and @xmath22% ( s02 ) on the proportion of star - forming systems in the ero population .",
    "s02 also compare the colours of their radio - selected star - forming eros with those expected for dusty star - forming and passive galaxies and find that most fall on or within the model classification boundary for dusty galaxies , providing some support for the @xcite scheme .",
    "the final observable which has been used to differentiate between evolved and active ero populations is their morphologies .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the passive eros will have elliptical or at least early - type morphologies , while star - forming galaxies are expected to exhibit either a disk - like , disturbed or obviously interacting morphology @xcite .",
    "morphological studies of very red galaxies have indeed shown that some have elliptical morphologies @xcite .",
    "however , results on statistical samples of eros have produced more mixed conclusions , with and @xcite claiming a high early - type fraction and more recent work by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter yt03 ) arguing for a more equal mix of early - type and later - type / disturbed systems . by comparing this classification scheme with those described above it",
    "is possible to test the reliability of the different approaches for a large sample of eros ( c.f .",
    "we highlight the study of yt03 which has very similar goals to those described in this paper .",
    "their work utilised high resolution _",
    "wfpc2 f814w - band imaging to morphologically classify a sample of 115 @xmath23 eros selected from ground - based @xmath24-band imaging to a 5-@xmath25 depth of @xmath26 .",
    "the authors visually classified their objects and found a mix of around 30:64:6 for bulge dominated , disk dominated and unclassified classes , with around 17% of the sample showing signs of merger / strong interaction .",
    "they showed their visual estimates to be in generally good agreement with an automated bulge@xmath27disk decomposition technique .",
    "the key improvement of our study over that of  is that our near - infrared imaging is sufficiently deep to probe beyond the break in the ero counts at @xmath28 .",
    "we also improve upon their work through the addition of multicolour photometry to test the different techniques for subclassification of the ero population .",
    "we discuss our near - infrared observations of a selected sample of deep _ hubble space telescope _ wfpc2 images in  2 , present our analysis of these in  3 and the results which this provides are presented and discussed in  4 , before giving our conclusions in  5 . throughout",

    "a common misconception is that the key to a successful ero survey is to obtain deep nir imaging  in fact , the observationally most demanding aspect is achieving the necessary depth in the optical to identify that a galaxy is an ero . for this reason ,",
    "we have chosen to concentrate our survey on fields for which deep , high - quality optical imaging already exists .",

    "how do the different criteria affect the mix of objects selected ?",
    "the ero number counts for samples selected by a variety of definitions ( e.g.  @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) are in broad agreement ( e.g.  fig .  7 of ) , and in addition the @xmath4020 break in the counts is seen in sufficiently deep data selected by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( this work ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "however , a direct comparison of the details of the samples such as the relative morphological mixes of eros using different colour selection has yet to be addressed .",
    "the difference between the @xmath44 and @xmath18 colour cuts can be examined for a subsample of our ero sample with f606w data .",
    "f606w can be approximately transformed to the cousins @xmath10 passband using @xmath45f606w@xmath46f606w@xmath47f814w@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this results in 27 eros with measurable @xmath49 photometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rik ] ) .",
    "only three of the @xmath41 selected eros are bluer in @xmath50 than the typical selection criterion of @xmath51 .",
    "one of these sources is very close to the selection boundary and would be found using the @xmath52 criterion , and may even be found with the former criterion , given the uncertainty in the f606w to @xmath49 transformation .",
    "the remaining two eros have @xmath53 and would not .",
    "thus , @xmath5490% of our eros would also be selected in an @xmath50 ero survey ( in agreement with s02 who found a value of 93% ) , suggesting that @xmath55 is a less stringent ero requirement than @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , for this admittedly small sample , all the galaxies dropping out of the ero category when selected in @xmath44 are disks , which supports the suggestion by  that @xmath18 selected ero surveys may preferentially include disks . to quantitatively compare the different morphological mixes found by the two techniques",
    "requires @xmath10 and @xmath11 band data and _ hst _ morphologies on the same regions of sky ( e.g.  gilbank et al .  in prep ) .",
    "we also performed visual classifications of the eros in f606w to compare with the morphologies derived from the f814w images .",
    "we find for the 27 eros with sufficient signal for f606w photometry : 8 of these are too faint to morphologically classify ; 10 of these are disk - like in f606w and were also disk - like in f814w ; 2 galaxies were compact and disk - like in f814w and were simply compact in f606w ; 5 galaxies appear lsb and disturbed in f606w whereas these systems were just classed as disk - like in f814w ; one galaxy appears amorphous in f606w and disk - like in f814w .",
    "one ero classed as compact and disk - like in f606w was classed as compact and symmetrical in f814w ( nominally a bulge class ) .",
    "this represents the only discrepancy between our notional bulge and disk classes , but the difference is slight as in both passbands the object is compact and symmetric .",
    "thus , the agreement between the f814w and f606w visual morphologies is very good .",
    "there is a tendency for the disks in the latter to exhibit more disturbed morphologies , as would be expected as the f606w probes further into the extreme ultraviolet , in each eros rest - frame .",
    "this agreement between passbands is reassuring , as f606w at z@xmath56 corresponds to the same rest - frame wavelength as f814w at z@xmath57  a plausible redshift spread for the ero sample .",
    "for this small subsample , we only find one ( marginal ) bulge  disk misclassification , whereas we assume poisson uncertainties on all our measured fractions throughout this work .",

    "points are labelled according to their visual morphologies in broad classes  disk - like , bulge - like , or unclassified .",
    "vertical error bars represent only the error in the f606w photometry and do not account for the uncertainty in the transformation to @xmath49 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath60 selection criterion is less stringent than @xmath61 .",
    ", width=321 ]      our visual and quantitative analysis of the morphological mix of our ero catalogue suggests that the ero population at @xmath62 is dominated by galaxies with disk - like morphologies ( 54% of the total sample ) , with eros with bulge - like or compact morphologies making up around a further quarter and a modest fraction ( @xmath63% ) of eros with disturbed , merging or amorphous morphologies .",
    "as we have shown , this distribution is similar to that found by previous studies (;",
    "@xcite ) . in contrast",
    ", our faint ero subsample , with @xmath6420 , has a lower fraction of disk - like eros , down to less than a third , with the fractions of the other classes effectively unchanged and the decline in the disk - like eros being made up for by a corresponding increase in the fraction of those with amorphous , merger or unclassified morphologies .",
    "our quantitative tests of this evolution confirm that the apparent decline in the disk - like fraction is real and is not due to our inability to classify faint examples of this population .",
    "we can now ask what limits we can place on the proportion of the ero population arising from galaxies which are red due to dust - obscuration and what fraction comes from evolved , passive systems .",
    "we use our visual classifications to divide our sample into star - forming or passive eros by taking extreme values in the following way .",
    "we assume that the minimum fraction of star - forming eros is given by all the disk - like galaxies ( although note that passive disks are also likely ,   [ sec : phot - redsh ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the maximum star - forming fraction is given by all the galaxies which could plausibly harbour star - formation ( including the disks , amorphous , mergers and _ all _ the unclassified objects ) .",
    "in the same way we associate all bulge - like eros with passive systems and add all compact and unclassified sources to this to generate an upper limit .",
    "we thus find 5477% star - forming and 1931% passive eros in the bright subsample ( @xmath65 ) , and 2971% star - forming and 1358% passive in the faint sample ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "for the full sample these numbers are 3873% and 1548% for star - forming and passive eros , respectively .",
    "s02 ( based on an ero sample selected using @xmath38 ) used deep radio data to estimate the fraction of star forming eros , finding a value of @xmath67% , to @xmath68 .",
    "this is compatible with our estimate based on morphologies .",
    "furthermore , they used photometric sed fitting to assess the fraction of dusty galaxies , placed a firm lower limit of @xmath69% , and estimated that possibly @xmath70% of this ero population could be dusty star - forming galaxies . again",
    ", this does not contradict our findings .    in the discussion above",
    ", it is the increasing fraction of morphologically unclassified eros in the faintest samples which produces the greatest uncertainty in the evolutionary trends we derive .",
    "these galaxies make up a quarter of the @xmath6420 sample and appear to also be responsible for the reddening of the whole ero population at @xmath71 , especially when balanced against the declining fraction of bluer , disk - like eros ( table  [ table : medcols ] ) .",
    "it is tempting to associate this population with the counterparts to the dusty , active sources selected in the sub - mm waveband ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the confirmation of this will have to await complimentary multiwavelength and morphological studies , with the latter either benefiting from the higher red sensitivity of the new acs camera on - board _ hst _ and the revival of the nicmos near - infrared imaging capability of _",
    "hst_.      assuming the median photometric redshift ( @xmath72 ) for our sample , the break around @xmath64 corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath73 . for the star - forming population",
    ", we correct this value for reddening to give @xmath74 .",
    "this unobscured luminosity corresponds approximately to an @xmath75 galaxy today . conservatively assuming no further star - formation activity in these galaxies between @xmath76 and the present day ( and no substantial merging )",
    ", these galaxies would actually correspond to sub-@xmath75 galaxies at @xmath77 . similarly ,",
    "if we adopt passive evolution models for the passive / bulge population , then @xmath64 at @xmath76 corresponds to an @xmath75 elliptical today .    taking the range of our photometric redshifts ( @xmath78 , ignoring the two outliers ) we derive a comoving volume for our survey of @xmath79mpc@xmath80 .",
    "this gives a space density for our full ero sample of @xmath81mpc@xmath80 .",
    "this is only a crude estimate since we do not know the true redshift distributions of the galaxies , and furthermore , the redshift distributions of the dusty star - forming and passive eros are unlikely to be the same .",
    "thus we use only an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "this number density agrees to this level with that derived locally from sdss@xmath272mass data for @xmath82 galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , the ero population could plausibly account for a sizable fraction ( @xmath83 , and potentially all ) of the stars seen in luminous ( @xmath84 ) galaxies locally .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the ero counts with a variety of evolution models was undertaken by @xcite , who compared their ero counts with pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) and semi - analytic hierarchical galaxy formation models .",
    "the only model to correctly reproduce the cumulative ero number counts was one in which the ero population was modelled as a single population of passive galaxies .",
    "this model now clearly overestimates the number of passive eros as we have been shown that a sizable fraction of the eros are not simple passive systems .",
    "the more realistic models examined by @xcite ",
    "ple with a mixture of galaxy types and semi - analytic galaxy formation models  both under - predicted the number of eros by around an order of magnitude .",
    "a comparison with these models is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented in future work .",
    "we note briefly that more recent semi - analytic models , which include bursts of star formation at high redshift absent in the @xcite reference model , now reproduce the number counts for @xmath85 eros ( c.  baugh , priv .  comm . ) .",
    "unfortunately , the numbers of objects in redder subsamples ( e.g.   @xmath86 ) are still underestimated by around an order of magnitude .",
    "the requirement of these starbursts at higher redshift ( which is also indicated by the presence of luminous , passive galaxies at z@xmath87 ) is consistent with the interpretation of scuba sources as protoelliptical galaxies in the process of formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have compiled a new catalogue of @xmath12-selected extremely red objects in regions with deep _ hst _ @xmath88-band observations .",
    "we apply a number of tests to examine the nature of the ero population and investigate the origin of the turnover in the ero number counts around @xmath89 .",
    "the main aim of our work is to study the morphologies of our eros using the exquisite resolution of the _ hst_. however , for a subsample of our dataset with multicolour data we can also utilise sed - fitting as a classification tool .",
    "hence , we were able to examine the commonly applied hypothesis that the passive population defined by multicolour photometry ( or equally spectral line diagnostics ) is associated with bulge - dominated morphologies ; and that eros with the colours of dusty star - forming galaxies have disk - like / irregular morphologies .",
    "we find a surface density of @xmath55 eros @xmath3 arcmin@xmath4 at @xmath2 .",
    "the number count slope flattens from @xmath90 for @xmath65 to @xmath91 for @xmath66 , in good agreement with other surveys in the literature .",
    "this turnover in the number counts is associated with a reddening of the faint ero population , from a median colour of @xmath92 at @xmath65 to @xmath93 at 19.0@xmath9420.0 .",
    "our visual morphological fractions at the bright end ( k@xmath9519.0 ) are in good agreement with @xcite , and we extend this sample to fainter depths , finding a mix of 35% disk - like , 15% disturbed / irregular , 30% spheroidal or compact and 20% unclassifiable .",
    "using quantitative measures , we find that the concentrations of eros evolves across the break in their number counts , such that the fraction of disk - like galaxies declines .    \\5 .",
    "we find on the basis of @xmath96 colours , using the scheme of @xcite , that most disk - like and amorphous galaxies are associated with dusty star - formation activity , and most bulge - like and compact sources have the colours of passive stellar populations .",
    "however , @xmath9730% of disks appear to have the colours of passive stellar populations .",
    "these are probably genuinely passive disks or at least have substantial evolved stellar populations .",
    "we also fit the seds of our eros finding slightly better agreement between the morphological classification and the expected star - formation activity of such morphological types , than the @xcite classification , i.e.  most disk - like eros exhibit photometric signs of recent star - formation .    \\7 . for a subsample of our eros we derive sed - fitted photometric redshift distributions with a median of @xmath98 , in reasonable agreement with spectroscopic redshifts of small samples of somewhat brighter eros .",
    "we have highlighted the diversity of extremely red objects , comparing morphological and photometric classification schemes .",
    "we suggest that the apparent break in ero counts at k@xmath9719 is due to a rapid rise in bluer disk eros at bright magnitudes . the dominance of this population declines as it is joined around @xmath99 by a more modestly increasing population of galaxies comprising bulges , amorphous , merging and increasingly unclassifiable systems . we have shown that these blue disk eros have properties not inconsistent with them being at the same redshifts as the rest of the other ero sub - populations .",
    "the next steps in understanding the nature of the ero population are : spectroscopic follow up of a large sample of faint eros ( building on the initial work of at brighter magnitudes ) in order to obtain star formation rates , extinction values and redshift distributions ( particularly to understand the bluer disk - like eros ) ; and a detailed comparison with semi - analytic and other galaxy formation models .",

    "<S> using a quantitative measure of morphology , we find that the ero morphological distribution evolves across the break in their counts , such that low concentration ( disk - like ) galaxies decline . </S>",
    "<S> we relate the morphological and colour information for our eros and conclude that those eros morphologically classified as bulges do indeed possess seds consistent with passive stellar populations ; while eros with dusty star - forming seds are mostly associated with disk - like and peculiar galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath9 of disk eros reside in the passive region of i / j / k colour - colour space </S>",
    "<S> . these could be either genuinely passive systems , lower redshift contaminants to the high - z ero population , or systems with composite star - forming and passive seds . </S>",
    "<S> we use photometric redshifts for our high s / n multicolour photometry and derive redshift distributions in good agreement with spectroscopic work of somewhat brighter ero examples .    </S>",
