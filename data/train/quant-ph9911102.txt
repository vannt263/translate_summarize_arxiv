    "quantum information theory is closely related to quantum measurement theory because one must perform measurement to obtain information on a quantum system .",
    "in particular , a limit of quantum measurement is also a limit of getting information on a quantum system . among many possible limits of quantum measurement ,",
    "the simplest ones were derived directly from the uncertainty principles . however , _ such simple limits are not the only limits_. i here suggest a new limit which comes from the forms and the strengths of the elementary interactions .",
    "it is established that measurement of a quantum system can be analyzed ( except for philosophical issues ) as interaction processes of the system and the measuring apparatus @xcite .",
    "many interesting quantities , such as a measurement error and backaction of the measurement , can be calculated from the dynamics of the total quantum system composed of the system and the measuring apparatus @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a quantum system is governed by the commutation relations _ and _ the hamiltonian . for the interaction hamiltonian @xmath0 ,",
    "it was often _ assumed _ in the literature @xcite that the form of @xmath0 was obtained by `` quantizing '' some classical hamiltonian . or , in some cases @xcite",
    ", specific forms were _ just assumed _ for @xmath0 .",
    "discussions based on such @xmath0 may be consistent _",
    "mathematically_. physically , however , such @xmath0 can be wrong .",
    "for example , quantization of a classical hamiltonian in general gives a form that is different from the true hamiltonian , and the difference is typically of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "however , backaction is also of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , physically , any results drawn from such a hamiltonian can not be reliable enough .",
    "in particular , _ there are only four types of elementary interactions in nature _ ; their forms are determined by the gauge invariance ( and symmetry breaking ) , and their coupling constants ( in the low - energy regime ) have definite values @xcite . in order to draw conclusions which are physically meaningful",
    ", one must either use these true interactions , or , if one uses an approximate hamiltonian , one must confirm that the approximation does not alter the results for the measurement . unfortunately , however , these points were not examined carefully . in this paper ,",
    "i point out that not only the commutation relations but also the limitation of available interactions in nature results in a fundamental limit of quantum measurement .",
    "this fundamental limit imposes the fundamental limits of getting information on , preparing , and controlling quantum systems .",
    "i consider the relation between the measurement error and the backaction _ on the measured observable_. although similar arguments should be applicable to other relations , i here present only one example , to explain the basic ideas .",
    "when one measures an observable @xmath2 of a quantum system , there is a finite measurement error @xmath3 in general .",
    "its magnitude is determined by the form and strength of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath0 between the measured system and the measuring apparatus @xcite .",
    "there are also backactions of the measurement .",
    "a well - known backaction is the one on the conjugate variable @xmath4 of @xmath2 .",
    "its lower limit is determined by the commutation relation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , i.e. , by the uncertainty principle .",
    "however , i here discuss backaction on @xmath2 _ itself _ @xcite , which is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "although the `` ideal measurement '' , for which @xmath6 , is normally _ assumed _ in textbook quantum mechanics , real measurements are non - ideal in general , for which @xmath5 and/or @xmath3 are finite @xcite . since the lower limit of @xmath5 is not ( directly ) limited by the uncertainty principle , @xmath5 strongly depends on the form and strength of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath0 @xcite , just as @xmath3 does . therefore , @xmath5 and @xmath3 are correlated through @xmath0 .",
    "for this relation , one could not get physically correct results without using a correct hamiltonian .",
    "for example , if one _ assumes _ some @xmath0 which satisfies @xmath7 = 0,\\ ] ] then @xmath8 , independent of the strength ( which may be expressed by the coupling constant @xmath9 ) of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "namely , the measurement becomes of the first kind ( fk ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath3 tends to increase as @xmath9 is decreased : for example , @xmath10 as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "hence , one would conclude that @xmath12 however , this is true only for such a hypothetical @xmath0 .",
    "namely , if @xmath7 \\neq 0\\ ] ] for the true form of @xmath0 ( i.e. , for the elementary interaction ) , then @xmath5 strongly depends on the form and strength of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the correct conclusion is @xmath13 in sharp contrast to ( [ wrong ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , most previous work on measurement @xcite assumed some `` effective '' interactions for @xmath0 , such as a photon - photon interaction , which is not the true form , the elementary interaction .",
    "the validity of such effective forms , when applied to problems of measurement , was not examined carefully .",
    "from this viewpoint , of particular interest is the measurement of a gauge field such as the photon field .",
    "the form of its interaction is completely determined by the requirement of the gauge invariance : the only interaction is the gauge - invariant interaction with the matter field @xcite .",
    "however , most previous work on measurement of a gauge field , particularly work on the `` quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement '' of photons @xcite , assumed other forms for @xmath0 , such as a photon - photon interaction , as `` effective '' interactions . here , the qnd measurement is the fk measurement for a conserved observable , i.e. , for @xmath2 that is conserved during the free motion ( i.e. , while the system is decoupled from the measuring apparatus ) @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems that most previous discussions on measurement of a gauge field need to be reconsidered .        to demonstrate the dramatic difference between the correct result derived from a proper @xmath0 and a wrong result derived from an `` effective '' @xmath0 , i will present results for the qnd photodetector proposed in refs .  [",
    "3,4 ] , for both cases where the true @xmath0 and an `` effective '' @xmath0 are used .",
    "a schematic diagram of the qnd photodetector is shown in fig.1 @xcite . before going to the full analysis in the following sections ,",
    "i here give an intuitive , semi - classical description of the operation principle @xcite .",
    "the device is composed of two quantum wires , n and w , which constitute an electron interferometer .",
    "the lowest subband energies ( of the @xmath14-direction confinement ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the wires are the same , but the second levels @xmath17 and @xmath18 are different .",
    "electrons occupy the lowest levels only .",
    "a @xmath14-polarized light beam hits the dotted region .",
    "the photon energy @xmath19 is assumed to satisfy @xmath20 , so that real excitation does not occur and no photons are absorbed .",
    "however , the electrons are excited  virtually \" @xcite , and the electron wavefunction undergoes a phase shift between its amplitudes in the two wires . since the magnitude of the virtual excitation is proportional to the light intensity @xcite ,",
    "so is the phase shift .",
    "this phase shift modulates the interference currents , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . by measuring @xmath23",
    ", we can know the magnitude of the phase shift , from which we can know the light intensity .",
    "since the light intensity is proportional to the photon number @xmath24 , we can get information on @xmath24 .",
    "we thus get to know @xmath24 without photon absorption , i.e. , without changing @xmath24 ; hence the name qnd .",
    "( more precisely , the distribution of @xmath24 over the whole ensemble is unchanged , whereas @xmath24 of each element of the ensemble is changed due to the `` reduction '' of the wavefunction .",
    "see , e.g. , section 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in contrast , conventional photodetectors drastically alter the photon number by absorbing photons . keeping this semi - classical argument in mind ,",
    "let us proceed to a fully - quantum analysis .",
    "as explained above , the essential role of the photon field is to modulate the electron phase .",
    "it is thus tempting to employ the following form @xmath25 as an `` effective '' interaction hamiltonian . here",
    ", @xmath26 denotes the annihilation operator of an electron of wavelength @xmath27 in quantum wire @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is an effective coupling constant .",
    "this hamiltonian commutes with the photon number @xmath24 ; @xmath30 = 0 .",
    "\\label{commute}\\ ] ] this equation , and the fact that @xmath24 is conserved during the free evolution , meet the condition for qnd detectors that were claimed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is then easy to show that the backaction @xmath31 , whereas the measurement error @xmath32 is finite and dependent on @xmath29 .",
    "namely , we obtain conclusion ( [ wrong ] ) for the interaction hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "the correct interaction ( i.e. , the elementary interaction of , in this case , quantum electrodynamics ) is not the form of eq .  ( [ heff ] ) , but the following one @xcite ; @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the ( relativistic ) electron field , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) are the gamma matrices , @xmath37 is the electromagnetic potential ( the set of the vector potential and scalar potential ) , and @xmath38 .",
    "this form is uniquely determined by the local gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the value of the coupling constant @xmath39 ( more precisely , the renormalized value at the low energy region ) is uniquely determined by experiment @xcite . since @xmath24 is quadratic in @xmath37 , we find @xmath30 \\neq 0 , \\label{notcommute}\\ ] ] in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ commute ] ) .",
    "hence , the qnd condition claimed in refs .",
    "@xcite is _ not _",
    "satisfied by the correct hamiltonian . according to the detailed analysis on qnd measurement @xcite , the condition claimed in refs .",
    "@xcite is the strongest one among various possibilities , which are called the strong , moderate , and weak conditions @xcite .",
    "the weak condition given in ref .",
    "@xcite can be slightly generalized to the following form @xcite ( which reduces to that of ref .  @xcite as @xmath40 ) : for a small positive number @xmath41 , @xmath42 for some set of @xmath43 s and for some @xmath44 . here",
    ", i have used the same notations as in ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath43 and @xmath44 represent the initial states of the measured system and the `` probe '' system , respectively , i.e. , the expansion coefficients in terms of the eigenfunctions of the measured and `` readout '' variables @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45 is the matrix representation of the unitary evolution induced by the interaction with the probe system , hence is a function of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "physically , this condition means that the backaction can be made small enough for a particular set of measured states if the measuring apparatus is appropriately designed .",
    "the magnitude of the backaction is represented by @xmath41 , which gives the upper limit of the change of the probability distribution over the ensemble @xcite .",
    "note that the limitation of measured states corresponds to a limitation of the response range of the measuring apparatus .",
    "such a limitation is quite realistic , because _ any _ existing apparatus do have finite response ranges .",
    "furthermore , as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ notcommute ] ) , _ only by accepting such a limitation can we realize the fk or qnd measurement of wide classes of observables _ including photon number .",
    "the condition satisfied by the qnd photodetector of fig .",
    "1 is this ( generalized ) weak condition .",
    "in fact , the backaction @xmath46 which is induced by the qnd detector of fig .  1 is evaluated as @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) denotes a constant that is determined by the structures of the quantum wires and the optical waveguide , @xmath50 is the number of electrons detected as the interference current , @xmath51 is the detuning energy , and @xmath52 denotes the optical - pulse duration ( which is assumed , for simplicity , to be longer than @xmath53 of ref .",
    "it is seen that for a small positive number @xmath41 , one can make @xmath54 by taking @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and/or @xmath50 small enough .",
    "this corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ weak ] ) .",
    "namely , the ( generalized ) weak condition ( [ weak ] ) for the qnd measurement is indeed satisfied . in other words ,",
    "the qnd measurement is possible for a certain set of photon states ( i.e. , for photon states whose pulse duration @xmath52 is longer than some value ) if the structure of the device is appropriately designed ( which determines @xmath57 and @xmath50 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the measurement error @xmath32 is evaluated as @xcite @xmath58 this dependence on @xmath50 is a general result for quantum interference devices @xcite .",
    "it is seen that for a small positive number @xmath59 , one can make @xmath60 by taking @xmath55 , @xmath57 , @xmath50 , and/or @xmath61 large enough . however , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ ba ] ) , their increase results in the increase of the backaction .",
    "therefore , the backaction ( not on the conjugate observable , but on the photon number itself ) and the measurement error are strongly correlated : _ one can not make @xmath32 ( @xmath46 ) smaller without accepting the increase of @xmath46 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "_ this correct conclusion , derived from the correct hamiltonian ( [ qed ] ) , should be contrasted with the wrong result obtained from the `` effective '' hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "because of this unavoidable correlation , one must make some optimization . for example",
    ", if one wishes to achieve @xmath62 then the qnd detector can be designed in such a way that @xcite @xmath63 in this case , eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) is satisfied if @xmath64 hence , the lower boundary @xmath65 of the response range of the qnd detector is found to be @xmath66 . on the other hand , the upper limit @xmath67 of the response range",
    "is evaluated in this case as @xmath68 , which is derived from the requirement that the phase shift of an electron should be less than @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eps ] ) is satisfied for all values of @xmath61 between @xmath65 and @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 is smaller than the `` standard quantum limit '' @xmath70 @xcite , throughout this range .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the information entropy @xmath71 that can be obtained by the qnd detector .",
    "since @xmath32 is independent of @xmath61 , the number of different values of @xmath61 that can be distinguished by this qnd detector is simply given by @xmath72 hence , @xmath71 is estimated as @xmath73 this should be contrasted with the wrong conclusion @xmath74 that would be obtained from the `` effective hamiltonian '' ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "we have obtained the correct value of @xmath71 because we have taken account of the strong correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath32 .",
    "since this correlation comes from the form of the gauge interaction , similar correlation should also be present for any measuring apparatus of any gauge field .",
    "therefore , similar optimization of the apparatus is necessary , and the response range and the information entropy would be finite , for any measuring apparatus of any gauge field .",
    "the above example clearly demonstrates that the limitation of available interactions in nature gives rise to a fundamental limit of quantum measurement .",
    "i discuss possible consequences of this fundamental limit .",
    "clearly , it imposes a fundamental limit of getting information on quantum systems because the `` ideal measurement '' ( i.e. , the measurement with @xmath75 , although the backaction on the conjugate variable is of course finite ) is forbidden for a certain set of observables such as the number of gauge quanta .",
    "namely , one can not get information on @xmath2 without disturbing @xmath2 itself . if one wishes to make this backaction on @xmath2 small , then the response range of the apparatus and the information entropy obtained by the measurement",
    "are limited , as demonstrated in the previous section .",
    "it should be pointed out that this limitation of measurement leads to many other limitations .",
    "for example , it imposes a limit on the controllability of quantum systems : one must perform a measurement to control a system , but an accurate measurement gives rise to large backactions on some of the measured quantities , and the control becomes imperfect .",
    "another example is the limitation of the preparation of quantum states . to prepare a system in a desired state",
    ", one must perform ideal measurements on some set of observables , e.g. , on a `` complete set of commuting observables '' @xcite .",
    "however , as i have shown in this paper , an ideal measurement is impossible for some observables .",
    "therefore , the problems of the preparation of quantum states should be reconsidered .    as seen from these examples",
    ", the limitation of the measurement means that _ accurate specification of quantum systems is impossible in general_. this seems to be related to the foundation of the statistical mechanics .",
    "for example , imperfect knowledge about the initial state of the system leads to rapid loss of knowledge as the time evolves .",
    "this results in the ergodic property and the mixing property @xcite , although quantum systems can not have these properties if the initial state is accurately known @xcite ."
