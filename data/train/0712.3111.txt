    "the exotic hydrogen  like atoms are formed in highly excited states , when negative particles ( @xmath2 ) are stopped in hydrogen .",
    "the deexcitation of exotic atoms proceeds via many intermediate states until the ground state is reached or a nuclear reaction takes place . despite a long history of theoretical and experimental studies the kinetics of this atomic cascade is not yet fully understood .",
    "the present experiments with the exotic hydrogen - like atoms addresses a number of fundamental problems using precision spectroscopy methods , the success of which relies crucially on a better knowledge of the atomic cascade .",
    "the experimental data are mainly appropriate to the processes at the last stage of the atomic cascade ( x - ray yields and the products of the weak or strong interaction of the exotic particle in the low angular momentum states with hydrogen isotopes )",
    ". so the reliable theoretical backgrounds on the processes both in low - lying and in highly excited states are required for the detailed and proper analysis of the experimental data .",
    "in this paper we present the _ ab initio _ quantum - mechanical treatment of non - reactive scattering processes of the excited exotic hydrogen atom in collisions with the hydrogenic atom in the ground state : @xmath3 elastic scattering(@xmath4 ) , stark transitions ( @xmath5 ) , and coulomb deexcitation ( cd ) ( @xmath6 ) . here",
    "@xmath7 are hydrogen isotopes and @xmath8 ; @xmath9 are the principal and orbital quantum numbers of exotic atom . while the deexcitation processes are obviously essential for the atomic cascade , the role of the collisional processes preserving the principal quantum number @xmath10 is also very important .",
    "the stark transitions affect the population of the @xmath11 sublevels and together with the elastic scattering they decelerate the exotic atoms thus influencing their energy distribution during the cascade .",
    "starting from the classical paper by leon and bethe  @xcite , stark transitions has been treated in the semiclassical straight - line - trajectory approximation ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fully quantum - mechanical treatment of the elastic scattering and stark transitions based on the adiabatic description was given for the first time in  @xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite , the processes have also been studied in a close - coupling approach with using dipole approximation for interaction potential and taking the electron screening effect into account by the model .",
    "the cross sections calculated in approaches  @xcite are in good agreement .",
    "concerning the cd process , the situation is much less defined , especially for low @xmath10 .",
    "the first work on the cd process was performed by bracci and fiorentini  @xcite in frame of the semiclassical approach with some additional approximations . in the following numerous papers ( see  @xcite and references therein ) the cd process is considered within the asymptotic approaches using the adiabatic hidden crossing theory .",
    "the cd calculations were also performed in the classical - trajectory monte - carlo ( ctmc ) approach@xcite .",
    "while the coulomb deexcitation cross sections obtained in ctmc approach are in fair agreement with the semiclassical ones of bracci and fiorentini  @xcite , the more elaborated advanced adiabatic approach ( aaa )  @xcite gives too small cd cross sections to explain the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the reasons of such a strong discrepancy are not clear .",
    "one can only assume that the semiclassical model of bracci and fiorentini as well as the ctmc approach are not valid for low - lying states and at low energies .",
    "the processes ( 1 ) have been treated recently by authors in a unified manner in the framework of the close - coupling ( cc ) approach ( see for detail  @xcite ) .",
    "the differential and integral cross sections for the processes ( 1 ) have been calculated for muonic , pionic and antiprotonic hydrogen atoms in excited states with @xmath12 and in a kinetic energy range relevant for cascade calculations .",
    "the energy shifts of the @xmath0 states due to vacuum polarization and strong interaction ( for hadronic atoms ) are included in the close - coupling method .",
    "this approach allows to obtain the self - consistent description of all the processes ( 1 ) and is free from the additional approximations used in previous studies . the calculated differential and integral cross sections presented in this paper mainly refer to the cd process to illustrate some of our new results obtained quite recently .",
    "all open channels corresponding to the exotic atom states with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is principal quantum number in the entrance channel ) have been included in the cc calculations .",
    "the effect of the closed channels with @xmath15 was also studied and will be discussed below .",
    "( throughout the whole paper the cross sections are given in atomic units . )",
    "the hamiltonian of the system @xmath16 ( after separation of the c.m .",
    "motion ) is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath19 is the radius vector between the c.m . of the colliding atoms ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are their inner coordinates .",
    "the interaction potential , @xmath22 , is a sum of four coulomb pair interactions between the projectile atom and the target atom particles . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the hydrogen - like hamiltonians of the free exotic and hydrogen atom , whose eigenfunctions together with the angular wave function @xmath25 of the relative motion form the basis states , @xmath26 , with the conserving total angular momentum ( @xmath27 ) and parity @xmath28 . in the present consideration",
    "we use the `` frozen '' electron approximation .",
    "the cc approach can be extended in a straightforward manner to include the target electron excitations .",
    "the total wave function of the system are expanded in terms of the basis states as follows @xmath29    the expansion ( 3 ) leads to the close - coupling second order differential equations for the radial functions of the relative motion , @xmath30 , @xmath31 the channel wave number is defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and ( @xmath34 ) are the energy of the relative motion and the exotic atom quantum numbers in the entrance channel , respectively .",

    "all open channels corresponding to the exotic atom states with @xmath13 have been included in the close - coupling calculations . the effect of closed channels with @xmath15 was also investigated and will be discussed below . in the next sections we present and discuss the following total cross sections of the scattering processes : the partial cross section @xmath48 @xmath49 the total cross section of the @xmath50 transition @xmath51 , and the @xmath52-averaged cross section @xmath53 , and also the analogous differential cross sections .",
    "the total cross sections calculated in adiabatic  @xcite and present cc approaches are as a whole in good agreement at energies @xmath54  ev . the angular distributions obtained in the present cc and adiabatic  @xcite calculations coincide in the region of the diffraction maximums but demonstrate significant differences in backward hemisphere ( see the left side of fig.1 ) .",

    "it is well known  @xcite that cross sections of these processes are similar to the diffraction scattering ( at energies more @xmath60  ev ) with a strong forward peak enhancing with increasing energy and a set of maxima and minima .",
    "while the elastic cross sections always have a strong peak at @xmath61 , the first maximum position in the stark cross section depends on the @xmath62 value .",
    "in particular , for @xmath63 this maximum is at finite scattering angles as it is also remarked in  @xcite .",

    "it is seen from fig.3 that @xmath0-state energy shift due to strong interaction leads to essential suppression of both stark @xmath67 and elastic @xmath68 transitions ( we used the value @xmath69  ev for the @xmath41-state shift and @xmath70 for @xmath0-states ) at energies compared with the shift value .",
    "the same effect is observed for all hadronic atoms .",
    "the nature of the cd process is quite different from the one of the elastic or stark processes .",
    "in contrast to elastic ( stark ) scattering cd process is accompanied by the large energy release ( tens and hundreds ev ) and occur at smaller distances , so the details of the short - range interaction are more important for the treatment of cd process than for elastic processes .",
    "this difference between elastic and deeply inelastic processes is illustrated by fig .",
    "4 where the @xmath43 dependence of the partial - wave l - averaged cross sections @xmath71 for @xmath72 at three fixed energies 0.1 , 2 , and 50 ev is shown .",
    "it is seen that a substantial part of the cd cross section ( @xmath73 ) comes from the partial waves with rather a low @xmath43 in contrast to the elastic ( stark ) process .    in spite of the value of the total cd cross section",
    "constitutes about few per cent of the total elastic cross section it is incorrect to treat cd in the framework of the perturbation theory . in each",
    "significant for cd partial wave the value of the cd cross section is comparable with the elastic cross section .",
    "the cd process is determined by the short - range behaviour of the wave function which changes when new channels are included in calculation . therefore , to calculate the transition @xmath74 in a proper way it is impossible to be restricted with the two - level approximation ( @xmath10 and @xmath75 ) and",
    "the states with other nearest @xmath10 should be involved .",
    "we studied the dependence of the results on the number of included channels and found that the inclusion of the channels with @xmath76 leads to a strong suppression of the main @xmath74 transitions in comparison with the two - level cc approximation and due to this the total cd cross section is also suppressed  @xcite .",
    "so in all our cd calculations we included all the open channel with @xmath13 . it should be noted that all the previous calculations of cd realized within semiclassical or adiabatic approaches used a two - level approximation .",
    "it is obvious that two - level approximation is not absolutely suitable for the treatment of transitions with @xmath77 .",
    "in contrast to the elastic scattering and stark transitions where the `` dipole '' approximation ( @xmath78 ) and even more rough dipole potential ( used in  @xcite ) gives reasonable results ( at not too low energies ) , in case of the deeply inelastic process such as cd the full interaction must be used as it is clear from the present study .",
    "it is commonly believed  @xcite that the cd cross sections at low energies behave like @xmath79 . in order to reveal more explicitly the distinction from the @xmath79",
    "behaviour the present @xmath52-averaged cd cross sections multiplied by energy are shown in fig.5 in comparison with the results of the sc model  @xcite for @xmath80 and ctmc calculations  @xcite for @xmath81 .    as it is seen , the energy dependence of the cc cross sections in the region @xmath82 ev , as a whole , is in a qualitative agreement with the results  @xcite and @xcite . at lower energies",
    "the present cc results reveal @xmath83 dependence in accordance with the wigner threshold law ( the similar behaviour is seen in the ctmc results  @xcite for @xmath81 ) and in disagreement with @xmath79 dependence obtained in the sc model  @xcite and aa approach  @xcite .",
    "the distribution over the final states @xmath84 is strongly different from the sc results  @xcite as illustrated in fig .",
    "the cc calculations predict that the transitions with @xmath85 are strongly enhanced as compared with the results of the two - level approaches @xcite .",
    "the @xmath85 transitions make up a substantial fraction ( 16% - 37% ) of the total cd cross section for @xmath86 .",
    "the angular distributions of cd was calculated for the first time in  @xcite .",
    "earlier in the cascade calculations the angular distributions of the cd process are presumed to be isotropic .",
    "the calculated cross sections for individual @xmath87 transitions with @xmath88 and 2 at energy @xmath89  ev are shown in fig .",
    "7 . in fig .  8",
    "the @xmath52-averaged cross sections for the @xmath90 transition at different values of the relative energy from 0.01 up to 15  ev are presented .",

    "the cross sections for @xmath95 transitions ( see fig .",
    "7 ) have ( as for elastic scattering ) a more pronounced diffraction structure with sharp maxima and minima and a strong peak at zero angle as compared with the smoother angular dependence for other cd transitions .",
    "the increase of kinetic energy enhances asymmetry in the angular dependence of the @xmath52-averaged cross sections and decreases the role of the backward scattering ( see fig .",
    "in order to illustrate the influence of the @xmath0 state energy shifts on the cd cross sections , we calculated the cd cross sections for @xmath96 collisions both with and without taking energy shifts into account .",
    "the effect is the most pronounced for the low - lying states and is illustrated in fig .",
    "one can see that the maximal suppression due to the energy shift of @xmath97 state is about two times at very low energy both for @xmath98 and @xmath99 transitions , while at @xmath100 ev does not exceed 15% ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "the energy dependence of the cd cross sections for the collisions of the @xmath101 atom ( @xmath65 ) with the hydrogen atom obtained in the cc approach is shown in fig .  10 for @xmath65 and the different values of @xmath102 = 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the special features of these cross sections are the following : the similar energy dependence but sharper than that of the elastic scattering and stark transitions ( see also in fig .",
    "10 ) ; the contribution of the transitions with @xmath103 is comparable with the one for @xmath102 = 1 and is equal about 50% .",
    "the effect of the @xmath0 state shifts in the @xmath52-averaged cd cross sections is negligible due to small statistical weight of the @xmath0-state . in fig .",
    "10 we also compare our results with those obtained in the semiclassical model for the @xmath104 transition .",
    "the satisfactory agreement is observed , but this agreement is quite occasional and takes no place for other @xmath10 values .",
    "the distribution over the final states @xmath84 is completely different from the sc results  @xcite as it was illustrated in fig .",
    "the presented above results were obtained by the solution of the close - coupling equations including all the open channels .",
    "although the channels with @xmath15 for @xmath105 and at energies less or @xmath106 ev are strongly closed , they can essentially change the open - channel wave functions at short ranges determining cd process .    in the present studies we included in the calculations all the open channels with @xmath107 and step by step added closed channels with @xmath108 to achieve the convergency of results . in fig .",
    "11 some of our preliminary results are shown for the @xmath52-averaged cd cross sections at @xmath109  ev . according to our investigation , the closed channel effect on cd cross sections",
    "depends crucially on the transition considered . as it is seen from fig .  11 in case of @xmath110 atom the inclusion in the basis set of the closed channels results in a more pronounced effect for low - lying states .",
    "the investigations of convergency with the increase of number of closed channels are very time - consuming and are continuing now .",
    "the unified treatment of the elastic scattering , stark transitions and coulomb deexcitation is presented within the quantum - mechanical close - coupling approach .",
    "the differential and integral cross sections for the above processes are calculated for the excited muonic , pionic and antiprotonic hydrogen atoms with @xmath12 and relative energies relevant to the cascade calculations .",
    "the new results for cd process are obtained : anisotropy of the angular distribution , substantial fraction of @xmath103 transitions up to @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 at all energies under consideration ) , and a proper threshold behaviour of the cd cross - section .",
    "the calculated cross - sections are very important for the kinetics of the atomic cascade and give a more reliable theoretical input for the improved version of the cascade model  @xcite .",
