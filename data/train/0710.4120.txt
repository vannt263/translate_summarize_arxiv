    "the quest to realize quantum information processing ( qip ) has motivated an impressive race to implement high precision preparation and manipulation of isolated two - level quantum systems ( qubits ) in a wide variety of physical settings @xcite .",
    "a hallmark achievement for each such approach is the generation of quantum entanglement through controlled interaction between two or more qubits .",
    "since switchable direct interactions between qubits often entail additional decoherence mechanisms , many qip proposals rely on interactions _ mediated _ by an additional quantum system . as a rule",
    "this mediator ( just as the qubits themselves ) needs to be prepared in a pure state to achieve high - fidelity quantum operations and it may look futile to use a high - entropy mesoscopic spin bath for this task .",
    "in contrast to these expectations , we show here that high - fidelity entanglement generation can be realized even if the qubits can only interact with an arbitrarily mixed spin bath , provided that this interaction can be switched on and off , single - qubit unitaries are available , and the bath has slow internal dynamics .",
    "this is motivated by and will be illustrated through the example of electron - spin qubits in quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite , where the ensemble of lattice nuclear spins represents a strongly coupled but slowly evolving spin bath .",
    "nuclear spins in quantum dots have received much theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite attention in the qip context as the main source of electron - spin decoherence through the strong hyperfine coupling .",
    "it has also been noted that their slow internal dynamics and long ( expected ) decoherence time @xcite make the ensemble of nuclear spins useful as a quantum memory @xcite or for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "these applications , however , require careful and yet unachieved preparation of the nuclear system .",
    "what we show here is , that the unprepared , highly or even maximally mixed ( nuclear ) system is able to mediate coherent interaction between electrons and thereby allows the generation of highly entangled states of many ( electron spin ) qubits without any electron - electron interaction .",
    "we consider a qd in the single - electron regime @xcite and assume the availability of single - electron state preparation and measurement as well as the controlled shuttling of prepared electrons into and out of the qd , all of which have been demonstrated experimentally @xcite",
    ". additionally required is control of the detuning ( e.g. , by a magnetic or electric field ) , which switches the hyperfine ( hf ) interaction between resonant and off - resonant regimes .",
    "we first show how sequential interaction of three electrons with the nuclear bath can generate a maximally entangled pair of electron spins .",
    "more generally , the class of states that can be generated via the spin bath is characterized in terms of matrix product states .",
    "finally we show that imperfect electron spin operations , inhomogeneous couplings between electron and nuclei and modifications to the ideal static spin bath still allow for the scheme to be realized . in situations where spin - orbit coupling is large , our scheme can be an interesting alternative to the standard exchange based setups , because it does not involve occupation of any higher orbital levels  @xcite .",
    "we consider each electron coupled via the uniform heisenberg interaction to the bath of @xmath0 nuclear spins and to an external magnetic field @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 @xmath4 is the spin operator for the electron and @xmath5 are the three components of the collective nuclear spin operators ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 = -i^+ , \\,\\ , [ i^+,i^- ] = 2 i^z$ ] ) .",
    "@xmath8 is the electron @xmath9-factor and @xmath10 the bohr magneton .",
    "we consider spin-1/2 nuclei , neglect bath dynamics , the bath spins zeeman energies , and inhomogeneities in the heisenberg couplings for now , and discuss the validity of these approximations towards the end of this article .",
    "we use the dicke basis @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the eigenvalue of the collective angular momentum operator @xmath13 , the eigenvalue of @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the permutation quantum number @xcite .",

    "the @xmath15-dependent relative phase in the above equation restricts to generation of ghz - states with even particle number .",
    "when multiple resonant interactions with the ancilla and varying interaction times are allowed , a larger class of states becomes accessible . to see which states",
    "can the in principle be prepared , we exploit the similarity of our setup to the sequential entanglement generation scheme analyzed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "there it was shown , that all the matrix product states ( mps ) of bond dimension @xmath59 can be prepared if a string of qubits interacts sequentially with a @xmath59-dimensional ancilla system and _ arbitrary unitaries _ can be performed on ancilla and qubit in every step .    to apply this result to the present case ,",
    "ancilla electron and nuclear spin system together represent the control qubit : an effective @xmath60 system with hilbert space spanned for given @xmath61 by @xmath62 . to see that arbitrary unitaries are possible , note that @xmath20-rotations of the control qubit are caused by resonant interaction , while a static @xmath1-field causes @xmath21-rotations . from these",
    ", all single qubit gates on the control qubit can be constructed .",
    "the off - resonant interaction considered before performs essentially a cnot gate between the passing and the control qubit . in the cnot gate",
    "the `` control qubit '' is the control and the passing electron the target , in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 basis , respectively .",
    "combined with single - qubit gates ( on the passing electron ) , this seems to be enough to allow for arbitrary transformations on the coupled control - target system .",
    "however , the situation is more complicated since the effective gate performed by the off - resonant interaction _ differs _ for even and odd parity of the control qubit , namely @xmath65 , i.e. , there is not only , as seen before , a parity - dependent phase but whether logical-0 or logical-1 controls the bit - flip in the passing qubit also depends on the parity of @xmath15 .",
    "one way to remove this @xmath15-dependence and enable the generation of arbitrary states is to perform an `` @xmath14 parity measurement '' by sending an electron @xmath46 into the dot , and then measure it in the @xmath64 basis after off - resonant interaction for a time @xmath66 .",
    "depending on the outcome , either the odd or the even states are projected out .",
    "remarkably , gaining this single bit of information about the @xmath67-dimensional bath then allows us to remove all @xmath15-dependence and perform clean cnot - gates .",
    "hence the interactions outlined above are sufficient to prepare all @xmath60-mps with high fidelity and , if the passing electrons can be brought into interaction with the ancilla again at any time , _ arbitrary _ two - qubit gates can be performed , which implies that all matrix product states with two dimensional bonds can be sequentially created  @xcite .",
    "direct resonant interactions lead to very low fidelity @xmath20-rotations due to averaging over the different subspaces , indicating that prior measurement @xcite or cooling @xcite of the spin bath might be necessary .",
    "more sophisticated control schemes , however , allow for near unit fidelity single qubit rotations with no prior preparation : in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proven that high fidelity arbitrary single qubit gates can be effected by a hamiltonian @xmath68 , when only the parameter @xmath69 can be controlled precisely . for @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "it is sufficient to know that they are non - zero for some value of a controllable external parameter and zero for another .",
    "in our situation we have the three hamiltonians @xmath72 ( nuclear zeeman ) , @xmath73 $ ] ( resonant hf ) , and @xmath74 \\sigma_z$ ] ( off - resonant hf ) at hand .",
    "the pauli matrices are acting on the control qubit , @xmath75 is the nuclear magnetic moment and @xmath76 .",
    "the plus and minus signs for @xmath77 can be effected through spin flips of the passing electron ( recall that @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "these hamiltonians can be switched on and off ( adiabatically ) at will .",
    "appropriate iterations of evolutions can lead to effective hamiltonians of weighted sums and commutators of @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , the subspace independence of the parameter @xmath81 allows for generation of any weighted sum of @xmath82 and @xmath83 with the weights being @xmath61-independent , thus making the results of ref .  @xcite applicable .",
    "we have thus shown that while naive use of resonant interactions will lead to poor gate fidelities for the control qubit , enhanced control schemes still allow for full access to high fidelity rotations .",
    "hence , in principle , universal quantum computation on an electron - spin quantum register can be performed , with all interactions mediated by the highly mixed spin bath .",
    "we discuss now various couplings that have been neglected in the idealized hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) but are present in the qd setup .",
    "we are concerned here only with their effects on the basic entanglement generation scheme .",
    "it is clear that the scheme can only work as long as it is fast compared to the electron @xmath84 time , since the coherence of the ancilla electron must be preserved .",
    "we see below that neither nuclear dynamics nor inhomogeneity place more stringent conditions on our scheme .",
    "the hf hamiltonian in qds has a slightly different form from the one in eq .",

    ", one can completely cancel the undesired phase by removing the electrons from the qd and reversing the magnetic field for @xmath132 .",
    "the major internal dynamics of nuclear spins in qds stems from the indirect hyperfine mediated interaction , and the direct dipolar interaction @xcite .",

    "thus we need @xmath142 ; given @xmath143ms @xcite for nearest neighbors , and @xmath144 ps , this condition is readily fulfilled even for large dots .",

    " @xmath159 yields @xmath160 for the same situation as above .",
    "this overall error is thus on the order of a few percent for realistic situations .",
    "we implicitly assumed the possibility of storing the electrons protected from any bath . in qd structures",
    "this could be achieved by shuttling the electrons to a nuclear spin - free region or employing dynamical decoupling schemes , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the required storage times of a few tens of @xmath161s should be readily achieved .",
    "a finite probability that an up - electron is wrongly detected as a down electron ( or vice versa ) , degrades the final entanglement .",
    "however , as only one electron needs to be measured , the effect is no worse for the @xmath53-partite ghz - state than for the bell state @xmath162 .",
    "the same goes for variations in the resonant interaction time @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , errors in the electron preparation and variations in the off - resonant interaction time @xmath33 , since they affect each of the @xmath53 electrons lead to a fidelity reduction that scales exponentially with @xmath53 .",
    "variations in @xmath33 must be such that @xmath163 with @xmath164 , which makes this the most stringent , but still realistic  @xcite , requirement for electron timing .",
    "we have considered the heisenberg interaction of electron spin qubits with a long - lived spin bath in a situation where _ nothing _ is known about the state of the bath and shown that nevertheless high fidelity multipartite entanglement can be created via this bath .",
    "the qubits do neither interact directly with each other nor simultaneously with the bath at any time .",
    "our protocol thus demonstrates that even the interaction even with infinite temperature systems can mediate highly coherent operations and thus represent a valuable resource for quantum information processing that merits further inverstigation .",
    "in fact , when only one bit of information is extracted from the spin bath , arbitrary gates between the bath and the qubits are possible , and all matrix product states with 2d bonds can be created by sequential interaction .",
