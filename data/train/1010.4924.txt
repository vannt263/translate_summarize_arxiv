    "since there is a gap in the range 0.1 - 10 terahertz ( thz ) in the electromagnetic spectrum for practical coherent sources , development of a material as a useful source could lead to many practical applications in the detection of complex molecules , in national security detection issues , space communications , environmental engineering , biochemistry analysis , cancer detection , and possibly genetic engineering @xcite .",
    "recently , the discovery of intense , continuous , coherent sub - terahertz radiation upon the application of a static voltage @xmath10 across the @xmath11 intrinsic josephson junctions in mesas of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi-2212 ) has generated a lot of excitement , in the hope that such a material may lead to a useful source filling the `` terahertz gap '' @xcite .",
    "as in those papers , it was generally found that the fundamental angular frequency @xmath12 of the @xmath4 josephson current generated by the applied @xmath13 voltage @xmath10 satisfies the @xmath4 josephson relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the magnitude of the electronic charge , @xmath16 is planck s constant divided by @xmath17 , and the fundamental josephson frequency @xmath18 .",
    "an additional constraint on the radiation occurs when @xmath10 is adjusted in the mesa s current - voltage ( @xmath19 ) characteristic such that the frequency matches that of an electromagnetic cavity mode of the rectangular mesa .",
    "we assume the rectangular mesa has width @xmath2 , length @xmath20 , and height @xmath21 .",
    "writing @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the wave vectors and position vectors outside the mesa , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the corresponding vectors inside the mesa , the angular frequencies @xmath26 of the very thin rectangular cavity tm@xmath27 modes are @xmath28^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath30 is the index of refraction of bi-2212 in the frequency range of study@xcite .",
    "hence , this additional constraint may be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are particular values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . from fits to many rectangular mesas @xcite , it is evident that in all studies to date , the frequency @xmath36 of the tm@xmath37 mode with @xmath38 matches the fundamental frequency @xmath39 of the radiation .",
    "therefore , most workers assumed that the fundamental mode was described by a standing wave of wavelength @xmath40 across the width of the mesa @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies were made based upon the coupling of the ac josephson current to this particular half - wavelength electromagnetic cavity mode @xcite .",
    "however , with one exception @xcite , these calculations were unable to predict any angular dependence of the output radiation from the cavity . in the sole exception @xcite",
    ", the mesa was modeled as a two - dimensional sheet in either the @xmath41 plane or the @xmath9 plane , and the output power was calculated numerically . in that numerical calculation , it was therefore difficult to obtain the full three - dimensional angular dependence of the output power for comparison with experiment .",
    "thus , several workers employed the magnetic love equivalence principle @xcite , a variation on huygens principle , to replace the electric field in the cavity by a magnetic surface current density , and then to use that effective magnetic surface current density to obtain the three - dimensional far - field radiation distribution@xcite .",
    "however , in fits to experiment on rectangular mesas , it was found that in addition to the radiation from the excitation of the electromagnetic cavity mode corresponding to the half - wavelength mode by the non - uniform part of the ac josephson current , the uniform part of the ac josephson current was also found to radiate@xcite .",
    "this radiation was treated by the electric love equivalence principle @xcite , in which the ac josephson current inside the mesa was effectively replaced by an electric surface current density@xcite . in fits to the observed output radiation from a rectangular mesa , it was then found that the observed radiation was consistent with a comparable amount from both the uniform ac josephson current source and the electromagnetic cavity mode excited by the non - uniform part of the ac josephson current in the mesa@xcite .",
    "direct evidence for the importance of the uniform ac josephson current source was subsequently provided by the investigation of cylindrical mesas@xcite . in that experiment ,",
    "three disk - shaped cylindrical cavities were found to exhibit radiation not only at the fundamental electromagnetic cavity mode for a cylindrical cavity , but also at the integral second harmonic of the fundamental radiation frequency @xcite . since the modes for a cylindrical cavity are not integral multiples of one another@xcite , it was therefore determined that the observed output radiation was a combination of that arising from the excitation of the fundamental cylindrical cavity mode excited by the main non - uniform part of the ac josephson current and the radiation from the uniform part of the ac josephson current itself @xcite",
    ". the integrated intensities of the outputs from those two sources were found to be comparable to one another@xcite .",
    "hence , the dual - source mechanism of radiation from both the uniform part of the ac josephson current and from the excitation of a cavity mode from the appropriate part of the non - uniform ac josephson current was established@xcite .",
    "however , the observation of `` hot spots '' in rectangular bi-2212 mesas accompanied by the apparent evidence of standing waves with @xmath42 along the length of the mesa have led to a lot of interest @xcite . very recently , wang _ et al .",
    "_ provided evidence that the samples exhibiting such hot spots do in fact emit radiation @xcite .",
    "although there is widespread agreement that the fundamental mode in all rectangular mesas studied to date has the frequency of the tm@xmath43 mode , it has therefore been an open question as to whether the waves contributing to the radiation form across the width of the mesa , as expected from standard cavity theory @xcite , or form with the same wavelength @xmath40 along the length of the mesa . in this paper",
    ", we address that issue in detail , performing detailed fits to the data of kadowaki _ et al .",
    "_ for the angular dependence of the radiation in the @xmath9 and @xmath44 planes normal and parallel to the mesa length , respectively @xcite , and find that both cavity wave directions make equally probable contributions to the radiation for that mesa with a mean @xmath5 .",
    "however , we show that in the special cases in which @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a natural number and @xmath7 is the index of the tm@xmath8 mode , an excited cavity wave formed along the length of the mesa can not emit radiation in the @xmath9 plane normal to the mesa length , and we thus propose detailed angular dependence studies of the radiation from such mesas as a more precise test of this question .    in sec",
    ". ii , we present the angular dependence of the radiation from a rectangular mesa with the radiation arising from two sources : the uniform @xmath4 josephson current source , and the radiation from an excited electromagnetic cavity mode , in which either standing or traveling waves may form either across the width or along the length of the mesa . in sec .",

    "however , as it has been established that the radiation from existing mesas of bi-2212 arises from a dual - source mechanism , with the primary radiation source being the uniform @xmath4 josephson current @xcite , and further supported by the four fits to the existing data shown in figs . 1 and 2 , it is important to remember that the predicted electromagnetic cavity radiation displayed in figs .",
    "3 - 6 for rectangular mesas with @xmath217 is only part of the predicted radiation .",
    "in addition , there will be the radiation from the uniform @xmath4 josephson current source with the same frequency . in fig .",

    "this pattern is exactly the same as that for the frequency locked onto the tm@xmath161 mode , as those frequencies are identical .",
    "moreover , the patterns for the slightly different frequencies locked onto the tm@xmath162 and tm@xmath163 modes are almost indistinguishable from that shown in fig .",
    "9(a ) , and hence are not shown . thus , although the radiation patterns from the excitation of tm@xmath220 electromagnetic cavity modes with @xmath221 are extremely different , the patterns predicted to arise from the primary radiation source , the uniform @xmath4 josephson current , are nearly identical .",
    "we note that for both sources , the radiation at @xmath154 vanishes , unlike the case of the electromagnetic cavity radiation for the rectangular mesa with mean @xmath131 , the fits to which are displayed in figs . 1 and 2 .",

    "the lack of azimuthal anisotropy was also present for the combined radiation of the cavity tm@xmath43 and tm@xmath207 modes with @xmath223 pictured in fig .",
    "7(a ) , but in that case , the radiation was a maximum at @xmath154 , and in this case , it vanishes at @xmath154 .",
    "both cases thus are essentially the same as for the corresponding cases for the uniform @xmath4 josephson radiation locked onto the cylindrical cavity tm@xmath164 mode @xcite . for the frequency locked onto that of the rectangular tm@xmath164 mode ,",
    "the radiation emitted from the uniform @xmath4 josephson current source is nearly identical to that pictured in fig .",
    "9(b ) , so it is not shown for brevity .",
    "in addition , the radiation from the @xmath4 josephson current source the frequency of which is locked onto either that of the cavity tm@xmath160 mode or the cavity tm@xmath163 mode is also independent of azimuthal angle @xmath141 , so those figures are also not shown for brevity . at those frequencies ,",
    "both radiation sources lead to a vanishing output at @xmath154 , but each cavity source radiation is highly @xmath141-dependent , unlike the uniform @xmath4 josephson current source radiation . as for the other rectangular mesas studied , if the square mesa were placed atop a superconducting substrate , both radiation sources would lead to a vanishing output at @xmath222 .",
    "since the publication of the wang _ et al .",
    "_ paper @xcite , there has been an ongoing debate as to whether the radiation emitted from rectangular mesas originates partly from the standing wave across the width of the mesa or partly from excited waves of the same wavelength @xmath40 that appear to form along the length of the rectangular mesa . since experiments on a large number of rectangular mesas",
    "have determined that the wavelength of the radiation @xmath40 @xcite , it is natural to suppose that the cavity mode to which the @xmath4 josephson current couples is the tm@xmath43 mode .",
    "however , laser measurements have suggested that the standing waves forming along the length of the mesa appear to have the same wavelength @xmath42 . since the mesas in which these standing waves have been detected",
    "have since been shown to emit radiation , it is important for our understanding of the radiation mechanism to determine which , if either , of these possibilities is correct .",
    "we therefore re - examined the published angular dependence of the radiation emitted from a rectangular mesa @xcite .",
    "although one might suppose that it would be easy to distinguish these models from the calculated output radiation , for the dual - source mechanism with an arbitrary mix of radiation from the uniform @xmath4 josephson current source and the radiation from the excited electromagnetic cavity source , we found that both scenarios are equally probable : it is impossible from the existing data to distinguish whether the cavity source forms with the wave across the width or along the length of the rectangular mesa .",
    "this conclusion is based upon two models of the coherent cavity and @xmath4 josephson radiation sources contributing incoherently to the output , as required for any reasonable fit to experiment , since the data for positive and negative @xmath139 values were nearly symmetric both in the @xmath9 and @xmath44 planes @xcite .",
    "the equally probable overall best fits to the data of kadowaki _ et al .",
    "_ from a mesa with mean @xmath131 are for the standing wave forming across the mesa width in model i and for the traveling wave forming along the sample length in model ii .",
    "the first case is consistent with the analysis of kadowaki _",
    "et al._@xcite , preserving the von neumann boundary conditions . in the second case ,",
    "the traveling wave is free to move along the length of the sample with no preferred nodal position .",
    "in addition , there is a physical difference in the relative importance of the cavity portion of the overall output radiation of the two radiation sources .",
    "if the excited cavity waves were to form across the sample width , about half of the total radiation would arise from each source .",
    "but if the excited cavity waves were to form along the sample length , about two - thirds of the radiation would arise from the @xmath4 josephson current source .",
    "we remark that there are many ways to do the symmetric averaging of the cavity mode radiation in the presence of the radiation from the uniform @xmath4 josephson current source . in this work , we only used models i and ii . for model i with the wave along the length",
    ", we assumed the wave was centered either symmetrically , for @xmath93 slightly larger than an even integer , or asymmetrically , for @xmath93 slightly larger than an odd integer , as for the sample under study .",
    "then , we assumed @xmath224 $ ] for @xmath7 odd and @xmath225 $ ] for @xmath7 even .",
    "this results in a contribution to the output from the two - source mechanism that is symmetric about @xmath154 , as in experiment @xcite .",
    "it also preserves the von neumann boundary condition .",
    "we note , however , that this model i fit for a standing wave along the length led to the worst fit of the four models , but the model ii fit for a traveling wave along the length led to a tie for the best overall fit to the data .",
    "hence , some other averaging of @xmath226 that preserves the even @xmath139 symmetry of the combined output of the two - source mechanism could lead to an improved overall best fit .",
    "for example , one could in principle treat the combined equal outputs from @xmath226 and @xmath227 , as in the experiment , treating @xmath226 as a fitting parameter in addition to @xmath228 and @xmath229 , and perform a three - parameter fit to the data .",
    "such a three - parameter fit would likely lead to a lower standard deviation than that for the model ii fit , in which @xmath226 was averaged over all allowed values .",
    "this optimum fixed value of @xmath226 would lead to a standing wave along the mesa length .",
    "however , only about 1/3 of the combined output arose from the excited cavity mode in the models i and ii fits .",
    "hence , modifying the fit with a third adjustable parameter that improves the minor output fraction without making some comparable adjustment to the major ( uniform @xmath4 josephson current source ) output fraction could be unreliable .",
    "a more reliable three - parameter fit might therefore arise from the inclusion of a non - uniform correction to the @xmath4 josephson current source @xcite .",
    "hence the question as to whether the optimum fit for a wave along the rectangle length would be standing or traveling is unresolved .",
    "we then considered the possibility of investigating mesas with different @xmath93 ratios .",
    "we found that for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is any integer and @xmath7 is the index of the tm@xmath8 rectangular cavity mode , the electromagnetic cavity radiation from a standing wave along the length of the mesa ( in the degenerate tm@xmath230 mode ) vanishes in the @xmath9 plane . in those cases ,",
    "any observed radiation in the @xmath9 plane would have to arise from either the tm@xmath8 electromagnetic cavity mode or the uniform @xmath4 josephson radiation .",
    "in addition , for @xmath7 even , the radiation from the cavity tm@xmath8 mode with a wave across the width vanishes in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "we presented figures of the predicted radiation for a rectangular sample with @xmath206 and for a square sample , both suspended in vacuum , to illustrate these points . since for integral @xmath93",
    ", the radiation can occur from either or both of the two degenerate cavity modes , we pictured examples of the combined cavity radiation from both modes , which has reduced azimuthal anisotropy , especially when @xmath122 .",
    "we strongly encourage further experiments on samples with even - integral @xmath93 ratios to confirm these predictions .",
    "it would be very interesting to compare samples with even - integral @xmath93 values with those having slightly different @xmath93 values , to see if the radiation pattern is substantially different .",
    "the authors thank krsto ivanovic , reinhold kleiner , and masashi tachiki for helpful discussions .",
    "this work has been supported in part by crest - jst ( japan science and technology agency ) , wpi ( world premier international research center initiative)-mana ( materials nanoarchitectonics ) project ( nims ) and strategic initiative category ( a ) at the university of tsukuba .",
    "first , we list the results of our calculations for the radiation from a general cavity mode for an arbitrary @xmath93 ratio . for model",
    "i , we have @xmath231 for @xmath67 , where @xmath232 for model ii , @xmath233    then , we list the results for the radiation from the tm@xmath234 mode for a rectangle of length @xmath3 and width @xmath2 .",
