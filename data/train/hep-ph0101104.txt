    "strong interaction phenomena at low energies are very constrained by chiral symmetry and by the structure of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ground state , which involves the quark and the gluon condensates .",
    "massless qcd ( @xmath4 ) is symmetric under the group @xmath5 that is spontaneously broken to @xmath6 , what implies the existence of eight goldstone bosons coupled to the corresponding conserved axial quark currents .",
    "the coupling strength is related to the pseudo - scalar meson decay constant @xmath7 , which in the chiral limit is of order @xmath8  mev , much smaller than typical hadron masses , say @xmath9  gev .",
    "one may ask what is the size of the quark condensate parameter @xmath10 lattice calculations allow one to access this information , which is needed , for instance , in the applications of qcd sum rules . another phenomenological approach that refers to this quantity is chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite the only theory for low energy qcd .",
    "chpt lagrangian for meson processes is a series of terms of different orders in the covariant derivatives of goldstone fields and their masses .",
    "however , the order in the external momenta @xmath11 of the contribution of each term of the lagrangian to a given process depends on how big @xmath0 is , as will be explained in the sequence . in the standard chpt",
    ", @xmath0is assumed to be as large as @xmath12  gev . on the other hand , by considering the possibility of a low value for the quark condensate , some authors @xcite have developed a program named generalized chiral perturbation theory ( gchpt ) .",
    "as a new feature , the series of terms in the lagrangian keeps @xmath0 as an expansion parameter of @xmath13 , as well as the quark masses , which are in turn accounted for as @xmath14 in the standard case .",
    "our motivation in the present exercise is that , as it is well known , the values for the pion - pion s - wave scattering length within the two approaches differ by 30% , being the one form the generalized approach closer to the experimental value than in the standard case . here",
    "we try to look at another phenomenological consequence of these different frameworks .",
    "the standard and generalized scenarios can be analyzed by a global fit of pion - pion phase - shifts . in this case , in order to access the resonance region of pion - pion scattering using chpt , one may wish to use pad approximants , as e.g. advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , giving rise to the so called inverse amplitude method ( iam ) .    in the next section we present the chpt pion - pion scattering amplitude and the corresponding partial - waves . in section [ sec : fit ] iam is described and the fits to experimental data are shown .",
    "the last section includes our conclusion and final remarks .",
    "in the standard chpt @xcite the leading contribution to low energy pion - pion scattering reproduces the soft - pion amplitude obtained by weinberg @xcite , given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the leading order value of the pion mass in the standard chpt is denoted by @xmath17 , with @xmath18    on the other hand , in gchpt one gets the same structure as ( [ alea ] ) , with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath19 so that ( [ alea ] ) reads @xmath20 the new low energy constant ( lec ) introduced here is @xmath21 , which is the coefficient of @xmath22 ^ 2 $ ] in the term of order @xmath23 of the gchpt lagrangian , whereas in the standard case this term would be actually accounted for as @xmath24 .",
    "the expression ( [ aleas ] ) also depends on the ratio @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the strange quark mass .",
    "these differences between the two approaches are more important when including loop corrections to the total amplitude . in this case , some terms that are considered to be of orders @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the standard approach contribute to the one loop result .",
    "the general form of the amplitude up to one loop can be written as @xcite @xmath29 \\lambda_2 \\nonumber \\\\ % % % & + & \\frac 1 { 6 f_\\pi^4 }   \\left\\ { \\left [ 4 \\left [ \\beta \\left(s - \\frac 4 3 m_\\pi^2 \\right ) + \\frac 5 6 \\alpha   m_\\pi^2 \\right]^2 - \\left [ \\beta \\left(s - \\frac 4 3 m_\\pi^2 \\right ) - \\frac 2 3 \\alpha    m_\\pi^2 \\right]^2 \\right ] \\bar j ( s )   \\right .",

    "@xcite , obtained long ago by s borges in the context of the unitarization program of current algebra ( upca ) , if one takes @xmath32 and @xmath33 equal to one .",
    "let us mention that upca polynomials in energy are different from those in eq .",
    "( [ ag ] ) because their coefficients are collections of subtraction constants inherent to the dispersion relation technique , whereas in chpt they come from combinations of lecs and chiral logarithms .",
    "the isospin defined amplitudes @xmath34 for @xmath35 are @xmath36 which are expanded in partial - wave amplitudes , as @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the legendre polynomials . in the following",
    "we omit the label @xmath39 , because we just deal with s - wave ( @xmath40 ) and p - wave ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "elastic unitarity implies that , for @xmath42 , @xmath43 which can be solved yielding @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the real phase - shifts .",
    "our strategy is to disentangle between standard and generalized versions of chpt by fitting experimental phase - shifts . since chpt partial - wave amplitudes respect eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) only approximately they must be unitarized . in order to do this",
    "we follow the procedure of the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite , that amounts to writing @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are partial - wave projections of respectively @xmath49 and @xmath50 terms in eq .",
    "( [ ag ] ) .",
    "this expression allows one to access the resonance region for pion - pion scattering if one fixes the free parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 by fitting the phase - shifts defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) to experimental data .",
    "we recall that these parameters are collections of lecs . in chpt ,",
    "the lecs are not related to the explicit symmetry breaking parameter and have to be obtained phenomenologically .",
    "the traditional way to do that is to extract them from @xmath53 decay and from d - wave scattering length , for instance . here",
    "the lecs corresponding to the parameters obtained from our fits are not expected to be exactly the ones found in literature , but not very far from these , since the low energy behaviour of iam amplitudes are approximately the same as in the non - corrected ones .    in the general amplitude given by ( [ ag ] ) , besides the constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 , that will be used to fit the phase - shifts , we have also the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which can be written in terms of several lecs , such as @xmath0 and @xmath21 as well as other ones coming from higher orders and loop contributions . in the standard case , @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "are kept very close to one , while in gchpt they can change within a much wider range .",
    "the allowed values of these constants @xcite depend on the ratio @xmath54 and are very close to the corresponding ones of the standard chpt for large values of @xmath55 , namely greater than 25 . particularly , for a reasonable value , say @xmath56 , the allowed ranges are @xmath57 and @xmath58 approximately .",
    "regardless the value of @xmath55 , @xmath32 can vary from 1 to 4 and @xmath33 , up to 1.3 .    for each fixed choice of @xmath32 and @xmath33 within the ranges mentioned right above",
    ", we perform the fit of p - wave phase - shift , which determines the combination @xmath59 . this value",
    "is then introduced in the expression of @xmath60 s - wave in order to determine the remaining parameter by fitting experimental data .",
    "@xmath61 amplitude does not depend on any new parameter .",
    "for each set of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we could evaluate the quality of the fit , by considering the related @xmath62 .",
    "[ chi2 ] shows the @xmath62 of the fits for several choices of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "one can see that , for a given value of @xmath33 , the @xmath63 is not considerably modified within the range of @xmath32 values allowed according to ref .",
    "the quality of fits is very dependent on @xmath33 and the best fit corresponds to the bullet in the figure ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "according to this analysis , figs .",
    "[ pplot ] and [ splot ] present the resulting phase - shifts s - wave from ref .",
    "@xcite ( squares ) and ref . @xcite ( triangles ) and for @xmath61 s - wave from ref .",
    "] of respectively p- and s - waves , for only one choice of @xmath32 for each value of @xmath33 .",
    "the table presents the values of parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 for p1- and s0-wave fits and the value of the related @xmath63 s .",
    "clearly the fits get poorer for large values of @xmath33 .",
    "it means that , for @xmath68 the standard chpt approach is more suitable than gchpt to fit @xmath69 phase - shifts in a wide energy range .",
    "nevertheless if one accepts a large enough value for @xmath55 , then the two approaches are indistinguishable within this method .",
    "as a summary , we have presented a study motivated by discrepancies between the standard and generalized chpt predictions for s - wave pion - pion scattering length .",
    "our concern was to verify whether pion - pion phase - shifts could distinguish between the large and low value of the quark condensate . in order to achieve it ,",
    "we have fitted experimental data using the expressions following from the two scenarios .",
    "our work favors the standard approach of chpt , which assumes a large vacuum expectation value for the quark - antiquark condensate operator .",
