    "surface state properties relevant for the enhanced functionality are identified in these materials .",
    "first - principles band calculations are also presented for comparison with our experimental data .",
    "our experimental findings are itemized as follows .",
    "first , our data suggests that the ternary compound bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( se - rich ) has a large effective bulk band gap . by tuning the ratio of bismuth to antimony , we are able not only to lower the fermi level into the band gap but also to fine tune the fermi level so that it lies exactly at the dirac point .",

    "a singly degenerate gapless dirac cone centered at the @xmath30 point is observed in the representative compounds for each class , indicating that these materials belong to the @xmath31 = -1 topological class .",
    "the numerically predicted bulk band gap varies over an order of magnitude from 0.01 ev to 0.31 ev .",
    "such surface electron kinetics offer a wide range of topologically nontrivial electronic structures ranging from a nearly isotropic dirac cone ( e.g. pbbi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) to strongly anisotropic and doping dependent topological surface states .",
    "this remarkable material flexibility provides a wide range of critical electronic properties for realization of different functionalities , which are not even theoretically offered in the most commonly studied bi@xmath6 compounds .",
    "the presence of an isolated dirac node , as well as the tunability of the chemical potential to the isolated dirac point , is highly favored for application purposes because it reduces the scattering from the bulk bands .",
    "an important requirement for topological insulators in device oriented applications such as topological quantum information and low power spintronics devices @xcite is the dissipationless surface states in the topological transport regime , i.e. , an isolated dirac cone fully separated from bulk bands , and the fermi level located at the dirac point.@xcite the full exposure of topological transport regime for dissipationless spin current with tunable surface states is useful for the study of various novel topological phenomena , such as quantum spin hall effect , magnetoelectric effects , etc .",
    "@xcite however , none of the proposed applications have been realized due to the material drawbacks of the existing well - studied topological insulators .",
    "although there are various experimental efforts to realize an isolated dirac cone by tuning the fermi level with appropriate doping , @xcite the essential necessity of external surface deposition process makes this procedure unsuitable for most practical applications .",
    "recently , tuning of fermi level has been reported by changing the bi to sb composition ratio for sb@xmath2bi@xmath32 ( @xmath7 = se , te ) single crystals.@xcite it is well known that an isolated dirac node together with a chemical potential lying on the dirac point through sb substitution is not possible on either bi@xmath33te@xmath11 or bi@xmath33se@xmath11 . for sb@xmath2bi@xmath3te@xmath11 , though the chemical potential can be tuned by sb concentration,@xcite the dirac point is always buried inside the bulk valence bands . for sb@xmath2bi@xmath3se@xmath11 ,",

    "photon energy dependent measurements have been performed , as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) . while bulk valence bands change with photon energy , the surface bands and the isolated dirac node show no visible dispersion , suggesting the two - dimensional nature of the surface states .",

    "an important property for a functional electronic structure of a topological insulator is the isolation of the surface states from the bulk electronic states , since the surface signal would otherwise be washed out by the bulk contribution in transport experiments .",
