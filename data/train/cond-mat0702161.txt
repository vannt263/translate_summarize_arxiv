    "the recent observation of current suppression due to  pauli spin blockade \" in weakly coupled - double quantum dots ( dqds ) represents an important step towards the realization and manipulation of qubits @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the  pauli spin blockade \" arises from the occupation of a triplet state @xcite that is filled , but is not emptied easily .",
    "our model supports this picture and puts it in the context of what we believe is a much more generic model involving a  blocking \" @xcite or  dark \" state @xcite .",
    "a decrease in current with increasing voltage , often referred to as negative differential resistance ( ndr ) , has been observed in many electronic devices such as degenerately doped bulk semiconductors @xcite , quantum wells @xcite and even nano - structures @xcite , all of which can usually be understood within a one - electron picture .",
    "however , a number of recent experiments @xcite have reported ndr in nanoscale devices with large single - electron charging energies which may require a many - electron picture in fock space .",
    "although specific models such as coupling to vibronic states @xcite , spin selection rules @xcite asymmetric contact couplings @xcite , internal charge transfers @xcite , and possibly conformational changes have been put forth to explain some of these observations , we are not aware of any generic models comparable in clarity and generality to those available for the occurrence of ndr in the one - electron regime .    the objective of this paper is to present such a model for the strongly correlated transport regime , within the sequential tunneling approximation @xcite , where current collapse and ndr arise from the system being locked into a  blocking \" many electron state that can only be filled from one contact but can not be emptied by the other .",
    "once it is occupied , this state blocks any further current flow . this concept ( also invoked in a past work @xcite )",
    "can be used to understand a general category of experiments that involve ndrs . the basic idea behind current collapse is a condition under which an excited state of a coulomb blockaded channel , normally inaccessible at equilibrium can , under transport conditions , be occupied .",
    "a drop in the current at a higher bias occurs if this excited state is a  blocking \" state charecterized by a slow exit rate .",
    "in the first part of this paper we hence obtain a simple criterion for ndr in terms of the rates of filling and emptying of states .",
    "in the later part of this paper , we then apply our model to a specific example in detail , namely the ndr observed in weakly coupled - double quantum dots ( dqd s ) @xcite .",
    "our analysis , directly addresses current collapse in terms of current magnitudes , without invoking non - equilibrium population analysis @xcite .",
    "thus current magnitudes at various bias voltages can be solely expressed in terms of the dqd electronic structure parameters and electrode coupling strengths .",
    "it then becomes very transparent as to how the interdot orbital offset , hopping , onsite and long range correlations dramatically affect the observed ndr s , and leakage currents .",
    "in fact , all the non - trivial features in spin blockade i - v s @xcite such as multiple ndr s , bias asymmetry in current , gateable current collapse @xcite and finite leakage currents can all be explained using the basic ideas developed here .",
    "we believe that our criterion obtained from a simple model could be useful for a wide class of experiments beyond the dqd structure discussed in this paper .",
    "consider a generic coulomb blockaded system shown schematically in fig.1a that is coupled weakly to contacts defined by chemical potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "such a coulomb blockaded system is strongly interacting and is described by its states in fock space .",
    "a general condition for ndr to occur can be cast in terms of three fock space states @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 with energies @xmath5 respectively , shown in fig.1b , that represent three accessible states within the bias range of interest .",
    "typically , @xmath2 , @xmath3 could be the ground states of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 electron systems , while @xmath4 , the first excited state of the @xmath7 electron system .",
    "this description is equally valid for similar transitions between @xmath7 and @xmath8 electron states .",
    "transport of electrons involves single charge removal or addition between states @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 that differ by an electron , via addition and removal transition rates @xmath9 .",
    "such an electron exchange is initiated when reservoir levels are in resonance with single electron transport channels @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the i - v characteristics shown schematically in fig.1c , of this three state system shows two plateaus with current magnitudes @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "current collapse or ndr occurs when @xmath14 .",
    "let us now derive a condition for ndr to occur in the positive bias i - v characteristics , of this three state system .",
    "these plateau currents can be evaluated in terms of bias dependent probabilities of the three states @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , given by a set of coupled master equations @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the transition rate between state @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which could be an addition or a removal transition between these states that differ by a single electron .",
    "these rates are most generally described as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the coupling strength to either contacts , @xmath21 s denote coherence factors and @xmath22 denote fermi - dirac distributions in the leads . the coupling strengths are often expressed in terms of the tunneling hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents the @xmath25 eigen mode in @xmath26 either contact @xcite , and @xmath27 denotes a quantum dot state as : @xmath28 .",
    "note that for the downward transitions the @xmath29 s are replaced by @xmath30 s .",
    "the coherence factors depend significantly on the structure of the many - body states involved in the transition and will be considered while dealing with specific examples in the following sections .",
    "we also note that @xmath31 , since transitions between states with equal electron numbers are forbidden , in the absence of coupling to radiation fields @xcite , or higher order tunneling @xcite .",
    "the steady - state current @xmath32 equals both the left and right terminal currents ( @xmath33,@xmath34 ) given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electronic charge and @xmath37 , stands for the left or right contact contribution to the transition @xmath38 .",
    "positive bias plateau currents , shown schematically in fig.1c , ( see appendix i ) , are given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 when @xmath41 , current drops once the transition @xmath42 is accessed . using the above expressions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "this leads to a simple condition : @xmath43 for current collapse or ndr in the i - v characteristics to occur along the positive bias .",
    "a similar condition for negative bias ndr is obtained by replacing @xmath44 with @xmath45 and vice versa : @xmath46 the positive bias leakage current is now dictated by @xmath47 , which corresponds to the rate of leakage from the blocking channel @xmath4 . for @xmath48 , currents rise just like a regular coulomb blockade staircase due to access of a second transport channel .",
    "asymmetry of this blockade leads to current rectification observed in experiments @xcite , is dictated by the ratio : @xmath49 thus current collapse can occur along both bias directions , provided eqs .",
    "[ eq : ndr ] ,  [ eq : ndr2 ] are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "finally , asymmetric i - v s result when eq .",
    "[ eq : ndr3 ] is satisfied , as shown in fig .",
    "the condition for asymmetry to occur is just based on the ratio between positive and negative bias plateau currents , and generally depends on various couplings .",
    "thus , eq .  [ eq : ndr ] ,  [ eq : ndr2],and  [ eq : ndr3 ] , summarize the central concept of this paper .",
    "we will show in the next section that they provide a clear explanation for experimental observations reported for a weakly - coupled dqd system .",
    "it is worth noting that these conditions can be generalized even if the fock space states @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 have specific degeneracies @xcite provided the rate constants @xmath50 are modified by appropriate degeneracy factors . at this point",
    "it is also worth noting that the degeneracies considered here are such that individual processes that are involved in the transitions are uncorrelated .",
    "this justifies the use of rate equations ignoring off - diagonal effects .",
    "inclusion of off - diagonal terms , via a density matrix rate equation @xcite may be required to capture other subtle degeneracies @xcite not considered here .    before , we discuss coupled quantum - dots , it is useful to look into a simpler example discussed by various works @xcite and see how it maps onto our generic  blocking state \" model ( fig.1b ) . consider a single quantum dot with two non - degenerate levels , one up - spin and one down spin , as shown in fig.3a .",
    "the fock space picture in fig.3b looks just like fig .",
    "1b with @xmath2 being the state with no electron @xmath51 , @xmath3 being the state with one up electron @xmath52 , @xmath2 being the state with no electron @xmath51 , and @xmath4 being the state with one down - electron @xmath53 .",
    "note that the state with two electrons is assumed to have too high an energy to be accessed in the bias range of interest .",
    "it is easy to see that for positive bias that @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the contact couplings with up and down spin reservoir channels .",
    "ordinary contacts typically have @xmath59 , so that the ndr criteria ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : ndr ] ,  [ eq : ndr2 ] ) are never satisfied . however ,",
    "if one contact , say the right is spin polarized @xmath60 then ndr criteria is met for positive bias though not for negative bias .",
    "our idea of blocking states involves an inherent asymmetry within the transport problem . in our previous example ( fig.3 ) , this was achieved by explicitly postulating a spin polarized contact as the asymmetry mechanism .",
    "asymmetries leading to blocking states , can also arise from asymmetries within the system s internal degrees , thus requiring no apriori conditions on bare physical contact couplings .",
    "the asymmetry effects now enter the model through coherence factors mentioned earlier in eq .",
    "[ eq : rates ] .",
    "the rest of this paper focuses on how these coherence factors could lead to the ndr conditions eqs .",
    "[ eq : ndr ] ,  [ eq : ndr2 ] derived in the earlier section .",
    "we consider , a dqd system shown in fig.4a , with orbital energies @xmath61 , and specifically @xmath62 on each dot .",
    "we will now show that , for specific orbital offsets @xmath63 , its interplay with hybridization @xmath64 , and coulomb repulsion @xmath65 can result in a current collapse following the notion developed in the past section .",
    "the i - v characteristics discussed in this section , closely match the experimental features @xcite that indicate pauli spin blockade .      in this paper , we consider a double quantum dot as shown in fig.4a , that comprises of two dots whose lowest spin degenerate orbitals are labeled @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively . our analysis is limited to one orbital per quantum dot thus restricting our analysis to a few mev along either bias directions .",
    "higher orbitals on each quantum dot can in a similar way result in multiple ndr s @xcite along either bias directions .",
    "these higher orbital effects are accessed at a much higher bias than those considered here .",
    "we believe that the higher bias features are an extension of the general idea developed here , which will be addressed in a future work .",
    "let us now define the dqd hamiltonian @xcite in a localized orbital basis as : @xmath68 where the left and right dot single particle states are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 respectively , @xmath73 , @xmath74 denoting the opposite spin state .",
    "@xmath75 denotes the hopping term between the two dots , and @xmath76 , and @xmath65 denote the on - site and long - range coulomb repulsion term respectively .",
    "the many - electron spectrum shown in fig.4b comprises of @xmath77 states labeled as @xmath78 defined by the number of electrons @xmath7 and the excitation number @xmath79 .",
    "six states that are relevant to our spin blockade discussion are labeled within the boxed sections in fig.4b , and form a subset of the @xmath80 and @xmath81 blocks .",
    "the six states consist of a doubly degenerate bonding @xmath82 state in the @xmath80 subspace : @xmath83 a singlet @xmath84 state in the @xmath81 subspace : @xmath85 and a three - fold degenerate triplet @xmath86 states also in the @xmath81 subspace given by : @xmath87 here @xmath88 , and @xmath89 represent the wavefunction coefficients for the various basis fock - states .",
    "we shall see in the following subsection that these wavefunction coefficients depend on the physical parameter set @xmath90 of the dqd , and hence appear in the calculation of various coherence factors ( eq .  [ eq : rates ] ) involved in the transition rates .",
    "it is worth noting that the anti - bonding level @xmath91 of the @xmath80 spectrum is not involved in the pauli - blockade ndr .",
    "this is because in the weakly coupled dqd that we consider here , the bonding - antibonding gap is directly proportional to the orbital energy offset @xmath92 , which is of the order of a few milli - volts . the energy scale relevant to our ndr discussion is the singlet - triplet splitting which is of a couple of orders of magnitude smaller given that the dqd system is weakly coupled .",
    "the anti - bonding state then becomes relevant beyond the bias range considered here where the spin - blockade is lifted .",
    "_ coherence factors : _ although six states , ( fig.4b ) are involved in the spin blockade i - v characteristics within the bias range of interest , they can be cast in the familiar tri - state form ( fig.1b ) as shown in fig.5 , by incorporating the appropriate degeneracy factors @xcite for the transition rates .",
    "the degenerate states may just be lumped as one state under such specific conditions @xcite .",
    "the coherence factors are evaluated between two states that differ by an electron , whose structure and symmetry properties depend on the physical parameter set of the dqd and how the individual dots couple to the two electrodes .",
    "the general definition is as follows : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the creation / annihilation operators for an electronic state on the end dot coupled with the corresponding electrode , and @xmath95 is the bare left or right electrode coupling factor defined in section i. in our case , the coherence factors are evaluated between the a ) @xmath82 bonding and @xmath84 singlet : @xmath96 b ) @xmath82 bonding and @xmath86 triplet states : @xmath97 recall that the transport feature central to the pauli blockade experiments is the occurrence of multiple ndr s @xcite along both bias directions , and this condition must be recast into the model developed in the first section .",
    "therefore , the basic criterion for ndr to occur along the positive bias ( @xmath98 ) direction is : @xmath99 and along the negative bias direction ( @xmath100 ) is : @xmath101 notice that ndr conditions in the above equations also include degeneracy factors as depicted in fig.5 . a direct substitution from eqs  [ eq : rate_bs ] and  [ eq : rate_bt ] with @xmath102 yields @xmath103 along the positive bias direction and @xmath104 along the negative bias direction .",
    "to apply these relations we need to consider the wavefunction coefficients @xmath105,@xmath106,@xmath107,@xmath108 , and @xmath89 in more detail .",
    "consider first the wavefunction coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath105 for the @xmath80 bonding state @xmath109 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath110 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 when @xmath113 , given that @xmath114 .",
    "the two electron triplet ( see fig .",
    "5 ) is relatively un - affected by electronic structure variations , but the singlet state described by the wavefunction coefficients @xmath115 and @xmath89 requires some more discussion .    the presence of a single electron ( fig.6 ) in one dot influences the addition of another on either of them as a result of on - site or long range coulomb interaction .",
    "for @xmath116 relative magnitudes of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath89 now depend on off - sets between the total energies of the three configurations shown in fig.6 which we shall consider now .",
    "_ transport scenarios : _ consider three transport scenarios depicted in fig.7 , which are based on the relative offsets between orbital energies @xmath117 , and relative offsets between the two electron wavefunction configurations ( fig.6 ) @xmath118 , and @xmath119 . in all our simulations",
    "we have used parameters consistent with a weakly - coupled dqd structure in @xcite , with @xmath120mev , @xmath121mev , and @xmath122mev , while other parameters are varied to the three cases depicted in fig.7 .",
    "_ case i : coulomb staircase : _ in first scenario shown in fig.7a , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , which implies @xmath125 and @xmath126 . a straightforward evaluation of coherence factors from eqs  [ eq : rate_bs ] ,  [ eq : rate_bt ] implies that the criterion for ndr given in eq .",
    "[ eq : sbc1 ] ,  [ eq : sbc2 ] is never satisfied , leading to regular cb staircase i - v characteristics shown in fig.8a @xcite . in this case , both left and right contacts act are equally efficient in electron - addition and removal processes and hence no such blocking states can be formed .",
    "thus the ndr phenomenon is absent .    _ case ii : forward bias current collapse : _ in this case @xmath127 , which implies that the two electron state @xmath128 is almost degenerate with @xmath129 implying that both electrons , _ whenever in a singlet state _ can either reside inside dot 2 alone or one in both dots . the condition @xmath114 makes it energetically unfavorable to access @xmath130 resulting in @xmath131 . under these conditions , note that our forward bias ndr condition ( eq .  [ eq : sbc1 ] ,  [ eq : sbc1b ] ) results in @xmath132 which is trivially satisfied in our case @xmath114 . the i - v characteristics now show a prominent ndr as shown in fig.8b , noted in the experimental trace shown in fig.8d . the parameter @xmath105 dictates how effective the right contact ( also see eq .",
    "[ eq : rate_bt ] ) is , in the electron removal process between the triplet and bonding states .",
    "recall that @xmath133 when @xmath62 , implying that the right contact has a very in - efficient triplet removal , thus blocking the triplet within the dqd system .",
    "this causes a current collapse once the population of triplet state is energetically feasible .",
    "the forward bias i - v shown in fig.8b shows a strong ndr with current collapse leading to a small leakage current , once the bias permits the access of transport channel @xmath134 in the bias window . in the fock space picture ( fig.4c,5 ) , current at lower bias due to @xmath135 drops once the transition @xmath136 occurs since @xmath137 is a blocking state .",
    "note that , when transitions @xmath135 and @xmath136 are simultaneously accessed , the system is put in a blocking state once threshold is reached , thereby no ndr occurs .",
    "this is shown dotted in fig.8b and occurs experimentally @xcite , upon application of gate potential , thereby changing the relative position of threshold voltage .",
    "we also find that , a finite but small leakage current in the order of @xmath138 pa occurs due to a finite @xmath139 corresponding to the leakage of triplet into a bonding state .",
    "importantly this leakage current reduces by further detuning the dots , making the bonding state more localized on the second dot , such that @xmath140 . since @xmath141",
    "we see a clear asymmetry between the two bias directions in the i - v characteristics .",
    "_ case iii : multiple current collapse : _ seldom do parameters exactly match the condition @xmath127 , experimentally thus making it possible for reverse bias ndr s too .",
    "this corresponds to the scenario depicted in fig.7c . the important consequence of eqs .",
    "[ eq : ndr ] ,  [ eq : ndr2 ] was that ndr along a bias direction only depends on how the blocking state is coupled to the emptying reservoir .",
    "now the negative bias ( @xmath100 ) ndr condition simply is @xmath142 , which is also satisfied when @xmath143 . under these conditions , shown in fig.7c,8c a mild ndr is noted even in the reverse direction , in good match with experimental ( fig.8d , e ) observations @xcite .",
    "the experimental i - v s also show a lifting of spin blockade followed by successive ndr s at higher positive bias directions .",
    "the lifting of ndr s can be explained simply due to access of transport channels between two electron higher excitations and one electron antibonding states .",
    "a consistent match with experimental features , will however involve the inclusion of more orbitals within each dot , such as p - type orbitals , which we shall address in a future work .",
    "the fundamentals of ndr s , collapse and rectification still remain within our general framework derived in this paper .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a general model for multiple current collapse ( ndrs ) to occur in the i - v characteristics of strongly interacting systems using the idea of blocking transport channels . with the aid of this model , we have provided an interpretation of non - linear transport through",
    "weakly coupled quantum dots in the pauli spin blockade regime .",
    "our model captures subtle experimental observations in this regime , that includes multiple current collapses which are gateable , leakage currents , and rectification , all of which are consistent with the experimental double quantum dot setup .",
    "we believe that this model can be exploited in the understanding of other novel blockade mechanisms that can arise from different internal degrees inside a coulomb blockaded system .",
