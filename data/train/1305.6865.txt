    "the linear operators @xmath18 , @xmath9 , have the form @xmath21 where , for some fixed exponent @xmath22 , the kernels @xmath23 satisfy the size and continuity conditions @xmath24 .",

    "a prequel to this article is @xcite by the first two authors , establishing a @xmath2 type theorem to characterise the @xmath25-boundedness of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
