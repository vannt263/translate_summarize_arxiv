    "this provides a convenient reference position with displacement @xmath31 for every atom @xmath32 . from hooke s law after applying linearization , the force on atom @xmath32 exerted by a directly connected neighbor @xmath33 is @xmath34 where the symmetric matrix @xmath35 is the modulus tensor and @xmath36 arises from the homogeneous stress in flat films .",

    "mechanical equilibrium requires @xmath45 for each atom @xmath32 .",
    "this leads to a large set of equations coupling the displacements @xmath46 of @xmath47 the atoms .",
    "conventionally , this large set of equations is solved directly using approximation schemes @xcite .",
    "the solution then gives the elastic energy stored in every spring and their sum gives the total elastic energy @xmath26 of the whole system in mechanical equilibrium .",
    "calculating @xmath26 twice with and without the atom @xmath17 and comparing the values give @xmath25 .",
    "this has to be done in principle for every topmost atom @xmath17 after every successful atomic hop involving non - adatoms .",
    "fast algorithms are hence indispensable .    our green s function method to be explained in the next section",
    "is a variant of the boundary integral method ; it directly calculates the displacement of the surface atoms only .",
    "we show here that this is already sufficient for calculating the elastic energy @xmath26 of the whole system .",
    "first , a surface atom is defined as one which has at least one spring missing .",
    "there are hence more surface atoms than topmost atoms .",
    "consider virtual forces which adiabatically increase from 0 to @xmath48 applied to every surface atom @xmath33 where @xmath49 is summed over all missing atoms which could have been directly connected to @xmath33 .",
    "these forces push all atoms from their mechanical equilibrium positions to their homogeneously strained lattice positions , i.e. a displacement @xmath50 .",
    "the virtual work done , @xmath51 , is given by @xmath52 it equals the difference @xmath53 . here",
    ", @xmath54 denotes the strain energy of the homogeneously strained lattice and can be straightforwardly computed by simple bond counting .",
    "therefore , the elastic energy @xmath26 of the whole system is given by @xmath55 which depends only on the positions of the surface atoms @xcite .",
    "we now explain in detail the green s function method which reduces the elasticity problem into one involving explicit consideration of only the surface atoms .",
    "this leads to a greatly reduced set of equations and dramatically reduces the computational burden .",
    "it is analogous to boundary integral methods @xcite . either full - space or half - space green s functions defined on an extended lattice with regular boundaries can be used .",
    "more importantly , it is exact for arbitrary morphologies .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to half - space green s functions in the small slope approximation which are often applied @xcite .",
    "first , as a mathematical construct , we enlarge the lattice representing arbitrary morphology by adding @xmath56 atoms with similar elastic properties to form an extended lattice with regular boundaries .",
    "unphysical couplings are hence introduced but can be exactly cancelled . the precise method to achieve this",
    "is not unique .",
    "we will first explain a displacement - based green s function method which has been applied in our simulations @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we will also introduce closely related force - based and hypersingular displacement - based green s function formalisms .",
    "they are not currently adopted but have distinct properties which may lead to other applications in the future .",
    "for all these formalisms , we take periodic boundary conditions in lateral directions and fixed boundary conditions at the bottom of the substrate as dictated by the lattice model . for the top layer in the extended lattice ,",
    "we adopt fixed boundary conditions but free boundary conditions are equally good since all their influences will be exactly cancelled anyway .",

    "therefore , the problem defined on the extended lattice with the applied forces is identical to the original physical one .",

    "figure [ fig - disp ] shows the calculated displacements of both surface and bulk atoms in the cross - section of a film from a small scale 3d simulation .",
    "another interesting property of eq .",
    "( [ ui_new ] ) is that the long - range nature of the elastic interactions is reflected in the coupling coefficient @xmath72 which decays as @xmath73 in 3d at large @xmath74 where @xmath74 is the distance between atoms @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the coupling of the displacements of the surface atoms is also long - ranged as expected and should not be casually truncated .",

    "similar to eq .",

    "( [ fe - force ] ) gives @xmath80 this is the main set of equations in the force - based formalism .",

    "( [ force - fe ] ) also decays as @xmath73 with the distance @xmath74 as in the previous displacement - based case .",

    "<S> they become dome islands bounded mainly by ( 113 ) facet planes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , large dislocated islands appear . for the closely related alloy variant si@xmath0ge@xmath1/si(100 ) with a generally lower @xmath2% misfit , the development is rather similar and goes through stages characterized by ripples , hut islands , dome islands and finally dislocated islands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the structures are however larger and each transition is postponed to occur at a larger film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the islands are also more closely packed .    </S>",
    "<S> islands self - assemble because they can relieve the elastic stress in the heteroepitaxial films . </S>",
    "<S> there is theory for island formation that emphasizes nucleation . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that islands must overcome an energy barrier associated with a critical size so that the elastic energy gained can balance the extra surface energy cost @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is reasonably consistent with experiments at relatively high misfit . at low misfit , the critical island size and hence the energy barrier </S>",
    "<S> are expected to increase and make nucleation prohibitively difficult . </S>",
    "<S> island formation mechanisms which do not have a barrier then offer a more promising explanation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , according to the asaro - tiller - grinfeld ( atg ) theory @xcite , strained surfaces are unstable at sufficiently long wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , shallow ripples first develop from small random initial perturbations and then into islands . </S>",
    "<S> for this mechanism to operate the temperature must be above the surface roughening transition point . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be the case for the ( 100 ) plane of a si@xmath0ge@xmath1 which is not a true facet at the experimentally relevant temperatures @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> direct simulation of the growth of a strained film is much more challenging computationally than for the unstrained case because of the long - range nature of elastic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> early kinetic monte carlo simulations in two dimensions ( 2d ) based on ball and spring lattice models by orr et . </S>",
    "<S> al @xcite , barabasi @xcite , and khor and das sarma @xcite have successfully observed island formation on strained films at sufficiently high misfits . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism is consistent with the nucleation picture . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations focus on the high misfit regime because islands can then be small enough to be computationally manageable . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , much enhanced computational efficiency has been achieved using an exact green s function method for the elasticity problem of surface atoms . </S>",
    "<S> using also a superparticle coarsening approximation and a hopping acceptance - rejection sampling method , a much wider range of morphologies for both high and low temperature regimes characterized respectively by instability and nucleation roughening mechanisms in both 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite have been explored . </S>",
    "<S> another advanced approach for the elasticity problem based on the fast fourier transform and a multi - grid method applied respectively to the substrate and film has also been derived @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of these studies work for general film morphologies . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one can limit the study to the evolution of only shallow structures and solve the elastic problem using the half - space green s function in the small - slope approximation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> other computational approaches offer different compromises between accurate representation of the physics and computational efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , continuum simulations using driven diffusion equations with the elastic energy term obtained using finite element or similar methods are computationally less intensive . the atg instability is readily demonstrated @xcite and effects of surface anisotropy @xcite as well as island coarsening @xcite can be studied in 3d . the importance of alloy segregation @xcite and formation of more complicated structures @xcite have also been studied recently . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , fluctuations in the atomic scale and lattice discreteness are not accounted for and hence island nucleation and growth at sub - roughening transition temperatures can not be studied . </S>",
    "<S> also , off - lattice models are more realistic and island formation can be simulated at moderate length scales in 2d@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , molecular models using realistic semiconductor atomic potentials have provided better understanding of island stress distribution @xcite and facet structures @xcite in static calculations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , first principles calculations focus on the statics of fewer atoms but are able to provide important estimates for the surface energies of relevant facets bounding the islands @xcite .    thus kinetic monte carlo methods based on lattice models are unique in allowing large scale dynamic simulations for studying properties for which atomic discreteness is important while fine details of the atomic potential and surface energies are of limited qualitative impacts . in the following , we will explain in detail the algorithms used in ref . </S>",
