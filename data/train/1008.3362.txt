    "recently the use of metamaterials as wave absorbers has been attracting the interest of many researchers from the viewpoint of feasible metamaterial applications using current technology . since the first experimental metamaterial work was reported by smith et al .",
    "@xcite , various metamaterials have been proposed to realise their exotic properties , such as negative permittivity , negative permeability and negative refractive index ( nri ) , from the microwave region to the optical region @xcite . at the same time",
    "many metamaterial applications have also been suggested ; the superlens @xcite , invisible cloaking @xcite and optical transformation @xcite to name but a few . however , there are obstacles in the realisation of these schemes .",
    "most metamaterial applications rely on the negative properties described above . at high frequencies , such as terahertz and optical bands ,",
    "the properties have non  zero imaginary parts of refractive index and wave impedance mainly due to the conductive loss of the metal components , making the applications less attractive or sometimes unrealistic . for this reason",
    "the conductive loss issue is recognised as a problem to be solved @xcite and many researchers are trying to address this matter , for example , by the use of gain mediums @xcite or by optical transformation designs that include the conductive loss @xcite .",
    "in this paper we seek to exploit these losses for efficient absorber design . in metamaterial absorbers",
    "the use of the conductive loss can be taken into account as part of the absorber design to achieve strong levels of absorptance .",
    "thus the practical use of metamaterials as wave absorbers is becoming popular for applications in areas such as emc , crosstalk reduction etc .",
    "so far metamaterial absorbers have exhibited attractive features which are not available from conventional wave absorbers .",
    "one example is in the manipulation of the electromagnetic properties . in conventional absorbers design options",
    "are limited by substrate properties and mixture ratios to realise desired permittivity and permeability values .",
    "this is not easy to accomplish . in this paper",
    "we aim at systematic design techniques for metamaterial absorbers to enable us to modify their electromagnetic properties with relative ease ( e.g. changes in metallisation length and geometry ) .",
    "more importantly the use of metamaterials makes the absorber substrate thicknesses significantly smaller . in the conventional absorbers the total thickness of the structures need to be comparable to a quarter wavelength @xmath1 of the operating frequency .",
    "however , the @xmath2 thickness can limit the range of application , for example , where available working space is restricted .",
    "this issue has successfully been solved by use of thin metamaterials , which allowed us to relax the limitation of the physical size remarkably ( e.g. in @xcite 1 mm thickness at operating frequency 6 ghz , i.e. approximately one fiftieth of the wavelength ) , and more flexible design options became possible .",
    "an outstanding issue is the limitation of the absorption band width . in most cases absorption",
    "is concentrated in a narrow frequency band .",
    "although narrow band absorbers may be useful in some applications , the real need is for broadband absorbers with customised characteristics to meet specific user needs .",
    "this paper shows that highly customisable broadband absorption is possible using metamaterials as wave absorber .",
    "different lengths of conductive and lossy cut  wires ( cw ) ( see insets of figs .",
    "[ fig : modelfield ] ( a ) and ( b ) as examples of cws ) are deployed as a single periodic metamaterial absorber unit .",
    "highly customisable absorption is achieved by independent conductive loss optimisation in each cw . in addition , this absorption can be obtained for arbitrary polarisations without any serious absorptance reduction when other pairs of cws are introduced .",
    "furthermore , it is also demonstrated that not only enhancing the absorptance but also reducing it is possible by use of additional cws .",
    "these results indicate that the cws make it possible to design very flexible absorptance characteristics . before the customisable absorber configurations",
    "are explained in detail , this paper introduces characteristics of lossless cw metamaterials in section [ sec : material ] then examines the basic properties of cw metamaterials in sections [ sec : singleandpaired ] . in section",
    "[ sec : cwpec ] the customised broadband absorber designs are introduced and conclusion is made in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "previous work is described in @xcite which was done using limited numerical resolution .",
    "this work is extended here to develop customised absorbers .",
    "this paper uses a thin rectangular metal form , the so  called cw , as a base metal geometry for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the cw metamaterials are very simple structures and the periodic unit is composed of only a dielectric substrate and a single or paired cw . due to their simplicity ,",
    "cw metamaterials can be transformed into other types of metamaterials @xcite , so they play an important role in basic metamaterial research .",
    "secondly , the cw metamaterials do not require any extra metal components to yield a nri .",
    "for example , the first metamaterial @xcite is composed of split  ring resonators , yielding a negative value of permeability , and long metal strips , yielding a negative value of permittivity , and hence two types of metal structures are necessary to produce a nri .",
    "however , the cw metamaterials can exhibit both negative permittivity and permeability through a simply paired cw .",
    "thirdly , cw structures are suitable for introducing stronger losses .",
    "as is reported in @xcite , compared to fishnet structures @xcite which have some similar properties with those cw metamaterials have , the cw metamaterials can exhibit greater losses , which although undesirable in most metamaterial applications they are needed in absorber applications . moreover , from a fabrication viewpoint , the cw form is straightforward to manufacture due to its simple geometry . finally , cws with conductive loss easily produce multi  absorptance peaks as will be demonstrated in this paper .    in absorber applications described in this paper conductive loss",
    "is used instead of dielectric loss which is assumed to be a primary resource in most metamaterial absorbers ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the reasons is that materials with suitable conductive losses are readily available through recently developed technologies , e.g. conductive inks @xcite .",
    "also , independent optimisation of the metal resistances gives us more flexible options for absorption characteristic designs , e.g. multi  peak broadband absorption , as will be demonstrated in section [ sec : cwpec ] .",
    "the default structures of the simulated cw metamaterials are illustrated in the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig : modelfield ] ( a ) and ( b ) for single and paired cws and the simulations were performed by using the transmission line modelling ( tlm ) method @xcite .",
    "to simplify the situation and consider the absorption effect due only to the conductive loss of the cw metals , the relative permittivity @xmath3 of the substrate was set @xmath4 and all other loss mechanisms were removed .",
    "the cw structure had a width of 0.3 mm along the @xmath5 axis ( @xmath6field ) and a length of 5.1 mm along the @xmath7 axis ( @xmath8field ) .",
    "the dimension of the unit cell was @xmath9 mm .",
    "this structure was modelled using cubical tlm unit cells having edge lengths of @xmath10 mm .",
    "the sheet resistance @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) used to quantify the conductive loss was allocated so that the scattering coefficients from the metal are determined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively represent reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient both multiplied by the incident voltage ( the incident wave ) in each tlm unit cell , @xmath16 is the impedance in vacuum and @xmath17 .",
    "the scattering parameters were calculated using observation planes 15 mm away from the absorber surface and a gaussian pulse was excited on a plane one cell above the observation plane for the reflection coefficient . since periodic boundaries were applied for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 plane boundaries , the cw metamaterial absorber unit modelled was assumed to belong to infinite array on the bottom @xmath20 plane .    the simulated paired cw metamaterials are generally known to exhibit two types of resonances : electric resonances and magnetic resonances @xcite .",
    "these resonances are explained in fig . [",
    "fig : modelfield ] where the reflection coefficient , the electric fields and the conduction currents of the cw metamaterials all calculated by tlm method are illustrated .",
    "when an incident wave is excited with the electric field parallel to the direction of the cw metals , the conduction currents flow in opposite directions in each cw at the magnetic resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : modelfield ] ( d ) ) .",
    "this is the minimum @xmath21 at 24.89 ghz in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelfield ] ( b ) . in this case",
    "the electric field is anti ",
    "parallel at the two edges of the cw metamaterial , fig .",
    "[ fig : modelfield ] ( c ) , and a magnetic field concentrated within the area bounded by the paired cw is generated .",
    "this magnetic field plays the role of an artificial magnetic dipole and can lead to a negative value of permeability . on the other hand , at the electric resonance found at around an @xmath21 peak ( 26.71 ghz in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelfield ] ( b ) ) , conduction currents in the cws become dominant , resulting in a strong unidirectional electric field at the edges of the cws , figs .",
    "[ fig : modelfield ] ( e ) and ( f ) . similarly with the magnetic resonance this electric field behaves as an artificial electric dipole so as to produce a negative value of permittivity .",

    "[ fig : modelfield ] ( a ) ) as well .",

    "the calculation results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( a ) and the strong absorptances of @xmath37 are seen .",
    "considering the results obtained , the case of the cw with the metal backing gives the highest absorptance ( @xmath38 ) followed by two cws without the metal backing ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "finally a single cw gives the lowest absorption ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we note that the conduction currents in each case are different as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelfield ] ( d ) .",
    "next the same pattern of cws was deployed along the @xmath5 axis to reduce polarisation dependence .",
    "the calculation results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( b ) , where the sheet resistance of each cw were again optimised . the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( b ) describes the simulated structure . as a result of the comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( a ) , strong absorptance of @xmath37 is still maintained despite the use of another orthogonal cw . according to @xcite , straight conductors orthogonal to the electric field",
    "do not react with the external field significantly so that the electromagnetic properties of the whole structure are not significantly affected .    to obtain broadband behaviour some or all of the pairs of the cws used in fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( b ) are combined as one metamaterial unit .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( c ) illustrates the structure .",
    "the calculation results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( c ) .",
    "the results in this figure indicate that the absorptance properties in the high frequency region are improved by use of additional lossy pairs of cw .",
    "the addition of extra cws introduces additional absorption peaks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( d ) where two cw pairs of 5.1 and 3.3 mm show two absorptance peaks corresponding to those of the individual cws .",
    "although such behaviour has been recently reported @xcite , the advantage of using the lossy cws introduced here is to easily customise the absorptance characteristics for _ both _ polarisations .",
    "furthermore , as is explained below , it is also easy to realise several absorptance peaks by adding extra pairs of cw .",
    "the absorption characteristics may be further enhanced by optimising the sheet resistance values .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( e ) in which the three cw pairs of 5.1 , 3.9 and 3.3 mm are deployed . in this figure",
    "the sheet resistance value of only the 3.3 mm cw is varied , while the values of the other cws are the same as those of fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( b ) .",
    "it is found from fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( e ) that the absorption characteristics are improved by use of adjusted resistance values , leading to a triple absorptance peak ( 0.993 at 24.28 ghz , 0.975 at 31.17 ghz and 0.981 at 36.29 ghz ) .",
    "again , this structure will interact with both polarisations , compared with that of @xcite and is an important advantage of the lossy cw metamaterial absorber .",
    "although only the triple absorptance peak is illustrated , further absorptance peaks are possible by using extra cw pairs .",
    "use of additional pairs of cw enables us not only to increase absorption , but also to decrease it . in fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( f ) , the absorptance of the cw metamaterial absorber composed of 5.1 and 3.9 mm cw pairs with the sheet resistance values used in fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( b ) is illustrated .",
    "this absorptance peaks can be enhanced by use of optimised sheet resistance values as is described in the figure .",
    "in addition to these two cw pairs , when the lossless cw pair of 3.9 mm is deployed ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( f ) ) , the absorptance magnitude between the two absorption peaks is markedly reduced due to the resonance of the 3.9 mm cw pair ( where the sheet resistance values of 5.1 and 3.9 mm cws were modified again ) . as expected , the centre of the absorptance reduction is close to the resonant frequency of the 3.9 mm cw ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : backmetalmulti ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this allows for a fully customised absorptance characteristic .",
    "this paper demonstrated by numerical simulation that highly customisable broadband absorption for arbitrary polarisation is possible by use of conductively lossy cws as metamaterial absorbers . to begin with , the basic properties of the conductively lossy cw metamaterial absorbers were investigated .",
    "a dependence of absorptance peak on the conductive loss was explained with a simple equivalent circuit . in paired cw metamaterials ,",
    "absorptance peaks were improved by manipulating the two resonance frequency positions and by using independent sheet resistance values for the front and back cws .",
    "the absorptance of the conductively lossy cw metamaterial was further improved , when single cw metamaterials were placed on a pec wall .",
    "moreover , when different lengths of cws were combined as one metamaterial unit , broadband absorption was exhibited .",
    "the deployment of orthogonal pairs of cws showed that the structure simulated here works for both polarisations . due to the flexible absorptance characteristics",
    ", the idea of using conductively lossy cw pairs adds additional advantages to metamaterial absorbers and opens up a new area for metamaterial applications .",
    "the interesting properties of cw metamaterials may be further improved , when the structures are designed to absorb off  normal incident waves .",
    "this may be possible by using multiple cws whose lengths and sheet resistance values are suitably optimised ."
