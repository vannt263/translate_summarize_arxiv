    "marine primary production is generally controlled by the availability of light and nutrients . in the ocean , light decreases exponentially with depth , limiting photosynthesis to the upper part of the ocean , the euphotic zone . + the ` critical depth model ' @xcite describes the relation between the depth of the surface mixed layer and the capability of light - dependent phytoplankton net growth .",

    "hence , there exists a critical depth where the vertically integrated growth is equal to the vertically integrated loss .",
    "@xcite concluded that net phytoplankton growth is only possible if the mixed layer depth ( mld ) is less than the critical depth , thus , allowing for positive net growth .",
    "+ during winter the mld in the north atlantic reaches depths of several hundred metres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore would not allow net phytoplankton growth according to the ` critical depth model ' , that is unless the loss terms are sufficiently low , and thus , result in a sufficiently deep critical depth ( critical depth @xmath0 mld ) . in this context , @xcite proposed the so - called ` dilution - recoupling hypothesis ' , which based upon earlier work by @xcite , arguing that the dilution of phytoplankton by mixed layer deepening reduces the grazing pressure on phytoplankton , and thus , lowers this loss term during winter .",
    "this hypothesis has been updated to the more general ` disturbance - recoupling hypothesis ' @xcite stating that during the annual cycle the predator - prey interaction is disrupted by environmental factors as , for example , convection , and subsequently recovers .",
    "this disruption then allows for net primary production due to low grazing pressure while concentrations still stay low due to convective mixing .",
    "+        ocean convection  the buoyancy - driven sinking of surface waters due to surface cooling or an increase in surface salinity  is one of the key processes affecting the winter mixed layer deepening . due to mass conservation",
    "the sinking of water parcels leads to a balancing upward motion , and thus , convection can be described as an orbital motion . especially in the north atlantic ocean",
    "extensive convectively driven mixed layer deepening can be observed during winter .",

    "+ as a consequence of these two restrictions , models which do not a priori consider all variables to be homogeneously distributed within the mixed layer , may not represent the vertical exchange of water mass properties and phytoplankton in deep mlds properly .",

    "for the first test run we chose a deeper @xmath65 of 200 m compared to @xmath64 m in the previously discussed phytoconvection run , which also enlarged the transition range , where both the standard parameterisation and the phytoconvective parameterisation are taken into account .",

    "these dynamics are also visible in the temperature increase near the surface . during the same time",
    ", the mld shows only a slight decline demonstrating that the mld and the @xmath41 deviate stronger during early spring .",
    "this period of three days of no convective mixing is followed by another period of strong convection causing a deepening of the mixed layer by almost 100 m .",
    "the temperature within the whole mixed layer also significantly decreases during this time .",
    "convection eventually drops on april 6th ( day 97 ) followed by the formation of a shallow surface mixed layer .",
    "the onset of thermal stratification is delayed compared to the shutdown of convection by about two days .",

    "+ the ratio @xmath52 is about 0.38 throughout the winter period ( january - march ) in the 3d phytoconvection run due to the spatial aspect ratio of 2.5:1 ( horizontal to vertical ) of the convection cell and an euphotic layer depth of 40 m to 50 m . to evaluate this value we calculated the median values of @xmath57 and @xmath43 for the 200 lagrangian tracers added to the first simulation .",
    "the median was used rather than the average value to retrieve values less influenced by strong outliers occurring in the tracer results .",
    "we derived the values by considering tracers with an actual light value of above or equal 1% of the surface light being within the euphotic zone , thus , counting for @xmath57 .",
    "tracers with light values below this threshold were taken into account for the dark time @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath43 was calculated as the sum of the median values of @xmath57 and @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting median values for @xmath57 and @xmath43 are about 0.08 hours and about 0.42 hours , respectively , resulting in a ratio @xmath52 of about 0.2 .",
    "this shows that the ratio @xmath52 during the 3d simulation is most likely overestimated causing an overestimation of the simulated phytoplankton .",
    "the short median duration of @xmath57 and @xmath43 suggests that particles in a convectively mixed layer are not always transported down to the bottom of the mixed layer , but spend a lot of time in the upper layers and frequently re - enter the euphotic zone .",
    "however , laboratory experiments showed that phytoplankton dealing with short light - dark cycles is less productive than that dealing with longer cycle due to photoacclimation ( b. walter , unpublished data ) .",
    "this is not taken into account in our parameterisation as the different light - dark cycles are not represented and would probably lower the simulated phytoplankton concentrations .",
    "however , all tracer trajectories ( not presented ) show that particles also spend longer continuous periods in different depths since convection is intermittent .",
    "thus , it is likely that a certain proportion of phytoplankton stays sufficiently long in the euphotic zone and net primary production can take place .",
    "+ there are some differences between 2d and 3d modelling of turbulent convection , a point worth noting .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that in the case of a free convective boundary layer as assumed by the model , the turbulent kinetic energy ( tke ) , surface friction velocity and velocity variances are sensitive to the subgrid - scale eddy viscosity and thermal diffusivity in 2d models .",
    "especially the vertical velocity variance is significantly higher in 2d models than in 3d which affects the vertical mass fluxes @xcite .",
    "hence , a 3d simulation using the same boundary conditions would lead to different results regarding the tke , and thus , to a different @xmath41 and mld , respectively .",
    "@xcite showed that at the mixed layer base 2d models tend to simulate a lower vertical diffusivity compared to 3d models which may affect the temporal development of @xmath41 . even though such model would most likely yield a quantitatively different result",
    ", this does not affect the validity of our assumption that the mld equals the @xmath41 during winter as we do not expect another qualitative result from a 3d model .",
    "with respect to the vertical displacement of particles by convection , the differences in the vertical velocities would affect the simulated duration of a full convective orbit , and thus , the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "the presented parameterisation of phytoconvection ( equation ) combined with the developed weighting function constitutes a possible approach to reproduce observed winter phytoplankton concentrations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a large - scale physical - biogeochemical model . in these models the vertical exchange is often not sufficient to account for convective mixing , and thus , to adequately simulate phytoplankton concentrations within the deep winter mixed layer .",
    "this parameterisation incorporates the hypothesis of @xcite by allowing primary production throughout the whole mixed layer , and thus , increasing winter phytoplankton productivity .",
    "the resulting parameterisation ( equation ) is able to simulate winter phytoplankton concentrations in convective regions which are in good agreement to the available observations whereas the conventional parameterisation of primary production fails to reproduce the observations .",
    "the more realistic winter phytoplankton concentrations and the accordingly higher carbon export production in the phytoconvection run suggest that convection non - resolving , biogeochemical models underestimate the carbon export as they also underestimate the phytoplankton concentrations in these depths , and hence , the sinking of particulate organic carbon .",
    "+ beyond this , for the first time the parameterisation proposed by @xcite was tested and implemented into a large - scale 3d biogeochemical ocean model .",
    "thus , it was possible to investigate the effect of this parameterisation on the simulated ecosystem , for example , nutrients and zooplankton . even though only primary production is directly influenced by the parameterisation ,",
    "nutrients and zooplankton are also affected .",
    "however , the increase in zooplankton grazing and the reduction of nutrients in the pre - bloom phase only have a minor effect on the phytoplankton bloom development .",
    "thus , these results question the relative importance of changes in the density - dependent grazing pressure during winter as formulated in the ` disturbance - recoupling hypothesis ' @xcite .",
    "+ in addition , the regional model ecoham4 served as a testing environment for the application of the parameterisation of phytoconvection in a global ocean model .",
    "the promising results with respect to phytoplankton concentrations suggest this step to investigate the effect on the phytoplankton and carbon export on a global scale . + the parameterisation presented relies on a number of assumptions regarding the characteristics of convection and the functioning of primary production .",
    "first , it is assumed that the mld is frequently mixed by convection during winter , thus , providing a valid measure for the vertical extent of convection .",
    "this was confirmed by the results of the convection model , although the applied mld criterion overestimates the actual convective mixing depth @xmath41 .",
    "second , the convection cell is assumed to have a rectangular shape with a horizontal to vertical aspect ratio of 2.5:1 @xcite and particles moving with constant velocity along linear pathways .",
    "the median timescales of @xmath57 and @xmath43 resulting from the tracer experiment showed that this simplification leads to an overestimation of the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "the short timescales also suggest that the actual motion within the convection cell is rather turbulent than linear which also effects the particle velocity .",
    "horizontal current velocities in the ocean are usually larger than vertical velocities . hence , assuming increased horizontal velocities would lead to a reduction of @xmath57 and consequently lower primary production .",
    "the short light - dark cycles show that the simulated phytoplankton is biased by neglecting the effect of photoacclimation resulting in a further overestimation .",
    "consequently , taking into account these aspects would most likely result in an overall lower primary production during winter .",
    "+ since primary production depends on absolute values of par , primary production taking place in depths deeper than the 1%-threshold depth could partly balance this decrease in primary production as it would increase @xmath57 .",
    "though it is not likely to have a strong effect during mid - winter when radiation is generally low , it may have a beneficial effect during march when surface radiation increases , and thus , primary production may occur in greater depth .",
    "variation in respiration is another aspect not accounted for in the applied model .",
    "it is known that phytoplankton respiration rates decrease under low light conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , including this effect is expected to increase the simulated npp and , consequently , phytoplankton concentrations .",
    "however , we did not address these aspects and further studies are needed to analyse their influence on our parameterisation of phytoconvection .",
    "+ besides this the analysis of the new parameterisation revealed some other points requiring improvement . considering that the mld is the main controlling factor in both the paramerisation of phytoconvection and in the transition between the winter and summer regimes , the use of a higher vertical resolution between 200 m to 600 m depth would improve its accuracy in spatially explicit , especially during the decline of the mld . such improvement",
    "would also be associated with increased computation times .",
    "there is also the need of improving the mld criterion itself to account for haline stratification .",
    "this could be achieved by applying a density - based criterion following the algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the mld criterion applied here with those based on a temperature difference of 0.8k proposed by @xcite showed that these criteria yield even deeper mlds which are less consistent with the simulated temperature distribution ( see fig .  fig : temphov ) .",
    "hence , further testing is needed to obtain the best - fitting criterion and to include the effect of salinity .",
    "+ the introduction of the weighting function allowed the smooth transition between winter and summer regimes with deep and shallow mixed layers , respectively .",
    "in addition , the weighting function produced improved results in the deep open ocean and shallow shelf regions .",
    "however , with respect to the transition from a deep to a shallow mixed layer , further improvement of the weighting between the conventional parameterisation and the parameterisation of phytoconvection is required . + the simulations with the convection model showed that during phases of reduced convective mixing the mld shows only a slight response , even though these phases last for a couple of days .",
    "the simulations also showed that there is a temporal mismatch between the final shutdown of convection and the decline of the mld .",
    "thus , a possible improvement to the weighting function as well as to the ratio @xmath52 ( see equations and ) would be the coupling to the @xmath41 rather than to the mld .",
    "+ the vertical exchange coefficients used in some hydrostatic models ( as for example the hamsom model ) in combination with the low vertical resolution are not always sufficient to account for convective mixing of particles . on the other hand ,",
    "convection - resolving models are not feasible to large - scale models due to immense computation times , which represents the major challenge for the further improvement of the here presented parameterisation of phytoconvection . for this purpose",
    ", a possible solution could be the coupling of the parameterisation of phytoconvection to the air - sea heat flux , a proxy for convective mixing .",
    "@xcite used the net surface heat flux to show that the shutdown of convection can be a better indicator for the onset of the bloom than the mld .",
    "however , other mechanisms , e.g. eddy - driven stratification @xcite can lead to stratification without a change in the net surface heat flux , and would , thus , still not be captured by this approach . + besides these possible and necessary improvements and the further analysis of the underlying assumptions , another important step is the application of the presented parameterisation in a model region where sufficient observation data are available to obtain a significant image of the quality of the parameterisation . such can be achieved with the help of other large - scale , physical - biogeochemical models , used to calculate growth dependency on the local par in depth @xmath5 .",
    "the parameterisation of phytoconvection presented here is based on the originally implemented parameterisation of light - dependent primary production , and thus , is expected to be applicable by the vast majority of this type of models .",

    "<S> this study presents a parameterisation called ` phytoconvection ' which focuses on the influence of convection on primary production . </S>",
    "<S> this parameterisation was implemented into a three - dimensional physical - biogeochemical model and applied to the northwestern european continental shelf and areas of the adjacent northeast atlantic . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation was compared to a ` conventional ' parameterisation with respect to its influence on phytoplankton concentrations during the annual cycle and its effect on the carbon cycle . </S>",
    "<S> + the simulation using the new parameterisation showed good agreement with observation data recorded during winter , whereas the reference simulation did not capture the observed phytoplankton concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the new parameterisation had a strong influence on the carbon export through the sinking of particulate organic carbon . </S>",
    "<S> the carbon export during late winter / early spring significantly exceeded the export of the reference run . </S>",
    "<S> + furthermore , a non - hydrostatic convection model was used to evaluate the major assumption of the presented parameterisation which implies the matching of the mixed layer depth with the convective mixing depth . </S>",
    "<S> the applied mixed layer depth criterion principally overestimates the actual convective mixing depth . </S>",
