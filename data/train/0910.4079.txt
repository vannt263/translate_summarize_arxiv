    "a huge effort has been made in the past decades to observe @xmath0 sct stars from the ground .",
    "these opacity  driven pulsators show many excited modes with amplitudes that can be reached by photometry from the ground .",
    "after several results obtained by different teams performing single  site observations , the most promising targets have been monitored by means of multisite campaigns .",
    "a full description of the state  of  art in observing @xmath0 sct stars from ground can be found in breger & montgomery @xcite .",
    "the corot ( convection , rotation and planetary transits ) space mission gives us the possibility to investigate the pulsational content of @xmath0 sct stars from a totally new perspective , i.e. , high  precision measurements performed in a continuous way for tens of days ( short runs ) or more than one hundred days ( long runs ) . one of the new @xmath0 sct stars discovered in the preparatory work , hd  50844 , was among the 10 asteroseismologic targets of the initial run ( ir01 ) , started on february 2@xmath5 , 2007 and finished on march 31@xmath6 , 2007 ( @xmath7t=57.61  d ) .",
    "it is a slightly evolved star , close to the terminal age main sequence .",
    "the physical parameters derived from strmgren photometry are @xmath8=1.31 , t@xmath9=7500  k , @xmath10=3.6 , and [ fe / h]=0.4  dex @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we summarize the results obtained from the analysis of the corot data and the ground  based spectroscopy and photometry ; poretti et al . @xcite give a more detailed description of all the procedures and discussions sketched here .",
    "for the analysis , we used the reduced n2 data rebinned at 32  sec and we only considered the 140,016 datapoints for which no problem ( i.e. , flag=0 ) were reported ( fig .",
    "[ curve ] , top panel ) .",
    "the rejection of the flagged points resulted in a slight enhancement of the amplitude of the orbital frequency , since the bad measurements occurred mostly when the satellite crossed the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "the light curve was detrended with a linear fit to remove the effect of ageing @xcite .",
    "firstly , the thirty frequencies with the highest amplitudes were identified and the data were prewhitened to clearly show outliers , jumps and long  term trend ( fig .  [ curve ] , second panel ) .",
    "the final dataset is composed of 134,257 datapoints ( fig .",
    "[ curve ] , third panel ) and the subsequent prewhitening leaves a residual light curve without appreciable trend ( fig .  [ curve ] , fourth panel ) . to gain in cpu time and to reduce the noise level , in the last step we grouped the original data into new bins of four consecutive measurements , thus obtaining 32,433 datapoints ( fig .",
    "[ curve ] , bottom panel ) .    to have a reference frame for interpreting the results for hd  50844 ( a2 , @xmath11=9.09 ) , we considered the data of hd  292790 ( f8 , @xmath11=9.48 ) , which was observed by corot in the same ir01 .",
    "our frequency analysis shows that the luminosity of hd  292790 is modulated by the rotation in a simple way .",
    "the amplitude spectrum shows the rotational frequency , its harmonics and the satellite frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] , top panel ) . for most part of the spectrum , i.e. , from 10 to 100  d@xmath2",
    ", the noise level is distributed in an uniform way and is very low , namely below 0.01  mmag . for @xmath12d@xmath2 , where the modulation terms and the long term drift are concentrated ,",
    "the noise level slightly increases . on the other hand",
    ", the amplitude spectrum of hd  50844 appears to be very dense ( fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] , second panel ) . at first glance ,",
    "it is clear that the amplitude spectrum of hd  50844 is only for @xmath13d@xmath2 as flat as that of hd  292790 .",
    "we can calculate a noise amplitude of @xmath14 mag .",
    "it is straightforward to deduce that the signal is concentrated in the @xmath15d@xmath2 domain , though there is no predominant peak region after identification of 250 frequencies ( residual rms 1.2 mmag ) . at that point ,",
    "the average peak height ( 0.10  mmag ) for @xmath15d@xmath2 is still 10 times higher than for @xmath13d@xmath2 .",
    "a huge number of terms is necessary to reduce the amplitude spectrum of hd  50844 at the expected noise level .",
    "the peak height gets progressively lower after the identification of 500 , 750 , and 1000 terms ( third , fourth , and fifth panels in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] , respectively ) .",
    "it is possible that some of the lower peaks originate from changes in amplitude or phase , or from other effects intrinsic to the star . in any case",
    ", the main conclusion of our analysis and related checks is that hundreds of terms   at least up to 1000   are needed to explain the light variability of hd  50844 .",
    "the detection of so many independent terms in the light variability of a @xmath0 sct star is a totally new result .",
    "figure  [ distri ] shows the distribution of the first 100 frequencies identified in the corot timeseries .",
    "sct star : up to 1000 peaks are needed to make the residual spectrum of hd  50844 comparable to the original one of hd  292790 . ,",
    "scaledwidth=48.0% ]     is out of scale ( 15.4 mmag).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the spectroscopic observations were completed from january 2 to 28 , 2007 with the feros instrument mounted at the 2.2-m eso / mpi telescope , la silla , chile .",
    "the spectral resolution of feros is @xmath16 .",
    "we obtained 232 spectra in 14 nights .",
    "the exposure time was set to 900  sec and the signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) ranged from 150 to 210 .",
    "the spectra were reduced using an improved version of the standard feros pipeline , written in midas and developed by rainer @xcite .",
    "the mean barycentric radial velocity of the star is @xmath170.2  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we also derived a @xmath18 value of 58@xmath192  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the spectroscopic frequencies were searched for by analysing the lpvs by means of the pixel  by  pixel technique @xcite .",
    "we detected 27 terms with an snr higher than 4.0 and 3 terms with 3.1@xmath20snr@xmath203.5 .",
    "the mode identification was performed by fitting the amplitude and phase variations of each mode across the line profile @xcite by using the software famias @xcite .",
    "uncertainties are estimated to be @xmath191 for the degree @xmath3 and @xmath192 for the order @xmath21 .",
    "the main goal of the spectroscopic observations is to answer the crucial question about the huge number of frequencies detected in the corot photometric data : is the large number of photometric terms related to the visibility not only of low  degree modes but also of high  degree modes ? to investigate this we focus on the mode identification results , as derived from the high - resolution data .",
    "the highest detected degree is @xmath22 .",
    "this observational fact tells us that we have at least 235 possible modes of pulsation for a given radial order @xmath23 .",
    "a few different radial orders are sufficient for explaining the 1000 frequencies detected in the corot photometric timeseries of hd  50844 . on the other hand , we know from corot photometry that the frequency values higher than 30  d@xmath2 are observed after the 300@xmath24 rank of detection , i.e. , with very low amplitudes .",
    "the observed spectroscopic frequencies have @xmath2520  d@xmath2 . we still miss the spectroscopic counterpart of the @xmath26  d@xmath2 region .",
    "such a region could be filled by modes with high radial orders @xmath23 , which are shifted toward higher frequencies than those of the low orders .",
    "in addition to the lpv analysis , the feros spectra were used to determine the abundances of the elements .",
    "hd  50844 is a slightly metal - deficient star .",
    "however , the abundances of elements as c , n , and s in the hd  50844 atmosphere are very similar to those of the sun , while other elements are underabundant .",
    "such an abundance pattern is typical of @xmath27 boo stars @xcite .    the importance of colour information to estimate the degree @xmath3 of the modes is well - known @xcite",
    "; therefore , we observed hd  50844 in stromgren @xmath28 photometry to accompany the corot white  light photometry .",
    "several campaigns were carried out at s. pedro mrtir and sierra nevada observatories , using twin danish photometers .",
    "we calculated the amplitude ratios and the phase shifts by using the @xmath29 colour as the reference system .",
    "the immediate result is that the predominant term @xmath4=6.92  d@xmath2 is characterized by positive phase shifts ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) .",
    "the mode identification of the @xmath4 term from the spectroscopic data was not trivial since we had to take the harmonic 2@xmath4 and the equivalent width variations into account .",
    "the famias method returns two possibile @xmath31 couples , i.e. , ( 0,0 ) and ( 2,0 ) . when considering both the spectroscopic and the photometric identifications , we can consider the @xmath4 term as the fundamental radial mode",
    "the exploitation of the corot photometric timeseries of hd  50844 resulted in a very complex and intriguing task , also giving a completely new picture of the pulsational content of @xmath0 sct stars .",
    "we demonstrated that the light curve of hd  50844 can be explained by the presence of hundreds of excited terms .",
    "classical checks such as using different software packages , subdividing the timeseries into different subsets , carefully inspecting the residuals , and comparing with other similar targets observed by corot , together confirm this issue .",
    "resolution spectra support the excitation of modes having a very high degree @xmath3 ( up to @xmath3=14 ) , thus providing an observational explanation for the richness of the frequency spectrum .",
    "such a large number of modes of different @xmath3 simultaneously excited is among plausible features suggested by theoretical works .",
    "an immediate conclusion is that the cancellation effects are not sufficient in removing the variations of the flux integrated over the whole stellar disk ; daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "@xcite correctly predicted this extension to high degrees of the modes extracted from high  precision photometric timeseries .",
    "we should keep in mind that the corot performances and the continuous monitoring allow detection of amplitudes of about 10@xmath1  mag without significant aliasing effects , which is a totally new perspective .",
    "the case of hd  50844 seems to match the theoretical picture featuring a very large number of excited modes with amplitudes limited by a saturation mechanism of the @xmath32 mechanism .",
    "this confirms that the observation of @xmath0 sct stars with corot will allow us to address the longstanding problem of amplitude distribution and the potential existence of mode selection processes in the @xmath0 sct instability strip .",
    "we note that hd  50844 probably does not constitute a  standard \" scientific case of a @xmath0 sct star , because it is located on the tams , probably belongs to the class of @xmath27 boo stars ( i.e. , showing atmospheric particularities ) , and it is seen almost equator - on .",
    "nevertheless , seismic models that were able to reproduce the position of hd  50844 in the hr diagram and its measured rotational velocity were calculated .",
    "hd  50844 has for the first time disclosed the intrinsic complexity of frequency spectra of intermediate  mass stars in the lower part of the instability strip .",
    "it is quite evident that , after these first corot observations , we must look at @xmath0 sct stars in a completely new way . we have to realize that ground  based observations were only able to observe the tip of the iceberg , while the larger part of the modes have remained undetected .",
    "the feros data are being obtained as part of the eso large programme lp178.d-0361 ( pi .",
