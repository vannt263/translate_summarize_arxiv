    "the single - particle shell model with strong central and spin - orbit potentials is a cornerstone of nuclear structure physics since about sixty years .",
    "it was introduced by haxel , jensen and sue @xcite and goeppert - mayer @xcite in order to explain the experimentally observed occurrence of magic numbers for nuclei close to the valley of @xmath0-stability . in this picture , nucleons move as independent particles in a spherical mean - field .",
    "the central potential usually has a shape similar to the nuclear density distribution and the spin - orbit potential is peaked at the nuclear surface .",
    "the large spin - orbit potential explains the observed energy splittings between two spin - orbit partners with total angular momentum @xmath1 and parity @xmath2 for a given orbital angular momentum @xmath3 , see the left part of figure [ fig:01 ] .",
    "this essential feature of the model generates the particular shell structure with the appearance of major shell closures at nucleon numbers 2 , 8 , 20 , 28 , 50 , 82 , 126 ,  and subshell closures at , e.g. , 14 , 40 , 114 .",
    "the single - particle wave functions of the mean - field calculation can serve as a basis in order to construct fully antisymmetrized many - body wave functions . using a suitably chosen subset in the many - body space with an appropriate residual interaction , the excitation spectrum of a nucleus",
    "can be described with high accuracy by diagonalizing the corresponding many - body hamiltonian , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "experiments with exotic nuclei suggest a change of the well - known shell structure outside the valley of stability and the appearance of new ( sub-)shell closures often attributed to changes in the spin - orbit splitting or halo effects .",
    "it is very important to understand the evolution of the single - particle energies with a change in isospin asymmetry and to identify the origin of this effect .",
    "a change in the size of shell gaps can have important consequences in r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite . in recent years , contributions to the nucleon - nucleon potential that change the usual shell structure when",
    "the isospin asymmetry of the system increases have been discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "there are mainly two contributions to the nucleon - nucleon potential that have been considered : 1 .  a central interaction of majorana - type @xmath4 ( spin - isospin interaction ) and 2 .",
    "a non - central isospin - tensor interaction @xmath5 with the tensor operator @xmath6 , where the absolute strength of the potentials depends on the particular radial functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the monopole part of these interactions is found to be strongly attractive between protons and neutrons when the spins of the two nucleons are anti - aligned , i.e. , for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) with @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( in case of the central spin - isospin interaction one has @xmath16 ) .",
    "hence , the filling of one level with protons ( neutrons ) will lead to a strong shift of the corresponding neutron ( proton ) states changing the spin - orbit splittings and , depending on the involved levels , the size of the shell gaps .    of particular importance",
    "is the behaviour of the levels that define the conventional shell gaps .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the ( sub-)shell closures at 14 , 20 , 28 , 50 , 82 , 114 and 126 at least one level defining the gap belongs a pair of so - called pseudospin partners .",
    "these states are marked by solid circles in the central level scheme in figure [ fig:01 ] .",
    "the total and orbital angular quantum numbers of the partner states are related to the so - called pseudo orbital angular momentum @xmath17 by @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "both levels have the same parity @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , the principal quantum number @xmath23 of the state with @xmath18 is larger than the principal quantum number of the state with @xmath20 by one unit .",
    "for example , the doublets @xmath24 with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath25 , @xmath28 are pseudospin partners .",
    "the indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the spin - orbit and pseudospin representation of the states , respectively . many partner levels of pseudospin pairs are experimentally found to be almost degenerate in energy suggesting the existence of a particular symmetry in the mean - field hamiltonian for the single - particle states .",
    "this feature has been noticed already more than forty years ago and the concept of pseudospin and pseudo - orbital angular momentum was introduced @xcite .",
    "a breaking of the pseudospin symmetry in stable and exotic nuclei is potentially important for a change of the level structure and the appearance of new magic numbers .",
    "it is important to identify the contributions to the nuclear interaction that are responsible for a breaking or the restoration of the pseudospin symmetry . to this end , a quantitative measure of the pseudospin splitting",
    "is needed that can be used to compare and improve theoretical models .",
    "bohr , hamamoto and mottelson @xcite discussed a transformation of the form @xmath31 that connects the angular momentum part of the pseudospin partner levels ( see eq.([eq : sigmadotr ] ) ) .",
    "however , it can not account for the change of the principal quantum number @xmath23 .",
    "hence , a dynamical symmetry involving the momentum operator @xmath32 is required . also it was observed that the su(3 ) and pseudo - su(3 ) states of the shell model are related by transformations that are elements of the orthosymplectic superalgebra osp(1/2 ) @xcite .",
    "the many - particle pseudo - su(3 ) theory is successfully used in the description of heavy deformed nuclei in the context of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) applying supersymmetry , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "eventually , the relevant momentum helicity operator @xmath33 was identified that accomplishes the pseudospin transformation and it was noticed that the dirac equation of free or in - medium nucleons ( in the dirac - brueckner approach ) is invariant under this transformation @xcite . the essential step in explaining the pseudospin symmetry was the application of a relativistic description . in this approach , e.g. , in the form of relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models , the single - particle states are described by dirac spinor wave functions with large upper and small lower components .",
    "ginocchio observed that the second - order differential equation for the lower component is approximately invariant with respect to the pseudospin symmetry transformation in rmf models with large scalar and vector potentials of nearly equal magnitude .",
    "in addition , the radial wave functions of this lower component are almost identical for two pseudospin partner states @xcite .",
    "the pseudospin symmetry was studied in various models for nuclear structure without and with deformation and in nucleon - scattering @xcite .",
    "a symmetry breaking pseudospin - orbit potential can be derived from the wave equation of the lower component . in principle",
    ", this potential should be a measure for the strength of the symmetry breaking .",
    "it should appear as a small perturbation in comparison with the dominating central potential in a mean - field description of nuclei .",
    "however , this potential exhibits a pole at finite radii and its position depends strongly on the level energy itself .",
    "therefore , one can not really estimate the strength of the splitting and test how the choice of the various contributions to the interaction influences the symmetry restoration or breaking as observed experimentally .",
    "the problems related to this peculiarity have been discussed in the literature , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "besides the single - particle levels that constitute pseudospin pairs there are several states that are ( pseudo-)unpaired in a nucleus .",
    "there are all the @xmath34 states corresponding to @xmath35 irrespective of the principal quantum number @xmath23 and the states for given pseudospin @xmath36 with ( pseudo ) principal quantum number @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "e.g. , for the pseudoangular momentum @xmath26 the @xmath39 level has no pseudospin partner whereas for @xmath40 the pairs @xmath41 appear .",
    "see the right part of figure [ fig:01 ] .",
    "the latter feature is a typical observation for a system of levels respecting exact supersymmetry .",
    "it is therefore tempting to apply supersymmetric quantum mechanics to the nuclear single - particle shell model and to go beyond the harmonic oscillator case @xcite .",
    "as will be shown below , the approach employing supersymmetry allows to extract a pseudospin breaking potential that is regular in contrast to the standard relativistic description . from the condition of vanishing perturbation potential",
    ", general potentials can be derived that exhibit exact pseudospin symmetry . in order to compare the standard description of pseudospin symmetry with the supersymmetric approach",
    ", the relativistic hamiltonian will be used as a starting point in the theoretical considerations below . in principle , however , the supersymmetric approach can also be applied to non - relativistic hamiltonians .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : rmf ] the basic equations for describing single - particle states in relativistic models are given and the notation for quantum numbers , wave functions , potentials and hamiltonians is established .",
    "the conventional description of pseudospin symmetry in the relativistic approach is discussed in section [ sec : ps ] and a simple example is introduced that will accompany the following theoretical presentation . in section [ sec : susy ] , first the concept of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is presented as far as necessary to solve the problem considered here .",
    "more detailed accounts can be found , e.g. , in refs .",
    "then the supermomenta and supersymmetric partner hamiltonians are defined .",
    "the form of the reduced supermomenta at small radii leads to a particular choice of energy shifts that relate the pseudospin partner hamiltonians of the relativistic upper component wave functions to the partner hamiltonians in the supersymmetric approach .",
    "then , the connection between the wave functions in the standard relativistic and the supersymmetric description is given .",
    "a regular symmetry breaking potential is derived that quantifies the pseudospin splitting .",
    "it can be used in the future to compare and improve nuclear structure calculations . in the final subsection ,",
    "general potentials in relativistic hamiltonians with exact pseudospin symmetry are discussed .",
    "the last section contains conclusions and an outlook .",
    "the motion of the nucleons in rmf models is governed by strong scalar and vector potentials ( or self - energies ) originating from the minimal coupling of scalar and vector mesons to the nucleons .",
    "in addition , a tensor potential can appear if vector mesons are coupled non - minimally to the meson field tensors , i.e.  by a derivative coupling .",
    "in general , there are both isoscalar and isovector contributions to the nucleon self - energies .",
    "the details of the particular rmf model are not important in the present discussion .",
    "see , e.g. , references @xcite for a more extensive presentation . here , it suffices to consider only the calculation of the single - particle states for given scalar , vector and tensor potentials in the dirac equation .    in the following spherical symmetry will be assumed . in this case , single - particle levels are characterized by the principal quantum number @xmath42 , the orbital angular momentum @xmath43 , the parity @xmath44 , the total angular momentum @xmath45 , and its projection @xmath46 . in the relativistic description",

    "the upper and lower component in ( [ eq : psi_dirac ] ) have an opposite sign for the quantum number @xmath52 in the spinor spherical harmonics and consequently opposite parity with a difference of one in the orbital angular momentum . by applying the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_dirac ] ) to the dirac spinor ( [ eq : psi_dirac ] ) and using the relations @xmath74 and @xmath75 the set of coupled first - order differential equations @xmath76 for the radial wave functions is obtained .",

    "it is always positive in standard rmf models .",
    "the dependence on the energy @xmath54 is a relativistic effect .",
    "since @xmath54 contains the rest mass @xmath55 of the nucleon , the variation of @xmath86 with a change in the nucleon binding energy is very small . for vanishing scalar and vector fields @xmath60 and @xmath61 at large radii @xmath80",
    ", @xmath88 reduces to the non - relativistic energy @xmath89 of the bound nucleon .",

    "the spin - orbit potential contains contributions from the tensor potential @xmath95 and the derivative of the sum @xmath96 whereas the main contribution to the central potential arises from the difference @xmath97 . with the typical strong vector and scalar potentials of almost similar magnitude inside nuclei , the usual depth of the central potential and the strong surface - peaked spin - orbit potential",
    "are nicely explained in the relativistic approach .",
    "a tensor potential is usually omitted in traditional rmf calculations but it has a distinct effect on the spin - orbit splitting that can be relevant for the size of the shell gaps .",
    "the basic idea in the relativistic description of pseudospin symmetry is a comparison of the hamiltonians @xmath85 , @xmath98 and of the radial wave functions @xmath99 , @xmath100 for the two pseudospin partner levels of the doublet @xmath101 .",

    "there is a clear difference in the radial dependence of the upper component wave functions at small @xmath80 .",
    "but for the lower component radial wave function the @xmath80 dependence is very similar .",

    "the difference between the potentials @xmath139 could be considered as a measure for the pseudospin splitting because for @xmath140 the hamiltonians @xmath85 and @xmath133 are identical and yield the same energy eigenvalues",
    ".    however , there is a problem in this approach since the quantity @xmath88 has a zero at finite @xmath80 inside the nucleus with usual scalar and vector potentials in rmf models .",

    "they are identical at a certain radius @xmath80 and the quantity ( [ eq : defb ] ) is zero .",
    "consequently , the difference potential ( [ eq : delta1 ] ) , shown as a red solid line in figure [ fig:03 ] , has a pole .",
    "its position is strongly energy dependent .",
    "thus , @xmath143 can not be considered small as compared to the potential @xmath97 in the differential equation and it is therefore not a good measure for the symmetry breaking .    for vanishing tensor potential @xmath144 ,",
    "the pseudospin - orbit potential ( [ eq : delta1 ] ) is zero for @xmath145 or @xmath146 with a constant @xmath147 . as a consequence of this condition ,",
    "the main contribution @xmath97 to the central potential ( [ eq : vc ] ) is just an overall shift of the energy scale for exact pseudospin symmetry .",
    "but then there will be no sufficiently strong central potential to bind the states as required in a nucleus .",
    "a case where exact pseudospin symmetry is found is the relativistic harmonic oscillator with @xmath148 and @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "the effective mass @xmath149 is a constant , @xmath150 but @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "hence , the identification of @xmath153 as the relevant quantity to measure the pseudospin splitting is doubtful",
    ". it would be convenient to have an independent measure of the symmetry breaking that has a regular behaviour for all radii and that vanishes for exact pseudospin symmetry .",
    "the problems related to the conventional relativistic explanation of pseudospin symmetry call for an alternative approach that allows to derive a regular symmetry breaking potential which is a small perturbation without a pole and useful for a quantitative comparison of different models .",
    "the main idea of the supersymmetric approach to describe the pseudospin symmetry in nuclei is similar to the standard relativistic description . in both cases",
    "one does not compare the original model hamiltonians of the pseudospin partner systems but closely related hamilton operators with the same spectra .",
    "in fact , it will be shown below that a comparison of the supersymmetric partner hamiltonians provides a way to define a proper pseudospin splitting potential .",
    "these partner potentials are derived from the hamiltonians @xmath84 and @xmath132 for the upper component wave functions of the pseudospin partners @xmath52 and @xmath103 , respectively . to this end",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hf2 ] ) is written as @xmath154 with a hamiltonian @xmath155 of a supersymmetric pair and an energy shift @xmath156 to be determined below .",
    "a corresponding relation holds for the pseudospin partner hamiltonian @xmath132 .",
    "it is well known , that every second - order hamiltonian can be factorized in a product of two hermitian conjugate first - order operators @xcite . in the present case ,",

    "the occurrence of almost degenerate pseudospin partner levels in atomic nuclei is usually attributed to a symmetry of the underlying relativistic hamiltonian as it appears , e.g. , in rmf models .",

    "the supermomenta itself are determined via a riccati equation by the scalar , vector and tensor potentials in the relativistic hamiltonian .",
    "a simple example shows that the reduced supermomenta of pseudospin partner states are very similar rising approximately linear at small radii as in the case of the harmonic oscillator .",

    "of special importance is the tensor interaction ( neglected in most rmf models ) that affects both the spin - orbit and the pseudospin - orbit splitting .",
    "the method that is developed in this paper is not restricted to a relativistic description of the single - particle states . in principle , it can also be applied to the usual schrdinger equation for the single - particle wave functions as it appears , e.g. , in the skyrme hartree - fock method , because it relies only on the schrdinger - equivalent differential equation of the upper component in the dirac spinor . instead of the scalar ,",
    "vector and tensor potentials in the relativistic hamiltonian , there are also at least three independent quantities that characterize the mean - field in the non - relativistic hamiltonian : the position depending effective mass , the central and the spin - orbit potential .",
