    "<S> studies of an interesting effect of neutrino spin and spin - flavour oscillations engenders by neutrino weak interactions with the transversally moving or polarized matter are reviewed .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that massive neutrinos have nontrivial electromagnetic properties , and at least the magnetic moment is not zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , neutrinos do participate also in the electromagnetic interaction ( see @xcite for a review ) . </S>",
    "<S> the best terrestrial laboratory upper bound on neutrino magnetic moments is obtained by the gemma reactor neutrino experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the best astrophysical upper bound was derived from considering stars cooling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino magnetic moment procession in the transversal magnetic field @xmath0 was first considered in @xcite , then spin - flavor precession in vacuum was discussed in @xcite , the importance of the matter effect was emphasized in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of resonant amplification of neutrino spin oscillations in @xmath0 in the presence of matter was proposed in @xcite , the impact of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath1 was discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently we consider in details @xcite neutrino mixing and oscillations in arbitrary constant magnetic field that have @xmath0 and @xmath1 nonzero components in mass and flavour bases . </S>",
    "<S> we have also developed a new ( and more precise than the usual one ) approach to description of neutrino spin and spin - flavor oscillations in the presence of an arbitrary magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the use of the stationary states in the magnetic field for classification of neutrino spin states , contrary to the customary approach when the neutrino helicity states are used for this purpose .    in this short note </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a very interesting effect in neutrino spin and spin - flavour oscillations in presence of matter background that was first discussed in our paper @xcite . in our studies </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that neutrino spin and spin - flavour oscillations can be induced not only by the neutrino interaction with a magnetic field , as it was believed before , but also by neutrino interactions with matter in the case when there is a transversal matter current or matter polarization . in the conclusions of @xcite one finds :    _  the possible emergence of neutrino spin oscillations owing to neutrino interaction with matter under the condition that there exists a nonzero transverse current component or matter polarization is the most important new effect that follows from the investigation of neutrino - spin oscillations in section 4 . </S>",
    "<S> so far , it has been assumed that neutrino - spin oscillations may arise only in the case where there exists a nonzero transverse magnetic field in the neutrino rest frame . \" _    it should be noted that the predicted effect exist regardless of a source of the background matter transversal current or polarization ( that can be a background magnetic field , for instance ) .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the existence of the discussed effect of neutrino spin oscillations engendered by the transversal matter current and matter polarization and its importance for astrophysical applications have been confirmed in a series of recent papers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider , as an example , an electron neutrino spin procession in the case when neutrinos with the standard model interaction are propagating through moving and polarized matter composed of electrons ( electron gas ) in the presence of an electromagnetic field given by the electromagnetic - field tensor @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the generalized bargmann - michel - telegdi equation describes the evolution of the three - dimensional neutrino spin vector @xmath3 , @xmath4,\\ ] ] where the magnetic field @xmath5 in the neutrino rest frame is determined by the transversal and longitudinal ( with respect to the neutrino motion ) magnetic and electric field components in the laboratory frame , @xmath6\\big),\\ ] ] @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the neutrino velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> the matter term @xmath9 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s ] ) is also composed of the transversal @xmath10 and longitudinal @xmath11 parts , @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the invariant number density of matter given in the reference frame for which the total speed of matter is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the vectors @xmath16 , and @xmath17 denote , respectively , the speed of the reference frame in which the mean momentum of matter ( electrons ) is zero , and the mean value of the polarization vector of the background electrons in the above mentioned reference frame . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath18 calculated within the extended standard model supplied with @xmath19-singlet right - handed neutrino @xmath20 are respectively , @xmath21 , where @xmath22    for neutrino evolution between two neutrino states @xmath23 in presence of the magnetic field and moving matter we get @xcite the following equation @xmath24 thus , the probability of the neutrino spin oscillations in the adiabatic approximation is given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath25 where @xmath26    thus , it follows that even without presence of an electromagnetic field , @xmath27 , neutrino spin oscillations can be induced in the presence of matter when the transverse matter term @xmath28 is not zero . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is realized in the case when the transverse component of the background matter velocity or its transverse polarization is not zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the above considerations can be applied to other types of neutrinos and various matter compositions . </S>",
    "<S> it is also obvious that for neutrinos with nonzero transition magnetic moments a similar effect of spin - flavour oscillations exists under the same background conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of neutrino spin procession and oscillations induced by the transversal matter current or polarization was first discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more general case of neutrino spin evolution in the case when neutrino is subjected to general types of non - derative interactions with external scalar @xmath29 , pseoudoscalar @xmath30 , vector @xmath31 , axial - vector @xmath32 , tensor @xmath33 and pseudotensor @xmath34 fields was considered in @xcite . from the obtained general neutrino spin evolution equation it follows that neither scalar @xmath29 nor pseudoscalar @xmath30 nor vector @xmath31 fields can induce neutrino spin evolution . on the contrary , within the general consideration of neutrino spin evolution </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that electromagnetic ( tensor ) and weak ( axial - vector ) interactions can contribute to the neutrino spin evolution .    </S>",
