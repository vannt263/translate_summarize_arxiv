    "there is no doubt that the interest of the scientific community in the stabilization and control of systems of partial differential equations has remarkably increased , in recent years .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that such systems arise in several applied mathematical models , such as those used for studying the vibrations of flexible structures and networks ( see @xcite and references therein ) , or fluids and fluid - structure interactions ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    when dealing with systems involving quantities described by several components , pretending to control or observe all the state variables might be irrealistic . in applications to mathematical models for the vibrations of flexible structures ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , electromagnetism ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , or fluid control ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , it may happen that only part of such components can be observed .",
    "this is why it becomes essential to study whether controlling only a reduced number of state variables suffices to ensure the stability of the full system .",
    "it turns out that certain systems possess an internal structure that compensates for the aforementioned lack of control variables .",
    "such a phenomenon is referred to as _ indirect stabilization _ or _ indirect control _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an example of indirect stabilization occurs with the hyperbolic system @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a bounded open domain of @xmath2 , and the ` frictional ' term @xmath3 acts as a stabilizer .",
    "indeed , a general result proved in @xcite ensures that , for sufficiently smooth initial conditions and @xmath4 small enough , the energy of the solution @xmath5 of decays to zero at a polynomial rate as @xmath6 .",
    "the above indirect stabilization property holds true for more general systems of partial differential equations , under the compatibility assumption below , see @xcite . for applications to problems in mechanical engineering , however , it is extremely important to consider also boundary conditions that fail to satisfy the assumption of @xcite .",
    "this is the case of neumann or robin boundary conditions , which describe different physical situations such as hinged or clamped devices .",
    "for instance , let us change the boundary conditions in as follows : @xmath7 then , as is shown in proposition [ compcondns ] below , the compatibility assumption is not satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we will prove polynomial stability for system , using a new hypothesis which is specially designed to handle boundary conditions as above  that we call _ hybrid_.    more generally , in a real hilbert space @xmath8 , with scalar product @xmath9 and norm",
    "@xmath10 , we shall study the system of evolution equations @xmath11 where    1 .",
    "@xmath12 are densely defined closed linear operators such that @xmath13 for some @xmath14 , 2 .",
    "@xmath15 is a bounded linear operator on @xmath8 such that @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , 3 .",
    "@xmath18 is a real number such that @xmath19    system ( [ eq:1z ] ) , with the initial conditions @xmath20 can be formulated as a cauchy problem for a certain first order evolution equation in the product space @xmath21 more precisely , let us define the energies associated to operators @xmath22 by @xmath23 and the total energy of the system as @xmath24 for every @xmath25 .",
    "then , assumption ( h1 ) yields , for @xmath26 , @xmath27 moreover , in view of @xmath28 , for all @xmath29 @xmath30\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 .",
    "let us introduce the bilinear form on @xmath32 @xmath33 since @xmath34 thanks to the above form is a scalar product on @xmath32 , and @xmath32 is a hilbert space with such a product .",
    "let now @xmath35 be the operator defined by @xmath36 then , problem ( [ eq:1z ] ) takes the equivalent form @xmath37 as will be proved in lemma  [ leminvtdiopa ] , @xmath38 is a maximal dissipative operator .",
    "then , from classical results ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , it follows that @xmath38 generates a @xmath39-semigroup , @xmath40 , on @xmath32 .",
    "also , @xmath41 where @xmath5 is the solution of problem ( [ eq:1z])-([eq : icz ] ) , and @xmath42 .    in order to introduce our asymptotic analysis of system -or , equivalently ,",
    "let us observe that , as is explained in @xcite , no exponential stability can be expected .",
    "therefore , weaker decay rates at infinity , such as polynomial ones , are to be sought for .",
    "polynomial decay results for were obtained in @xcite assuming that , for some integer @xmath43 , @xmath44 similar decay estimates for the case of boundary damping ( that is , when operator @xmath15 is unbounded ) were derived in @xcite .",
    "also , we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for indirect stabilization with localized damping , and to @xcite for the study of a one - dimensional wave system coupled through velocities .    the asymptotic behavior of wave - like equations and , in particular , the derivation of optimal decay rates for the energy when the geometry of the domain and damping region allow rays to be trapped , have been intensively studied for several decades . for such questions and results ,",
    "we refer the reader to lebeau  @xcite and burq  @xcite ( and the references therein ) . in  @xcite , lebeau considered a locally damped wave equation and proved optimal logarithmic decay rates for the energy , provided that damping is active on a nonempty open set .",
    "the proof relies on optimal resolvent estimates for the corresponding infinitesimal generator of the associated semigroup . later on these results were completed by burq in  @xcite in exterior domains , in particular for cases in which rays may be trapped by the obstacle .",
    "independently , indirect stabilization for symmetric hyperbolic systems was first considered by the first author in  @xcite , and further developed in  @xcite , using energy type methods , together with some new ideas such as the new integral inequality given in theorem  [ theorem1.1 ] ( see  @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "the purpose is rather to focus on the properties of the data  that is , the operators @xmath45 and the coupling operator  that allow to transfer the damping action of the feedback to the undamped equation .",
    "subsequently , indirect stabilization of coupled systems was investigated in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "resolvent estimates were obtained and spectral analysis was used to prove polynomial decay for , covering some of the examples treated in @xcite . in  @xcite , where a riesz basis approach is followed , polynomial decay rates for the energy were derived for a simplified case of coupled system , where operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 are supposed to be equal ( to @xmath48 ) and the damping operator is a nonpositive fractional power of @xmath48 .",
    "more recently , inspired by @xcite and @xcite , and , through @xcite , by @xcite , the optimality of spectral - analysis - derived decay rates was shown in @xcite and @xcite , taking into account the asymptotic behaviour of the resolvent on the imaginary axis .    in the context of indirect stabilization for coupled systems",
    ", we would like to stress the fact that checking the assumptions on the data@xmath49 and the coupling operator  that are needed to ensure decay , may be a difficult task .",
    "in particular , resolvent estimates may be hard to obtain when @xmath46 and @xmath47 do not commute , or damping and coupling operators do not commute with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for results in this direction",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "the case of localized or boundary damping , together with localized coupling , is analyzed in @xcite , where @xmath50 , but @xmath15 and the coupling operator do not commute with @xmath48 . moreover , since coupling is localized , the corresponding operator is no longer coercive .",
    "this fact generates additional difficulties .    in this paper",
    ", we will replace by @xmath51 which is satisfied by a large class of systems including as a special case ( see section  [ se : applications ] below ) .",
    "under such a condition we will show that any solution @xmath52 of satisfies the integral inequality @xmath53 moreover , since the energy of solutions is decreasing in time , implies , in turn , the polynomial decay of order @xmath54 of @xmath55 , that is , @xmath56 for all @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( see corollary  [ co : main1 ] below ) .",
    "notice that yields , in particular , the strong stability of @xmath59 .",
    "the compatibility condition   is equivalent to the boundedness of @xmath60 .",
    "let us point out that this hypothesis is sufficient but not necessary .",
    "such a fact can be observed taking , for example , @xmath61 with @xmath62 . in this case",
    ", condition is violated , but it is easy to check that condition   holds for the smallest integer @xmath63 such that @xmath64 . on the other hand , condition is satisfied for all @xmath65 .",
    "this example shows that the present results and those of  @xcite are in some sense complementary and , for @xmath61,(@xmath66 ) exactly complementary .",
    "one should also note that , for general operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the two compatibility conditions and do not cover all possible cases .",
    "passing from polynomial to a general power - like decay estimate is quite natural , once has been established . indeed , in section [ se : intres ] , using _",
    "interpolation theory _",
    ", we obtain the fractional decay rate @xmath67 for all @xmath57 and @xmath68 ( see corollary [ th : main * ] below ) .",
    "moreover , taking initial data in @xmath69 for any @xmath70 , we deduce the continuous decay rate @xmath71 notice that a somewhat comparable result is obtained in   using a different technique .",
    "in particular , for @xmath72 , implies that , for every @xmath73 the solution @xmath52 of problem ( [ eq:2z ] ) satisfies @xmath74 and there exists @xmath75 such that @xmath76    thus , interpolation theory applied to systems satisfying allows to prove continuous energy decay rates , together with decay rates under explicit smoothness conditions on the initial data .",
    "furthermore , we would like to point out that it also yields stronger results in the framework studied in @xcite , that is , under condition .",
    "we describe such applications in section [ impr ] , where we show how to deduce power - like decay rates from the energy estimates of @xcite , thus recovering , in a more general set - up , related asymptotic estimates that can be obtained by spectral analysis .",
    "let us now mention some open questions .",
    "one interesting problem is to derive optimal decay rates for the energy of an indirectly damped coupled system in geometric situations for which trapped rays may exist for the uncoupled damped equation .",
    "more precisely , it would be very interesting to generalize lebeau s resolvent analysis in @xcite to such coupled systems obtaining optimal energy estimates . in a somewhat different spirit",
    ", another open question would be to determine if it is possible to combine the results of @xcite and @xcite with the techniques developed in  @xcite in order to derive sharp upper decay rates for the energy .",
    "in all the examples we discuss in the present work  as well as in @xcite ",
    "operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 happen to have compact resolvents",
    ". it would be very interesting to see if explicit energy decay rates can be derived in different situations .",
    "for instance , it would be nice to extend burq s approach  @xcite in order to obtain indirect damping of coupled systems in exterior domains , and prove decay of the local total energy of solutions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ se : preliminaries ] recalls preliminary notions , mainly related to interpolation theory which is so relevant for most of this paper .",
    "section [ se : main ] is devoted to our polynomial decay result and its proof . in section [ se :",
    "intres ] , we complete the analysis with estimates in interpolation spaces . in section [ se : applications ] , we describe several applications to systems of partial differential operators .",
    "finally , in section [ impr ] , we show how to improve the results of @xcite by interpolation .",
