    "most remarkable observational discoveries in type - ia supernovae ( sn iae ) prevail that the universe has confirmed by two dark components containing dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "de , an unknown energy with large negative pressure , is utilized to explain the present cosmic accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "the simplest candidate for de is einstein s cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) which is equivalent to the vacuum energy density in the universe and produces negative pressure with equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath3 since it fits the observational data well , but it suffers two well - known problems , i.e. , `` fine tuning problem '' and  cosmic coincidence problem \" .",
    "+ recently , considerable interest has been stimulated in explaining the observed de by the holographic dark energy ( hde ) model .",
    "it is well known that the holographic principle is an emergent result of the recent studies for exploring the quantum gravity @xcite . according to the holographic principle , the entropy of a system scales not with its volume , but with its surface area @xcite .",
    "the hde was first proposed in @xcite following the line of @xcite where the infrared cut - off is taken to be the size of event horizon for de .",
    "@xcite purposed that the de should obey this principle , thus its energy density has an upper limit and the fin - tuning problem for the cosmological constant is omitted .",
    "its framework is the black hole thermodynamics @xcite and the correspondence of the uv cut - of of a quantum field theory , which gives rise to the vacuum energy , with the distance of the theory @xcite .",
    "li @xcite and hsu @xcite formulated the acquired vacuum energy as hde i.e. @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a numerical constant and @xmath6 is the infrared cutoff .",
    "if in a cosmological context we saturate this inequality by doing @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the hubble parameter , we obtain a model of holographic nature for the density of de .",
    "@xcite was presented a generalized and restored hde in the braneworld context .",
    "the holographic phantom energy density grows rapidly and dominates the late time expanding phase , helping realize a cyclic universe scenario in ref .",
    "another plan to explore the nature of de , dubbed agegraphic de ( ade ) , has been proposed @xcite which explain the acceleration of the universe expansion with the gravitational effect in general relativity . in the ade models the age of the universe",
    "is taken the length measure instead of the horizon distance , so the causality problem that appears in the hde model can be avoided @xcite . after introducing the ade model by cai @xcite , a new model of agegraphic de ( nade ) was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the time scale is chosen to be the conformal time @xmath9 instead of the age of the universe i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "the ade undergo from the difficulty to characterize the matter dominated era @xcite while the nade resolved this subject @xcite .",
    "many authors did some detailed study of this nade model @xcite . + a bianchi type i ( bi ) universe ,",
    "being the straightforward generalization of the flat frw universe , is of interest because it is one of the simplest models of a non - isotropic universe exhibiting a homogeneity and spatial flatness . in this case , unlike the frw universe which has the same scale factor for three spatial directions , a bi universe has a different scale factor for each direction .",
    "this fact introduce a non - isotropy to the system .",
    "the possible effects of anisotropy in the early universe have been investigated with bi models from different points of view @xcite .",
    "therefore , we establish a correspondence between the interacting holographic and new agegraphic de scalar field in an anisotropic universe .",
    "+ the organisation of this work is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "a brief review of the general formulation of the field equations in a bi metric are discussed , then , interacting de with cold dm ( cdm ) in a non - isotropic bi universe is studied . the sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] is concerned with interacting hde with the quintessence , tachyon and k - essence scalar field in an anisotropic universe .",
    "[ sec4 ] , is related to establish the correspondence between the model of interacting nade and the quintessence , tachyon and k - essence de in bi model . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we study effects of anisotropy on the @xmath0 data , sl test , the statefinder diagnostic , the linear evolution of perturbations and distance modulus with both hde and nade models and compares it with the @xmath1cdm , @xmath2cdm and frw models . at last the sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "bianchi cosmologies are spatially homogeneous but not necessarily isotropic . here",
    "we will consider bi cosmology .",
    "the metric of this model is given by @xmath11 where the metric functions , @xmath12 , are merely functions of time , @xmath13 .",
    "however , the underlying lie algebra of the isometry group of the bi metrics is completely different @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the interaction with the matter fields is given by the energy momentum tensor , which is defined as @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the energy density and eos parameter , respectively .",
    "the field equations for the axially symmetric bi metric are @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the planck mass , the energy density and pressure of de , respectively , and @xmath21 is the scale factor , and @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is the shear tensor @xmath24 , which describes the rate of distortion of the matter flow , and @xmath25 is the scalar expansion , where @xmath26 is 4-velocity . in a comoving coordinate system ,",
    "i.e. @xmath27 . from the metric eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , and considering the comoving frame , we find that the components of the average hubble parameter and the shear tensor are given by @xmath28 by using eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) , the dimensionless density parameter of bi can also be defined as usual @xmath29 where the critical energy density is @xmath30 .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) , we can rewrite ( [ 12 ] ) in the form of fractional energy densities as @xmath31 the above equation shows that the sum of the energy density parameters approaches 1 at late times .",
    "so at late times the universe becomes flat .",
    "therefore for sufficiently large time , this model predicts that the anisotropy of the universe will damp out and universe will become isotropic .",
    "this result also shows that in the early universe i.e. during the radiation and matter dominated era the universe was anisotropic and the universe approaches to isotropy as de starts to dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "when isotropic is assumed , @xmath32 , and the model has only one free parameter , @xmath33 .",
    "we shall take that the shear scalar can be described based on the average hubble parameter , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "so , eq . (",
    "[ 17 ] ) lead to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "we assume that the de is coupled with dm , in such way that total energy - momentum is still conserved . in the flat bi cosmology with a scale factor @xmath38 ,",
    "the continuity equations for both components are @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the eos parameter of the interacting de and @xmath41 is the interaction term .",
    "the case @xmath42 corresponds to either de transformation into dm and vice versa of the model .",
    "following @xcite , we shall assume @xmath43 with the coupling constant @xmath44 .",
    "in the following , we will find a form for the function @xmath45 , which is able to reconstruct hde and nade models as following .",
    "first we will consider the size @xmath6 as the hubble radius @xmath46 , thus the energy density for the de becomes @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant .",
    "as it is well known , different possibilities have been tried to varying degrees of success , namely , the particle horizon @xcite , the future event horizon @xcite and the hubble horizon @xcite .",
    "hence , we set the hubble radius as the infrared cutoff @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the problem of taking hubble radius , the de results as pressureless , since @xmath49 scales like matter energy density @xmath50 with the scale factor @xmath38 as @xmath51 , therefore producing a decelerated expansion . at this point",
    "our system of equations is not closed and we still have freedom to choose . in order to accelerate the universe more , we have added the interaction as well as anisotropy , as it can be seen in equation ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "this is a new model to explore the physical mechanism responsible for the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "therefor in the present work , we have tried to compensate the effects , ( due to the hubble s first radius that lead to a deceleration of the universe ) using interaction and anisotropy . for @xmath52 and this result is consistent with the refs .",
    "now by taking the time derivative of relation ( [ 21 ] ) and using the bi equation we find @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the energy density ratio .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) into ( [ 18 ] ) , the eos parameter for interaction hde is given by @xmath55 this relation shows that the eos parameter is depend on @xmath44 , @xmath5 and @xmath37 parameter .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 becomes a constant . in the absence of interaction between hde and cdm , @xmath57 we have @xmath58 , which is that matter dominant .",
    "it may be pointed out here that if one sets @xmath59 , eq .",

    "+ now , we intend to categorize our study into three types of the model , i.e. quintessence , tachyon and k - essence models in non - isotropic universe .",

    "it clear that an accelerated universe @xmath74 can be obtained when @xmath75 .",
    "the tachyon model , originated from the string theory , has been suggested to explain de scenario .",
    "it has an interesting feature that a rolling tachyon interpolates the eos parameter between @xmath76 to @xmath77 . also , the tachyon model is the best candidate for inflation at high energy . in a flat bi background",

    "hence , by equating ( [ 25 ] ) with ( [ 39 ] ) , i.e. @xmath80 , which gives @xmath81 integrating of eq . ( [ 32 ] ) and using ( [ 41 ] ) we obtain tachyon potential in term of the scalar field @xmath82 in this case the evolution of the tachyon is as @xmath83 .",
