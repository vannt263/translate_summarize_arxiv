    "the structural ferroelastic transitions are accompanied by elastic softening,@xcite and the same is true for most ferroelectric ( fe),@xcite magnetic and electronic transitions whose order parameter is coupled to strain.@xcite the softening starts in the high temperature phase when approaching the transition temperature , and can be directly or indirectly associated with a soft mode , or precursor fluctuations . in the low temperature phase , the elastic constants generally partially or completely restiffen , partly due to the freezing of the fluctuations , or even become much stiffer than in the high temperature phase , as in systems where a charge disproportionation and/or charge ordering transitions freezes the dynamic jahn - teller fluctuations.@xcite the fe and antiferroelectric ( afe ) transitions are also ferroelastic and therefore are accompanied by sizeable softening , but the shape of the compliance curves versus temperature strongly depends on the material and also on the measurement frequency and technique .",
    "an additional extrinsic softening mechanism in the fe state , especially important at the lowest frequencies , is the motion of the domain walls.@xcite    it is argued that the main intrinsic contribution to the softening within the fe phase is of electrostrictive and hence piezoelectric origin , but can be completely canceled by the so - called piezoelectric stiffening when the electric depolarization fields accompanying the piezoelectric charge can fully develop . as examples where these phenomena are particularly evident , we present new dielectric and elastic measurements on zr - rich pzt , where the fe phase can be turned into afe by cooling or doping with la , and compare existing low frequency@xcite and brillouin scattering@xcite experiments on pzt at the morphotropic phase boundary between the rhombohedral and tetragonal fe phases .",

    "when looked from high temperature , both permittivity curves show the curie - weiss rise up to @xmath22 , followed by a drop due to the first order nature of the fe and ic - afe transition , and an additional decrease below @xmath23 , where the susceptibility in a fully ordered afe state is quite reduced with respect to a fe or ic state .",
    "while there is no qualitative difference between the @xmath20 curves of the sample with intermediate r - fe and ic - afe phases , the difference is outstanding in the @xmath15 curves : the fe phase has an additional roughly constant softening , indicated as a hatched area , completely missing in the ic - afe phase , so that the step at @xmath23 is even inverted in sign .",
    "the piezoelectric softening is not generally known with this name and is not always evident as such in the curves of the elastic compliance or modulus versus temperature .",
    "in fact , it may be masked by precursor and fluctuation effects near the transition , by the domain wall motion , or the occurrence of other transitions at lower temperature .",

    "the expression of the softening becomes far more complicated than eq .",

    "the piezoelectrically softened elastic constant @xmath104 is considered the reference , and expressions are provided for the restiffened constants @xmath105 @xmath106 felt by a plane wave propagating along the direction @xmath107@xcite @xmath108where the relationship between piezoelectric stress and strain coefficients is@xcite @xmath109 .",

    "figure [ fig_res - bs ] presents an example where the clear piezoelectric softening measured at low frequency on a ceramic pzt sample is totally absent in the brillouin scattering experiment . at the pzt 55/45 composition one crosses at @xmath112 the morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) between r and tetragonal ( t ) fe phases , and further below @xmath113 the oxygen octahedra undergo long range tilting about the polar axis , which is a non polar mode .",
    "accordingly , the compliance measured at @xmath114  khz@xcite with the same method as described here has a large jump below @xmath25 , where the hatched region is considered piezoelectric softening , and is followed by a peak at @xmath112 . as discussed elsewhere,@xcite this peak is due to an enhancement of the shear compliance @xmath115 , that is approximately linearly coupled to the rotation of the polarization between the t @xmath116 $ ] and the r @xmath117 $ ] axis . since this @xmath115",
    "is directly related to the fe state , it contributes to the piezoelectric coupling@xcite and is totally considered piezoelectric softening . instead",
    ", the step below @xmath118 is not considered piezoelectric softening , because it is due to the antiferrodistortive octahedral tilting , which does not directly contribute to the polarization state .",

    "( [ cs - ss ] ) .",
    "therefore , the piezoelectric softening is totally absent , including the enhancement at @xmath112 related to @xmath124 .",
    "on the other hand , the peaked softening due to the short range polar fluctuations near @xmath125 is clearly visible , because their correlation lengths are shorter than the brillouin wavelength and there is no coherent depolarization field within a half wavelength .",
    "also the the step below @xmath126 is fully visible , because it does not involve piezoelectricity .",
    "the smallness of the softening in the brillouin experiments compared to those at lower frequency has been noticed also for other fe materials , and explained in terms of dynamic response of the order parameter and domain wall motion@xcite , but besides relaxation and adiabatic versus isothermal effects , the piezoelectric stiffening from the depolarization field should also be taken into account .",
    "it is shown that , regardless of the possibly complicated phase diagram , within a fe phase the elastic constants undergo a softening due to the additional piezoelectric strain under the application of the probing stress . such a strain can be reduced or canceled by the development of the depolarization field @xmath89 due to the piezoelectric charges , through the well known mechanism of the piezoelectric stiffening , which therefore restores the bare elastic constants of the paraelectric phase .",
    "the full piezoelectric softening can be observed in resonant and subresonant measurements of unpoled ceramic samples , where no coherent macroscopic @xmath89 can develop , or also of poled samples where @xmath89 is shorted by an external circuit . instead , in brillouin scattering experiments , where the wavelength of the probed acoustic waves is smaller than the domain size , a coherent @xmath127 forms within each half wavelength and cancels the piezoelectric softening .",
    "it follows that the compliance curves versus temperature of unpoled ceramic samples indirectly probe the piezoelectric coupling , and for example allow to distinguish fe from afe phases and to identify temperature and composition regions of particularly high piezoelectricity .",
    "two experimental verifications are presented .",
    "elasticity and dielectric measurements are carried out in pzt compositions where the fe phase turns into afe by cooling or doping with la , with concomitant restiffening .",
    "in addition , for pzt 55/45 a comparison is discussed of the fully piezoelectrically softened young s modulus with the unsoftened @xmath123 elastic constant from the brillouin scattering experiments of kojima and coworkers.@xcite    the authors thank p.m. latino ( cnr - isc ) for his technical assistance in the realization of the anelastic experiments and c. capiani ( cnr - istec ) for the skillful preparation of the samples .",
