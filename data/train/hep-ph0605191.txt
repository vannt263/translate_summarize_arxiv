    ", one interprets the isovector and isotriplet resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the ground - state quark - antiquark bound states .",
    "the three isoscalar resonances @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are a mixture of two isoscalar quarkonia and bare glueball configurations ( we refer to amslerrev , closerev , close95,weing , gutsche , closekirk , giacosa , giacosachiral and refs . therein ) . as a consequence , the scalar states below 1 gev ( @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 )",
    "must be something else , like ( loosely bound ) mesonic molecular states @xcite or jaffe s tetraquark states @xcite . in this work",
    "we explore by means of an effective approach the phenomenological implications of jaffe s states , whose building blocks are a diquark ( @xmath9 ) and an antidiquark ( @xmath10 ) ; calculations based on one - gluon exchange support a strong attraction among two quarks in a color antitriplet ( @xmath11 ) , a flavor antitriplet ( @xmath12 ) and spinless configuration @xcite ( color and flavor triplets are realized for an antidiquark ) .",
    "naively speaking , a diquark ` behaves like an antiquark ' from a flavor ( and color ) point of view @xcite:@xmath13\\leftrightarrow \\overline{s},\\text { } [ u , s]\\leftrightarrow   \\overline{d},\\text { } [ d , s]\\leftrightarrow \\overline{u},\\]]therefore out of a diquark and an antidiquark one can build a full scalar nonet , whose most appealing property is the reversed mass - order , thus explaining the ( almost ) degeneracy of the isoscalar state @xmath7 ( whose dominant contribution is the tetraquark structure @xmath14 ) and the isovector @xmath8 ( the neutral one interpreted as @xmath15 ) ; the @xmath16 ( dominantly @xmath17 ) is then the lightest , in between one expects the kaonic state @xmath18 ( @xmath19 interpreted as @xmath20 ) , which is omitted in the compilation of pdg @xcite , but listed in many recent theoretical and experimental works ( @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "evidence for a broad @xmath21 state is also found , together with @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the theoretical work of dobado , olleroset where a unitarized chpt is used ; as shown in ollerosetpelaez , pelaez a broad scalar state @xmath24 exists as well .",
    "the fact that a full scalar nonet is generated within the same approach points to a similar inner structure of the low - lying scalar states .",

    "support for the jaffe s states has also been found in lattice calculations @xcite , where the diquark @xmath9 and the antidiquark @xmath10 are connected by a flux tube .    in @xcite",
    "the scalar states below @xmath27 gev have also a dominant tetraquark structure ; mixing among light tetraquark states and heavy quarkonia states , generating two scalar nonet of mixed states below and above @xmath27 gev is described .    in the present work",
    "we intend to analyze the two - pseudoscalar decays of the scalar states below 1 gev when interpreted as jaffe s tetraquark states ; to this end we consider the dominant and the subdominant diagrams in the large-@xmath25 expansion which describe the transition of a tetraquark scalar state into two pseudoscalars @xcite .",
    "the dominant diagram , depicted in fig .",
    "1.a , occurs by switch of a quark belonging to the compact diquark with an antiquark of the anti - diquark , thus generating two @xmath26 objects , which separate as pseudoscalar mesons : @xmath28 .",
    "the two pseudoscalar mesons fall apart from the tetraquark configuration ; this decay mechanism was denoted as ozi - superallowed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the subdominant diagram , depicted in fig . 1.b , occurs via an annihilation of a quark and an antiquark ( into one gluon ) , with subsequent @xmath26 creation and two - pseudoscalar decay : @xmath29 .",
    "although suppressed by a factor @xmath25 , the fact that the annihilation of the quark - antiquark pair can occur with only one gluon as intermediate state ( as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. to order @xmath30 only , may indeed indicate that the corresponding amplitudes are not negligible .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the subdominant coupling has not been considered in the decay rates ; in @xcite it has been introduced as the last step of the analysis in order to improve the results of the superallowed decays . in the present work we intend to systematically write down the expressions for all scalar - to - pseudoscalars transition amplitudes as functions of the strengths of the dominant ( `` fall apart '' ) and subdominant ( `` one intermediate gluon '' ) diagrams , denoted as @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively . then , by a fitting procedure to experimental known branching ratios , we determine the quantity @xmath33 which measures the intensity of the subdominant decay mechanism with respect to the dominant one .",
    "two possible solutions with a non - zero value of the ratio @xmath34 are discussed , which in turn correspond to different isoscalar mixing configurations .",
    "an interesting feature of the subdominant decay is the strong enhancement of the coupling @xmath35 with respect to @xmath36 thus possibly solving the problem of jaffe s model mentioned in @xcite at the leading ( ozi - superallowed , fig .",

    "1.b can explain the experimental value without introducing explicit @xmath39 clouds dressing the scalar resonances .",
    "we then turn our attention to the decay of scalar states into two photons , which in line of the previous discussion is described by two decay mechanisms ; they are analogous to the strong decay diagrams of fig .",
    "1 , where one replaces the two pseudoscalar mesons in the final state with two photons . we present the theoretical ratios and the phenomenological discussion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we write down the lagrangian for the description of the scalar mesons below @xmath27 gev as tetraquark states ; the mass term and the two - body strong decays are presented . in section 3",
