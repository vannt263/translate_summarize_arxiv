    "are dependent on the crystal structure ( order ) of the lattice .    in this paper , we study a simplistic arrangement of a rectangular grid of constituent elements ; which is a common , two dimensional geometrical arrangement seen in many physical scenarios .",
    "the grid elements are arranged in a rectangular fashion with constant spacing between neighbouring elements and this constant spacing or the period , may have different values along the two perpendicular directions of the rectangular grid .",
    "we mathematically model the angular projection of the grid elements onto a circular screen and try to understand the angular dependence of the projection pattern on various grid parameters .",

    "consider a rectangular grid of points having @xmath0 rows and @xmath1 columns , that is a total number of @xmath2 grid points .",
    "each grid point has an associated circular grid element of radius @xmath3 . for convenience ,",
    "we have taken both @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be odd positive integers and have chosen an orthogonal cartesian coordinate system having axes @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the origin is coincident with the center point of the grid .",
    "immediately , we see that the grid is symmetric with respect to both @xmath4 and @xmath5-axes .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be the constant spacing between neighbouring grid point centers along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions , respectively .",
    "the grid setup is shown in figure ( [ gridsetup ] ) .",
    "we use discrete latin indices @xmath8 to label the grid point center in the @xmath9-th column from the right and @xmath10-th row from the bottom ( ref .",
    "figure [ gridsetup ] ) such that a general point @xmath11 on the grid can be labeled as , @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the grid is , therefore , completely characterized by @xmath15 , @xmath7 and @xmath3 , which we call the parameters of the grid .",
    "the total grid length along the @xmath4 and @xmath5-directions is , respectively , @xmath16 and @xmath17 : [ lxly ] @xmath18 the angular projection of the grid at an angle @xmath19 ( as shown in figure ( [ gridsetup ] ) ) is the projection of all @xmath20 grid elements onto a circular screen of radius @xmath21 , also having its center at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the angle @xmath19 is measured from the negative @xmath5-axis with @xmath22 $ ] and is conventionally taken to be positive in the counter - clockwise direction .",
    "we exclusively work in the range @xmath23 $ ] , since for higher angles , the extension of the results is straightforward due to the two - fold symmetry in the grid setup .",
    "this projection can be physically realized by passing a light beam ( with a plane wave - front)@xcite through the grid at different angles , and detecting it on the concentric circular screen screen kept in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "the shadow regions , against an illuminated background on the screen will be the projection of the grid elements .",
    "these projections can be detected using a photo - detector@xcite which can move along the screen to measure the changes in intensity of light due to the grid pattern . with the grid setup so ready",
    ", we now model the angular projection and relate it to the grid parameters .",
    "we now model the angular projections of the grid onto the concentric circular screen and develop ways to utilize this model in physical situations for appropriate data extraction applications .",
    "we first consider the extent of the projection on the circular screen , that is , the length between the two most separated ( projected ) points .",
    "it is readily seen that this length @xmath25 will be the projected length of the grid diagonal .",
    "we first get an expression for the projected length of the intercepting chord , which can then be used to find the arc length of the projection along the screen .",
    "the chord length can be understood as the projection of the line joining the diagonally opposite grid centers and an additional projected length of @xmath26 due to the finite radii of the grid elements located at the diagonally opposite ends , @xmath27 this can be seen to have a maximum value for @xmath28 .",
    "the length of the projected arc along the circular screen will be denoted be @xmath29 and can be found using the fact that the angle subtended by the projection at the grid center is @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath21 is the radius of the screen , such that , @xmath31 naturally , in the angular range @xmath32 $ ] the projected arc length of the grid is an oscillatory function of the projection angle @xmath19 . in our range",

    "we now go on to determine the angular dependence of the number of distinct projected grid points , the projected length due to the grid elements and other related parameters useful for a data extraction model . at any general @xmath19",
    ", we expect a maximum number of @xmath20 projections of the grid elements , each having a one - dimensional projected length of @xmath38 on the projection chord . in certain angular ranges ,",
    "however , the projection of some grid elements may overlap with one another , and in such a case , each grid element will not project itself distinctly .",
    "we call this the degenerate scenario , since multiple elements on the grid will have a finite overlap with other grid elements . at certain specific values of @xmath19 , there would be a complete overlap between different grid elements and at such angles , the number of projected grid elements will decrease .",
    "around each such specific angle , there would be a finite angular width , within which even though the grid _ centers _ will be distinct , there will be overlap between different grid elements due to the finite extent ( @xmath39 ) of each element .",
    "but the projection at a non - degenerate angle will have all the @xmath40 grid elements ( and therefore , the grid centers ) projected distinctly , each spanning @xmath38 in length .",
    "let @xmath41 be the projected length of the chord due to the grid elements at angle @xmath19 .",
    "for non - degenerate angles , the projection due to the grid elements will have a length given by , @xmath42 however , this condition of non - degeneracy must be accompanied by a constraint on the size of each grid element .",
    "we need to ensure that at non - degenerate angles , there is no overlap between grid elements due to a large @xmath3 since all element projections are confined to a finite chord length @xmath25 .",
    "we impose the following strict condition on the size of each grid element in view of this , @xmath43 this condition essentially demands that the projected length of the grid elements @xmath41 should not exceed the total expanse of the grid projection @xmath25 .",
    "we make it strict by imposing that the maximum possible length of the grid element projections must be smaller than the smallest value of @xmath25 , ensuring there would be no overlap at any non - degenerate angle due to the finite size of each element . though it must be pointed out that the minimum of @xmath25 could be either @xmath44 , and correspondingly @xmath45 or @xmath46 , respectively , and not @xmath47 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a mathematical model for the angular projection of a rectangular arrangement of points in a grid . this simple , yet interesting problem , </S>",
    "<S> has both a scholarly value and applications for data extraction techniques to study the physics of various systems . </S>",
    "<S> our work can interest undergraduate students to understand subtle points in the angular projection of a grid and describes various quantities of interest in the projection with completeness and sufficient rigour . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for certain angular ranges , the projection has non - distinctness , and calculate the details of such angles , and correspondingly , the number of distinct points and the total projected length . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on interesting trends obtained for the projected length of the grid elements and present a simple application of the model to determine the geometry of an unknown grid whose spatial extensions are known , using measurement of the grid projection at two angles only . towards the end , </S>",
    "<S> our model is shown to have potential applications in various branches of physical sciences including crystallography , astrophysics and bulk properties of materials . </S>"
