    "the study of the functional form of the number distribution of stars in galaxies , with which they are born , or the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) has always been of fundamental importance @xcite .",
    "the high - mass end of the stellar imf is in particular focus due to the feedback it gives to the star - forming gas in the form of radiation pressure , kinetic energy from the stellar wind and supernova ejecta and as well the chemical enrichment from the latter source .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath4 to the mass of a star could be set by the `` eddington limit '' @xcite or the point of balance of gravity by the radiation pressure of a star .",
    "however , in practice stellar masses can easily exceed the eddington limit since massive stars are not fully radiative but contain convective cores @xcite .",
    "the next upper limit is set by the possibility of the destruction of a star due to thermal pulsations @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined this limit to be at @xmath5 for [ fe / h]@xmath6 and @xmath7 for [ fe / h]@xmath8 .",
    "difficulties also arise if one considers the growth of a proto - star via gas accretion which is crucial for massive star formation .",
    "here one again encounters the @xmath4 eddington limit .",
    "stellar formation models lead to a mass limit near @xmath9 imposed by feedback on a spherical accretion envelope @xcite .",
    "some observations suggest that proto - stars may be accreting material in disks rather than spheres ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) in which case it may be possible to overcome the radiation pressure at the equator of the proto - star .",
    "studies on the formation of massive stars through disk - accretion with high accretion rates , thereby allowing the radiation to escape preferentially along the poles ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) indeed allow formation of stars with larger masses .",
    "the feedback - induced mass limit can also be avoided if massive stars can form through mergers @xcite . in this scenario , massive stars form via coalescence of intermediate - mass proto - stars in the cores of dense stellar clusters that have undergone core - contraction due to rapid accretion of gas with low specific angular momentum .",
    "the high central density required for the mergers ( @xmath10 pc@xmath11 ) is still difficult to achieve but it should be noted that an observable young cluster is necessarily disposed of a substantial fraction of its natal cloud and is thus likely to be always observed in an expanding and hence diluted phase .",
    "recently - set limits on the radii of embedded clusters indeed suggest them to form very compact @xcite . in this context , it is worthwhile to note that in the computations discussed in the following sections we do get binary coalescence events even in moderately dense stellar clusters .",
    "this happens due to the presence of a substantial number of binaries in the cluster core which have much larger encounter cross sections than single stars due to their bigger geometrical sizes .",
    "while the existence of an upper limit of the stellar mass is rather obvious from theory since several decades , such an upper limit has been established from observations only recently .",
    "there have been some earlier indications of the presence of a cut - off near @xmath12 from observations of young massive clusters , particularly in r136 @xcite in the lmc and in arches cluster @xcite close to our galactic center , but these results were not sufficiently convincing in the sense that no statistical significance were attached to them .",
    "the observed upper limit was considered to be a limitation due to sampling rather than a true limit @xcite .",
    "@xcite also noted that random sampling from an unlimited imf for all star - forming regions in the milky way would lead to the prediction of stars with masses @xmath13 , unless there is a sharp down - turn in the imf beyond several @xmath14 .",
    "+     @xcite for the first time gave a critical look at the question of the existence of a physical upper - limit of @xmath15 in the imf , as observed in r136 ( the central massive star cluster in the 30 doradus region of the lmc ) .",
    "assuming r136 has a mass in the range @xmath16 @xcite , they found that for a canonical imf with @xmath17 , @xmath18 stars are missing in r136 that have masses @xmath19 .",
    "the probability that no stars are observed among the 10 expected ones , assuming @xmath17 , is @xmath20 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the observed massive stellar content of r136 implies a physical stellar mass limit at @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a dearth of @xmath22 stars in the arches cluster , where the shallowing of its stellar mass function due to its rapid tidal dissolution has been incorporated .",
    "the corresponding number of missing stars for a canonical imf is @xmath23 which gives a non - detection probability as small as @xmath24 .",
    "thus the arches cluster also has @xmath21 with a very high significance .",
    "finally , @xcite studied 9 clusters and associations in the milky way , lmc and smc to investigate the expected masses of the most massive stars in these for different upper mass limits ( 120 , 150 , 200 , 1000 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "they concluded that the observed number of massive stars supports the existence of a general physical upper mass cutoff within the range @xmath26 with a high significance .",
    "the massive stellar population of young massive star clusters therefore indicates a physical upper mass limit near @xmath21 which is the canonical upper limit of the stellar imf . one can regard this mass as the limit imposed by the process of star formation under physical conditions achievable in a star - forming core",
    "the origin of this very limit is under investigation and the value should currently be taken as empirical only . as coined by @xcite , a stellar population containing stars with their zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) masses up to @xmath0 is `` saturated '' .    in this paper ,",
    "our concern is again related to the massive stellar population in r136 .",
    "the particular aspect that we focus on is related to a recent study by @xcite .",
    "these authors re - analysed the massive stellar population of r136 in unprecedented detail using hubble space telescope and very large telescope spectroscopy and high spatial resolution near - ir photometry to find 4 stars , within the central @xmath27 pc of r136 , with masses @xmath28 , _",
    "i.e. _ , substantially above the canonical limit one can call such a stellar population , containing single stars with masses substantially exceeding @xmath0 , as `` super - saturated '' and the stars surpassing the canonical upper limit can be called `` super - canonical '' ( @xcite ; hereafter sc ) .",
    "although the stellar population of r136 has been studied by earlier authors , the crucial turn in @xcite is due to these authors consideration that the observed sc stars in r136 , in spite of exhibiting wn - type spectra and possessing strong winds , are actually young , main - sequence stars rather than classical wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars . to take this into account , @xcite incorporate detailed stellar evolutionary models of very massive main - sequence stars that include state - of - the - art treatment of stellar winds which lead to the inference of the sc masses .",
    "more recently however , @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) showed that single stars with masses @xmath29 can indeed form in r136 through mergers of the members in massive binaries .",
    "these authors computed the evolution of model clusters that resemble r136 using the state - of - the - art direct n - body integration code `` nbody6 '' @xcite . in these computationally challenging models ,",
    "all the o - stars were taken to be in tight binaries as observations indicate ( @xcite ; see sec .",
    "[ compute ] ) but the zams mass of a single component never exceeds @xmath30 .",
    "they found that in course of their dynamical evolution , the massive binaries in the model clusters can often merge due to hardening and/or eccentricity enhancement due to dynamical encounters to produce single stars of @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that the presence of sc stars in r136 does not illustrate a violation of the canonical upper limit .",
    "of course , the value of the upper stellar mass limit is not necessarily exactly @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , for definiteness , we take the following _ hypothesis _ : there exists a fundamental upper mass limit of @xmath30 or the canonical limit of zams stars formed in clusters and any observed more massive ( `` super - canonical '' ) star is created from dynamically - induced stellar mergers within the dense young cluster . in this study , we aim to test the above _ hypothesis _ or answer the following question : _ can the observed number of super - canonical stars in r136 be explained by the naturally occurring stellar - dynamical and stellar - evolution processes in r136 ? _ to that end , we utilize the 4 direct n - body computed massive cluster models of paper i mimicking r136 ( sec .",

    "the primary objective of these calculations was to study the ejected ob - stars from r136 , in particular , whether massive runaway stars like vfts 682 and 30 dor 016 can indeed be ejected dynamically from r136 as suspected @xcite . besides good agreement of the kinematics of the massive ejecta with those of these noted runaways , it is also noted in paper i that the tight massive binaries which drive these runaways can merge due to the dynamical interactions leading to the formation of sc stars in each of the models , in agreement with the observed stellar population in r136 @xcite . in this study",
    ", we continue to utilize the results of these computations .",
    "the initial conditions and the method of these calculations are accounted in detail in sec .  2 of paper i which we briefly recapitulate here .",
    "the above computations comprise direct n - body integrations of plummer spheres @xcite with parameters conforming with those of r136 .",
    "the initial mass of the plummer spheres is @xmath32 which is an upper limit for r136 @xcite and the half mass radii are taken to be @xmath33 pc .",
    "the clusters are made of stars with zams masses drawn from a canonical imf @xcite over the range @xmath34 and are of metallicity @xmath35 .",
    "as for the primordial binary population , stars with @xmath36 are all in binaries while all lighter stars are kept single .",
    "this termination of the binary population is due to computational ease ; binaries bottleneck the calculation speed of direct n - body integration significantly so that adopting a full spectrum of primordial binaries ( _ i.e. _ , 100% initial binary fraction ) in models of the size that we compute becomes prohibitive . disregarding the binary population for @xmath37 of course does not affect the ejection of massive stars and mergers of massive binaries significantly",
    "( see paper i for details ) .",
    "following the observed period distribution of o - star binaries @xcite , the orbital periods of the binaries having primary masses @xmath38 are chosen from a uniform distribution between @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the orbital period in days . for primary masses",
    "@xmath41 , the `` birth period distribution '' of @xcite is adopted .",
    "the eccentricity distribution is chosen to be thermal @xcite .",
    "these distributions , however , are not modified via `` eigenevolution '' @xcite as the binary - systems internal interactions between massive pre - main - sequence stars are not yet quantified .",
    "the initial configurations are fully mass - segregated @xcite so that the massive binaries concentrate within the clusters central region . in other words",
    ", it is assumed that the clusters are primordially segregated which was the case for several galactic globular clusters @xcite and young star clusters @xcite . in these mass - segregated initial models ,",
    "the stars are re - distributed over the cluster in such a way that the individual mass groups are in equipartition whilst the overall cluster is in virial equilibrium as well .",
    "the algorithm for creating such systems is described in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we are conforming with the _ observed _ states of massive , young clusters by starting our models binary - rich and mass - segregated .",
    "that is , we _ are not _ choosing some particular fine - tuned initial conditions in order to enhance our results .",
    "+   +     with such an initial setup , these computations are the very first direct n - body calculations under such extreme conditions ( all massive stars in binaries , fully mass - segregated ) . to perform the direct n - body computations , the state - of - the - art `` nbody6 '' integrator",
    "@xcite has been used .",
    "in addition to integrating the particle orbits using the highly accurate fourth - order hermite scheme and dealing with the diverging gravitational forces in close encounters through regularizations , nbody6 also employs the well - tested analytical stellar and binary evolution recipes of @xcite ( the sse and the bse schemes ) .",
    "these prescriptions are based on model stellar evolution tracks computed by @xcite .",
    "the wind mass loss of the massive main - sequence ( hereafter ms ) stars is adopted using the empirical @xcite formula .",
    "the mass loss rates are , of course , appropriately modified on the giant branches and other evolved phases for stars of all masses @xcite .",
    "admittedly , the @xcite mass loss rate is too simplistic for massive stars ; it is likely to grossly underestimate the wind mass loss of massive stellar merger products , which we focus on here , as these objects usually become wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars even in their main sequence phase @xcite .",
    "the above stellar wind recipe is currently the best available one in a direct n - body evolution code ; other widely - used direct n - body codes , _",
    "e.g. _ , the `` starlab '' @xcite and the `` nbody6++ '' @xcite utilize analogous wind treatments . the wind mass loss being crucial for very massive stellar entities @xcite , we consider the effects of more detailed stellar winds separately in sec .",
    "[ scwind ] .",
    "mergers among ms stars are treated in nbody6 by adopting the schemes of @xcite .",
    "when two ms stars collide ( a collision between two single ms stars or between two ms components in a binary due to eccentricity induced by close encounters and/or due to encounter hardening ) , the two main assumptions in the above scheme are ( i ) the merged object is a ms star with the stellar material completely mixed and ( ii ) no mass is lost from the system during the hydrodynamical process leading to the merger .",
    "this no mass - loss assumption is based on the results of sph simulations of ms - ms mergers ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite who show that the mass loss is up to 5% for low - mass ms stars ) but such studies also show that the mixing is only partial .",
    "the age of the merged ms star is assigned based on the amount of unburnt hydrogen fuel gained by the hydrogen - burning core as a result of the mixing . in case of a mass transfer across a ms - ms binary ,",
    "the cases of the original accretor ms star having a radiative and a convective core are treated separately ( included in the bse algorithm ) . for a convective core",
    ", the core grows with the gain of mass and mixes with the unburnt hydrogen fuel so that the accreting ms star appears younger . for the case of a radiative core , the fraction of the hydrogen burnt in the hydrogen - burning core remains nearly unaffected by the gain of mass so that the effective age of the ms star decreases .",
    "however , in any case of a merger between two ms stars , an appropriate amount of mass is removed from the final product if the kinetic energy of their final approach exceeds the binding energy of the merged ms star .",
    "admittedly , there exists some arbitrariness in applying the treatments , appropriate for mergers of low - mass stars , to the cases involving mergers of @xmath42 stars which we consider in the following sections .",
    "the structure of these stars is very different so that it is unclear whether the above collisional mass - loss and mixing criteria will remain valid for such massive stellar mergers .",
    "unfortunately , the outcomes of massive stellar collisions are currently unclear from theoretical studies .",
    "a relatively simplistic but very fast algorithm for treating collisions of massive stars ( the mmams scheme ) by @xcite shows @xmath43 mass loss and partial mixing in encounters of @xmath44 stars . in the absence of a clear understanding",
    ", we continue to utilize the scheme for low mass stellar mergers for massive mergers also .",
    "note that the computed models 1 - 4 of paper i constitute exactly the same cluster model of 4 different randomized ( discrete ) realizations .",
    "each of these models are evolved upto @xmath3 myr which is the widely used age of r136 as inferred from its low mass stellar population @xcite .",
    "the above age estimate is perhaps the most robust one for the r136 s stellar population .      in the four model calculations presented in paper i ( models 1 - 4 )",
    ", there are typically 1 - 2 massive binary mergers per cluster at the very beginning of the computations that form sc stars .",
    "these mergers are found to happen mostly due to high initial eccentricities of the corresponding massive primordial binaries .",
    "although these merger products are highly super - canonical , we consider such immediate mergers as `` accidental '' since the parent binaries would have already merged during their pre - main - sequence evolution .",
    "however , we adhere to the canonical upper limit of @xmath30 for r136 which is a plausible assumption as the limit is deduced from observations of young massive star clusters . hence , we consider the sc stars , that appear due to a collision between the two members of a primordial binary at the very beginning of the cluster evolution ( _ c.f . _",
    "[ fig : sc3 ] ) , as spurious and unrelated to the formation of the initial zams stellar population .",
    "these are artifacts of the chosen eccentricity distribution .",
    "the sc stars that are formed later in the course of the cluster evolution are , of course , considered genuine .",
    "notably , the presence of 1 - 2 spurious ( single ) sc stars is not expected to affect the dynamical evolution of our model clusters in any significant way as for a massive primordially mass - segregated system like ours , there are anyway a large number of massive stars in the cluster s central region",
    ". therefore the inclusion of a few more massive single stars is unlikely to provide a substantial additional effect .",
    "it is , of course , not impossible that two massive stars happen to collide to form a single sc star at the birth of a cluster , but it seems unphysical that it could be an eccentricity effect which is always the case for the above mentioned accidental sc stars , which is why we consider them spurious .",
    "the conditions under which such `` primordial - mergers '' can happen and their chances is beyond the scope of the present study . in any case , apart form their negligible contribution to the dynamics of their host clusters , it is unlikely to find any such primordially - merged star in its sc state in r136 at its current age , due to the short sc lifetime , so that the currently observed ones should all be dynamically formed .",
    "we elaborate the latter point in sec .",

    ", we perform 5 additional computations with the same initial configuration ( but different realizations ) as in paper i ( see sec .",
    "[ initcond ] ) except that all the primordial binaries are initially taken to be circular .",
    "of course , the most realistic approach would be to `` eigenevolve ''",
    "i.e. _ , to incorporate the pre - main - sequence evolution of each of the primordial binaries to determine their eccentricities and mass - ratios at the beginning of the computations . however , the nature of eigenevolution is not yet known for progenitors of massive stars . typically , the tidal interaction between the proto - massive - star members would circularize the tight binary orbits but wide binaries would still remain eccentric .",
    "currently , it is unclear in the literature what would be the exact outcome of eigenevolution of massive proto - stellar binaries . as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ res ] , if only the dynamically formed sc stars are considered , their population is similar for the calculations in paper i and in these new computations , _ i.e. _ , the primordial binaries eccentricity distribution does not play a significant role .",

    "a collision and subsequent merger occurs between the components when their periastron separation becomes smaller than the sum of their radii .",
    "the single stars in the cluster s central region arise from dissociation of wider binaries by encountering with harder binaries or by direct ionization ( _ i.e. _ , detachment of a binary due to its encounter with a single star of kinetic energy larger than its binding energy ) .",

    "sc stars also form due to encounter hardening @xcite of the orbits of appropriate binaries resulting in a roche lobe overflow .",

    "[ fig : circbin ] and [ fig : scrad ] ) .    by the same argument , _",
    "the above detailed evolutionary models of the sc stars imply that those observed in r136 would have evolved below the canonical limit by the present day had they been primordial , _",
    "i.e. _ , had they been formed at the cluster s birth , thereby violating the canonical upper limit , assuming the widely used @xmath3 myr age of r136 @xcite .",
    "this strongly supports our dynamical formation scenario of the observed sc stars in r136 _ which causes them to form sufficiently later so as to make them visible during their sc phases at the present day .",
    "this is well supported by our computations .",
    "admittedly , there are several drawbacks and incompleteness in the above line of arguments .",
    "first , the detailed stellar evolutionary models of @xcite have been considered independently of the dynamics of the model clusters .",
    "the newer stellar evolutionary models would result in stronger wind mass loss from the cluster core and would contribute to the dilution of the cluster s central potential to a larger extent than that from the nbody6 s native stellar evolutionary scheme @xcite .",
    "however , in our computations the cluster s core , where the binary mergers occur , is populated by a large number of hard massive binaries due to our initial conditions ( sec .",
    "[ initcond ] ) , _ which are all in accordance with observations of young star clusters _ ( see sec .",
    "[ initcond ] and references therein ) . in that case",
    ", the dynamics of the cluster s central region will be dominated by the energy generated in the super - elastic binary - single and binary - binary encounters @xcite and the stellar mass loss would not affect the dynamical encounter rates in the cluster s center significantly .    it is true that the mass loss from the individual companions of a binary would result in expansion of the binary orbit and hence dilute its hardness .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite , this effect is counteracted by the dynamical hardening @xcite of the binaries so that they remain hard throughout . in the n - body calculations of @xcite ,",
    "even just a single binary survives to remain hard in their model cluster s core and dominates the energy generation in the cluster s core ( until its ejection ) . with a large number of binaries , as in our case , the encounter hardening and the corresponding energy generation would be substantially stronger as the binaries provide much larger encounter cross sections than single stars due to their much bigger geometrical size ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "noticeably , even after including stellar wind mass loss , the computed single - star - only models of @xcite undergo deep core - collapse within @xmath3 myr , _",
    "i.e. _ , the effects of dynamical relaxation and negative specific heat @xcite themselves dominate over the wind mass loss .",
    "our models , of course , do not core collapse due to the substantial energy release from the central primordial binaries .",
    "another drawback of the above arguments is that they are based on stellar evolution models that begin from zams with normal composition .",
    "the sc stars are merger products of o - stars that are evolved from their zero age and therefore would be he - enriched and substantially rotating . while we do consider rotating models , the initial he fraction is taken to be that appropriate for the lmc , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath64 @xcite . to obtain a basic estimate of the he - richness of the merged product ,",
    "let us consider two @xmath14 stars that merge to form a typical @xmath65 sc star at a typical cluster age of 1.5 myr .",
    "each of the initial stars ( before merger ) would possess a h - burning core of @xmath66 and at the above merging age their core he fraction @xmath67 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath68 he per star ) according to the above newer models ( karen khler ; private communication ) . assuming an ideal complete mixing and no mass loss during the merger process , the new he abundance of the merged product would be @xmath69 which would also be the rejuvenated surface value @xmath70 ; for a partial mixing the surface abundance would be lower . while this @xmath70 is large enough to drive a stronger wind from the newly formed sc star compared to that for its zams value @xmath71 , it is still moderately above the zams value and less than the abundance at which the wr winds turns on ( @xmath72 ; see sec .",
    "[ scwind ] ) .",
    "therefore , a drastically large wind from the newly formed sc star is not expected .",
    "the above discussions imply that none of the shortcomings or uncertainties of our approach dictate to the impossibility of observations of sc stars in r136 ; rather such observations are still feasible .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the sc star formation in the computed models of paper i and in the new computations .",
    "our general conclusions from the computations are as follows :    * formation of sc stars due to dynamically induced mergers of massive binaries are common in a r136-type cluster . in most of the computations we find multiple sc stars formed within @xmath73 myr which is appropriate for r136 ( @xcite ; see figs .",
    "[ fig : sc3 ] & [ fig : circbin ] ) .",
    "most sc stars are formed single while a few of them initially form in wide binaries . *",
    "the sc stars typically begin to appear from @xmath50 myr cluster age or even earlier ( _ c.f . _",
    "table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "they tend to form with equal likeliness over a cluster age of 1 - 3 myr . *",
    "the most massive sc star formed in a given computed model is typically close to @xmath74 and the most massive one formed is @xmath75 ( `` model 3 '' ; _ c.f . _",
    "table  [ tab1 ] ) . the cluster age @xmath76 corresponding to the formation of the most massive sc star is typically well within @xmath73 myr ( _ c.f . _ table  [ tab1 ] ) . *",
    "multiple sc stars are occasionally found to exist simultaneously near the cluster s center which are bound to the cluster , over a representative sc phase lifetime of @xmath63 myr , within @xmath73 myr ( _ c.f .",
    "_ table  [ tab1 ] ) cluster age .",
    "this , along with the second point above , implies that it is quite plausible that r136 harbours multiple sc stars at the present day . *",
    "some sc stars are formed with runaway velocities and escape ( _ c.f .",
    "[ scform ] ; fig .",
    "[ fig : scrad ] ) .",
    "these conclusions conform with the observations by @xcite who found 4 sc stars in r136 in the initial mass range of @xmath77 . in our computations , sc stars of up to @xmath75",
    "are formed which is consistent with the observations taking into account the large uncertainties in the stellar evolution models in this mass range . also , only one of the models ( `` model 3 '' ) has up to 4 sc stars simultaneously bound to the cluster ( over a 1.5 myr period ) although other models also host multiple sc stars close to the cluster s center .",
    "some models however contain only one bound sc star within 3 myr ( _ c.f . _ table  [ tab1 ] ) .    at this point",
    ", it is worthwhile to note that our above conclusions depend somewhat on the age of the r136 cluster which is , of course , not fully settled yet . while the bulk of r136 is @xmath3 myr old @xcite the high - mass stellar population might be younger @xcite . in our computations ,",
    "the sc stars typically begin to appear from @xmath78 myr cluster age and several of them appear by @xmath79 myr .",
    "this time - frame is quite consistent with the possible @xmath80 myr age of r136 s massive stellar population given the wide uncertainties in the age of such a young cluster particularly for the massive end of the imf .",
    "there has so far been no direct estimate of the age of the massive end of the stellar population of r136 and the above age - limit is based only on comparisons with the stellar populations of car ob1 and ngc 3603 @xcite . given that the stellar imf of r136 continues to maintain the canonical law @xcite from the low to the high mass range ( @xmath81 ; @xcite ) , we find it more natural to consider that the whole stellar population of the r136 cluster has formed in a single starburst event whithout a significant age spread .",
    "the issue can , of course , be more resolved with better understanding of the evolution of very massive stars and their winds .",
    "finally , a recent study by @xcite shows that the o - star binary distribution can , in fact , be even harder ( _ i.e. _ , more bound or tighter ) than that considered in our computations ( see sec .",
    "[ initcond ] ) .",
    "this would lead to the formation of sc stars even earlier which constitutes an important future study .",
    "it is important to remember that the formation of sc stars at early ages in the above computations is facilitated by the adopted initial complete mass segregation .",
    "this condition subjects the massive binaries to strong dynamical encounters from the beginning of the cluster evolution .",
    "note however that primordial mass segregation is inferred to have been true for several galactic globular clusters @xcite and open clusters @xcite .",
    "notably , for a completely unsegregated model , it would take @xmath82 myr for the massive binaries to segregate to the cluster s center which makes the early formation of sc stars unlikely . however , the mass segregation timescale shortens substantially with increasing compactness of the cluster . in this context , an important outlook would be to study the formation of sc stars with varying initial compactness and degree of primordial mass segregation .",
    "the drawbacks of the computed r136 models , as discussed in paper i ( see sec .",
    "4 of paper i ) , naturally carry over to the present analyses .",
    "these limitations however do not crucially affect sc formation .",
    "in particular , the truncation of the binary distribution at @xmath83 does not influence the mergers of the most massive binaries , the latter being much more centrally concentrated due to mass segregation . also , the exact period distribution of the o - star binaries is not instrumental for the formation of the sc stars as long as o - stars are largely found in tight binaries @xcite .",
    "notably , our adopted range of the orbital period for the o - star binaries is similar to that reported by @xcite ( see paper i ) .",
    "the formation of sc stars is generally similar for models with initially thermally distributed eccentricities ( paper i ) and for the newer ones with initially circular binaries ( except for the spurious sc stars in the former models ) .",
    "this implies that the initial eccentricity distribution of the massive binaries does not crucially influence the formation of sc stars .",
    "the most consistent and accurate way to address the above discussed concerns regarding the effects of a stronger wind mass loss due to the newer stellar evolutionary models is to incorporate the latter in a direct n - body code which is well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "no such direct n - body code exists at the present time .",
    "furthermore , there are substantial uncertainties in the physics of mergers of massive stars at the present time .",
    "therefore , the conclusions in this work are the best one can draw given the current technical limitations .",
    "perhaps it would be possible to do such work in future with a distributively computing , highly modular n - body calculation framework such as `` muse '' @xcite . in spite of all these uncertainties it is worthwhile to note that",
    "if one focuses to the particular case of r136 , then ( a ) the existence of sc stars is _ strongly supported by observations _ and",
    "( b ) considering the widely used @xmath3 myr age of r136 , the sc stars must have formed later than the birth of r136 .",
    "our computations are consistent with the formation of sc stars through dynamically induced mergers of massive binaries . while there are technologically - limited drawbacks in our present analysis , as elaborated in sec .",
    "[ scobs ] , none of these shortcomings dictate to the non - observation of sc stars in r136 .",
    "therefore , we can say that we have justified the _ hypothesis _ of sec .",
    "[ intro ] through our detailed n - body modelling of r136 with initial conditions chosen in accordance with observations of young star clusters .",
    "in other words , from our realistically modelled computations of r136-like star clusters , and from our analyses as presented above , it can now be more definitely concluded that the observed super - saturated stellar population in r136 does not imply a violation of the canonical stellar upper mass limit near @xmath30 .",
