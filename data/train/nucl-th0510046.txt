    "in the spectra of @xmath0ca , the existence of low - lying deformed states has long been known since 1960s@xcite .",
    "the coexistence of the spherical and various deformed states in the doubly magic nuclei @xmath0ca has attracted a great interest . in the positive parity states below 7 mev , besides the spherical ground state , the existence of two deformed rotational bands built on the @xmath7 state at 3.35 mev and the @xmath2 state at 5.21 mev is known experimentally .",
    "the structure of these bands has been often discussed in relation to many - particle many - hole states of nuclei in this mass region for a long time .",
    "grace and green @xcite firstly suggested that the former band is dominantly a @xmath8-@xmath9 state , while the latter band with a large deformation is understood as an @xmath3-@xmath4 state .",
    "the member states of the first @xmath10=@xmath11 rotational band built on the @xmath7 state are known to be strongly populated by @xmath12-transfer reactions and to have the large @xmath12 spectroscopic factors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12+@xmath13 cluster structure of this band has been studied theoretically based on semi - microscopic cluster model calculations@xcite .",
    "the states in the second @xmath10=@xmath11 band have been observed in the experimental work searching for the @xmath3-@xmath4 states with @xmath14s(@xmath5c,@xmath12)@xmath0ca reactions , which were performed by middleton _",
    "et al . _ in 1972 @xcite .",
    "due to the strong population in the multi - nucleon transfer data and the strong @xmath1 transitions @xcite , the @xmath11(5.21 mev ) , @xmath15(5.63 mev ) and @xmath16 ( 6.54 mev ) have been thought to belong to the superdeformed band with a dominant @xmath3-@xmath4 configuration .",
    "recently , by using the gammasphear array detectors , the level structure of the deformed bands in @xmath0ca has been explored and many excited states up to very high spins have been discovered @xcite .",
    "consequently , the existence of the superdeformed band of @xmath0ca built on the @xmath17(5.21 mev ) has been experimentally well established .",
    "in contrast to the experimental situation , theoretical interpretation of the superdeformed band is not well established and is still complicated . with",
    "the symmetry restricted skyrme - hartree - fock(hf ) calculations , zheng _ et al .",
    "_ studied the energy systematics of @xmath18particle-@xmath18hole(@xmath19-@xmath20 ) states in @xmath0ca@xcite .",
    "they suggested an @xmath3-@xmath4 deformed states as a local minimum of the energy as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "they also predicted highly deformed @xmath21-@xmath22 states in a high excitation energy region .",
    "however , the recent mean - field calculations suggest that the @xmath3-@xmath4 configuration becomes unstable , especially when the model space is extended .",
    "based on the three - dimensional(3d ) hf calculations without any assumption of the spatial symmetry , inakura _ et al .",
    "_ studied the energy surface of @xmath23 as the function of the quadrupole deformation .",
    "they have shown that the local minimum of the superdeformed @xmath3-@xmath4 configuration on the energy curve becomes quite shallow or even disappear due to the @xmath24 and octupole deformations depending on the effective interaction , though the @xmath21-@xmath22 state and an oblate state remain to be local minima in any of used effective interactions .",
    "they have pointed out that the extreme softness of the superdeformed @xmath3-@xmath4 configuration against the octupole deformation ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the instability of the @xmath3-@xmath4 configuration and the stability of the @xmath21-@xmath22 and oblate solutions in @xmath0ca had been also reported by leander and larsson@xcite based on the macroscopic - microscopic model calculations .",
    "further calculations beyond mean - field theory were performed by bender _",
    "et al . _ with gcm calculations in hf+bcs",
    "approach @xcite . in their results ,",
    "the superdeformed band is not dominated by a certain @xmath19-@xmath20 configuration but it contains various configurations such as @xmath8-@xmath9 , @xmath27-@xmath28 , and @xmath3-@xmath4 states due to the strong mixture between these configurations .",
    "moreover , shell model calculations were performed for description of the superdeformed bands@xcite .",
    "although the level structure and quadrupole moments of the superdeformed band are described by the spherical shell model with the fixed @xmath3-@xmath4 configurations , however , when the model space is extended to include other particle - hole configurations , the quadrupole moments are much underestimated due to the configuration mixing .",
    "these facts may imply that a stable solution for the intrinsic state of the superdeformation is hardly obtained in the modern calculations with mean - field approaches .",
    "it seems to be somehow inconsistent with the experimental energy spectra of the superdeformation in which no large deviation from the rigid rotor model is seen @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that there might be some mechanism beyond mean - field approaches to stabilize the superdeformation .",
    "the cluster aspect is one of the essential features for nuclear deformation even in @xmath29-@xmath30 shell nuclei together with the mean - field aspect .",
    "indeed , it has been already shown that two kinds of nature , i.e. cluster and mean - field coexist in the deformed states in @xmath29-shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "we expect that the clustering can play an important role also in the formation of the superdeformed state of @xmath23 . in case of @xmath0ca",
    ", we consider that the softness against octupole deformations in the superdeformed state suggested by inakura _ et al .",
    "_ can be associated with asymmetric di - cluster structure , though , to our knowledge , there has been no studies to investigate its cluster aspect .",
    "we also note that some @xmath29-shell nuclei have the remarkable cluster aspect , molecular resonances , whose properties have been investigated by cluster models .",
    "recently , there are theoretical efforts to link the molecular resonances with low - lying deformed states with full microscopic calculations .",
    "it is suggested that the molecular resonances and the low - lying deformed states in @xmath29-shell are regarded to be a series of molecular bands .",
    "for example , in @xmath14s system , it has been suggested that @xmath31o-@xmath31o molecular resonances are built on the superdeformed band of @xmath14s @xcite owing to the excitation of the inter - cluster motion .",
    "therefore , we consider that molecular resonances can be good probes to understand the cluster aspect of the low - lying deformed states . in @xmath0ca system , there are experimental implications of @xmath6si+@xmath5c molecular resonances in the low - energy fusion cross section@xcite and also elastic scattering data@xcite , where distinct structures have been found in the energy region @xmath32=20 - 30 mev above the @xmath6si+@xmath5c threshold .",
    "it is interesting to look into possible appearance of molecular resonances and its relation to the superdeformation in @xmath0ca .    in this paper",
    ", we study deformed states in @xmath0ca with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) .",
    "the method of amd has been proved to be useful in description of shape coexistence as well as cluster structure in @xmath29-shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "one of advantages of this method is that both cluster aspect and mean - field aspect can be described within the amd framework . in order to study the coexistence of deformations in @xmath0ca and to investigate the corresponding rotational bands , we apply a constraint amd method .",
    "parity projection , which is essentially important to describe the parity asymmetric shape of nuclei , is performed before energy variation , while total - angular - momentum projection is done after the energy variation .",
    "we also perform superposition of the wave functions with different configurations obtained by the constraint amd to obtain better wave functions and to describe possible configuration mixing .",
    "level scheme and @xmath1 transition strengths are calculated from these superposed wave functions . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the effective nuclear interaction which contains finite - range 2-body and 3-body forces proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this interaction is suitable for describing the nuclear structure properties such as binding energies and radii over a wide mass number region from @xmath33he to @xmath0ca .",
    "moreover , it is also useful to describe nucleus - nucleus potential .",
    "these features can not be described by zero - range forces such as the skyrme forces , and are superior points of the effective forces with finite - range three - body terms .",
    "we believe that they are essential to represent cluster aspect and to investigate properties of many - particle - many - hole states with large deformations .",

    "the orientation of the intrinsic spin is expressed by a variational complex parameter @xmath45 , and the isospin function is fixed to be up(proton ) or down(neutron ) .",

    "the energy of @xmath12-cluster state does not so much change from ( i ) to ( ii ) because the effect of the spin - orbit force is smaller than other excited states . as a result",

    "all the solutions for @xmath106 have almost spherical shapes with @xmath107 .",
    "it means that different configurations with the same @xmath88 value are obtained as optimum solutions for the given @xmath57 .",
    "we illustrate the density distribution of the intrinsic state @xmath63 in fig.[fig : ca - dense ] and fig.[fig : ca - dense18 ] .",
    "a remarkable point is that parity asymmetric structure appears in the prolate states .",
    "especially , one of striking features is the prominent cluster structure like @xmath5c+@xmath6si in the large prolate deformation . comparing the results of ( i ) and ( ii ) , we remark that the intrinsic structure for a given @xmath57 is almost the same as each other .",
    "it means that the structure of coexisting shapes is not sensitive to the choice of either interaction ( i ) or ( ii ) except for the @xmath12-cluster state .",
    "in contrast , the excitation energies strongly depend on the strength of the spin - orbit force as shown in the comparison between the results with a stronger spin - orbit force(i ) and with a weaker one(ii ) .",
    "particularly , the oblate state and the superdeformed state appear at the low excitation energies in the results with the interaction(i ) , but they exist at much higher excitation energies with the interaction(ii ) .",
    "considering the @xmath8-@xmath9 configuration in the oblate shape and the @xmath5c-@xmath6si clustering in the superdeformed state , it is easily understood that the excitation energies of these states decrease with the stronger spin - orbit force(i ) than with the weaker one(ii ) .",
    "although the systematics of the binding energy in the @xmath29-shell region seems to be reproduced better by the force(ii ) than the force(i ) , however , the excitation energy of the superdeformed state is reasonably reproduced with the force(i ) while they are largely overestimated by the force(ii ) .",
    "the force(i ) also reproduces the excitation energy of the lowest negative - parity state(@xmath108 ) rather well than the force(ii ) as shown later .",
    "therefore , we examine mainly the results(i ) , because our interest is in excited states of @xmath0ca , especially in the properties of the superdeformed state .",
    "we should note again that the structure of the superdeformed state is stable in both cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , and most of the intra - band properties of the superdeformed band does not so much depend on the choice of the interaction(i ) or ( ii ) except for the relative energy to the ground state and other rotational bands .",
    "now we turn to negative - parity states . in fig.[fig : beqc - np ] , we show the energies of @xmath109(@xmath110 ) and @xmath111(@xmath112 ) , obtained with the interaction(i ) , as functions of ( a ) @xmath57 and ( b ) @xmath88 .",

    ", we could not obtain a satisfactory description of the experimental deformed band build on the @xmath7(3.35 mev ) .",
    "possible assignment of this band is to the theoretical normal - deformed band , the @xmath12-cluster band , or admixture of them .    in the anslysis of single - particle orbits",
    ", we found the particle - hole nature of the superdeformed state , the oblate state and the @xmath12-cluster state , which are dominated by the @xmath3-@xmath4 , @xmath8-@xmath9 and @xmath8-@xmath9 configurations , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", the normal deformation in the present results contains mixing of @xmath244-@xmath245 , @xmath8-@xmath9 and @xmath27-@xmath28 configurations .",
    "one of new findings in the present study is that the superdeformed state has a parity asymmetric shape with @xmath5c+@xmath6si - like cluster structure .",
    "from the point of view of a single - particle picture , we discussed the relation between the cluster aspect and the many - particle many - hole aspect .",
    "we found that the origin of the @xmath5c clustering in the superdeformed state is understood by the correlation of 12 nucleons ; 4 @xmath29-shell nucleons with the @xmath12-cluster correlation and the 8 valence nucleons in the @xmath237-like orbits .",
    "it reveals the coexistence of cluster and mean - field aspect in the superdeformed state .",
    "namely , the @xmath12-cluster correlation in deeply bound nucleons composing the core @xmath81ne plays an important role in the parity asymmetric shape , while the particle - hole nature arises in the single - particle levels at the energy surface . the present result of the dominant @xmath3-@xmath4 feature in the superdeformation seems to be consistent with the strong population of the members in the superdeformed band observed in 8-nucleon - transfer reactions;@xmath14s(@xmath5c,@xmath12)@xmath0ca@xcite .",
    "however , it is inconsistent with the gcm+hfbcs calculations@xcite , where neither the @xmath8-@xmath9 nor the @xmath3-@xmath4 hf solutions can be assigned to the bandheads of the normal - deformed band or superdeformed band",
    ". one of the advantages of the present framework is the parity projection before energy variation , which is considered to be important in arising of the parity - asymmetric deformation .",
    "we think that one of the key properties which stabilize the `` @xmath3-@xmath4 '' character in the superdeformed band is the @xmath5c+@xmath6si clustering which causes a parity asymmetric shape .",
    "compared with the gcm+hfbcs calculations@xcite , the higher correlations are ignored in the present calculations .",
    "for example , the number of the basis in the superposition is ten at most , which is much smaller than the case of the gcm+hfbcs calculations@xcite .",
    "moreover , since we adopt the constraint on the total number of ho quanta in the energy variation , some basis are missed in terms of gcm with respect to the generator coordinate @xmath88 , which are often used in the gcm+hf calculations .",
    "the pairing correlations are also ignored .",
    "it is an remaining problem to check how the properties of the superdeformation are affected by introducing these effects .    above the superdeformed band",
    ", we found possible higher rotational bands based on @xmath5c+@xmath6si - clustering in the large prolate deformations .",
    "it is predicted that @xmath5c+@xmath6si molecular bands may be built due to the excitation of the inter - cluster motion .",
    "the present results suggest that the superdeformed band and these higher molecular bands are regarded as a series of @xmath5c+@xmath6si molecular bands .",
    "this means that the @xmath5c+@xmath6si cluster aspect is rather prominent in the superdeformed state than @xmath14s+@xmath258 aspect , although the latter may be naively expected from the @xmath3-@xmath4 feature of this state .",
    "we also suggest the negative - parity bands caused by the parity asymmetric deformation .    in the present work ,",
    "we use the stronger spin - orbit force than the nuclear interaction adopted in ref.@xcite to quantitatively reproduce the excitation energies of the superdeformed band and negative parity states . with the original weak spin - orbit force , the excitation energies of all the excited states in @xmath0ca are overestimated .",
    "we would like to stress again that the intra - band properties such as energy spectra , @xmath1 transitions and intrinsic structure of the superdeformed band are not sensitive to choice of either interaction . in order to solve the remaining problems",
    ", it may be necessary to introduce a suitable nuclear interaction and extended model wave functions .",
