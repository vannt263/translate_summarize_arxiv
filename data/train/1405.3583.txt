    "a nanopore is simply a hole of small size in an impermeable membrane separating two regions containing an electrolytic buffer .",
    "a size range of 1100 nm is fairly typical .",
    "living cells and intracellular organelles are usually bounded by lipid membranes containing nanopores constructed of membrane - bound proteins .",
    "the transport of small molecules and polymers across such nanopores is a very common feature in living cells and is essential to their normal function @xcite .",
    "synthetic nanopores @xcite have been the focus of much interest in recent years following the demonstration of their use as effective single molecule sensors @xcite .",
    "the main distinguishing feature of nanopore systems responsible for many of the novel effects is that their geometric dimensions are small enough so that electrokinetic effects are important .",
    "such effects have been invoked to explain a range of observations relating to experiments involving free as well as hindered translocation of dna across synthetic nanopores @xcite .",
    "nanopores also exhibit other unusual properties , some of which could be potentially exploited to build novel microfluidic devices .",
    "for example , conical nanopores fabricated on plastic films using the ion track - etching technique @xcite have been shown to exhibit ion current rectification similar to that of semiconductor diodes @xcite .",
    "a similar effect has been reported recently for electroosmotic flow out of nanocapillaries @xcite . a nonlinear electrokinetic effect known as induced charge electroosmosis ( iceo )",
    "@xcite produces vortices at the edges of nanopores resembling recirculation vortices in separated flows even though the reynolds number in such applications is essentially zero . mixing due to these flow structures @xcite together with electroconvective instabilities @xcite are thought to be responsible for the `` overlimiting '' behaviour of the current  voltage characteristics of perm selective pores and membranes described by @xcite .",
    "similar vortical structures may be generated in cylindrical channels that undergo a sudden constriction when the relevant length scales are on the order of the debye length  @xcite .",
    "if an electric field @xmath0 is applied across an uncharged membrane , induced charge electroosmosis leads to velocities @xmath1 with no net flow through the membrane unless symmetry is somehow broken .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of flow through nanopores in uncharged membranes , such as graphene sheets @xcite , show that differences in mobility between cations and anions can result in asymmetric debye layers and consequent net flow through the membrane .",
    "symmetry is also broken if the membrane is charged , so that the intrinsic field due to the membrane competes with the externally applied field in determining the distribution of ions in the debye layer @xcite .",
    "if a voltage is applied across a charged membrane containing a long narrow pore an electroosmotic flow is generated by the electric field acting on the charge cloud of counter - ions in the fluid adjacent to the fixed charges at the solid / fluid interface .",
    "the strength of this flow is proportional to the applied electric field , and thus , inversely proportional to the membrane thickness if the membrane is sufficiently thick .",
    "however , the flow does not increase indefinitely as the membrane is progressively thinned .",
    "if the membrane is much thinner than the diameter of the hole , the flow is driven mainly by electroosmosis at the membrane surface exterior to the pore , rather than by electric forces within the pore itself .    here",
    "we present results for the flow rate through a pore in a charged membrane in the limit of a weak applied field . in section [ sec : zerothick ]",
    "we use the reciprocal theorem to calculate the flow rate through a circular hole in a charged membrane of zero thickness .",
    "the result is obtained in terms of an integral which in general has to be evaluated numerically but can be obtained analytically when the pore size is much smaller than the debye length . in section [ sec : fullsim ] we present computer simulations of the full problem based on numerical solutions of the poisson - nernst - planck - stokes system of equations using a finite volume method .",

    "the hole within the membrane has characteristic size @xmath19 , and we make no assumption concerning @xmath20 , the ratio of the hole size to the debye length @xmath21 . when @xmath22 , the charge clouds from opposite sides of the perimeter of the hole overlap , but this has little effect upon the electrical conductivity of the hole when ( as here ) the surface charge density @xmath8 and the resulting perturbations to the ionic number densities @xmath23 are small .",
    "similarly , any ion exclusion effects of the overlapping charge cloud are negligible .",
    "we also note that the ion exclusion properties of a thin membrane are in general smaller than those of a long cylindrical pore .",

    "we assume that the potential @xmath32 which characterises the applied field is small compared to the equilibrium zeta potential @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 has already been assumed small in order that we may describe the charge cloud by means of the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation .",
    "we use the dimensionless field strength @xmath43 as the basis for a perturbation expansion :    & = & _ 1 + + & = & _ 0 + _ 1 + + n^i & = & n_0^i + n_1^i + ,    where the subscript 0 refers to the equilibrium cloud , and the caret @xmath44 denotes a nondimensional quantity .",
    "the steady - state ion conservation equation , correct to @xmath45 , becomes @xmath46 where the peclet number @xmath47 characterizes the ratio of ionic convection to diffusion .",

    "the contribution of such effects to the net fluid flux , @xmath31 , is at best very weak .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , since even when ( as here ) there are sharp corners , if the membrane is uncharged and the electrolyte is symmetric ( with identical ionic mobilities ) , symmetry dictates that iceo can not generate a net flow @xmath31 through the pore .",
