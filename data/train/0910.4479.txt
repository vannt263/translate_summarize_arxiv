    "<S> we propose a nonlocal theory of single - particle excitations . it is based on an off - diagonal effective medium and the projection operator method for treating the retarded green function . </S>",
    "<S> the theory determines the nonlocal effective medium matrix elements by requiring that they are consistent with those of the self - energy of the green function . </S>",
    "<S> this arrows for a description of long - range intersite correlations with high resolution in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> numerical study for the half - filled hubbard model on the simple cubic lattice demonstrates that the theory is applicable to the strong correlation regime as well as the intermediate regime of coulomb interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the results show that nonlocal excitations cause sub - bands in the strong coulomb interaction regime due to strong antiferromagnetic correlations , decrease the quasi - particle peak on the fermi level with increasing coulomb interaction , and shift the critical coulomb interaction @xmath0 for the divergence of effective mass towards higher energies at least by a factor of two as compared with that in the single - site approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> the description of single - particle excitations in correlated electron systems has been a challenging problem because new phenomena are observed there and because simple perturbation approaches are not applicable @xcite . at present , excitations in the systems of infinite dimensions have been clarified by use of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that theory makes use of a momentum - independent self - energy , and determines the energy self - consistently by solving an impurity problem with use of advanced many - body theories . </S>",
    "<S> the dmft can be traced back to the many - body coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) for magnetic alloys @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also known to be equivalent to the dynamical cpa  @xcite for describing finite - temperature magnetism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , we proposed the projection operator method cpa ( pm - cpa ) @xcite , which is equivalent to the dmft too . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the projection technique applied to the retarded green function and on an energy - dependent liouville operator .    </S>",
    "<S> the theories mentioned above are based on a single - site approximation ( ssa ) which neglects the off - diagonal components of the self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the momentum dependence of excitations in real systems is described incompletely . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a nonlocal theory of excitations which extends the pm - cpa , and demonstrate that it describes self - consistently momentum - dependent excitations with high resolution in the strong coulomb interaction regime as well as in the intermediate regime .    </S>",
    "<S> we adopt here the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath1 with nearest - neighbor transfer integral @xmath2 and intra - atomic coulomb interaction @xmath3 , and consider the retarded green function @xmath4 here the inner product between two operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7_{+ } \\rangle$ ] with use of a thermal average @xmath8 and the anti - commutator @xmath9_{+}$ ] . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , @xmath28 is a liouville operator acting on the space orthogonal to the space @xmath29 ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a projection operator defined by @xmath33 .    in our nonlocal theory , we introduce an energy - dependent liouville operator @xmath34 for an effective hamiltonian @xmath35 of an off - diagonal medium @xmath36 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath37 . here </S>",

    "<S> it should be noted that the green function @xmath39 becomes identical with @xmath42 when @xmath43 thus , @xmath39 describes properly many - body excitations when the above relation is satisfied .    in order to obtain an explicit expression of the self - energy @xmath44 , we separate the liouvillean @xmath12 into @xmath34 and the remaining interaction part @xmath45 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath46 , and expand the memory function ( [ rmem ] ) by using the incremental method : @xmath47 here @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> these terms are all calculated from cluster memory functions defined by @xmath50 . </S>",

    "<S> note that a `` cluster '' @xmath56 , for example , does not mean that sites @xmath57 are nearest neighbors . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ icrij ] ) , the self - energy @xmath58 depends on the medium @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we then determine the medium self - consistently from condition ( [ sceqij ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the present theory reduces to the pm - cpa ( _ i.e. _ , the dmft ) in infinite dimensions .    in the above self - consistent theory </S>",
    "<S> , one needs explicit expressions for the cluster memory functions , for which we apply the renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt ) @xcite . @xmath59_{ij\\sigma } \\ . \\label{memcij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .     </S>",

    "<S> finally the momentum dependent excitation spectra are calculated from the green function @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the hartree - fock one - electron energy eigen value , and the momentum - dependent self - energy is calculated via fourier transform of the off - diagonal self - energy as @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed numerical calculations for the single - particle excitation spectra on a simple cubic lattice at half - filling . in the nonlocal self - energy calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we have taken all two - site pairs up to 10-th nearest neighbors , and neglected the clusters beyond the 2 sites . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows an example of the momentum - dependent spectra along high - symmetry lines for @xmath62 in unit of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> we find quasiparticle states near the fermi level , which form a narrow band with averaged quasiparticle weight @xmath77 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the lower ( upper ) hubbard band is enhanced around the @xmath78 ( r ) point . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the energy splitting between the main peaks of the lower and upper hubbard bands is about 20 , being larger than @xmath62 as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . this seems to be explained by strong antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the strong af correlation limit the energy to remove ( add ) an electron is expected to be @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) at half filling . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath81 is the atomic level and @xmath82 is the super exchange interaction constant ( @xmath83 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the splitting is given by @xmath84 instead of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the former yields 17.4 for @xmath62 , which is comparable to the calculated splitting 20 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find sub - peaks around @xmath85 in figs . 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> these peaks are interpreted as the lower and upper hubbard peaks in the absence of long - range af correlations because the splitting is close to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find weak excitations at @xmath86 , which might correspond to a `` shadow band '' due to strong af correlations as found in qmc calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that in the nonlocal theory , the density of states at the fermi level @xmath87 does not agree with the one in the ssa as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .     densities of states in the present theory ( solid curve ) and the ssa ( dotted curve ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the nonlocal excitation spectra with increasing coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent solutions are found up to @xmath88 . in this range , we find that the quasiparticle weights @xmath89 are larger than those of the ssa but never vanish . </S>",
    "<S> we suggests that the critical coulomb interaction is @xmath90 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented a nonlocal theory for excitation spectra by introducing a fully off - diagonal effective medium @xmath91 to the projection operator formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the theory describes self - consistently the long - range nonlocal excitations in momentum space with high resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we verified from the numerical calculations that the present scheme works from the weak to strong coulomb interaction regime , and found the shadow bands as well as the hubbard sub - bands due to strong af correlations .    </S>",
