    "the remarkable success of cox s homogeneous coordinate ring in toric geometry  @xcite has stimulated many authors to study related rings for more general varieties , see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we consider here the version discussed in  @xcite : let @xmath0 be a normal variety with only constant invertible global functions and finitely generated free divisor class group @xmath1 .",
    "choose a subgroup @xmath2 of the group of weil divisors mapping isomorphically onto @xmath1 .",
    "then the modules of global sections fit together to the _ total coordinate ring _ : @xmath3    for a toric variety @xmath0 , the total coordinate ring is a polynomial ring  @xcite . in general , it turns out to be after all a factorial ring , see  @xcite and , more generally , @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of varieties @xmath0 with a finitely generated total coordinate ring .",
    "for example , finite generation of @xmath4 is known to hold for smooth fano varieties of dimension at most three  @xcite , and for smooth , unirational varieties with a complexity one group action  @xcite .    in  @xcite , keel and hu characterized , for @xmath5-factorial projective varieties @xmath0 , finite generation of @xmath4 in terms of mori theory .",
    "moreover , they observed a connection to git : if @xmath0 is @xmath5-factorial projective with @xmath4 finitely generated , then @xmath0 is the geometric quotient of a set @xmath6 of semistable points of the affine variety @xmath7 with respect to the natural action of the neron severi torus .",
    "the small modifications of @xmath0 are reflected in the associated git chamber structure , and the various cones of divisors arising in this context , like the effective cone , the closure of the ample cone , and the mori cone are all polyhedral .    in the present paper",
    ", we extend the picture developed in  @xcite to certain normal , not necessarily ( quasi)projective varieties @xmath0 .",
    "the main aim then is to provide a framework that allows explicit descriptions of geometric properties of @xmath0 in terms of combinatorial data living in the divisor class group @xmath1 .",
    "the approach generalizes the description of toric varieties in terms of `` bunches of cones '' presented in  @xcite . as we shall see",
    ", it allows a systematic treatment of many non ",
    "toric examples , and thus enlarges the `` testing ground of algebraic geometry '' provided by the toric varieties .",
    "for example , many torus quotients of grassmannians fit into our framework .",
    "we now present the results a little more in detail . similarly to  @xcite , we start with a combinatorial input datum , and then obtain a variety by means of a certain multigraded homogeneous spectrum construction .",
    "the input is what we call a _ bunched ring _ @xmath8 ; the precise definition is given in section  [ bunchedringsi ] .",
    "for the moment , it suffices to know that @xmath9 is a finitely generated factorial algebra , graded by a lattice @xmath2 , that @xmath10 is a system of @xmath2-homogeneous prime generators @xmath11 of @xmath9 , and that @xmath12 is a certain finite collection of pairwise overlapping polyhedral cones in @xmath13 , each of which is generated by the degrees of some of the @xmath14 .",
    "the basic construction then associates to the bunched ring @xmath8 a normal variety @xmath15 of dimension @xmath16 having divisor class group @xmath2 and total coordinate ring @xmath9 , see section  [ bunchedringsi ] .",
    "geometrically , @xmath0 is a good quotient space of an open subset @xmath6 of @xmath17 by the torus action arising from the @xmath2-grading .",
    "the variety @xmath0 admits embeddings into toric varieties , and thus inherits the @xmath18-property , i.e. , any pair @xmath19 has a common affine neighbourhood , compare  @xcite .",
    "in fact @xmath0 is even _",
    "@xmath20-maximal _ in the following sense : for any open embedding @xmath21 into an @xmath20-variety @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is of codimension at least two , we have @xmath24 .",
    "theorem  [ firstresult ] shows the converse :    every @xmath20-maximal ( e.g. , projective ) , normal variety with free finitely generated divisor class group and finitely generated total coordinate ring arises from a bunched ring .",
    "as indicated , a central aim is to describe geometric properties of the variety @xmath0 arising from a bunched ring @xmath8 in terms of the defining data .",
    "a first observation is that the system @xmath10 provides a stratification for the variety @xmath0 .",
    "the generators @xmath25 induce certain divisors @xmath26 , see section  [ toricambient ] , and for any face @xmath27 of the positive orthant @xmath28 , one may consider the locally closed set @xmath29    we call a face @xmath30 _ relevant _ if the corresponding @xmath31 is nonempty , and we denote the set of relevant faces by @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is stratified by the @xmath31 , where @xmath27 runs through the relevant faces",
    ". moreover , we need the linear map @xmath33 sending the canonical base vector @xmath34 to the degree of @xmath14 .",
    "a first result shows that the stratification of @xmath0 is equisingular in a raw sense , see theorem  [ singularities ] :    consider a stratum @xmath35 and a point @xmath36",
    ". then @xmath0 is @xmath5-factorial ( factorial ) at @xmath37 if and only if @xmath38 is of full dimension ( @xmath39 maps @xmath40 onto @xmath2 ) .    in general",
    ", there is no way to describe the smooth points in combinatorial terms .",
    "nevertheless , if the ring @xmath9 is `` regular enough '' in the sense that @xmath41 is smooth , then the factorial points of @xmath0 are even smooth , see proposition  [ smoothchar ] .",
    "this criterion applies to all our examples .",
    "furthermore , in this setting , the singularities of @xmath0 are at most rational .    if we pick out the set theoretically minimal cones from the relevant faces , we arrive at the _ covering collection _ @xmath42 . in terms of this covering collection ,",
    "we determine in corollary  [ picarddescr ] the picard group .    in the divisor class group @xmath43 , the picard group of @xmath0",
    "is given by @xmath44    moreover , in theorems  [ movingcone ] and  [ amplecone ] , we describe the effective cone , the moving cone , the semiample cone and , finally , the ample cone .",
    "the statement generalizes corresponding results on toric varieties , compare  @xcite and  @xcite .    in the divisor class group @xmath43",
    ", we have the following descriptions : @xmath45    an immediate application is the description of the mori cone given in corollary  [ moricone ] . as a further application , we give in section  [ kleichev ] an effective kleiman - chevalley criterion , which in the case of varieties with finitely generated coordinate ring sharpens considerations presented in  @xcite : suppose that @xmath0 is @xmath5-factorial and complete , and let @xmath46 be the rank of the divisor class group of  @xmath0",
    ". then @xmath0 is projective if and only if any @xmath46 points of @xmath0 admit a common affine neighbourhood in  @xmath0 .",
    "if the variety @xmath0 is sort of an `` intrinsic complete intersection '' , then one can determine its canonical divisor class in @xmath43 , and thus obtains fano criteria , see propositions  [ candivdescr ] and  [ fanocrit ] :    let @xmath47 , and suppose that @xmath48 are @xmath2-homogeneous generators for the relations between @xmath11",
    ". then @xmath49 is the canonical divisor class of @xmath0 in @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 is a fano variety if and only if @xmath50    the language of bunched rings can as well be used to produce and study ( new ) examples . to indicate how this may run ,",
    "we consider in section  [ intrinsic ] the case of coordinate rings defined by a single relation .",
    "in that situation , the collection of relevant faces can be easily and explicitly determined in terms of the coefficients of the defining equation .",
    "for the case of a divisor class group of rank two and coordinate rings defined by a quadric , we provide a classification extending kleinschmidt s classification of toric varieties with few invariant divisors  @xcite , see theorem  [ quadrklein ] :    the smooth intrinsic quadrics of full rank with divisor class group @xmath51 and only constant functions arise from bunched rings @xmath8 with @xmath12 given by a figure as follows :    all these varieties are projective .",
    "they are fano if and only if @xmath12 arises from a figure of the left hand side .",
    "moreover , different figures belong to non - isomorphic varieties .    in these pictures ,",
    "the thick points indicate the degrees of the generators @xmath52 ; note that these degrees may occur with multiplicity , which is indicated by the @xmath53 s .",
    "the shadowed cones are the elements of the respective `` @xmath10-bunches '' @xmath12 ; in the above situation , each of these @xmath12 consists of a single cone .",
    "the proof is elementary : it is an interplay of the combinatorics of bunches with the symmetry conditions imposed by the defining quadric .",
    "classification problems for class groups of higher rank , and defining equations of higher degree(s ) , seem to pose new , elementary , but nontrivial combinatorial challenges .    finally , we take a closer look at complete surfaces @xmath0 with finitely generated total coordinate ring @xmath54 .",
    "first we discuss general properties .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0 is already determined by @xmath9 , see proposition  [ isoring2isosurf ] .",
    "thus , in the description @xmath15 , there is a certain freedom of choice for @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is the key to the following observation , see corollary  [ surfproj ] :    let @xmath0 be a normal complete surface with free finitely generated divisor class group and finitely generated total coordinate ring . if any two non - factorial singularities of @xmath0 admit a common affine neighbourhood in @xmath0 , then @xmath0 is projective .",
    "then we consider some explicit examples , and indicate how the results presented before can be used for explicit computations .",
    "we study a certain two - dimensional mumford quotient of the grassmannian @xmath55 and determine its singularities , the picard group , the ( semi)-ample cone , and the canonical divisor .",
    "moreover , we consider the minimal resolution of the @xmath56 cubic surface , studied recently by hasset and tschinkel  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for his careful reading , and a long list of very helpful comments and valuable suggestions for improvement .",
    "the combinatorial description of toric varieties in terms of bunches presented in  @xcite is an essential ingredient of the present paper . in this section",
    "we recall the necessary concepts .",
    "it should be mentioned that we only need a special case : here the word `` bunch '' will refer to what we called in  @xcite a `` free standard bunch '' .    in the whole paper , we mean by a variety an integral scheme over an algebraically closed field @xmath57 of characteristic zero , and the word `` point '' refers to a closed point . concerning toric varieties",
