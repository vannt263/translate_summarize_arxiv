    "observed linear polarization in the light from distant stars , i.e. , often called as `` interstellar polarization '' , is interpreted as a phenomenon of dichroic extinction , and shows that interstellar grains are optically anisotropic and aligned , although the mechanism of the alignment has been still on debate ( @xcite , for a recent review ) .",
    "the alignment of grains had been explained with the paramagnetic relaxation of thermally spinning grains that obtain angular momentum by collisions with gas particles ( @xcite , hereafter dg ) .",
    "however , the dg mechanism is not efficient , and it can not explain the interstellar polarization quantitatively . for more efficient alignment , @xcite assumed a spin - up of grain by the ejection of molecular hydrogen from grain surface ( the `` pinwheel mechanism '' ) , though there still remain problems in quantitative explanations @xcite .",
    "@xcite first pointed out that irregularly shaped grains that have `` helicity '' can spin up by radiative torques ( hereafter rats ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that rats are very effective to align grains .",
    "since magnetic moments within rotating grains are induced by the barnett effect , the grains precess around the magnetic field , and the direction of alignment is usually parallel to the interstellar magnetic field ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , i.e. , the same direction as that by the dg mechanism .",
    "the alignment by rats can be more efficient if grains have superparamagnetic inclusions @xcite or if the pinwheel mechanism is working with rats @xcite .    the efficiency of the rats alignment varies with strength and spectral energy distribution of the radiation field , and thus the size of aligned grains should vary accordingly ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , the maximum wavelength @xmath8 of polarization in dark clouds was shown to be correlated with extinction @xmath9 in the v - band @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that grain alignment is enhanced by the stellar radiation in the vicinity of a young star hd 97300 in the chamaeleon i cloud .",
    "for stars in the taurus dark cloud , @xcite showed that the polarization efficiency @xmath10 in the k - band , where @xmath11 is optical depth , decreases smoothly with @xmath9 beyond the region where ice mantle feature was detected .",
    "this suggests that the alignment efficiency is not directly related to the state of grain surface , as is expected by the `` pinwheel '' alignment .",
    "those observations suggest that the rats alignment works in dark clouds and star forming regions . however , it is still not clear whether rats alignment works or not in more diffuse clouds .",
    "the pleiades cluster is associated with the diffuse reflection nebula , where grain alignment may be enhanced by strong stellar radiation if the alignment by rats works .",
    "this motivated us to observe polarization in the lines of sight to stars in the pleiades cluster with the low - dispersion spectropolarimeter hbs @xcite .",
    "in this letter , using our polarimetric data and those available from literature , we investigate correlations between polarization quantities and dust temperature , because such correlations may be expected from the rats alignment theory .",
    "we observed 8 stars in the pleiades cluster with the low - dispersion spectropolarimeter hbs @xcite attached to the 1.88 m telescope in okayama astrophysical observatory , from october 30 to november 13 in 2008 , and from january 13 to 19 in 2009 .",
    "hbs has a superachromatic half - wave plate and a quartz wollaston prism , and it can measure linear polarization over a wide range of the optical region , from 0.4 to 0.8@xmath7 .",
    "we used a slit of 0.2 mm width , yielding a wavelength resolution of @xmath12 .",
    "after binning , we have obtained spectropolarimetric data with resolution of @xmath13 , and also synthesized v - band data .",
    "a unit of the observing sequence consists of successive integrations at @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 position angles of the half - wave plate .",
    "the exposure time per object was from 1800 to 17600 sec .",
    ", depending on the brightness of object and also on weather conditions .",
    "the instrumental polarization was evaluated with nonpolarized standard stars , i.e. , hd 432 , hd 21447 , hd 95418 , hd 198149 , and hd 210027 in 2008 , and hd 21447 , hd 20630 , hd 95418 , hd 114710 and hd 142373 in 2009 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the standard deviations of the fractional stokes parameters for those standard stars were 0.02 - 0.07@xmath18 in the synthesized v - band .",
    "since these values are larger than those expected from photon noise , i.e. 0.01 - 0.03@xmath18 for each measurement , they can be interpreted as instrumental stability in polarization measurement .",
    "the photon noise for program stars was also small , @xmath19 .",
    "we thus consider that the accuracy in our polarimetry is mainly limited by the instrumental stability , and estimated the error for fractional polarization @xmath20 to be 0.04@xmath18 , which is a mean value of standard deviations for nonpolarized standard stars .",
    "the position angle @xmath21 of linear polarization in the v - band was calibrated with polarized standard stars , i.e. hd 7927 , hd 43384 , and hd 204827 in both observational runs .",
    "since hd 43384 shows small temporal variation in polarization ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we considered it as a secondary standard , though no significant deviations were found from the tabulated value of @xmath22 in literature .",
    "we thus calibrated @xmath21 with the accuracy of @xmath23    from the observation of nonpolarized standard stars through a glan - taylor prism , we estimated the instrumental depolarization to be 0.95 - 0.99 depending on wavelength , and used it for calibration .",
    "the position angle @xmath24 in wavelength @xmath25 was calibrated with reference to @xmath21 , with the same observation .",
    "the observed fractional polarization @xmath1 and position angle @xmath26 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] , except for hd 23985 and hd 24118 which show low polarization @xmath27 .",
    "we assume an empirical formula for @xmath1 by @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is maximum polarization , @xmath30 is a parameter that determines width of the curve , and @xmath8 is the wavelength at @xmath31 .",
    "those derived values of @xmath29 , @xmath8 , and @xmath30 are tabulated in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig1]a shows that @xmath1 is well expressed with equation ( [ eq_ser ] ) .",
    "the position angle @xmath26 is almost constant , though @xmath26 of 19 tau varies with @xmath3 in short wavelength @xmath32 ( figure [ fig1]b ) .",

    "we thus expect that the effect of the nebulosity is subtracted with the sky background in the reduction process .",
    "in addition , the spectral types of the stars are normal . thus the observed polarization is expected to be mainly foreground interstellar in origin .",
    "nevertheless , 19 tau may have a component of non - interstellar origin , because the position angle is variable : @xmath21 was @xmath55 in @xcite and in @xcite , but it is @xmath56 in our observation ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we thus exclude 19 tau in the following discussion .",
    "the @xmath9-dependence of @xmath8 in dark clouds suggests that the alignment of grains is induced by rats ( see section 1 ) .",
    "however , @xcite noticed that the extrapolated value of @xmath8 at @xmath57 in each cloud is correlated with the mean value of the ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath33 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the color excess for @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath33 characterizes the extinction , this correlation means that @xmath8 depends not only on the alignment , but also on the size of total , i.e. aligned and nonaligned , grains .",
    "we thus use another quantity less affected by the variation of grain size .    compared with @xmath8",
    ", the polarization efficiency @xmath61 should be less dependent on the variation of grain size , because such variation will be canceled in @xmath61 .",
    "we thus explore the observed properties of @xmath61 , expecting to obtain information on alignment",

    "it would be possible to examine the properties of @xmath61 in more detail with using light scattering calculations ( e.g. matsumura & seki 1991 , 1996 ; @xcite ) , but it is beyond the scope of this letter .",

    "the values of @xmath9 and @xmath33 are calculated by the formulae @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite , respectively , where @xmath66 is the color excess for @xmath67 .",

    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for the intrinsic colors of @xmath60 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "since the errors of @xmath33 derived with method 1 are large for some stars ( table [ tab1 ] ) , we also use another method as below ( method 2 ) .",

    "we explore not only the pleiades stars , but also the stars for which polarization and extinction data are available from literature .",
    "we have used the polarimetric data of various stars by weitenbeck ( 1999 , 2004 ) .",

    "the correlations between @xmath6 and @xmath35 are much better , i.e. , @xmath77 ( method 1 , figure [ fig3]b ) and @xmath78 ( method 2 , figure [ fig3]c ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the relative positions of hd 210121 and hd 38087 are different between in figure [ fig3]a and in figure [ fig3]bc .",

    "we finally discuss the above mentioned correlations on the basis of the rats alignment theory . using their equation ( 5 ) in @xcite and equation ( 67 ) in @xcite , with typical values for physical quantities in interstellar space tabulated in table 2 of @xcite , we can express the smallest size @xmath82 of aligned grains as @xmath83 where we assume that the efficiency @xmath84 for rats is 0.1 , and that the emissivity of grains is @xmath85 .    on the size distribution of aligned grains",
