    "the theoretical model in this perspective was proposed by bin and zhang    @xcite .",
    "this model allows analyzing the impact of managerial decisions on the behavior of members of a group towards work  measured by specific indicator of loyalty to the group ( in accordance with the general sociological message that a group loyal to each other is effective in achieving the objectives ) .",
    "the authors assume , in accordance with the theory of ` social exchange ' , that people are motivated by a desire for social status and respect as much as they are motivated by gains that are material and/or monetary .",
    "they introduce , by splitting the group members into ` economic beings ' and ` social beings ' , the possibility to analyze management policy , which consists of incentives of economic and/or social nature .",
    "the direction of movement depends on the assumed policy and the type of agent ( a social agent is attracted by social incentives , and economic agent by material ones ) .",
    "the simulation finishes with a state of equilibrium , and the evaluation of the applied policy consists of determining indicator loyalty value for a group for this state .",
    "another , more complex approach is presented in the work of shengping and bin    @xcite .",
    "the proposed model takes into account the types of work performed by a group of employees .",

    "simulated at each step , the overall ` state behavior ' of the group , is therefore a function of many factors including his / her behavior in last time step , his / her neighbors behavior , his / her properties , characteristic and state of the work .",
    "although the precise interpretation of such a complex indicator is difficult , in general , the level of ` state behavior ' reflects the ( average ) degree of positive attitude towards work and in a broad sense can be associated with the level of loyalty , which was proposed in ref .",

    "his ability to remain ` uninfluenced ' by his coworkers was adopted .",
    "insistence takes values from one to five , where one denotes an employee who is highly influenced by his neighborhood and thus his behavior is determined by his coworkers ; five is the total resistance to the influence of neighbors . for intermediate sizes weights of impact",
    "were adopted .",
    "introduced behavioral rules allow to simulate ( in each step ) attitude change of each agent according to its attitude in the previous step , and the characteristics of its neighbors .",
    "additionally , in the model it was assumed that insistence is an adaptable trait and depends on the extent the employee is conformed to the organizational norms .",
    "organizational norms are determined by the company policy .",
    "the organization s policy is represented by the ` reward ' coefficient ( for positive behavior for agents with low insistence ) and ` punishment ' coefficient ( for negative behaviors and a large insistence ) .",
    "overall assessment of the behavior of group in a given environment is the average ` loyalty factor ' .",
    "the main use of the model is to analyze the behavior of the tested group of workers ( mainly by a loyalty factor ) in the conditions of use of different combinations of reward and punishment levels .    the general idea of the analysis of key factors and relationships in the term ` human and work ' and the ability to simulate specific managerial decision",
    "is also used in the proposed model in this article .",
    "loyalty is measured by the number of agents who carry out their tasks , and the lack of loyalty is expressed by the number of agents , who give their tasks to other agents .",

    "more exactly , the stream of incoming tasks is the product @xmath98 , where @xmath14 is the number of incoming tasks assigned to an agent .",
    "we could expect that the amount of agents should be a function of this product .",
    "instead , what we observe is that the amount of agents increases with @xmath14 but remains stable with @xmath13 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - egoists - k ] .",
    "this puzzle remains to be solved .",
    "a plausible hypothesis is that some amount of unloyal agents is functional as they help to transport tasks throughout the system , making the spatial distribution of tasks more homogeneous .",
    "four tasks can be performed by four loyal neighbors in one time step , not in four steps . within the range of parameters where",
    "the stability is observed , the problem of overload is maybe solved locally . yet",
    ", this hypothesis waits for a confirmation with dedicated numerical tools , as the local correlation functions of the task density .",
    "the third issue is connected with ambiguous role of parameter @xmath18 .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect scenario presented in figs .",
    "[ fig - egoists - r ] and [ fig - tasks - r ] , _ i.e. _ when increasing of the threshold value @xmath18 after which agents become unloyal group members helps system in staying in ` making - it ' phase .",
    "however , this natural system response to increasing @xmath18 is absent when rule [ eq : step6](b ) is applied . yet , for the variant [ eq : step6](b ) , the overall amount of agents is much smaller .",
    "perhaps a weak increase of @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] with @xmath18 is related to a longer lifetime of an agent , who has to shift more tasks ( @xmath99 ) to be converted to an agent again .",
    "anyway , this increase seems to be a second - order effect . on the other hand for this rule when scanning @xmath18 parameter we do not observe a ` jammed ' phase on @xmath86 hyper - plane [ see figs .",
    "[ fig - egoists - r - hrt ] , [ fig - tasks - r - hrt ] and tab .  [ tab - xc ] ] .",
    "from the perspective of social simulation , the model and results reported above fall into the category of yawotas ( ` yet another way of thinking about stuff ' ) , _ i.e. _ of analogical models rather than explanatory or predictive ones @xcite . yet",
    ", this category is shared with most applications based on the technique of . according to classic textbooks on social sciences @xcite ,",
    "our research can be classified as an exploration ; here it deals with mathematical aspects of performance of groups of workers .",
    "our results suggest that the regime where their work is efficient can be stabilized by a tuning of the system parameters .",
    "also we hope that the memory effect captured by hysteretic rules can be inspiring when looking solutions to other problems , even so elusive as those met in social sciences . @xcite .",
