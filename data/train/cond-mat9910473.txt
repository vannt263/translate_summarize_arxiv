    "the nucleation of superconductivity in mesoscopic samples has received a renewed interest after the development of nanofabrication techniques , like electron beam lithography .",
    "a superconductor is in the mesoscopic regime when the sample size is comparable to the superconducting coherence length @xmath2 . in the framework of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory ,",
    "@xmath2 sets the length scale for spatial variations of the modulus of the superconducting order parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the pioneering work on mesoscopic superconductors was carried out already in 1962 by little and parks  @xcite , who measured the shift of the critical temperature @xmath1 of a ( multiply connected ) thin - walled sn microcylinder ( a thin - wire `` loop '' ) in an axial magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath1 phase boundary showed a periodic component , with the magnetic period corresponding to the penetration of a superconducting flux quantum @xmath5 .",
    "a few years later , saint - james calculated the @xmath1 of a singly - connected cylinder  @xcite ( a mesoscopic `` disk '' ) .",
    "taking into account the analogy with the situation of a semi - infinite superconducting slab in contact with vacuum  @xcite , the critical field was called @xmath6 in this case , since superconductivity nucleates initially _ near the sample interface_. in the present paper , we will use the notation @xmath7 , for the nucleation magnetic field .    the @xmath1 phase boundary ( or @xmath7 ) of the disk shows , just like for the usual little - parks  effect in a multiply connected sample ( loop ) , an oscillatory behaviour .",
    "when moving along @xmath1 , superconductivity concentrates more and more near the sample interface as @xmath4 grows .",
    "a giant vortex state is formed : a `` normal '' core carries @xmath8 flux quanta , and the effective loop radius increases , resulting in a decrease of the magnetic oscillation period .",
    "an experimental verification of these predictions was carried out later on by buisson _",

    "gennes  @xcite , @xmath7 has been calculated also for a _ film exposed to a parallel magnetic field _ , where surface superconductivity can grow along two superconductor / vacuum interfaces . for low magnetic fields , the two surface superconducting sheaths overlap , and , as a result ,",
    "@xmath0 versus @xmath4 becomes parabolic , which is characteristic for 2d behaviour .",
    "when increasing the field , a crossover to a linear @xmath1 dependence ( 3d ) occurs at @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the film thickness . shortly after , it was shown that vortices start to nucleate in the film at this dimensional crossover point ( @xmath11 )  @xcite .    the goal of the present paper is to study the phase boundary @xmath1 of loops made of finite width wires . in a type - ii material",
    ", superconductivity is expected to be enhanced , with respect to the bulk upper critical field @xmath12  :  @xmath13 , both at the external and the internal sample surfaces . as for a film in a parallel field ,",
    "a 2d-3d dimensional crossover can be anticipated , since the loops may be simply considered as a film , which is bent such that its ends are joined together .",
    "we calculate , for the first time , the phase boundary @xmath1 as the ground state solution of the linearized first gl  equation with two superconductor / vacuum interfaces .",
    "the linearized first gl equation to be solved in order to find @xmath1 is : @xmath14 this equation is formally identical to the schrdinger equation for a particle with a charge @xmath15 in a magnetic field . at the onset of superconductivity ,",
    "the nonlinear gl term can be omitted and the @xmath16-dependence disappears from the equations and therefore an infinitely long cylinder and a disk have identical @xmath1 boundaries .",
    "it is further assumed that @xmath17 , with @xmath4 the _ applied magnetic field_. the eigenenergies @xmath18 can be written as : @xmath19 @xmath20 being the critical temperature in zero magnetic field . from the energy eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ glfree1 ] ) , the lowest landau level @xmath21 is directly related to the highest possible temperature @xmath1 , for which superconductivity can exist .    for the loop geometries , we choose the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath22 and the gauge @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the tangential unit vector .",
    "the exact solution of the hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ glfree1 ] ) ) in cylindrical coordinates takes the following form  @xcite : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the applied magnetic flux through a circle of radius @xmath27 .",
    "the number @xmath28 determines the energy eigenvalue .",
    "most generally , the function @xmath29 can be any linear combination of the two confluent hypergeometric functions ( or kummer functions ) @xmath30 and @xmath31  @xcite , but the sample topology puts a constraint on @xmath32 , and @xmath28 , via the neumann boundary condition : @xmath33 which the solutions @xmath34 of eq .",

    "( [ psikummer ] ) in order to avoid the divergency of @xmath42 at the origin . selecting the lowest landau level at each value @xmath43",

    "the system makes a transition @xmath48 , i.e. a flux quantum enters or is removed from the sample .",
    "the loops we are currently studying have two superconducting / vacuum interfaces , one at the outer radius @xmath49 , and one at the inner radius @xmath50 . consequently , the boundary condition ( eq .  ( [ glbound ] ) )",
    "has to be fulfilled at both @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . as a result",
    ", we have a system of two equations and two variables @xmath28 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is chosen ) , which we solved for different values of @xmath53 .",

    "the background depression of @xmath0 is _ parabolic _ , whereas at higher flux , @xmath47 becomes _ quasi - linear _ , just like for the case of a filled disk . the crossover point from parabolic to quasi - linear appears at about @xmath57 .",
    "the solid and dotted straight lines in fig .  [ elevels ] are the bulk upper critical field @xmath58 and the surface critical field @xmath6 for a semi - infinite slab , respectively . in these units",
    "the slopes of the curves ( see eq .",
    "( [ hcscaled ] ) ) are @xmath59 for @xmath12 ( substitute @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ hcscaled ] ) ) and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "the ratio @xmath62 corresponds then to the enhancement factor @xmath63 at a constant temperature . for the loops we are studying here ,",
    "@xmath64 is varying as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the energy levels below the @xmath12 line ( solid straight line in fig .",
    "[ elevels ] ) could be found by fixing a certain @xmath8 , and finding the real numbers @xmath44 numerically after inserting the general solution ( eq .  ( [ psikummer ] ) ) into the boundary condition ( eq .  ( [ glbound ] ) ) .",
    "note that the lowest landau level always has a lower energy @xmath65 than for a semi - infinite superconducting slab , which implies @xmath66 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in a thin film of thickness @xmath10 in a parallel field @xmath4 , a dimensional crossover is found at @xmath67 . for low fields ( high @xmath68 ) @xmath1 is parabolic ( 2d ) , and for higher fields vortices start penetrating the film and consequently @xmath1 becomes linear ( 3d )  @xcite . in fig .  [ elevels ]",
    "the small arrow indicates the point on the phase diagram @xmath47 where @xmath69 . for the loops",
    "as well , the dimensional transition shows up approximately at this point , although the vortices are not penetrating the sample area in the 3d regime .",
    "instead , the middle loop opening contains a coreless giant vortex with an integer number of flux quanta @xmath70 .    in order to compare the flux periodicity of @xmath47 , we have plotted , in fig .",

    "the nucleation field of a disk @xmath73 , and for a circular microhole in an infinite film ( `` antidot '' )  @xcite @xmath74 .",
    "as @xmath43 grows ( the radius goes to infinity ) the @xmath7 of both the disk and the antidot approaches the @xmath6 line .",
    "for all the loops we study here , the presence of the outer sample interface automatically implies that @xmath75 is enhanced ( @xmath76 ) , with respect to the case of a flat superconductor - vacuum interface . for loops with a small @xmath53 ,",
    "the @xmath47 boundary very rapidly collapses with the @xmath47 of the dot ( @xmath77 becomes the same ) .",
    "the presence of the opening in the sample is not relevant for the giant vortex formation in the high flux 3d regime . on the contrary , in the low flux regime",
    ", the surface sheaths along the two interfaces overlap , giving rise to a different periodicity of @xmath47 and to a parabolic background .",
    "this regime can be described within the london limit@xcite , since superconductivity nucleates almost uniformly within the sample .    in summary , we have solved the linearized gl  equation for loops of different wire width , with neumann boundary conditions at both the outer and the inner loop radius .",
    "the critical fields @xmath7 are always above the @xmath78 .",
    "the ratio @xmath79 is enhanced most strongly when the sample s surface - to - volume ratio is the largest .",
    "the @xmath47 behaviour can be split in two regimes : for low flux , the background of @xmath0 is parabolic ( characteristic for 2d behaviour ) and the little - parks @xmath47 oscillations are perfectly periodic . in the high flux regime , the period of the @xmath47 oscillations is decreasing with @xmath43 and the background @xmath0 reduction is quasi - linear ( 3d regime ) . the 2d-3d crossover between the two regimes , at a certain applied flux @xmath43 , is similar to the dimensional transition in thin films subjected to a parallel field . as soon the 3d regime is reached , a giant vortex state is created , where only a sheath close to the sample s outer interface is superconducting",
