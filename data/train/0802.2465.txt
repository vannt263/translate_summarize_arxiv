    "symbolic dynamics for the planar three - body problem is not yet fully developed .",
    "not many authors are involved in this direction ( chernin et al . 2006 ; myllari 2007 ; moeckel 2007 ) .",
    "we need to find a good procedure to assign symbols comparable to the one - dimensional case ( tanikawa & mikkola 2000 ) .    in the free - fall three - body problem",
    ", we saw that binary collision curves ( formed with initial condition points of orbits which experience collision ) constitute the boundary of regions in the initial value plane ( tanikawa & umehara , 1998 ) .",
    "we expect this may be the case also for the case with angular momentum . in the present report , we introduce symbols so that the boundaries of different symbol sequences are binary collsion curves . after the definition of symbols , we start numerical symbolic dynamics of the planar three - body problem with angular momentum extending the free - fall problem .",
    "we introduce symbols in this section .",
    "first , we define the signed area of the triangle formed with three bodies .",
    "if the three bodies are arranged in the counter - clockwise order for body numbers 1 , 2 , and 3 , we consider that the area is positive ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . if the order is reverse , the area is considered to be negative .",
    "the absolute value of the area of the triangle is its usual area .    using this definition of area , we assign a symbol to a particular event on the orbits .",
    "suppose that the configuration of the three bodies becomes collinear .",
    "if the angular momentum of the system is not zero , this configuration can not be maintained for a finite non - zero time interval except the rectilinear case of the three - body problem .",
    "before and after this configuration , triangles of non - zero area are recovered .",
    "we ask here whether the middle particle may cross or only be tangent to the syzygy line .",
    "the latter does not happen since otherwise the trajectory of the middle body is convex to the remaining two bodies when it is on the syzygy .",
    "this is impossible because the trajectory of any body should be concave to either or both of the remaining bodies due to the gravitational attraction .",
    "we need to consider the case of binary collision . at binary collision ,",
    "the configuration becomes collinear .",
    "as is well - known , the trajectory of a body relative to the other body is a parabola in the vicinity of binary collision .",
    "the third body can be considered to be stand still compared with the high speed of the binary components .",
    "this again shows that the collinear configuration can not be maintained before and after collision .",
    "finally we need to make an important remark . at binary collision , an orbit experiences syzygy crossings not only once .",
    "the orbit may experience at most three syzygy crossings .",
    "in addition , the number of crossings is different depending on whether the collision is considered as a limit of retrograde encounter or prograde encounter .",
    "the limit should be taken to keep the continuity to the neighboring initial conditions .",
    "the analysis of collision will be given elsewhere .",
    "we here make a notice that two or three symbols may be given to the orbit at collision .    now , suppose that the area changes sign from @xmath1 to @xmath2 at some instant",
    ". then we give symbol 1 if the longest edge is 23 , that is , the edge connecting body2 and body 3 .",
    "simlarly , we give symbol 2 if the longest edge is 31 , and we give symbol 3 if the longest edge is 12 . when the area changes sign from @xmath2 to @xmath1 , we give symbol 4 if the longest edge is 23",
    "simlarly , we give symbol 5 if the longest edge is 31 , and we give symbol 6 if the longest edge is 12 .",
    "[ symbolass ]",
    "each time a triple system becomes collinear , a symol is given according to the rule described in the preceding section except at collision .",
    "therefore , an orbit represented by a continuous curve in the phase space is replaced by a bi - infinite symbol sequence . here",
    "we only consider the future symbol sequence .",
    "we denote the present by a point , and symbols by @xmath4 , then a symbol sequence @xmath5 can be written as @xmath6      let us briefly explain the initial conditions of numerical integrations .",
    "we want to extend the free fall problem with equal masses ( anosova & orlov 1986 ; tanikawa et al . 1995 ) , in which bodies 2 and 3 initially stand still at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , whereas body 1 stands still at @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is called the initial condition plane ( fig .",
    "3 ) . if the body 1 moves everywhere in @xmath10 , all the possible triangles are realized .",
    "now , we give velocities to the bodies and angular momentum to the system still with equal masses . in the planar three - body problem with angular momentum , there too many degrees of freedom .",
    "we need somehow to restrict the initial condition space so as to be able to express the numerical results visibly . here , we give maximal angular momentum for a given configuration triangle ( see kuwabara & tanikawa , this isuue ) . in this case ,",
    "one of the symmetries is lost , so the initial condition space becomes doubled .",
    "see the right panel of fig .",
    "this time @xmath11 is the initial condition plane ( tanikawa & kuwabara 2007 ) .    [ geomerty ]      now , suppose that all the points in the initial condition space have their own symbol sequences ( 1 ) , that is , the orbits starting at points of the initial condition space are all integrated .",
    "if we truncate symbol sequences at the @xmath12-th digit , there are finite number of possible combinations of symbols in these length-@xmath12 `` words '' .",
    "the initial condition space is divided by `` cylinders '' which contain these words .",
    "we ask what kind of points , or equivalently , orbits , constitute these boundaries .    for simplicity of discussion ,",
    "let us consider the case @xmath13 , the first digit .",
    "it is apparaent from fig .",
    "4 that initial tirangles have positive areas , so only 1 , 2 , and 3 appear at the first syzygy crossing .",
    "these three symbols divide the initial condition space .",
    "suppose the region where the first digit is 1. take orbit @xmath14 in which body 1 crosses the syzygy between bodies 2 and 3 and at finite non - zero distances both from bodies 2 and 3 .",
    "then , all neighboring orbits also experience syzygy crossing of body 1 bewteen bodies 2 and 3 .",
    "this means that orbit @xmath14 is inside the region occupied by symbol 1 which we call region 1 .",
    "this argument applies as long as body 1 crosses the syzygy at finite distances from both bodies 2 and 3 .",
    "orbits of the boundaries of region 1 should be collision orbits",
    ". there can be two boundaries : between regions 1 and 2 and between regions 1 and 3. similarly , there can be two boundaries of region 2 , and two boundaries of region 3. in general , there are six symbols .",
    "so , the boundaries of region @xmath0 ( @xmath15 ) can be more than two .",
    "[ triangle - init ]",
    "in order to justify the argument of  3.2 , we first give results on the free - fall problem ( tanikawa & umehara 1998 ) . figure 5 shows how the initial condition plane is divided by collision curves .",
    "it is to be noted that the boundaries of the plane , the @xmath16-axis , @xmath17-axis , and the circular boundary are all collision curves .",
    "our numerical results are shown in fig.6 . in the free - fall case",
    ", body 1 passes through between bodies 2 and 3 at the first syzygy crossing .",
    "so the whole space is occupied by region 1. the initial condition space divided by 15 and 16 at the first two digits .",
    "the reason is simple . at the right part of the space , bodies 1 and 3 form",
    "a binary , so body 3 passes through between bodies 1 and 2 , and the vectorial area goes from - to + , giving symbol 6. at the right part , body 2 passes through the syzygy , giving symbol 5. the boundary of two regions is the @xmath17-axis .",
    "this is seen in the figure of the left panel of fig .",
    "6 . in the lower - left and lower - right corners of the figure ,",
    "some different colors are seen .",
    "these are considered to be numerical artifacts .",
    "[ free - fall ]    in the middle panel of fig .",
    "3 , the initial plane is divided by regions with the first three digits of symbol sequences .",
    "here we have a new result .",
    "the boundary of yellow and orange regions corresponds to the binary collision curve ( broken curve ) of type 3 ( tanikawa et al .",
    "1995 ) emanating from point @xmath18 in fig .",
    "5 . in tanikawa",
    "( 1995 ) , we could not follow the collision curve down to the @xmath16-axis due to numerical difficulty . in the present work",
    ", it has been shown that the collision curve actually arrive at the @xmath16-axis .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "3 , the results for the first four digits are shown .",
    "new collision curves appear .",
    "one is the boundary between light blue and pink regions .",
    "this is the collision curve of type 1 emanating from @xmath18 .",
    "the other two curves between yellow and green regions are a collision curve emanating from @xmath19 and a curve of type 2 starting at the middle of @xmath20 and @xmath19 in fig .",
    "5 .      in the preceding secion",
    ", we have numerically shown that the boundaries of regions with different cylinders are formed with binary collision curves . in this section ,",
    "let us look at the initial condition plane from a different view point .",
    "we gradually add angular momentum to triple systems .",
    "the parameter is the virial coefficient @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the kinetic energy and @xmath23 is the potential energy of a triple system .",
    "as @xmath24 increases from 0 , the contibution of velocities increases relative to a fixed potential energy . at @xmath25 ,",
    "the energy of the triple system is equal to zero .",
    "so we consider the range @xmath26 .    in this report",
    ", we consider only the boundaries of the cylinders of the first one word as a function of @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "7 , results are given for @xmath27 ( top ) , @xmath28 ( second top ) , @xmath29 ( third top ) , and @xmath30 ( bottom ) .",
    "red is for symbol 1 , green is for symbol 2 , and blue is for symbol 3.    as mentioned before , the whole plane is occupied by region 1 for @xmath31 . even for a very small @xmath32 ,",
    "region 2 appears ( top - right figure ) .",
    "this is because near the left boundary of the plane bodies 1 and 2 form a binary , and even for a small angular momentum , this binary revolves each other , hence body 2 instead of body 1 experiences the first syzygy crossing .",
    "the boundary of two regions is formed with a binary collision curve of type 3 ( collision bewteen bodies 1 and 2 ) .",
    "it seems that this curve extends from the center bottom ( the euler point ) to the top ( the lagrange point ) .    as @xmath24 increases , the boundary collision curve deforms and evolves to the right in the initial condition space ( see the second top figures of fig .",
    "7 ) . near the top of the plane",
    ", region 3 appears . though this region is visible only for @xmath33 in fig .",
    "7 , the region is visible for @xmath34 if we enlarge the neighborhood of the lagrange point .",
    "in addition , the binary collision curve seems to spiral into the lagrange point as long as the point is unstable ( see fig . 8) .",
    "we have demonstrated that symbolic dynamics is effective in the planar three - body problem .",
    "main results are    \\(i ) in the free - fall problem , it has been shown that binary collision curves divide the initial condition space .",
    "this has been suggested in tanikawa et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in the present work ,",
    "divisions are more clearly seen .",
    "\\(ii ) it has been shown for the three - body problem with angular momentum that a binary collision curve connects the euler point and lagrange point in the initial condition plane , which suggests that the euler and lagrange points are connectd by an invarian manifold .",
    "the collision curve seems to spiral into the lagrange point if the angular momentum is not zero .",
    "this project was sipported by jsps and rfbr under the japan ",
    "russia research coorperative program .",
