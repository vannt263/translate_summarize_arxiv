    "dwarf galaxies ( m@xmath14 ) are the most abundant class of galaxies in the universe .",
    "they occupy an important part of parameter space for understanding the feedback processes that seem to govern the relationships between dark halo mass , baryon fraction , and star formation efficiency .",
    "furthermore , their progenitors at high redshift may have played an important role in reionizing the universe @xcite .",
    "despite the ubiquity of dwarf galaxies , it is challenging to reliably measure their physical properties and put them in their appropriate cosmological context ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "most dwarf galaxies are undetectable beyond redshift @xmath15 @xmath212 , even in the hubble ultra deep field or with planned jwst observations @xcite .",
    "thus , observations of local group galaxies have set the benchmark for the accuracy and precision with which ancient star formation rates and chemical evolution histories can be measured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "long - lived main - sequence stars born at lookback times @xmath1610  gyr , corresponding to @xmath15 @xmath17 2 , are a direct probe of galaxy evolution in the universe from the earliest star - forming period , through the epoch of reionization and its aftermath .    in this paper",
    "we present a photometric analysis of the understudied star cluster at the center of ddo  216 ( the pegasus dwarf irregular , pegdig , ugc  12613 ) , which we observed serendipitously during our hst program to measure the complete star formation history of this galaxy .",
    "pegdig ( m@xmath18 = @xmath012.5 @xmath10.2 ) is roughly a magnitude fainter than the fornax and sagittarius dwarfs , which makes it one of the least luminous galaxies known to host a cluster near the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for examples of similar clusters in dwarfs with m@xmath18 @xmath1911.5 ) .",
    "first , we review the basic parameters of the galaxy , and then describe our observations and reductions in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "our analysis of the structure and content of the star cluster ddo216-a1 , including age and metallicity estimates based on the color - magnitude diagram and an analysis of the variable star population of the cluster , is given in section  [ sec : clus ] .",
    "we place ddo216-a1 in context with the population of massive star clusters in dwarf galaxies and summarise our results in section  [ sec : summ ] .",
    "given deep enough observations , it is relatively straightforward to derive star formation rates at high lookback times for galaxies within the local group . it is more difficult to identify the triggers of star formation .",
    "for example , the majority of dwarf - dwarf major mergers are expected to have occured in the first few billion years after galaxy formation began ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but because of the destructive nature of mergers most of the obvious evidence for merger activity will have long since vanished .",
    "globular clusters are an important window into this process because they require extreme conditions to form , suggestive of vigorous star formation in the mode often associated with galaxy mergers and interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "globular clusters are tightly bound and will typically survive for a hubble time unless disrupted in a hostile tidal environment , but the relatively shallow potential wells of dwarf galaxies are not generally conducive to cluster disruption .",
    "the globular cluster populations of dwarf galaxies are thus an object of strong interest for the study of the early evolution of these systems and for attempts to gauge the importance of various modes of star formation in small galaxies . with the ability of hst imaging to differentiate between star clusters , background galaxies , and density variations in field populations ,",
    "there has been renewed attention to the study of globular clusters in extragalactic systems in recent decades .    as a result , many globular and open clusters are known in dwarf galaxies in the local group and beyond , in enough numbers to make statistical associations between properties like host galaxy morphology and cluster colours and sizes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these span a range of sizes from extremely luminous and dense nuclear star clusters to low - mass open cluster or association analogues , in galaxies down to some of the least luminous known .    in the local group , recent",
    "work has discovered examples of modest star clusters even among the smallest galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and more massive , sometimes extended clusters in some of the larger irregular galaxies @xcite . in light of these discoveries and others , @xcite have suggested that some of the outer halo globular clusters thought to be galactic globular clusters may in fact be hosted by undiscovered low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "however , the lowest - luminosity local group galaxies with catalogued globular clusters similar to the massive and dense globulars of the milky way are fornax and sagittarius ( m@xmath18 = @xmath013.4 and @xmath2013.5 , respectively ) .",
    "the pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy , pegdig , was discovered by a.g .",
    "wilson in the early 1950 s on palomar schmidt plates @xcite . from early on it was considered to be a candidate member of the local group with a distance of @xmath111  mpc .",
    "the case for membership was supported by the negative heliocentric radial velocity found by @xcite .",
    "pegdig is considered a distant m31 satellite ( d@xmath21 @xmath2470  kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is not proven that it has ever interacted with m31 , although it is more likely than not that pegdig has previously been within m31 s virial radius @xcite .",

    "@xcite drew attention to the cometary appearance of the neutral gas , and attributed the asymmetric morphology to ram pressure stripping by diffuse gas in the local group , although this conclusion is disputed , based on much deeper hi observations , by @xcite .",

    ", pegdig appears to have more in common with the dirr galaxies than with a typical dsph , consistent with its retention of neutral gas to the present day and with the assertion of @xcite that transition type galaxies represent the low - mass / low - sfr end of the dwarf irregular population ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the observations , which comprise 34.3 and 37.4 kiloseconds in the f814w ( broad i band ) and f475w ( sloan @xmath25 band ) filters respectively , were made between 2326 july , 2015 .",

    "stars that were found to suffer from excessive crowding noise ( crowding parameter @xmath271.0 ) due to partially resolved bright neighbors were rejected , leaving a sample of 247,390 well - measured stars with s / n @xmath165 .",
    "we performed an artificial star test analysis with 50,000 stars , distributed following the cluster light within 10@xmath28 of the cluster center , in order to characterize the measurement errors and incompleteness .",
    "the 50% completeness limits are ( m@xmath29 , m@xmath5 ) = ( 28.3 , 27.4 ) ; this does not reach the cluster msto due to crowding , although the oldest msto is reached for the field population . at these magnitude levels",

    "the field population is patchy and irregular , with evidence for differential reddening and an increase in the density of bright , blue stars towards the upper right .",
    "the cluster appears to be around 810  arcseconds ( 3544  pc ) in diameter , and is nearly circular in projection .",
    "ddo216-a1 is neither notably blue nor red compared to its surroundings .",
    "the neutral color indicates immediately that the cluster light is dominated by first - ascent red giant branch stars , and not young main - sequence stars or asymptotic giant branch stars .",

    "we present a cmd of the central 1 arcminute of the galaxy ( including the cluster ) in figure  [ fig - cmd ] to highlight the differences between the galaxy field and the cluster . compared to its surroundings",
    ", the cluster suffers from a much higher degree of crowding , but is still complete to more than two magnitudes below the level of the horizontal branch .",
    "a 30  myr parsec isochrone @xcite chosen to approximately match the mean metallicity of pegdig ( z = 0.001 ) has been overlaid on the field cmd to indicate the distance , 900 @xmath130  kpc , and reddening , e(b@xmath0v ) = 0.16 @xmath10.02  mag to the galaxy ( see below ) .",
    "the field stars contain a strong population of red clump stars , a relatively broad red giant branch , and main sequence that is well - populated across a wide range of magnitudes , indicating a wide range of stellar ages .",
    "the cluster shows no enhancement in density of red clump stars , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , or upper main sequence stars compared to the field , but shows a well - populated horizontal branch ( hb ) and red giant branch ( rgb ) , with a mostly red horizontal branch morphology .",
    "the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) of the cluster is not obvious due to the increased crowding ; if the cluster were younger than @xmath278  gyr we would see its msto above the crowding limit of the data .",
    "the tip of the red giant branch in the cluster terminates at m814w @xmath221 , very similar to that of the field .",
    "the first ccd images of pegdig were obtained by @xcite , who noted three star cluster candidates and also commented on the high number of background galaxies visible around and through the galaxy .",
    "indeed , pegdig is not far from the supergalactic plane ; it appears in projection on the sky in the foreground of a galaxy group in the outskirts of the pegasus cluster ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite listed their star cluster candidates as a13 ; the potential for naming confusion with the pegasus cluster of galaxies leads us to adopt hoessel & mould s nomenclature for the central star cluster in ddo216 , which we hereafter refer to as ddo216-a1 .",
    "@xcite report the magnitude and color for cluster a1 , in the thuan - gunn system , as @xmath30 = 18.75 and @xmath31 = 0.45 , and estimate its age to be @xmath17  2  gyr from the integrated color .",
    "the first hubble space telescope observations of pegdig were reported by @xcite , who placed the wfpc2 camera in the central parts of the galaxy such that the pc chip barely included the outskirts of ddo216-a1 .",
    "the cluster is also clearly identifiable in their 06-seeing wiyn  3.5 m telelecope images .",
    "these authors note that the cluster is only moderately dense , with a rather large diameter of @xmath240  pc , and that although it is located very centrally within pegdig it falls well short of being a galaxy nucleus or super star cluster @xcite .",
    "the shallowness of their cmds and the positioning of the cluster mainly outside the wfpc2 field prevented any further quantitative work although they confirm the claim of @xcite that the cluster is most likely older than 2  gyr , based on its lack of bright main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "subsequently the cluster appears to have been lost to the literature , failing to be included in compilations of the properties of local group galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , papers specifically devoted to the statistics of star clusters in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "given the recent surge in interest in the nature of extended star clusters in dwarf galaxies and in the physical differences between clusters and galaxies , the presence of an understudied , luminous , high surface brightness star cluster at the very center of one of the local group s faintest photographically discovered galaxies is remarkable .",
    "ddo216-a1 is located at right ascension 23:28:26.3 , declination @xmath3214:44:25.2 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "this is just 6@xmath28 ( 26 pc ) south of the center of the outer red light isophotes of pegdig as measured by @xcite .",
    "the cluster is of high surface brightness and has a very distinctly identifiable core , but determination of the cluster properties is complicated by the fact that it is embedded in the highest surface brightness part of pegdig , and by the fact that significant differential reddening appears to be present .",
    "the differential reddening can be seen both in the color spread of red giants and upper main sequence stars , and in the presence of dust lanes in the false color acs / wfc images .",
    "ddo216-a1 is nearly circular ; using the iraf _ stsdas _ task _ ellipse _ , we find an ellipticity @xmath33 @xmath34 ( 1@xmath35 ) @xmath360.15 .",
    "we calculated the half - light radius of the cluster using star counts of horizontal branch stars .",
    "the pegdig field has a compound hb morphology , with both red and blue hb stars present , spread nearly evenly across the acs / wfc field .",
    "the cluster core , within 40 pixels of the center , has roughly an order of magnitude higher surface density of hb stars , so these make a convenient measure for estimating the cluster extent with the minimum field contamination .    in a region from 1215@xmath28 outside the cluster , the density of hb stars is 0.14 arcsec@xmath3 .",
    "the hb density rises to twice this value at a radius of 8@xmath45 from the cluster center , which we take to be the area over which the cluster is clearly dominant over the field . within this 8@xmath45 ( @xmath237  pc ) circle",
    ", we would expect to find 32 @xmath16 hb stars from the field population alone ; the actual cmd of this area yields 89 hb stars .",
    "subtracting the field contribution and finding the radius within which half the cluster is contained , a half - light radius of 3@xmath41 @xmath1 0@xmath37 is derived ( 13.4 @xmath1 1.3  pc ) .",
    "this result does not significantly change if the upper red giant branch stars are included , and the contamination by field stars is higher .",
    "we measured the flux in concentric apertures around the cluster , using annuli with outer radii from 0@xmath4820@xmath28 in size , and an annulus from 2530@xmath28 to measure the field contribution .",
    "we measured the f814w and f475w surface brightness profiles and found them to be consistent with the half - light radius derived from hb star counts .",
    "we merged the two bandpasses into a single profile by simultaneously fitting a king model with a common core radius r@xmath8 and concentration index @xmath9 @xmath34 log(r@xmath38/r@xmath8 ) and two central surface brightness values , one for the f814w image and one for the f475w image .",
    "the resulting fit is shown for the f814w surface brightness in figure  [ fig - profile ] .",
    "the king model core radius is r@xmath8 = 2@xmath412 @xmath1 0@xmath491 , the concentration index is @xmath9 = 1.24 @xmath10.39 , and the central surface brightnesses are @xmath39 = 20.85 @xmath10.23 and @xmath40 = 22.68 @xmath10.24 mag  arcsec@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the outer regions of the cluster are difficult to reliably measure because of the high field contamination .",
    "therefore , the total magnitude of ddo216-a1 is estimated by measuring the background - subtracted flux within the half - light radius and doubling it .",
    "the extrapolated integrated magnitudes are ( m475w , m814w ) = ( 18.64 @xmath10.07 , 17.17 @xmath10.14 ) . transformation to a standard johnson - cousins system gives ( b , i ) = ( 18.95 , 17.39 ) , and a transformed v magnitude of 18.13 .",
    "the measured total magnitude is thus in reasonable accord with the original discovery values in @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitude of ddo216-a1 is m@xmath5 = @xmath07.90 @xmath10.16 for the distance and reddening derived from our cmds of the cluster and its surrounding fields .",

    "the color b@xmath0v = 0.82 is quite red for a globular cluster , but when dereddened [ ( b@xmath0v)@xmath42 = 0.66 ] is entirely consistent with typical metal - poor globulars .      candidate variable stars were identified in the photometric catalog using the method of @xcite , as implemented and applied to _ hst _",

    "the reasons for the omission of ddo216-a1 from lists of globular clusters in dwarf galaxies probably stem from a combination of the location of ddo216-a1 , seen in projection against the densest part of pegdig ; the unusually extended nature of the cluster , which both gives it much less contrast with its surroundings and makes it somewhat unlike galactic globular clusters ; and the prevalence of background galaxies in the field . at a distance of 900  kpc",
    ", it requires diffraction limited imaging to resolve the cluster even to the level of the horizontal branch .",
    "the cluster is not prominently visible in spitzer space telesope irac images @xcite due to its lack of asymptotic giant branch stars ; with hindsight , it is obvious in sdss images , although unresolved .      in the absence of spectroscopic information , the cluster mass can only be estimated in a model - dependent way or by comparison to better - studied , similarly luminous clusters . @xcite compared the dynamical mass - to - light ratios for a large set of milky way and magellanic cloud globular clusters to predictions of population synthesis models by @xcite .",
    "using their preferred initial mass function @xcite , they found a mean model m / l @xmath21.9 for the old clusters .",
    "the median dynamical mass to light ratio for the clusters in their sample was 82@xmath17% of this value , with a substantial scatter .",
    "our absolute magnitude for ddo216-a1 is m@xmath18 = @xmath07.14 @xmath10.16 , which translates to a v - band luminosity of ( 5.97 @xmath10.95)@xmath52  l@xmath13 .",

    "the true range of possible values is even larger , because of potential variations in the initial mass function and the observed variations between clusters . given the lack of kinematic constraints , an appropriate way to express the probable mass of the cluster is @xmath54(m / m@xmath13 ) = 5.0@xmath10.1 .",
    "this is entirely consistent with mass estimates for similarly bright and extended , old clusters in the milky way ( e.g. , ic4499 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the lmc ( e.g. , reticulum , * ? ? ?",
    "the cluster s projected position near the center of pegdig raises the question of its provenance and survival . if the cluster formed in situ at the center of the galaxy , then it is natural to ask how it has survived tidal evaporation for 12  gyr .",
    "alternatively , if ddo216-a1 formed at an arbitrary location in the galaxy , then dynamical friction must be acting efficiently enough to bring it nearly to the center within its lifetime .",
    "survivability of clusters in dwarf galaxies can be calculated probabilistically using analytical models for dynamical friction and cluster evolution ( leaman et al . , in preparation ) . using the dynamical friction formula from @xcite , a range of galaxy mass profiles and cluster orbits",

    ", we ran 2000 trials in which the important unconstrained parameters were drawn at random , and the dynamical friction and tidal destruction timescales were calculated analytically . the parameters and their range of sampled values were the initial distance and orbital eccentricity for ddo216-a1 ( evenly distributed from 02  kpc and from 01 , respectively ) , and the virial mass ( log - normal distributed around 10@xmath58  m@xmath13 ) , concentration index ( normally distributed around @xmath9 = 12.5 ) , and einasto profile slope ( evenly distributed between 01 ) for the pegdig halo .    in this set of trials , 27% of the clusters",
    "are found to have survival times longer than 12  gyr and dynamical friction timescales shorter than this . within the range of parameters considered , there were no strong trends of survivability in the concentration index , einasto profile slope , or virial mass , but the best cluster survivability is found for birthplaces from @xmath2300 - 1000  pc from the galaxy center ; nearly half of 10@xmath7  m@xmath13 clusters born within this range sink to within @xmath10100  pc of the center without tidal destruction over their lifetime .",
    "clusters born interior to this region tend to be tidally disrupted , and clusters born in the galaxy outskirts have dynamical friction timescales longer than a hubble time .",
    "the general feature of the analysis , that in many cases clusters will be disrupted , but that the most massive will sometimes survive to be observed near the center of the host galaxy , is consistent with advanced numerical simulations of star formation in dwarfs ( governato , private communication ) .",
    "these analytical calculations show that the cluster location is consistent with formation across a large volume of pegdig , excluding the central region where it is now observed .",
    "given the propensity of clusters to dissolve when located at the center of the galaxy , it seems unlikely that ddo216-a1 formed at its current location .",
    "because dynamical friction tends to stall when the cluster reaches the radius at which the host galaxy density profile flattens into a core , it is not surprising that the cluster is not observed at the precise center of pegdig .",
    "both of these factors point to the likelihood that the true distance from the pegdig center to the cluster is larger than the projected separation .",
    "a census of globular clusters in local group dwarf galaxies has been given in @xcite ; the count has updated slightly since then as the result of hst and wide - field surveys of dwarfs at large distances , at low surface brightness , or where foreground confusion is high . however , most of the additions are small clusters at least an order of magnitude less luminous than ddo216-a1",
    ". notable exceptions to this trend are the brightest 4 of the 7 new clusters discovered in ngc  6822 by @xcite and @xcite ; ngc  6822-sc1 is of similar age , half - light radius , and luminosity to ddo216-a1 , although it is significantly more metal - poor @xcite .",

    "these galaxies are all dsphs ; the cluster ddo216-a1 is as luminous as the entire galaxy eri  ii .",
    "the cluster - hosting dirr galaxies ngc  6822 ( m@xmath41 = @xmath015.2 ) and wlm ( m@xmath41 = @xmath014.2 ) are both far more luminous than pegdig .",
    "the lowest - luminosity local group galaxies with recorded globular clusters as bright as ddo216-a1 are the fornax and sagittarius dwarf spheroidals @xcite .",
    "both galaxies are @xmath21  mag brighter than pegdig and each has multiple clusters .",
    "fornax hosts 5 globulars , and sagittarius at least 4 @xcite , possibly as many as 9 @xcite .",
    "normalising each galaxy to an absolute magnitude of m@xmath41 = @xmath015 , the specific frequency of globular clusters is 29 for fornax , 59 for sagittarius , 7 for ngc  6822 , 2 for wlm , and 10 for pegdig .",
    "pegdig thus has a rather ordinary specific cluster frequency compared to other local group galaxies and its role as cluster host is not surprising .",
    "statistics of clusters in dwarf galaxies beyond the local group are necessarily less complete , but summaries of statistical properties of clusters in dwarfs can be found in , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "ddo216-a1 appears to be a typical old and metal - poor cluster of the type common to both giant and dwarf galaxies , although it is unusual to find a cluster as luminous as ddo216-a1 in a galaxy as faint as pegdig .",
    "the contribution of the cluster to the total light of the galaxy is @xmath20.5% ; @xcite has shown that globular clusters in dwarf galaxies can contribute up to 2025% of the metal - poor stars in a given dwarf . while a detailed analysis awaits the full sfh of pegdig , it appears as though the fraction is much smaller in this case . unlike fornax , wlm , and",
    "ngc  6822 , the cluster does not have a dramatically lower metallicity than the galaxy as a whole , only about 0.3  dex less .",
    "the structural parameters of the cluster resemble those of the `` faint fuzzy '' clusters found in lenticular galaxies @xcite , but its color is much bluer and it otherwise appears typical of the globular cluster population of dwarfs .",
    "ddo216-a1 is unusually close to the center of its host galaxy , and is also unusually extended for a cluster with small projected galacticentric distance @xcite .",
    "however , it clearly falls far below the luminosity and surface brightnesss of clusters that are typically identified as galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds that among dsphs with globular clusters , more than half show clusters seen in projection against the center of the galaxy .",
    "while ddo216-a1 fits among these clusters in luminosity , its large radius distinguishes it from the ( usually ) compact central clusters .",
    "however , it is still quite a bit more compact than very extended clusters like scl - de1  gc1 , with a half - light radius of 22  pc @xcite .",
    "pegdig is the lowest - mass gas - rich galaxy in the local group with a major star cluster .",
    "pegdig is a transition type galaxy , with characteristics of both irregular and spheroidal galaxies ; its principal dsph - like quality is the very low rate of current star formation @xcite . in the ( r@xmath59 , m@xmath41 ) plane , ddo216-a1 is more typical of clusters in dsph galaxies than in dirr @xcite .",
    "if pegdig is considered to be a dirr , then ddo216-a1 would be one of the largest clusters known in a small dirr .",
    "more extreme examples are very rare .",

    "there are numerous cases of globulars in dsphs at the same host galaxy absolute magnitude .",
    "the overall trend with galaxy morphology appears to suggest that globular cluster populations are typically much poorer among the gas - rich dwarfs , which also lack nuclear clusters .",
    "ddo216-a1 is more extended than @xmath290% of galactic and magellanic cloud globular clusters , although given its absolute magnitude and half - light radius it is not an extreme outlier .",
    "it would not be out of place among `` outer halo '' globulars such as ic  4499 or ngc  5053 , magellanic cloud clusters like reticulum ( lmc ) , or clusters like ngc  6822-sc1 .",
    "contrastingly , it is much more luminous than the extended clusters fornax 1 , arp 2 , ter 8 , or pal 12 , similarly extended clusters that are either definite or probable members of spheroidal galaxies .    given the complexity of the field star background , it is impossible to say whether there are multiple ages or metallicities present in the cluster without spectroscopy .",
    "these features would be indicative of cluster mergers or in situ star formation from newly accreted gas in the cluster , either of which could contribute to the formation of a nuclear star cluster .",
    "however , circumstantial evidence argues against it being a nuclear cluster : it would be an extreme outlier from the host mass - cluster radius and -cluster mass relations presented in @xcite , being both too extended for its mass and too massive for its host compared to other nuclear star clusters .",
    "we have imaged the central , extended star cluster in the pegasus transition dwarf with hst / acs , and obtained a color - magnitude diagram reaching @xmath20.5  mag above the cluster main - sequence turnoff .",
    "ddo216-a1 is in some respects a typical globular cluster but is more extended than most .",
    "we find in particular the following major features :    1 .",
    "we have confirmed that ddo216-a1 is a bona fide globular cluster , with absolute i - magnitude m@xmath5 = @xmath60 , a mass of @xmath1110@xmath7  m@xmath13 , and a half - light radius @xmath61  pc . while it is larger than @xmath290% of milky way globular clusters , it is not structurally dissimilar to some of the outer halo milky way globular clusters , and is not an extreme example of the type of extended cluster that seems to be characteristic of some dwarf galaxies . 2 .   based on the color - magnitude diagram ,",
    "the cluster is ancient , 12.3 @xmath10.8  gyr old , and is moderately metal - poor , [ fe / h ] = @xmath01.6 @xmath10.2 . in its variable star properties , ddo216-a1 harbors @xmath230 rr  lyrae stars , and",
    "is an oosterhoff type i cluster with a specific frequency s @xmath242 .",
    "3 .   ddo216-a1 contributes @xmath20.5% of the v - band luminosity of pegdig , but the galaxy does not have an anamolously high specific frequency of clusters compared to other dwarf galaxies . despite the low mass of the host ,",
    "the cluster is very close to the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function for all local group galaxies .",
    "the cluster is seen in projection within 30  pc of the galaxy center , but it is much fainter than dwarf galaxy nuclei .",
    "birth at a distance of @xmath110.31  kpc and subsequent infall due to dynamical friction is a possible scenario resulting in the observed cluster position . because dynamical friction is inefficient within cored mass distributions , and the cluster has not been tidally disrupted , it is likely that the true distance between the cluster and galaxy center is a few times larger than the projected separation .",
    "the association of globular clusters with intense episodes of star formation involving very large gas masses @xcite indicates that pegdig might have had a tumultuous early history . the observed relationship between the size of the largest star cluster and the peak sfr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that pegdig should have experienced its highest sfr around the time that ddo216-a1 formed .",
    "considering the large star formation surface densities associated with the formation of a cluster as massive as ddo216-a1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the constraints on the total stellar mass of the galaxy , this raises the likelihood that pegdig may have formed a large fraction of its stars in an intense burst around the time of cluster formation .",
    "the resulting peak in sfr at early times would tend to make pegdig more similar to a prototypical dsph than to a dirr .",
    "although pegdig is not currently close to any other known system , its radial velocity and distance from m31 suggest that it is not likely to be on its first infall into the local group .",
    "@xcite have found in their cosmological simulations of structure formation that in mock local groups , the majority of dwarf galaxy - sized subhaloes found within 11.5 virial radii of a large halo at redshift @xmath15 = 0 have previously spent time inside the virial radius . timing arguments using numerical action reconstructions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while subject to significant uncertainty due to unknown initial conditions , also suggest that pegdig has not always been isolated .",
    "close encounters with m31 or another dwarf could have dramatically increased the sfr and therefore the statistical probability for a large cluster to be formed .",
    "@xcite predict from cosmological simulations that most dwarf - dwarf major mergers tend to occur near the time of first infall into the virial radius of a larger parent galaxy , consistent with the large age of ddo216-a1 .",
    "the next paper in this series will examine the complete star formation history of pegdig ; the sample cmd for an outer field indicates that photometry well below the oldest msto will allow a detailed reconstruction of the sfh back to the oldest ages .",
