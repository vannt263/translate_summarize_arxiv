    "an issue that is of fundamental significance in the field of topological order is how to drive a system into topologically nontrivial states , such that their intriguing properties can be exploited .",
    "the topologically nontrivial state usually requires inverting two bulk bands of different symmetries , which is typically achieved by tuning an energy parameter such as chemical potential@xcite , hopping amplitude@xcite , external magnetic field@xcite , interface coupling@xcite , etc .",
    "consequently , to identify the topological phase transitions , the usual way is to seek the value of the tuning energy parameter at which the gap of the two bulk bands closes . provided the system belongs to a suitable symmetry class@xcite , one then expects that the band inversion leads to a topologically nontrivial phase .",
    "recently , another recipe for judging topological phase transitions has been developed , namely the scaling theory of topological invariants@xcite .",
    "drawing an analogy from kadanoff s scaling approach@xcite , which lays the foundation for the renormalization group ( rg ) in landau s order parameter paradigm , the issue of scaling is itself of importance .",
    "since topologically nontrivial systems do not necessarily possess order parameters , the very concept of scaling must follow a different principle than in kadanoff s approach .",
    "indeed , it was shown in ref .",
    ", that for inversion - symmetric topologically nontrivial systems the meaning of scaling corresponds to stretching a knotted string , thereby revealing the number of knots it contains@xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to kadanoff s approach , where short range degrees of freedom are successively integrated out .",
    "the philosophy behind the scaling theory of topological invariants is the observation that topological properties are characterized by a winding number that is calculated from a momentum - space integration of a certain curvature function , e.g. , a berry curvature@xcite , a berry connection@xcite , or a winding number density@xcite .",
    "although the curvature function ( local curvature of a closed string ) changes as the tuning energy parameter varies , the winding number ( number of knots ) remains the same , as long as the system stays in the same topological phase .",
    "the scaling procedure is a process that converges the curvature function into its fixed point configuration without changing the winding number .",
    "hence , the  rg flow \" of the tuning energy parameter is akin to stretching a string until all the knots are tightened .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive the scaling theory for inversion - symmetric topological systems characterized by @xmath0 topological invariants@xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath1 invariants , which are computed from a berry curvature ( or a winding number density ) , the @xmath0 invariants can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements of the time - reversal operator @xmath2@xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath5-th occupied eigenstate at momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the tuning energy parameter is denoted by @xmath7 ( previously denoted by @xmath8 in ref . ) .",
    "note that @xmath9 invariants can also be defined in terms of the sewing matrix@xcite @xmath10 .",
    "( for alternative definitions of the @xmath0 invariants see also ref .  . ) here , however we focus on @xmath0 invariants given in terms of eq .",
    "( [ time_reversal_operator_matrix ] ) , because @xmath11 is antisymmetric at any @xmath6 and hence its pfaffian is a continuous function that can be rescaled to judge topological phase transitions .",
    "the pfaffian of @xmath12 , on the other hand , is only defined at the discrete time - reversal invariant momenta , for which we do not see how a continuous scaling scheme can be constructed .",
    "there are two possible ways to obtain the @xmath0 invariant from eq .",
    "( [ time_reversal_operator_matrix ] ) : ( i ) from the phase of @xmath13 or ( ii ) from the sign of @xmath14 . in the following",
    "we demonstrate that for each of these two possibilities there exists a continuous scaling scheme , which employs either the phase gradient or second derivative of @xmath14 . under these scaling schemes ,",
    "the rg flow of any tuning energy parameter can be obtained , from which the topological phase transitions can be identified , regardless of the symmetry class of the system .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a length scale defined from the divergence of the phase gradient of @xmath14 [ or from the second derivative of @xmath14 ] at time - reversal invariant momenta .",
    "this length scale signals scale invariance at the fixed points and critical points , thereby implying universal critical behavior .",
    "let us start by considering the scaling scheme which employs the phase of @xmath14 .",
    "before we examine several examples , we first discuss the general formalism of this scaling scheme .",

    "due to time - reversal symmetry , the vortices in @xmath22 appear as pairs , one in each half bz .",
    "states with an odd number of vortices in @xmath23 are topologically distinct from those with an even number of vortices in @xmath23 .",
    "the scaling scheme is constructed in the following way .",
    "we choose a scaling direction @xmath24 to define the scaling function @xmath25 which is an even function around a time - reversal invariant momentum @xmath26 @xmath27 given an initial value of @xmath7 , we seek for a new @xmath28 that satisfies @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a small displacement along the scaling direction .",
    "the mapping @xmath31 gives an rg flow that identifies the topological phase transition .",
    "the reason for considering eq .",
    "( [ scaling_procedure_general ] ) is the deviation - reduction mechanism detailed in ref .  .",
    "in short , we write @xmath32 as a sum of the fixed point configuration @xmath33 and the deviation @xmath34 away from it @xmath35 because the deviation part @xmath36 in inversion symmetric systems is an even function of @xmath6 and must integrate to zero to conserve the @xmath0 invariant , it can be expanded in terms of fourier cosine series .",
    "one can then rigorously proved that the amplitude of the deviation part at the high symmetry point @xmath37 gradually reduces to zero under the operation of eq .",
    "( [ scaling_procedure_general ] ) .",

    "we remark that similar to all other rg approaches , this scaling scheme finds the fixed point @xmath41 but it does not give a physical meaning to @xmath41 , i.e. , it does not tell us whether a particular @xmath41 is topologically trivial or nontrivial , which nevertheless can be clarified by directly calculating the @xmath0 invariant at @xmath41 or at any @xmath7 that flows to this @xmath41 .    expanding eq .",
