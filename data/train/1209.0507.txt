    "<S> we investigated the chiral symmetry and @xmath0 anomaly at finite temperature by applying the functional renormalization group to the @xmath1 linear sigma model . expanding the local potential around the classical fields , we derived the flow equations for the renormalization parameters . in chiral limit , </S>",
    "<S> the flow equation for the chiral condensate is decoupled from the others and can be analytically solved . </S>",
    "<S> the goldstone theorem is guaranteed in vacuum and at finite temperature , and the two phase transitions for the chiral and @xmath0 symmetry restoration happen at the same critical temperature . in general case with explicit chiral symmetry breaking , </S>",
    "<S> the two symmetries are partially and slowly restored , and the scalar and pseudoscalar meson masses are controlled by the restoration in the limit of high temperature . </S>"
