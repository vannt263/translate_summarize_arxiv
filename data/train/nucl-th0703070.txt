    "study of unstable nuclei with radioactive ion beam ( rib ) facilities has opened an exciting channel to look for some crucial issues in context of both nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics @xcite .",
    "unstable nuclei play an influential , and in some cases dominant , role in many phenomena in the cosmos such as novae , supernovae , x - ray bursts , and other stellar explosions . at extremely high temperatures ( @xmath0 k ) of these astrophysical environments",
    ", the interaction times between nuclei can be so short ( @xmath1 seconds ) that unstable nuclei formed in a nuclear reaction can undergo subsequent reactions before they decay .",
    "sequences of ( predominantly unmeasured ) nuclear reactions occurring in exploding stars are therefore quite different than sequences occurring at lower temperatures , for example , characteristic of those occurring in sun .",
    "the direct study of stellar properties in ground - based laboratories has become more attractive , due to the availability of ribs , for example the study of @xmath2ne induced neutron pick - up reaction could reveal information about the exotic @xmath3o+@xmath4ne reaction happening in the cno cycle in burning stars .",
    "study of the structure and reactions of unstable nuclei is therefore required to improve our understanding of the astrophysical origin of atomic nuclei and the evolution of stars and their ( sometimes explosive ) deaths",
    ".    experimental study of unstable nuclei has considerably advanced through the technique of using secondary radioactive beams .",
    "the quantities measured in the study include various inclusive cross - sections , for example , reaction or interaction cross - sections , nucleon - removal cross - sections , coulomb breakup cross - sections and momentum distributions of a fragment .",
    "these quantities have played an important role to reveal the nuclear structure of unstable nuclei , particularly halo structure near the drip line @xcite .",
    "the total reaction cross - section ( @xmath5 ) is one of the most fundamental quantities characterizing the nuclear reactions and to probe for nuclear structure details .",
    "recent studies using rib have demonstrated a large enhancement of @xmath6 induced by neutron rich nuclei , which has been interpreted as neutron halo @xcite ( such as @xmath7li , @xmath8be , etc . ) and neutron skin structure @xcite ( such as @xmath9he and @xmath10he ) .",
    "the halo structure of @xmath7li seems to be consistent with all the experimental results including the enhancement of interaction cross - section @xmath11 , the enhancement of two - neutron removal cross - section ( @xmath12 ) and the narrow peak in the momentum distribution of fragmentation of @xmath13li .    at present",
    "the glauber model is a standard tool to calculate the cross - sections because it can account for a significant part of breakup effects which play an important role in the reaction of a weakly bound nucleus @xcite .",
    "the glauber model , based on the independent individual nucleon - nucleon collisions in the overlap zone of the colliding nuclei @xcite , has been used extensively to explain the observed nuclear reaction cross - section for various systems at high energies @xcite .",
    "this model requires the structure information , namely the density profiles , of the nuclei involved .",
    "this information has to be provided by nuclear structure models , like the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory which is effectively used for this purpose recently @xcite .",
    "the rmf formalism is well suited for the studies of exotic nuclei @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the spin orbit interaction automatically , unlike to the non - relativistic case .",
    "the parameters are fitted by taking into account the properties of few spherical nuclei .",
    "the inclusion of rho - meson takes into account the proton - neutron asymmetry and gives an impression that the theory can be used to nuclei far away from the valley of @xmath14-stability . apart from these",
    ", the advantage of the rmf model is the microscopic calculations of nuclear structure starting from the lagrangian with same parameters applicable for the whole nuclear chart and beyond .",
    "the recent extension of this formalism with field theory motivated effective lagrangian approach ( e - rmf ) @xcite could extend the applicability of this model to neutron stars and infinite nuclear matter @xcite . hence this model provides us better predictability to explore the features of exotic nuclei .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to study the nuclear reaction cross - section using rmf and e - rmf nuclear densities in conjunction with the glauber model .",
    "the paper is presented as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss in brief the formalism used in the present work . in section iii , we discuss our results for the ground state properties of few selected light mass nuclei and cross - sections of reactions involving them .",

    "the standard glauber form for the reaction cross - section at high energies , is expressed @xcite as : @xmath33db \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , the transparency function , is the probability that at an impact parameter @xmath35 the projectile pass through the target without interacting .",

    "@xmath41 is the experimental nucleon - nucleon reaction cross - section which varies with respect to energy .",
    "the @xmath42-integrated densities @xmath43 are defined as @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath14 usually depend on either the proton - proton ( neutron - neutron ) or proton - neutron case , but we have used some appropriate average values in the present calculations @xcite .",
    "the argument of @xmath34 in eq .",

    "the glauber model agrees very well with the experimental data at high energies .",
    "however , this model fails to describe , reasonably , the collisions induced at relatively low energies . in such case the present version of glauber model is modified in order to take care of finite range effects in profile function and coulomb modified trajectories .",

    "as more extensive observational data is gathered from earth and space observatories , an ever - greater demand is placed on our knowledge of the basic physical processes that probe astrophysical phenomena .",
    "considerable efforts at institute of modern physics , cas ( china ) and at riken ( japan ) are underway to look for rib+rib cross - section using rib as internal target with rib projectile .",
    "although such measurements are not feasible with presently available experimental techniques , yet the fast advancement in rib techniques may provide us this facility in next few years or so .",
    "such experiments will be decisive in getting precise information about the structure of halo nuclei .",

    "we see from fig .",
    "5 that rmf and e - rmf predict almost similar trend for the variation of cross - section with respect to energy .",

    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite . ]",
    "results for elastic differential cross - section @xmath81 for the @xmath75c+@xmath75c system have been shown in fig .  6 at 30 mev / nucleon as well as 85 mev / nucleon of incident energies .",
    "we see that the elastic scattering angular distributions for @xmath75c+@xmath75c , are better reproduced using e - rmf ( g2 set ) nuclear densities than rmf ( sig - om ) one while demanding conformity with experimental data @xcite .",
    "this example clearly shows the importance of nuclear densities and highlights the sensitivity of the experimental differential cross - section to details of nuclear structure .",
    "results for the elastic scattering angular distributions for rib projectiles have been shown in fig .  7 .    from the above study",
    ", it is interesting to observe that the two relativistic approaches give slightly different cross - sections which could be attributed to the different results obtained for ground state properties .",
    "hence the details of structure information have to be considered crucial as they are well reflected in the reaction cross - sections . at low energy region ( 30 mev / nucleon ) , both differential scattering cross - section ( sig - om and g2 ) are similar to each other as shown in fig .",
    "the experimental trend is reproduced well using both the densities as input in the evaluation of differential cross - section . however , if one analyse the data at 85 mev / nucleon as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , the values of @xmath82 obtained with both rmf and e - rmf approaches agree well with the experiment , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "similar results of differential cross - section for exotic nuclei which are predicted as likely halo candidates , namely @xmath7li , @xmath7be and @xmath79be @xcite , with @xmath75c as target nucleus is shown in fig .  7 taking incident energies as 30 mev / nucleon and 85 mev / nucleon . in all these systems",
    "i.e. @xmath7li+@xmath75c , @xmath7be+@xmath75c , @xmath79be+@xmath75c , the differential cross - sections obtained with both , the rmf and the e - rmf densities are almost similar .",
    "in summary , we have used the glauber model to calculate nuclear reaction cross - section with densities obtained from rmf and e - rmf calculations using sig - om and g2 set of parameters respectively .",
    "we have seen that the calculation of total reaction cross - section can be performed well with the glauber model using rmf and e - rmf nuclear densities as the main ingredient .",
    "the good quality of results shows that the nuclear reaction cross - section predictions from the glauber model calculations using rmf and e - rmf nuclear densities will be helpful in more stringent analysis of the high energy reactions involving the nuclei on either side of the valley of @xmath83-stability .",
    "the comparison with the results of double folding potential analysis using the same rmf and e - rmf nuclear densities would be enriching our knowledge more in the low energy region in this regard .",
    "while analysing the differential cross - section , we found that the e - rmf density suited well to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "the rmf basically fails for larger scattering angle with higher incident energy .",
    "this study clearly shows the importance of extending rmf to e - rmf formalism to reduce the central density of the target .",
    "thus , from these calculations it is clear that the e - rmf theory not only describe the ground state and nuclear matter properties of the nuclei successfully , but also explains the nuclear reaction data quite well .",
    "overall , these calculations give an excellent account for the existing experimental data for ground state properties namely , nuclear radii and binding energy as well as for nuclear reaction cross - section results .",
    "further , it is hoped that such precise studies for cross - section calculations of exotic nuclei may also be very crucial in view of upcoming radioactive ion beam facilities .",

    "<S> we study nuclear reaction cross - sections for stable and unstable projectiles and targets within glauber model , using densities obtained from various relativistic mean field formalisms . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated cross - sections are compared with the experimental data in some specific cases . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the differential scattering cross - sections at several incident energies , and observe that the results found from various densities are similar at smaller scattering angles , whereas a systematic deviation is noticed at large angles . in general , these results agree fairly well with the experimental data . </S>"
