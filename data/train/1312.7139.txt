    "the poisson distribution of order @xmath10 with parameter @xmath11 has probability mass function ( pmf ) @xmath12 where the summation is taken over all @xmath0-tuples of non - negative integers @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 such that @xmath16 [ 19 ] .",
    "it was obtained in @xcite as a limit of the negative binomial distribution of order @xmath0 , and was named so because it reduces to the poisson distribution with pmf @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "denote by @xmath19 the mode(s ) of @xmath20 , i.e. the value(s ) of @xmath21 for which @xmath20 attains its maximum .",
    "it is well known that @xmath22 has a unique mode @xmath23 if @xmath24 , and two modes @xmath25 and @xmath26 if @xmath27 .",
    "it was established recently @xcite that @xmath28 and @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the mean of the poisson distribution of order @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath31 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath32 denotes the greatest integer not exceeding @xmath33 .",
    "we presently show , as a consequence of ( 1.2 ) , that @xmath34 if @xmath5 and @xmath35 ( see proposition [ p:21 ] ) .",
    "we also show that @xmath36 if @xmath7 and @xmath8 if @xmath9 ( see proposition [ p:22 ] ) .",
    "in this section we state and prove the following :        we have @xmath42 for @xmath18 , the condition @xmath43 is obviously necessary and sufficient for proposition [ p:21 ] to hold true . for @xmath44 , however , it is not necessary because of proposition [ p:22 ] .",
    "the definition of @xmath45 and ( 1.2 ) imply @xmath46 next , using ( [ pok ] ) or recurrence ( 2.3 ) of @xcite , for @xmath47 we get @xmath48 it follows that @xmath49 therefore , in order to obtain @xmath45 for @xmath50 , it suffices to compare @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath50 . by means of ( [ s21 ] ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 which complete the proof of the proposition .",
