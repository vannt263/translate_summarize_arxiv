    "recently , two separate groups have interpreted their observations of type ia supernovae as evidence for acceleration in the cosmic expansion , presumably caused by a nonzero cosmological constant ( riess et al .",
    "1998 , henceforth ` r98 ' , and perlmutter et al . 1998 ) . using the supernovae as standard candles ( after correction for the relation between luminosity and light - curve shape ) ,",
    "both groups find a progressive dimming of supernovae at high redshift relative to the predictions of a flat , matter - dominated model , or even an open model with zero cosmological constant .",
    "there are at least two explanations for this dimming which are unrelated to the cosmological parameters : evolutionary effects and dust .",
    "the two observational groups have expended considerable effort attempting to account for such systematics , but this letter argues that the obscuration of distant supernovae by a cosmological distribution of dust is _ not _ ruled out , by developing a simple intergalactic dust model which is reasonable in its creation and dispersement , has reasonable physical properties , and could cause the observed effect without violating constraints such as those noted in r98 .",
    "the standard way to estimate dust extinction , used by the supernova groups , is to apply a relation between reddening and extinction derived from galactic data ( see , e.g. , cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "this relation is a result of the frequency dependence of the opacity curve of the absorbing dust , which can be measured well for galactic dust at wavelengths @xmath1 m , and fit by theoretical models of graphite and silicate dust in the form of small spheres with a distribution of radii ( draine & lee 1984 ; draine & shapiro 1984 ) . because the opacity of this ` standard ' dust falls off rather quickly with increasing wavelength for @xmath2",
    "m , attenuated light is significantly reddened .",
    "the weakness of this method when applied to a new situation is the necessary assumption that the same extinction - reddening relation holds , even though the dust may be of a different species ; standard techniques would not correct for dust which causes extinction without significant reddening . for the same reason , an effectively uniform intergalactic distribution of non - reddening dust could remain undetected by reddening studies such as those of wright & malkan ( 1988 ) and cheng , gaskell & koratkar ( 1991 ) .",
    "to make this idea concrete , let us begin with the theory of dust formation .",
    "very small dust grains are believed to form in a vapor - solid transition , via a process of crystal formation ; these grains may then coagulate into larger ones . in small grain formation , nuclei form first , and",
    "then they grow as surface nucleation occurs on their faces .",
    "surface nucleation creates steps which grow along the face , adding a new layer and increasing the crystal size . but environments of low supersaturation ( as may commonly occur astrophysically ) strongly inhibit surface nucleation . in such cases , grains may still grow by the mechanism of a ` screw dislocation ' ( see e.g. frank 1949 , sears 1955 ) , or by growth of a rolled - up platelet ( bacon 1960 ) , forming one - dimensional ` needles ' like those commonly found in laboratory experiments ( e.g. nabarro & jackson 1958 . )",
    "moreover , needles can grow rapidly where ` spherical ' dust can not ; thus in some situations needles can out - compete spherical dust for available metals .",
    "this reasoning led donn & sears ( 1963 ) to predict that interstellar dust could be dominated by needle - type dust .",
    "these predictions were partially borne out by the discovery of estatite needles in captured interstellar dust ( bradley , brownlee & veblen 1983 . )",
    "the needles were not the dominant component , but their discovery does demonstrate that vapor - solid transitions occur astrophysically , and that astrophysical needles can form by the same mechanism as in laboratories ( they contained screw dislocations . )",
    "conducting needles are physically interesting because they act as antennas , absorbing electromagnetic radiation more effectively than standard dust .",
    "several authors have proposed models in which such grains thermalize the microwave background ( see , e.g. , wickramasinghe et al .",
    "1975 ; wright 1982 ; hawkins & wright 1988 ) .",
    "i have calculated the extinction cross section for needles at @xmath3 m using the ` discrete dipole approximation ' ( see , e.g. , draine 1988 ) as implemented in the publicly available ddscat package and using the accompanying graphite dielectric constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see laor & draine 1993 ) .",
    "following wickramasinghe & wallis ( 1996 ) , i assume that the graphite @xmath6-axis is perpendicular to the needle so that @xmath4 applies for an electric field parallel to the needle axis ( see also bacon 1960 ) .",
    "figure [ fig - needopac ] shows curves for various needle diameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 \\le 0.2 $ ] , averaged over incident radiation directions , and averaged over an aspect ratio distribution @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "this mass - equipartition distribution was chosen to represent a shattering spectrum from longer needles ; laboratory needles grow up to @xmath11 the maximal @xmath12 is somewhat arbitrary but largely irrelevant since the short - wavelength behavior depends only weakly on @xmath13 the results roughly agree with the mie calculations of wickramasinghe and wallis ( 1996 ) which use somewhat different optical data .",
    "major uncertainties in the opacity model include the uncertainties in optical data ( see draine & lee 1984 for discussion ) , an unknown impurity content in the needles , and the unknown needle diameter ; note that a distribution of diameters would likely simply be dominated by the low - diameter cutoff . ] the model given is intended to be suggestive rather than complete .",
    "the key point is that needles generically have an opacity which is higher ( @xmath14 ) and less wavelength - dependent than that of standard dust .",
    "several works ( chiao & wickramasinghe 1972 , ferrara et al . 1990 and 1991 , barsella et al .",
    "1989 ) have studied dust ejection from galaxies , all concluding that most spiral galaxies could eject ( spherical ) graphite dust .",
    "these theoretical studies are supported by observations of dust well above the gas scale height in galaxies ( ferrara et al .",
    "1991 ) and of vertical dust lanes and fingers protruding from many spiral galaxies ( sofue , wakamatsu & malin 1994 ) .",
    "the high opacity of needles extends over a large wavelength range , hence they are strongly affected by radiation pressure and are even more likely be ejected than spherical grains . in a magnetized region , charged grains spiral about magnetic field lines .",
    "magnetized gas may escape from the galaxy via the parker ( 1970 ) instability , or grains may escape by diffusing across the lines during the fraction of the time that they are uncharged ; see , e.g. , barsella et al .",
    "once free of the galaxy for the 0.01 @xmath15 m silicate spheres and even less for faster moving or larger grains ( ferrara et .",
    "al . 1991 ) , so the effect on the needles would be very small .",
    "] , needles would rapidly accelerate and could reach distances of 1 mpc or more .",
    "following hoyle & wickramasinghe ( 1988 ) , we estimate the time required for needle ejection and dispersement as follows . a grain with length @xmath16 ,",
    "cross section @xmath17 , specific gravity @xmath18 and opacity @xmath19 in a anisotropic radiation field will attain a terminal velocity @xmath20 given by equating the radiative acceleration @xmath21 to the deceleration due to viscous drag of @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the net radiative flux , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the gas thermal speed and density .",
    "values applicable for needles in our galaxy are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29k , and @xmath30 .",
    "these give a terminal velocity of @xmath31 and a timescale to escape a 100 pc gas layer of @xmath32 outside the gas layer , the needle is subject only to radiation pressure . for a rough estimate",
    "we assume that the constant acceleration @xmath33 acts for the time required for the needle to travel a distance equal to the galactic diameter .",
    "this takes @xmath34 for a galaxy of size @xmath35 and leaves the needle with velocity @xmath36 .",
    "such a velocity will carry the needle 1 mpc ( twice the mean galaxy separation at @xmath37 ) in @xmath38 gyr . for comparison ,",
    "the time between @xmath39 ( when dust might be forming ) and @xmath40 ( when the supernovae are observed ) is 5.5 gyr for @xmath41 and 7.3 gyr for @xmath42 these estimates suggest that radiation pressure should be able to distribute the dust fairly uniformly ) passes through many clumps of size @xmath43 and separation @xmath44 , i.e. that @xmath45 ( the observed dispersion in r98 is 0.21 mag , similar to the necessary extinction ) .",
    "this is easily satisfied for needles traveling @xmath46 kpc from their host galaxies . ] before @xmath47 .",
    "dust is known to exist in large quantities ( masses @xmath48 of the total galaxy mass are often inferred ) in bright , high - redshift galaxies ( see , e.g. , hughes 1996 ) .",
    "these galaxies would preferentially eject dust with higher opacity at long wavelengths ( e.g. needles , or fractal / fluffy grains ) ; such grains tend to have a shallower falloff in opacity with wavelength , hence redden less than the observed galactic dust .",
    "this selection affect and the estimation of dust escape timescales suggest that if substantial intergalactic dust exists , it should be effectively uniform , and redden less than standard dust .",
    "we can compute the optical depth to a given redshift due to uniform dust of constant comoving density using @xmath49 \\over ( 1+\\omega z')^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] figure [ fig - needopac ] shows the integrated optical depth to various redshifts for needles with @xmath50 , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 using this information , we can calculate the dust mass necessary to account for the observations if @xmath54 the difference between an @xmath55 model and a model with @xmath56 ( the favored fit of r98 ) is about 0.2 magnitudes at @xmath57 in the @xmath58 m needle model this requires @xmath59 matching an @xmath60 universe requires about 0.5 magnitudes of extinction at @xmath61 and @xmath62    a reddening correction based on standard dust properties , like that used in r98 , would not eliminate this effect .",
    "r98 effectively estimates extinction using rest - wavelength ( after k - correction ) @xmath63 color and the galactic reddening law . for standard dust",
    "this would be reasonable even for a cosmological dust distribution , since the reddening would still occur the across the redshift - corrected @xmath64 and @xmath65 frames .",
    "but figure [ fig - needopac ] shows that this does not hold for needles : the @xmath58 m needle distribution only gives @xmath66 up to @xmath61 .",
    "the supernova group method would @xmath67correct the @xmath64 and @xmath65 magnitudes , then convert this ( rest frame ) @xmath63 into an extinction based on the galactic @xmath68 it would therefore not be surprising for the systematic extinction to go undetected .",
    "studies of redshift - dependent reddening ( e.g. wright 1981 , wright & malkan 1987 , cheng et al .",
    "1991 ) in far - uv ( rest frame ) quasar spectra put limits on a uniform dust component , but these are most sensitive to high redshifts , at which the needles would not yet have formed and uniformly dispersed . in addition , it is clear from figure [ fig - needopac ] that for thick needles the flatness of the opacity curve would lead to a very small shift in the quasar spectral index up to @xmath69    another available constraint , the metallicity of ly-@xmath70 clouds , is probably not relevant ; because the dust formation and ejection ( due to radiation pressure ) from galaxies is independent of the enrichment mechanism of the clouds ( presumably population iii enrichment or gas ` blowout ' from galaxies ) , there is no clear connection between the mass of metal gas in the clouds and the mass of needle dust in the igm metallicity . ] .    to estimate the fraction of carbon locked in the needle dust",
    ", we would like to know @xmath71 at @xmath72 the current value of @xmath71 should be bounded above by the metal fraction of large clusters , which are the best available approximation to a closed system that is a fair sample of the universe .",
    "clusters tend to have @xmath73 solar metallicity ( e.g. mushotsky et al . 1996 ) , and @xmath74 of their mass in gas ( e.g. bludman 1997 for a summary ) , giving @xmath75 this compares reasonably well with an upper bound on universal star density estimated from limits on extragalactic starlight ( from peebles 1993 ) of @xmath76 : if we extrapolate the galactic metallicity of @xmath77 , we find @xmath78 assuming a current @xmath79 and that metals are created constantly ( conservative , given the higher star formation rate at high-@xmath0 ) in time from @xmath80 we find ( for both @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) that @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which agrees with recent estimates by renzini ( 1998 ) .",
    "even such crude approximations are very vulnerable , but suggest that the needed amount of needle mass is reasonable .",
    "the needle model is falsifiable in several ways .",
    "first , the needle opacity spectrum is not perfectly flat , especially for small @xmath85 observations over a long wavelength span might reveal a redshift - dependent systematic change in certain colors .",
    "next , the needles take some minimum time to form , then more time to achieve a uniform cosmic distribution .",
    "thus at high enough redshift the dispersion in supernova brightnesses discussed in r98 appears .",
    "moreover , at @xmath86 the difference between the @xmath87 model with dust and the @xmath88 model sans dust is @xmath89 mag , which should eventually be observable .",
    "i shall not attempt to address the question of galaxy counts here . as commented in r98",
    ", grey dust would exacerbate the ` problem ' of unexpectedly high galaxies counts at high-@xmath0 , but the magnitude of such an effect would depend upon the dust density field s redshift evolution , and a full discussion of the galaxy count data as a constraint on the model ( requiring also an understanding of galaxy evolution ) is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "galactic observations probably can not disprove the model , since needles with the properties most different than those of galactic dust would be ejected with high efficiency .",
    "moreover , dust with needle - like characteristics may have been detected by cobe ( wright et .",
    "al . 1991 ; reach et al . 1995 ; dwek et al .",
    "1997 ) as a minor ` very cold ' component of galactic dust .",
    "such a component is best explained by dust with a hitherto - unknown ir emission feature , or by fluffy / fractal or needle dust ( wright 1993 ) and could represent a residual needle component with about 0.02 - 0.4% of the standard dust mass . as effectively ( per unit mass ) in the optical where most galactic radiation resides , and the ` very cold ' component emits between .1% and 2% of the total fir dust luminosity ( reach et al .",
    "1995 ) . ]    on the other hand , the dust can not escape from clusters , which have much higher mass / light ratios , so needles formed _",
    "after _ the formation of a cluster should remain trapped within . studies of background quasar counts ( bogart & wagner 1973 ; boyle et al . 1988 ;",

    "an earlier calculation gave @xmath99 for the intergalactic needles .",
    "assuming the calculated dust destruction , this predicts @xmath100 the needles are about five times as opaque in optical as standard dust , so this gives an optical opacity ratio of @xmath101 .",
    "if these estimates are accurate , comparison of nearby cluster supernovae to nearby non - cluster supernovae at fixed distance should reveal a mean systematic difference of @xmath102 in fluxes _ after _",
    "correction for reddening .",
    "stromlo abell cluster supernova search ( reiss et al . 1998 ) , currently underway , should make such an analysis possible .",
    "note that uncertainties in the needle opacity relative to standard dust will not affect the cluster prediction which ( modulo the quantitative uncertainties ) should hold unless clusters destroy needles more efficiently than standard dust .",
    "i have argued that the reduction of supernova fluxes at high redshift could be caused by a uniform distribution of intergalactic dust .",
    "both theoretical arguments and observational evidence strongly suggest that some dust should be ejected from galaxies .",
    "dust with high opacity ( especially at long wavelengths where most of the luminosity of high - redshift starburst galaxies resides ) would be preferentially ejected .",
    "but this is exactly the sort of dust which would both redden less than standard dust , and require less dust mass to produce the observed effect .",
    "this letter develops a specific model of intergalactic dust composed of carbon needles  a theoretically reasonable , even expected , form of carbon dust  with conservative properties .",
    "the supernova data can be explained by a quantity of carbon needles which is plausible in light of rough estimates of the universal metal abundance .",
    "because the dust distribution is effectively uniform , it does not induce a dispersion in the supernova magnitudes , and because it absorbs more efficiently than standard dust , it does not require an unreasonable mass .",
    "finally , because the dust is created and ejected by high-@xmath0 galaxies , it does not overly obscure _ very _ high redshift galaxies or quasars",
    ". thus the key arguments given in r98 against ` grey ' dust do not apply .",
    "the dust of the proposed model should , however , provide independent signatures of its existence ; one is a systematic difference in fluxes between cluster and non - cluster supernovae which may be detectable in ongoing surveys . finally , the needle model is only one specific model for intergalactic dust .",
    "other possible ` dust ' types are fractal dust ( e.g. wright 1987 ) , platelets ( e.g. donn & sears 1963 ; bradley et al . 1983 ) , hollow spheres ( layzer & hively 1973 ) , or hydrogen snowflakes .",
    "the explanation of reduced supernova flux at high redshift described in this letter depends upon the plausible but still speculative assumption that the intergalactic dust distribution has significant mass , and is dominated by grains with properties exemplified by those of carbon needles .",
    "the probability that this is the case should be weighed against the severity of the demand that the explanation favored by riess et al . and perlmutter et al .",
    "places on a solution of the vacuum energy ( or cosmological constant ) problem : the expected value of the vacuum energy density at the end of the gut era must be reduced by some as yet unknown process , not to zero , but to a value exactly one hundred orders of magnitude smaller .",
