    "the standard model ( sm ) describes with an outstanding level of accuracy the interactions between the elementary particles up to the energies tested to date .",
    "however , there exist theoretical issues in considering the sm as a definitive theory valid above the tev scale and it is expected to find signals of physics beyond the sm at higher energies .",
    "one of the most attractive ideas to solve the hierarchy problem as well as the fermionic hierarchy , is that the electroweak ( ew ) scale is broken by a new strongly interacting sector . since the sm masses arise from the interactions with this new sector , the heavier sm particles couple stronger with it .",
    "therefore , we expect indirect new physics ( np ) effects to manifest first associated with heavy sm particles , being the third generation of quarks a potential window for discoveries .    in the last years ,",
    "tevatron , lep and slc have explored the ew scale showing some discrepancies in observables related to the top and bottom quarks . in particular ,",
    "a deviation from the sm prediction has been measured in the forward - backward asymmetry of the top quark at tevatron  @xcite , whereas a large deviation in the forward - backward asymmetry of the bottom quark has been found at lep and slc  @xcite .",
    "these experimental results have motivated several theoretical works which have addressed explanations of the anomalous measurements within different np models .",
    "on the one side , the top asymmetry excess has been investigated through phenomenological analyses as well as in specific models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the bottom puzzle has been undertaken in different theoretical scenarios without considering possible correlations with top quark physics  @xcite .",
    "an updated value of the forward - backward asymmetry of the top quark pair production in the laboratory ( @xmath4 ) frame for an integrated luminosity of 5.3 @xmath5  @xcite has been recently reported by the cdf collaboration : @xmath6",
    "even if this result is in more agreement with the sm than the previous measurements performed by cdf and d0  @xcite , it is still larger than the nlo qcd prediction @xmath7   uncertainty is assigned in this case to take into account nnlo qcd corrections  @xcite .",
    "]  @xcite by about a 1.7@xmath8 deviation .",
    "the situation is slightly ameliorated for the forward - backward asymmetry in the center of mass ( @xmath0 ) frame of the top pair .",
    "this asymmetry has been measured by cdf at 5.3 @xmath5  @xcite and d0 at 4.3 @xmath5  @xcite . for the cdf result , @xmath9 , the theoretical prediction at nlo in qcd , @xmath10  @xcite , is smaller by about a 1@xmath8 deviation .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry is zero in both reference frames at lo in qcd .",
    "thus , its origin in the sm has to be traced in the presence of asymmetric differential distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 at higher orders in qcd .",
    "since the strong interaction is invariant under charge conjugation , the forward - backward asymmetry is an equivalent measure of such asymmetric distributions . in particular , @xmath13 is generated at nlo by the interference of the born amplitude ( quark annihilation ) with box corrections and by the interference of initial and final state gluon radiation amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration has published a combination of measurements of the top quark pair production cross section ( @xmath14 ) for the leptonic and hadronic channels with an integrated luminosity of up to 4.6 @xmath5  @xcite _ t |t(m_t = 172.5 ) = 7.50 0.31 ( ) 0.34 ( ) 0.15 ( ) .",

    "[ lepresults ] although @xmath17 is in very good agreement with the sm best fit , the measured value of the forward - backward asymmetry is smaller than the sm prediction by about a @xmath18 deviation  @xcite .",
    "this situation leads to a remarkable challenge : the potential existence of np corrections significantly affecting the asymmetry but negligibly contributing to @xmath17 or , equivalently , shifting the @xmath19 coupling by a relatively large correction of order @xmath20 and the @xmath21 coupling by a small correction of order @xmath22  @xcite .    since @xmath23 and @xmath24 are in the same weak doublet , it is worthwhile to consider a joint analysis of the top and bottom observables previously described .",
    "np addressing the deviations on the bottom @xmath13 , can also induce important effects on the top sector , and vice versa , np affecting the top @xmath13 measured at tevatron , can induce large effects on the bottom sector .",
    "therefore , we will explore whether both effects can be simultaneously accomplished in composite higgs models .    in this work we present a two sector model  @xcite which",
    "can be thought as a low energy effective description of a 5d warped model with an elementary sector describing the sm fields , except the higgs , and a new sector describing the lightest level of resonances of a strongly coupled theory .",
    "we choose the global symmetries of the new sector and the quantum numbers of the resonances that are able to accomplish the corrections in the top and bottom observables previously discussed , while simultaneously minimizing the corrections for the light fermions .",
    "once the model is fixed , we compute the predictions for those observables and make simulations to probe whether tree - level corrections are able to explain the unexpected central values of the observed forward - backward asymmetries .",
    "since the measured values of the total @xmath0 cross section depend on the final state considered in a given particular experimental analysis and we have performed our simulations up to a parton - level @xmath25 state , it is not aimed at accomplishing a precise comparison between our predictions and experimental data on @xmath14 , but the purpose is to present rough results that show the tendency of the np effects we have considered .",
    "moreover , since both cdf and d0 have measured the @xmath25 invariant mass distribution  @xcite , we have also included this observable in our analysis .",
    "we have also pursued to obtain the mass spectrum of the quarks as well as the correct light - quark couplings to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as minimal requirements to be satisfied by any consistent analysis .",

    "the physical mass eigenstates arise after the diagonalization of the elementary / composite mixing as well as the higgs vev mixing .",
    "we will proceed in two steps , in the first step we will diagonalize the elementary / composite mixings , obtaining a set of massless fermions and gauge bosons that can be associated with the sm fields , and a set of massive fields at tev scale .",

    "we have found regions in the parameter space that increase @xmath13 but decrease @xmath94 when compatibility with @xmath259 distribution is required . in particular , the expectation for @xmath13 in the lab frame is increased from @xmath308 to @xmath309 , which should be compared with the experimental result @xmath310 . on the other hand ,",
    "the model predicts a decrease in the @xmath242 cross section with respect to the sm simulation of about 10% - 20% in this region of the parameter space .",
    "we have checked that for this region of the parameter space , the sm spectrum is properly reproduced while solving the bottom @xmath13 anomaly , and that the corrections to @xmath101 are non - universal and order @xmath311 for the first and second generation .",
    "we have also verified that the partial wave amplitudes unitary condition is not violated in this region of parameter space .",
    "we have found that the decrease in the cross section for tevatron energies is a general feature of this kind of composite models .",
    "however , the reduction of the cross section is relatively smaller for lhc , where gluon fusion dominates @xmath25 production , since there is no interaction involving two gluons and one gluon resonance .",
    "the model here presented should be further studied and improved .",
    "in addition to the corrections of the @xmath27 and @xmath26 couplings here studied , a full analysis of the ew precision observables must be performed .",
    "another important issue that must be considered is flavour mixing , since we have only considered diagonal yukawa couplings .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank carlos wagner for many useful discussions and comments .",
    "we also thank daniel de florin , fabio maltoni and ricardo piegaia .",
    "this work is dedicated to the memory of nstor kirchner , who gave us the possibility of coming back home .",
