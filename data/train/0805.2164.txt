    "recent advances in the field of molecular magnetism , using a bottom up approach to synthesis , has produced magnetic systems based on molecules rather than metals or oxides .",
    "example systems include single molecule magnets ( smms ) and high spin molecules @xcite , photo - magnets @xcite and room temperature magnets @xcite .",
    "the focus of the current work is smms and their interaction with the environment .",
    "these systems have been attracting much attention in recent years mainly due to the discovery of quantum tunneling of the magnetization ( qtm ) in mn@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a smm is composed of a small cluster of magnetic ions with strong magnetic interactions between them ( @xmath8  k ) , embedded in magnetically inactive organic or inorganic ligands .",
    "each cluster is thus isolated from its neighbours , forming at low temperatures , a lattice of non - interacting spins and allowing the study of the quantum behaviour of isolated spins .",
    "molecular magnets are ideal objects to study phenomena of great scientific importance for mesoscopic physics , such as qtm @xcite , topological quantum phase interference @xcite , and quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "they could also be applicable for the recording industry @xcite , as well as for information transmission and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the effective spin hamiltonian describing a smm is usually written as @xmath9 where the first term is the easy axis magneto - crystalline anisotropy term , which is the source of the double well structure and degeneracy of spin up and spin down states , the second is the zeeman term , and @xmath10 includes additional crystal field terms as well as the interaction between the molecular spin and its environment ( including molecule - molecule dipolar @xcite and molecule - nuclear spin bath interactions @xcite ) . in prototypical systems such as mn@xmath6 and fe@xmath11 ,",
    "the anisotropy term is large and therefore @xmath10 is only a perturbation , making it difficult to perform direct measurements to identify the detailed nature of @xmath12 .",
    "however , isotropic ( @xmath13 ) systems provide an ideal system in which @xmath10 can be probed directly . in this paper",
    "we present muon spin relaxation ( @xmath14sr ) measurements on the spin 1/2 molecular magnet k@xmath15[v@xmath16as@xmath17o@xmath18(h@xmath19o)]@xmath20h@xmath19o known as v@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "due to its spin 1/2 nature this molecule has no anisotropy , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "we find the molecular spin dynamics of v@xmath0  persists down to mk temperatures , and there is no evidence of freezing even in an applied field of up to 10  kg.@xcite the persistent spin dynamics is consistent with a previously reported @xmath14sr  study@xcite , however , our measurements were extended to lower temperatures and higher fields , allowing a more comprehensive understanding of the nature and source of v@xmath0  spin dynamics .",
    "the spin fluctuation time measured is on the nanosecond scale and saturates at @xmath5 nsec at low temperature .",
    "these molecular spin fluctuations are perpendicular to the applied field direction and are attributed to the interaction between the v@xmath0  molecular spin and its environment , in particular nuclear spins .    molecule .",
    "only v@xmath22 ions are shown here .",
    "the arrows indicate the v@xmath22 spins.,height=188 ]    the v@xmath0  complex consists of a lattice of molecules with fifteen v@xmath22 ions of spin @xmath1 , in a quasi - spherical layered structure formed of a triangle sandwiched between two hexagons ( see fig .  [ v15core ] ) .",
    "when the temperature is lower than @xmath23  k the two hexagons of the v ions form a @xmath24 state due to antiferromagnetic interactions , leaving the three v ions on the triangle with an effective hamiltonian @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the spins of the three v ions and @xmath27  k is the effective coupling between the spins , which is due to competing @xmath28 and @xmath29 interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ v15core ] ) . at temperatures lower than @xmath30",
    "mk the ground state of each v@xmath0  molecule is @xmath31 , with negligible dipolar interactions ( few mk ) between neighbouring molecules .",
    "in contrast to mn@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 , the v@xmath0  molecule has no anisotropy barrier and a large tunneling splitting at zero field , @xmath32  mk @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14sr  experiments were performed on the m15 and m20 beamlines at triumf in vancouver , canada . in these experiments @xmath33 polarized ( along @xmath34 ) positive muons are implanted in the sample .",
    "each implanted muon decays ( lifetime @xmath35 @xmath14sec ) emitting a positron preferentially in the direction of its polarization at the time of decay .",
    "using appropriately positioned detectors , one measures the asymmetry of the muon beta decay along @xmath34 as a function of time @xmath36 , which is proportional to the time evolution of the muon spin polarization .",
    "@xmath36 depends on the distribution of internal magnetic fields and their temporal fluctuations .",
    "further details on the @xmath14sr technique may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "mk and different magnetic fields , and ( b ) @xmath37 g and different temperatures .",
    "the solid lines are fits to eq .",
    "( [ rlx ] ) . ]    the composition and sturcture of v@xmath0  single crystals were confirmed using x - ray diffraction and their magnetization was examined in a squid magnetometer .",
    "these single crystals were then crushed into a fine powder and used for the @xmath14sr  measurements reported here .",
    "the fine powder was placed in a @xmath38he gas flow cryostat to measure the muon spin relaxation in the temperature range between 2.5 to 300 k. for the low temperature measurements the sample was pressed into pellets and placed in a dilution refrigerator ( dr ) to measure the relaxation between 12 mk and 3.5 k. to ensure thermalization of the sample in the dr , the pellets were mounted on a silver plate using apiezon grease , wrapped in a silver foil and attached to the cold finger of the dr .",
    "the relaxation in the full temperature range was measured in magnetic fields up to 10 kg applied in the direction of the initial muon spin polarization .",
    "the measured asymmetry at all temperatures and applied fields was found to fit best to a square root exponential function ( see fig .  [ asy ] ) @xmath39 which reflects the dynamic nature of the local magnetic fields experienced by the muons as well as multiple muon stopping sites @xcite .",
    "here @xmath40 is the initial asymmetry and @xmath41 is the relaxation rate averaged over all stopping sites.@xcite @xmath42 is the non - relaxing background signal due to muons missing the sample and stopping in the silver sample holder .",
    "the high temperature measurements were performed using the low background setup @xcite .",
    "therefore , a non - zero background signal was found only in the measurements done in the dr .",
    "the values of @xmath43 in the full temperature range and various magnetic fields are presented in fig .",
    "[ t1vsth ] .",
    "the relaxation rate increases as the temperature is decreased from room temperature down to @xmath44k due to the slowing down of the thermally activated transitions between the different spin states @xcite .",
    "this increase in the relaxation rate is a signature of the increased correlations between the v moments , as the temperature becomes comparable to the magnetic couplings inside the v@xmath0  core .",
    "similar behavior is observed in many molecular magnets studied by @xmath14sr and nmr @xcite .",
    "most striking is the fact that the relaxation rate at temperatures below @xmath45  k and at fields lower than @xmath46  kg becomes almost temperature independent , in agreement with similar @xmath47h nmr@xcite and @xmath14sr@xcite studies . at higher fields ( @xmath46 and @xmath48  kg ) and temperatures lower than @xmath48  k the relaxation rate decreases as the temperature",
    "is decreased down to @xmath49  mk . since at these temperatures",
    "the @xmath31 ground spin state is preferentially populated , we attribute the decrease in @xmath50 to the reduction in the thermally activated transitions between the ( zeeman ) split @xmath51 states , in agreement with @xmath47h nmr measurements@xcite",
    ". however , at even lower temperatures ( less than @xmath52  mk ) @xmath50 seems to saturate ( within experimental accuracy ) and become temperature independent even at high fields .",
    "note that @xmath50 exhibits a strong field dependence , which can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ asy](a ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath50 seems to be field independent up to @xmath53 kg in ref .  .",
    "the source of discrepancy between these results and our results is still unclear .",
    "a better understanding of the relaxation rate can be obtained by studying the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the total spin operator and spin number , respectively .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath57 are @xmath58 with eigenvalues @xmath59 , where @xmath56 can be either @xmath1 or @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "note that the @xmath31 state is doubly degenerate .",
    "the energy level scheme implies that at temperatures @xmath62  k ( i.e. the splitting between the @xmath63 and @xmath1 states ) , only the ground spin state @xmath31 is appreciably populated . with the absence of additional terms in @xmath64 , the molecular spin and hence the resultant local field experienced by",
    "the muon should be static .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ t1vsth ] at low fields the relaxation rate is finite at these temperatures , and therefore the local field ( and molecular spin ) continues to fluctuate down to @xmath4  mk , the lowest temperature measured .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath64 can not fully describe the system at low temperature .",
    "rather , one expects the existence of an additional term in the spin hamiltonian , @xmath65 , that mixes the unperturbed @xmath66 eigenstates , hence inducing transitions between them .",
    "we expect that the local magnetic field experienced by the implanted muons is proportional to the v@xmath0  neighbouring spins .",
    "hence , assuming that fluctuations of the v@xmath0  spins , described by exponential correlation functions @xcite , are @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the correlation times of the parallel and perpendicular ( to the applied field ) @xmath70 components respectively , and @xmath71 is the electronic resonance frequency .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the correlation times for both components are equal , @xmath72 .",
    "in this case @xmath50 can be written as @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the muon larmor frequency and @xmath75 is an estimate of the coupling strength between the muon and the molecular spin , which depends on the nature of the coupling ( e.g. exchange or dipolar ) . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ slrexact ] ) originates from flipping of the muon while second and third terms are due to flip - flop and co - flipping of the muon and molecular spins , respectively .",
    "using @xmath76 one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ slrexact ] ) as @xcite , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a measure of the distribution of local magnetic field observed by muons , which depends on the coupling strength between the muon spin @xmath79 and molecular spin @xmath70 , and @xmath80 .",
    "note the first term in eq .",
    "( [ slr ] ) is due to fluctuations along the applied field ( @xmath81 ) , while the second is due to fluctuations in @xmath82 and @xmath83 . the value of @xmath84 measures the relative size of parallel versus perpendicular local field .",
    "for example , using the assumptions above , for a dipolar interaction between @xmath79 and @xmath70 ( which is fluctuating randomly in all directions ) we expect on average @xmath85 . however , if our earlier assumption of @xmath86 in eqs .",
    "( [ correlationz ] ) and ( [ correlationxy ] ) does not hold , @xmath84 will contain also information on the importance of parallel versus perpendicular fluctuations , e.g. @xmath87 implies that @xmath88 and therefore @xmath50 is dominated by fluctuations perpendicular to the applied field .",
    "mk ( squares ) and @xmath89  k ( circles ) .",
    "the solid lines are fits to eq .",
    "( [ slr ] ) . ]    next , we evaluate the correlation time @xmath90 from the field dependence of @xmath50 using eq .",
    "( [ slr ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath90 is the fluctuation time of the molecular spin . in fig .",
    "[ t1vsh ] we present the relaxation rate as a function of applied magnetic field for two different temperatures .",
    "the solid lines are fits of the data to eq .  ( [ slr ] ) , from which the values of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath84 for the corresponding temperature are extracted . by fitting the field dependence of @xmath50 for all temperatures",
    "we obtain the values of these parameters as a function of temperature , shown in fig .",
    "[ taufdel ] . in fig .",
    "[ taufdel](a ) the correlation time increases from @xmath92  nsec above @xmath93  k and saturates at @xmath94  nsec below @xmath95  k. the value of this correlation time is similar to that measured earlier in other isotropic high spin molecule systems @xcite .",
    "this similarity strongly suggests that a similar mechanism is responsible for the observed molecular spin fluctuations , namely an interaction between the molecular spin and its environment , in particular the interaction with neighbouring nuclear moments ( nuclear spin bath ) , inducing transitions between the different states @xcite . in ref .",
    "the low temperature dynamics were attributed to spin fluctuations between the two lowest lying @xmath31 doublet , whose energy difference is @xmath96 mk .",
    "however , our measurement show that the dynamics persist down to 12 mk , much lower than the splitting of the doublet . therefore the proposed source of fluctuations in ref .",
    "@xcite can not account for the dynamics observed in v@xmath0 .",
    "( a ) , the size of the local field experienced by muons @xmath91 ( b ) , and the value of @xmath84 ( c ) as a function of temperature . ]    the value of @xmath91 , shown in fig .",
    "[ taufdel](b ) , increases as the temperature is decreased from room temperature down to @xmath97  k. this increase coincides with the observed decrease in the effective magnetic moment above @xmath98  k@xcite .",
    "similarly , the increase below @xmath99  k coincides with the additional decrease in the effective magnetic moment from @xmath100  @xmath101 down to @xmath95  @xmath101 at this temperature .",
    "note that @xmath91 is a measure of the distribution of the local magnetic fields experienced by muons , and therefore is not simply proportional to the measured v@xmath0  magnetic moment .",
    "instead , factors such as the local magnetization combined with the fluctuation rate as well as the type of interaction between the v@xmath0  moments and muons determine the value of @xmath91 .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , if the parallel and perpendicular fluctuations are different , the value of @xmath84 is related to the direction of fluctuations of @xmath70 , perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field ( defined as @xmath34 direction ) .",
    "interestingly , we find @xmath102 at high temperatures ( @xmath103 k ) ( see fig .  [ taufdel](c ) ) , indicating that ( i ) the fluctuations of @xmath70 are in randomly oriented relative to the applied field as expected from thermal fluctuations and ( ii ) the coupling between @xmath79 and @xmath70 is dipolar .",
    "as the temperature is reduced , thermal fluctuations between the spin states become less likely , especially when the temperature is much lower than the energy splitting between the levels ( including zeeman ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fluctuations persist even at mk temperatures .",
    "note however , that at low temperatures @xmath104 , i.e. the fluctuations are predominantly perpendicular to the @xmath34 direction and do not originate from transitions between , e.g. @xmath51 spin states , since these are indeed separated by the zeeman energy .",
    "instead they are most probably due to the finite energy level broadening produced by the interaction between @xmath70 and the nuclear spin bath in the system .",
    "this occurs since in the presence of the nuclear moments ( as a perturbation on @xmath64 ) , @xmath81 is no longer a good quantum number , and therefore the @xmath105 levels are split or broadened .",
    "the size of @xmath94 nsec implies broadening of the levels on the scale of few tens of mk , which is a reasonable size for such interactions @xcite .",
    "finally , since at @xmath106 k there are less correlations between the v ions in the magnetic core , the fluctuations measured by the muon are due to its interaction with multiple , uncorrelated v ions .",
    "this may be the reason for the decrease of @xmath84 at @xmath106 k. alternatively , it may also be due to diffusion of the muons in the sample at these temperatures .    in conclusion , we found that the muon spin lattice relaxation rate is temperature independent at low temperatures and fields , in agreement with earlier nmr and @xmath14sr  measurements.@xcite this temperature independence exhibits the non - thermal / quantum nature of the v@xmath0  molecular spin fluctuations which persist down to @xmath4 mk temperature .",
    "the correlation time of the spin - spin auto - correlation functions was estimated to be @xmath5 nsec at low temperature .",
    "we believe that this low temperature spin dynamics is due to broadening of the spin states introduced by the interactions between the v@xmath0  spin and the nuclear spin bath .",
    "we would like to thank achim mller at the university of bielefeld for providing the sample and bernard barbara at institut nel for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the ciar , nserc and triumf .",
    "we thank syd kreitzman , rahim abasalti , bassam hitti and donald arseneau for technical support .",
    "this relaxation function does not contradict that used in ref .",
    ", however , transverse field muon precession measurements show no evidence for three inequivalent muon sites in the sample",
    ". therefore we use this function to estimate the relaxation rate averaged over all sites ."
