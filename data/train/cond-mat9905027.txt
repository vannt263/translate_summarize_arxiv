    "we consider a dilute gas of @xmath0 particles in @xmath7 dimensions , under shear : the gas is contained between two plates a distance @xmath8 apart ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shear ] ) .",
    "the two plates are moving in opposite directions with a velocity @xmath9 . for not too large @xmath10",
    "one expects that a linear velocity profile will develop , so that the fluid velocity at @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in bulk properties , so we let @xmath13 go to infinity , while the shear rate @xmath10 and the density @xmath14 are fixed . to show the equivalence of the constant @xmath5 thermostat and the gaussian thermostat , it would in principle suffice just to take the horizontal dimensions infinite , but this way we can also move the boundary conditions to infinity . in the real physical system , as @xmath13 get larger , the laminar flow becomes unstable and the system eventually develops turbulence",
    ". however , the thermostats we will consider assume the stability of the laminar flow@xcite , and suppress turbulence .",
    "there is a well known and often used set of equations for molecular simulations that describe shear , the sllod equations@xcite : @xmath15 in which @xmath16 are the phase space coordinates of particle @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the thermostat variable and @xmath17 represents the forces between the particles .",
    "the mass of the particles is taken to be one .",
    "the shear rate is constant , but @xmath5 is not .",
    "it is constructed such that the kinetic energy @xmath18 in the system is exactly constant , which gives @xmath19 this is the iso - kinetic gaussian thermostat .",
    "note that @xmath5 depends on the positions and momenta of all the particles .",
    "the interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1 ] ) is that @xmath20 is the peculiar velocity of particle @xmath4 with respect to the local fluid element that has velocity @xmath12 . in the laboratory frame , a reasonable set of equations to write down",
    "is @xmath21 this particular form of the thermostat term is chosen because a linear velocity profile is expected , and we want the temperature to be constant , so the kinetic energy in the frame that moves with that local velocity is to be dissipated . a boltzmann equation for the one - particle distribution function will give an appropriate description at low densities .",
    "this equation has to be supplemented by the boundary condition that the average velocities at the boundaries @xmath22 are @xmath23 .",
    "to get rid of the @xmath13 dependence , one can transform the velocities to peculiar velocities : @xmath24 .",
    "the average ( peculiar ) velocity now has to be zero at the boundaries , so when @xmath25 they have to be zero at infinity : this is the same boundary condition as for the standard boltzmann equation .",
    "the transformation to peculiar velocities yields the sllod equations : @xmath26 @xmath27",
    "the gaussian thermostat involves an @xmath5 which depends on the position and velocity of every particle , and so it varies in time .",
    "we ll now derive equations of motion for the thermostat for which we do not need to know all these positions and velocities , by introducing one extra thermostat variable @xmath28 .",
    "the derivation is in two steps : first we consider free flight , and then we take into account the effect of collisions .    during free flight @xmath29 is zero so the thermostat is given by @xmath30 using the equations of motions , one finds that the time derivative is @xmath31 where we ve defined the last part as the second thermostat variable @xmath28 : @xmath32 we combine these to the thermostat vector @xmath33 .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath28 is expressable again in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath28 : @xmath34 there is a conserved quantity @xmath35 after change of variables to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , this conserved quantity takes on a hamiltonian form @xmath38 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the general solution , transformed back to @xmath41 , has the form @xmath42 with @xmath43 a constant .",
    "so far , we only considered free flight .",
    "the duration of a free flight is very small in a system of @xmath0 particles : it is of the order of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the collision frequency of a single particle . in a collision ,",
    "@xmath41 changes by an amount : @xmath46 where primes denote the value of the variables after collisions and @xmath47 is the collision parameter , i.e.  @xmath48 . as @xmath49 is of order @xmath0 , @xmath50 is of order @xmath51 . @xmath41",
    "itself is of order one .",
    "the definition makes @xmath52 of order one . during a typical free flight time of one particle , every particle in the system",
    "has collided once on average . in each collision",
    "two particles are involved , so @xmath53 collisions have taken place in the system during this time .",
    "thus , during one free flight time , the thermostat got @xmath53 changes of order @xmath51 and this adds up to an effect of order one , because , as we will see , the average of @xmath50 is non - zero .",
    "we will see later that the effect of the thermostat depending on all the particles  an unphysical idea in some sense  results just in a fluctuating thermostat with well defined mean and distribution .",
    "we are interested in this distribution .",
    "it will depend on the distribution of @xmath54 , which depends on the velocity distribution in the system , which in turn is affected by the thermostat distribution .",
    "but some general properties can already be derived without this subtle interplay .",
    "we want to write down a boltzmann equation for the probability distribution function @xmath55 of the thermostat : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphadot ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : betadot ] ) .",
    "the collision integral counts the number of states that are lost and gained in collisions : @xmath58 in which @xmath59 is the joint distribution of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath41 , and @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is the rate of collisions with @xmath47 given that the colliding particles have relative velocity @xmath65 .",
    "it can be expressed in the differential cross section @xmath66 , which measures the number of deflected particles per unit solid angle around @xmath67 when a beam of particles of unit density is incident on one other particle . in @xmath7",
    "dimensions : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the last factor is the jacobian that arises because we integrate over @xmath47 while @xmath70 is defined per unit solid angle of @xmath67 .",
    "strictly , we ought to take @xmath71 instead of @xmath65 , but in the boltzmann approach the two particles are taken at the same position when they collide . in an enskog - type approach this would matter .    to proceed , we need an expression for @xmath59 in terms of @xmath72 and the one particle distribution function @xmath73 , which we will take normalized to one . for @xmath74 , we can also write down a boltzmann equation , so we will have a system of two coupled boltzmann equations for @xmath74 and @xmath72 . to derive the standard boltzmann equation@xcite for @xmath74 , one uses the stosszahlansatz that states that the two - particle distribution function @xmath75 is proportional to the product of the one particle distribution functions @xmath76 , i.e.  that the two particles are uncorrelated when they collide .",
    "we want a generalization of the stosszahlansatz for @xmath59 , but setting @xmath77 ca nt quite be right for the following reason .",
    "the stosszahlansatz can be generated by taking the phase space density @xmath78 to be @xmath79 , i.e.  all the particles are uncorrelated ( arguably , this is too strong a condition , but it will serve to make our point ) .",
    "let @xmath80 such that @xmath81 then the quantity @xmath82 factorizes , because the delta function does nt involve @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "one easily derives that @xmath85 and this does nt factorize .    @xmath59 does however factorize to zeroth order when we expand in @xmath51 . to see this",

    "[ fig : phasespace ] , both with and without the effect of collisions .",
    "when @xmath100 , it is no longer possible to derive the equations of motion from a hamiltonian : the motion is dissipative , and there exists a fixed point @xmath101 , defined by @xmath102 physically , one expects the system to heat up without a thermostat , so the thermostat should act as a friction : @xmath103 is positive . to consider the stability of the fixed point , we linearize the equation of motion around it . writing @xmath104 , we get @xmath105 the eigenvalues of the matrix are @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 is positive , so the fixed point is stable only if @xmath108 , consistent with the physical expectation .",

    "( [ eq : beta ] ) , one can see that @xmath109 , so the eigenvalues are complex and the fixed point is a stable spiral .",
    "if we take an initial distribution within the domain of attraction , all points will end up in this fixed point . thus , in the stationary state , the distribution of the thermostat is a delta function at @xmath110 : @xmath111      as we mentioned , the analysis is not complete without a second boltzmann equation , for the one particle distribution function @xmath112 . the difficult part",
    "a priori is what to do with the free flight term @xmath113 .",
    "the analysis of the thermostat variables however showed that the @xmath5 is , in the stationary case , a constant , so we just replace @xmath5 by @xmath114 : @xmath115 f\\right\\ } = j(f , f),\\ ] ] where we considered again only the uniform case .",
    "for the stationary case we are interested in , also the time derivative disappears .",
    "the collision integral is@xcite @xmath116 in some analytic work@xcite , a constant @xmath5 is also used and its value is determined by demanding that the second moment @xmath117 is a conserved quantity . this yields @xmath118 note that @xmath119 is constant and equal to @xmath120 , so this choice of @xmath5 is very analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "in fact the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fixed ] ) determining the thermostat fixed point , is this @xmath5 , together with @xmath121 to show this we consider @xmath122 and @xmath123 : @xmath124 we insert for @xmath125 the left hand side of the boltzmann equation and find after partial integration @xmath126 @xmath127 combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fixed ] ) , we see that indeed @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : aav ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : bav ] ) , is the self - consistent solution .",
    "when @xmath0 is finite , there are fluctuations around the thermostat value @xmath114 .",
    "one can see that the first correction , on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : star ] ) has a diffusive form , with a diffusion coefficient of order @xmath51 . combined with the drift towards a fixed point from the left hand side , this will make the thermostat distribution @xmath72 peaked around this point , with a width of order @xmath131 . for large @xmath0",
    "the width is so small that the linearized equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrixl ] ) is a good approximation for most of the distribution . for a linear fixed point",
    ", the distribution would be gaussian .",
    "so the distribution @xmath132 will become gaussian for large @xmath0 , except in the tails , where the linearized equation does not hold .",
    "the gaussian nature of the distribution also carries over to the finite time average of @xmath5 , @xmath133 for large times @xmath134 , the thermostat will spend a long time in the neighborhood of the fixed point @xmath128 , so @xmath135 will also be gaussian distributed for large @xmath0 , but , again , with deviations for large fluctuations .",
    "this all is in accordance with what one would expect from a central limit theorem .",
    "bonetto _ et al._@xcite find a gaussian distribution for @xmath135 , but mention that the gaussian was not what they expected , in fact , that it could nt be gaussian , because it would give a kind of generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation ( see also @xcite ) when combined with the fluctuation theorem of gallavotti and cohen@xcite .",
    "however , the deviations from the gaussian nature at large fluctuations prohibit this derivation of far - from - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations .",
    "the fluctuation theorem states that the probability @xmath136 of finding that @xmath135 is @xmath137 , divided by the probability that it is @xmath138 , satisfies for large @xmath134 , @xmath139.\\ ] ] the result was found for anosov systems , but has been found in numerical simulations @xcite and in langevin equations@xcite too , and seems to have a broader validity@xcite .",
    "combined with a gaussian form of @xmath140 , one gets a relation between the variance and the mean of the distribution , i.e.  a kind of fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "the variance can be linked to a correlation function and ( generalized ) green - kubo formulas emerge@xcite .",
    "but for these to hold , the gaussian character has to be guaranteed for negative @xmath135 also , and the central limit theorem , nor an extension of the analysis given here , could justify that .",
    "recently this was acknowledged by searles and evans@xcite and the green - kubo relations far from equilibrium were refuted in their molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "this does not totally explain the results of bonetto _",
    "et al_@xcite , who get a gaussian @xmath141 for just 10 particles , the gaussian clearly covering negative @xmath142 as well .",
    "there are of course uninvestigated prefactors in the widths of the gaussian and in range of validity .    only when we are near equilibrium the fluctuation theorem and the central limit theorem can be combined , provided we first take the limit of the external field going to zero before we take the thermodynamic limit , even though we can take a large number of particles throughout .",
    "in such a scheme , the distribution @xmath136 is centered almost around zero , such that it always applies to some negative @xmath142 .",
    "we have treated the gaussian thermostat in a sheared system of short range interacting particles at low density using kinetic equations .",
    "we found that in the thermodynamic limit , the thermostat force becomes a friction force with a constant friction coefficient .",
    "the value of this constant was shown to be consistent with the requirement that the second moment of the one particle distribution function is conserved .",
    "this conclusion did not depend on a smallness of the shear rate , so it applies also far from equilibrium .",
    "the constant friction force has been used in other work@xcite and the results from those should apply equally to gaussian thermostatted systems , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we briefly discussed finite @xmath0 corrections .",
    "these give rise to fluctuations of the friction coefficient around its mean , of the order of @xmath143 .",
    "the fluctuations are close to gaussian for large @xmath0 , except for very large fluctuations away from the mean .",
    "far - from - equilibrium green - kubo relations rely in one derivation at least@xcite on the fluctuation theorem@xcite , which concerns large fluctuations .",
    "the breakdown of such green - kubo relations recently found by searles and evans@xcite has its origin in the deviations from the gaussian nature for large fluctuations . near equilibrium one does nt need the large fluctuations",
