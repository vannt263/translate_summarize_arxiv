    "the models obtained from modifying general relativity theory are viable candidates to explain the current cosmic acceleration , which was first discovered from the supernova observations  @xcite and then further confirmed by many other cosmological tests , including the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite and the large scale structure  @xcite , and so on .",
    "one such modification to general relativity is the @xmath1 theory  ( see @xcite for recent review ) , where the ricci scalar @xmath2 in the einstein - hilbert action is generalized to an arbitrary function @xmath3 of @xmath2 .",
    "recently , a new modified gravity to account for the cosmic accelerating expansion , named @xmath0 theory , is proposed by extending the action of teleparallel gravity  @xcite in analogy to the @xmath1 theory , where @xmath4 is the torsion scalar .",
    "the teleparallel theory of gravity is built on teleparallel geometry , which was first introduced by einstein to unify gravity and electromagnetism  @xcite and then was revived as a geometrical alternative to the riemannian geometry of general relativity  @xcite . in teleparallel geometry , the weitzenbck connection rather than the levi - civita connection is used . as a result , the spacetime has only torsion and thus is curvature - free .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the @xmath0 theory can not only explain the present cosmic acceleration with no need of dark energy  @xcite , but also provide an alternative to inflation without an inflaton  @xcite .",
    "it therefore has attracted some attention recently . in this",
    "regard , linder  @xcite proposed two new @xmath0 models to explain the present cosmic accelerating expansion and found that the @xmath0 theory can unify a number of interesting extensions of gravity beyond general relativity .",
    "we performed a statefinder diagnostic to these two models and also placed observational constraints on them from the latest data  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a reconstruction of @xmath0 theory from the background expansion history and the @xmath0 theory driven by scalar fields have been studied  @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we plan to analyze the dynamical property of @xmath0 theory .",
    "in teleparallel gravity , the dynamical object is the vierbein @xmath5 , which has the property , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the inverse matrix of vierbein , @xmath8 is an index running over @xmath9 for the tangent space of the manifold , and @xmath10 , also running over @xmath9 , is the coordinate index on the manifold .",
    "this vierbein relates with the metric through @xmath11 where @xmath12 .    as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "teleparallel gravity uses the curvatureless weitzenbck connection , which is defined as @xmath13 from this weitzenbck connection , one can introduce a non - null torsion tensor @xmath14 , @xmath15 the torsion scalar @xmath4 in the action of teleparallel gravity is then given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the contorsion tensor , @xmath19    for a flat homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker universe described by the metric @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scale factor , one has , from eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) , @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the hubble parameter .",
    "the action of @xmath0 theory is obtained by replacing @xmath4 in the action of teleparallel gravity by @xmath24 .",
    "varying this action with respect to the vierbein , we obtain the field equation of @xmath0 gravity , which leads to the following modified friedmann equation @xmath25 @xmath26 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath27 , subscript @xmath4 , a derivative with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath28 is the energy density and @xmath29 is the pressure .",
    "here we assume that the energy components in the universe are matter and radiation , thus @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the energy densities of matter and radiation , respectively .    from eqs .",
    "( [ mf ] , [ mf2 ] ) , we can define an effective dark energy , whose energy density and the equation of state can be expressed , respectively , as , @xmath33 @xmath34",
    "in order to analyze the dynamics of a general @xmath0 model , we rewrite the equations of motion as a dynamical system with the following dimensionless variables : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dimensionless energy density parameter of radiation . using eqs .",
    "( [ mf ] , [ mf2 ] ) and the energy conservation equations of matter and radiation , one can obtain @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath27 and @xmath40 defining @xmath41 , one can express @xmath4 as a function of @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) . and",
    "then @xmath44 can be expressed in terms of @xmath42 .",
    "for example , the model , @xmath45^q$ ] , yields @xmath46 .",
    "thus , for a given form of @xmath0 , the dynamical system given in eqs .",
    "( [ x ] , [ y ] , [ z ] ) becomes autonomous .",
    "using @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) and @xmath50 can be rewritten as @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the dimensionless density parameter of matter .    in order to analyze the dynamical properties of system given in eqs .",
    "( [ x ] , [ y ] , [ z ] ) , we should firstly solve these equations with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . here , besides two isolated critical points ( denoted as point a and point b ) , we also get a continuous line of critical points , which is called as line c : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 one can see that line c is a straight line in the phase space .    @xmath60 point a : radiation dominated point    at this critical point , we have @xmath61 which corresponds to a radiation dominated phase .",
    "now we examine the stability of this point , which is determined by the eigenvalues of the linearized system . after some calculations , we find the eigenvalues at point a , @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "this critical point is unstable because there is a positive eigenvalue .",
    "@xmath60 point b : matter dominated point    using eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) , one has @xmath64 at this critical point .",
    "thus , it represents a matted dominated era . through the same calculation as that in point a",
    ", we obtain that the eigenvalues of the linearized system at this point are , @xmath65 for a successful cosmological scenario , this point must be unstable so that the universes can exit from the the matter dominated era .",
    "this means that the real part of one of the eigenvalues in the above expression must be positive .",
    "this may be possible for a given @xmath0 model as long as the model parameters satisfy certain conditions .",
    "@xmath60 line c : effective dark energy dominated era    at this critical line , we have @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 substituting eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) into ( [ mf2 ] ) and considering @xmath69 and @xmath70 , one can find easily that @xmath71 thus , line c corresponds to a de sitter phase , if @xmath72 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the linearized system at this critical line are , @xmath73 it is easy to see that line c is always stable .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath0 model , the universe finally enters a de sitter phase .",
    "now we consider a concrete power law model given in  @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are two model parameters . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been pointed out that this model has the same background evolution equation as some phenomenological models  @xcite and it reduces to the @xmath77cdm model when @xmath78 , and to the dgp model  @xcite when @xmath79 . when @xmath80 , the friedmann equation ( eq .  ( [ mf ] ) ) can be rewritten as @xmath81 , which is the same as that of a standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model if we rescale the newton s constant as @xmath82 .",
    "thus , next , we will focus our attention on the case of @xmath83 .",
    "let us note that , in order to be consistent with the present observational results , it is required that @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ pl ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) , one can show that , when @xmath83 , the case @xmath69 ( line c ) gives that the hubble parameter is a non - zero constant , which corresponds to a de sitter phase . using eq .",
    "( [ dm ] ) , we have @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the eigenvalues at critical point b becomes @xmath87 which means that critical point b is always unstable and its stability is independent of the value of model parameter @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , for a power law model , we find that , if @xmath83 , the universe is able to evolve from a radiation dominated era to a matter dominated one , and finally enter an exponential expansion phase . in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , we show the cosmic evolution with different initial conditions .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 at @xmath92 , where @xmath92 is the initial value of scale factor ) must be very very small to have a long enough period of radiation domination give the correct primordial nucleosynthesis and radiation - matter equality , and to ensure the appearance of a matter dominated phase , otherwise the universe has unusual early behavior and evolves directly from radiation dominated phase to a de - sitter one .",
    "thus , for the power law @xmath0 model , the conditions for the universe to evolve to a cosmic accelerating expansion and have usual early behavior are @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath83 .",
    "note , however , that in order to satisfy the current observations constraints , @xmath95 is still required  @xcite .     the cosmic evolution for the case of power law model with @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath92 is the initial value of the scalar factor .",
    "the dot - dashed , solid , and dashed lines correspond to the evolutionary of curves of @xmath97 , @xmath53 and the dimensionless density parameter of the effective dark energy , respectively . in left panel",
    "the initial conditions are set as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , while in right panel they are @xmath100 and @xmath99.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] the cosmic evolution for the case of power law model with @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath92 is the initial value of the scalar factor .",
    "the dot - dashed , solid , and dashed lines correspond to the evolutionary of curves of @xmath97 , @xmath53 and the dimensionless density parameter of the effective dark energy , respectively . in left panel",
    "the initial conditions are set as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , while in right panel they are @xmath100 and @xmath99.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "the @xmath0 theory , obtained from generalizing teleparallel gravity , is a new modified gravity capable of accounting for the present cosmic accelerating expansion with no need of dark energy . in this letter",
    ", we analyze the dynamical behavior of the @xmath0 theory by assuming the existence of matter and radiation in our universe . two critical points ( point a and point b ) , corresponding to a matter dominated phase and a radiation dominated one , respectively , and a critical line ( line c ) , corresponding to an effective dark energy dominated era , are found .",
    "we find that both point a and point b are unstable while line c is always stable .",
    "thus , the universe can finally enter a de sitter expansion phase , if @xmath101 is nonzero at the critical line c. for a power law model , the case @xmath83 is considered since @xmath80 corresponds to a scdm model if we rescale the newton s constant as @xmath82 .",
    "the results show that , if @xmath83 , the final state of our universe in the @xmath0 theory is an exponential expansion since @xmath101 is a nonzero constant at line c. in addition , we find that , to obtain the usual early universe behavior , it is required that @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 at @xmath92 ) should be very very small .",
    "thus , for the power law model , the conditions to have a successful cosmological scenario are that @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath83 .",
    "but , according to the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath95 is required in order to be consistent with current observations .",
