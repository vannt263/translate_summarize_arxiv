    "the intensity anisotropy pattern of the cmbr has already been measured to an extraordinary precision , which helped significantly to establish the current cosmological paradigm of a flat universe with a period of inflation in its first moments and the existence of the so called dark energy @xcite .",
    "the polarization anisotropies of the cmbr are an order of magnitude smaller than the intensity anisotropies and provide partly complementary information .",
    "the polarization pattern is divided into two distinct components termed e- and b - modes which are scalar ( pseudoscalar ) fields .",
    "the e - modes originate from the dynamics due to the density inhomogeneities in the early universe .",
    "the b - modes are caused by lensing of the e - modes by the matter in the line of sight and by gravitational waves in the inflationary period in the very early universe and are expected to be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the e - modes .",
    "the status of the e - mode measurements is summarized in figure [ emodes ] from which it becomes obvious that the measurements are consistent with the theoretical model but not yet giving meaningful constraints .",
    "of special importance and interest are the b - modes expected from gravitational waves in the inflationary epoch , since a detection would allow unique access to the very first moments of the universe .",
    "the size of this contribution can not be predicted by theory , but is parametrized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "interesting inflationary energy scales of the order of the grand unifying theory ( gut ) scale of 10@xmath2 gev correspond to an @xmath1 of @xmath310@xmath0 , which would give rise to detectable signals of a few 10  nk .",
    "the tiny signal requires unprecedented sensitivity and control of systematics and foregrounds . by",
    "now receivers have reached sensitivities close to fundamental limits , so that the sensitivity will only be increased with the number of receivers .",
    "recent developments at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) led to the successful integration of the relevant components of a polarization - sensitive pseudo - correlation receiver at 90 and 40  ghz in a small chip package .",
    "this opened the way to future inexpensive mass production of large coherent receiver arrays and led to the formation of the q / u imaging experiment ( quiet ) collaboration .",
    "experimental groups from 12 international institutes have joined the experiment and are working on the first prototype arrays which are planned for deployment for 2008 in chile .",
    "a w - band ( 90 ghz ) array of 91 receivers and a q - band ( 40 ghz ) array of 19 receivers will be deployed on new 1.4 m telescopes mounted on the existing platform of the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) in the atacama desert at an altitude of 5080  m. it is foreseen to expand the arrays for a second phase of data taking ( 2010++ ) to arrays with 1000 receivers . for the expansion it is planned to mount more 1.4  m telescopes on the platform and relocate the 7 m crawford hill antenna from new jersey to chile to also access small angular scales .",
    "a sketch of one receiver and its components can be seen in figure [ receiver ] .",
    "the incoming radiation couples via a feedhorn to an orthomode transducer ( omt ) and from that to the two input waveguides of the chip package .",
    "the chip contains a complete radiometer with high electron mobility transistors ( hemts ) implemented as monolithic microwave integrated circuits ( mmics ) , phase shifters , hybrid couplers and diodes .",
    "the outputs of the four diodes of the radiometer provide measurements of the stokes parameters q and u and fast ( 4khz ) phase switching reduces the effects of the 1/f drifts of the amplifiers . for 10@xmath4 of the receivers",
    "the omt will be exchanged by a magic tee assembled in a way that the receivers measure temperature differences between neighboured feeds .",
    "the signals from the diodes are processed by a digital backend , sampling at 800  khz with subsequent digital demodulation .",
    "this allows unique monitoring of high - frequency noise as well as the production of null - data sets with out - of - phase demodulation giving a valuable check of possible subtle systematics .",
    "the receiver arrays together with the feedhorns are assembled in large cryostats and the chip radiometers are kept at 20  k to ensure low noise from the hemts .    for a single element a bandwidth of 18(8 )  ghz and a noise temperature of 45 ( 20 ) k is aimed for at 90 ( 40 ) ghz , leading to expected sensitivites in chile of 250 ( 160 ) @xmath5k@xmath6 per element .",
    "a prototype array of 7 elements with one omt mounted on top of one chip radiometer is shown on the right hand side of figure [ receiver ] .",
    "the hexagonal prototype arrays of 91 and 19 elements are being assembled from similar subarrays .",
    "the omts were built in cost - effective split - block technique and the corrugated horn arrays were produced as platelet arrays where 100 plates with feed - hole patterns are mounted together by diffusion bonding .",
    "the increase in sensitivity is a necessary but not yet sufficient condition for the successful measurement of b - modes as the signal of interest is smaller than the one from astrophysical foregrounds .",
    "the diffuse emission ( synchrotron , dust ) from our galaxy and extragalactic sources produces polarized signals of which the distribution and characteristics are not yet known to the precision required for a full removal .",
    "multifrequency observations are mandatory to study the foreground behaviour and enable the clean extraction of the cmbr polarization anisotropies .",
    "quiet in its observations will use two frequencies which frame the frequency where the contamination from foregrounds in polarization is expected to be minimal , around 70  ghz . also , it will coordinate the patches to be observed with other polarization experiments to gain additional frequency information .",
    "fields were selected in which minimal foreground contamination is expected .",
    "the b - modes from gravitational waves will suffer from yet another foreground ( which in intself is of scientific interest ) which is the lensing of e - modes into b - modes .",
    "using the observations at small angular scales quiet will be able to determine a lensing correction and , with that , be able to remove that contribution properly .",
    "while currently ongoing cmbr experiments ( bicep , quad ) are running with tens of receivers all future experiments are aiming for large arrays with several hundreds of receivers , all of them ( but quiet ) using bolometers .",
    "figure [ comparison ] visualizes the main parameters of quiet in comparison to other ongoing and planned cmb experiments ( no interferometers are shown ) .",
    "some of the experiments have their main focus on observations of the sunyaev zeldovich effect ( marked accordingly ) and not polarization observations , but may still upgrade their detector arrays for polarization sensitivity .",
    "the parameters of the future experiments were taken from recent papers and talks about the various efforts , but since some of the technologies are not yet fully established and not all of the experiments are completely funded , it is clear that some of the parameters may change in the course of the production . both the left and middle plot display beam size versus frequency for the different experiments while the size of the squares indicates different parameters of the experiments .",
    "since some experiments ( quiet , polarbear ) are planned to operate in different phases , they have several squares at the same position . in the left panel",
    "the square area is proportional to the total sensitivity of the experiments , which means the smaller the square the more sensitive the experiment .",
    "as can be seen the next generation of cmb experiments will achieve the desired level of a few nk sensitivity .    except for the space - based mission",
    "planck and the balloon experiment spider all ground - based experiments focus their sensitivity on small fractions of the sky . in this way it is possible to avoid",
    "regions of high foreground contamination and also gain a higher signal - to - noise ratio in the maps , which helps characterizing foregrounds and systematics . in order to compare the sensitivity on a map the middle figure displays squares which are in size proportional to the sensitivity in @xmath5k / square degree .",
    "the right figure then shows the corresponding white noise level for the different polarization experiments as a function of multipole l in comparison to the different polarization power spectra .",
    "as can be seen the white noise power is for planck a factor of 100 higher than for the ground - based experiments , which means the noise on a quiet map is about one order of magnitude lower than on the maps expected from planck .",
    "the main sensitivity of planck for the measurement of b - modes from gravitational waves comes from the reionization peak at low multipoles of l while the ground - based experiments like quiet will constrain @xmath1 from measuring at the maximum of the gravitational wave signal at @xmath7=100 , corresponding to an angular scale of 2  degrees .",
    "quiet is complementary to other experiments in many different ways :    * quiet is the only ground - based effort using coherent receivers and thus dealing with different systematics than the bolometric systems . *",
    "it is the only experiment to measure the stokes parameters q and u simultaneously in one pixel which provides a good handle on several systematic effects . *",
    "the array at 40 ghz complements the high frequencies of the bolometer arrays and thus allows to account for the contamination from synchrotron radiation which dominates at low frequencies .",
    "* by using different telescope sizes quiet will be able to measure both large and small angular scales with the same receivers .",
    "= 0.36 ( lensing contribution not shown).,width=449 ]    already in phase i quiet will be able to measure the e - mode spectrum to an unprecedented precision . the expected e- and b - mode power spectra for the phase ii of quiet with 1000 elements are shown in figure [ powspec ] .",
    "only the sensitivity of the w - band ( 90 ghz ) arrays from the 1.4  m telescopes was used assuming that the q - band sensitivity is used for foreground removal .",
    "the results were derived by including several real - data effects : a realistic observing strategy has been simulated and the method used in capmap to remove ground - pickup by mode - removal in single scans has been applied @xcite . the simulations also incorporate effects from e - b leakage where the b - mode measurement is degraded due to the e - mode signal leakage into the b - mode spectrum due to the finite size of the observed patch @xcite .",
    "additionally , the errors include a marginalization over the power in adjacent @xmath7-bins and for b - modes also over e power .",
    "the expected precision on cosmological parameters assuming initial adiabatic conditions is summarized in table [ cosmpar ] .",
    "note that these estimates had been performed before the publication of wmap results , but do agree well with the published wmap parameter errors . from the table",
    "one can see that quiet will improve the wmap parameter errors to a size competitive to the expected precision of planck . adding",
    "the quiet measurements to planck will only bring a small improvement in most of the parameters",
    ". however , quiet will already in phase i be able to constrain the tensor - to - scalar ratio together with planck to a level significantly smaller than planck is expected to . adding quiet phase ii will bring the limit on @xmath1 down to the level of 10@xmath0 .",
