    "buildings were introduced by tits @xcite for the purpose of creating a unified class of geometric objects upon which groups of lie type act , and from which such groups arise as automorphism groups .",
    "this highly successful project has led to a rich and elaborate theory , interweaving group theory , geometry and combinatorics , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    from a purely combinatorial point of view , buildings can be defined and characterized in two ways .",
    "first , they are highly symmetric _ simplicial complexes_. they arise by gluing together coxeter complexes in a very symmetric way and can be interpreted as @xmath2-analogues of coxeter complexes .",
    "the maximal simplices are called _ chambers _ and the embedded coxeter complexes are called _ apartments_. this is the original point of view of tits @xcite .",
    "second , focussing on the chambers and their adjacency relation as the primitive objects of the theory , buildings can be characterized as a class of _ chamber systems_. this means that one looks at the structure of the chamber graph , whose edges are the pairs of adjacent chambers , embellished by certain labelling of these edges .",
    "the chamber system point of view was introduced by tits in later work and is exposited e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the axioms for the system of apartments indicate that a building is very tightly held together .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect also a high degree of connectivity of its chamber graph , as measured by the number of pairwise disjoint paths ( or , galleries ) that connect any pair of chambers .",
    "if at least @xmath2 pairwise disjoint paths connect any pair of chambers , then the chamber graph is said to be _",
    "the maximal such @xmath2 is the degree of connectivity of the graph .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the chamber graph @xmath1 of a finite ( or , more generally , thick spherical and locally finite ) building @xmath0 is @xmath4-connected in the sense of graph theory . here",
    "@xmath4 denotes the number of chambers adjacent to any given chamber of @xmath0 .",
    "since more than @xmath4 independent paths can not leave a chamber , it follows that the result is sharp , meaning that @xmath4 is the exact degree of connectivity of the chamber graph .",
    "coxeter complexes are closely related to buildings .",
    "they appear as apartments in buildings as well as in many other contexts .",
    "we show for a large class of @xmath5-dimensional coxeter complexes that their chamber graph is @xmath6-connected .",
    "this class includes , for example , the complexes of the classical affine coxeter groups .",
    "our method is constructive and relies strongly on the group structure behind the coxeter complexes .",
    "the buildings and the coxeter complexes of type a are , respectively , the order complexes of subspace lattices of finite - dimensional vector spaces over some field , and the boolean lattices of subsets of some finite set . both these types of lattices are examples of geometric lattices . in the last section",
    "we extend the study to chamber graphs of order complexes for general geometric lattices .",
    "again , we can prove a lower bound on the connectivity of the graph of those complexes .",
    "however , in this case the graphs need not be regular anymore and the bound needs not be sharp .",
    "we establish the graph - theoretic notions that are relevant for this paper .",

    "two @xmath11 paths are _ disjoint _ if the sets of their interior vertices are disjoint .",

    "it is clear that in a @xmath22-connected graph every vertex is incident to at least @xmath22 edges . a well - known theorem by menger ( * ?",
    "* theorem 3.3.6 ) , valid also for infinite graphs , states that a graph is @xmath22-connected if and only if it contains @xmath22 disjoint @xmath21 paths for any two vertices @xmath24 .",
