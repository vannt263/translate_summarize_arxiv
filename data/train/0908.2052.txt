    "the goal of this work was to obtain the charge form factor and charge radius of triton , as a three - body bound state , that are obtained by using eft .",
    "we applied the formalism developed to the computation of processes involving external currents such as , triton charge form factor and charge radii .",
    "we considered the diagrams needed to be computed and the charge form factor numerically obtained by perturbatively solving of faddeev equation , up to n@xmath0lo . at very low energies ,",
    "the interactions between nucleons can be only described by point - like interactions .",
    "the present study of the triton charge form factor show that it is possible to obtain remarkably good predictions for electrogenic structure functions of the few - body bound states by using eft at very low - energies .",
    "the charge form factor of triton at low energies was calculated by using pionless eft and simple inclusion of external currents .",
    "the charge radii is also calculated up to n@xmath0lo .",
    "the triton binding energy and nd scattering length in the triton channel have been used to fix them .",
    "hence the triton charge radii is in total determined as @xmath4[1.959(lo)-0.113(nlo)-0.071(n@xmath0lo)]fm = [ 1.775 @xmath5 0.02 ] fm .",
    "it converges order by order in low energy expansion and is also cut - off independent at this order .",
