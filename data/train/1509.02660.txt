    "these translate to a mean distance estimate of 17.2 @xmath8 7 kpc . clearly , a large distance to the nova is suggested .",
    "the possibility is unlikely that the distance estimate is being boosted up because of a low choice of extinction @xmath27 in the distance - modulus relation @xmath28 .",
    "the extinction of 2.9 that we have used is close to the total galactic extinction of 2.995 mag in the direction of the nova as estimated by schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) from dust extinction maps .",
    "our choice of a@xmath26 is also consistent with the extinction modeling of marshall et al ( 2006 ) who find that the extinction a@xmath26 rapidly rises , in the direction of the nova , to 3.36 @xmath8 0.33 by a distance of 1.23 kpc and remains at this value for larger distances .",
    "the j , h and k band spectra for nova cep 2014 are shown in fig  [ ncep14_spec_jhk ] .",
    "these show that the outburst and evolution of nova cep 2014 was that of a conventional fe ii class nova .",
    "the spectra of such novae , in the near - ir , are characterized by strong hi lines of the paschen and brackett series but what differentiates them from the he / n class is the presence of several strong ci lines seen around maximum and during the early decline ( banerjee & ashok , 2012 ) .",
    "these ci lines are all prominently seen in the spectrum of nova cep 2014 ( examples being ci 1.0685 , 1.165 , 1.176 @xmath13 m and a strong blend of ci lines in the region 1.73 to 1.78 @xmath13 m ) .",

    "we find that the line fluxes do not match predicted case b recombination values . in particular , it is seen from fig  [ ncep14_recombanalysis ] that the br7 ( br@xmath38 ) line strength is significantly lower than the predicted values of storey & hummer ( 1995 ) . though expected to be stronger than the other br series of lines , it is found to be significantly weaker than for e.g br10 and br11 .",

    "the impact of the high - velocity nova ejecta with the wind of the giant companion is known to produce a strong shock which can heat the gas to high temperatures .",
    "this hot , shocked gas can be the site of hard x - rays ( sokolski et al . 2006 ; bode et al . 2006 ) and also @xmath38-ray production created by diffusive acceleration of particles across the shock to tev energies .",
    "the accelerated protons can subsequently either inverse - comptonize ambient low - energy radiation to the @xmath38 ray regime or participate in production of neutral pions which decay with the emission of gamma rays . the early x - ray and radio observations of nova sco 2015 by nelson",
    "et al ( 2015 ) implicate the presence of such a strong shock forming in the red giant wind .",
    "bode & kahn ( 1985 ) , for e.g. , have discussed the propagation of such a shock wave into the dense ambient medium surrounding the white dwarf .",
    "it may be described as a three stage process viz .",
    "a free expansion or ejecta dominated stage where the ejecta expands freely into the red giant wind .",
    "this phase lasts till the mass of the swept - up material from the donor wind is smaller than the mass of the the nova ejecta . a constant velocity of the shock is seen during this time . 2 .",
    "an adiabatic phase or sedov - taylor stage where the majority of the ejecta kinetic energy has been transferred to the swept - up ambient gas and there is negligible cooling by radiation losses .",
    "this phase is characterized by the temporal evolution of shock velocity @xmath59 as @xmath90 , assuming a @xmath91 dependence for the decrease in density of the wind .",
    "3 .   in phase 3 ,",
    "the shocked material has cooled by radiation , and here the expected dependence of the shock velocity is @xmath92 .    in the case of nova sco 2015 the free expansion stage ,",
    "if it occurred in the first instance , is clearly missed .",
    "this is possibly because our observations began late viz .",
    "our earliest spectrum being recorded 7 days after the outburst .",
    "the deceleration that accompanies phases 2 or 3 is seen but the decay is too fast and the index @xmath93 that we get deviates substantially from that expected in either phase 2 or 3 .",
    "such deviations were also noticed in other recurrent novae as well e.g. rs oph ( das et al .",
    "2006 ) , v745 sco ( banerjee et al . 2014 ) .",
    "this likely happens due to the propagation of ejecta into a non - symmetrical wind . in such cases ,",
    "the ejecta would be slowed down more effectively in the parts moving in the direction of the giant due to the increasing density in that direction .",
    "in addition there could be anisotropic distribution of the material over the equatorial plane .",
    "thus as a combination , the mass distribution of the ejecta around the white dwarf would be anisotropic and the shock front would then propagate as an aspherical one ( chomiuk et al .",
    "2012 , fig 6 therein ) .",
    "this nova possibly has a bipolar flow associated with it based on the description of the early optical spectrum by walter ( 2015 ) where , apart from the main central feature , symmetrically displaced emission features at about @xmath8 4500 kms@xmath4 were seen in the h@xmath0 profile .",
    "such a profile structure is typical of a bipolar flow and has been seen in quite a few novae viz .",
    "rs oph ( banerjee et al . 2009 ) , kt eri 2009 ( ribeiro et al , 2013 ; raj et al .",
    "2013 ) , t pyx ( joshi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . from our own data ,",
    "indication for an asymmetrical ejecta flow also comes from the velocity profiles of the pa@xmath38 @xmath94 m , pa@xmath5 @xmath95 m and br@xmath38 @xmath96 m lines shown in fig  [ fig_nsco_velplot ] . here a weak blue component is seen in each of the profiles , separated from the principal profile , by -650 , -765 , -690 @xmath97 for pa@xmath38 , pa@xmath5 and the br @xmath38 lines respectively .",
    "this could be the blue symmetrically displaced component found by walter ( 2015 ) which has undergone considerable deceleration from its original value of -4000 km / s down to the present value of @xmath7 -600 to -700 km / s .",
    "the intensity of its counterpart red component could have dropped below detection limits . in short , indications are clearly present for deviations from spherical symmetry in the velocity kinematics seen in nova sco 2015 .",
    "this could be one of the reasons for the deviation of the deceleration index @xmath0 from model values .",
    "we have performed the recombination case b analysis following the same lines as done earlier for nova cep 2014 .",
    "we analyze observed spectra spanning 6 epochs covering the first 33 d of our observations .",
    "the measured line strengths from the flux calibrated spectra of n sco 2015 are given in table  [ table_lineluminosity ] .",
    "flux calibrations of the spectra are done using near ir photometric observations from smarts consortium .",
    "fig  [ nsco15_recombanalysis ] shows the observed relative line strengths for the brackett lines which have been normalized with respect to br12 set to unity .",
    "br22 and br23 line values ( as given in table  [ table_lineluminosity ] ) are not considered for this analysis as they are not resolved properly .",
    "the predicted case b values are shown in fig  [ nsco15_recombanalysis ] for a representative temperature 10000 k and for electron number densities of @xmath3 = 10@xmath98 , 10@xmath99 , 10@xmath100 , 10@xmath101,10@xmath102 and 10@xmath103 @xmath104 . as can be seen , in this nova also , the br@xmath38 line is weaker than expected implying it is optically thick .",
    "thus , using the same formalism described for nova cep 2014 , the emission measure @xmath2 is estimated to be in the range of @xmath55 to @xmath56 @xmath57 , the corresponding lower limit of the electron density @xmath3 is in the range @xmath105 @xmath51 to @xmath106 @xmath51 and the mass @xmath68 is between ( @xmath107  @xmath108 ) @xmath69 m@xmath75 where @xmath69 is the filling factor .",

    "as symbiotic systems are rare among novae , identification of a new object likely to belong to this group is of much significance .",
    "the bright near ir counterpart of nova sco 2015 from the 2mass archival database ( 2mass j17032617 - 3504178 ) is likely to be a symbiotic system based on its 2mass magnitudes of @xmath112 , @xmath113 & @xmath114 .",
    "these magnitudes are transformed to bessel & brett ( 1988 ) homogenized system using transformation equations given by carpenter ( 2001 ) and corrected for interstellar extinction using the relations given by rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) .",
    "the ir color indices are thus obtained as @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "these colors are consistent with the values of 0.68 and 0.14 expected for k3 iii / k4 iii respectively ( bessel & brett 1988 ) .",
    "on the other hand the sed in quiescence suggests a slightly different class for the secondary . for constructing the sed",
    ", the wavelength coverage was extended on the either size of the 2mass coverage by using wise w1 and w2 bands data and denis i band data .",
    "it may be noted that the denis magnitudes of @xmath117 = 13.45 @xmath8 0.07 and @xmath118 = 12.20 @xmath8 0.10 are in good agreement with the corresponding 2mass values of 13.40 @xmath8 0.03 and 12.22 @xmath8 0.03 respectively .",
    "the wise w3 and w4 magnitudes were not used for the sed because the star is not seen as a point source in the wise images in these bands , only the background diffuse ir cirrus is being picked up .",
    "the extremely low snr ( between 3 to 6 ) and the poor quality flags of the w3 and w4 data show that they should not be used .",
    "all magnitudes were corrected for interstellar extinction using a@xmath119 = 2.23 .",
    "the sed shown in fig  [ nsco2015_sed ] , using i(0.79 @xmath13 m ) = 15.25 @xmath8 0.04 , w1(3.3 @xmath13 m ) = 11.24 @xmath8 0.03 and w2(4.6@xmath13 m ) = 11.46 @xmath8 0.03 , is well fit by a black body of temperature @xmath120 k , suggesting a spectral class of m4 - 5 iii . considering the spectral class of k3 iii / k4 iii suggested earlier from the near - infrared @xmath121 colors it appears that the determination of the spectral type of the companion is uncertain to few sub - classes @xmath122 at best we can say that range of the likely spectral class is either k or m. to have a more definitive classification , the spectral lines of the secondary must be recorded in a good snr spectrum in quiescence .",
    "further support for the secondary to be in the giant class comes from its absolute magnitude estimation . assuming that the quiescent k band brightness is dominated by the secondary ( i.e m@xmath123 of the secondary = 12.22 from 2mass ) and using the mmrd distance estimate to the nova of @xmath7 14.7 kpc , the k band absolute magnitude of the secondary , is calculated as @xmath124 . whereas using the intricsic color @xmath125 ( bessell & brett 1988 ) and absolute magnitude @xmath126 ( lang 1990 ) for k5 iii spectral class , the corresponding @xmath127 is determined as @xmath128 . as the two are in good agreement , it further strengthens the classification of the secondary as a red giant . on the other hand ,",
    "the possibility of the companion being a dwarf instead of a giant can be ruled out from the following consideration . for a mid - k to mid - m spectral class dwarf as suggested by our previous analyses , the k absolute magnitudes is in the range of @xmath129 respectively ( pecaut & mamajek 2013 ; see online version of table 5 therein ) .",
    "using the distance modulus relation , the corresponding distance range comes out to be @xmath130 pc .",
    "this is severely in disagreement with the distance estimated earlier using mmrd relations .",
    "further for such a close distance range of @xmath130 pc , the extinction versus distance models of marshall et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest that we should get an extinction value of 0.45 for a@xmath119 which is again inconsistent with the observed estimate of 2.23 .    an additional confirmation for the symbiotic nature of nova sco 2015 comes from the comparison of its h@xmath0 and r band images .",
    "the supercosmos archive/ ] h@xmath0 image is considerably brighter than the r band counter part indicating the presence of strong h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the supercosmos values of h@xmath0 and short - r band magnitudes are 15.48 and 16.33 respectively , whereas the mean value of the ( h@xmath0 - short r ) magnitude for about 275 listed sources in a 3 arc - minute square field around the object is found to be @xmath131 . that is , the source is considerably bright in h@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , pronounced h i emission is used as one of the principal criteria for the classification of symbiotic stars ( belczynski et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "this can be seen from the spectra of symbiotic stars , for e.g. in the catalogue of munari & zwitter ( 2002 ) , wherein they are seen to exhibit strong h@xmath0 emission .",
    "however in addition to the presence of hi lines , the other criteria for a definitive symbiotic star classification requires the presence of higher excitation lines ( e.g. [ oiii ] , heii ) . after the system has returned to quiescence , and the nova ejecta faded , it may be checked whether such lines are seen .",
    "we estimate the outburst amplitude of nova sco 2015 by associating the optical counter part nomad-1 0549 - 0492872 with @xmath19 = 17.0 as the progenitor suggested by guido & howes ( 2015 ) .",
    "the @xmath19 = 9.492 near the maximum from the smarts database gives an outburst amplitude ( a ) of @xmath77.5 in the @xmath19 band which is relatively small .",
    "it lies @xmath7 4.5 magnitude below the outburst amplitude ( a ) vs log ( @xmath132 ) plot for classical novae ( warner 1995 ; fig 5.4 ) .    in an extensive study of a large sample of classical novae and the recurrent novae pagnotta & schaefer ( 2014 )",
    "have identified the characteristics common to recurrent novae to identify the potential recurrent novae among the known classical novae .",
    "the data discussed earlier shows that most of these characteristics , namely , small outburst amplitude , near ir colors resembling the colors of late type giant , expansion velocity exceeding 2000 kms@xmath4 and the presence of high excitation lines are fulfilled by nova sco 2015 , thus it presents a strong case for to be a potential recurrent nova .",
    "it is worth noting the similar case of nova sco 2014 , wherein joshi et al ( 2015 ) have shown that the outburst occurred in a symbiotic binary system and also suggested that it could be a recurrent nova .",
    "no @xmath38-ray emission was detected by the fermi observatory from nova sco 2015 or nova sco 2014 ( joshi et al . 2015 ) which are both similar systems .",
    "on the other hand , two other similar symbiotic systems were detected in @xmath38 rays viz .",
    "v407 cyg and v745 sco .",
    "the non - detections in nova sco 2014 and nova sco 2015 could be a consequence of both objects being sufficiently distant that any emission from them falls below the detection threshold of fermi .",
    "but it is desirable to check the fermi data from both these novae carefully for any weak or suggested signs of detection .",
    "this has bearings on the origin of @xmath38-ray emission from novae where the latest paradigm suggests that @xmath38-ray emission could be a generic property of all novae and not intrinsic to just symbiotic systems ( ackermann et al .",
    "novae from which @xmath38-ray emission has been detected , but which are not symbiotic systems , are nova sco 2012 , nova mon 2012 , nova del 2013 and nova cen 2013 .",
    "we present near - infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of nova cep 2014 and nova sco 2015 which were discovered in outburst on 2014 march 8.79 ut and 2015 february 11.84 ut respectively .",
    "our observations for nova cep 2014 cover 9 epochs from 5 to 90 days after outburst and for nova sco 2015 cover 11 epochs covering 7 to 47 days after outburst .",

    "( more details in das et al , 2008 ) the model spectra are generated by considering only those elements whose lines can be expected at discernible strength . since nucleosynthesis calculations of elemental abundances in novae ( starrfield et al .",
    "1997 ; jose @xmath137 hernanz , 1998 ) show that h , he , c , o , n , ne , mg , na , al , si , p , s are the elements with significant yields in novae ejecta , only these elements have been considered .",
    "the saha ionization equation was applied to calculate the fractional percentage of the species in different ionization stages and subsequently the boltzman equation was applied to calculate level populations . by switching off or greatly increasing the abundance of an element , it is easy to identify the positions where the lines of that element disappear or build up .",
    "fig  [ fig_ncep_lineid ] shows the ij band spectrum of nova cep 2014 of 2014 march 20 in black and a typical synthetic lte spectrum in gray below .",
    "the lte spectrum has been computed for @xmath3 = 10@xmath139 @xmath30 , @xmath140 = 8000k and abundances typically found in co novae as given in starrfield et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and jose @xmath137 hernanz ( 1998 ) .",
    "a total of @xmath7 2500 of the strongest lines were considered for these elements compiled from the kurucz atomic line list and national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) line list database .",
    "based on the line identifications done here , and lines in novae spectra known from earlier studies ( williams , 2012 ; das et al .",
    "2008 ) , the observed line list is given in the table  [ table_linelist ] .",
