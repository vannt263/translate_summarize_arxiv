    "in the last decades , several experiments using solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos have provided unambiguous evidence for neutrino mixing .",
    "strong indications in favour of the hypothesis of @xmath4 oscillations in the atmospheric sector have been obtained by @xcite and have been more recently confirmed by @xcite .",
    "however , the direct observation of the _ appearance _ of oscillated @xmath5 s in the atmospheric @xmath6 signal region of the parameter space is still an open issue .",
    "the opera experiment @xcite has been designed to achieve this goal using the _ cern to gran sasso _",
    "@xmath7 beam ( cngs @xcite ) over a baseline of @xmath8 .    based on the emulsion cloud chamber technique @xcite , nuclear emulsions @xcite are used as sub - micrometric space resolution trackers to detect the @xmath9 leptons produced in @xmath5 charged current interactions in a massive ( @xmath10 ) lead target .",
    "the basic target unit ( _ brick _ ) with size @xmath11 consists of @xmath12 nuclear emulsion films , made of two @xmath13-thick layers on either side of a @xmath14 plastic base , interleaved with @xmath15 lead plates of @xmath16 thickness .",
    "bricks are arranged in vertical structures called _",
    "electronic trackers , made of planes of plastic scintillator strips inserted in between the target walls , and muon spectrometers accomplish the task of identifying in real - time the position of the neutrino interaction inside the target . as a result of the combined analysis of electronic data ,",
    "a 3-d brick probability map is computed for each single event and the brick with the highest probability is promptly removed from the target during the run .",
    "the so - called _ changeable sheets _ ( cs ) , pairs of emulsion films placed in front of each brick and acting as interfaces with the electronic trackers , allow the brick identification signal to be checked . only in case of confirmation",
    ", the emulsion films of the brick are developed and sent to the scanning laboratories for interaction vertex location and further analysis .",
    "assuming the nominal intensity of the cngs beam ( @xmath17 p.o.t .",
    "/ year ) , about @xmath18 bricks per day will be extracted from the target , corresponding to a total surface of nuclear emulsions to be scanned of a few thousands @xmath19 per day ) will allow to reduce the area to be scanned to @xmath20 for cc interactions with penetrating muon tracks .",
    "for nc events , we foresee to scan the whole surface . ] in order to analyze the events in _ quasi _ real - time with a reasonable number of microscopes , the use of fast automatic systems with a scanning speed of about @xmath21 is required",
    ".    moreover , the detection of the short - lived @xmath9 leptons through the observation of their _ kink _ decay topology , namely an abrupt deviation of the @xmath9 particle trajectory at the decay point in electron , muon and charged hadron(s ) , occurring over distances of @xmath22 at cngs energy , demands adequate position ( @xmath23 ) and angular ( @xmath24 ) resolutions .",
    "european scanning system _ ( ess ) was designed to meet these experimental requirements .",
    "the general structure of the system and the algorithms developed for image processing and particle tracking in single emulsion films , as well as the hardware and its performance , have been already described in detail @xcite .",
    "the performance in electron - pion separation has been recently published in @xcite .    in this paper , after a brief summary of the main features of the ess , the film - by - film alignment algorithm , relevant for the analysis of opera bricks , and the tracking performance of the system are presented . the methods to be applied for the location of neutrino events",
    "are then described and the results of a beam exposure to high - energy pions , designed to test the above procedures , are reported .",
    "the ess microscope , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ess ] , consists of    * computer driven horizontal and vertical stages equipped with high - speed precision mechanics ; * customized optics providing achromatic planar images of the emulsion ; * high resolution and high frame - rate camera interfaced with a programmable frame - grabber and vision processor .    by adjusting the focal plane of the objective lens through the whole emulsion thickness",
    ", a sequence of tomographic images of each field of view are taken at equally spaced depth levels , processed and analysed in order to recognise aligned clusters of dark pixels ( _ grains _ ) produced by charged particles along their trajectories .",
    "each @xmath13-thick opera emulsion layer is spanned by 15 tomographic images in steps of @xmath25 , accounting for the effective focal depth of the system .    _",
    "micro - tracks _ are reconstructed as geometrical alignments of grains detected in different levels within the same layer . by connecting micro - tracks across the plastic support ,",
    "the so - called _ base - tracks _ are formed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : basetrack_scheme ] ) .",
    "this strongly reduces the instrumental background due to fake combinatorial alignments , thus significantly improving the signal to noise ratio , and increases the precision of track angle reconstruction by minimising distortion effects .",
    "the reconstruction of particle tracks in opera bricks requires connecting base - tracks in several consecutive films .",
    "in order to define a global reference system ( hereafter referred to as _ brick _ reference system ) , prior to track reconstruction a set affine transformations ( shift , rotation and expansion ) relating track coordinates in consecutive films have to be computed to account for relative misalignments and deformations .",
    "the mechanical accuracy of film piling in brick assembly is indeed of @xmath26 , much worse than the achievable precision .",
    "furthermore , emulsion films are affected by environmental conditions ( temperature and humidity ) altering their original geometry .",
    "the task of film alignment is accomplished by exposing each brick to a controlled flux of cosmic rays before disassembly , as described in @xcite , and by applying the following procedure film by film .",
    "starting from a set of independent measurements in single emulsion films , an aligned volume is created through an iterative pattern matching procedure computing the parameters of the transformations    @xmath27    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 are single film track coordinates and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the corresponding _ aligned _ ones .",
    "a least square fit is applied after maximising the number of matching pairs within predefined position and slope tolerances measured in three zones , typically chosen at the corners of the scanned area in order to maximise the lever arm and thus disentangle the contributions due to rotation and translation .",
    "moreover , a wide angular spectrum of collected tracks allows the total thickness of the emulsions and of the interleaved lead plates to be precisely computed , accounting for possible a - planarities .",
    "the difference between the real position of a given track in the _ i - th _ film and the extrapolated position from the _ j - th _ film depends indeed on the uncertainty @xmath32 on the knowledge of the thickness and is a linear function of the track angle . by using a set of tracks crossing the brick at different inclination angles ,",
    "a fit can be performed and the correction to be applied to the nominal value of the z coordinate , perpendicular to the emulsion plane , can be estimated , thus improving the quality of the alignment .    by applying the above procedure to each pair of consecutive films , relative displacements can be reduced to the level of a few @xmath33 , adequate for film - by - film track following ( see section 5 ) , down to less than @xmath34 , as required by local - scale ( @xmath22 ) analysis ( this subject will be discussed in forthcoming papers ) .",
    "the achievable precision mainly depends on the number of penetrating tracks , proportional to the area of the measured zones .",
    "the density of passing - through tracks should be low enough in order not to spoil the topological and kinematical reconstruction of neutrino events ; on the other hand , the scanning time is a critical issue and needs to be minimised .",
    "typically , a density of the order of a few tracks @xmath35 and scanning zones of @xmath36 are a reasonable compromise between these two conflicting requirements .",
    "once all films have been aligned , base - tracks are connected to form _",
    "volume tracks_. a two - step algorithm is applied @xcite .",
    "the first step consists of identifying incremental _",
    "chains _ of consecutive base - tracks .",
    "these chains are then used as input for the kalman filter algorithm @xcite , performing track fitting and propagation with a maximum number of allowed consecutive _ holes _",
    "( i.e. missing segments ) accounting for tracking inefficiency .",
    "in order to study the track reconstruction performance of the ess in terms of resolution and efficiency , a test exposure was performed at the cern ps in the t7 experimental area .",
    "one brick consisting of @xmath37 emulsion films with no lead plates in between was exposed to @xmath38 negatively - charged pions .",
    "the choice of high beam momentum and the use of emulsions only were motivated by the need to minimise the effect of multiple coulomb scattering that would spoil the measurement of the intrinsic resolution .    the emulsion films , produced by the fuji film company , were similar to those used for the experiment , although they were not part of the official opera production .",
    "they were transported by plane from japan to cern where the _ refreshing _ procedure was applied shortly before exposure .",
    "+ nuclear emulsions are continuously sensitive to charged particles from production time until development . as a consequence",
    ", they normally accumulate a significant amount of background due to cosmic rays and ambient radioactivity that can not be distinguished from particle tracks originating from the beam . for this reason ,",
    "a process of controlled fading of the emulsions , called _ refreshing _ , consisting in the destruction of latent image centers in silver bromide crystals by keeping the films at high temperature and high relative humidity for a few days , was implemented for the opera experiment @xcite .",
    "the working conditions can be tuned in order to reduce the average number of grains per base - track below the applied threshold , while preserving the emulsion sensitivity .",
    "this implies the _ cancellation _ of recorded tracks",
    ". the achieved track erasing efficiency can be higher than @xmath39 .",
    "the angular dependence of the ess tracking efficiency and precision were studied by rotating the brick with respect to the beam direction in 7 different positions from @xmath40 ( tracks perpendicular to the films ) to @xmath41 .",
    "the pion beam and the exposure time were adjusted so as to produce a density in emulsion of about @xmath42 tracks @xmath35 for each angle .",
    "reference emulsions not exposed to the pion beam were also developed to provide an evaluation of the instrumental background , mainly due to uncorrelated grains randomly produced in the development process ( _ fog _ ) that tend to hide real track grains , hence resulting in fake coincidences .    in order to collect a sample of several hundred tracks per angle exposure , an area of a few @xmath19 was scanned for each film and a pattern - matching procedure",
    "was applied to compute the parameters of film inter - calibration transformations , as described in section 3 .",
    "measured base - tracks were then connected to form volume tracks .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we foresee to complete the scanning of each brick in a few hours . in order to minimise the scanning time required for event location ,",
    "fine corrections are not applied in scan - back mode .",
    "first of all , only a _ global _",
    "film inter - calibration procedure is performed .",
    "[ fig : sb_posdiff_found_pred ] shows the distribution of the position differences between predicted and found base - track segments .",
    "the plot refers to tracks scattered over an area of about @xmath43 .",
    "the sigma of the gaussian fit is of about @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , only one microscope view is measured for each predicted track , thus effects such as local planarity can not be corrected .",
    "the resulting angular precision is of about @xmath45 .",
    "the scan - back reproducibility was studied by performing the procedure twice for the same set of predictions and by comparing film by film the selected base - tracks per each predicted track .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reproduce ] , the reproducibility is of about @xmath46 in position and @xmath47 in angle .    as a cross - check for the validation of scan - back results ,",
    "the volume scan procedure was applied around track disappearance points and , by a combined analysis of scan - back and volume scan data , events were classified as single and multi - prong interactions , low energy ( scattering ) tracks and passing - through tracks .",
    "film - dependent effects , such as local distortion and misalignments resulting from large rotations , not completely corrected in the inter - calibration procedure , were found to be the main sources of inefficiency ( @xmath48 ) in the track following .",
    "such effects can be accounted for by enlarging the search window in case no base - tracks compatible with a given prediction are found and by implementing a _ prediction - forking _ method , allowing for multiple candidate following , if the slope / position acceptances are increased .",
    "failures of the system in passing - through track following can be thus reduced to @xmath49 .",
    "the particle tracking performance of the european scanning system ( ess ) , a novel high - speed automatic microscope for the measurement of nuclear emulsion films , has been presented .",
    "the system , developed for the location and analysis of neutrino interactions in the emulsion - lead target of the opera experiment , fully satisfies the requirements of high tracking efficiency and accuracy , working at a speed of @xmath50 .",
    "the results of a test exposure to high - energy pions , designed to study the methods to be applied for film - by - film alignment , track following and event location and confirmation , were discussed in details , showing that the system is able to track particles produced in beam interactions with lead through the whole brick and identify the vertex points where they originate .",
    "the achieved results make us confident in view of forthcoming cngs neutrino runs .",
