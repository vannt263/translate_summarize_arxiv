    "( [ smith variables ] ) , respectively . now , recall that @xmath313 is a matrix of integers , and , therefore @xmath314 is a vector of integers for every @xmath315 .",
    "since the smith variables @xmath288 are independent and take all possible integer values , by choosing @xmath316 , the relation @xmath317 implies that the first column of @xmath318 must have integer entries . by the same argument",

    "ideally , one would like to have @xmath345 , however , near the boundary of the polytope @xmath346 some sides are missing , giving rise to loss of regularity , as already mentioned .",
    "we argue here that the thickness of the defective region does not scale with @xmath19 .",
    "this ensures that in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath19 , e.g. , the sums over @xmath259  can always be safely approximated by integrals over  @xmath346 , even when the probability distribution @xmath38 is flat , as required to obtain eq .",
    "( [ low p fide ] ) .",
    "the thickness of the defective region depends solely on the intrinsic properties of the hamiltonian @xmath94 , including the number of rationally independent energy units , through the matrix  @xmath140 . to simplify the argument",
    "let us assume that @xmath259 is a cubic lattice with unit spacing .",
    "it has been shown above that this assumption does not entail any loss of generality , as it just requires choosing energy units as in  ( [ epsilon^s ] ) .",
    "let  @xmath347 stand for the row @xmath113 of the matrix  @xmath140 .",
    "then , for each @xmath348 , @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the @xmath113-th component of @xmath351 , defines a discrete family of hyperplanes that are orthogonal to  @xmath352 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath353 can always be spanned by a set @xmath354 of independent vectors of @xmath355 that are orthogonal to @xmath356 .",

    "we note that @xmath354 define a lattice within @xmath358 and any @xmath359-dimensional ball or radius @xmath357 ( or larger ) contains at least one site of it .",
    "a site @xmath351 belongs to @xmath187 iff there is at least one site @xmath235 that satisfies  ( [ defect1 ] ) for all @xmath113 .",
    "the smith normal form and bezout lemma ( see previous subsection ) ensure that there are infinitely many vectors  @xmath360 in @xmath361 satisfying  ( [ defect1 ] ) for a given @xmath362 ( but they are not necessarily in  @xmath187 ) .",

    "this concludes our proof .    by the same argument , since the volume of the intersection of @xmath371 with the hyperplanes  ( [ defect1 ] ) grows with  @xmath2 ( but at a fixed distance from the boundary )",
    ", the number of balls or radius @xmath357 it will eventually contain grows as  @xmath134 and so does the number of point in @xmath358 , i.e. , the numbers of points in @xmath372 associated to a given @xmath373 , as required to obtain , e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ pmm ] ) .    as a final remark ,",
    "we note also that the pattern of defects near the boundary of @xmath374 is exactly the same for every @xmath19 , provided that @xmath19 is sufficiently large .",
    "the reason is that all the lattices @xmath29 are similar ( i.e. , have the same shape but different size ) .",
    "hence , the regions of them that are at a fixed distance from the boundary are identical and , as argued above , these regions determine the pattern of defects of @xmath187 .      in this section",
    "we show that the pm fidelity attains the upper bound  ( [ upper bound ] ) to the cloning fidelity , and thus prove the equivalence between pm and macroscopic cloning of quantum clocks .",
    "the proof uses the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath128 and @xmath127 , as well as the fact that the probability distribution @xmath375 approaches a multivariate gaussian distribution as @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "the former , enables us to write eq .",

    "<S> , nothing is known in the probabilistic case , where the tradeoff between performance and probability of success adds a new twist to the problem . here </S>",
    "<S> , proving the equivalence requires showing that for every cloning machine there is a protocol based on state estimation that , in the macroscopic limit , achieves the same fidelity with the same probability . but is the enhanced precision of pm sufficient to keep up with the highly - increased performance of probabilistic cloning machines ?    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we answer the question in the affirmative , showing that postselection does not challenge the fundamental equivalence between cloning and estimation . </S>",
    "<S> we first work out explicitly the example of quantum clocks , where the performance enhancements are the most prominent . </S>",
    "<S> we consider clock states @xmath6 generated from an arbitrary input state  @xmath7 by time evolution with arbitrary hamiltonian acting on a @xmath8-dimensional hilbert space @xmath9 and we exhibit pm protocols that achieve the performances of the optimal cloning machine for every desired value of the success probability . in this comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we use the most restrictive criterion , namely the global fidelity between the clones and  @xmath2 perfectly synchronized replicas of the original clock . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the fidelity explicitly and discover that its value depends critically on the number of rationally independent eigenvalues of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the result is derived using new techniques , based on the smith normal form @xcite , which we expect to be useful for other problems in quantum metrology and optimal quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we analyze the scenario where the performances of cloning are judged from groups of  @xmath10 clones , establishing the equivalence between probabilistic cloning and estimation for arbitrary sets of input states and for arbitrary values of the success probability . </S>",
    "<S> this result extends the validity of equivalence to all points of the optimal performance - probability tradeoff .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start from the concrete example of quantum clocks . with a suitable choice of basis , </S>",
    "<S> the state of a clock at time @xmath11 can be written as  @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the probability that a measurement of energy gives outcome  @xmath15 . without loss of generality , we assume that all probabilities @xmath16 are non - zero , that the eigenvalues @xmath17 are distinct , and that  @xmath18 . in the case of @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> identical synchronized clocks , we denote the state at time @xmath20 as @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the total energy can be labeled by the partitions of @xmath19 into @xmath8 non - negative integers @xmath22 . denoting by @xmath23 [ @xmath24 the 1  column integer ( 1  row real ) matrix @xmath25 [ @xmath26 we express the corresponding energy as  @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the total hamiltonian will be denoted by  @xmath28 , where@xmath29 is the lattice of vectors  @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 for every  @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    by collecting the vectors that lead to the same energy  @xmath34 , we define the set @xmath35 , so that  @xmath36 is the degeneracy of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the state of the  @xmath19 clocks can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the multinomial distribution @xmath39 and @xmath40    in the metrology scenario , the goal is to estimate the time @xmath20 as accurately as possible . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate , denoted by @xmath41 , can be used to produce @xmath2 approximate clones , by preparing a state  @xmath42 , so that , averaging over all possible values of @xmath41 , the output state resembles  @xmath43 . as a performance measure </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt the worst - case fidelity @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the probability of estimating @xmath41 when the true value is @xmath20 . for covariant families of states , such as the quantum clocks under consideration , </S>",
    "<S> the worst - case fidelity is equal to the average of the fidelity with respect to the uniform prior . in the case of pm </S>",
    "<S> the estimation strategy does not provide an estimate all the times , but sometimes declares  failure \" , in which case one abstains from producing copies . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath46 has to be understood as @xmath47 , the probability of estimating @xmath41 conditional to the fact that the strategy succeeded in producing an estimate . to take this into account </S>",
    "<S> , one can equivalently replace the input state @xmath48 by a state the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is suitable operator satisfying @xmath51 . by the symmetry of the figure of merit in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ figure ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath50 can be chosen to be diagonal in the energy basis , namely @xmath52 . with this choice the probability of success is independent of @xmath20 and is given by @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> fixing the coefficients of the guess state and of the filter , we show that the supremum of the fidelity over all quantum measurements is @xcite @xmath54 where the outer sum runs over the set @xmath55 and the prime  ( @xmath56 ) means that the sum is restricted to those @xmath57 such that @xmath58 . for a fixed filter @xmath59 , </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath60 the supremum of the fidelity in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f_m&p ] ) over all possible guess states . </S>",
    "<S> the question now is whether , suitably choosing the filter @xmath59 , the value of @xmath61 can reach the fidelity of the optimal quantum copy machine in the macroscopic limit  @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us examine now the cloning scenario . </S>",
    "<S> here , one can produce copies coherently using a general quantum operation ( completely positive trace non - increasing map ) @xmath63 that maps states on @xmath64 to states on @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum operation @xmath66 can always be written as a composition of a probabilistic filter  @xmath59 followed by a trace preserving map  @xmath67 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again , the symmetry of the figure of merit allows one to choose without loss of generality a filter of the form @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> our first step is to upper bound the maximum fidelity achievable for a fixed filter , denoted by @xmath69 , as @xcite @xmath70 the next step is to show that the fidelity @xmath61 achieves the upper bound in the limit of large @xmath2 . for the sake of illustration , we start from the simple case where all the energies @xmath17 are commensurable , i.e. ,  @xmath71 where  @xmath72 is an integer and @xmath73 is a fixed unit of energy . </S>",
    "<S> then , the energy eigenvalues for @xmath2 clocks can be written as @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently large @xmath2 , it is easy to see that the minimum spacing between two consecutive energies is given by @xmath75 , with @xmath76 denoting the greatest common divisor </S>",
    "<S> . this fact is an immediate consequence of bezout s identity in number theory  @xcite . now , suppose that @xmath2 is asymptotically large . in this limit , the multinomial distribution @xmath77 approaches the multivariate normal distribution  @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and the covariance matrix @xmath80 has entries @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , this implies that the probability distribution @xmath84 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ clock states ] ) is concentrated in a window of size  @xmath85 centred around the mean value  @xmath86 . within this window , </S>",
    "<S> every two consecutive energies differ by the minimum amount @xmath87  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , note that by dimensional arguments the degeneracy of a typical energy grows as  @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sum over @xmath89 that defines @xmath84 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ clock states ] ) can be approximated by the integral of  @xmath90 over a @xmath91-dimensional domain . as a result </S>",
    "<S> ,  @xmath84 is approximated by the discrete gaussian distribution @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the variance of @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p^m_e ] ) we are now in position to show that @xmath61 approaches @xmath95 in the macroscopic limit . indeed , since for @xmath96 the probability @xmath97 is almost constant over every interval of size @xmath3 , we can pull out a factor  @xmath98 from both sums in  eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f_m&p ] ) introducing an error that vanishes in the asymptotic limit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can choose a guess state with probabilities  @xmath99 given by a discrete gaussian with width growing as  @xmath100 ,  @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> since the width is much larger than @xmath3 , we have for every @xmath102 and we can pull out the term @xmath103 from the sum over  @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> since the width is much smaller than @xmath105 , we have  @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our choice of guess state attains the upper bound in  eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ upper bound ] ) and we have @xcite @xmath107 the reader should not be misled by the simplicity of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p^m_e ] ) , which superficially may seem an application of the central limit theorem ( clt ) . </S>",
    "<S> the clt gives an approximation of the _ cumulative _ distribution of @xmath84 , not of the probability mass itself . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , those who believe that @xmath84 should converge to a gaussian are in for a surprise in the case where the eigenvalues of @xmath94 are not commensurable . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the eigenvalues  @xmath17 can be expressed as integer linear combinations of a minimal number  @xmath108 of rationally independent units of energy  @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> rational independence means that , for every set of integer coefficients @xmath110 , the relation @xmath111 implies  @xmath112 for every @xmath113 . in terms of the units </S>",
    "<S> @xmath114 , we expand each eigenvalue as  @xmath115 where @xmath116 are integer coefficients , uniquely defined thanks to the rational independence of the units . using the decomposition , </S>",
    "<S> we express the energy of @xmath2 clocks as @xmath117 where @xmath118 , and @xmath119 is the 1  column matrix with components @xmath120 , or , more compactly , @xmath121 where  @xmath122 is the @xmath123 matrix with entries  @xmath124 . the matrix @xmath122 maps the lattice @xmath125 into a new lattice @xmath126 with the special feature that the points in  @xmath127 are into one - to - one correspondence with the energies in @xmath128 ( again , due to the rational independence of the units ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , instead of the probability distribution @xmath84 we can consider the probability distribution @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> now , for large @xmath2 this probability distribution is concentrated in a volume of size  @xmath130 centred around the mean @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> the typical vectors @xmath132 associated to points in this volume form a regular bravais lattice and the number of vectors associated to a point @xmath133 grows as @xmath134 @xcite . by the same arguments as in the paragraph after eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ upper bound ] ) , we can approximate the sum in the expression of @xmath135 with an integral , thus obtaining @xcite @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the volume of a minimal cell of the lattice @xmath127 . using the smith normal form of @xmath140 </S>",
    "<S> one can show that @xmath141_r\\ } $ ] , where @xmath142_r\\}$ ] is the set of all minors of @xmath122 of order  @xmath108  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pmm ] ) has two major consequences : first , the probability mass @xmath84 _ does not converge to a gaussian _ , as one would naively expect from a misapplication of the  clt . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it converges to the non - continuous function @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the value of @xmath145 such that @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> second , all the steps of the proof for commensurable energies can now be reproduced by replacing the energy @xmath57 with the corresponding vector @xmath147 . in this way we obtain @xmath148 , with @xmath149 note that , since @xmath150 scales as @xmath2 , the fidelity scales as @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the asymptotic behaviour depends dramatically on the number of rationally independent units . </S>",
    "<S> quite remarkably , this means that the fidelity is not continuos in the hamiltonian : although one can approximate arbitrarily well the hamiltonian @xmath94 with another hamiltonian @xmath152 that has commensurable energies , the corresponding fidelities are not going to be close . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the discontinuity is that the value of the fidelity depends on the _ closure _ of the set of clock states , due to the infimum in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ figure ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the energy eigenvalues are commensurable , the time evolution is periodic and the orbit @xmath153 is a close one - dimensional curve . </S>",
    "<S> but when the energies are combinations of @xmath108 rationally independent units , the orbit is dense in an @xmath108-dimensional submanifold of the manifold of pure states . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is the quantum analog of a classic feature of integrable hamiltonian systems @xcite , where rationally independent frequencies lead to ergodic time evolutions in phase space . here </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity is discontinuous because it depends on the long - time behaviour of the time evolution , during which the quantum clock can probe a higher dimensional manifold . </S>",
    "<S> note that for finite times the differences between both families of clock - states generated by @xmath94 and @xmath152 can be arbitrary small and that continuity is retrieved if we restrict the infimum in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ figure ] ) to a fixed time interval @xmath154 $ ] .    having proven the asymptotic equivalence between probabilistic metrology and cloning of quantum clocks , we now give closed expressions for optimal fidelity , maximized over all possible filters . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the large @xmath19 limit under the condition @xmath155 and consider two relevant regimes : first , we allow arbitrarily low probability of success , showing that the ultimate fidelity is @xcite @xmath156^{-1/2 } \\ ! </S>",

    "<S> since @xmath157 scales as @xmath159 , the fidelity scales as @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> second , we consider the case where the probability of success is high , i.e. @xmath161 for some small @xmath162 . here </S>",
    "<S> the optimal fidelity acquires the particularly simple form @xmath163+o(\\eta^2 ) \\ , .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{high p fide}\\ ] ] quite surprisingly , @xmath164 does not depend on the coefficients  @xmath16 of the input state , but only on the number of rationally independent units @xmath108 .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by discussing the equivalence between probabilistic metrology and cloning for arbitrary sets of states . here </S>",
    "<S> we assess the performance of cloning by looking at a random subset of @xmath165 clones , evaluating the global fidelity between the state of the @xmath166 clones and the state of @xmath166 ideal copies . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , since the @xmath166 clones are picked at random , one can assume that the optimal cloner is invariant under permutation of the @xmath2 output systems . </S>",
    "<S> technically , this means that the cloner is described by a quantum operation @xmath66 such that , for every permutation @xmath167 , one has @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the permutation map defined by @xmath170 . using a de finetti - type argument </S>",
    "<S> , we prove the following result @xcite :    [ theo : one ] for every quantum operation @xmath171 with input in @xmath172 and permutationally invariant output in @xmath173 there exists a pm protocol , described by a quantum operation @xmath174 , such that _ i ) _ @xmath171 and @xmath175 have the same success probability and _ ii ) _ the error probability in distinguishing between @xmath171 and  @xmath176 by inputting a state @xmath177 and measuring @xmath178 output systems is lower bounded by @xmath179 $ ] , where @xmath180 $ ] .    in the case of cloning </S>",
    "<S> , the result implies that the @xmath166-copy fidelity of an arbitrary @xmath19-to-@xmath2 cloner on a generic input state @xmath181 can be achieved by pm , up to an error of size @xmath182 $ ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the error vanishes as @xmath183 for every process with success probability larger than a given finite value for every possible input . </S>",
    "<S> this result extends the equivalence between cloning and estimation to every point of the tradeoff curve between fidelity and success probability . </S>",
    "<S> the result holds also in the bayesian scenario where the input state @xmath181 is given with prior probability @xmath184 and one considers average fidelities and average success probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the average success probability of the optimal @xmath19-to-@xmath2 cloner is lower bounded by a finite value independent of @xmath2 and therefore the best asymptotic cloner can be simulated by pm @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we proved that probabilistic protocols empowered by postselection do not challenge the fundamental equivalence between cloning and estimation . </S>",
    "<S> we worked out explicitly the case of quantum clocks , where the performance enhancements for both tasks are most dramatic , and developed a technique to evaluate the optimal asymptotic fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> we found out that the asymptotic fidelity depends critically on the number of rationally independent units generating the spectrum of the hamiltonian , due to an effect that is analog to ergodicity of classical dynamical systems . </S>",
