    "as always in astronomy , the determination of distances is a crucial and difficult problem . until recently , the distance scale of grbs was unknown by over 12 orders - of - magnitude . in 1997",
    ", the discovery of optical and radio counterparts @xcite proved that at least the long - duration bursters were at cosmological distances with redshifts of @xmath3 .",
    "the measurement of grb redshifts requires deep optical spectra , and to date only 24 redshifts are known for bursts with unknown selection effects .    if grb distance indicators can be found that use only gamma - ray data ,",
    "then we can measure the demographics and cosmology of large and well - understood samples of bursts .",
    "two such luminosity ( and hence distance ) indicators have recently been proposed .",
    "the first @xcite relates the burst luminosity ( @xmath4 ) with the spectral lag ( @xmath5 ) , which can be idealized as the time between peaks as recorded at high and low photon energies .",
    "the second @xcite relates the luminosity with the variability ( @xmath6 ) , which is a specific measure of the spikiness of the burst light curve .",
    "high luminosity bursts have short lags and spiky light curves , while low luminosity events have long lags and smooth light curves .",
    "these two relations make grbs into standard candles , in the same sense as for cepheids and supernovae where an observed light curve property can yield the luminosity and then the distance .    the two luminosity indicators were originally proposed and calibrated with 6 or 7 bursts .",
    "the addition of 3 or 2 further bursts ( for a total of nine ) have fallen on the original relations , hence adding confidence in their utility .",
    "further , if both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 relations are true , then there must be a particular @xmath9 relation , and this prediction has been strongly confirmed with an independent sample of 112 batse bursts @xcite .",
    "finally , the very long lag bursts have been shown to be very low luminosity as demonstrated by their concentration to the local supergalactic plane @xcite .",
    "these luminosity indicators have been used to identify specific bursts @xcite that are at redshifts of @xmath10 as well as to show that the star formation rate of the universe is rising steadily @xcite from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "this _ letter _",
    "reports on the construction of a hubble diagram ( a plot of luminosity distance , @xmath13 , versus redshift ) as a means of measuring the expansion history of our universe .",
    "only nine grbs have the required information of red shift ( @xmath14 ) , peak flux ( @xmath15 ) , lag time ( @xmath5 ) , and variability ( @xmath6 ) . these data are collected in table 1 , along with the characteristic photon energy ( @xmath16 ) and the observed luminosity ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these nine bursts were all detected by batse with redshifts measured from optical spectra of either the afterglow or the host galaxy .",
    "the highly unusual grb980425 ( associated with supernova sn1998bw ) is not included because it is likely to be qualitatively different from the classical grbs .",
    "bursts with red shifts that were not recorded by batse can not ( yet ) have their observed parameters converted to energies and fluxes that are comparable with batse data .",
    "simplistically , plots of @xmath17 versus @xmath5 and @xmath17 versus @xmath6 can calibrate the luminosity indicators , which then can yield luminosity distances to each burst for plotting on a hubble diagram and fitting to cosmological models . in practice",
    ", there must be a simultaneous chi - square minimization for the luminosity calibrations and the cosmology , so as to avoid the effects of possible correlations between the indicators and distance .",
    "if the earth is not along the central axis of the grb s jet , then various off - axis effects will change the observed properties .",
    "for light viewed off - axis by angle @xmath18 from a jet moving at @xmath19 times the speed of light , the transverse doppler shift , redshift , and beaming will change the various observed properties by powers of @xmath20 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath16 will scale as @xmath21 , @xmath5 will scale as @xmath22 , @xmath6 will scale as the inverse of a time and hence as @xmath21 , while @xmath4 will have a model dependent variation that scales roughly as @xmath23 . for structured jets @xcite",
    ", the luminosity and bulk lorentz factor can be parameterized as being proportional to some positive power of @xmath21 . when viewed on - axis",
    ", the bursts will presumably display fairly tight lag / luminosity and variability / luminosity relations .",
    "these relations can be converted to similar relations involving observed off - axis quantities with an extra factor of @xmath21 to some power .",
    "fortunately , the observed distribution of @xmath16 is remarkably narrow for bursts of a given brightness @xcite , and the removal of kinematic effects shows that the on - axis @xmath16 is virtually constant @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath16 should be proportional only to some power of @xmath21 , and this relation can be used to convert the @xmath21 dependency of the luminosity relations into a @xmath16 dependency .",
    "essentially , we can use the observed @xmath16 value to get information about the off - axis angle and correct the observed @xmath5 and @xmath6 values to those which would be seen on - axis . in practice",
    ", the correction factor can be taken as some power of @xmath24 .",
    "( the division by 400 kev is to minimize correlations between the normalization constant and the exponent during the fits . )",
    "the exponents of the correction factors will be free parameters which depend on the scenario and jet structure .    with the off - axis correction",
    ", the luminosities can be derived by fitting the relations @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 ^{e_{lag}}$ ] and @xmath28 ^{e_v}$ ] .",
    "plots of @xmath17 versus @xmath29 and @xmath17 versus @xmath30 for the nine bursts with known redshifts ( see figure 1 ) have slopes of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , while the scatter in these plots will be minimized for the best values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this gives @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "thus : @xmath39^{-1.27 } , \\ ] ] @xmath40^{1.57 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath4 is in @xmath41 , @xmath5 is in seconds , @xmath6 is dimensionless , and @xmath16 is in kev . as independent checks , a plot of @xmath29 versus @xmath30 for 93 batse bursts will have a slope of @xmath42 , and the scatter will be minimized for the best values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this gives @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ; values which are consistent with the calibration from figure 1 .",
    "the lag and the variability produce two independent luminosity values through eqs 1 and 2 .",
    "these can be combined as weighted averages ( with the weights equal to the inverse square of the one - sigma errors ) to produce a combined luminosity ( @xmath46 ) and then @xmath13 , as given in table 1 . a plot of @xmath13 versus @xmath14 is a hubble diagram ( figure 2 ) .",
    "equations 1 and 2 are optimal for studies of grbs where the cosmology is not in question . when the goal is to use the bursts as cosmological markers , care must be taken to avoid circular logic .",
    "in particular , the previous paragraph assumed a specific cosmology ( @xmath47 for a flat universe and @xmath48 ) for calculating the @xmath13 values as a function of @xmath14 . to avoid this circularity ,",
    "the fits must be performed with the cosmological parameters as additional fit parameters .",
    "that is , the model being fit to the data will have cosmological plus grb parameters that are to be simultaneously determined by the minimization of the chi - square .",
    "this will tie the cosmology conclusions into grb calibrations , but both will be well constrained when many bursts are available . a correct procedure to find the best value of @xmath49 in a flat universe is ( 1 ) to fix @xmath49 , ( 2 ) derive @xmath13 and @xmath17 for each burst for that cosmology , ( 3 ) fit @xmath17 as power laws of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , ( 4 ) use the best fits to derive @xmath46 and then @xmath13 for each burst , ( 5 ) calculate chi - square by comparing the model and observed @xmath13 values , ( 6 ) repeat steps 1 - 5 to identify the best fit @xmath49 value as that where chi - square is minimized , and ( 7 ) identify the one - sigma range where chi - square is within unity of its minimum value . by this procedure",
    ", the lowest chi - square corresponds to @xmath50 with the one - sigma constraint @xmath51 .",
    "the three - sigma limit is larger than unity , so this particular measure is not helpful for cosmology .",
    "this new result is completely independent of , yet in agreement with , those from supernovae and other methods @xcite .",
    "however , the current value for @xmath49 is not yet of high reliability because the number of degree of freedom in the fit are small and the slope of the hubble diagram is dominated by just two high redshift events .",
    "while this new result does not seriously constrain current cosmology , it does act as a demonstration of principle and a sign for the future .",
    "a comparison with the supernova - based hubble diagram is inevitable .",
    "grbs have both advantages and disadvantages when compared to supernovae .",
    "at least currently , supernovae have an advantage over grbs for the accuracy of the distance measurements for a single event .",
    "well - observed nearby type ia supernovae have an rms scatter about their hubble diagram of 0.18 mag @xcite which translates into an uncertainty in the log of the distance of 0.04 .",
    "grbs currently have an rms scatter about their calibration curves of 0.35 and 0.20 in the logs of lag and variability ; which translates into uncertainties in the log of the distance of 0.22 and 0.16 respectively .",
    "these two independent measures can be combined to give an uncertainty of 0.13 in the log of the distance .",
    "thus , individual supernovae are roughly three times more accurate as standard candles than are individual grbs .",
    "the physics of gamma - ray emission from relativistic shocks in grbs is largely known ( but not how to create the magnetic fields ) although the explosion scenario is still uncertain . the basic physics of supernovae is well known ( although the type ia progenitors are still not identified ) .",
    "supernovae can have their decline - rate versus luminosity calibration from low - redshift events , and this allows the elegance of being able to make the calibration substantially separate from the cosmology .",
    "thus , supernovae are much better understood than are grbs , and this will be a substantial comfort for using them as standard candles .",
    "nevertheless , it is unclear where this advantage for supernovae will pay off .",
    "currently , the analyses of both supernova and grb hubble diagrams are entirely empirical with no contribution from theory , so a better theoretical understanding of supernovae has not helped in any specific manner .",
    "supernova will have better known evolution effects ; yet @xcite show that evolution is no problem for supernovae and their argument applies identically to grbs .",
    "supernovae have substantial problems with a higher dust density at high red shift @xcite and the possibility of grey dust @xcite .",
    "gamma radiation suffers from no extinction .    after a tremendous observational effort",
    ", the current supernova hubble diagram @xcite extends only out to @xmath52 .",
    "( sn1997ff at @xmath53 has very large uncertainties @xcite even without the large corrections for gravitational lensing @xcite and the uncertainty of the supernova type . )",
    "the dedicated snap satellite @xcite , proposed for launch in 2008 , will go out to @xmath54 with exquisite accuracy in the light curves .",
    "in contrast , the grb hubble diagram is already out to @xmath0 and likely it will be extended to @xmath1 @xcite or farther @xcite . with the launch of the swift satellite in 2003 , the grb hubble diagram will be available for the redshift ranges @xmath55 and @xmath56 roughly five years before snap can extend the supernova hubble diagram only to @xmath55 .    in summary",
    ", grbs are @xmath57 worse in accuracy than supernovae , but this is traded - off for the lack of problems from extinction , extension to @xmath10 , and an answer many years before snap .",
    "i do not think that the grb hubble diagram will replace the supernova hubble diagram .",
    "the reason is that _ both _ diagrams will have known and unknown systematic problems which will make results from any _ one _ method not conclusive .",
    "what is needed is the concurrence of multiple independent methods .",
    "so _ both _ grb and supernova hubble diagrams are needed for a confident result .",
    "conceptually , the biggest question related to a construction of the grb hubble diagram is the possibility of luminosity evolution .",
    "fortunately , there are two strong reasons that any such effects must be small .",
    "first , theoretical explanations for the luminosity indicators @xcite tie the relations to simple physics ( involving relativistic effects operating on any light source , the delay in light travelling different paths , and the cooling of any body by radiation ) that are unrelated to properties ( such as metallicity ) that might evolve .",
    "second , just as for the purely empirical supernova hubble diagram @xcite , any drift in population average properties @xcite is irrelevant as the calibrations will work for any individual event whether near or far .",
    "that is , it does not matter whether population average properties ( like luminosity ) evolve because the distances are derived for individual events that are each correctly calibrated .    within two years",
    ", the grb situation will be greatly improved with the dedicated swift satellite @xcite currently scheduled for launch in september 2003 .",
    "swift is expected to get @xmath58 bursts per year , of which @xmath59 will have directly measured redshifts .",
    "the redshift will be difficult to measure for @xmath60 bursts , yet it is possible by locating the lyman break with broad - band photometry or spectroscopy extending into the near infrared . in its nominal three - year lifetime , we can get @xmath2 bursts with measured values for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath16 .",
    "this many bursts will allow for high accuracy calibration of the luminosity indicators .",
    "the large number of bursts will also allow for the reduction of statistical errors ( dominated by the intrinsic scatter of the bursts ) by a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "if the bursts are divided into six redshift bins , each bin will have an error of 0.03 in the log of the distance .",
    "this accuracy will , for example , yield an uncertainty of @xmath62 in the derived value of @xmath49 for a flat universe , even with no improvements in the luminosity indicators .",
    "so with swift , the prospect is that we can produce an accurate grb hubble diagram with @xmath2 bursts from @xmath63 by 2006 .",
    "what can we learn from the grb hubble diagram ?",
    "we can test the predicted shift of the universe from matter to dark - energy domination in the range @xmath64 .",
    "we will also look for various predicted quintessence @xcite and non - standard @xcite effects in the range @xmath65 .",
    "the typical sizes of these effects are 0.4 in the log of the distance around a redshift of @xmath66 . the current paradigm of cosmology ( the new inflation perhaps with quintessence ) is so new and untested that surprises could easily await in the unknown regime of @xmath67 .",
