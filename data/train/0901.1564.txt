    "we investigate the evolution of barred galaxy solving the resistive set of mhd equations .",
    "we apply an isothermal equation of state .",
    "our galaxy is composed of four components : the large and massive halo , the central bulge , rotating disc of stars and finally the bar .",
    "the rotation curve of the stellar disc we deriveded from the isochrone potential .",
    "the bar component is described by the second order ferrers ellipsoid @xcite with semi - axes @xmath0  kpc , @xmath1  kpc , @xmath2  kpc .",
    "it is initiated into the galaxy gradually in time until it reaches its final mass @xmath3 . in order to conserve the total mass of the galaxy we reduce the bulge mass , so we have @xmath4  const . during the calculations .",
    "the bar angular velocity @xmath5 is set to be @xmath6  km  s@xmath7  kpc@xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the initial magnetic field is azimuthal ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and its distribution strictly depends on the gas distribution via the following condition : @xmath11 the computational domain extends from @xmath12  kpc to @xmath13  kpc in the @xmath14  and @xmath15 direction , and from @xmath16  kpc to @xmath17  kpc in the @xmath18 direction . in all models we use the same value of the resistivity coefficient @xmath19  @xmath20s@xmath7 and the resolution @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "we perform simulations of magnetic field evolution with a constant isothermal sound of speed @xmath23  km / s and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 g ) .",
    "below we discuss the time evolution of the distributions of polarization angle and polarized intensity superimposed onto the column density . in order to show the magnetic field behaviour in our model we present three crucial time steps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polar ] ) :    * at time @xmath26  gyr ( fig .  [ fig : polar ] , left ) , as a consequence of the non - axisymmetric gravitational potential of a bar , the gaseous and magnetic arms are formed . in the inner part of the disk , where the bar is presented , we obtain the highest density region and the strongest magnetic field .",
    "moreover the magnetic field maxima are aligned along the gaseous ones .",
    "* as the simulation proceed , magnetic arms start to detach from gaseous spirals into the interarm regions ( see @xmath27  gyr fig .  [",
    "fig : polar ] , in the middle ) .",
    "* at @xmath28  gyr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polar ] , right ) our magnetic arms are also visible in the interam region .",
    "this is because the magnetic arms do not corotate with gaseous spirals but have a slightly lower angular velocity .",
    "the process of drift of magnetic structures into the interarm area have also been obtained by @xcite .",
    "cm at selected times steps superimposed onto gaseous map .",
    "all maps have been smoothed to the resolution @xmath29,title=\"fig : \" ]  cm at selected times steps superimposed onto gaseous map .",
    "all maps have been smoothed to the resolution @xmath29,title=\"fig : \" ]  cm at selected times steps superimposed onto gaseous map .",
    "all maps have been smoothed to the resolution @xmath29,title=\"fig : \" ]    we started our simulations with mean magnetic field equal @xmath30  @xmath31 g . during the whole simulation time we observe the growth of the total magnetic energy",
    "this amplification is caused by a local compression accompanied with leading sides of the bar and inner edges of spiral arms .",
    "as we do not apply the dynamo effect the mean value of the @xmath32 flux in the galactic midplane drops .",
    "* we obtained the magnetic field vectors distributed along the bar , spiral arms and also in the interarm region . *",
    "magnetic arms are developing in the gaseous ones , but are detached from the density waves . in the consequence the magnetic arms are shifted to the interarm regions , what is in agreement with observations ( e.g. ngc 1356 @xcite ) * the magnetic field energy in barred galaxies can be amplified without any dynamo action but only due to non - axisymmetrical velocity ."

    "<S> the model does not take into consideration the dynamo process . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the obtained magnetic field configurations are highly similar to the observed maps of the polarized intensity of barred galaxies , because the modeled vectors form coherent structures along the bar and spiral arms . due to the dynamical influence of the bar the gas forms spiral waves which go radially outward . </S>",
    "<S> each spiral arm forms the magnetic arm which stays much longer in the disk , than the gaseous spiral structure . </S>",
    "<S> additionally the modeled total energy of magnetic field grows due to strong compression and shear of non - axisymmetrical bar flows and differential rotation , respectively . </S>"
