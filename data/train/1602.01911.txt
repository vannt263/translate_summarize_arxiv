    "the multiple - descriptions ( md ) source coding problem arises naturally in a number of applications such as transmission of video , audio and speech over packet networks and fading channels @xcite@xcite .",
    "the multiple - descriptions ( md ) source coding setup describes a communications setting consisting of one encoder and several decoders .",
    "the encoder receives a discrete memoryless source and wishes to compress it into several _",
    "descriptions_. each decoder receives a specific subset of these descriptions through noiseless links , and produces a reconstruction of the source vector with respect to its own distortion criterion .",
    "the parameters of interest are the rates required for transmitting the description and the resulting distortions at the decoders .",
    "the objective is to design communications schemes which result in the optimal asymptotic trade - off between these two groups of parameters .",
    "the problem has been studied extensively @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , however , the optimal asymptotically achievable rate - distortion ( rd ) is not known even for the most elementary case when only two descriptions are considered .",
    "the two - descriptions setup is depicted in figure [ 2desc ] .",
    "evidently , for the individual decoders ( which receive only one description ) to perform optimally the encoder must transmit the two - descriptions according to the optimal point - to - point ( ptp ) source coding schemes .",
    "this may require the two - descriptions to be similar to each other . on the other hand , if the descriptions are similar , one of them would be redundant at the central decoder ( which receive two descriptions ) .",
    "in fact , this decoder requires the two - descriptions to be different from one another in order to yield a better reconstruction .",
    "the main challenge in the md problem is to strike a balance between these two situations .",
    "the best known achievable region for the this communications setting is due to zhang and berger @xcite . in the zhang - berger ( zb ) strategy",
    ", the encoder in the first step sends a common and coarsely quantized version of the source on both descriptions , then in the next step , the encoder sends individual refinements for each decoder on the corresponding descriptions .",
    "the zb coding strategy was generalized in @xcite for the case where there are more than two descriptions . in this strategy , first , a common coarsely quantized version of the source is sent to all the decoders , then in the next step , several refinement layers are transmitted . for the symmetric @xmath1descriptions problem ,",
    "a coding scheme based on random binning was considered in @xcite which outperforms the vkg scheme .",
    "this involves generation of independent codebooks followed by random binning . although the md problem has a centralized encoder , the strategy involving random binning",
    "was proved to be useful .",
    "this was further improved upon by a new coding scheme in @xcite based on certain parity - check codes .",
    "however all the three schemes do not fully exploit the common - information among every subset of individual descriptions .",
    "for example in the three - descriptions problem , there can be common - information between the first and second descriptions which is not common with the third description . a new coding scheme called combinatorial message sharing with binning ( cmsb )",
    "was considered in @xcite which provided a unified achievable rd region for the general @xmath0-descriptions problem .",
    "this scheme provided a grand unification of the schemes based on conditional codebooks and the schemes based on random binning , which in turn results in the largest achievable rd region for the problem and subsumes all previous coding schemes .",
    "the name is due to the combinatorial number of common - component codebooks present .",
    "it can be noted that cmsb scheme is based on a construction of random codes where the codewords are mutually independent , and where the codebooks do not have any algebraic structure .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a new coding strategy for the general @xmath0-descriptions problem which strictly subsumes cmsb strategy which is the best known in the literature till now .",
    "the coding strategy is based on the common - information perspective . taking a cue from the two - descriptions zb strategy",
    ", we propose that for the general @xmath0-descriptions problem the encoder constructs a common constituent codebook for each subset of the @xmath2 decoders .",
    "so , for each subset of the decoders there is one common component in the overall coding scheme .",
    "this implies that the number of constituent codebooks grows double - exponentially in @xmath0 .",
    "however , we prove that only an asymptotically exponential number of the codebooks are necessary in terms of contributing to the rate - distortion region , and the rest are redundant .",
    "this significantly simplifies the coding strategy .",
    "as an example , for the @xmath3 case , there are @xmath4 possible common code components , but only @xmath5 of the corresponding codebooks are non - redundant .",
    "it turns out that one can identify all of the non - redundant codebooks by associating them with the sperner families of sets @xcite . as a result",
    ", we call the new scheme the sperner set coding ( ssc ) scheme",
    ". the cmsb scheme utilizes @xmath6 codebooks for the @xmath7-descriptions problem .",
    "we prove analytically that the addition of the @xmath7 new codebooks in the ssc scheme results in an improved achievable rd region .",
    "in other words , we show analytically that the cmsb scheme is not complete .",
    "additionally , we propose a generalized binning approach which improves upon the cmsb scheme and further enhances the ssc scheme .",
    "we characterize the asymptotic performance of this coding scheme using computable single - letter information quantities .",
    "this forms the first part of the paper .",
    "similar to the coding scheme of cmsb , the ssc scheme uses random unstructured codes .",
    "it has been observed in several other multi - terminal communications settings such as the broadcast channel ( bc ) @xcite , interference channel ( ic ) @xcite , variations of the mac channel @xcite@xcite and the distributed source coding ( dsc ) problem @xcite , that the application of algebraic structured codes results in improvements over random unstructured codes in the asymptotic performance limits .",
    "based on the inherent dualities between the multi - terminal communication problems and the corresponding coding schemes , these observations suggest that one may get such gains in performance even in the md problem .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we show that ssc coding scheme which is based on unstructured codes as mentioned above is not complete .",
    "we provide several specific examples of @xmath7- and @xmath8-description problems and example - specific coding schemes based on random linear codes that perform strictly better than the above ssc coding scheme .",
    "subsequently , we supplement the above ssc scheme with new coding layers which have algebraic structure . we restrict our attention to the algebraic structure associated with finite fields .",
    "we present a unified coding scheme which works for arbitrary sources and distortion measures .",
    "we characterize the asymptotic performance of this coding scheme using computable single - letter information quantities .",
    "we interpret the ssc coding as capturing the common information components among @xmath9 decoders using univariate functions , and the algebraic coding supplement as capturing common information among @xmath9 decoders using bivariate and multivariate functions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : notation ] explains the notation used in the paper .",
    "section [ sec : prelim ] provides an overview of the ideas developed in previous works and provides the groundwork for the next sections . in section [ sec : random ] , we present a new unstructured coding strategy which improves upon the cmsb scheme . we show that there are two different types of gains compared to the previous scheme : the first is due to the addition of several common - component codebook layers , the second is due to a more generalized binning method . in section [ sec : linexamples ] , we identify examples where improvements due to structured coding materialize in the md setup . in this section ,",
    "we investigate three different examples . in two of the examples the achievable rd region",
    "is improved via using linear quantizers , and in the other example the gains are due to linear binning . in section [ sec : rdregion ] we generalize the ideas in the previous section and provide an achievable rd region for the general @xmath0-descriptions problem .",
    "since the characterization of rd region is involved and complicated we provide the final rd region through several steps , adding new coding layers in each step .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",

    "one can even interpret the main difference between these schemes to be the way the common - component between different random variables are exploited .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the best known achievable rd region for the @xmath1descriptions problem is the cms with binning ( cmsb ) strategy . in this strategy a combinatorial number of _ common - component _ random variables are considered .",

    "this is an improvement upon the cmsb region using only unstructured codes . in the second step , presented in the next two sections ,",
    "this is enhanced with a structured coding layer which improves the performance even further .",
    "in other words we show that the codebooks associated with the structured coding layer are non - redundant .",

    "the new achievable rd region that we provide improves upon the cmsb rate - distortion region on two factors .",
    "the first comes by adding extra codebooks , and the second comes by a more general binning method . using the common - component perspective , we associate with every non - empty subset @xmath23 of these @xmath146 decoders an auxiliary random variable and a corresponding codebook . that is , we identify the collection of auxiliary variables ( and their codebooks ) with @xmath148 .",
    "each codebook is binned multiple times .",
    "if a description is received by at least one decoder in @xmath23 , then a bin index of the codebook associated with @xmath23 is sent on that description .",

    "@xmath992 and @xmath981 are available at decoder @xmath251 , from optimality at this decoder we must have : @xmath993 so the inequality must be equality , which means @xmath994 .",
    "in other words the markov chain @xmath995 must hold . using the three facts 1 ) @xmath996 ,",

    "so @xmath1014 is as follows :      we can minimize the resulting distortion at decoders 1 and 2 by choosing @xmath1023 and @xmath1004 optimally .",
    "let @xmath1024 be the optimal joint distribution , we will show that there are two choices for @xmath1024 .",
