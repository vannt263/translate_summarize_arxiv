    "the applications of conformal field theory ( cft ) to statistical mechanics are based on the assumption that a statistical model at the critical point admits a non - trivial , conformally invariant , scaling limit , as suggested by the renormalization theory of critical phenomena .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) local scale invariance strongly constraints the structure of the critical theory , as understood by belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "they recognized that the theory is characterized by a dimensionless constant @xmath4 , the central charge , which is associated with an anomaly term in the commutation relations of the stress energy tensor .",
    "the central charge can be also defined in terms of the finite size corrections to the free energy at criticality @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the critical theory is fully characterized by the value of @xmath4 , which takes the form @xmath5 , @xmath6 once @xmath4 is fixed to one of these special values , the critical exponents are all explicitly known in terms of the kac formula @xcite .    in practice , the identification of the critical theory associated with a given microscopic lattice model is done by inspection , by trying to match the known informations about the lattice model s exponents with the kac formula . once a correspondence is established or guessed , a large number of non trivial predictions on the model s correlation functions at criticality can be inferred , which in general can not be analytically derived by other means .",
    "it is therefore important to check these predictions in specific models , which could serve as benchmarks for this scheme .",
    "unfortunately , there are just a few cases , based on exactly solvable lattice models , in which so far this correspondence could be rigorously established .",
    "a remarkable example is the nearest neighbor ising model at the critical point , whose understanding in the scaling limit improved substantially in the last few months @xcite .",
    "more in general , it is very hard to rigorously compute critical exponents , correlation functions or finite size corrections to thermodynamic functions at the critical point . in recent times",
    "new methods for the analysis of non - integrable 2d spin systems , based on the renormalization group , have been developed , starting from @xcite and @xcite , where the authors computed the critical exponent of the so - called energy field operator in a class of perturbed ising models ( such as the one considered in this paper ) and in a class of two stacked interacting ising models ( including the 8 vertex and the ashkin - teller models ) , respectively . by these methods",
    "one can try to verify some of the cft predictions in the context of non solvable lattice models .",
    "in particular in this paper we consider an ising model with a generic ferromagnetic short range interaction , with hamiltonian h =- j__,l_j=1,2__+_j - _\\{,}_v(-)_,[2.1]where @xmath7 and @xmath0 are positive constants , @xmath8 is a finite rectangular box of sides @xmath9 and @xmath10 with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the two unit coordinate vectors on @xmath13 .",
    "the sum in the second term of eq .",
    "is over all unordered pairs of sites in @xmath14 ; the interaction potential @xmath15 is rotation invariant , positive and has finite range , namely : @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the case @xmath18 corresponds to the nearest - neighbor ising model which is exactly solvable @xcite ; in the case @xmath19 no solution is known but in @xcite the exponent of the energy - energy correlation was computed and shown to be _ universal _",
    "( i.e. , equal to @xmath20 as in the @xmath18 case ) , in contrast with the critical temperature or the amplitude of the correlations which are model dependent .",
    "a number of key informations on the system are encoded in the _ partition function _ : z_(_,l)= _ _,l e^-h( ) .",
    "[ 0.1]at all temperatures , the thermodynamic limit for the _ pressure _ is well - defined and independent of the speed at which @xmath10 and @xmath9 are sent to infinity : p_=_,l1 lz_(_,l).while the mere existence of the limit can be proved very generally , based on convexity and subadditivity arguments @xcite , the explicit form of @xmath21 can be computed either by the onsager s solution ( for @xmath18 ) or by cluster expansion and renormalization group analysis ( for @xmath0 sufficiently small , see below ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath21 depends explicitly on @xmath0 , at all temperatures @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , at all temperatures but the critical one , the limit is reached exponentially fast . at @xmath23",
    "the limit is reached polynomially , and we shall define @xmath24 .",
    "remarkably , according to the ideas and methods of cft , the finite size corrections to @xmath25 are expected to be universal , in particular independent of @xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "more precisely , in the presence of periodic boundary conditions , ref.@xcite predicted the validity of the following formula , asymptotically for large @xmath10 : _",
    "l = f_+1 ^ 2+o(1 ^ 2).[a.11]where @xmath4 is the central charge of the critical theory . for the nearest neighbor ising model @xmath27 and",
    "supposedly the same should be true for perturbed ising models of the form .",
    "our main results is a rigorous confirmation of this expectation .",
    "[ thm1 ] given the model with @xmath0 positive and small enough , there exists a critical temperature @xmath28 such that eq",
    ". holds with c=1/2[c12 ]    recall that the critical exponent of the energy field operator is known to be universal and equal to 2 @xcite , as expected from the use of the kac formula at @xmath27 ( see e.g. @xcite ) : therefore , our result says not only that the finite size corrections to the free energy are universal at criticality and that the corresponding central charge is constant , but also that such central charge has the _ right value _ , i.e. the one matching with the one guessed from the critical exponents and the kac formula .",
    "this is a very non trivial connection , predicted by cft , between critical exponents and finite size corrections to the thermodynamic functions , and our results is the first proof of the correctness of this prediction in a non - integrable statistical model .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend the connection to the critical exponent of the spin field operator , but this seems a much harder problem than the one solved here ; on the basis of the above correspondence , such exponent is expected to be @xmath29 , but its rigorous computation at @xmath30 is still beyond reach of the current techniques .",
    "another very interesting extension would be to prove an analogous universality result for statistical models with @xmath31 , such as the 8 vertex or the ashkin - teller model . in these cases",
    "several critical exponents have been computed and proved to be @xmath0-dependent @xcite , as expected from cft ; at the same time , the finite size correction to the free energy are expected to be independent of @xmath0 and given by eq.([a.11 ] ) with @xmath31 , but this fact is unproved so far .",
    "we hope to come back to this question in a future publication .    in the case of the nearest - neighbor ising model , @xmath18 , the result eq.([c12 ] )",
    "was proved by @xcite and follows from the exact solution .",
    "if @xmath30 , the proof of our main theorem uses a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis first introduced in @xcite for the computation of the two - point energy correlation function , and recently extended in @xcite to the analysis of the @xmath32-point energy correlations .",
    "in addition to the ideas of @xcite , we use here some novel partition function inequalities , which we can only prove for ferromagnetic interactions , @xmath33 .",
    "the assumption of positivity of the interaction is expected to be technical and we believe that the analogue of theorem [ thm1 ] should hold also for @xmath0 small and negative .",
    "more in detail , our proof proceeds as follows .",
    "we start by writing the partition function of the interacting ising model as a sum of four grassmann integrals with different boundary conditions , in a way that naturally extends the analogous representation for the nearest neighbor model . using a partition function inequality ,",
    "we reduce ourselves to the study of just one out of these four grassmann partition functions , namely the one with antiperiodic boundary conditions ; we prove that the other three terms are subleading and do not contribute to the central charge . on the other side ,",
    "the grassmann partition function with antiperiodic boundary conditions can be rewritten as the product of two terms : the first is equal to the non - interacting grassmann partition function with renormalized parameters ( this is the contribution from the  infrared fixed point \" ) , while the rest includes all the corrections coming from finite infrared scales and from the irrelevant terms .",
    "now , remarkably :    1 .",
    "the dependence of the first factor upon the renormalized parameters can be scaled out by a simple change of variables , after which the factor takes the form @xmath34(free partition function ) , with @xmath35 the  wave function renormalization \" , which is volume - independent ; therefore , the presence of the renormalized parameters changes the bulk pressure , but not the finite size corrections ; 2 .",
    "the rest can be studied by a multiscale analysis , which requires the introduction of two running coupling constants , playing the role of wave function and critical temperature counterterms ; these running coupling constant go to zero exponentially fast in the infrared limit , thanks to a dimensional improvement in the dimensional bounds following from the fact that the theory is super - renormalizable , in the sense that all the field operators with more than two fields are irrelevant in the rg sense ; correspondingly , the finite size corrections to the pressure coming from these term can be shown to go to zero faster than @xmath36 as the infrared cutoff @xmath10 is removed , namely like @xmath37 , for @xmath38 .",
    "the strategy resembles closely the one used in @xcite to prove the universality of the optical conductivity in interacting graphene .",
    "an extra difficulty that we have to face in our case is the definition of the localization and renormalization procedure at finite volume , which uses and extends the strategy proposed in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec22 ]",
    "we review the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] in the non - interacting case @xmath18 . in section [ sec33 ]",
    "we prove the main theorem in the @xmath30 case : we first review the grassmann representation of the interacting partition function ( section [ sec3.1 ] ) ; then we state the partition function inequality that we use to effectively eliminate three out of the four grassmann partition function ( section [ sec3.2 ] ) ; next we describe the rg computation of the antiperiodic grassmann partition function ( section [ subsec3.3 ] ) , and we use it to compute the bulk and subleading contributions to the pressure ( section [ subsec3.4 ] ) . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we prove the partition function inequality stated in section [ sec3.2 ] . in the appendix",
    ", we study a subleading correction to the pressure coming from the ratio of the grassmann partition functions , both in the non - interacting ( appendix [ seca.1 ] ) and in the interacting case ( appendix [ subsec3.4 ] ) .",

    "the proof can be found in @xcite , but is reproduced here for the reader s convenience . from now on we shall drop the dependence on @xmath22 in the symbol used for the partition function , in order to avoid a too cumbersome notation .",
    "we shall be as explicit as possible in distinguishing the formulas where the value of @xmath22 is generic from those where @xmath22 is fixed to be the critical one .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath10 and @xmath9 are even , in order to simplify the signs appearing in some formulas .",
    "the starting point is the representation of the n.n .",
    "ising model s partition function @xmath39 with periodic boundary conditions and bond - dependent link variables in terms of a sum over multipolygons ( see e.g. @xcite ) : z^0(\\{j_b};_,l)=2^l__,l _ _ b(j_b),[h13 ] where @xmath40 is the set of n.n .",

    "note that some of the polygons in @xmath41 can wind up the torus @xmath14 , due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
