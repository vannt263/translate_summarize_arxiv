    "the sources of gamma ray bursts ( grb s ) and of cosmic rays ( cr s ) with energy @xmath4 are unknown . in particular , most of the sources of cosmic rays that have been proposed have difficulties in accelerating cr s up to the highest observed energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent gamma ray and cosmic ray observations give increasing evidence that both phenomena are of cosmological origin [ see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for grb s ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for cr s ] .",
    "although the source of grb s is unknown , their observational characteristics impose strong constraints on the physical conditions in the @xmath5-ray emitting region ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which imply that protons may be accelerated in the @xmath5-ray emitting region to energies @xmath6 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the average rate ( over volume and time ) at which energy is emitted as @xmath5-rays by grb s and in cr s above @xmath7 in the cosmological scenario is , remarkably , comparable ( @xcite , b ) .",
    "these two facts suggest that grb s and high - energy cr s may have a common origin",
    ".    an essential ingredient of a bursting model for cosmic rays is the time delay due to inter - galactic magnetic fields .",
    "the energy of the most energetic cr detected by the fly s eye experiment is in excess of @xmath8 ( @xcite ) , and that of the most energetic agasa event is above @xmath9 ( @xcite ) . on a cosmological scale ,",
    "the distance traveled by such energetic particles is small : @xmath10 for the agasa event , @xmath11 for the fly s eye event ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the detection of these events over a @xmath12 period can be reconciled with the rate of nearby grb s ( @xmath13 per @xmath14 in the field of view of the cr experiments out to @xmath15 in a standard cosmological scenario ; e.g. , @xcite ) only if there is a large dispersion in the arrival time of protons produced in a single burst .",
    "the required dispersion , @xmath16 for @xmath9 proton , may be produced by inter - galactic magnetic fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "the deflection angle for a proton propagating a distance @xmath17 in a magnetic field @xmath18 with coherence length @xmath19 is @xmath20 , and the induced time delay is @xmath21 . since the time delay is energy dependent , the large spread in proton energy , induced by random energy loss , results in a time broadening of the cr pulse over a time @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the cr s from a single burst can be received on earth over a long time interval",
    ". nevertheless , since the angular deflection is small , the individual sources are still detectable by measuring the arrival directions .    in this _ letter _ , we examine the characteristics of cr sources that should be expected in a bursting source model , as a function of the time delay , dependent on the magnetic field .",
    "we find that there are characteristic signatures for such a model , which would allow to distinguish it from a scenario where the cr sources are steady , i.e. , where the sources emit a constant flux on a time scale longer than the time delay of the lowest energy cr s that are relevant . in ",
    "2.1 we give a qualitative description of the bursting model properties , using an approximate analytic approach . in  2.2",
    "we present monte - carlo simulations that demonstrate the properties discussed in  2.1 .",
    "the various tests of the bursting model and the implications for future high energy cr experiments are discussed in  3 .",
    "we consider a cosmic ray burst ( crb ) taking place at a distance @xmath17 from us , where a total number of protons @xmath23 of energy @xmath24 is emitted at a single instant in time .",
    "the cr s arrive with a time delay @xmath25 , relative to gamma - rays , with a probability density @xmath26{\\rm d}[t/\\tau(d , e)]$ ] , where @xmath27 is the characteristic time delay . the time delay @xmath25 at a fixed energy and distance varies randomly due to two effects .",
    "first , the magnetic field along a trajectory should have random variations ; for example , if the magnetic fields originate in galaxies and are later ejected to the inter - galactic medium , the field strength along a trajectory should vary depending on the impact parameter to individual galaxies . in the absence of energy losses ,",
    "the bursting source would produce a number of cosmic ray `` images '' , and the cosmic rays in each image would be of a single energy which would decrease with time as @xmath28 .",
    "however , the random nature of the energy loss of a cosmic ray eliminates these images , and simply introduces a dispersion in the arrival times and arrival directions at a fixed energy . in general , the dispersion in arrival times @xmath25 will be of order @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now perform a simple analytic calculation of the number of cr sources that should be seen at each energy and flux in a crb model . for this purpose , we approximate the effect of energy losses as being negligible when cr s come from a distance @xmath30 , and eliminating all cosmic rays coming from @xmath31 ( for @xmath32 , this approximation is quite good and @xmath33 corresponds to the distance where the initial proton energy necessary to have an observed energy @xmath24 , after losses to electron - positron production , exceeds the threshold for pion production ) .",
    "we also assume that the sources are observed only during a time @xmath29 with a constant flux @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "if the rate per unit volume of crb s is @xmath36 , all emitting the same @xmath37 , then the average number of bursts at distance @xmath17 observed at any time is @xmath38\\ , { \\rm d}d$ ] , giving a number of bursts at a given observed flux @xmath39^{5/4}\\ , { { \\rm d}f\\over f}\\quad ,   \\label{n}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the flux @xmath41 is the minimum flux observed for the sources . in our simplified model ,",
    "the number of sources drops to zero abruptly at @xmath41 owing to the assumed distance cutoff @xmath33 and the `` top - hat '' time profile . in reality",
    ", there should be a smooth turnover at @xmath41 of the number of crb sources from the @xmath42 power - law slope at the bright end .",
    "this result for bursting sources is in contrast to the usual @xmath43 euclidean slope , which applies for steady sources of cosmic rays .",
    "the total average number of sources above flux @xmath44 is @xmath45^{5/4}\\quad , \\label{n}\\ ] ] and the average background flux resulting from all the sources is @xmath46 the background flux is dominated by sources with flux near @xmath41 , although the contribution from brighter sources decreases only as @xmath47 .",
    "as the cosmic ray energy is increased , the average number of bursts observed above the turnover flux @xmath41 decreases , and there is a critical energy @xmath3 where this average number of sources equals unity : @xmath48 we can write the average number of sources in terms of @xmath3 as @xmath49 = \\left ( e_{\\rm crit}\\over e \\right)^2 \\left [ d_c(e)\\over d_c(e_{\\rm crit } ) \\right]^5 \\quad . \\label{nc}\\ ] ]    the number of sources @xmath50 drops rapidly with energy , due to the strong dependence on the decreasing cutoff distance @xmath33 .",
    "the drop is especially rapid near @xmath9 , where @xmath33 decreases quickly ( see fig . 2 below ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath51 , the number of sources contributing to the flux is very large , and the total number of cr s received at any given time is near the average background @xmath52 .",
    "the brightest source has a typical flux @xmath53(e / e_{\\rm crit})^{2/5}[d_c(e)/d_c(e_{\\rm crit})]^{-1}$ ] , although there is a probability to observe a source with @xmath54 , @xmath55^{-5/4}$ ] . at @xmath56 , the total energy received in cr s",
    "will generally be much lower than the average @xmath52 , because there will be no burst within a distance @xmath33 having taken place sufficiently recently .",
    "the few cr s may be the lucky survivors from sources further than @xmath33 , or they may have anomalously long time - delays as a result of crossing a region of high magnetic field ( probably near a galaxy )",
    ". there is , however , a probability @xmath57 of seeing one cr source with @xmath56 having a flux @xmath58 , or an even brighter one with probability decreasing as @xmath59 .",
    "if the cr sources are steady , then the number of sources decreases with energy only as @xmath60 , i.e. , much more slowly than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ nc ] ) .",
    "this implies that for a given critical energy , the number of bright sources at @xmath61 predicted by a model of steady sources is much larger than that predicted for bursting sources .",
    "bursting cr sources should have narrowly peaked energy spectra , and therefore the brightest sources should be different at different energies .",
    "for example , if a bright source is observed at @xmath56 , the burst must have taken place recently in order that the high energy cosmic rays are just arriving on earth , so lower energy cosmic rays will not have arrived yet .",
    "typically , there will be other brighter sources at @xmath51 , corresponding to bursts that took place a longer time ago , and probably closer to us ( since there is a longer time interval available ) .",
    "this is in marked contrast to a model of steady state sources , where the brightest source at high energies should also be the brightest one at low energies , its fractional contribution to the background decreasing to low energy only as @xmath62 .",
    "we now present the results of a monte - carlo simulation of the total number of cosmic rays received from crb s at some fixed time .",
    "for each realization we randomly draw the positions ( distances from earth ) and times at which cosmological crb s occured , assuming that the crb s are homogeneously distributed standard candles with an average rate @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 ) similar to that fitted to the observed flux distribution of grb s assuming a no - evolution standard candle model ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume an intrinsic cosmic ray generation spectrum @xmath65 , which produces a flux above @xmath66 consistent with the fly s eye and agasa data ( waxman 1995b ) .",
    "we calculate the change of the spectrum due to interaction with the cmb photons in a method similar to that described in waxman ( 1995b ) , except that for distances @xmath67 we do not use the continuous energy loss approximation but rather an exact calculation of the energy loss , which includes fluctuations .    for the probability distribution of the time - delay for a cosmic ray of fixed energy from a source at a given distance , we use the form @xmath68 for @xmath69 , @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the characteristic time - delay and is proportional to @xmath75 , and @xmath76^{-1}$ ] . for @xmath77 the form of the probability function",
    "approximately matches results obtained by waxman & coppi ( 1995 ) .",
    "cosmic rays with large @xmath78 are the ones that have crossed regions of high magnetic field , and we assume there is a power - law distribution of magnetic field strengths , giving a power - law distribution of time delays . if the typical field in the inter - galactic medium is @xmath18 and has coherence length @xmath19 , the typical deflection angle is @xmath79 . when intercepting a region with magnetic field @xmath80 and coherence length @xmath81 , the deflection angle is @xmath82 , yielding a time delay @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath84 is the number density of such regions , the interception probability is @xmath85 , so the index @xmath86 is @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "here , we shall use as an example @xmath88 years , corresponding to @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we also take @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , giving typical parameters for spiral galaxies ( this leads to @xmath94 , with a weak dependence on distance ) .",
    "we have examined a total of 50 realizations .",
    "about 70% of these are similar to the realization presented in fig .",
    "1a : there is no source sufficiently nearby having occurred sufficiently recently , so the flux at high energies is below the average . in the other @xmath95 , there are typically one or two bright sources dominating at @xmath96 , as in the realization presented in fig .",
    "a source similar to the brightest one in fig .",
    "1b appears only @xmath97 of the time ( in this example , the source is at @xmath98 and occurred 51 years ago ) ; the second brightest source at @xmath99 ev in fig .",
    "1b is more common .",
    "the analytic expression ( [ n ] ) for @xmath100 provides a good approximation to the numerical results for the number of sources with flux @xmath44 and spectral peak at @xmath24 , except that sources at high energy are also present at fluxes below @xmath41 , coming from crb s at distances higher than @xmath33 for which some high energy cosmic rays still survive .",
    "the spectral shape of the individual sources is determined by the time - delay probability distribution we have assumed , and is slightly modified by the interaction with the microwave background ( this is the reason why the shape of the spectra of different sources varies ) .",
    "2 shows @xmath101 , calculated from the average background and equations ( [ b ] ) and ( [ nc ] ) .",
    "since our numerical model does not assume a sharp cutoff in the flux distribution , as we did above in the analytical model , @xmath101 is here an indication of the number of sources above the turnover flux , which dominate the contribution to the average background .",
    "all the characteristics of the sources depend on the crb rate @xmath36 and on the characteristic time delay @xmath102 only through their product @xmath103 , or , equivalently , through the critical energy @xmath104 . for the parameters we have chosen , @xmath105 , fig .",
    "2 shows that @xmath106 ev .",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath103 is easily determined from fig .",
    "2 , since @xmath107 ( see eqs .",
    "[ ec]-[nc ] ) and therefore the curve in fig .",
    "2 shifts vertically as @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath0 cr s are indeed produced by grb s , then @xmath36 is determined by the grb flux distribution .",
    "the time delay , however , depends on the unknown properties of the inter - galactic magnetic field , @xmath108 .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , current data requires @xmath109 , or , equivalently , @xmath110 ev , which corresponds to @xmath111 .",
    "the current upper limit for the inter - galactic magnetic field , @xmath112 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , allows a much larger delay , @xmath113 .",
    "however , the rapid decrease of @xmath101 with energy near @xmath9 , implies that @xmath3 is not very sensitive to @xmath103 .",
    "thus , for the range allowed for the grb model , @xmath114 , the critical energy is limited to the range @xmath115 .",
    "we have analyzed a model where @xmath0 cr s are produced by cosmological sources bursting at a rate comparable to grb s .",
    "we have found that , in this model , the average number of cr sources contributing to the flux decreases with energy much more rapidly than in the case where the cr sources are steady . we have shown that a critical energy exists , @xmath116 , above which a few sources produce most of the cr s , and that the observed spectra of these sources is very narrow : the bright sources at high energy should be totally absent in cosmic rays of substantially lower energy , since particles take longer to arrive the lower their energy .",
    "in contrast , a model of steady sources predicts that the brightest sources at high energies should also be the brightest ones at low energies .    above @xmath3",
    ", there is a significant probability to observe one source with a flux considerably higher than average .",
    "if such a source is present , its narrow spectrum may produce a `` gap '' in the overall spectrum , as in fig .",
    "recently , @xcite argued that the observation of such an energy gap would imply that the sources of @xmath117 cr s are different from the sources at lower energy , hinting that the highest energy cr s are produced by the decay of a new type of massive particles .",
    "we see here that this is not the case when bursting sources are allowed , owing to the time variability .",
    "if such an energy gap is present , our model predicts that most of the cosmic rays above the gap should normally come from one source .",
    "if our model is correct , then the fly s eye event above @xmath8 suggests that we live at one of the times when a bright source is present at high energies .",
    "however , the absence of such a source can not be ruled out , since , for example , the probability to have detected the fly s eye event in the realization of fig . 1a , where no bright source exists , is @xmath118 .",
    "the highest energy agasa event might more easily be produced by a common , faint source ( like in fig .",
    "furthermore , notice that , given that fly s eye has detected only one cosmic ray with @xmath119 ev , we already know that the agasa cosmic ray had a low probability of being detected ; within the measurement error , its energy might be not much above @xmath120  ev .    given the present scarcity of ultra - high energy cr s , no solid conclusions can be drawn .",
    "however , with the projected auger experiment ( @xcite ) , the number of detected cr s would increase by a factor @xmath121 .",
    "if @xmath3 is @xmath122 , as predicted by our model , then a few bright sources above @xmath9 should be identified .",
    "in addition , for @xmath123 our model predicts @xmath124 sources producing more then @xmath125 events at @xmath126 , compared to @xmath127 such sources predicted in a steady source model with a similar @xmath128 .",
    "the observed characteristics of high energy cr sources depend on the bursting rate @xmath36 and on the typical time delay @xmath129 only through their product @xmath103 .",
    "however , @xmath36 and @xmath129 may be measured separately , if the time delay is either very short , @xmath130 , or very long , @xmath131 . in the former case ,",
    "time variability of high energy sources may be detected , while in the latter , which implies large magnetic fields , dispersion in cr arrival directions could be measured .",
    "the magnetic field of our galaxy can also have interesting observable effects : the images of crb sources should appear elongated perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field , with a predictable correlation of the cosmic ray position and energy .",
    "for example , a cosmic ray with @xmath132 could be deflected by @xmath133 when arriving along the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the positions of cosmic rays could also be correlated with those of nearby galaxies to see if the events producing them occur in normal stellar populations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the identification with grb s could then lead to further constraints on the nature of the objects producing these explosions .",
