    "the study of disordered systems has attracted a wide interest in statistical physics .",
    "numerical studies appear of critical importance in the field , as the handling of disorder can be difficultly amenable to analytic treatments . in any case",
    "numerical approaches appear to be the best suited for capturing details of interesting behaviours , such as those related to finite - size effects .    in this background , the disordered poland - scheraga ( ps ) model for dna denaturation stands as a privileged model , following several perspectives : i ) as an instance of the so - called `` helix - coil transition '' models ,",
    "the model is designed to capture one of the most basic phenomenon in molecular biology , relative to the opening of the double - helix ; ii ) to render the helix - coil transition model more realistic , the ps model takes into account intrinsic long - range effects ( associated with the weights of the loops in the coiled state ) , which can extend throughout the length of the system ; iii ) originally specifically associated with the model , numerical methods were developed to handle the statistical mechanics problem with long - range effects very efficiently , allowing to consider system sizes which are orders of magnitude larger than what would be possible with monte - carlo methods .    with this respect ,",
    "the ps model of dna denaturation with self - avoidance is of particular interest , notably as it belongs to a more general class of polymer models for which the question of disorder relevance has been definitely answered only recently @xcite , in a probabilistic mathematical framework .",
    "more precisely , for this class of models , disorder is predicted to be relevant , the transition being expected to be at least of second order . in such context , the numerical findings of our previous work @xcite , relying on a standard finite size scaling analysis , indeed agree with a smooth transition , suggesting a value @xmath4 for the correlation length exponent .",
    "in contrast , other studies of the dna denaturation model with self - avoidance @xcite instead supported , both on numerical and theoretical grounds , the possibility of a pseudo first order transition .",
    "such scenario could be in fact accommodated within theoretical descriptions of relevant models , such as random ferromagnets , with , in any case , disorder expected to be relevant from the harris criterion point of view . briefly , within this picture , one predicts the presence of two correlation lengths , which can be evidenced numerically in particular by an analysis in terms of ( appropriately defined , sequence - dependent ) _ pseudo - critical temperatures _ , since the two corresponding exponents should rule the scaling of the mean value and that of the fluctuations of the pseudo-@xmath0 , respectively . in detail , in these studies , the exponent related to the fluctuations was found to have the value 2 , thus coherent with a second order transition ( and , from this point of view , with disorder relevance ) , whereas the one related to the mean value was found to have the value 1 , thus , concomitantly , denoting a pseudo first order character of this transition .",
    "in fact , based on recent mathematical findings , @xcite it would be possible to rule out such scenario for the thermodynamic limit behaviour of the present model .",
    "this situation is further reinforced by the prediction , within the same probabilistic mathematical framework , of a thermodynamic limit behaviour governed by a single correlation length @xcite .",
    "the general situation as described above motivates the present extensive numerical study , in the prolongation of our previous work , since it appears desirable to clarify the overall situation relative to the theoretical / numerical results , all the more that in @xcite extremely large sizes were considered ( up to @xmath5 ) , which should in principle be appropriate for reflecting the thermodynamic limit properties evidenced in the theoretical studies .",
    "it is in this direction that we perform here a finite size scaling analysis in terms of pseudo - critical temperatures . in any event , for the present peculiar model , displaying strong corrections to scaling and a slow approach to the asymptotic regime @xcite , a general deeper understanding of the finite size behaviour is of interest both from the physics and biological points of view .",
    "more precisely , we tackle a hitherto unaddressed problem , relative to the definition of appropriate pseudo - critical temperatures in the presence of multiple peaks in quantities such as the specific heat and the susceptibility , which represent as a matter of fact a salient feature of the underlying biological model . focusing on the strongly non self - averaging behaviour of observables at the critical point",
    ", we find that the pseudo-@xmath0 can be appropriately defined as the position of the absolute maximum of susceptibility , for a given sequence .",
    "we notably show that the mean value and the fluctuations of this observable scale with the same exponent , thereby confirming that the asymptotic regime is reached in our case . at variance with the numerical findings in @xcite ,",
    "the present result is thus coherent with the typical picture describing random ferromagnets when disorder is relevant .    in order to understand in depth the finite size behaviour",
    ", we further perform an extensive analysis of the loop - length probability distribution , at different temperatures .",
    "the behaviour of this observable reveals in a particularly evident way the presence of a _ crossover _ chain length @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , this quantity appears to be particularly appropriate for characterizing the slow approach to the asymptotic regime in the present model . basically , for chain lengths below @xmath3 , in our study the behaviour of the model would also agree with the scenario of a pseudo first order transition . as a matter of fact",
    ", the evaluation of @xmath3 in our case , and the approximate prediction within a phenomenological framework of its dependence on the parameters of the model , allows us to resolve the possible paradox concerning contradictory numerical findings as described above .",
    "we show notably that , with the choice of parameters in @xcite , it could be not possible to reach the asymptotic regime in practice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we briefly review the general background in section [ zero ] ; we introduce the model and the observables in section [ beginning ] , where we first summarize known results for the pure case ( [ beginning_one ] ) , we introduce the disordered model , by defining the different parameters entering in the computation of the partition function by means of the recursive equations ( [ beginning_two ] ) , we describe possible scenarios within the framework of the analysis in terms of pseudo - critical temperatures , clarifying the different ways of averaging considered ( [ beginning_three ] ) , we recall the approximation used for the power law and the details of the numerical implementation of the computations ( [ beginning_four ] ) ; we present and discuss our results on the analysis with the pseudo - critical temperatures in section [ discussion1 ] , where we start from the possible definitions of this observable ( [ discussion1_one ] ) , we study the scaling of its mean value and of its fluctuations ( [ discussion1_two ] ) , we compare different ways of averaging ( [ discussion1_three ] ) , and we show data on the non self - averageness parameter related to the susceptibility ( [ discussion1_four ] ) ; we present and discuss our results on the characterization of the finite size behaviour in section [ discussion2 ] , where we outline the presence of the crossover chain length @xmath3 by the detailed study of data on the loop - length probability distribution ( [ discussion2_one ] ) , and we discuss our attempt to roughly estimate the dependence of this quantity on the parameters of the model ( [ discussion2_two ] ) ; finally , we present our conclusions in section [ ending ] .",
    "a realistic model for the dna denaturation transition ( taking into account the entropic weights of the loops ) was introduced by poland and scheraga ( ps ) @xcite , to account for experimental melting curves , allowing their prediction @xcite .",
    "models for dna denaturation were originally developed in the context of fundamental biological questions , relevant notably to the possible overlap between physical ( helix / coil ) and genetic ( coding / non - coding ) segmentations of genomic sequences ( for an overview see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the ps model appeared to be also of interest in the context of statistical mechanics : the segmentation of the dna chain into helix / coil regions represents an instance of an _ almost uni - dimensional _",
    "system @xcite , which can undergo a phase transition because of the long range effects , associated with the entropic weights of the loops ( with the loop - length probability distribution described by an exponent @xmath6 ) .    in fact , upon introducing the @xmath6 value appropriate for taking into account loop self - avoidance effects , larger than the one describing a random walk loop , it was hypothesized early on @xcite that a more complete handling of self - avoidance , taking also into account the self - avoidance of the chain with itself , would lead to an even larger value for the exponent , and correspondingly to a sharper transition in the @xmath7 case ( homogeneous sequence ) .",
    "however the confirmation of this hypothesis @xcite had to await conformal field theory results @xcite , showing that the correct loop - length probability distribution exponent associated to a self - avoiding loop embedded in a self - avoiding chain in three dimensions fulfills the condition @xmath8 , leading to a first order singularity ( with corresponding correlation length critical exponent @xmath9 ) .",
    "the first order character of the transition was initially observed in a numerical study of a on - lattice homogeneous model consisting of two interacting self - avoiding walks ( saws ) @xcite , with the numerical estimation ( @xmath10 ) in this case @xcite in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions mentioned above .",
    "it can be noted that , because of the difference between the link energies of @xmath11 ( adenine - thymine ) and @xmath12 ( guanine - cytosine ) base pairs , dna is an intrinsically @xmath13 system in which the disordered variables are @xmath14 , in the sense that the composition of the sequence in terms of base pairs does not vary during the denaturation process .",
    "accordingly , to understand the behaviour of the system in the thermodynamic limit of chain length @xmath15 in the _ canonical _ ensemble , it is necessary to evaluate the quenched free energy density , by taking the average ( over the random variables ) of the logarithm of the partition function for the generated disordered configurations .",
    "however , it appears particularly hard to handle such quantity analytically @xcite .",
    "in fact , whereas the equilibrium properties of the pure system were well understood , it was only recently that probabilistic mathematical approaches @xcite allowed to definitely demonstrate that general theoretical results relative to the relevance of disorder @xcite do also hold for the depinning transition of disordered copolymers .",
    "this conclusion holds in particular for the ps models with @xmath16 , despite the fact that such models are instances of peculiar first order transitions , characterized by the presence of a diverging correlation length , in a system in which the disorder couples to only one of the two phases .",
    "accordingly , such cases are expected to exhibit a random fixed point corresponding to a second order or possibly smoother transition , described by a correlation length critical exponent @xmath17 ( with , to our knowledge , no theoretical prediction available for the @xmath1 value ) .    whereas these theoretical determinations are appropriate to account for the behaviour of the model in the thermodynamic limit , in the experimental situation",
    "we are typically concerned with the thermal denaturation of dna molecules of specific sequence and given finite size . in such context",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the intrinsic disorder is at the origin of the well - known multi - step behaviour of the density of closed base pairs , @xmath18 , the order parameter of the transition as accessible through optical absorbance measurements .",
    "it is then classical to analyze the derivative of this quantity with respect to temperature ( @xmath19 ) , which displays distinct peaks as reflecting the multi - step behaviour . at this level , from the statistical mechanics point of view ,",
    "the first order character of the transition in the pure case is in agreement with the observation that the steps are typically very steep , hence the corresponding peaks very sharp . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that gc - rich regions tend to open at higher temperatures than at - rich ones , suggests in a particularly evident way the possibility of _ non self - averageness _ for densities of extensive quantities , in the sense that the positions and the characteristics of the steps , and of the corresponding peaks , are strongly sequence - dependent .    on general grounds",
    ", it is accordingly expected @xcite that , for @xmath15 , the temperature range where such behaviour is observed shrinks around the critical temperature @xmath0 , the transition being rounded .",
    "in fact , it is only at the critical point that the presence of a diverging correlation length breaks down the argument usually used to demonstrate self - averageness of densities of extensive quantities @xcite , built on the description of the system as consisting of weakly interacting sub - systems .",
    "however the validity of such picture is not obvious for the present almost one - dimensional polymer model , in which self - avoidance represents an infinite range interaction .    in the background of the recent mathematical findings",
    "@xcite , it is expected that the effect of disorder on this peculiar first order transition would be the same than the one predicted theoretically for random ferromagnets @xcite ( as further confirmed numerically in @xcite for site dilute ising models ) , with in particular the mean value and the fluctuations of an appropriately defined pseudo - critical temperature scaling with the same exponent .",
    "nevertheless it is highly desirable for the present model to further assess numerically this picture , in order notably to better understand _ the way in which _ relevance of disorder becomes manifest , as tackled at the finite size level .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we first recall briefly the salient features of the homogeneous on - lattice model which was introduced in @xcite : two saws with the same origin on a @xmath20 cubic lattice , obeying the simple rule that two monomers can occupy the same lattice point ( gaining a coupling energy @xmath21 ) if and only if their positions along the two chains are identical .",
    "the thermal variables describing the system can be represented by the ensemble of the @xmath22 , with @xmath23 if the base pair in position @xmath24 is in the open state and @xmath25 if it is in the closed state .",
    "the possible configurations are only the ones allowed by self - avoidance , thus introducing an infinite range interaction of entropic nature in an almost uni - dimensional ising model @xcite .",
    "the energetic contribution of a given configuration to the boltzmann weight of the `` spins '' @xmath22 ( hence the associated hamiltonian ) is then simply written as @xmath26 .",
    "it can be noticed that @xmath21 enters in the partition function only through the ratio @xmath27 , allowing thus to set @xmath28 without loss of generality .",
    "this model can in particular be assimilated to a homogeneous dna denaturation transition model _  la _",
    "ps @xcite , in which the two chains represent the two strands of the double helix , allowing for one free - end but not base - pair mismatches .",
    "it is then interesting to notice that self - avoidance is fully taken into account in the on - lattice numerical simulations , by design .",
    "in fact , it is found @xcite that , in the thermodynamic limit of infinite chain length @xmath15 , the model undergoes a first order phase transition with a discontinuity in the order parameter , the density of closed base pairs @xmath29 ( @xmath30 holding for the @xmath31 average ) , which varies abruptly from zero value at high temperature to a finite value below the critical temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the properties of the system are better grasped in the behaviour of the loop - length probability distribution @xcite : @xmath32 in which appear both the exponent @xmath6 , describing the purely algebraic decay of @xmath33 at the critical point , and the correlation length @xmath34 . in the considered case , in which we allow for one free - end , it could be necessary in principle to take into account an additional length scale , corresponding to the distance between end points @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such requirement should be basically considered to be associated with a boundary condition @xcite , therefore not influencing the thermodynamic limit properties of the model .",
    "in general , upon solving these models in the _ grand canonical _ ensemble , the succession of closed segments ( helix ) and open loops ( coil regions ) sums up as a geometric series @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case , such treatment amounts to neglect the self - avoiding interactions between different segments and loops , which can be taken into account more correctly by the appropriate renormalization of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "transitions in homogeneous ps models are then found to be of first order , both in @xmath35 and in @xmath36 .",
    "accordingly , they are characterized by an order parameter critical exponent @xmath37 , _ i.e. _ a discontinuity in @xmath38 , but also by the presence of a diverging correlation length , with related critical exponent @xmath9 ( since renormalization leads to @xmath8 ) . in the theoretical framework of almost uni - dimensional phase transitions",
    "this correlation length is to be interpreted as the _ longitudinal _",
    "one @xcite , corresponding to the mean loop length @xmath39 along the chain , whose variance diverges .",
    "more in detail , based on conformal field theory results @xcite , the theoretical prediction in @xmath35 for a self - avoiding loop embedded in a self - avoiding chain @xcite leads to a @xmath6 value between 2.115 and 2.22 , in very good agreement with the value @xmath10 found in numerical study of the on - lattice saw dna model @xcite .",
    "the behaviours at criticality expected for the singular parts of the various thermodynamic quantities in ps models are summarized in [ tab .",
    "1 ] , defining implicitly the order parameter critical exponent @xmath40 , the correlation length critical exponent @xmath41 , and the specific heat critical exponent @xmath42 ( the label @xmath43 is to distinguish the pure @xmath43 case from the random @xmath44 one ) , all of them being expressible as functions of the sole variable @xmath6 .",
    "it can be noticed in particular that here the energy behaves as the order parameter , hence the singular part of the specific heat behaves as the one of the derivative of the order parameter with respect to the temperature , as well as to that of its derivative with respect to @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _ to the singular part of the susceptibility .",
    "moreover @xmath0 is to be reached from the low temperature phase , as the thermodynamic limit correlation length is infinite in the whole phase @xmath45 ( both with and without one free - end allowed ) .",
    "@xmath46    it can be useful to recall , in order to better specify the link between the on - lattice @xmath20 saw dna model and the associated ps one , that the transition in the grand canonical ensemble occurs in fact at a tri - critical point in the fugacity - temperature plane ( see @xcite and references therein ) , better described by the crossover exponent @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the geometrical correlation length critical exponent ( given by the inverse of the fractal dimension @xmath49 of the @xmath20 saw ) , whereas @xmath50 corresponds to the thermal correlation length critical exponent .",
    "accordingly , the relation @xmath51 ( which in ps models corresponds simply to a particular case of the well known relation @xmath52 in @xmath53 ) , is the analogous within the almost uni - dimensional framework to the @xmath20 relation @xmath54 ( with the first order case corresponding to @xmath55 , _",

    "it is worth noting that the fractal dimension @xmath49 is by definition the same in the presence of disorder .",
    "the dna is intrinsically a disordered system , because of the difference in the coupling energies between @xmath59 and @xmath60 base pairs . to account for disorder",
    "it is then necessary to introduce a coupling dependent on the position @xmath24 of the base pair along a given sequence , @xmath61 , writing accordingly : @xmath62 it is then important to distinguish _ thermal _ averages , @xmath63 ( over the thermal variables @xmath64 ) , from _ disorder _ averages , @xmath65 ( over the different possible realizations of the quenched random variables @xmath66 , _ i.e. _ the different possible sequences ) .",

    "such evaluations are based on the theoretical argument , that can be shown to be valid in the framework of the renormalization group approach @xcite , following which the only relevant adimensional ratio near the critical point is the one between the thermodynamic limit correlation length itself , @xmath108 , and the linear scale @xmath109 of the system under consideration ( namely in the present @xmath110 case @xmath111 ) . in a system without quenched disorder ( @xmath112 )",

    "as discussed for instance in @xcite , in the case of the diluted ising model ( a quenched disordered system which is similar to the present one , notably relative to the fact that it does not display competing interactions , and accordingly no frustration ) , an analogous scaling picture is expected to describe random critical points , and should therefore allow to evaluate the correlation length critical exponent @xmath1 , as well as the critical exponent @xmath118 related to the considered observable .",

    "this same framework also allows to infer that disorder should be relevant as soon as the specific heat critical exponent for the pure system fulfills the condition @xmath129 ( hence , from the hyper - scaling relation @xmath130 , as soon as the correlation length critical exponent of the pure system fulfills @xmath131 ) .    on the other hand ,",

    "the theoretical basis for such a possibility was laid within the renormalization group framework , notably in the case of random transverse field ising chains @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the results on the ps model with self - avoidance in @xcite , evidence for such scenario , corresponding to a pseudo first order transition , was reported in various other cases ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) .    in such context , in the case of the ps model with self - avoidance , an independently diverging correlation length could be pictured as related to the free - end distance , or , perhaps on more grounded bases , it could be hypothesized that the divergence of the typical loop is different from that of the average one .",
    "accordingly , the transition would be of first order , as in the pure case , from the point of view of the behaviour of the _ typical _ observables ( the given sequence undergoes a first order transition , with @xmath133 ) and it would be of second order from the point of view of the _ average _ ones ( whose behaviour is ruled by @xmath134 ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is also obvious within this framework @xcite , that the standard scaling law describing the finite size behaviour of a thermodynamic observable @xmath113 with critical exponent @xmath118 is expected to be better obeyed by the quantity @xmath135 : @xmath136 , \\label{scaling}\\ ] ] in which we label by @xmath137 the average over disorder performed by taking into account the sequence - dependent @xmath124 , according to : @xmath138   \\label{newaverages}\\ ] ] in such a way , one avoids that the results are governed by the fluctuations of the pseudo-@xmath0 .    finally , in the case of disorder relevance ,",

    "noticeably , these results for observables such as the order parameter and the susceptibility are expected in the present model both in the case where the mean value and the fluctuations of the pseudo - critical temperature scale with the same exponent and in the case of a pseudo first order transition .",

    "from this point of view , in @xcite two different definitions were introduced , with their study leading to the same conclusions : one is obtained from the free energy behaviour and the other , which we also study , as the crossing point of the order parameter @xmath143 curves , considering sequences of increasing lengths , obtained by the concatenation of increasing number of copies of a given original sequence .",
    "importantly , the absence of multi - step behaviour in the order parameter in @xcite , for the ps model with @xmath107 , represents the main qualitative difference with the results obtained for the on - lattice disordered saw dna or for the corresponding ps model in @xcite . indeed , to the best of our knowledge , from this point of view",
    "the present work should represent the first attempt to define a pseudo - critical temperature with the order parameter displaying a multi - step behaviour .",
    "noticeably , various definitions of the pseudo-@xmath0 have been considered , such as for spin glasses ( @xcite )    on the other hand , in @xcite the pseudo-@xmath0 was defined as the temperature corresponding to the _ unique _ maximum of the susceptibility . we are led to generalize this definition , and to take as pseudo-@xmath0 the temperature at which the susceptibility reaches its _ absolute _ maximum ( also checking the agreement of the scaling law with the alternative definition involving the concatenated sequence procedure ) .",
    "this choice , made possible by the accurately measured temperature dependence of the observables in the present study , appears generally to be the most reasonable one and it should be moreover particularly appropriate to allow the identification of a possible pseudo first order transition .",
    "in fact , when defining the pseudo-@xmath0 in this way , by applying eq .",
    "( [ newaverages ] ) one finds : @xmath144 accordingly , such definition should be effective for providing evidence for a diverging behaviour of the typical susceptibility ( hence , in the present case in which the susceptibility behaves as the specific heat , for a specific heat exponent @xmath145 , and also , by hyper - scaling in @xmath53 , for @xmath146 ) .",
    "it was further hypothesized in @xcite that the presence of two correlation lengths ruled by different critical exponents could be inferred from the probability distribution of the loop lengths .",
    "qualitatively , one would expect in particular different behaviours for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "even though such conclusion did not appear to be confirmed from the results in @xcite , with the data at @xmath149 not displaying asymptotically detectable differences , it appears desirable to further investigate this point in detail , with careful analysis of data on the whole temperature range .      for efficient numerical implementation ,",
    "the recursive equations for the forward and backward partition functions in the ps model are solved with the simex scheme ( simulations with exponentials ) , resorting to an approximation of the power law @xmath150 with a sum of exponentials . the basic idea in the simex scheme , as used in the context here @xcite , was originally expressed in @xcite , specifically for the numerical study of ps models of denaturation transitions in linear dna molecules .",
    "however , the generality of the powerful idea at the basis of this representation of the long - range effect as a sum of exponentials was not appreciated to its fair value , as in the original work @xcite it was implemented in the context of conditional probabilities specific to the model considered .",
    "the formulation of the simex proper proceeded then in two steps .",
    "first the original idea was reformulated in more general terms for the linear ps model , in the context of recursions written directly in terms of partition functions @xcite .",
    "it was then possible , on such basis , to propose generalizations of the idea to higher order models involving several mutually coupled long - range effects @xcite , with the corresponding algorithmic complexities reduced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "in order to be effective such a method relies on the accurate representation of long - range effects ( such as the probability law for the lengths of the loops , in the simplest case of the model here ) as sums of exponentials .",
    "the pad - laplace method @xcite provides an elegant generic solution to this problem , not only in the case of purely decaying functions , such as power - laws ( represented as sums of real exponentials ) , but more generally allowing to represent functions with complex exponentials . as an illustration for potential applications ,",
    "the simex scheme was used for example to implement sequence alignments with realistic gap models , in bioinformatics @xcite .    in this background , with the approximation here ,",
    "@xmath151 it is important to stress that , from the analytic point of view , replacing the power - law with exponentials is expected to change the nature of the singularity in the thermodynamic limit partition function .",
    "however , on numerical grounds , such replacement is not expected to influence the results of finite size scaling analyses .",
    "indeed , with the accuracy of the multi - exponential representation adopted ( see below ) , the numerical approximation is practically indistinguishable ( _ i.e. _ within prescribed reasonable limits ) from the analytic expression , well beyond the largest length scale considered .    in this direction , because of the importance of the underlying numerical problem , it is relevant to further recast the obtention of multi - exponential representations in the general context of approximation problems . since prony ( 1795 ) the problem of obtaining numerical representations of given functions as sums of exponentials has been addressed in many fields and contexts . as a matter of fact",
    ", this problem can be declined in two very different -in principle- flavours : identification or approximation . in the identification case the given function is supposed , by essence , to be a sum of exponentials and the problem consists in retrieving precisely the _ genuine _ number of exponential components , with the estimates of the associated parameters .",
    "this problem is reputed difficult , notably in the case of real exponentials , because of ill - conditioning .",
    "it is then easy to _ over - fit _ the data , with methods such as least - squares , with increasing number of components , thus missing the aim of proper identification of the model in terms of its original components . in the alternative case , related to approximation , the problem is of course completely different , as the given function , known analytically , is not a sum of exponentials and the aim is to obtain indeed the best possible approximation under such form .",
    "the present situation , concerning the power - law for the long - range effect , is of course relevant to the approximation case , and we need to ensure an accurate representation of the power - law up to the largest considered sizes for the system with the sum of exponentials .",
    "the number of components in the multi - exponential representation will then of course depend on the maximal size of the system considered , with the need to introduce , according to this size , additional components with increasingly smaller @xmath152 parameters ( see eq .",
    "( [ exprap ] ) ) : in the numerical fit , for increasingly larger values of the variable @xmath57 , close to the maximal one in the model , the exponential components with the smallest @xmath152 parameters are required to decay according to the corresponding values of the power - law .    in such context",
    ", the pad - laplace method ( which encompasses various other formulations such as the prony method or the method of moments as particular cases ) was originally formulated for the identification problem .",
    "it was however also used in the approximation context , for the obtention of numerical approximations of the power - law with sums of exponentials ( see with this respect [ fig .",
    "4 ] in reference @xcite ) . interestingly , in such case , an _ identification - like _ behaviour was observed , concerning the number of exponential components in the representation : more precisely , it was observed that the number of components appropriate for systems of size @xmath153 followed essentially a law in @xmath154 ( 10 components for @xmath153 up to @xmath155 , 14 - 15 components for @xmath153 up to @xmath156 , such as in the genomic analyses @xcite ) . of course",
    ", within the approximation context , the original model for the multi - exponential representation as obtained by the identification procedure can be further used as _ initial guess _ for least - square fits , for further refined approximation . in various studies , including in the original fixman - freire paper @xcite , multi - exponential representations for the power - law were obtained resorting to different methods .",
    "it is however interesting to notice that increasingly more complex models implemented in the context of the generalizations of the simex , could involve non purely decaying general long - range effects . in such case",
    "it would then be necessary to resort to approximations with sums of general complex exponentials , as allowed by the pad - laplace method @xcite .",

    "we first notice , comparing the behaviours in [ fig .",
    "[ rev_new_fig2]a ] and [ fig . [ rev_new_fig2]b ] , that the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath124 , defined as the temperature at which the susceptibility reaches its absolute maximum , is very close to the corresponding one obtained from the specific heat plot .",
    "this conclusion holds independently of the choice of a specific sequence .",
    "in fact , as already observed in @xcite , for the parameter values used ( notably ratio @xmath69 , between energies associated with @xmath60 and @xmath59 links ) , for each disordered configuration , the specific heat , the derivative with respect to temperature of the order parameter and the susceptibility always display very similar behaviours . in particular , as detailed below , it appears that the disorder averages of specific heat and of susceptibility ( referring either to standard averages @xmath175 or to averages which take into account the sequence - dependent pseudo - critical temperature @xmath137 ) display the same critical behaviour at @xmath0 and the same kind of finite size corrections to scaling .",
    "interestingly , despite the multi - step behaviour , we observe in [ fig .",
    "[ rev_new_fig1 ] ] that the densities of closed base pairs @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively , cross at a well defined @xmath179-value , thus providing , following @xcite , a different possibility for defining a pseudo - critical temperature @xmath180 , which we also study here .",
    "it appears reasonable to assume that the scaling properties of this observable should not depend on the particular way it is defined .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no previous attempts for defining and studying in detail pseudo - critical temperatures in the presence of several distinct peaks in the specific heat or in the susceptibility and our definition of @xmath124 as the position of the absolute maximum of the susceptibility appears reasonable in such case . in any event , in the present work , we checked that with our choice we get results compatible with those obtained with the alternative definition above , for chain lengths up to @xmath170 .",
    "moreover , checking the behaviour of the order parameters for sequences obtained by concatenation of @xmath181 copies of the original sequence , we can observe in [ fig .",
    "[ rev_new_fig1 ] ] that the multi - step behaviour becomes less evident for increasing chain lengths .",

    "[ rev_new_fig4 ] ] , the evaluations of the susceptibility for different possible instances of sequences of increasing lengths , involving the original sequence of length @xmath170 , for which this observable displays three distinct peaks . in detail : in [ fig .",

    ", these findings also clearly confirm qualitatively that the thermodynamic limit behaviour of the model is described by a single correlation length , in agreement with the result following which the mean value and the fluctuations of the pseudo-@xmath0 scale with the same exponent ( namely , @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that in our previous work @xcite , by fitting the data for the maximum of the specific heat ( averaged in the standard way ) to the law @xmath229 , we obtained ( with the first two points disregarded ) @xmath230 , and hence @xmath4 .",
    "hence , it would be meaningless to repeat the analysis on @xmath231 here .",
    "inasmuch as the data the data for @xmath232 display an abrupt change as function of @xmath88 , it is all the more appropriate to introduce a crossover chain length @xmath3 , for characterizing the slow approach of the model to the asymptotic regime .",

    "indeed , intuitively enough , since the single sequence order parameter displays multi - step behaviour in a significant fraction of the samples , the sequence - to - sequence fluctuations of this observable , averaged in the standard way , should play a role at least of the same importance than in the model studied with @xmath107 in @xcite , in which this behaviour is not observed .    in this background",

    "[ rev_new_fig8 ] ] display rather irregular behaviours in the whole high-@xmath179 region , even though it is in general expected that @xmath239 both above and below the critical point .",
    "this observation can be explained by the fact that here the disorder couples only to the low - temperature phase , with the order parameter being zero in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath45 , where the two dna strands are only linked at the origin .",

    "the behaviour of these quantities for @xmath250 , as shown in @xcite , was instead found compatible with a smooth transition , but it is noticeable that the evaluated critical exponent @xmath99 appears to depend on @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , such dependency is more evident when considering the average quantity @xmath251 , further displaying more important deviations from the expected behaviour ( @xmath252 ) than @xmath248 .    in summary ,",
    "the analysis of the data in @xcite suggested the asymptotic condition @xmath253 , which is confirmed by our present evaluation @xmath254 obtained from the pseudo-@xmath0 behaviour .",
    "nevertheless , to further clarify the situation , attempting to better characterize the finite size behaviour of the present model , we are led to study in detail both @xmath251 and @xmath248 on the whole relevant @xmath179-range , by introducing effective ( @xmath88-dependent ) critical exponents @xmath255 and @xmath256 , as well as correlation lengths @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",

    "this conclusion also holds for the analysis of @xmath249 data , even though involving in this case more significant corrections .",
    "it is also very illustrative to notice that limiting the analysis to chain lengths @xmath275 can lead to interpretations significantly different from those obtained considering the long chain length regime : one would get from [ fig .",
    "[ rev_new_fig9]b ] an estimate for @xmath266 essentially compatible with the zero value characteristic of the pure case ( _ i.e. _ @xmath276 which would imply @xmath277 ) , as well as ( from [ fig . [ rev_new_fig9]a ] ) an estimate for @xmath256 not significantly larger than 1.5 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath278 with @xmath134 ) . with this respect , the analysis here confirms , that in the regime below the crossover chain length @xmath3 , it is difficult to extrapolate the correct thermodynamic limit behaviour on general grounds , with the results being indeed interpretable in such context according to the picture implying a pseudo first order phase transition as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the importance of finite size effects is further highlighted in [ fig .",
    "[ rev_new_fig10 ] ] .",
    "this figure allows to compare the behaviour of @xmath268 ( [ fig .",

    "it can be also observed that , in the same short chain length regime , for the average performed after taking the logarithm , negative ( physically meaningless ) values are obtained for @xmath283 on a large part of the @xmath179-range ( bearing in mind that in this case it appears necessary to insert also a quadratic term in @xmath57 in order to perform the data fit ) . even though the data here do not allow a more quantitative analysis",
    ", these results further imply that below the crossover ( _ i.e. _ for chain lengths @xmath284 ) evidence is observed for the presence of two correlation lengths ( and accordingly for two different critical exponents @xmath285 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the behaviours of @xmath286 and @xmath287 for @xmath288 are in agreement over a large @xmath179-range , within the error margins , with a correlation length exponent @xmath280 , as clearly shown in [ fig .",

    "the fact that the two quantities converge towards the same behaviour is particularly meaningful : these observables are very demanding to be measured , and moreover they are the ones expected to be the most affected by corrections to scaling . therefore , the result confirms that for @xmath289 the asymptotic regime of the model considered is definitely reached .    finally , for the different chain lengths , [ fig .",

    "( [ newaverages ] ) .",
    "more precisely , in this case , for any given sequence , the loop - length probability distribution which contributes to the average is the one evaluated at the @xmath292 , where the susceptibility of the sequence reaches its absolute maximum . upon comparing these plots to those of @xmath293 and @xmath294 in @xcite ( respectively [ fig .",
    "6 ] and [ fig . 9 ]",
    ", in this reference ) , it becomes once more clear that the analysis in terms of pseudo - critical temperatures allows to reduce the importance of finite size corrections to scaling .",
    "this can be seen first of all in the fact that here data corresponding to average after taking the logarithm display a behaviour more similar to the one in which the logarithm is taken after the average .",
    "moreover both quantities approach qualitatively more rapidly the asymptotic behaviour @xmath295 , with @xmath273 , in the present case .      on general grounds ,",
    "the rounding of the transition due to disorder in the present model should be mainly attributable to the presence of _ rare regions _ in the sequences ( as expected in particular from the theoretical results @xcite ) , or otherwise stated to the importance of the _ atypical events _ @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we attempt to quantify roughly their contribution in the finite size behaviour of the system , to better understand the way in which relevance of disorder becomes manifest , starting from the finite size level .",
    "this approach relies on the numerical evaluation here of @xmath3 for the particular model considered , as well as on the previously proposed very simplified phenomenological picture @xcite .    qualitatively speaking",
    ", the approach is expected to be meaningful in the present case with @xmath16 , corresponding to a first order transition in the pure model .",
    "indeed , from the finite size behaviour point of view , this model appears to be characterized in general by a slow approach to the asymptotic regime , and the evidence for the effect of disorder ( leading to the predicted smooth transition described by a single correlation length ) appears to be related to the quite sudden appearance , at @xmath296 , of enhanced ( with respect to the @xmath297 case ) multi - step behaviours in the order parameter ( and accordingly of different peaks in the susceptibility ) in a significant fraction of the sequences considered .",
    "this feature can then be expected to be related to the presence in such sequences of _ large enough rare regions _ , which would then be already occurring , at @xmath296 , with not negligible probability .",
    "it is worth recalling that in @xcite we showed notably that the relevant quantity from this point of view is expected to be the adimensional ratio between the rare region length @xmath109 ( _ i.e. _ the number of consecutive base pairs of the same kind ) and the value of the parameter : @xmath298 in the particular model _",
    " la _ ps with @xmath299 considered .",
    "this quantity is therefore to be interpreted as a measure of the _ effective _ disorder strength , linking the concept of large enough rare region to the values of @xmath68 and @xmath300 in the model .",
    "accordingly , we are led to the combinatorial problem of evaluating the probability @xmath301 to observe , in a sequence of total length @xmath88 , a subsequence of consecutive base pairs of the same kind of length at least @xmath109 .",
    "such evaluation could appear to be rather simple .",
    "however even the obtention of the exact solution for the binomial quenched disordered variables distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ disorderprobability ] ) appears to be far from trivial , and we resort here to the approximation : @xmath302 this approximation is exact for @xmath125 , but clearly invalid for small @xmath109 values , leading to probabilities higher than 1 . nonetheless , it can be considered that this approximation provides a reasonable basis for the present analysis , as we are mainly interested to capture the order of magnitude of the quantity ( we checked numerically , by exact computations , that this is roughly the case , in a large @xmath109 range , already for small @xmath88 values ) .",
    "as already outlined above , at the crossover it is expected to find large enough rare regions with a non - negligible probability . here",
    "we set this probability to the value @xmath303 , based on the observation that the order parameter displays multi - step behaviour at @xmath296 ( _ i.e. _ multi - peak behaviour of the susceptibility ) in a fraction of order @xmath304 of the sequences considered .",
    "accordingly , by applying eq .",
    "( [ pnl ] ) with @xmath305 ( hence finding numerically the solution @xmath306 of @xmath307 ) , we get an estimation of the crossover rare region length @xmath308 , in correspondence with the crossover chain length @xmath309 which characterizes the present model . assuming that the phenomenological picture does indeed capture the basic physics of the problem , and recalling that one has @xmath310 in the present case ,",
    "it is now in general easy to predict the behaviours of @xmath311 and of the corresponding crossover chain length @xmath312 as functions of the parameter @xmath313 in models _  la _ ps for dna denaturation transition with @xmath107 . in fact , in order for the effect of disorder to be equally manifest in different models , it is expected to be necessary for the underlying ratio values @xmath314 ( of the crossover rare region length to the parameter @xmath313 ) to be similar @xcite .",
    "such conditions can be expressed as @xmath315 . by using @xmath316 with @xmath317 ,",
    "it is then possible to obtain @xmath318 by solving once again eq .",
    "( [ pnl ] ) with @xmath305 .    in this way , for the ps model with @xmath107 in @xcite",
    ", we find extremely large @xmath3 values of order @xmath319 . indeed , the link energies and the connectivity constant used in @xcite ( which we recalled in [ tab .",
    "3 ] ) lead to @xmath320 . taking also into account the somehow different law for the allowed coupling adopted in that study ,",
    "the effective value of the parameter @xmath321 is in fact expected to be still larger . even though relying on rough evaluations , it appears therefore reasonable to consider that with the conditions in @xcite it would be impossible , in practice , to reach the asymptotic regime .",
    "in such context , the ps model with @xmath107 in @xcite is in fact indeed expected to behave in agreement with a pseudo first order transition , ruled by two correlation lengths ( corresponding to typical and average quantities ; namely with @xmath277 and @xmath134 ) , independently from the observable considered and even well beyond the ( already extremely large ) chain lengths studied ( up to @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus , in the context of the analysis above , it appears possible to reconcile the two different pictures emerging from the previous numerical studies @xcite .",
    "further , in such context , the scenario associated with the pseudo first order transition appears meaningful to describe the finite-@xmath88 behaviour in the presence of _ weak _ disorder . in this case",
    ", it would be moreover interesting to clarify the importance of boundary conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ whether the second correlation length is better interpreted as the one related to the free - end distance or to an average loop length , with in fact the results here concerning the loop - length probability distribution favouring the second alternative .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the @xmath322 of the present model , which pertains to the region associated with large finite size effects ( yet possible to study ) , is definitely closer to the still _ smaller _ @xmath323 associated with the values of the coupling energies and of @xmath300 typically adopted for comparisons with experimental melting curves . in detail , the value of @xmath103 adopted for comparison with experiments is essentially the same ( @xmath324 ) than the one in @xcite , with , however , underlying link energies more than an order of magnitude smaller and a @xmath300 value more than an order of magnitude larger .",
    "the simple approximation of @xmath325 considered may not be sufficient for precise predictions of @xmath326 and @xmath327 values .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to expect crossover rare region length of the order of a few base pairs , and a corresponding relatively small crossover chain length . from this point of view",
    ", the present results on the studied ps model with @xmath107 suggest that both self - avoidance and disorder could play a key role in experimental dna behaviour .",
    "nevertheless , apart from the possible effect of neglecting correlations in the sequences , which are well known to be present in dna molecules , a throughout understanding of this phenomenon would also require to better clarify the role of the cooperativity factor @xmath328 in ps models .",
    "indeed , in order to reproduce correctly the experimental curves , usually very small values , @xmath329 , are adopted for this parameter ( see in particular @xcite )",
    ". it would be also meaningful to further characterize the influence of this parameter , of non - universal character , on the finite size behaviour of the system ( corresponding roughly to the introduction of an additional correlation length @xmath330 ) .",
    "we performed an extensive numerical analysis of a disordered ps model with @xmath107 , hence with the loop - length probability distribution exponent of the pure system taking completely into account self - avoidance .",
    "the analyses are following two main directions : i ) a finite size scaling study in terms of appropriately defined pseudo - critical temperatures and ii ) an attempt to characterize the peculiar finite size behaviour of the model .    completing previous numerical results @xcite , and in agreement with the predictions based on a probabilistic mathematical approach @xcite",
    ", the present work notably provides evidence that the thermodynamic limit behaviour of the model is coherent with the picture describing random ferromagnets @xcite : a smooth transition described by a single correlation length ( with the refined estimation here for the corresponding critical exponent @xmath2 ) .    the pseudo - critical temperature itself , that we define for taking appropriately into account the possible presence of multiple steps in the order parameter for a given sequence ( checking its compatibility with a different definition suggested in @xcite for the same model ) appears to be a particularly interesting observable to study . in detail , we find that the mean value and the fluctuations of this pseudo - critical temperature agree",
    "well with the expected scaling laws in the typical scenario corresponding to disorder relevance . and",
    "accordingly , the two quantities appear to be ruled by the same critical exponent ( the one corresponding to the correlation length ) , on the whole @xmath88-range considered , without displaying the strong corrections to scaling observed in other quantities .    on this basis , it is also interesting to notice that the refined estimation of @xmath1 obtained with this analysis is further compatible with the estimation @xmath331 given in @xcite , for a ps model with the different @xmath332 . therefore , the results here could also support the hypothesis that the random ps model critical behaviour is independent on the @xmath6 value , as soon as the pure ps model undergoes a transition characterized by a diverging specific heat .    from this point of view",
    ", it can be nevertheless noticed that we focused here on the simplest possible scaling picture , therefore that the present study does not rule out the possibility that the complete description of the random system could involve more than a single independent critical exponent . in such case , it could be possible to get a scaling law obeyed by the order parameter and a better scaling of the loop - length probability distribution at @xmath333 .",
    "however such possibility , whose exploration would represent a new subject , would clearly not impact the present result on @xmath1 , and it is not expected to impact neither the present results on the characterization of the finite size behaviour .",
    "moreover , in any event , the observation that in the present model the order parameter behaves as the energy , and the susceptibility as the specific heat , could be relevant only for the disordered regime considered .",
    "more specifically , we did not investigate here the _ strong _ disorder regime of the model .",
    "indeed , for @xmath334 , the observed behaviour could be more complex , since models _  la _ ps are expected to display an additional singularity of the kosterlitz - thouless kind @xcite .",
    "the present analysis also shows qualitatively that the finite size corrections are in general smaller when quantities are averaged taking into account the pseudo - critical temperatures .",
    "finally , based on the study of an appropriately defined non self - averageness parameter , evidence is provided that the susceptibility is a strongly non self - averaging quantity at the critical point , with its detailed behaviour further allowing to get an alternative evaluation of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , compatible with our previous ones .    in this background , mainly in the second part of the work , we seek a better understanding of finite size effects .",
    "the data for the maximum of the susceptibility , and even more so the detailed study of the behaviour of the loop - length probability distribution , give weight to the existence of a crossover chain length @xmath3 below which one could not rule out the picture proposed in @xcite .",
    "this alternative scenario , the pseudo first order phase transition one , is indeed found to capture the behaviour of a different ps model with the same @xmath107 up to the extremely large sizes of @xmath335 . in detail , we present a qualitative evaluation from below of @xmath336 from data on the pseudo-@xmath0 , and a more quantitative evaluation from above of @xmath337 from data on the loop - length probability distribution .",
    "we also provide a tentative quantification of the dependence of @xmath3 on the parameters of the model , with notably an evaluation of the crossover length behaviour which could allow to reconcile the results here with those in @xcite : with the parameters chosen for the model in @xcite it could be not possible to reach the asymptotic regime in practice . in this context",
    ", we also find that the crossover chain length obtained for realistic parameter values ( as used in experimental settings ) should be definitely smaller than the present @xmath3 and , accordingly , our conclusions , concerning both the importance of self - avoidance and the relevance of disorder , should be also important for better modeling experimental dna denaturation .",
    "it is finally also interesting to stress that these extensive studies of the finite size behaviour , particularly in the case of ps models for dna denaturation transitions , were made possible thanks to the recursive equations for the partition functions ( notably within the simex scheme ) , reducing essentially the time complexity of the problem to @xmath338 .    in conclusion , it is possible that crossover effects , such as those described here , could be relevant in a larger class of disordered systems ( at least in the behaviour of certain observables ) , allowing a better understanding of the finite size behaviour , and in particular of the way in which relevance of disorder becomes manifest when approaching the thermodynamic limit . in this sense",
    "the results and treatments here could provide interesting insights for the exploration of such disordered systems , on more general grounds . on the biological side",
    ", the results here should also contribute to a better understanding of the roles played by disorder and self - avoidance in experimental dna denaturation , with notably a quantitative description of the finite size effect particularly important in this context .",
