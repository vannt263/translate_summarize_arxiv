    "classical electrodynamics in vacuum is a linear theory and does not foresee photon - photon scattering or other non linear effects between electromagnetic fields . before quantum electrodynamics ( qed )",
    "was formally complete , euler and heisenberg , and weisskopf , realized that vacuum fluctuations , permitted by the uncertainty principle , lead to non linear effects : 4 photons can couple via fermion loops .",
    "such non linear effects were first calculated in 1936 @xcite and can be described by an effective lagrangian @xmath14 which , for field strengths well below their critical values ( @xmath15  t , @xmath16  v / m ) and for photon energies below the electron mass , can be written as ( in s.i .",
    "units ) : @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath8 describing the non linearity is @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the compton wavelength of the electron , @xmath20 the fine structure constant , @xmath21 the electron mass , @xmath22 the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath23 the magnetic permeability of vacuum .",
    "maxwell s equations are still valid provided the constitutive equations are applied to the total lagrangian density @xmath24 to derive the displacement vector @xmath25 and the magnetic field intensity vector @xmath26 @xmath27    one of the yet to be measured effects predicted by the @xmath14 correction is that vacuum will become birefringent in the presence of an external magnetic and/or electric field .",
    "for example , in the case of a beam propagating perpendicularly to an external magnetic field , if @xmath28 and @xmath29 indicate the index of refraction for polarizations respectively parallel and perpendicular to the field direction , the birefringence can be expressed as @xcite @xmath30 which is extremely small : with a field intensity of 5  t , @xmath31 .",
    "another process described by the same feynman diagrams as magnetically induced vacuum birefringence is photon - photon scattering .",
    "figure [ diag ] shows the feynman diagrams for both photon - photon scattering and field induced vacuum birefringence .        in general ,",
    "the connection between the index of refraction @xmath32 of a medium and the photon scattering amplitude in the forward direction for photons with energy @xmath33 , @xmath34 , is ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the average number density of centers of scattering and @xmath37 is the photon wave number . applied to photon - photon scattering of linearly polarized photons , the center of mass forward scattering amplitude of ingoing and outgoing photons all having parallel polarizations , @xmath38 , and the one in which the two incoming photons have perpendicular polarizations as do the ougoing photons , @xmath39 are , respectively @xcite @xmath40 where it is apparent that the scattering amplitude is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the authors of @xcite also show that @xmath36 is proportional to the energy density of the scatterer field ( electric and/or magnetic ) and inversely proportional to the photon energy in the center of mass reference frame . from the scattering amplitude one can find the differential cross section @xmath41 and the total cross section which depends on @xmath42 . for unpolarized light one finds @xcite @xmath43 the connection between the total photon - photon cross section and vacuum birefringence , hence the parameter @xmath8 describing non linear qed effects , makes non linear qed searches via ellipsometric techniques very attractive .",
    "limits on @xmath8 from ellipsometric data can therefore be directly translated into photon - photon scattering limits .",
    "it is interesting to note that in a post - maxwellian framework @xcite the lagrangian density @xmath44 describing nonlinear electrodynamic effects in vacuum is parameterized by three parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 \\label{lpm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this parameterization @xmath49 , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are dimensionless parameters depending on the chosen model . in the euler - heisenberg electrodynamics @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51 being the fine structure constant .    by substituting the post - maxwellian generalization into equations ( [ constitutive ] )",
    "one finds that the birefringence induced by a transverse magnetic field is ( to be compared with equation ( [ birifqed ] ) ) @xmath52 whereas the forward scattering amplitudes given in expressions ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) become @xmath53 birefringence is therefore only sensitive to the difference @xmath54 whereas the two forward scattering amplitudes @xmath55 and @xmath56 are proportional respectively to @xmath46 and @xmath47 . at scattering angles different from @xmath57",
    "it remains true that @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath46 but @xmath59 will now depend on a combination of @xmath46 and @xmath47 which never cancels .",
    "therefore , for example , in the born - infeld model @xcite where @xmath60 , magnetically induced birefringence is not expected even though photon - photon scattering is .",
    "although very promising for detecting nonlinear electrodynamic effects , the ellipsometric technique alone it is not sufficient to determine the two independent quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 . on the other hand direct photon - photon scattering with defined polarization states",
    "it is clear how both techniques are complementary .",
    "assuming the euler - heisenberg lagrangian density , in this paper we will present the best limits on @xmath63 at low energy available today .",
    "the general scheme of a sensitive ellipsometer searching for magnetically induced birefringence is presented in figure [ schemepvlas ] .",
    "a polarizer defines the polarization of the beam , of power @xmath64 , before it enters the magnetic field region where it acquires an ellipticity @xmath65 .",
    "the ellipticity is made time dependent by modulating the magnetic field with angular frequency @xmath66 ( see text below ) .",
    "two mirrors compose either a multi - pass or a fabry - perot cavity to increase the optical path within the magnetic field region .",
    "the beam then passes first through a modulator , where it acquires a known ellipticity @xmath67 modulated at frequency @xmath68 , and then through an analyzer .",
    "the transmitted power @xmath69 is then detected and analysed .",
    "for the purpose of our discussion let a laser beam propagate along the @xmath70 axis and let the incoming ( linear ) polarization define the @xmath71 axis ( figure [ sistrif ] ) .",
    "considering the coherence of our light source , the jones matrix formalism will be used .",
    "the jones matrix for a uniaxial birefringent element is given by        @xmath72    where @xmath73 represents the angle between the slow axis ( @xmath74 ) of the medium and the @xmath71 axis and @xmath75 is the induced ellipticity acquired by the light , given by @xmath76 with @xmath77 the phase delay between the parallel and perpendicular polarization components acquired in a length @xmath78 .    given an input beam whose electric field",
    "after the entrance polarizer is @xmath79 the electric field after the birefringent medium will be @xmath80 assuming no losses , the power @xmath69 after the analyzer ( polarizer crossed with respect to the entrance polarizer ) will therefore be @xmath81    the power is proportional to @xmath82 and , whether @xmath73 is constant in time or not , results in an unmeasurably small intensity component .    to linearize the term proportional to the ellipticity signal @xmath65 to be detected , one can add a known time varying ellipticity @xmath83 using an ellipticity modulator .",
    "the jones matrix for the modulator is the same as @xmath84 set at an angle of @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) : @xmath87 and the resulting vector describing the electric field after the modulator will be @xmath88 neglecting second order terms , the power @xmath69 after the analyzer will be @xmath89\\ ] ] which now depends linearly on the ellipticity @xmath65 . to complete the discussion",
    ", one finds experimentally that static and slowly varying ellipticities , in the following indicated as @xmath90 , are always present in an actual apparatus and that two crossed polarizers have an intrinsic extinction ratio @xmath91 , mainly due to imperfections in the crystals they are made of .",
    "furthermore , losses in the system reduce the total light reaching the analyzer . therefore , taking into account an additional spurious ellipticity term @xmath90 ( since @xmath92 these terms commute and therefore add up algebraically ) and a term proportional to @xmath91 , the total power at the output of the analyzer will be @xmath93\\simeq\\\\ & \\simeq&i_{0}\\left[\\sigma^2+\\zeta(t)^2+\\alpha(t)^{2}+2\\zeta(t)\\psi\\sin2\\vartheta+2\\zeta(t)\\alpha(t)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 represents the power of light reaching the analyser .    to be able to distinguish the term @xmath95 , which is usually largest at low frequencies , from the term @xmath96 , the term of interest @xmath97 is also made to vary in time .",
    "this can be done by either ramping the magnetic field intensity ( varying therefore @xmath65 ) or by rotating the magnetic field direction ( varying @xmath73 ) .",
    "the final expression , explicitly indicating the time dependence of @xmath65 and @xmath73 , for the power at the output of the analyzer is therefore @xmath98 \\label{spurious}\\ ] ]      to further increase the ellipticity induced by the birefringent region one can increase the number of passes through it . either a multi - pass cavity or a fabry - perot cavity can be used for this purpose . in the pvlas experiment described below",
    ", a fabry - perot has been chosen . in a multi - pass cavity",
    "the induced ellipticity is proportional to the number of passes @xmath99 through the region . with a fabry - perot cavity",

    "the magnetic field is provided by a superconducting dipole magnet which is placed vertically and rotates around its axis , at a typical frequency of 0.3 hz . the magnetic field therefore lies in the horizontal plane , the field region is 1 m long , and the maximum field intensity is 5.5 t. the ellipsometer develops vertically : polarizer and entrance cavity mirror are supported by the lower optical bench , whereas output cavity mirror , modulator and analyzer are in a vacuum chamber on the upper optical bench .",
    "the lower optical bench is in a pit whose floor is a concrete slab resting on four 14 m long pillars buried in the ground .",
