    "there are many well - established theories to describe open quantum many - particle systems consisting of , e.g. ,  quasi - free charge carriers in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite , cavity photons  @xcite , phonons  @xcite , ultracold bose - gases  @xcite , polaritons  @xcite , and spins  @xcite in an approximate way .",
    "the theories in the preceding references are related to mean - field theories and its successive improvements , like the cluster expansion  @xcite ( ce ) , in which equations of motion ( eom ) for the mean single - particle occupations and their correlations are derived , whereas higher - order correlations are neglected .",
    "besides the approximations that are necessary to describe the interacting system itself , many of the referenced models also require additional approximations to include dissipative processes resulting from the systems coupling to an external bath .",
    "the von neumann lindblad equation is a common procedure to take the influence of the exterior bath on the system into account @xcite , provided that the born - markov - approximation is justified@xcite .",
    "the experimental progress in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics in semiconductors @xcite shows that there are many interesting systems in which the basic assumption of mean field theories , a large hilbert space and weak interaction , is not valid .",
    "many of these systems are sufficiently small to be described by their exact wave function or density matrix , formulated in the hilbert space of all possible many - particle configurations @xcite without the need for an approximate theory . despite the efforts that are made to improve the theories from both sides ( exact description of relatively small systems @xcite and approximate description of relatively large systems @xcite ) ,",
    "there is still a gap between those systems that are small enough to be described exactly and those that are large enough to fulfill the requirements of approximate theories like the ce .    in this article",
    ", we describe pitfalls in the choice of the basis states that may occur , when applying approximate theories on small systems within or close to the mentioned gap .",
    "we use three examples to contrast approaches that are based on a formulation in single - particle states with approaches that use many - particle configuration states as a basis .",
    "although the formulations are equivalent , the choice of basis states can decide about further steps . in our three examples , we show that the choice of basis states can suggest misleading approximations or determine the modeling of dissipative processes , which leads to deviations of the results , in the two formulations that go beyond simple approximation errors .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ sec : issue ] , we discuss , based on an extended jaynes - cummings model @xcite ( jcm ) , the effects of a fallacious mean - field factorization scheme , implied by a description in single - particle states .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : lt ] , we consider an open system treated in the von neumann lindblad ( vnl ) formalism .",
    "we demonstrate that the basis states in which the collapse operators and with it the dissipator of the vnl equation are constructed can actually influence the modeling of the system . in the first example concerning the vnl ( sec .",
    "[ ssec : hole ] ) , the choice of basis states limits the possibilities to adjust the model to the experimental situation . whereas , in the second example concerning the vnl formalism ( sec .",
    "[ ssec : ssd ] ) , the basis states determine whether two parts of the system are affected by the environment independently or intertwined and one system part is dephased by the dissipative decay of the other .",
    "finally we recapitulate how the dissipator in the vnl can be constructed from a system plus reservoir approach@xcite and resolve the misconception , that has led to results depending on the choice of basis states ( sec .  [ ssec.sytempres ] ) .",
    "the last section [ sec : last ] summarizes and concludes the paper . in the appendix , we give details of the eom and the parameter space of the semiconductor jcm ( app .",

    "[ app : deph ] ) , and present the effects of an additional external pump on the open system ( app .",
    "[ app : pump ] ) .",
    "to illustrate a conceptual problem that can arise from a hartree - fock - like factorization of expectation values , we consider a model with jaynes - cummings interaction , introduced in @xcite , with the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 annihilates ( creates ) a cavity mode photon with frequency @xmath2 and @xmath3 annihilates ( creates ) an electron / hole , with energy @xmath4 , respectively .",

    "this hamiltonian describes a two - level quantum dot ( qd ) embedded in a semiconductor environment , coupled to a single cavity mode .",
    "it would be identical to the jcm , if one restricts the electronic states to fully correlated electrons and holes , i.e. ,  restricting the electronic states to a single exciton ( electron - hole pair ) .",
    "however , in order to describe the semiconductor properties of a qd , an independent occupation of the electron and hole states is allowed in this model , which we term the semiconductor jcm .",
    "both systems perform a coherent exchange between the cavity photons and the exciton , called rabi oscillations @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the time evolution using eom for the expectation values produces a hierarchy of coupled equations .",
    "we will show that a factorization of many - particle expectation values into single - particle expectation values , often used to truncate hierarchies of eom , is not only unnecessary in this exemplary model , but also leads to conceptually wrong conclusions .    to derive the eom , we follow the approach of @xcite , in which the photons are not described by creation and annihilation operators , but by the photon probability distribution .",
    "this allows for a variant of the ce in which the photonic part is treated exactly , and is termed the photon probability ce by the authors of @xcite .",
    "the expectation values of interest are the hole @xmath7 and the electron @xmath8 occupation , the occupation of the fock - states with @xmath9 photons @xmath10 , and the imaginary part of the photon - assisted polarization . from the heisenberg equation for the generalized occupations @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13",

    "one can avoid problems and misconceptions like this by describing the finite states of the carriers localized in the qd in the basis of its many - particle configurations as we have demonstrated here .",
