    "graphs on surfaces have a wide range of applications in mathematics . in particular , the notion of a bipartite graph in which we have a cyclic ordering at each vertex proves surprisingly powerful .",

    "while much is known about congruence subgroups , since one can describe them in terms of congruences on the entries of the matrices , noncongruence subgroups are more mysterious .",
    "however , the correspondence between groups and graphs does not discriminate between congruence and noncongruence , so the graphs give a hands - on way to work with both .",
    "there are several existing tests and criteria for a subgroup of @xmath4 to be congruence , such as those due to hsu @xcite and larcher @xcite . in section [ gamma1_drawings ]",

    "we introduce the notion of a @xmath1-tiling .",
    "this tool will allow us to produce generators for @xmath0 corresponding to a specific graph in terms of the standard generators for @xmath1 .",
    "it will also allow us to give a method by which to determine if one group contains another , given the graph for the large group and generators for the smaller one in terms of the generators for @xmath1 , by determining if the corresponding graphs cover one another .",
    "thus , given generators for @xmath2 , we can determine whether or not a graph of level @xmath3 corresponds to a congruence subgroup by determining if the graph for @xmath2 covers the graph for @xmath0 .",

    "we say a face _ contains _ an edge if the label for that edge is inside the face , and the _ degree _ of a face is the number of edges it contains .",

    "the arc from 0 to 1 will represent an edge ; we use dashed lines between white vertices and corresponding face centers . in this way",

    "we glue the domain to form a surface by finding side - pairing transformations .",
    "for example , the sides marked @xmath58 are identified by the element @xmath59 of @xmath0 .",

    "we can first find a fundamental domain which corresponds to the graph .",
    "then we find the side - pairing transformations , which generate the group .",
    "( see ford @xcite , theorem 19 in section 28 or theorem 10 in section 32 ) .    for examples we look at the graphs in figure [ fig : first_graph_examples ] .",

    "the cycle for the black vertex , @xmath37 determines our edge pairings .",
    "we can verify that with these pairings the cusps at 0 , 2 , 4 and 8 are all identified to form the black vertex in graph ( b ) , and that rotating around the white vertices we see the cycles @xmath39 .",
    "the side - pairing transformations give us generators of the corresponding group @xmath67 .",
    "we have six generators : one for each edge , and also @xmath68 , which identifies the vertical arcs .",

    "after edge 3 we expect edge 4 , so we identify the arc from 0 to @xmath76 with the arc from 4 to 5 , which adjoins the tile @xmath63 .",
    "we continue to pair edges and solve for the corresponding generators to get the group @xmath77    the correspondence inspires the following terminology :    [ define_graph_domain ] by a _ ( fundamental ) domain of a graph _",

    "the cusp width of @xmath20 is 2 , which is the width of its fundamental domain at @xmath20 ; the degree of the face in the graph for @xmath1 is 1 . in the graph for a group @xmath21",

    "the least common multiple of the cusp widths is the least common multiple of twice each degree , and thus twice the least common multiple of the degrees .",
    "wohlfahrt then proves that for a group @xmath0 of level @xmath11 in his sense , @xmath0 is congruence if and only if @xmath0 contains @xmath9 , and so for congruence subgroups the two definitions agree .",
    "thus , in order to check if a group of level @xmath11 is congruence , we need check only whether it contains @xmath9 for this particular value of @xmath11 .",
    "the idea of looking at subgroups of @xmath81 in terms of drawings is not new .",
    "however , for the most part these versions of drawings differ from the graphs we have used .",
    "this arises from the fact that others are looking at subgroups of @xmath82 which are not necessarily in @xmath1 . in this section",
    "we explain the relationship between the two types of drawings and the advantages of working with each .    in figure [",
    "fig : domain_gamma2_graph ] we showed how @xmath18 , the fundamental domain of @xmath1 , can be interpreted as a graph : the arc from 0 to 1 represents an edge , and the cusps at 0 , 1 and @xmath20 represent a black vertex , white vertex , and face center , respectively . for subgroups of @xmath1 ,",
    "the domains consisting of @xmath11 copies of @xmath18 correspond to graphs with @xmath11 edges .",

    "the natural way to associate a graph to this group is to mark the point @xmath84 with a black vertex , @xmath83 with a white vertex , and continue to mark the cusp @xmath20 with a @xmath54 to represent a face center .    because @xmath85=6 $ ]",
    ", we find a new way to draw a graph for @xmath1 : we lift the graph for @xmath4 to the tiling of a fundamental domain for @xmath1 by six copies of our domain for @xmath4 as in figure [ fig : gamma2_by_gamma1_graph ]",
    ". we can extend this for general graphs .",
    "for this section we will distinguish these by referring to the _ @xmath4-graph _ and the _ @xmath1-graph _",
    ", respectively , associated to group @xmath0 .",
    "notice that in the @xmath4-graph the black vertices all have degree either 1 or 3 , and the white vertices have degree 1 or 2 .    by computing a few examples one can begin to find the pattern in converting from a @xmath1-graph to a @xmath4-graph . in the domains for the graphs for @xmath1",
    "the vertices and face centers are all labeled at cusps , so when converting , every black vertex , white vertex and face center will appear as the center of a face on the new graph . as a way to get started , we can notice in figure [ fig : gamma2_by_gamma1_graph ] that the original @xmath1 edge , i.e. , the arc from 0 to 1 , now has a white vertex in its center which is connected to two black vertices ; so for each edge in our @xmath1-graph we can add a white vertex on top of it and two black vertices to the sides .",
    "we see some examples of this conversion in figures [ fig:3_star_graphs ] and [ fig : fish_becomes_spaceship ] .",
    "the advantage to converting our @xmath1-graphs to their @xmath4 versions is that there are many results available for subgroups of @xmath4 .",
    "one example of such a result is an algorithm developed by hsu ( @xcite ) to determine whether a group @xmath10 is congruence .",
    "he specifies such a @xmath0 by giving permutations associated to its @xmath4-graph , and his algorithm amounts to checking a list of relations .",
    "thus , if we consider one of our @xmath1-graphs , we can determine if the corresponding subgroup of @xmath1 is congruence by first converting it to a @xmath4-graph and then applying hsu s algorithm .",
    "for example , in applying this algorithm it turns out that the group @xmath0 which corresponds to the 3-star is noncongruence .",

    "firstly , the @xmath1-graphs have six times fewer edges than their @xmath4 counterparts , which simplifies computing and allows us to draw graphs for higher - index subgroups .",
    "secondly , we are less restricted on which graphs can occur ; in fact by parts 3 and 4 of birch s theorem [ correspondence_theorem ] we can interpret any graph as a @xmath1-graph , with no restrictions on the degrees of the black and white vertices",
    ". this flexibility can be useful .",
    "for example , in a forthcoming paper we will use these graphs to display infinite families of noncongruence subgroups of every possible even level on surfaces of genus 1 and 2 .",

    "we will interpret and generalize two of these results . when interpreted in terms of our graphs",

    "we can generalize this result as follows :    [ larcher_1_generalized ] let @xmath21 be a congruence subgroup of level @xmath3 . in the corresponding graph , for any face , let @xmath79 be the degree of that face and @xmath92 be the degree of any of its vertices",

    "now consider the vertex @xmath100 , and let @xmath105 be its image under the conjugation in the previous step .",
    "conjugation does not change the degree of a vertex , so the degree of @xmath105 is @xmath92 .",
    "notice that because the face @xmath99 is now centered at @xmath20 it is tiled by translates of @xmath18 under @xmath15 , and so the cusps corresponding to black vertices are found at even integers , while the cusps corresponding to the white vertices are found at odd integers .",
    "first suppose that the vertex @xmath100 is a black vertex .",
    "translation by the appropriate power of @xmath15 will fix @xmath20 and move @xmath105 to 0 .",
    "recall from part 3 of theorem [ correspondence_theorem ] the correspondence between groups and graphs is modulo conjugacy by translation : applying powers of @xmath15 will not change the graph or the face which is marked , and so the graph is still covered by @xmath2 .",
    "hence , larcher s congruence property is still satisfied .",
    "suppose instead that @xmath100 is a white vertex ; in this case we can move @xmath105 to 0 by conjugating by an odd power of @xmath106 . on the level of the graph this has the effect of switching the colors of the black and white vertices .",
    "the resulting group @xmath101 is congruence if and only if @xmath0 is congruence , because @xmath102 , and so larcher s congruence property holds .",
    "another result of larcher can also provide a powerful criteria for congruence :    [ larcher_2 ] if @xmath0 is a congruence subgroup of level @xmath91 then @xmath0 contains a cusp of width @xmath91 .    when interpreted for graphs the statement reads as follows :    [ larcher_2_graph ]",
    "if @xmath21 is a congruence subgroup of level @xmath3 , then the graph corresponding to @xmath0 has either a vertex or a face of degree @xmath11 .",
    "these criteria provide necessary conditions for congruence .",
    "consider the example in figure [ fig : fish_becomes_spaceship ] : the fish has vertices of degrees 1 , 2 , and 4 and faces of degree 1 and 3 , and thus the level of this graph is @xmath107 . because the graph does not contain a vertex or face of degree 12",
    ", we immediately conclude that the corresponding group is noncongruence .",
    "by contrast , if we were to apply hsu s algorithm as in the above section , we would need to work with the @xmath4 version of the graph ( the spaceship ) .",
    "this graph has permutations in @xmath108 and the computations are lengthy by comparison .",
    "however , the conditions are not sufficient : notice that while hsu s algorithm showed us that the 3-star corresponds to a noncongruence subgroup , the graph does not violate larcher s criteria above .",
    "we have an algorithm to determine congruence that depends only on graphs in section [ congruence_from_graphs ] .",
    "in what follows we describe a way to label a graph , which we will call the _ @xmath1-tiling of @xmath109_. in section [ graph_to_group ] , when we discussed a way to go from a graph to a group , we saw that the fundamental domain for a graph @xmath109 with @xmath11 edges consists of @xmath11 copies of @xmath18 , our fundamental domain for @xmath1 .",
    "we start by reexamining our graph and fundamental domain @xmath18 for @xmath1 as pictured in figure [ fig : domain_gamma2_graph ] .",
    "we label the face center at @xmath20 as @xmath54 , and use dotted lines to indicate the arc from 1 to @xmath20 and the arc from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "notice that crossing the arc from 1 to @xmath20 corresponds to applying the generator @xmath15 to @xmath18 , while crossing the arc from 0 to 1 corresponds to applying @xmath16 to @xmath18 .",
    "when it will prove helpful , we will indicate these operations in the quadrilateral .",
    "see figure [ fig : subdivide_domain ] .",
    "recall from section [ group_to_graph ] that if we are given a group @xmath21 we can construct the corresponding graph @xmath27 by first forming a fundamental domain for @xmath27 .",
    "we then identify its sides and fill in its cusps to form a riemann surface , and draw the graph using @xmath93 and its images as black vertices , @xmath19 and @xmath110 and their images as white vertices , and images of the arc from @xmath93 to @xmath110 as edges .",
    "one way we can form a @xmath1-tiling for @xmath27 is by taking the above and adding more labels : we explicitly label @xmath20 and its images as @xmath54 , and the images of the lines from @xmath19 to @xmath20 and from @xmath110 to @xmath20 as dotted lines . in doing so",
    ", we have tiled the surface @xmath111 with quadrilaterals , each of which corresponds to the tile in figure [ fig : subdivide_domain ] .",
    "recall from part 2 of theorem [ correspondence_theorem ] that specifying a graph involves marking one face with a @xmath51 ; this marking will appear in one of the tiles which comprises the corresponding face .",
    "( choosing a different tile within the face corresponds to conjugation by translation , as in part 3 of the theorem . )",
    "each tile is understood to carry the same labels of @xmath112 and @xmath113 as in figure [ fig : subdivide_domain ] , though as the graphs become more complicated these will not always be indicated .",
    "when we are specifically referring to the @xmath1-tiling which found in this way we will call it the _ standard @xmath1-tiling_.    suppose instead we are given a graph @xmath114 . to form a @xmath1-tiling we could first form a fundamental domain as we did in section [ graph_to_group ] and then proceed as above .",
    "instead we now describe a procedure to go directly from the graph to a @xmath1-tiling without using the fundamental domain as an intermediate step .",
    "first we label each face with a @xmath54 at its center .",
    "next , we add dotted lines from the white vertices to face centers in such a way that , as we rotate around a white vertex , the solid lines ( the graph edges ) and the dotted lines ( to the face centers ) alternate .",
    "this results in a surface tiled with quadrilaterals which is isotopic to the tiling we would have found by first constructing the fundamental domain as above .",
    "this isotopy is not unique , but we will fix one for each @xmath1-tiling .",
    "we will say that two @xmath1-tilings are equivalent if they are isotopic .",
    "we have several examples . in figure",
    "[ fig : subdivide_graph_gamma2 ] we see this process applied to the graph corresponding to @xmath1 itself .",
    "note that there is only one tile in this situation .",
    "figure [ fig : subdivide_3-star ] shows the @xmath1-tiling of the 3-star , which uses three tiles .    in figure",
    "[ fig : subdivide_graph ] we see an example of a tiling for a graph with five edges and two faces .",
    "figure [ fig : subdivide_graph_torus ] shows an example of a tiling for a graph with four edges which lies on a torus .",
    "now that we have @xmath1-tilings , we introduce some useful tools .",
    "first , notice the concept of a @xmath1-tiling allows us to extend the notion of applying a word @xmath24 in @xmath112 and @xmath113 to the graph itself in the following way : let @xmath114 be a graph with a @xmath1-tiling , let @xmath115 be a point in the interior of one of the tiles .",
    "to apply @xmath24 to @xmath115 , we isotope the tiling to the standard @xmath1-tiling , lift the standard tiling to the upper half - plane , and apply @xmath24 to the lift of @xmath115 .",
    "we then push down to the standard tiling and isotope back to our original @xmath1-tiling , labeling the image of this point as @xmath116 .",
    "we consider @xmath116 to be a point on @xmath114 associated to @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , @xmath115 has a unique point associated to it in every tile : two points @xmath117 and @xmath118 are considered _ associated _ if there exists @xmath23 so that @xmath119 .",
    "let @xmath114 be a graph with a @xmath1-tiling .",
    "a _ path on a graph @xmath114 _ is a path on the underlying punctured surface @xmath31 which is transverse to the tiling , begins at the marking @xmath51 of the marked face and ends at a point associated to @xmath51 .",
    "suppose we have a path on @xmath114 , a graph with a @xmath1-tiling .",
    "we can associate this path to a word @xmath24 in @xmath112 and @xmath113 by following the path starting at the base point @xmath51 and recording the labels as we cross each solid or dotted line , always multiplying the labels on the left .",
    "( if the path is a loop we must choose a direction . reversing the direction will form the inverse element @xmath120 . )",
    "conversely , suppose we are given a word @xmath24 in @xmath112 and @xmath113 and want to construct a path .",
    "we begin at @xmath51 and draw the path by crossing the appropriate solid or dotted line as we read each symbol of @xmath24 from right to left .",
    "the path will end at @xmath121 .",
    "these processes are essentially inverses : if we begin with a path and find its associated word , and then use this word to draw a path , the resulting path is isotopic to ( and thus considered equivalent to ) the original path .",
    "if we are given a word @xmath24 and find its associated path , then finding the word associated to this path will recover @xmath24 ( or perhaps @xmath120 if the path were a loop . )",
    "this association between group elements and paths is useful because of the following :    [ loops_are_elements ] let @xmath21 be a finite - index subgroup and @xmath114 be its corresponding graph with a @xmath1-tiling .",
    "suppose we have @xmath23 expressed as a word in @xmath112 and @xmath113 and its associated path on @xmath114 .",
    "then @xmath122 if and only if its associated path forms a loop .",
    "let @xmath115 be a lift of @xmath51 in the upper half - plane . by construction ,",
    "the path associated to @xmath24 begins at @xmath51 and ends at @xmath121 , where @xmath121 is found by applying @xmath24 to @xmath115 . if @xmath24 is associated to a loop , then @xmath123 on @xmath114 .",
    "this means that in the upper half - plane , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are equivalent under @xmath0 , so there is a @xmath124 with @xmath125 , and thus @xmath126 . because @xmath1 acts freely on the upper half - plane , the stabilizer of @xmath115 is trivial , so @xmath127 .",
    "thus @xmath128 , so @xmath122 .",
    "conversely , if the path associated to @xmath24 is not a loop , then @xmath116 is not equivalent to @xmath115 under @xmath0 , and thus @xmath129 .",
    "theorem [ loops_are_elements ] has many useful applications . in this section",
    "we will discuss how to use the @xmath1-tiling of a graph @xmath114 to read generators for its corresponding group @xmath21 in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "after forming the @xmath1-tiling of @xmath114 we form a collection of loops , each using the @xmath51 of the marked face as a base point .",
    "the collection will be chosen to generate the fundamental group of the underlying punctured surface @xmath111 . for a graph on a sphere ,",
    "we need @xmath130 loops , where @xmath100 is the total number of vertices and @xmath131 is the number of faces : we use a loop around all but one of the vertices and face centers . for a graph on a surface of genus",
    "@xmath104 we also add @xmath132 loops corresponding to generators of the fundamental group of the underlying compact surface .",
    "for each of these loops we then find the associated word @xmath24 in @xmath133 and @xmath134 ; we notate the collection of words as @xmath135 . by theorem [ loops_are_elements ] these words are all elements of @xmath0 .",
    "the direction we choose to follow each loop is irrelevant , because if @xmath24 is in a generating set for @xmath0 , we can replace @xmath24 with @xmath120 without changing @xmath0 . in theorem",
    "[ loops_are_generators ] we will see that @xmath135 is sufficient to generate @xmath0 . first we will see some examples .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma2_with_loops ] shows this process applied to the graph for @xmath1 itself .",
    "notice that as we follow the top loop in the counterclockwise direction we find the generator @xmath15 , and following the bottom loop in the clockwise direction produces the generator @xmath16 .",
    "this agrees with the fact that @xmath1 is generated by the elements @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "now consider the 3-star ; we found the @xmath1-tiling in figure [ fig : subdivide_3-star ] . in figure",
    "[ fig:3-star_with_loops ] we see this graph with loops added .",
    "we can find the generators by following each loop counterclockwise to determine that the group associated to the 3-star is @xmath136 .",
    "using the same process for the graph in figure [ fig : subdivide_graph ] , we find the group associated to this graph : @xmath137 notice that we have a choice of which vertex or face center to omit when forming loops ; in figure [ fig : subdivide_graph ] it is natural to avoid the white vertex in the upper - right because it has the highest degree .",
    "we next look at the graph on a torus from figure [ fig : subdivide_graph_torus ] . in figure [ fig : torus_with_loops ]",
    "we see three loops around cusps , and two loops ( vertical and horizontal ) which generate the fundamental group of a torus .",
    "the group associated to this graph is @xmath138    for another example , we use the graph on a surface of genus 2 pictured in figure [ fig : level12example ] .",
    "its @xmath1-tiling is shown in figure [ fig : level12example_with_generators ] , along with loops for generators .",
    "the labels on the tiles are not shown explicitely , though the conventions are the same .",
    "the group associated to this graph is @xmath139    having seen several examples , we now justify our prodcedure :    a finite - index subgroup @xmath21 can be generated by the words in @xmath135 found from the loops drawn as above for its associated graph .",
    "[ loops_are_generators ]    we see this by understanding the how the group @xmath0 is associated to a graph @xmath109 .",
    "first , refer to section [ graph_to_group ] : given a group @xmath0 , we find the associated graph by first finding a fundamental domain for @xmath0 , and then finding side - pairing transformations to form a punctured surface @xmath111 .",
    "notice that the punctures are at the vertices and face centers of the graph .",
    "the side - pairing transformations generate @xmath0 , which is the fundamental group of this punctured surface because @xmath140 , with @xmath0 acting freely on the upper - half plane @xmath141 .",
    "we can also compute the fundamental group of @xmath111 using algebraic topology . given a surface @xmath111 of genus",
    "@xmath104 with @xmath142 punctures , @xmath143 is a free group on @xmath144 generators .",
    "the generators are homotopy classes of loops ; @xmath132 for the genus of the surface , and loops around all but one of the punctures .",
    "these are the loops from which we formed our collection of words @xmath135 , each of which is associated to an element of @xmath0 as in theorem [ loops_are_elements ] .",
    "the operation of concatenation on the loops is compatible with the operation of multiplying the group elements , so the group generated by @xmath135 is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the surface .",
    "thus , though the generators we have found in @xmath135 might not directly correspond to side - pairing transformations of a fundamental domain for @xmath0 , they still generate the fundamental group @xmath0 of the punctured surface .",
    "suppose we have a graph @xmath145 corresponding to a finite - index subgroup @xmath146 of @xmath1 .",
    "now suppose we have another finite - index subgroup @xmath147 for which we know generators in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this section",
    "we will show how to determine whether @xmath148 .",
    "one useful application of this result is to determine whether a group is congruence : if @xmath146 has level @xmath3 and we know generators for @xmath2 , we can determine whether @xmath149 .",
    "the procedure is as follows : find a @xmath1-tiling for @xmath145 as we did in section [ relabel_graph ] .",
    "let @xmath24 be an element of @xmath150 expressed as a word in @xmath151 and @xmath113 , and find its associated path on @xmath152 .",
    "by applying theorem [ loops_are_elements ] we can determine whether @xmath24 is in @xmath146 by seeing if the path forms a loop . by testing the elements of a generating set for @xmath150",
    ", we can determine whether or not @xmath148 .",
    "we will look at some examples .",
    "consider the graph in figure [ fig : gamma06_graph ] .",
    "this graph corresponds to @xmath153 , which we know contains @xmath154 .",
    "if we were handed the graph out of context we could first compute that its level is 6 by finding the least common multiple of the degrees of its vertices and faces as we did in section [ section_graphs ] .",
    "next we check that the corresponding subgroup is congruence by testing a set of generators for @xmath154 to see if the associated paths form loops on our graph .",
    "the following generating set for @xmath154 was found by constructing a fundamental domain : @xmath155 in figure [ fig : gamma_06_tiled ] we see the path corresponding to the generator @xmath156 , which forms a loop . by checking all thirteen of the above generators",
    ", we can confirm that the graph represents a congruence subgroup .    if a graph of level @xmath3 represents a noncongruence subgroup it suffices to find any element of @xmath2 which violates the criteria .",
    "as an example , consider the 3-star , which is also level 6 , and thus if its associated @xmath0 is to be congruence it must contain @xmath154 . this graph does not violate the necessary conditions in larcher s statements in section [ larchers_results ] , so we can not immediately determine whether or not the subgroup is noncongruence .",
    "we see in figure [ fig:3-star_noncongruence ] the path corresponding to @xmath156 . unlike the above example",
    ", this path does not form a loop .",
    "we conclude that the group @xmath136 is a noncongruence subgroup of @xmath1 .    for a final example",
