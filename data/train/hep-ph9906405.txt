    "the small value of the flavour - singlet axial charge @xmath0 which is extracted from the first moment of @xmath1 ( the nucleon s first spin dependent structure function ) @xmath2 has inspired much theoretical and experimental effort to understand the internal spin structure of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "a key issue @xcite is the role of the axial anomaly in the transition from parton to constituent quark degrees of freedom in low energy qcd . in this paper",
    "i explain why some fraction of proton s spin may be carried by gluon topology .",
    "the topological contribution has support only at bjorken @xmath3 equal to zero .    in deep inelastic processes the internal structure of the nucleon",
    "is described by the qcd parton model @xcite .",
    "the deep inelastic structure functions may be written as the sum over the convolution of `` soft '' quark and gluon parton distributions with `` hard '' photon - parton scattering coefficients .",
    "the ( target dependent ) parton distributions describe a flux of quark and gluon partons carrying some fraction @xmath4 of the proton s momentum into the hard ( target independent ) photon - parton interaction which is described by the hard scattering coefficients .    in low energy processes",
    "the nucleon behaves like a colour neutral system of three massive constituent quark quasi - particles interacting self consistently with a cloud of virtual pions which is induced by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "one of the most challenging problems in particle physics is to understand the transition between the fundamental qcd `` current '' quarks and gluons and the constituent quarks of low - energy qcd .",
    "the fundamental building blocks are the local qcd quark and gluon fields together with the non - local structure @xcite associated with gluon topology @xcite .",
    "relativistic constituent - quark pion coupling models predict @xmath5  two standard deviations greater than the value of @xmath6 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "can we reconcile these two values of @xmath0 without abandoning the constituent quark picture of the nucleon ?",
    "the flavour - singlet axial charge @xmath0 is measured by the proton forward matrix element of the gauge invariantly renormalised axial - vector current @xmath7 viz .",
    "@xmath8 in qcd the axial anomaly @xcite induces various gluonic contributions to @xmath0 .",
    "the flavour - singlet axial - vector current satisfies the anomalous divergence equation @xmath9 where @xmath10\\ ] ] is a renormalised version of the chern - simons current and @xmath11 is the number of light - flavours .",
    "eq.(4 ) allows us to write @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 the partially conserved axial - vector current @xmath15 and the chern - simons current @xmath16 are separately gauge dependent .",
    "gauge transformations shuffle a scale invariant operator quantity between the two operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 whilst keeping @xmath17 invariant .",
    "one would like to isolate the gluonic contribution to @xmath0 associated with @xmath16 and thus write @xmath0 as the sum of `` quark '' and `` gluonic '' contributions .",
    "here we have to be careful because of the gauge dependence of @xmath16 .    whilst @xmath16 is a gauge dependent operator , its forward matrix elements are invariant under the `` small '' gauge transformations of perturbative qcd . in the qcd parton model one",
    "finds @xcite @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the amount of spin carried by quark and gluon partons in the polarised proton .    the polarised gluon contribution to eq.(9 )",
    "is characterised by the contribution to the first moment of @xmath1 from two - quark - jet events carrying large transverse momentum squared @xmath21 which are generated by photon - gluon fusion @xcite .",
    "the polarised quark contribution @xmath22 is associated with the first moment of the measured @xmath1 after these two - quark - jet events are subtracted from the total data set .",
    "the qcd parton model formula ( 9 ) is not the whole story .",
    "choose a covariant gauge .",
    "when we go beyond perturbation theory , the forward matrix elements of @xmath16 are not invariant under `` large '' gauge transformations which change the topological winding number @xcite .",
    "the topological winding number is a non - local property of qcd .",
    "it is determined by the gluonic boundary conditions at `` infinity '' @xcite  a large surface with boundary which is spacelike with respect to the positions @xmath23 of any operators or fields in the physical problem  and is insensitive to any local deformations of the gluon field @xmath24 or of the gauge transformation @xmath25  that is , perturbative qcd degrees of freedom .",
    "when we take the fourier transform to momentum space the topological structure induces a light - cone zero - mode which has support only at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "hence , we are led to consider the possibility that there may be a term in @xmath1 which is proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "it remains an open question whether the net non - perturbative quantity which is shuffled between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 contributions to @xmath0 under `` large '' gauge transformations is finite or not .",
    "if it is finite and , therefore , physical then we find a net topological contribution @xmath28 to @xmath0 @xcite @xmath29 the topological term @xmath28 has support only at @xmath26 .",
    "it is missed by polarised deep inelastic scattering experiments which measure @xmath30 between some small but finite value @xmath31 and an upper value @xmath32 which is close to one .",
    "as we decrease @xmath33 we measure the first moment @xmath34 this means that the singlet axial charge which is extracted from polarised deep inelastic scattering is the combination @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , elastic @xmath36 exchange processes such as @xmath37 elastic scattering @xcite and parity violation in light atoms @xcite measure the full @xmath0 .",
    "one can , in principle , measure the topology term @xmath28 by comparing the flavour - singlet axial charges which are extracted from polarised deep inelastic and @xmath37 elastic scattering experiments .",
    "if some fraction of the spin of the constituent quark is carried by gluon topology in qcd , then the constituent quark model predictions for @xmath0 are not necessarily in contradiction with the small value of @xmath6 extracted from deep inelastic scattering experiments .    the presence or absence of topological @xmath26 polarisation",
    "is intimately related to the dynamics of @xmath38 symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "a simple dynamical mechanism for producing topological @xmath26 polarisation is provided by crewther s theory of quark - instanton interactions @xcite . there , any instanton induced suppression of @xmath6 is compensated by a net transfer of axial charge or `` spin''from partons carrying finite momentum fraction @xmath39 to the flavour - singlet topological term at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "a large positive @xmath20 ( @xmath40 at @xmath41gev@xmath42 ) and topological @xmath26 polarisation are two possible explanations for the small value of @xmath6 .",
    "measurements of both quantities are urgently needed !",
