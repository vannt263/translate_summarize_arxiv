    "2004 ) , suggest that the three condensations in the smm1a are on their way to form low - mass stars .",
    "considering that the smm1a core has a mass of approximately 10@xmath22 , and assuming a core - to - star efficiency of @xmath23% ( evans et al .",
    "2009 ) , it is probable that a multiple stellar system with a total mass of 3 @xmath22 will eventually form in smm1a .",
    "table  1 lists the 450@xmath14 m and 850@xmath14 m fluxes estimated from the scuba images , and the 800@xmath14 m fluxes adopted from van  den  ancker ( 1999 ) . since sources smm1a - b and smm1a - c are not resolved in the jcmt observations , we treat them as one sub - core here . the scuba 450@xmath14 m fluxes",
    "are derived by fitting two - dimensional gaussians toward the two sub - cores ( smm1a - a and smm1a - b+c ) , while the 850@xmath14 m fluxes are estimated from the fluxes enclosed within roughly one beam around each sub - core .",
    "based on the sma 1.3 mm and jcmt submm data points , as well as the 3@xmath24 upper limits in the @xmath15 mips images , we construct the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the two sub - cores ( see figure  3 ) . in order to derive luminosities and temperatures , we first interpolate and then integrate the seds , always assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "interpolation between the flux densities is done by a @xmath25@xmath26 single - temperature grey - body fitting to all points ( including the upper limits ) .",
    "the resulting bolometric luminosities are @xmath270.08@xmath28 for smm1a - a and @xmath270.09@xmath28 for smm1a - b+c .",
    "the dust and bolometric temperatures are between 17 and 19k for the sources .",
    "the low luminosities and temperatures , as well as the fact that no compact infrared emission is detected from these sources in the @xmath15 images , resemble the typical properties of prestellar cores ( see review by andr et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the vla survey of the rcra region ,",
    "no radio source is detected at the positions of the three condensations presented here ( choi et al . 2008 ) .",
    "in contrast , the protostars smm1b ( class0/i ) and smm1c ( class0 ) to the north of smm1a are bright and centrally peaked at millimeter wavelengths ( fig.1a ) , and are associated with hard x - ray ( forbrich & preibisch 2007 ) , infrared ( fig.2a ) , and centimeter radio counterparts ( choi et al . 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , although the chemical and kinematic properties of smm1a are still poorly known , the observations thus far suggest that the three sources in smm1a are in an earlier evolutionary stage than that of class 0 protostars . as predicted by theoretical studies , there are different phases in the evolution from an initial isothermal ( 10k ) prestellar core to a class 0 protostar ( andr et al .",
    "the low luminosities ( @xmath270.1@xmath2 ) and temperatures ( close to 20k ) of the three sources in smm1a are similar to the predicted properties of so - called first hydrostatic ( adiabatic ) cores , which are formed after the isothermal collapse of prestellar cores ( e.g. , masunaga et al .",
    "1998 ; chen et al . 2010 ) .",
    "however , it must be noted that large uncertainties remain in our estimates due to the limited observations available .",
    "further high angular resolution observations at different wavelengths are needed to constrain the seds of the three sources in order to address more precisely their evolutionary statuses .",
    "regardless of this , it is fair to say that _ the rcra smm1a multiple system represents the earliest phase of core fragmentation observed thus far_.      prompt fragmentation of rotationally flattened cloud cores with initially flat density profiles , immediately after a phase of free - fall collapse , has long been suggested as one of the most efficient mechanisms for binary star formation ( tohline 2002 ) .",
    "since this fragmentation is expected to occur at the end of the isothermal collapse phase , it is also referred to as isothermal fragmentation .",
    "the separation of the fragments formed via prompt fragmentation has a scale of 10@xmath26@xmath1210@xmath29au , which corresponds to the jeans length in this phase .",
    "in contrast , other groups found that isothermal gas is stable against fragmentation and that core fragmentation can only occur during ( and after ) the adiabatic phase ( e.g. , truelove et al .",
    "1998 ; machida et al . 2008 ) .",
    "because this fragmentation occurs after the formation of the first adiabatic core , it is also called the first core fragmentation ( machida et al .",
    "2005 ) . here",
    ", the separation of the fragments formed generally has a scale of 3@xmath12300au ( machida et al .",
    "clearly , observing the earliest phase of core fragmentation is the most effective way to discriminate between prompt ( isothermal ) and adiabatic fragmentation scenarios . if prompt fragmentation does occur in the isothermal phase",
    ", we may expect to find a binary / multiple system consisting of adiabatic cores with the separation of @xmath51000au .    as shown in the scuba images ( see figure  1b ) , the rcra smm1a core is highly elongated with an aspect ration of roughly 3 , showing a morphology similar to the bars or filaments seen in the simulations of prompt ( isothermal ) fragmentation ( see , e.g. , bate & burkert 1997 ; tsuribe & inutsuka 1999 ; boss et al .",
    "2000 ) . from the mass and radius of the smm1a core ( see nutter et al . 2005 ) , the average volume density is calculated to be 1@xmath122@xmath1310@xmath30@xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding jeans length is @xmath51000au for a temperature of @xmath510k .",
    "the separations among the three sources found in the smm1a core are also consistent with this estimated jeans length .",
    "moreover , our results from the sed fitting ( see above ) suggest that the three sources are at an evolutionary stage earlier than that of class0 protostars , perhaps in the first ( adiabatic ) core stage .",
    "all these results appear to support the view that the three sources are formed through the prompt fragmentation of an elongated collapsing core during the isothermal phase . in this scenario",
    ", we would expect the rotational axis of smm1a to be perpendicular to the direction of the core s major axis , which would be roughly perpendicular to the large scale rotation observed in the rcra region by groppi et al .",
    "this is not necessarily inconsistent with our picture as other cores show drastic differences in the rotation axes measured at different scales ( e.g. , ohashi et al .",
    "we also note that so far most observed protostellar binary / multiple systems ( e.g. , l723 , launhardt 2004 ; or ngc2264 d - mm1 , teixeira et al . 2007 ) have separations in the scale of 1000au , which also supports the scenario of prompt fragmentation , although these protostellar systems have had at least a few 10@xmath29 yrs to evolve from their prestellar stage and thus their separations may not represent real initial conditions .    on the other hand ,",
    "as introduced above , prompt ( isothermal ) fragmentation has trouble accounting for the close binary systems with separations @xmath4100au .",
    "the fragmentation of cores at the adiabatic phase is still an attractive mechanism for close binary star formation . considering that the binary separation distribution in ( pre-)main sequence stars peaks at @xmath530au",
    ", we actually would expect to find frequently close protobinary systems with separations of @xmath4100au to support the adiabatic fragmentation scenario . in practice , however , the number of this kind of systems is very small .",
    "this observational result can be understood by the fact that current large millimeter interferometers ( e.g. , sma and iram - pdbi ) normally reach 12@xmath10 angular resolution under general conditions , and thus mostly resolve wide protobinary systems with separations of 200au or more in nearby star - forming clouds .",
    "we believe that routine observations at angular resolution better than 0.5@xmath10 will reveal more close protobinary systems , which will then allow us to study in detail a statistically significant number of protostellar binary / multipe systems with a wide range of separations ( from @xmath510au to 10@xmath29au ) .",
    "we present sma 1.3 mm dust continuum observations toward the rcra region .",
    "the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission is detected from dense cores smm1b , smm1c , and smm2 , and the herbig - ae star rcra in this region .",
    "we discover within the prestellar core candidate smm1a a multiple system made up of three condensations with masses in the range of 0.1 to 0.2@xmath0 .",
    "the angular separations between the three new sources are @xmath512.2@xmath10 and @xmath55.8@xmath10 , corresponding to the projected separations of @xmath52100au and @xmath51000au , respectively . based on sma observations and complementary data from the jcmt and @xmath15 telescopes ,",
