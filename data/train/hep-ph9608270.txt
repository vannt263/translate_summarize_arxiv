    "we discuss nonequilibrium oscillations between weak interacting electron neutrinos @xmath3 and sterile neutrinos @xmath4 for the case when @xmath4 do not thermalize till 2 @xmath5 and oscillations become effective after @xmath3 decoupling .",
    "oscillations of that type , but for the case of @xmath4 thermalizing before or around 2 @xmath5 have been already discussed in literature [ 1 - 8 ] . we have provided a proper kinetic analysis of the neutrino evolution in terms of _ kinetic equations for the neutrino density matrix in momentum space_. such approach , though much more complicated , reveals some beautiful features of noneqilibrium oscillations , that can not be catched otherwise .",
    "the assumptions of the model are the following :    * singlet neutrinos decouple much earlier than the active neutrinos do : @xmath6 , as far as they do not participate in the ordinary weak interactions .",
    "therefore , in later epochs their temperature and number densities are considerably less than those of the active neutrinos due to the subsequent annihilations and decays of particles that have additionally heated @xmath3 in equilibrium in comparison with the already decoupled @xmath4 .",
    "* we consider oscillations between the sterile @xmath4 and the active @xmath3 neutrinos , according to the majorana&dirac ( @xmath7 ) mixing scheme [ 9 ] .    for simplicity in what follows",
    "we accept a simple @xmath7-mixing scheme with mixing present just in the electron sector @xmath8 , @xmath9 : ( @xmath10 is the flalour index ) [ 10 ] . ]",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath4 denotes the sterile electron antineutrino , @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the mixing angle in the electron sector , the mass eigenstates @xmath15 and @xmath16 are majorana particles with masses correspondingly @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "when transitions between active and sterile neutrinos are allowed , sterile neutrinos may not decouple from the plasma earlier enough in comparisson with the active ones , so that their densities may not differ enough for a noneqilibrium to be considerable , or they may regain their thermal equilibrium if already decoupled [ 11 , 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the reactions of @xmath3 with the plasma are the source of thermalization for @xmath4 , because when oscillating into active neutrinos they may interact with the medium and thus thermalize .",
    "therefore ,    * we assume that neutrino oscillations become effective after the decoupling of the active neutrinos , @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "this puts constraint on the neutrino mass difference : @xmath21 @xmath22 .    *",
    "finally we require that sterile neutrinos have not thermalized till 2 @xmath5 when oscillations become effective . and also recent publications on the problem of thermalization of neutrinos by barbieri&dolgov [ 1 ] , kainulainen [ 2 ] and enqvist et al . [ 4 ] . ]",
    "this puts the following limit on the allowed range of oscillation parameters : @xmath23 .",
    "as far as for this model the rates of expansion of the universe , neutrino oscillations and neutrino interactions with the medium may be comparable , we have used kinetic equations for neutrinos accounting _ simultaneously _ for the participation of neutrinos into expansion , oscillations and interactions with the medium .",
    "moreover , as far as nonequilibrium oscillations are concerned , the density matrix of neutrinos considerably differs from its equilibrium form , and therefore one should work in terms of density matrix of neutrinos in momentum space [ 10 , 12 , 13 ] .",
    ", so that one can work with particle densities instead of @xmath24 . in an equilibrium background ,",
    "the introduction of oscillations slightly shifts @xmath24 from its diagonal form , due to the extreme smallness of the neutrino mass in comparison with the characteristic temperatures and to the fact that equilibrium distribution of massless particles is not changed by the expansion [ 10 ] .",
    "] we have analyzed the evolution of nonequilibrium oscillating neutrinos by numerically integrating the kinetic equations for the density matrix in _ momentum _",
    "space for the period after the decoupling of the electron neutrino till the freezing of neutron - proton ratio ( @xmath25-ratio ) , i.e. for @xmath26 .",
    "we considered both resonant @xmath27 and nonresonant @xmath28 neutrino oscillations .",
    "three main effects of neutrino nonequilibrium oscillations were revealed and precisely studied :    \\(a ) as far as oscillations become effective when the number densities of @xmath3 are much greater than those of @xmath4 , @xmath29 , the oscillations tend to reestablish the statitstical eqilibrium between different oscillating species . as a result @xmath30 will decrease in comparison to its standard eqilibrium value .",
    "( this result of our study is in accordance with other publications concerning depletion of electron neutrinos [ 3 - 7 ] ) .",
    "\\(b ) for the case of strongly noneqilibrium oscillations the distortion of the energy distribution of neutrinos may be considerable and must be accounted for properly . , but unfortunately , as far as the case of flavour neutrino oscillations were considered and the energy distortion for that case was shown to be negligible , it was not paid the necessary attention it deserved .",
    "] this effect was not discussed in publications concerning active - sterile neutrino oscillations , and was thought to be negligible . in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] it was first shown that for the case of @xmath31 _ vacuum oscillations _ this effect is considerable and may be even greater than that of an additional neutrino species . in the present work we discuss this effect for neutrino _ oscillations in a medium_.",
    "we have studied the evolution of the energy distortion using kinetic equations for neutrino density matrix in _ momentum space _ [ 10 , 12 , 13 ] . as far as these integro - differential equations are coupled nonlinear equations ,",
    "analytic solution can not be obtained without drastic assumptions .",
    "therefore , we have numerically explored the problem .",
    "the evolution of the distortion is the following : first the low energy part of the spectrum is distorted , and later on this distortion concerns neutrinos with higher and higher energies ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this behavior is natural , as far as neutrino oscillations affect first low energy neutrinos , @xmath32 .",
    "the naive account of this effect by shifting the effective temperature and assuming the neutrino spectrum of equilibrium form gives wrong results for the case @xmath33 . for bigger neutrino",
    "mass differences oscillations are fast enough and the naive account looks more acceptable , provided that @xmath3 have not decoupled .",
    "\\(c ) other interesting effect revealed by our approach is the generation of asymmetry between @xmath3 and their antiparticles .",
    "the possibility of an asymmetry generation due to cp - violating flavour oscillations was first proposed in ref .",
    "later estimations of an asymmetry due to cp - violating msw resonant oscillations were provided [ 15 ] .",
    "recently the problem of asymmetry was considered in connection with the exploration of the neutrino propagation in the cp - odd plasma of the early universe [ 1 - 5 ] and this type of asymmetry was obtained to be negligible .",
    "recently it was shown in ref .",
    "[ 16 , 7 ] , that asymmetry can grow to a considerable values for the case of great mass differences , @xmath34 was discussed .",
    "our approach allows precise description of the asymmetry and its evolution , as far as working with the _ selfconsistent kinetic equations for neutrinos in momentum space _ enabled us to calculate the behavior of asymmetry at each momentum .",
    "so , the calculated result may differ considerably from the rough estimations made by working with neutrino mean energy and with the integrated quantities like particle densities and the energy densities .",
    "for the nonresonant case we obtained that the asymmetry is negligible . the asymmetry effect is noticeable only for the resonant case , as it was expected .",
    "even when the asymmetry is assumed initially negligibly small ( of the order of the baryon one ) , i.e. @xmath35 , it may be considerably amplified at resonant transition due to different interactions of neutrinos and antineutrinos with the cp - odd medium .",
    "the value of the asymmetry may increase by several orders of magnitude , oscillating and sign changing .",
    "this behavior may remain such long after the resonant transition .",
    "( this behavior needs very high accuracy and thus complicates strongly the numerical analysis . ) even in case when the value of the asymmetry does not become considerable enough to have some direct noticeable effect , on primordial nucleosynthesis for example , the asymmetry term at the resonant transition determines the evolution of the neutrino density matrix .",
    "( as far as the leading order terms , namely of oscillation effects and interaction with the medium , compensate each other at resonant transition . )",
    "it effectively suppresses the transitions of active neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) thus weakening the effect of neutrino depletion at resonance .",
    "thus the evolution of neutrino may drastically differ from the case without asymmetry .",
    "for some model parameters this effect consists 20% of the previously discussed . we will discuss asymmetry evolution in more detail elsewhere . here",
    "finally we want only to note , that linear approximation for the asymmetry in the resonant case may give very misleading results .    as an illustration of the strength and importance of these effects",
    "we discuss their influence on the primordial production of @xmath0 .",
    "effect of oscillations on nucleosynthesis has been discussed in numerous publications [ 1 - 8 , 12 , 14 ] . however , a detail kinetic calculations of helium abundance for the case of nonequilibrium oscillations in medium has not been done .",
    "we describe it in the last section . here",
    "we briefly summerize the results :    the depletion of the electron neutrino number densities due to oscillations to sterile ones leads to an effective decrease in the weak processes rates , and thus to an increase of the freezing temperature of the @xmath25-ratio and corresponding overproduction of the primordially produced @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of the distortion of the energy distribution of neutrinos has two aspects .",
    "an average decrease of the energy of active neutrinos should lead to a decrease of the weak reactions rate , @xmath36 and subsequently to an increase in the freezing temperature and the produced helium . on the other hand",
    ", there exists an energy thershold for the reaction @xmath37 . and",
    "in case when , due to oscillations , the energy of the relatively greater part of neutrinos becomes smaller than that threshold the @xmath25- freezing ratio decreases [ 17 ] . however , the numerical analysis showed that the latter effect is less noticeable compared with the previously described ones .",
    "the asymmetry calculations showed a slight predominance of neutrinos over antineutrinos , leading to decrease of helium .",
    "the greater effect of the asymmetry is , however , the relative increase of both neutrino and antineutrino particle densities which leads to a noticeable underproduction of helium ( up to @xmath38 relative decrease ) thus , the total result of nonequilibrium neutrino oscillations is overproduction of helium in comparison to the standard value . we have used the @xmath39 relative increase in the primordially produced helium to obtain the exclusion region for the oscillation parameters .",
    "the kinetic equations for the density matrix of the noneqilibrium oscillating neutrinos in the primeval plasma of the universe in the epoch previous to nucleosynthesis , i.e. consisting of photons , neutrinos , electrons , and small quantities of nucleons , have the form : = h p   ( t ) p + i + i + o(h^2_int ) , [ kin ] where @xmath40 is the momentum of electron neutrino and @xmath24 is the density matrix of the massive majorana neutrinos in momentum space .",
    "the first term in the equation describes the effect of expansion , the second is responsible for oscillations , the third accounts for forward neutrino scattering off the medium .",
    "@xmath41 is the free neutrino hamiltonian : @xmath42 while @xmath43 is the interaction hamiltonian , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and in the interaction basis plays the role of induced squared mass for electron neutrinos : @xmath46 the first ` local ' term in @xmath47 accounts for charged- and neutral - current tree - level interactions with medium protons , neutrons , electrons and positrons , neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "it is proportional to the fermion asymmetry of the plasma @xmath48 , which is assumed of the order of the baryon one @xmath49 the second ` nonlocal ' term arises as an @xmath50 propagator effect , @xmath51 . for the early universe conditions both terms",
    "must be accounted for because although the second term is of the second power of @xmath52 , the first term is proportional besides to the first power of @xmath52 , to the very small value of the fermion asymmetry ( of the order of the baryon asymmetry , i.e. @xmath53 in case @xmath54 conservation is accepted ) [ 18 ] .",
    "moreover , the two terms have different temperature dependence and an interesting interplay between them during the cooling of the universe is observed .    the last term in the eq .",
    "( [ kin ] ) describes the weak interactions of neutrinos with the medium .",
    "for example , for the weak reactions of neutrinos with electrons and positrons @xmath55 , @xmath56 it has the form @xmath57 \\\\ + & \\int { \\rm d}\\omega(e^-,\\nu',e'^-)\\left [ n'_{e^- } { \\cal b } \\rho ' { \\cal b}^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\ { { \\cal b}^\\dagger { \\cal b } , ~\\rho \\right\\}_+ n_{e^- } \\right ] \\\\ + & \\int { \\rm d}\\omega(e^+,\\nu',e'^+)\\left [ n'_{e^+ } { \\cal c } \\rho ' { \\cal c}^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\ { { \\cal c}^\\dagger { \\cal c } , ~\\rho \\right\\}_+ n_{e^+ } \\right ] , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 stands for the number density of the interacting particles , @xmath59 is the amplitude of the process @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the amplitude of the process @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the amplitude of the process @xmath64 .",
    "they are expressed through the known amplitudes @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 : @xmath68 we have analysed the evolution of the neutrino density matrix assumed that oscillations become noticeable after electron neutrinos decoupling .",
    "so , the neutrino kinetics down to 2 @xmath5 does not differ from the standard case , i.e. electron neutrinos maintain their equilibrium distribution , while sterile neutrinos are absent .",
    "then the last term in the kinetic equation can be neglected .",
    "the equation results into a set of coupled nonlinear integro - differential equations for the components of the density matrix .",
    "analytical solution is not possible .. ]    we have numerically calculated the evolution of the neutrino density matrix for temperature interval @xmath69~ mev$ ] , i.e. after neutrino decoupling and till the @xmath25 freezing .",
    "the oscillation parameters range studied is @xmath70~ev^2 $ ] and @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the baryon asymmetry @xmath72 was taken to be @xmath73 .",
    "as was already stated our numerical analysis showed that the nonequilibrium oscillations can considerably deplete the number densities of electron neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) and distort their energy spectrum .",
    "neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry may grow at the resonant transition and may also effect considerably the evolution of neutrino ensembles .",
    "the kinetic equation describing the evolution of the neutron number density in momentum space @xmath74 for the case of oscillating neutrinos @xmath31 reads :    cl n_n t = h p_n   n_n p_n & + ( e^-,p , ) |a(e^- pn)|^2 ( n_e^- n_p - n_n _ ll ) + & - ( e^+,p , ) |a(e^+np)|^2 ( n_e^+ n_n - n_p |_ll ) .",
    "the first term describes the expansion and the second one  the processes @xmath75 and @xmath76 , directly influencing the nucleon density .",
    "it differs from the standard scenario one only by the substitution of @xmath77 and @xmath78 instead of @xmath79 .",
    "the neutrino and antineutrino density matrices may differ @xmath80 , contrary to the standard model , as a result of the different reactions with the cp - odd plasma of the prenucleosynthesis epoch .",
    "number densities per unit volume are expressed as @xmath81 .",
    "we have numerically integrated the equation for the temperature range of interest @xmath82~ mev$ ] for the range of oscillation parameters of our model .",
    "the results of the numerical integration are illustrated in fig .  2 , in comparison with the vacuum case and the standard nucleosynthesis without oscillations .",
    "it is obvious that the kinetic effects of the nonequilibrium oscillations on nucleosynthesis are considerable .",
    "the next figure presents the dependence of the primordially produced helium on mixing angle ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    from numerical integration for different oscillation parameters",
    "we have obtained constant @xmath0 contours . the fig .",
    "4 gives the cosmologically excluded regions of oscillation parameters .",
    "it corresponds to primordial abundance of helium @xmath83 , which gives @xmath39 overproduction of helium in comparison with the observational value .    for the cases when the energy distortion and asymmetry are considerable",
    "we have obtained an order of magnitude stronger constraints than the cited in literature [ 4 - 7 ] .",
    "therefore , in conclusion we would like to stress once again , that in case of nonequilibrium neutrino oscillations working with the exact kinetic equations for the density matrix of neutrinos in momentum space is necessary .",
