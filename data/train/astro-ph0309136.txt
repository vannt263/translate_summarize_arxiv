    "we set up the initial conditions for the orbital motion of a dg around a galaxy of larger mass ( the mw in our case ) .",
    "this task is hampered by the very small number of galaxies for which good determinations of the proper motions from direct observations are currently available ( irwin 1998 ) .",
    "the original sample of more than 40 galaxies belonging to the lg drastically reduce to 5 , all of them satellites of the mw .",
    "the orbital parameters for this small group of objects are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".components of the galactocentric velocity vector @xmath0 ) , where @xmath1 points in the direction of the sun , @xmath2 in the direction of the rotation of the galaxy and @xmath3 to form a left - handed system .",
    "the velocities refer to the motion of the galaxy barycentre . the selected dwarf galaxy for our scope will be sculptor .",
    "the velocities are in km s@xmath4 . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     [ table1 ]    the dirr galaxy",
    ", whose dynamical structure is tested against the gravitational interaction with a large mass object , is supposed to have been formed in the past and to be made of three components : dm , gas , and stars in suitable proportions .",
    "the total mass of the galaxy is given by the sum of the three components @xmath5 with obvious meaning of the symbols .",
    "the rotation curves ( hoffman et al . 1996 ) and cosmological arguments ( mateo 1998 and reference therein ) have clearly indicated that galaxies ( the dwarf ones in particular ) are dm dominated .",
    "therefore we assume that @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , dirrs are known to be gas - rich , with the gaseous content almost paralleling the stellar content .",
    "we adopt here @xmath7 .    the time scale required to build up the dirr galaxy to the stage we are considering",
    "is not relevant here provided it is significantly shorter than the hubble time .",
    "furthermore , stellar activity is supposed to be still underway so that during the simulation more gas is converted into stars .",
    "finally , let us denote with @xmath8 the age of the dirr at the start of the dynamical simulation . to set up the starting model we have followed hernquist ( 1993 ) , whose models have been extensively proved to produce stable configurations for systems with more than one component for a widely explained descrition on the assumption made see pasetto et al .",
    "( 2003 in press ) .",
    "having assigned the initial conditions , the evolution of the dirr ( disk ) galaxy in isolation has been followed by means of the n - body tree - sph code in the last version described by lia et al.(2002 ) the evolution is first followed in isolation to check the dwarf galaxy model stability and then in evolution around the mw whose presence is simply reduced to a force field generated by a suitable , constant gravitational potential at the coordinate origin and with no rotation . in this study",
    "we neglect the dynamical friction as suggested in colpi & pallavicini ( 1998 ) and colpi ( 1998 ) as far as the morphology of the satellite is concerned , two passages at the peri - center are sufficient to make evident the effect we are looking for .",
    "the situation is shown in fig.[figure1 ] in which a 3-d large scale view of the satellite orbiting about the mw is given at the age @xmath9 gyr , i.e. after two close passages .",
    "\\(i ) a bound blob of gas , stars and dm with total mass of about @xmath10 and almost round shape survives . in order to better understand the morphology of the new dsph , in fig.[figure1 ] we present 3d projections of iso - number density regions in the space of positions limited to the sole stellar component so that direct comparison with isophotal contours is possible . in the projection",
    "there is a distinct central concentration of stars with nearly spherical shape surrounded by regions of much lower number density .",
    "the newly born object is indeed a spheroidal galaxy .",
    "\\(ii ) the dsph is still dm dominated but for the very central regions where the baryonic mass prevails ; it is almost void of gas ( or very little ) which has partly converted to stars and partly lost in the wind and tails stripped by the mw .",
    "these properties are typical of dsph and strongly suggest that the kind of metamorphosis indicated by the simulations is at work ( see pasetto et al . ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the mayor change occurring in the dsph concerns its kinematics .",
    "compared to the initial ones , all the three are lower by a factor of 3 indicating that the initial circular motions have been turned into motions equally shared along the three directions ( see pasetto et al . ) .",
    "\\(iv ) finally , we look at the stellar surface brightness profile ( see fig [ figure1 ] ) . compared to the profile of the initial the surface brightness profile of the new dsph tends to be steeper toward the center as often observationally indicated for the dgs in the local group ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "\\(v ) for the case under consideration the time scale was of the order of two passages past the mw ( approximately 4 gyr or shorter ) .",
    "this secures _ a posteriori _ that neglecting dynamical friction , and consequent evolution of the relative distance between the satellite and the mw , and finally the deformation of the mw and consequent spiraling in of the dg towards this , was not too a bad approximation : see colpi & pallavicini ( 1998 ) , and colpi ( 1998 ) for more details and a comparison with n - body simulations .",
    "\\(vi ) the resulting dsph seems to be stable . as a matter of fact",
    ", it survives another close encounter at least at @xmath11 .",
    "actually this helps the dsph to get a total mass in closer agreement with the observational estimates for dgs of the lg ( mateo 1998 )    \\(vii ) it seems therefore that the intensity of star formation is somehow sensitive to the interaction .",
    "however , as far as the correlation ( if any ) of the star forming bursts with the orbital position of the satellite with respect to the mw ( cf .",
    "mayer et al . 2001 ) it seems that the most intense ones are favored when the satellite galaxy is at the peri - galactic .",
    "the preliminary conclusion would be that sf is mainly driven by internal processes ( see fig.[figure1 ] ) .",
