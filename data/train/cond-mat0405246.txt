    "the inelastic point - contact spectra of phonons in metals are based on expansion of the nonlinear @xmath2 characteristic in terms proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the characteristic size of metallic nanoconstriction connecting two bulk metal half - spaces and @xmath5 is the inelastic electron mean free path @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 is smaller than the electron mean free path @xmath6  ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the elastic mean free path ) , the electrons flow through the contact ballistically . in opposite cases",
    "@xmath9 they perform a diffusive motion , but if the energy relaxation length @xmath10 remains larger than @xmath4 , their movement inside the constriction is conservative , and the inelastic point - contact spectroscopy is still possible @xcite .    in the superconducting state",
    "a new characteristic length appears : the size of the cooper pair or the coherence length @xmath11 and the additional nonlinear  features emerge being proportional to the expansion of the so called  excess  current in terms proportional to @xmath12 in all the cases considered , the size of the contact is smaller than the corresponding characteristic length scale : @xmath13 _ etc_.    the zero - approximation in expansion of @xmath14 in @xmath15 is the ohmic current considered by sharvin @xcite . from the sharvin s formula the characteristic size @xmath4 of the contact can be determined in the ballistic limit .",
    "the second derivative of the first approximation in expansion of @xmath14 in @xmath16 is directly proportional to the spectral function of electron - phonon interaction ( pc epi ) @xmath17 of the specific point - contact transport both in the normal and in the superconducting states @xcite .",
    "this term is the basis of the canonical inelastic point - contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the average electron - phonon matrix element taking into account the kinematic restriction imposed by contact geometry and @xmath19 is the phonon density of states .    in diffusive point contacts @xmath20 the role of the scale , where the backscattering inelastic processes become essential , turns from @xmath4 in @xmath21 and in the case when @xmath22 the corresponding contribution becomes negligible @xcite .",
    "this property will be essential when we consider the phonon structure in point - contact spectra of dirty mgb@xmath1 contacts in the _ c_-direction .    in the superconducting state , due to the andreev reflections of quasiparticles at the @xmath23 boundary , the excess",
    "current appears both in @xmath24 and @xmath25 contacts ( @xmath26 stands for constriction ) .",
    "its magnitude is the constant proportional to @xmath27 for the weak - coupling bcs approximation at @xmath28 ( @xmath27 is the superconducting energy gap ) @xcite . in the strong - coupling model of epi",
    "the energy gap depends on the energy of quasiparticles due to phonon retardation effects reflecting the characteristic features of the phonon spectrum at singular van - hove energies . hence , even in the zeroth order the nonlinearities appear in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "for the issue of this study it is most important that these nonlinearities are independent of the elastic mean free path ( i.e. , purity of the contact ) . in this connection",
    "one should keep in mind that for the simple method of a gentle touch between two sharp edges of the electrodes it is not possible to control the elastic mean free path in the constriction . in what follows",
    "we show that in spite of this restriction , the satisfactorily reproducible results are obtained not only for the shapes of phonon structure but also for their amplitude .",
    "to conclude this section , we mention that the use of the first approximation in expansion of excess current in powers of @xmath29 allows the nonequilibrium effects in the vicinity of the constriction to be developed , which are out of the scope in this paper @xcite .",
    "in this section we review what has recently become known about the phonon structure in the point - contact spectra @xcite . in order to do this",
    ", we should refer to the works where the excess current in point contact is considered in terms of the strong - coupling theory .",
    "that was first done in the paper of omelyanchuk , beloborodko and kulik for ballistic @xmath24 point contact @xcite .",
    "the first derivative of @xmath14-characteristic at @xmath30 has the following form in this case :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the resistance of the contact in the normal state .",
    "this expression implies @xmath33 to be fulfilled ( @xmath34 is the coherence length in pure metal ) .    for diffusive point contact with the restriction :",
    "@xmath35 the same quantity takes the form @xcite :    @xmath36    we would like to compare these dependences with the expression for the conductance of the tunnel junction due to the self - energy effect in the superconducting energy gap :    @xmath37    in the above mentioned formulae @xmath38 is the complex superconducting order parameter @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively",
    ". it would be very instructive to express eqs .",
    "( [ bal1 ] ) , ( [ dif1 ] ) , ( [ tun1 ] ) as functions of real and imaginary components .",
    "thus , using the auxiliary expression @xmath44 the results are as follows :    @xmath45 ,   \\label{bal2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath46   \\nonumber   \\\\",
    "\\times \\frac{\\varepsilon \\sqrt{a+\\varepsilon ^{2}-\\delta _ { 1}^{2}+\\delta _ { 2}^{2}}}{\\delta _ { 1}\\sqrt{a+\\varepsilon ^{2}-\\delta _ { 1}^{2}+\\delta _ { 2}^{2}}\\pm \\delta _ { 2}\\sqrt{a-\\varepsilon ^{2}+\\delta _ { 1}^{2}-\\delta _ { 2}^{2}}},\\label{dif2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where  plus  and  minus  in the last line stand for  @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "finally , for tunnel junction the same quantity reads :    @xmath49    expressions ( [ bal1 ] ) , ( [ dif1 ] ) , ( [ tun1 ] )  [ and ( [ bal2 ] ) , ( [ dif2 ] ) , ( [ tun2 ] ) ] seem quite different but in reality they are very similar .",
    "this becomes evident if we compare their asymptotic expressions for the limit @xmath50 .",
    "for three extreme regimes of current flow in aforementioned point contacts the corresponding equations take the form :    for a ballistic point contact :    @xmath51    for a diffusive point contact :    @xmath52    and for a tunnel junction :    @xmath53    in all these equations @xmath54 and @xmath30 are implied .",
    "since @xmath55 becomes comparable to @xmath40 only at the highest phonon energy , almost in the whole phonon energy range these three extreme regimes of current flow differ only little , mostly in amplitudes , which decrease in the tunnel@xmath56diffusive@xmath56ballistic contact row like their prefactors @xmath57 .",
    "this derivation is of a key importance to understanding the quite similar phonon point - contact spectra for the different contacts randomly accessible in the experiment .",
    "let us illustrate the above theoretical formulae by an example of superconducting pb frequently used for these purposes in tunneling spectroscopy of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "this metal has the relatively strong epi and a simple phonon spectral function , consisting of two acoustic peaks : transverse ( ta ) and longitudinal ( la ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we take the tabulated functions : @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 from rowell - mcmillan - dynes@xmath61 preprint @xcite and plot both the epi spectral function and the second derivative characteristic @xmath62 proportional to the experimentally recorded second harmonic of modulation voltage , @xmath63 ( see the text below ) .",
    "one can immediately see that three point - contact spectra ( tunnel , diffusive and ballistic ) are very similar differing only in the constant prefactor at @xmath64 ^{2}$ ] ( see above ) .",
    "the differences in shape occur only at the second peak of the epi spectrum , where @xmath60 becomes essential .",
    "for the transverse peak the positions of maxima of point - contact spectra @xmath63 coincide with the ta - maximum of epi function shifted by @xmath27 to the right ( we remind that throughout this paper @xmath65 contact is considered ) . on the other hand , the maxima of @xmath63 functions at la peak are slightly displaced with respect to the epi function and their shapes change , which becomes more pronouced the further we deviate from the tunnel junction in the row mentioned above .     characteristics for superconducting lead @xmath24 point contact calculated by eqs .",
    "( [ tun2 ] ) , ( [ dif2 ] ) , ( [ bal2 ] ) for the tunnel ( solid curve ) , diffusive ( dash - dotted curve ) and ballistic ( dotted curve ) regimes of current flow .",
    "@xmath66  and @xmath43  are taken from the rowell - mcmillan - dynes @xcite tabulation .",
    "squared symbols stand for rowell - mcmillan - dynes @xcite epi spectral function shifted by @xmath67 mev to the right on the voltage scale .",

    "( [ bal2 ] ) , ( [ dif2 ] ) , ( [ tun2 ] ) ) with the asymptotic ones ( eqs . ( [ bal3 ] ) , ( [ dif3 ] ) , ( [ tun3 ] ) )",
    ", we see that for pb the differences are only minor ( the example for diffusive point - contact is shown in fig .",
    "it goes without saying that the differences for materials with greater ratios of phonon energy to the energy gap , @xmath68 , will be very small .",
    "for example , in sn or mgb@xmath1 , where @xmath69 the differences between exact and asymptotic curves in the phonon energy range become indistinguishable .    ) and asymptotic ( [ dif3 ] ) calculated curves for lead in the @xmath24 point contact .",
    ", width=302 ]    experimentally , the expected shift of the pb phonon spectra to the right was first noticed in ref . .",
    "unfortunately , in this paper ( and also in the review paper @xcite ) the experimental curves were compared with theoretical ones without allowing for the shift of the latter by @xmath27 to the right . in fig .",
    "3 this drawback is corrected and the important consequences are drawn for the ballistic point contact .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "3 displays two experimentally recorded dependences : i ) the second derivative of the @xmath70 characteristic in the normal state ( superconductivity is destroyed by the magnetic field ) and ii ) the same dependence in the superconducting state . the bcs dependence in the superconducting state",
    "is shown for comparison . the theoretically expected point - contact spectrum for ballistic contact",
    "is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "it is compared with the experimental pc epi spectrum in the normal state shifted by @xmath71 mev . as expected",
    ", the position of the _ calculated _ ta - maximum coincides with the ta - maximum in the normal - state spectrum and the corresponding feature ( zero of @xmath72-coordinate ) coincides with the normal - state la - maximum ( see fig .",
    "mev to the right .",
    "the theoretical bcs dependence is shown for comparison ( thin dotted curve).,width=302 ]    in contrast , the phonon features on the _ experimental _ curve in the superconducting state shown in the upper panel are noticeably displaced to the left from the expected calculated positions ( shown in the lower panel ) towards the non - shifted phonon maxima .",
    "this displacement is the result of mixing at least of two different mechanisms of revealing the phonon features : namely , the inelastic backscattering current , which has the same positions both in the superconducting and the normal states ( the latter is shown as an experimental pc  epi curve in upper panel of fig .",
    "3 ) , and the theoretical zeroth - order approximation of excess current shown as a theoretical curve in the lower panel . such mixing seriously impedes interpretation of pc spectra of a ballistic strong - coupling superconductor . fortunately ,",
    "as mentioned above , in diffusive point contact the inelastic backscattering current is negligible and the pure self - energy effect on excess current becomes clearly visible .",
    "the latter situation holds in mgb@xmath1 films measured along the @xmath26-direction as well .",
    "for two - band superconductor mgb@xmath1 ( see the review @xcite ) the @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath0 and @xmath75-band are depicted in the upper and lower panel of fig .",
    "4 @xcite , respectively .",
    "we are interested mostly in the @xmath76-band dependences , since for thin films oriented along the @xmath26-axis only the @xmath77band part of the fermi surface has nonzero fermi velocity for charge carriers ( holes ) along the contact axis , playing the main role in the contact current . for the @xmath75-band , which is two - dimensional , only holes with the velocity in the @xmath78-plane exist .",
    "the driving force for superconductivity is the very strong epi of these holes with the @xmath79-phonon mode with the energy of about 70 mev .",
    "this mode is seen as the strong peak in @xmath80 in the lower panel of fig .",
    "note , that the ordinate scale for the latter panel is about three times higher than that for the @xmath0-band . for the @xmath77band all the phonons in the energy range",
    "@xmath81 mev take part in the @xmath82 dependence , but with a lower magnitude as compared with the @xmath75-band .",
    "up to about 80 mev @xmath83 is small , hence , only @xmath73 is important in eqs .",
    "( [ bal3 ] ) , ( [ dif3 ] ) , ( [ tun3 ] ) .",
    "thus , we expect that up to @xmath84 mev the point - contact spectra differ only in amplitude just like the prefactors in the @xmath85 ^{2}$ ] term .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "-dependences for @xmath0- and @xmath75-bands ( upper and lower panels , respectively ) of mgb@xmath1 @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    we can see that up to the energies @xmath86 mev the shapes of the calculated spectra are similar ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "the discrepancy is observed only at higher energies , where @xmath87 becomes essential . in the range of biases",
    "80@xmath88120 mev the variations of point - contact spectra are quite appreciable and mirror in the experimental curves .",
    "although the @xmath89 value is of the order of @xmath90 at biases higher than 120 mev , the phonon features on the pc spectra are small enough , due to the factor @xmath91 .",
    "when we compare theoretical and experimental curves , we consider only the biases up to 120 mev , since for higher biases the experimental results are irreproducible , due to nonequilibrium suppression of the superconducting state in the contact .    - and @xmath75-bands ( upper and lower panels , respectively ) of mgb@xmath1 @xcite for ballistic ( dashed curve ) , diffusive ( thick solid curve ) and tunnel ( dotted curve ) regimes of current flow .",
    "real and imaginary parts of @xmath92 are taken from fig .",
    "4.,width=302 ]    comparison of calculated and experimental curves is shown in fig .",
    "6 . for the ordinate scale we use the second harmonic voltage @xmath93 measured in experiment , which is related to the second derivative of the @xmath2 characteristic as follows :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the modulation voltage , which is conventionally taken equal to 3 mev ( close to the value used in the experiment ) .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 three different point - contact spectra are shown .",
    "they have similar shape up to 100 mev with a slight increase of average amplitudes in the row @xmath96 49@xmath5636@xmath5680 @xmath97 . in the same sequence the so - called zero - bias maximum in the @xmath98 characteristic increases ( not shown ) , being @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively ( @xmath102 is the zero - bias resistance in the superconducting state ) , for the above mentioned row .",
    "one may speculate that in the same direction the contact changes from ballistic towards the tunnel regime to the ballistic regime with the tunnel barrier having @xmath103 parameter of about @xmath104 .",
    "in most cases this value of @xmath103 in the btk @xcite fitting corresponds to the diffusive regime of current flow .",
    "this happens in many cases , where the same @xmath103 value have many junctions with quite different materials as dissimilar electrodes . ] .",
    "the lower panel of fig . 6 shows that in the same row the average amplitude of phonon structure increases in the calculated curves .    .",
    "the contact axis is oriented along the @xmath26-axis .",
    "the normal state resistances are given for each curve .",
    "in the experimental panel the upper curve corresponds to the ordinate scale , and the other two are shifted down for clarity .",
    "k. in the theoretical ( lower ) panel three transport regimes are illustrated on the same scale as in the experimental graph .",
    "here , the lower curve corresponds to the ordinate scale , the other two are shifted up for clarity . the @xmath106-band epi function ( dashed curve ) @xcite",
    "is shifted to higher voltages by @xmath107 mev .",
    "the modulation voltage is taken equal to 3 mv .",
    ", width=302 ]    the positions of the maxima of the experimental phonon features roughly correspond to the expected ones taking into account that the orientation of experimental junction is approximately along the @xmath26-axis , since the spreading behavior of current in direct conductivity point contact embraces a wide solid angle near the contact axis . the alignment of our contacts along the @xmath26-axis is inferred indirectly by measuring the andreev reflection spectra in the energy gap region and by observation of only the small gap @xmath108 mev characteristic of the @xmath76-band .",
    "special attention should be paid to the amplitude of the experimental curves , which roughly equals that predicted theoretically . in inelastic spectroscopy",
    "the amplitude of the epi spectrum is an order of magnitude lower than expected one ( see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "and the discussion cited therein ) .",
    "this discrepancy may be explained either by the diffusive regime of current flow with and unknown mean free path @xmath8 , or by the specific pc - transport character of the epi function obtained from the inelastic backscattering spectrum .",
    "comparing theoretical and experimental spectra , one can infer that all the phonons are essential in the epi function for the @xmath76-band . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 we plot the @xmath109 function taken from ref . . as expected , the maxima in the epi spectral function shifted by @xmath110 to the right coincide approximately with the maxima in the second harmonic dependences @xmath111",
    "the self - energy effect in the phonon feature of a superconducting point contact can be used , in principle , in the same way as the rowell - mcmillan program for determination of the epi spectral function in tunneling spectroscopy of superconductors @xcite .",
    "two difficulties arise on this way .",
    "one is theoretical , since this program works well only for the one - band superconductor , and its application to the two - band case , like mgb@xmath1 , encounters difficulties @xcite .",
    "the other is experimental , since all other sources of @xmath2 nonlinearities should be removed , and especially , the nonequilibrium effects in superconductor should be excluded .",
    "the result obtained for superconductivity in mgb@xmath1 is the first direct proof of validity of the calculated epi function @xcite , at least in the @xmath0-band .",
    "unfortunately , this method encounters difficulty , while applying it to the @xmath112-band . in this case the very strong generation of nonequilibrium phonons can not be efficiently excluded from the contact region and this destroys the superconductivity in the constriction",
    ".    the question may arise whether the self - energy effects are important in the normal state .",
    "these are known to be smaller than the inelastic backscattering nonlinearities in the ballistic regime @xcite .",
    "if we decrease the contact size @xmath4 or the elastic mean free path @xmath8 in order to make the inelastic contribution negligible , the latter parameters become comparable to the fermi wave length of charge carriers and the strong nonlinearities connected with localization occur , which masks the desired phonon structure @xcite .",
