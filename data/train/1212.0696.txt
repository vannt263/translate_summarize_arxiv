    "heavy quarks are an ideal probe for the qgp .",
    "they are produced in the primordial hard collisions of the nuclear reaction and therefore probe the created medium during its entire evolution process .",
    "when the system cools down they hadronize , and their decay products can finally be detected .",
    "therefore , heavy - quark observables provide new insights into the interaction processes within the hot and dense medium .",
    "two of the most interesting observables are the elliptic flow , @xmath0 , and the nuclear modification factor , @xmath1 , of open - heavy - flavor mesons and their decay products like `` non - photonic '' single electrons .",
    "the measured large elliptic flow , @xmath0 , of open - heavy - flavor mesons and the `` non - photonic single electrons or muons '' from their decay underline that heavy quarks take part in the collective motion of the bulk medium , consisting of light quarks and gluons .",
    "the nuclear modification factor shows a large suppression of the open - heavy flavor particles spectra at high transverse momenta ( @xmath3 ) compared to the findings in pp collisions .",
    "this also supports a high degree of thermalization of the heavy quarks with the bulk medium .    in this letter",
    "we explore the medium modification of heavy - flavor @xmath3 spectra , using a hybrid model , consisting of the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model @xcite and a full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamical model @xcite to simulate the bulk medium . the heavy - quark propagation in the medium",
    "is described by a relativistic langevin approach @xcite .",
    "similar studies have recently been performed in a thermal fireball model with a combined coalescence - fragmentation approach @xcite , in an ideal hydrodynamics model with a lattice - qcd eos @xcite , in a model from kolb and heinz @xcite , in the bamps model @xcite , the martini model @xcite as well as in further studies and model comparisons @xcite .",
    "the urqmd hybrid model has been developed to combine the advantages of transport theory and ( ideal ) fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "it uses initial conditions , generated by the urqmd model @xcite , for a full ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional ideal fluid dynamical evolution , including the explicit propagation of the baryon current . after a cooper - frye transition back to the transport description",
    ", the freeze out of the system is treated dynamically within the urqmd approach .",
    "the hybrid model has been successfully applied to describe particle yields and transverse dynamics from ags to lhc energies @xcite and is therefore a reliable model for the flowing background medium .",
    "the diffusion of a `` heavy particles '' in a medium consisting of `` light particles '' can be described with help of a fokker - planck equation @xcite as an approximation of the collision term of the corresponding boltzmann equation .",
    "it can be mapped into an equivalent stochastic langevin equation , suitable for numerical simulations .",
    "the drag and diffusion coefficients for the heavy - quark propagation within this framework are taken from a resonance approach @xcite , where the existence of d - mesons and b - mesons in the qgp phase is assumed , as well as a @xmath4-matrix approach @xcite in which quark - antiquark potentials are used for the calculation of the coefficients in the qgp .",
    "the initial production of charm quarks in our approach is based on a glauber approach . for the realization of the initial collision dynamics we use the urqmd model .",
    "we perform a first urqmd run excluding interactions between the colliding nuclei and save the nucleon - nucleon collision space - time coordinates .",
    "these coordinates are used in a second , full urqmd run as possible production coordinates for the charm quarks .    as momentum distribution for the initially produced charm quarks at @xmath5 we use @xmath6 with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 and for bottom quarks",
    "@xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these distributions are taken from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution for charm quarks at @xmath13tev is obtained from a fit to pythia calculations . @xmath14 with the coefficients @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    starting with these distributions as initial conditions we propagate the heavy quarks at each hydro - timestep .",
    "we use the urqmd / hydro s cell velocities , the cell temperature , the size of the time - step , and the @xmath18-factor for the calculation of the momentum transfer , propagating all quarks independently .",
    "our approach provides us only with the heavy - quark distributions . since",
    "heavy quarks can not be measured directly in experiments we include a hadronization mechanism for d - mesons and b - mesons , via the use of a quark - coalescence mechanism . to implement this coalescence",
    "we perform our langevin calculation until the decoupling temperature is reached .",
    "subsequently we add the momenta of light quarks to those of the heavy quarks .",
    "first we performed our calculations in au+au collisions at @xmath5 in a centrality range of 20%-40% . to compare our results to the single - electron spectra measured by phenix we use pythia for the decay of the heavy quarks to heavy flavor electrons and apply a rapidity cut of @xmath19 .",
    "[ rhic ] ( left ) shows our results for the elliptic flow @xmath0 . for a decoupling temperature of @xmath20",
    "we obtain a reasonable agreement with the experimental data except for low @xmath3 bins . here",
    "a depletion effect can be seen .",
    "this effect is due to the radial velocity of the medium , which is in case of a developed elliptic flow larger in @xmath21 than in @xmath22 direction .",
    "consequently there is a depletion of particles with high @xmath23 in the low @xmath3 region and smaller elliptic flow .",

    "to summarize , we presented in this letter our results on the medium modification of heavy quarks at rhic and lhc energies using the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 and the elliptic flow @xmath0 as observables . at rhic energies we compared different sets for drag and diffusion coefficients and obtained the best agreement to experimental measurements if using a resonance model with a decoupling temperature of @xmath26 . at lhc",
    "we compared a coalescence approach and a fragmentation approach as hadronization mechanism using the resonance model at a decoupling temperature of @xmath26 .",
    "both approaches describe the ellitpic flow @xmath0 in pretty good agreement with the experimental data while for the @xmath1 a major disagreement between our models at low @xmath3 can be seen that needs to be resolved by new measurements .",
