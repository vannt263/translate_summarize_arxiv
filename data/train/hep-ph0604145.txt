    "there is a need among the experimental design community for the ability to accurately predict backgrounds from cosmic ray muons at relatively shallow depths  less than a few hundreds of meters of water equivalent ( m.w.e . ) . in the past",
    ", most studies have focused on muon fluxes and intensities at very deep sites ( greater than 1 km.w.e . ) which do not accurately predict the behavior of muons below a few hundred gev . since",
    "shallow sites are dominated by muons between 320 gev , the characteristic distributions of these muons can have a great impact on the designs of experimental laboratories and shielding geometries .    the momentum distribution of the vertical muon intensity ( @xmath0 [ @xmath1 sr@xmath2 s@xmath2 gev@xmath3 ) at the surface is fairly well known , as many experiments have provided measurements . however , when calculating the total rate of muons for a given shielding configuration , it is the interplay between the angular distribution of muons as a function of momentum and the angular distribution of shielding and overburden which is important .",
    "while it is generally accepted@xcite that the muon angular distribution is @xmath4 for low muon momenta of around 3 gev , and that at higher momenta ( @xmath5 100200 gev ) it approaches a @xmath6 distribution ( for @xmath7 ) , there is currently no simple way to accurately estimate the muon momentum spectra over _ all _ angles .    in this work ,",
    "experimental data in which muon momentum distributions have been recorded at various zenith angles have been compared .",
    "a simple relationship has been found , @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "[ f - bestfit ] ) .",
    "it relates all angles to the differential vertical muon intensity distribution @xmath9 by simply scaling the independant variable ( momentum ) by @xmath10 and the dependant variable ( @xmath11 ) by @xmath12 .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of this intriguing universality remains unclear .",
    "an improved fit is provided which should allow surface muon intensity predictions over all zenith angles for the momentum range of most relevance to shallow sites : @xmath13gev and @xmath14gev/@xmath10 .",
    "before analysing the data , some brief comments on the selection criteria are required .",
    "an attempt was made to include as much surface muon data at various zenith angles as possible .",
    "a majority of the available cosmic - ray muon data was recorded at underground locations .",
    "since these data are usually reported after slant - depth corrections which inherently assume certain zenith angle dependancies , it was decided to exclude all data recorded at depth . additionally , surface experiments for which the angular acceptance was not clearly specified or the systematic errors were not discussed were not included in this study .",
    "the selected data , shown in table  [ t - exp ] , come from six surface muon experiments which measured intensity as a function of muon momentum and zenith angle .",
    "they span zenith angles from the vertical to the horizontal and cover muon momenta up to  2000 gev/@xmath10 .",
    ".the six experimental data sets that were included in this study .",
    "for each experiment , the ranges in energy and angular acceptance are shown for the individual data sets . when comparing data sets , the average value of @xmath15 was used . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     recall that this improved parameterization applies to _ all _ zenith angles .",
    "given the available data , it can be considered valid for muon momenta @xmath16 gev and @xmath14 gev/@xmath10 .",
    "an examination of experimental data on muon intensities for various zenith angles at the surface has been performed . within that data , a simple relationship has been found between the angular distribution and the vertical momentum spectrum of @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "one wonders if it is perhaps significant that @xmath19 is the component of the muon momentum perpendicular to the surface .",
    "nevertheless , for the purpose of simulating muon intensities near the surface , this relation appears remarkably accurate .",
    "the highest accuracy was achieved when using the functional form from @xcite and adjusting the coefficients as described above ( the result is labeled `` best fit '' in table  [ t - chi2 ] and fig .",
    "[ f - bestfit ] ) . for simulations in which energies of a few tens of gev are important ( less than 100 m.w.e . )",
    ", it is recommended to use this modified fit . at greater depths , where the energies below 10 gev can safely be neglected ,",
    "the original parameters listed in @xcite would probably be preferred , since they provide a smooth transition to higher values of @xmath19 .",
    "although it was not studied in this work , it might be an interesting exercise to validate the angular correlation of eq .",
    "[ e - intensity ] at higher energies .",
    "the author would like to acknowledge the assistance of xiangyu ding from the illinois math and science academy for his assistance in finding useful data and initial efforts in data comparison and fitting .",
