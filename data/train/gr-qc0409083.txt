    "the initial gravitational - wave detectors in the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) are now near design sensitivity and are taking science data @xcite .",
    "the interferometers will be upgraded to a much more sensitive _ advanced - ligo _ design beginning in about 2007 . until 2003 ,",
    "the baseline design for advanced ligo used nearly flat but spherical mirrors in its arm cavities . however , in 2003 , sidles and sigg @xcite showed that these mirrors experience a strong tilt instability : when the mirrors are tilted symmetrically , the light beam slides across their surfaces to an off - center location and its light pressure then pushes hard to increase the tilt . sidles and sigg proposed switching to mirrors that are segments of nearly concentric spheres ( radii of curvature slightly larger than half the cavity length ) ; such mirrors , they showed , can support gaussian beams of the same ( large ) radius as the baseline design , while experiencing a much weakened tilt instability .",
    "this triggered a change of the baseline design for advanced ligo to nearly concentric , spherical mirrors .",
    "gaussian beams have the serious disadvantage that , because of their steep intensity gradient over most of the beam s area , they average poorly over the fluctuating bumps and valleys on the mirrors surfaces that are caused by thermal fluctuations ( _ thermoelastic noise _ ) . oshaughnessy and thorne @xcite have proposed improving the averaging and thereby reducing the thermoelastic noise substantially , by replacing the arm cavities gaussian beams by flat - topped beams ( _ mesa beams _ , as willems has named them ) , which are supported by nearly flat , mexican - hat - shaped mirrors .",
    "oshaughnessy , strigin and vyatchanin @xcite have shown that the thermoelastic noise for mesa beams is three times weaker in noise power than for the baseline gaussian beams ( with beam sizes that produce the same diffraction losses ) , and correspondingly that the mesa - beam interferometers could see farther into the universe , producing event rates for inspiraling binaries about three times higher than the baseline gaussian - beam design .",

    "@xcite have shown that the nearly flat mesa - beamed mirrors are practical in all respects that could be analyzed theoretically , and dambrosio , desalvo , simoni and willems @xcite are building a prototype optical cavity with mesa beams , to explore practical issues experimentally .",
    "unfortunately , the nearly flat , mexican - hat - shaped mirrors ( `` fm '' ) proposed by oshaugnessy and thorne to support mesa beams ( sec .  [ sec : fm ] below ) , like the nearly flat , spherical mirrors of the pre-2003 baseline design , experience a severe tilt instability ( vyatchanin @xcite ; savov and vyatchanin @xcite ) . in this paper , motivated by the sidles - sigg result that , for gaussian beams and spherical mirrors , the tilt instability is greatly weakened by switching from nearly flat to nearly concentric mirrors , we propose ( sec .
