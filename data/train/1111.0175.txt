    "the helfrich hamiltonian involves four parameters : the spontaneous curvature @xmath3 , the surface tension @xmath4 , the bending modulus @xmath5 , and the saddle - splay modulus @xmath6 . for symmetric bilayer membranes , @xmath7 .",
    "if , in addition , the discussion is limited to deformations that preserve the topology of the membrane , then ( by virtue of the gauss - bonnet theorem ) the total energy associated with the last term is a constant , and one arrives to the more simple form @xmath8 = \\sigma_0 a+\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_0 j^2 , \\label{eq : helfhamiltonian2}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the total area of the membrane and @xmath10 , defined by @xmath11 , is the integrated total curvature .",
    "the surface tension appearing in eq.([eq : helfhamiltonian2 ] ) is known as the `` intrinsic tension '' .",
    "it represents the elastic energy required to increase the surface of the membrane by a unit area , and can be identified with the derivative of the energy with respect to the area @xmath9 , @xmath12 , at constant @xmath10 . as this quantity",
    "is not directly measurable , its physical meaning is still a matter of a fierce debate . in molecular simulations , one can attach the membrane to a `` frame '' and measure the `` mechanical ( frame ) tension '' , @xmath13 , which is the lateral force per unit length exerted on the boundaries of the membrane @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the mechanical tension is routinely measured by micropipette aspiration of vesicles @xcite .",
    "formally , the mechanical tension is obtained by taking the full derivative of the _ free energy _",
    "@xmath14 with respect to the frame ( projected ) area : @xmath15 @xcite . from a comparison of the above definitions of @xmath4 and @xmath13 ,",
    "it becomes clear that the intrinsic and mechanical tensions are different quantities .",
    "contrary the former , the latter is a thermodynamic quantity that also depends on the entropy of the membrane .",
    "bilayer membranes usually exhibit relatively large thermal undulations at room temperature @xcite and , indeed , their mechanical tension also includes an entropic contribution due to the suppression of the amplitude of the undulations upon increasing the projected area .",
    "the surface tension can be also measured indirectly by recording and analyzing the statistics of the membrane height fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the analysis is based on the so called monge parametrization , where the surface of the fluctuating membrane is represented by a height function , @xmath16 , above the frame @xmath17 plane .",
    "the helfrich hamiltonian does not have a simple form when expressed in terms of @xmath16 .",
    "however , for a nearly flat membrane , i.e. , when the derivatives of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20 are small ( @xmath21 ) , one obtains the quadratic approximation @xmath22 .",

    "the quadratic approximation can be diagonalized by introducing the fourier transformation : @xmath23 . in fourier space",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath24 and by invoking the equipartition theorem , we find that the mean square amplitude of mode @xmath25 ( `` spectral intensity '' ) : @xmath26 from the last result , it seems as if @xmath4 can be extracted from the fluctuation spectrum of the membrane .",
    "results of both fully - atomistic and coarse - grained simulation @xcite show that spectral intensity can indeed be fitted to the form @xmath27 however , the derivation of eq.([eq : equipart ] ) is based on the approximated hamiltonian @xmath28 and , therefore , it is not a - priory clear why the so called `` @xmath29-coefficient '' appearing in eq.([eq : q2coef ] ) , @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , some theoretical studies have argued that the @xmath29 coefficient is actually equal to the mechanical tension @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this conclusion has been rejected more recently in favor of the more common interpretation that @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "membrane simulations carried at fixed mechanical tension ( usually performed for @xmath31 ) tend to agree with the result that @xmath32 @xcite , but simulations that show the opposite @xmath33 also exist @xcite . in this paper",
    "we settle this problem and prove , analytically and computationally , that the correct result is indeed @xmath32 .",
    "much of the confusion associated with the physical meaning of surface tension in membranes is related to fact that the concept of surface tension has been originally defined for an interface between bulk phases ( e.g. , between water and oil ) @xcite . in its original context",
    ", the surface tension represents the access free energy @xmath34 per unit area @xmath9 of the interface between the bulk phases @xmath35 when the concept of surface tension is introduced into the theory of bilayer membranes , its meaning is distorted due to the following two major differences between membranes and interfaces of bulk phases    1 .",
    "in the case of bulk phases , it is often assumed that the interface between them is flat .",
    "there is usually very little interest in the thermal roughness of the interface , unless it is very soft .",
    "in contrast , bilayer membranes are treated as highly fluctuating surfaces whose elastic response is very much influenced by the entropy associated with the thermal fluctuations .",
    "the changes in the areas of both systems arise from very different origins . in the case of , say , a water - oil interface ,",
    "the changes in the interfacial area are _ not _ produced by elastic deformations ( dilation / compression ) that modify the molecular densities of the bulk phases .",
    "instead , they result from transfer of molecules between the bulk phases and the interface occurring , for instance , when the shape of the container is changed .",
    "the surface tension @xmath36 is essentially a chemical potential which is directly related to the exchange parameter between the coexisting phases @xcite .",
    "the case of bilayer membranes is completely different . here",
    ", there is an exchange of water between the bulk fluid and interfacial region , but almost no exchange of _ lipid _ material because the concentration of free lipids in the embedding solution is extremely low ( @xmath37 m @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , there is no reservoir of lipids outside of the bilayer and , therefore , a changes in the bilayer area result in a change in the area density of the lipids .",
    "the membrane surface tension measures the response to this elastic deformation , including the indirect contribution due to the exchange of water between the bilayer and solution resulting from the deformation ( which has influence on the effective elastic moduli ) .",
    "most earlier theoretical investigations of membranes involved the assumption that the area per lipid @xmath38 is constant .",
    "this assumption relies on the observation that the energy cost involved in density fluctuations is much larger than the energy scale associated with curvature fluctuations . further assuming that the lipids are insoluble in water ( and , therefore",
    ", they all reside on the membrane where their number @xmath39 is constant ) implies that the total area of the membrane @xmath40 is constant . if that is the case , then why does one need to include this constant in the helfrich hamiltonian [ first term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : helfhamiltonian2 ] ) ] , and what does the coefficient , @xmath4 , represent ?",
    "the answer is simple .",
    "it is technically very hard to calculate analytically the partition function for a fluctuating manifold with a fixed area @xmath9 . the first term in eq.([eq : helfhamiltonian2 ] )",
    "is a lagrange multiplier that fixes the mean area @xmath41 of the membrane , and the value of @xmath4 is set by the requirement that @xmath42 . as usual",
    ", it is assumed that in the thermodynamic limit the relative fluctuations in the total area become negligible , and there is no distinction between @xmath41 and @xmath9 .",
    "the renewed interest in the meaning of surface tension during the past decade is very much linked with the rapid development in computer modeling and simulations of bilayer membranes . in molecular simulations",
    "the number of lipids @xmath39 is usually fixed , but the total area in not .",
    "membranes are no longer treated as incompressible thin films , but rather as stretchable / compressible surfaces whose elastic response result from their intermolecular forces . with this point of view in mind , it is clear that the intrinsic tension @xmath4 in helfrich hamiltonian represents an elastic coefficient which , potentially , may be related to the mechanical tension @xmath13 .",
    "there is , of course , no reason to expect that the elastic energy @xmath43 of the membrane is linear in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "a quadratic elastic function @xmath44 seems like a more appropriate form , where @xmath45 is the stretching / compression modulus and @xmath46 is the relaxed area of the membrane @xcite ( also known as schulman s area @xcite ) . expressing the total area as the sum of the projected and undulations areas @xmath47 , and assuming that @xmath48 , yields the linear approximation @xmath49 from which one identifies that @xmath50 . the assumption that @xmath48 becomes increasingly accurate at high tensions ; but ,",
    "nevertheless , the linear relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath9 is used in eq.([eq : helfhamiltonian2 ] ) over the entire range of intrinsic tensions .",
    "the proof that @xmath32 consists of three steps and involves the introduction of two additional surface tensions : ( i ) @xmath51 , the renormalized surface tension , and ( ii ) @xmath52 , the _ out - of - plane _ shear modulus ( which , as it will turn out below , is also a surface tension ) .",
    "let us first understand what these two quantities represent .",
    "the out - of - plane shear modulus @xmath52 is the force per unit length required to introduce the deformation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) from the initial reference state depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .",
    "this deformation is achieved by applying opposite normal forces on boundaries of the membrane .",
    "( notice that the out - of - plane shear deformation changes the area of the membrane , but preserves the volume of the three - dimensional euclidean metric .",
    "we will revisit this point later in section [ sec : rotational ] . )",
    "the shear modulus is _ not _ related to the deformation of a specific configuration but rather to the deformation of a fluctuating membrane .",
    "the out of plane shear is a special case of a more general family of elastic deformations resulting from the action of normal stress fields .",
    "a representative of this family of deformations is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) .",
    "mathematically , such deformations can be characterized by the mean height profile of the membrane : @xmath53 .",
    "this function , which vanishes in the undeformed reference state @xmath54 , serves as the strain field that describes arbitrary deformations of the fluctuating membrane at fixed projected area @xmath55 . specifically for the shear deformation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the shear strain . the normal stress field associated with the strain function @xmath58",
    "can be derived from the elastic free energy @xmath59 .",
    "based on the same physical arguments used to justify the introduction of helfrich effective hamiltonian eq.([eq : helfhamiltonian2 ] ) , we hereby assume that the elastic free energy @xmath59 can be written in a similar form @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the total area and integrated total curvature of the mean height profile of the membrane , @xmath58 . our conjecture of eq.([eq : helffree ] ) is based on the fact ( which will be proved in the following section [ sec : lrt ] ) that this form of the free energy yields the experimentally and computationally well established eq.([eq : q2coef ] ) for the spectral intensity .",
    "the coefficient @xmath51 and @xmath63 appearing in eq.([eq : helffree ] ) are the _",
    "renormalized _ surface tension and bending rigidity .",
    "these quantities are thermodynamic properties of the membranes which , in general , include entropic contributions and , therefore , are different than the corresponding microscopic coefficients appearing in the helfrich effective hamiltonian .      the first step in the proof that @xmath32 is to show that @xmath64 , which follows from static linear response theory .",
    "detailed proof of this point can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we provide a short version of the derivation .",
    "let us consider an elastic deformation with a function @xmath58 that satisfies periodic boundary conditions ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:1](d ) ) . introducing @xmath65 , the fourier transform of the function @xmath58 , and expanding @xmath66 and @xmath67 in powers of @xmath65 , we find @xmath68\\bar{h}_q\\bar{h}_{-q } + { \\cal o}\\left(|\\bar{h}_q|^4\\right ) \\label{eq : fourierfree}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 since the function @xmath58 is real @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the hamiltonian of the membrane .",
    "notice that we do not need to know the specific form of @xmath71 and , in particular , we do not assume here that @xmath72 is necessarily the helfrich hamiltonian eq.([eq : helfhamiltonian2 ] ) or its quadratic approximation eq.([eq : mongehamiltonian ] ) .",
    "instead , we assume that the free energy is given by eq.([eq : helffree ] ) [ or by its fourier space counterpart eq.([eq : fourierfree ] ) ] ; and as we shall now show , this is the key assumption that ultimately leads to eq.([eq : q2coef ] ) .",

    "having demonstrated that @xmath90 , the last step in the proof that @xmath32 is to show that @xmath91 .",
    "this follows immediately from the invariance of helfrich free energy eq.([eq : helffree ] ) with respect to rigid transformations . specifically , the sheared membrane which is replotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , can be rotated ( see fig .  [ fig:2](c ) ) so that the mean profile of the deformed membrane lies in the @xmath17 plane defined by the undeformed state ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) ) . in this orientation @xmath92 , and from eq.([eq : helfshear2 ] ) one gets that the free energy cost of imposing the deformation in fig .",

    "one finds that the mechanical tension @xmath94 .",
    "while eq.([eq : frametens1 ] ) is correct , it misses an important issue which can not be captured within the framework of helfrich model that treats the membrane as a 2d manifold with no 3d volume . in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a)-(c ) we have intentionally drawn the membranes as thin films , which highlights a very important point . the transition from the reference state ( a ) to the deformed state ( c ) is achieved via a sequence of two volume - preserving transformations - shear followed by rotation .",
    "therefore , the reference state and the deformed one have different areas but the same volume , which means that in eq.([eq : frametens1 ] ) one must take the derivative at a constant volume : @xmath95 experimentally and computationally , there is no practical way to fix or even determine the volume of a bilayer at the molecular resolution .",
    "this , however , does not render the above argument irrelevant to lipid bilayer membranes .",
    "the membrane and the embedding fluid medium are placed in a `` container '' whose volume can be easily controlled .",
    "eq.([eq : frametens2 ] ) states that the frame tension of the bilayer can be measured by changing the cross - sectional area of the container while keeping its volume fixed .",
    "this tension is associated with the entire `` interfacial region '' of the system that includes both the bilayer of lipids as well as the hydration layers of structured water around the bilayer .",
    "the fluid bulk water has no elastic response to volume preserving deformations and , therefore , it make no contribution to @xmath13 .    the fact that @xmath13 is associated with a volume preserving deformation is important .",
    "the reader may have noticed that in eq.([eq : frametens1 ] ) we wrote @xmath96 , while in eq.([eq : frametens2 ] ) we preferred the equality @xmath97 .",
    "obviously , the latter is also correct since , as discussed above in section [ sec : shear ] , @xmath84 . in writing @xmath97 in eq.([eq : frametens2 ] ) we wish to emphasize the fact that the frame tension is also a shear modulus .",
    "it represents the response of the system to `` pure shear '' deformations ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) ) , which is the same as the response to `` simple shear '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ) .",
    "the modulus of pure shear can be derived by considering the free energy cost associated with changing the dimensions of a system from @xmath98 to @xmath99\\times [ l_y(1+\\epsilon)]\\times [ l_z/(1+\\epsilon)^2]$ ] .",
    "the expansion of the free energy density in powers of @xmath57 reads @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the pressure along the @xmath102-th cartesian axis . due to the deformation ,",

    "eq.([eq : frame4 ] ) is known as the mechanical definition of the surface tension @xcite .      at this point",
    "only one question is left : why does one get @xmath30 rather than @xmath32 when dealing with the quadratic approximation of the effective surface hamiltonian , eq.([eq : mongehamiltonian ] ) ?",
