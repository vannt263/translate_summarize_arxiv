    "four dimensional @xmath0 gauged supergravity coupled to @xmath1-vector multiplets admits regular , static , bps black holes which are asympotic to @xmath3 . for very particular choices of prepotential ,",
    "gauging parameters and background charges , there exists a remarkable analytic solution @xcite due to cacciatori and klemm ( ck ) .",
    "these solutions can have spherical , flat or hyperbolic horizon geometries - hypermultiplets and there is also a rich solution space @xcite but in the current work we will restrict our focus to vector - multiplets .",
    "there has been some futher study of these ck solutions as well as related non - bps @xmath3 black holes @xcite ] and can be interpreted in m - theory as m2-branes wrapped on riemann surfaces @xcite .",
    "to understand the structure of these new black holes we find it quite useful to compare with the much better understood , asymptotically flat , single - center , bps black holes in @xmath0 ungauged supergravity @xcite .",
    "these asymptotically flat black holes preserve eight supercharges at infinity , four along the bulk of the solution and eight again at the horizon where the usual enhancement occurs . while the scalar fields are unfixed at infinity , they are typically fixed at the horizon giving rise to the moniker _ attractor mechanism_.    for the black hole solutions of @xmath0 gauged supergravity relevant to the current work , the asymptotic @xmath3 region will preserve all eight supercharges , while along the bulk of the solution just two will be preserved and this is enhanced to four supercharges at the horizon .",
    "the vector - multiplet scalars will tend to be fixed at infinity as well as at the horizon , albeit to different values ; giving rise to a varying effective cosmological constant .    whereas ungauged @xmath0 supergravity is _ invariant _ under an action of @xmath4",
    ", the gauged theory should be _ covariant _ under this action of the symplectic group . to enforce this covariance , one should work in a formalism which allows for magnetic gaugings .",
    "this is a somewhat complicated issue , the basic idea is that one can introduce magnetic gauge fields along with auxiliary tensor fields @xcite but having said that , the explicit component lagrangian of @xmath0 gauged supergravity with both magnetic and electric gaugings has not been written out .",
    "it should nonetheless be possible to extract the relevant formulae from @xcite . in this work",
    "we follow the pragmatic approach of @xcite and work with a theory which is a straightforward symplectic completion of @xcite .    using this symplectically covariant formalism",
    "we solve the algebraic bps equations for horizon geometries of the form @xmath5 with arbitrary electric and magnetic charges within a theory constructed from a general cubic prepotential .",
    "schematically , the horizon equations express the charges and gauging parameters in terms of the scalar fields and metric components , a solution to this system constitutes inverting these and solving for the scalar fields and metric components in terms of the charges and gaugings . in ungauged supergravity , black hole horizons in theories with a general cubic prepotential were first systematically studied by shmakova @xcite where an implicit solution was provided up to set of @xmath1 real quadratic equations for @xmath1 variables .",
    "in addition , when @xmath6 , an explicit solution was obtained .",
    "this has been extended in @xcite where the explicit solution was found for situations where the special khler manifold is a symmetric space , the final answer being s_bh= where @xmath7 is the quartic invariant .",
    "the general solution obtained in the current work for black hole horizons in gauged @xmath0 supergravity is implicit up to a set of @xmath1-holomorphic quadratic equations in @xmath1-complex variables . due to this holomorphicity ,",
    "the solutions space is non - empty and at least zero - dimensional .",
    "these equations can also be explicitly solved when the special khler manifold is symmetric , giving rise to an analytic solution for the scalar fields and the entropy .",
    "we find that the entropy is related to , but not equal to , the quartic invariant @xmath8 .",
    "our solution for the entropy depends on both the charges and the gaugings .",
    "we also find an explicit solution when both one magnetic charge and one magnetic gauging parameter vanish p^0=0 ,  p^0=0 .",
    "it is of significant interest to show generally that these horizon solutions can be continued to the uv and connected to a bps @xmath3 vacuum .",
    "there is currently no general analytic solution like the ungauged case , nonetheless we construct numerically a particular example of interest , that which corresponds to an internally spinning m2-brane wrapped on @xmath9 in a calabi - yau fivefold .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2 .",
    "we introduce the ansatz and review the bps equations for horizon solutions .",
    "we derive a form of the equations which is particularly amenable to solution and expand these equations for a general cubic prepotential . in section 3",
    "we solve the bps equations and consider in more detail the solution for symmetric special khler manifiolds .",
    "we present the canonical stu mode example which can be embedded in m - theory .",
    "we also numerically compute a particular dyonic black hole which corresponds to a spinning m2 brane wrapped on a riemann surface in a calabi - yau fivefold .",
    "we largely follow the conventions of @xcite but here we repeat the four dimensional black hole ansatz : [ ansatz ] ds_4 ^ 2&= & e^2u dt^2- e^-2u dr^2- e^2(v - u ) ( d^2+h()^2 d^2 ) [ metansatz ] + a^&= & ^(r ) dt- p^(r ) f ( ) d , with h()=\\ { : & s^2  ( = 1 ) + : & ^2  ( = -1 ) . and the scalar fields are radially dependant @xmath10 .",

    "the level of detail of our solution is essentially equivalent to the state of the art for ungauged supergravity but it is curious that our set of quadratic equations are holomorphic whereas the similar equations in the ungauged case are real .",

    "it would seem that a reasonable strategy to understand black holes in gauged supergravity would be to continue to utilize the many tools which have been put to good use in the ungauged theory , much as we have done in this paper .",
    "the study of higher derivative corrections in the gauged case presents a formidable challenge .    by the general principles of holography , it is desirable to embed these black holes into a uv complete theory of gravity such as string or m - theory , but currently the only known embedding is for the particular stu - model discussed in section [ sec : mtheory ] . while it would certainly be a welcome development to derive quite general models of gauged supergravity with vector multiplets from m - theory , in lieu of that",
    ", it is natural to include hypermultiplets where there is a richer set of known embeddings ( one can find numerous explicit examples in @xcite ) . studying m - theory enbeddings might help understand the physical meaning behind the combinations @xmath36 .",
    "these are a combination of charges , which specify the vacuum selection sector and gauging parameters which appear in the action and define the theory .",
    "the pairing does not appear to be so natural , it would be nice to have a physical understanding of why the bps equations have a neat form when this combination are used .    in this work we have largely focussed on the horizon geometries but it would be quite helpful to have a general proof that such horizons can be uv completed to an @xmath0 , @xmath3 solution . in the case of the ck black holes where an analytic solution is at hand , one can easily check that the range of magnetic charges for which a regular black hole exists is identical to the range of charges for which a horizon geometry exists .",
    "one can thus conclude that the ck solution space exhausts the space of magnetic black holes in that particular gauged supergravity theory .",
    "it would be a significant development to have analytic solutions for more general dyonic black holes much like the general solution is known in ungauged supergravity .",

    "<S> our solution is implicit up to a set of holomorphic quadratic equations . </S>",
    "<S> for particular models which have known embeddings in m - theory , we derive new horizon geometries with dyonic charges and numerically construct black hole solutions . these correspond to m2-branes wrapped on a riemann surface in a local calabi - yau five - fold with internal spin .    nick halmagyi + 0.5 cm laboratoire de physique thorique et hautes energies , + universit pierre et marie curie , cnrs umr 7589 , + f-75252 paris cedex 05 , france + 0.5 cm halmagyi@lpthe.jussieu.fr +    _ dedicated to the loving memory of sue halmagyi _ </S>"
