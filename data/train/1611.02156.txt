    "attempts and discussions have been proposed for the study of vector mesons in nuclear medium from the theoretical and experimental sides up to now @xcite .",
    "the analyses of the pion - nucleus system suggest partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium ; the pion decay constant , the order parameter of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , is expected to be reduced about 35% at the normal nuclear density @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar meson @xmath0 is another candidate to probe such a change of the vacuum property .",
    "its mass is larger than other low - lying pseudoscalar mesons , such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , due to the chiral symmetry breaking in the three - flavor system @xcite together with the u@xmath6(1 ) anomaly in qcd @xcite .",

    "the analyses of the @xmath0 transparency ratio suggest a small imaginary part of the @xmath0 optical potential @xcite .    by now",
