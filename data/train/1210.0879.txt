    "the question of survivability of planets during post - main - sequence evolution of the host star has attracted some interest over the past years @xcite . recently , many substellar companions have been discovered in close orbits around evolved stars ( table  [ tab : systems ] ) .",
    "@xcite detected a 0.053  m@xmath0  brown dwarf orbiting the 0.39  m@xmath0  white dwarf wd 0137 - 349 with a 1.9-hour period .",
    "a likely brown dwarf was discovered in a 2.3-hour orbit around the subdwarf b star sdss j08205 + 0008 @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered a jupiter - mass object orbiting the red horizontal branch star hip 13044 with a 16.2-day period .",
    "finally , @xcite reported the detection of two nearly earth - sized planets orbiting the subdwarf b star kic 05807616 with orbital periods of 5.8 and 8.2 hours .",
    "the existence of these systems for which the radius of the precursor of the primary was larger than today s orbital separation , suggests that they have gone through a common envelope ( ce ) interaction . during this phase ,",
    "the companion is engulfed by its host star s envelope when the latter was a giant star @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics simulations of this evolutionary phase have been performed with different numerical techniques @xcite but questions persist .",
    "it is still unclear how the envelope of the donor star gets ejected , and why the final separations obtained by simulations are larger than those observed in post - ce systems @xcite .",
    "the resolution reached in these numerical models currently does not suffice to study the complete evolution for a substellar companion that may spiral down to very close to the giant s core .",
    "an important question is therefore whether substellar companions can survive engulfment by the giant s envelope without being totally disrupted .",
    "a system with a very low mass companion has a very small orbital energy budget , so we may also plausibly conjecture that a ce in such a system would more likely fail and result in a merger , thus destroying the companion .",
    "is it therefore possible that substellar companions started off as more massive objects , which were then partially disrupted during their engulfment to become the objects we see today ?",
    "this scenario was actually suggested by @xcite to explain the existence of planets around kic 05807616 .",
    "@xcite studied the disruption of gravitationally bound objects by direct action of ram pressure in the context of star formation and galaxy evolution . however",
    "the physics of disruption is scale free , so their results also apply to other astrophysical questions such as the gas stripping occurring in clustered galaxies @xcite or here , the disruption of hydrostatic companions captured by the envelope of a giant star . in this contribution",
    "we use their theory to determine whether , in the observed systems , the substellar companions could have lost a significant amount of mass during the in - spiral phase .",
    "we describe the formalism used in section  [ sec : analysis ] and present the results in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we provide a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "@xcite calculated the conditions for a self - gravitating , hydrostatic , isothermal sphere moving in an ambient medium to be disrupted by ram pressure .",
    "the disruption of an object by ram pressure can most simply be understood by the pancake model @xcite , in which transverse motions are driven by the increased pressure on the front surface of the object compared to the sides .",
    "@xcite showed that the actual disruption by kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities with wavelengths comparable to the size of the object reproduces the scalings yielded by this simple model . @xcite",
    "confirmed numerically that when self - gravity is strong enough to stabilize the kelvin - helmholtz instability , the sphere is stable against catastrophic disruption .",
    "this occurs when the gravitational acceleration @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the background density , and the density , radius and relative velocity of the companion , respectively .",
    "we assume the tidal forces exerted by the giant star on the companion to be negligible compared with the self - gravity of the companion ",
    "we discuss this point in section  [ subsubsec : soker ] . assuming @xmath6 and taking the gravitational acceleration @xmath7 , one obtains a critical mass under which disruption occurs ( their equation  2.8 ) : @xmath8 if the configuration is unstable ( @xmath9 ) , the companion is disrupted in a crossing time as the characteristic timescale for destruction is equivalent to its internal dynamical timescale : @xmath10    we approximate the relative velocity of the companion by the maximum orbital velocity reached during the in - spiral phase , i.e. the final orbital velocity :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the mass of the primary s core , and @xmath13 is the orbital separation at the end of the ce phase .",
    "we substitute this relation in equation  ( [ eq : mcrit ] ) , and obtain the critical background density above which the companion is unstable :    @xmath14    one should emphasize that if the companion is unstable , the dominant wavelength acting to destroy it is comparable to the sphere radius .",
    "the destruction is therefore global and not quasi - static . in other words ,",
    "the companion is destroyed catastrophically , not ablated by incremental mass - loss due to short wavelength surface instabilities .",
    "thus stability can not be reached again once disruption starts .",
    "if the companion is stable ( @xmath15 ) , such shorter wavelength instabilities can still occur and strip mass in a more ablative manner , giving a quasi - static mass loss rate .",
    "we compute the largest unstable wavelength from equations ( [ eq : gcrit ] ) and ( [ eq : velocity ] ) , again assuming @xmath16 , and substituting @xmath17 for @xmath4 .",
    "we find    @xmath18    @xcite suggests that the corresponding mass loss rate can then be approximated to that occurring in laminar viscous flows as described by their equation  3.5 :    @xmath19    where we have assumed the relative velocity to be of the order of the sound speed of the background .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mdot_stable ] ) should be used with caution as it is valid only for reynolds numbers @xmath20 @xcite . in our case , the reynolds number is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the molecular viscosity .",
    "viscosity in stellar interiors is far too small to allow such low reynolds numbers on these length scales .",
    "however , such low effective reynolds numbers might be reached through the turbulent viscosity .",
    "since the largest possible size of the eddies is @xmath17 and their largest velocity is the sound speed of the ambient medium @xmath23 , one can use a formalism like that of @xcite and parametrize the turbulent viscosity as :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is a free parameter .",
    "the effective reynolds number is thus :    @xmath26    where we have still assumed that @xmath27 . unfortunately , no accepted value of @xmath28 has been derived for our specific case .",
    "we can only calculate the minimum turbulent reynolds number @xmath29 and see how this number compares to the range required to apply equation  ( [ eq : mdot_stable ] )",
    ".    another approach would be to calculate how much work from the drag acts on the companion during its in - spiral , and compare it to the companion s gravitational binding energy @xmath30 .",
    "assuming for the cross section @xmath31 and a drag coefficient @xmath32 , the drag force is @xmath33 .",
    "the smaller the companion , the longer the in - spiral phase lasts : for example , the 0.9  m@xmath0  and 0.1  m@xmath0  companions complete about 20 and 40 orbits during this phase , respectively @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that our companions complete at least 50 orbits , and slice the giant s envelope down to the currently observed separation of the system , in @xmath34 equally - spaced radii @xmath35 corresponding to an average density @xmath36 . assuming @xmath37 , the work provided by drag forces is thus :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the mass enclosed within @xmath35 .",
    "we will see in section  [ subsec : charpinet ] that the calculation of @xmath41 does not depend strongly on the number of assumed orbits .",
    "if @xmath42 we conclude that the companion could have been destroyed if the drag energy can be coupled to the interior of the companion efficiently , even if it is stable according to equation  ( [ eq : gcrit ] ) .",
    "in this section we study each system reported in table  [ tab : systems ] separately and investigate whether the substellar components are less massive today than they were prior to the ce evolution .      using the _ mesa _ stellar evolution code @xcite , we compute a model for the 0.053  m@xmath0  brown dwarf companion to this white dwarf and obtain a radius @xmath43  r@xmath0  ( figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "the mean density of the brown dwarf is @xmath44  g  @xmath45  which , substituted in equation  ( [ eq : rhocrit ] ) , yields a critical density @xmath46  g  @xmath45 .",
    "( solid black ) , 10  m@xmath47  ( dashed red ) , 1  m@xmath47  ( dash - dotted blue ) and 0.1  m@xmath47  ( dotted green ) models . [ fig : profiles ] ]    we compare this critical density to the density profile of the progenitor and see whether the companion will plunge deep enough into the primary s envelope to encounter a density high enough to destroy it",
    ". the most likely progenitor of the white dwarf is a nearly 1  m@xmath0  main sequence star .",
    "we evolve such a model with _ mesa _ up to the red giant branch until the core mass reaches the observed white dwarf mass . at that time , the radius of the star was 100  r@xmath0  and its total mass was 0.89  m@xmath0  due to mass loss .",
    "the density profile of this red giant star is displayed in figure  [ fig : progenitor ] .",
    "the current orbital separation of the system is @xmath48  r@xmath0   which means that the companion has reached a layer of the primary where the density @xmath49  g  @xmath45 .    at this point",
    ", we should emphasize that we have calculated the maximum density encountered by the companion using the _ initial _ profile of the giant primary .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations suggest that in the deep interior , density at a given coordinate decreases with time although the current resolution does not allow them to give a definitive answer at such small radii .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 should be considered an upper limit .",
    "@xmath50 is four orders of magnitude smaller than the critical density required for instability so we conclude that the companion is stable .",
    "moreover , the mass loss rate due to viscous stripping @xmath51  m@xmath47  yr@xmath52  only .",
    "since the dynamical phase of a ce lasts only about one year @xcite , the companion has not lost any significant amount of mass during its in - spiral phase .",
    "red giant star progenitor of wd 0137349 ( solid black ) and a 0.76  m@xmath0  star at the tip of the red giant branch ( dotted red ) . ]      sdss j08205 + 0008 is very similar to wd 0137349 so we also conclude that the brown dwarf  whose estimated mass ranges from 0.045 to 0.068  m@xmath0   has not been affected during the plunge - in phase .",
    "the minimum mass of the planet orbiting hip 13044 is estimated to be 1.25  m@xmath47  @xcite .",
    "this system is intriguing , as a plausible formation channel for this system has yet to be found .",
    "indeed , the orbital separation ( @xmath53  r@xmath0 ) is much larger than the separations obtained from numerical simulations or observations of post - ce systems @xcite .",
    "also , successful ce interactions usually lead to the formation of blue horizontal branch stars with very thin hydrogen - envelopes @xcite .",
    "@xcite therefore suggested that the helium flash occurring in a 0.9  m@xmath0  metal - poor red giant star could ignite hydrogen burning in a thick region at the bottom of the envelope .",
    "this deposition of energy would eventually lead to a dramatic inflation lasting about 100yr , during which the stellar radius could reach 700  r@xmath0 . the planet would then enter a `` half - failed , half - successful '' ce during which the orbital separation would shrink down to approximately 25  r@xmath0 , only 0.1  m@xmath0  would be lost by the system and the primary would evolve to the red part of the horizontal branch .",
    "this theory has several problems .",
    "first , there is no compelling evidence suggesting that red giant branch stars might suffer such a large and long - lasting expansion after the helium core flash . on the contrary simulations performed with stellar evolution codes such as _ mesa _ ,",
    "show that red giant stars shrink after helium has been ignited explosively . secondly , the duration of this suggested post - helium - flash expansion is larger than the duration of a ce phase .",
    "therefore , the in - spiral of the companion could not have been stopped because of the primary contracting below its roche lobe on a short timescale .",
    "thus , the entire envelope must have been lifted up , mostly in the equatorial plane @xcite , which raises thus the question of how a red horizontal branch star could eventually form .",
    "finally , the planetary companion would strongly interact with falling back material through gravitational drag . in that regard ,",
    "the large orbital separation observed is still perplexing .",
    "for all these reasons we believe that the scenario suggested by @xcite is unlikely .",
    "a careful investigation of the progenitor of hip 13044 seems quite complex and beyond the purposes of this paper .",
    "consequently we simply assume that the companion went through a ce interaction with an unknown progenitor . for the latter",
    ", we will consider the same profile as in section  [ subsec : maxted ] in order to give an indicative answer on the potential survival of the companion .    for the companion ,",
    "we consider a 1  m@xmath47  model ( figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) , with a radius @xmath54  r@xmath0  and a mean density @xmath55  g  @xmath45 .",
    "we find the critical density for stability @xmath56  g  @xmath45 .",
    "the density in the progenitor s profile corresponding to the observed separations between the subdwarf and the planet @xmath57  g  @xmath45 , almost 4 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath58 .",
    "we thus conclude that the companion is stable .",
    "the viscous mass loss rate is also negligible ( @xmath59  m@xmath47  yr@xmath52 ) so no mass will be ablated from the companion during the plunge - in phase .",
    "the most intriguing system is certainly kic 05807616 , which has two nearly earth - mass planets orbiting a subdwarf b star with an orbital separation of about 1.5  r@xmath0 . in order to constrain the mass of these planets prior to their engulfment",
    ", we use the same method as previously , with four different models ranging from 10  m@xmath47  down to 1  m@xmath60  ( figure  [ fig : progenitor ] ) . for the earth - sized model ,",
    "we use the accepted values for the earth ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as listed in table  [ tab : planets ]",
    ". we again assume the primary used in section  [ subsec : maxted ] for which we obtain @xmath61  g  @xmath45 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : planets ] .",
    "one can see that the critical density required to catastrophically destroy an earth - sized companion is about as large as the maximum density @xmath50 . in this regard , the 1  m@xmath60  companion could still be stable .",
    "however @xmath62  ergs , which is more than an order of magnitude larger than the gravitational binding energy of the companion ( table  [ tab : planets ] ) .",
    "@xmath41 does not strongly depend on the number of assumed orbits since changing this number to 20 or 100 changes @xmath41 by a factor 23 only .",
    "since the work provided by drag forces exceeds the binding energy of the companion , we conclude that the earth - sized companion may not survive the engulfment , if the energy can be effectively coupled to the planetary material .    from the same considerations , a 10  m@xmath47  companion is too massive to be affected in any way during its in - spiral phase ( table  [ tab : planets ] ) .",
    "for a 1  m@xmath47  companion , @xmath50 exceeds @xmath58 by almost an order of magnitude , so the secondary could be stable .",
    "however , @xmath63 exceeds @xmath41 by only a factor of 3 , which suggests that a significant amount of mass could be removed from the surface of the companion .",
    "a 0.1  m@xmath47  companion has a critical density an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , @xmath41 is about twenty times larger than the binding energy of the companion .",
    "together , these suggest that an 0.1  m@xmath47  object probably would be destroyed . using a more evolved model with a higher core mass @xmath64  m@xmath0   and @xmath65 ( the stellar radius @xmath66  r@xmath0 ) yields similar results ( figure  [ fig : progenitor ] , table  [ tab : planets ] ) we thus conclude that the progenitor of the planets likely had a mass of a few  m@xmath47 , supporting the suggestion made by@xcite .",
    "a legitimate question is whether mass accretion by the substellar companion is relevant . from a bondi - hoyle analysis ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  31 ) the accretion rate onto the 1  m@xmath47  object is only    @xmath67    we therefore conclude that mass accretion is negligible on the timescale of the ce interaction .",
    "@xcite also reached this conclusion in the case of more massive secondaries .",
    "they further argued that the mass accretion rate calculated from their simulations is even smaller than the one given by equation  ( [ eq : bh ] ) , mainly because tidal effects dominate the structure of the flow .",
    "@xcite propose a slightly different scenario for the formation of the two planets around kic 05807616 . instead of considering the dynamical effects occurring during the ce phase",
    ", they suggest that a massive giant planet was tidally destroyed after the end of the in - spiral phase and that the two planets are remnants of the disrupted metallic core . using their equation  1 with @xmath68 , the values given by @xcite , and our planetary models ( table  [ tab : planets ] ) , the tidal radius at which destruction occurs is @xmath69 and @xmath70  r@xmath0  for the 10 and 1  m@xmath47  objects , respectively .",
    "these qualitative values are still smaller than the observed separations of the planets ( see table  [ tab : systems ] ) so it is difficult to conclude whether these objects would be tidally destroyed .",
    "they also suggest that evaporation of the companion due to heating from the envelope might be important .",
    "they estimate the mass of the planet must be @xmath71  m@xmath47   in order to survive evaporation .",
    "the evaporation timescale depends on the efficiency of heat transfer , which is sensitive to mixing between the planetary atmosphere and the stellar convective envelope .",
    "we can not at present calculate this timescale with sufficient precision .",
    "we therefore do not know whether evaporation could dominate the dynamical effects we discuss in this study .",
    "nevertheless , the mass of the progenitor suggested by @xcite is consistent with ours .",
    "we have considered evolved stars found to have brown dwarfs or planets around them in close orbits , suggesting that these systems have gone through a ce interaction . using the criterion developed by @xcite",
    ", we have investigated the stability of these substellar companions against mass loss induced by kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "we have found that the substellar companions observed in wd 0137349 , sdss j08205 + 0008 and hip 13044 are very unlikely to have been affected during the in - spiral inside their giant progenitors .",
    "therefore , the masses of these objects currently observed are likely the same as prior to the ce phase . the two planets detected orbiting kic 05807616 , however , are not massive enough to have survived the engulfment unscathed . we have estimated the mass of the progenitor of these planets to be of order 1  m@xmath47 .",
    "the question that still has to be answered is how such low mass companions could have successfully unbound the entire envelope of the primary .",
