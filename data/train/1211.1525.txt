    "in this paper , we investigate asymptotic behavior of the empirical eigenvalues distribution of the _ partial transpose _ of the random _ quantum state _ ( positive semidefinite hermitian matrix of trace one ) .",
    "this problem originated from the field of _ quantum information theory _ in relation to detecting _",
    "entanglement _ in a bipartite system .",
    "non - entangled states , called _ separable _ states , are necessarily positive semidefinite after partial transpose @xcite , where the latter property is called _ positive partial transpose _ , abbreviated as _ ppt_. the converse statement is not true except for bipartite states on @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . here , the partial transpose is made by writing the bipartite matrix as a kronecker product and transposing each block .",
    "therefore , the generic eigenvalue distribution of the partial transpose of a random quantum state is interesting and especially the behavior of the minimal eigenvalue is important .",
    "mathematically , we investigate the following problem .",
    "take three complex vector spaces @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 and define @xmath7 for a uniformly random unit vector @xmath8 in the product space @xmath9 .",
    "space @xmath3 is called the _ environment _ , space @xmath10 is called the _ system _ , and individual spaces @xmath4 and @xmath5 correspond to individual parts of the bipartite system .",
    "we will present the details of this construction in section [ subsec : our - model ] .",
    "this way of inducing measure on mixed quantum states was investigated in @xcite .",
    "then , we study the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of its partial transpose @xmath11 where the transpose acts only on the space @xmath5 .",
    "although quantum states correspond to positive semidefinite hermitian matrices of trace one , aubrun in @xcite used the normal wishart matrix model to approximate a random quantum state .",
    "the trace of such a wishart matrix is a random variable which converges to one only asymptotically .",
    "aubrun showed that the empirical eigenvalues distribution converges to the semicircular distribution as the dimension of the spaces grow in such a way that @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "later , banica and nechita @xcite showed with the same model that the limiting distribution is the free difference of two free poisson distributions in the regime where the dimension @xmath14 of one of the parts of the system is fixed and the dimension @xmath15 of environment and the dimension @xmath16 of the other system grow proportionally .",
    "by contrast , we look into this problem more directly by considering the matrix @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a wishart matrix .",
    "since the trace @xmath19 is a @xmath20-random variable , independent from @xmath21 , the problem of calculating moments of ( the partial transpose of ) @xmath21 is reduced to calculating appropriate moments of the wishart matrix @xmath18 .",
    "this idea was sketched briefly already by aubrun ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.2 ) . in this way",
    "we obtain exact combinatorial formulas involving summation over the symmetric group .",
    "we find three natural types of geodesics in the cayley graph of the symmetric group which yield interesting asymptotic distributions .",
    "two of them correspond to the above mentioned cases ( @xcite and @xcite ) , and the remaining new case turns out to be related to the _ meander polynomials _",

    "<S> two of them correspond to the above two cases ; the third one turns out to be a new matrix model for the meander polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we prove the convergence to the semicircular distribution together with its extreme eigenvalues under weaker assumptions , and show large deviation bound for the latter . </S>"
