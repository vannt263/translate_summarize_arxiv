    "the first detection of hydrogen molecules in space came from a distinctive pattern of absorption features that appeared in a low resolution uv spectrum of @xmath12  per recorded by a spectrometer on a sounding rocket ( carruthers 1970 ) .",
    "starting with that pioneering discovery , the lyman and werner bands of h@xmath8 in the spectra of early - type stars have led us down a trail of new discoveries about this most abundant molecule in space .",
    "progressively more refined observations by the _ copernicus _ satellite have given us a fundamental understanding on this molecule s abundances in various diffuse cloud environments ( spitzer et al .",
    "1973 ; york 1976 ; savage et al .",
    "1977 ) , how rapidly it is created and destroyed in space ( jura 1974 ) , and the amount of rotational excitation that is found in different circumstances ( spitzer & cochran 1973 ; spitzer , cochran , & hirshfeld 1974 ; morton & dinerstein 1976 ) . the observed populations in excited rotational levels have in turn led to theoretical interpretations about how this excitation is influenced by such conditions as the local gas density , temperature and the flux of uv pumping radiation from nearby stars ( spitzer & zweibel 1974 ; jura 1975a , b ) . many of the highlights of these investigations have been reviewed by spitzer & jenkins ( 1975 ) and shull & beckwith ( 1982 ) .",
    "the lyman and werner bands of h@xmath8 can even be used to learn more about the properties of very distant gas systems whose absorption lines appear in quasar spectra ( foltz , chaffee , & black 1988 ; songaila & cowie 1995 ) , although the frequency of finding these h@xmath8 features is generally quite low ( levshakov et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "in addition to the general conclusions just mentioned , there were some intriguing details that came from the observations of uv absorption lines .",
    "the early surveys by the _ copernicus _",
    "satellite indicated that toward a number of stars the h@xmath8 features became broader as the rotational quantum number @xmath10 increased ( spitzer & cochran 1973 ; spitzer , cochran , & hirshfeld 1974 ) .",
    "an initial suggestion by spitzer & cochran ( 1973 ) was that the extra broadening of the higher @xmath10 levels could arise from new molecules that had a large kinetic energy that was liberated as they formed and left the grain surfaces .",
    "however , a more detailed investigation by spitzer & morton ( 1976 ) showed that , as a rule , the cases that exhibited the line broadening with increasing @xmath10 were actually composed of two components that had different rotational excitations and a velocity separation that was marginally resolved by the instrument . in general",
    ", they found that the component with a more negative radial velocity was relatively inconspicuous at low @xmath10 , but due to its higher rotation temperature it became more important at higher @xmath10 and made the composite profile look broader .    by interpreting the rotational populations from the standpoint of theories on collisional and uv pumping , spitzer & morton ( 1976 ) found a consistent pattern where the components with the most negative velocity in each case had extraordinarily large local densities and exposure to unusually high uv pumping fluxes .",
    "they proposed that these components arose from thin , dense sheets of h@xmath8-bearing material in the cold , compressed regions that followed shock fronts coming toward us .",
    "these fronts supposedly came from either the supersonic expansions of the stars h  ii regions or perhaps from the blast waves caused by supernova explosions in the stellar associations .",
    "now , some twenty years after the original investigations with the _ copernicus _ satellite , we have an opportunity to study once again the behavior of the h@xmath8 profiles , but this time with a wavelength resolution that can cleanly separate the components .",
    "we report here the results of an investigation of h@xmath8 toward @xmath0  ori  a , one of the stars studied earlier that showed the intriguing behavior with the h@xmath8 components discussed above . once again",
    ", the concept of the h@xmath8 residing in the dense gas behind a shock comes out as a central theme in the interpretation , but our description of the configuration given in ",
    "[ shock ] is very different from that offered by spitzer & morton ( 1976 ) .",
    "the lyman and werner band absorptions of h@xmath8 in the spectrum of @xmath0  ori  a were observed with the interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( imaps ) .",
    "imaps is an objective - grating echelle spectrograph that was developed in the 1980 s as a sounding rocket instrument ( jenkins et al .",
    "1988 , 1989 ) and was recently reconfigured to fly in orbit .",
    "it can record the spectrum of a star over the wavelength region 950@xmath11150  at a resolving power of about 200,000 .. ] this instrument flew on the orfeus - spas carrier launched on 12 september 1993 by the space shuttle flight sts-51 .",
    "jenkins , et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have presented a detailed description of imaps , how it performed during this mission and how the data were reduced .",
    "their article is especially useful for pointing out special problems with the data that were mostly overcome in the reduction .",
    "it also shows an image of a portion of the echelle spectrum of @xmath0  ori  a.    the total exposure time on @xmath0  ori was 2412  s , divided among 63 frames , each of which covered  of the echelle s free spectral range .",
    "spectra were extracted using an optimal extraction routine described by jenkins , et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and different measurements of the intensity at any given wavelength were combined with weights proportional to their respective inverse squares of the errors .",
    "samples of some very restricted parts of the final spectrum are shown in fig .",
    "[ two_spec ] , where lines from @xmath10 = 0 , 1 , 3 and 5 may be seen .",
    "since imaps is an objective - grating instrument , there is no way that we can use an internal line emission light source to provide a calibration of the wavelength scale .",
    "however , as explained in jenkins , et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we have an accurate knowledge of how the apparent detector coordinates map into real geometrical coordinates on the image plane , and we also know the focal length of the cross - disperser grating and the angles of incidence and diffraction for the echelle grating . the only unknown parameter that we must measure",
    "is a zero offset that is driven by the pointing of imaps relative to the target .",
    "we determined this offset by measuring the positions of telluric absorption features of o  i in excited fine - structure levels .",
    "these features are rarely seen in the interstellar medium , but there is enough atmospheric oxygen above the orbital altitude of 295  km to produce the absorption features in all of our spectra .    to obtain a wavelength scale that would give heliocentric velocities  ori  a , one should subtract 17.5  km  s@xmath3 from the heliocentric velocity .",
    "differential galactic rotation at an assumed distance of 450  pc to @xmath0  ori  a should cause undisturbed gases in the general vicinity of the star to move at 4.5  km  s@xmath3 with respect to the lsr if the galaxy has a constant rotation velocity of 220  km  s@xmath3 and @xmath13 kpc ( gunn , knapp , & tremaine 1979 ) .",
    "thus , any feature appearing at a heliocentric velocity of 22.0  km  s@xmath3 should be approximately in the rest frame of gaseous material in the vicinity of our target .",
    "] for all of our lines , we adjusted the zero offset so that the telluric features appeared at + 27.0  km  s@xmath3 , a value that was appropriate for the viewing direction and time of our observations .",
    "the general accuracy of our wavelength scale is indicated by the fact that oxygen lines in 4 different multiplets all gave velocities within 0.5  km  s@xmath3 of the average .",
    "also , for h@xmath8 lines out of a given @xmath10 level that had roughly comparable transition strengths , the dispersion of measured velocities was about 0.5  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the measured position of the strongest component ( for all @xmath10 levels ) of 24.5  km  s@xmath3 compares favorably with the heliocentric velocity of a strong , but complex absorption feature of na  i centered on 24  km  s@xmath3 ( welty , hobbs , & kulkarni 1994 ) .",
    "the excited o  i lines can also be used to give an indication of the wavelength resolution of our observations .",
    "we measured equivalent widths of 10.5 and 7.25m  for the o  i@xmath14 and o  i@xmath15 lines at 1040.9 and 1041.7 , respectively .",
    "for the applicable densities and temperatures of the earth s upper atmosphere , the occupation of the singly excited level ( o  i@xmath14 ) should be 3 times that of the doubly excited level ( o  i@xmath15 ) , i.e. , their relative numbers are governed by just their statistical weights @xmath16 .",
    "making use of this fact allows us to apply a standard curve of growth analysis to derive log  n(o",
    "i@xmath15 )  =  14.19 and @xmath17 ( equivalent to a doppler broadening for @xmath18k ) .",
    "the observed profiles have widths that correspond to @xmath19 , which leads to the conclusion that the instrumental spread function is equivalent to a profile with @xmath20 ( the representative @xmath21 for the excited o  i lines has been elevated to 1.25  km  s@xmath3 to account for the small broadening caused by saturation ) .    the wavelength resolving power that we obtained is lower than what is achievable in principle with imaps and the pointing stability of the spacecraft .",
    "we attribute the degradation to small motions of the echelle grating during the exposures , caused by a sticky bearing that relieved mechanical stresses at random times .",
    "the magnitude and character of this effect is discussed in detail by jenkins , et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "we used the mslap analysis program to define the continuum level @xmath22 and re - express the intensities @xmath23 in terms of the apparent absorption optical depths @xmath24 as a function of radial velocity , @xmath25 for the ideal case where the instrument can resolve the finest details in velocity , @xmath26 usually gives an accurate depiction of a differential column density per unit velocity through the relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the transition s @xmath28-value and @xmath29 is expressed in  .",
    "however , if there are saturated , fine - scale details that are not resolved , the true optical depths @xmath30 averaged over velocity will be underestimated , and one will miscalculate the true column density @xmath31 . one can ascertain that this is happening if the application of eq .",
    "[ n_a ] for weaker lines indicates the presence of more material than from the strong ones ( savage & sembach 1991 ; jenkins 1996 ) . as will be evident in  [ unres_sat ]",
    ", this appears to happen for the strongest features of h@xmath8 in the @xmath10 = 0 , 1 and 2 levels of rotational excitation .    for @xmath10 levels 0 through 3 , we were able to draw together the results for many different absorption lines , each going to different rotational and vibrational levels in the upper electronic states , 2p@xmath32 and 2p@xmath33 .",
    "in so doing , it was important to keep track of the errors in the measured @xmath23 and combine redundant information at each velocity in a manner that lowered the error in the final result . to achieve this goal , we evaluated for every individual velocity point the @xmath34 from a summation over the separate transitions , @xmath35    the expected errors in intensity @xmath36 represented a combination of several sources of error : ( 1 ) the noise in the individual measurements of @xmath37 , ( 2 ) an error in the placement of the continuum @xmath22 , and ( 3 ) an error in the adopted value of zero spectral intensity ( which is a finite value of real intensity extracted from the echelle order ) .",
    "the errors in @xmath37 ( item 1 ) were measured from the dispersion of residual intensities on either side of the adopted continuum at points well removed in velocity from the absorption feature .",
    "this error generally becomes larger at progressively shorter wavelengths , because the sensitivity of imaps decreases .",
    "( variations of sensitivity also result from being away from the center of the echelle blaze function . ) in every case , the noise errors were assumed to be the same magnitude at low @xmath38 at the centers of lines because statistical fluctuations in the background illumination are important .",
    "( generally , the background was about as large as @xmath22 , so the noise amplitude would decrease only by a factor of @xmath39 . ) in a number of cases , the computed s / n was higher than 50 ( see tables  [ j0table]@xmath1[j3table ] ) .",
    "because there might be some residual systematic errors that we have not recognized , we felt that it was unwarranted to assume that these cases had the full reliability as indicated by the calculation of s / n , when compared with other measurements at lower s / n . to account for this",
    ", we uniformly adopted an estimate for the relative noise level consistent with the value @xmath40    the error in @xmath22 ( item 2 in the above paragraph ) represents the uncertainty of the continuum level that arises from a pure vertical translation that would be permitted by the noise in the many intensity measurements that define @xmath22 .",
    "it does _ not _ include errors in the adopted curvature of the continuum [ see a discussion of this issue in the appendix of sembach & savage ( 1992 ) ] .",
    "for most cases , the curvature was almost nonexistent .",
    "the error in the adopted background level ( item 3 ) was judged from the dispersion of residual intensities of saturated atomic lines elsewhere in the spectrum . at every velocity point ,",
    "the worst combinations of the systematic errors ( i.e. , both the adopted continuum and background levels are simultaneously too high or , alternatively , too low ) were combined in quadrature with the random intensity errors ( item 1 ) , as modified in eq .  [ noise ] , to arrive at the net @xmath36 .",
    "tables  [ j0table]@xmath1[j3table ] show the transitions for the four lowest rotational levels of h@xmath8 covered in our spectrum of @xmath0  ori .",

    "the listed values of s / n are those computed as described above , but without the modification from eq .  [ noise ] .",
    "all of the lines for @xmath10 = 4 were too weak to measure .",

    "et al . ( 1974 ) , the only target that showed lines from @xmath10=0 that were not on or very close to the flat portion of the curve of growth ( or had an uncertain measurement of the lyman 0@xmath10r(0 ) line ) was 30 cma .",

    "for instance , in their survey of 28 lines of sight , spitzer , et al .",
    "( 1974 ) found that for components that had @xmath85 , a single excitation temperature gave a satisfactory fit to all of the observable @xmath10 levels .",
    "by contrast , one generally finds for much higher column densities that there is bifurcation to two temperatures , depending on the @xmath10 levels [ see , e.g. , fig .  2 of spitzer & cochran ( 1973 ) ] .",
    "this is a consequence of the local density being high enough to insure that collisions dominate over radiative processes at low to intermediate @xmath10 and thus couple the level populations to the local kinetic temperature , whereas for higher @xmath10 the optical pumping can take over and yield a somewhat higher temperature . for cases where the total column densities are exceptionally low [ @xmath86 for such stars as @xmath0  pup , @xmath87  vel and @xmath88  sco ]",
    ", the rotation temperatures can be as high as about 1000k .",
    "this behavior is consistent with what we found for our components  1 and 2 .",
    "our component  3 has a somewhat lower excitation temperature , but one that is in accord with other lines of sight that have @xmath89 in the sample of spitzer , et al .",
    "( 1974 ) .",
    "it is when we go beyond the information conveyed by just the column densities and study changes in the profiles for different @xmath10 that we uncover some unusual behavior . here",
    ", we focus on component  1 , where the widths and velocity centroids show clear , progressive changes with rotational excitation . while component  3 also shows some broadening with increasing @xmath10 , the magnitude of the effect is less , and it is harder to quantify because there are probably unresolved , saturated structures that distort the @xmath51 profiles .",
    "the changes in broadening with @xmath10 are inconsistent with a simple picture that , for the most diffuse clouds , the excitation of molecular hydrogen is caused by optical pumping out of primarily the @xmath2 and 1 levels by uv starlight photons in an optically thin medium .",
    "we might momentarily consider an explanation where the strength of the optical pumping could change with velocity , by virtue of some shielding in the cores of some of the strongest pumping lines .",
    "however , in the simplest case we can envision , one where the light from @xmath0  ori dominates in the pumping , the shielding is not strong enough to make this effect work .",
    "for example , in component  1 we found @xmath90 ( table  [ comp_summary ] ) and a largest possible _ real value _ of table  [ chi2 ] ] of @xmath91 for molecules in the @xmath2 level .",
    "we would need to have a pumping line from @xmath2 with a characteristic strength @xmath92 to create an absorption profile @xmath93 that is saturated enough to have it appear , after a convolution with our instrumental profile , as broad as the observed @xmath51 for molecules in the @xmath54 state .",
    "profile as narrow as that for @xmath2 , such as pumping from many other , much weaker lines or the coupling of molecules in the @xmath54 state with the kinetic motions of the gas through elastic collisions . ] in reality , the strongest lines out of @xmath2 have @xmath65 only slightly greater than 1.8 ( see table  [ j0table ] ) . likewise",
    ", the width of the @xmath51 profile for @xmath72 can only be matched with a pumping line out of @xmath53 with @xmath94 , again a value that is much higher than any of the actual lines out of this level ( see table  [ j1table ] ) .",
    "thus , if we are to hold on to the notion that line shielding could be an important mechanism , we must abandon the idea that @xmath0  ori is the source of pumping photons .",
    "we could , of course , adopt a more imaginative approach and propose that light from another star is responsible for the pumping . then , we could envision that a significant concentration of h@xmath8 just off our line of sight could be shielding ( at selective velocities ) the radiation for the molecules that we can observe .",
    "while this could conceivably explain why the profiles for @xmath95 look different from those of @xmath2 or 1 , it does not address the problem that the profile for @xmath53 disagrees with that of @xmath2 .",
    "( the coupling of these two levels by optical pumping is very weak . ) as indicated by the numbers in table  [ chi2 ] , both the velocity widths and their centroids for these lowest two levels differ by more than the measurement errors .",
    "another means for achieving a significant amount of rotational excitation is heating due to the passage of a shock  one that is slow enough not to destroy the h@xmath8 ( aannestad & field 1973 ) .",
    "superficially , we might have imagined that component  1 is a shocked portion of the gas that was originally in component  3 , but that is now moving more toward us , relatively speaking .",
    "however this picture is in conflict with the change in velocity centroids with @xmath10 , for the gas would be expected to speed up as it cools in the postshock zone where radiative cooling occurs .",
    "our observations indicate that the cooler ( rear ) part of this zone that should emphasize the lower @xmath10 levels is actually traveling more slowly .    from the above argument on the velocity shift , it is clear that if we are to invoke a shock as the explanation for the profile changes , we must consider one that is headed in a direction away from us .",
    "if this is so , we run into the problem that we are unable to see any h@xmath8 ahead of this shock , i.e , at velocities more negative than component  1 .",
    "thus , instead of creating a picture where existing molecules are accelerated and heated by a shock , we must turn to the idea that perhaps the molecules are formed for the first time in the dense , compressed postshock zone , out of what was originally atomic gas undergoing cooling and recombination . in this case",
    ", one would look for a shock velocity that is relatively large , so that the compression is sufficient to raise the density to a level where molecules can be formed at a fast rate .",
    "there is some independent evidence from atomic absorption lines that we could be viewing a bow shock created by the obstruction of a flow of high velocity gas coming toward us , perhaps a stellar wind or a wind - driven shell ( weaver et al .",
    "a reasonable candidate for this obstruction is a cloud that is responsible for the low - ionization atomic features that can be seen near @xmath96 .    in the imaps spectrum of @xmath0  ori  a , there are some strong transitions of c  ii ( 1036.337 ) and n  ii ( 1083.990 ) that show absorption peaks at @xmath194  km  s@xmath3 , plus a smaller amount of material at slightly lower velocities ( jenkins 1995 )",

    "( 1996 ) , may result from either photoionization by uv radiation from the orion stars or collisional ionization at a temperature somewhat greater than @xmath97k .",
    "figure  [ civ ] shows spectra that we recovered from the hst archive in the vicinity of the c  iv doublet ( 1548.2 , 1550.8 ) .",
    "we determined an upper limit @xmath98 at @xmath99 .",
    "when this result is compared with the determination @xmath100 ( cowie , songaila , & york 1979 ) or 13.82 ( imaps spectrum ) , we find that @xmath101k if we use the collisional ionization curves of benjamin & shapiro ( 1996 ) for a gas that is cooling isobarically .",
    "( a similar argument arises from an upper limit for n  v / n  ii , but the resulting constraint on the temperature is weaker .",
    ") there is considerably more si  iii than si  ii in the high velocity gas ( cowie , songaila , & york 1979 ) , but this is may be due to photoionization .",
    "thus , to derive a lower limit for the temperature of the gas , we must use a typical equilibrium temperature for an h  ii region , somewhere in the range @xmath102k ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "figure  [ civ ] shows that there is a broad absorption from c  iv centered at a velocity of about @xmath103 , in addition to a narrower peak at about + 20  km  s@xmath3 .",

    "( while this assumption is not backed up by independent evidence , it is nevertheless a basic premise behind our relating the atomic absorption line data to our interpretation in  [ warm_formation ] and  [ cool_formation ] of how the h@xmath8 in component  1 is formed in a region where there is a large compression and a temperature that is considerably lower than that of the immediate postshock gas . )",

    ", the ordinary sound speed would be 21  km  s@xmath3 , and under these conditions the compression ratio would be only 2.67 [ cf .",
    "eq .  2.19 of draine & mckee ( 1993 ) ] if the magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the shock normal .",
    "this value is close to the ratio of velocities of the preshock and postshock components , @xmath113",
    ". the immediate postshock temperature would be about @xmath114k .",
    "our simple picture of a shock that is moderated by a transverse magnetic field adequately explains the velocity difference between the two atomic components , but it fails when we try to fit the kinematics of the much cooler gas where we find h@xmath8 .",
    "if we follow the material in the postshock flow to the point that radiative cooling has lowered the temperature to that of the preshock gas or below , we expect to have a final compression ratio equal to 3.7 , i.e. , the number that we would expect for an `` isothermal shock '' [ cf .",
    "eq .  2.27 of draine & mckee ( 1993 ) ]",
    ". this limited amount of compression would mean that the cool , h@xmath8-bearing gas would appear at a velocity of @xmath115 = @xmath116 , a value that is clearly inconsistent with what we observe .",
    "a resolution of the inconsistency between the kinematics noted above and the theoretical picture of a shock dominated by magnetic pressure could be obtained if , instead of having the initial magnetic field lines perpendicular to the shock normal , the field orientation is nearly parallel to the direction of the flow .",
    "( intuitively , this arrangement seems more plausible , since the field lines are likely to be dragged along by the gas . )",
    "the picture than can then evolve to the more complex situation where there is a `` switch - on '' shock , giving an initial moderate compression and a sudden deflection of the velocity flow and direction of the field lines . as described by spitzer ( 1990a , b ) ,",
    "this phase may then be followed by a downstream `` switch - off '' shock that redirects the flow and field lines to be perpendicular to the front and allows further compression of the gas up to values equal to the square of the shock s ordinary mach number , i.e. , the compression produced by a strong shock without a magnetic field .    in order to obtain a solution for a switch - on shock",
    ", one must satisfy the constraint that the alfvn speed must be greater than slightly more than half of the shock speed [ cf .",
    "eq . 2.21 of draine & mckee ( 1993 ) ] .",
    "thus , we must at least double the alfvn speed of the previous example by either raising the preshock magnetic field , lowering the density , or both . if this speed equalled @xmath117 , the compression ratio in the switch - on region should be @xmath118 , i.e. , the square of the alfvn mach number , a value that is again very close to our observed ratio of gas velocities on either side of the front .",
    "[ there is a complication in deriving a compression ratio from an observation taken at some arbitrary viewing direction through a switch - on shock . behind the front",
    ", the gas acquires a velocity vector component that is parallel to the front . for an inclined line of sight",
    ", this component can either add to or subtract from the projection of the component perpendicular to the front , which is the quantity that must be compared to the ( again projected ) preshock velocity vector when one wants to obtain a compression ratio .",
    "however in our situation it seems reasonable to suppose that a wind from @xmath0  ori is the ultimate source of high velocity gas , and this in turn implies that the shock front is likely to be nearly perpendicular to the line of sight . ]",
    "while this picture is still rather speculative , we will adopt the view that , through the mechanism of the switch - off shock , the magnetic fields do not play a significant role in limiting the amount of compression at the low temperatures where h@xmath8 could form .",
    "one additional piece of information is a limit on the preshock density @xmath119 .",
    "cowie , et al .",
    "( 1979 ) obtained an upper limit for the electron density @xmath120 from the lack of a detectable absorption feature from c  ii in an excited fine - structure level ( assuming @xmath121k ) .",
    "since there is virtually no absorption seen for lines of n  i or o  i at the high velocities in front of the shock , we can be confident that the hydrogen is almost fully ionized and thus the limit for @xmath122 applies to the total density .",
    "for the purposes of argument in the discussions that follow , we shall adopt a value @xmath111 , as we have done earlier .        in the light of evidence from the atomic lines that a standing shock may be present , we move on to explore in a semiquantitative way the prospects that h@xmath8 forming behind this front",
    "could explain our observations . for several reasons",
    ", we expect that an initial zone where @xmath123k will produce no appreciable h@xmath8 . at these temperatures",
    "the gas is mostly ionized , and for @xmath124k collisions with electrons will dissociate h@xmath8 very rapidly ( draine & bertoldi , in preparation ) . furthermore",
    ", the column density of material at @xmath125k is not large because the cooling rate is high .",
    "as soon as the gas has reached 6500k , there is a significant , abrupt reduction in the cooling rate while there is still some heating of the gas by ionizing radiation produced by the much hotter , upstream material .",
    "these effects create a plateau in the general decrease of temperature with postshock distance [ see fig .  3 of shull & mckee ( 1979 ) ] .",
    "the 6500k plateau , extending over a length of approximately @xmath126 , seems to be a favorable location for synthesizing the initial contribution of h@xmath8 that we could be viewing in the upper @xmath10 levels .",
    "its velocity with respect to much cooler gas should be about @xmath127 if the conditions are approximately isobaric .",
    "this velocity difference is consistent , to within the observational errors , with the shift between the peaks at @xmath68 and @xmath2 , with the latter emphasizing molecules in the material that has cooled much further and come nearly to a halt .",
    "considering that the fractional ionization over the temperature range @xmath128k is @xmath129 ( shull & mckee 1979 ) , we anticipate that potentially important sources of h@xmath8 arise from either the formation of a negative hydrogen ion , @xmath130 ( @xmath131 is the gas s temperature in units of @xmath132k ) followed by the associative detachment , @xmath133 or the production of h@xmath134 by radiative association , @xmath135 followed by its reaction with neutral atoms , @xmath136 ( black 1978 ; black , porter , & dalgarno 1981 ) .",
    "the rate constants for the above reactions ( plus the destruction reactions [ c10 ] and [ c5 ] below ) are the same as those adopted by culhane & mccray ( 1995 ) in their study of h@xmath8 production in a supernova envelope .",
    "later , as the gas becomes cooler , denser and mostly neutral , we expect that the formation of h@xmath8 on the surfaces of dust grains , @xmath137 should start to become more important ( hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) .",
    "we will address this possibility in ",
    "[ cool_formation ] .    in order to evaluate the effectiveness of reactions [ c9 ] and [ c3 ] in producing h@xmath8 in the warm gas , we must consider the most important destruction processes that counteract the production of the feedstocks h@xmath11 ( reaction  [ c8 ] ) and h@xmath134 ( reaction  [ c2 ] ) .",
    "radiative dissociation of h@xmath11 by uv starlight photons ( i.e. , the reverse of reaction  [ c8 ] ) , @xmath138 is generally the most important mechanism for limiting the eventual production of h@xmath8 in partially ionized regions of the interstellar medium .",
    "the value for @xmath139 is adopted from an estimate for this rate of destruction in our part of the galaxy by fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1994 ) .",
    "less important ways of destroying h@xmath11 include recombination with protons , @xmath140 and , of course , the production of h@xmath8 ( reaction  [ c9 ] ) .",
    "h@xmath134 is destroyed by the reaction with electrons , @xmath141 and the creation of h@xmath8 in reaction  [ c3 ] .",
    "we can safely disregard the interaction of h@xmath134 with h@xmath8 , @xmath142 because @xmath143 .",
    "finally , our end product h@xmath8 is destroyed by photodissociation , @xmath144 our adopted general value for @xmath145 makes use of jura s ( 1974 ) calculation of @xmath146 for a flux of @xmath147 at 1000 , but rescaled to a local flux of @xmath148 calculated by mezger , et al .",
    "a large fraction of this background may come from sources that are behind or within cloud complexes containing h@xmath8 .",
    "if this is true , the stellar radiation in the cores of the most important werner and lyman lines is converted to radiation at other wavelengths via fluorescence ( black & van dishoeck 1987 ) , leading to a lower value for @xmath145 .",
    "the reduction in @xmath145 caused by self shielding of material within component  1 is small : for @xmath149 and @xmath150 it is only 32% ( draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .",
    "we will discuss in ",
    "[ reconciliation ] how much the photodissociation of h@xmath8 could be increased by the gas s proximity to the hot , bright stars in the orion association .",

    "are about equal at @xmath174k , but the photodestruction becomes much more important at lower temperatures .",
    "the integral of the predicted @xmath175 ( eq .  [ h2_equilibrium ] ) over a path that extends down to @xmath171k equals @xmath176 .",
    "this value is substantially lower than the amount of h@xmath8 that we observed in the higher @xmath10 levels in component  1 [ @xmath177 ; see table  [ comp_summary ] ] .",
    "there are several effects that can cause significant deviations from the simple prediction for @xmath56 given above .",
    "first , if we accept the principle that the origin of the preshock flow at @xmath178 is from either a stellar wind produced by @xmath0  ori ( plus perhaps other stars in the association ) or some explosive event in orion , we must then acknowledge that the h@xmath8 production zone is probably not very distant from this group of stars that produce a very strong uv flux . as a consequence",
    ", we must anticipate that @xmath145 could be increased far above that for the general interstellar medium given in eq .",
    "[ h2_equilibrium ] shows that this will give a reduction in the expected yield of h@xmath8 in direct proportion to this increase .",
    "( for a given enhancement of @xmath145 , we expect that the increase in @xmath139 will be very much less because the cross section for this process is primarily in the visible part of the spectrum where the contrast above the general background is relatively small . )",
    "working in the opposite direction , however , is the fact that the stars lyman limit fluxes will supplement the ionizing radiation produced by the hot part of the shock front , thus providing heating and photoionization rates above those given in the model . the resulting higher level of @xmath28 and the increase of the length of the warm gas zone will result in an increase in the expected @xmath56 .    to see how important these effects might be , we can make some crude estimates for the relevant increases in the uv fluxes . in the vicinity of 1000 i.e. , the spectral region containing the most important transitions that ultimately result in photodissociation of h@xmath8 , the fluxes from @xmath179 and @xmath180  ori at the earth are @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively ( holberg et al . 1982 ) .",
    "we can assume that other very luminous stars that might make important contributions , such as @xmath183 , @xmath0 , @xmath184 and @xmath185  ori , have uv fluxes consistent with that of @xmath179  ori after a scaling according to the differences in visual magnitudes .",
    "the probable distance of the h@xmath8 from the stars is probably somewhere in the range 60 to 140 pc , as indicated by various measures of the transverse dimensions of shell - like structures seen around the orion association ( goudis 1982 ) ( and assuming that the orion association is at a distance of 450 pc from us ) .",
    "if we compare the far - uv extinction differences for @xmath183 and @xmath179  ori reported by jenkins , savage & spitzer ( 1986 ) to these stars color excesses e(b@xmath1v ) = 0.075 , we infer from the uv extinction formulae of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) that @xmath186=4.6 and , again using their formulae , that @xmath187 in the absence of such extinction , these plus the other stars should produce a net flux @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the distance away from the stars divided by 100 pc . with @xmath190 , @xmath145 is enhanced over the value in eq .",
    "[ c17 ] by a factor of 7 .",
    "stars in the orion association produce about @xmath191 lyman limit photons @xmath192 , and only a small fraction of this flux is consumed by the ionization of hydrogen in the immediate vicinity of the stars ( reynolds & ogden 1979 ) . from this estimate",
    ", one may conclude that the ionizing flux of @xmath193 radiated by the immediate postshock gas ( shull & mckee 1979 ) could be enhanced by a factor approaching @xmath194 , thus increasing the thickness of the region over which there is a significant degree of ionization and heating .",
    "another parameter that can influence the length of the zone where reactions [ c9 ] and [ c3 ] are important is the relative abundances of heavy elements . here",
    ", the cooling is almost entirely from the radiation of energy by forbidden , semi - forbidden and fine - structure lines from metals  see fig .  2 of shull & mckee ( 1979 ) .",
    "if these elements are depleted below the solar abundance ratio because of grain formation , the length of the warm h@xmath8 production zone must increase ( shull & draine 1987 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the grains will been completely destroyed as they passed through a @xmath195 shock ( jones et al .",
    "1994 ) .    finally , it is important to realize that the outcome for @xmath56 should scale roughly in proportion to @xmath196 .",
    "the reason for this is that over most of the path , we found that @xmath197 was the most important term within denominator of the dominant production factor @xmath169 .",
    "this in turn makes @xmath175 scale in proportion to @xmath198 almost everywhere ( note that @xmath199 does not vary with @xmath119 ) .",
    "it is important to look for other absorption line data that can help to narrow the uncertainties in the key parameters discussed above .",
    "one such indicator is the column density of ionized silicon in an excited fine - structure level of its ground electronic state ( denoted as si  ii@xmath14 ) .",
    "this excited level is populated by collisions with electrons , and the balance of this excitation with the level s radiative decay ( and collisional de - excitations ) results in a fractional abundance @xmath200 ( keenan et al .",
    "1985 ) . in conditions where the hydrogen is only partially ionized",
    ", we expect that @xmath201 will be much less than @xmath202 because ionized si has a larger recombination coefficient ( aldrovandi & pquignot 1973 ) and a smaller photoionization cross section ( reilman & manson 1979 ) ( its ionization potential of 16.34  ev is also greater than that of hydrogen ) .",
    "thus , for situations where @xmath28 is not very near 1.0 , it is reasonably safe to assume that virtually all of the si is singly ionized . if , for the moment , we also assume that the si to h abundance ratio is equal to the solar value , we expect that @xmath203 as we did for h@xmath8 , we can integrate the expression for @xmath204 through the modeled cooling zone to find an expectation for the column density @xmath205 .",
    "a very weak absorption feature caused by si  ii@xmath14 at approximately the same velocity as our component  1 can be seen in a medium resolution hst spectrum of @xmath0  ori  a that covers the very strong transition at 1264.730 .",
    "our measurement of this line s equivalent width was @xmath206m , leading to @xmath207 , a result reported by drake & pottasch ( 1977 ) , one obtains a somewhat lower value , @xmath208 that is almost twice the prediction stated above .    from our result for si  ii@xmath14 , we conclude that the combined effect of the stars ionizing flux and a possible increase in @xmath119 over our assumed value of @xmath209 could raise @xmath210 by not much more than a factor of two . however , we have no sensitivity to the possibility that metals are depleted since the decrease in the abundance of si would be approximately compensated by the increase in the characteristic length for the zone to cool ( assuming the primary coolants and si are depleted by about the same amount ) .",
    "thus , it is still possible that the our calculation based on a model with solar abundances will result in an inappropriate ( i.e. , too low ) value for the expected @xmath56 .",
    "one remaining task is to establish that the conditions in the h@xmath8-formation zone are such that collisional excitation of the higher @xmath10 levels can overcome the tendency for the molecules to move to other states through either radiative decay or the absorption of uv photons .",
    "tawara et al .",
    "( 1990 ) summarize the collision cross sections as a function of energy for excitations @xmath211 and @xmath212 by electrons .",
    "we calculate that these cross sections should give a rate constant of about @xmath213 for @xmath214 .",
    "thus , for @xmath215 and @xmath216 the collisions can dominate over radiative transition rates of about @xmath217 for @xmath54 and 3 . to collisionally populate @xmath68 which can decay at a rate of @xmath218 to @xmath72",
    ", we would need to have @xmath219 just to match the radiative rate , assuming that the collisional rate constant is not significantly lower than what we calculated for @xmath54 and 3 .",
    "additional formation of h@xmath8 molecules probably takes place in gas that has cooled well below 2000k and is nearly fully recombined .",
    "we are unable to distinguish between this gas and the material that was originally present as an obstruction to the high velocity flow to create the bow shock . to obtain an approximate measure of the total amount of cool , mostly neutral gas",
    ", we determined @xmath220 over the velocity interval @xmath221 for the n  i line at 1134.165  which does not appear to be very strongly saturated .",
    "the relative ionization of nitrogen should be close to that of hydrogen ( butler & dalgarno 1979 ) , and this element is not strongly depleted in the interstellar medium ( hibbert , dufton , & keenan 1985 ) .",

    "@xmath224 is the amount of material that accumulates by the time @xmath163 reaches 1000k .",
    "hence , from our measure of the total n(h ) ( but indeed an approximate one ) , we estimate that the amount of gas at @xmath225k is about comparable to that at the higher temperatures .",
    "an insight on the conditions in the cool , neutral zone is provided by the populations of excited fine - structure levels of c  i. jenkins & shaya ( 1979 ) found that @xmath226 in the part of our component  1 that carries most of the neutral carbon atoms .",

    ", we expect an equilibrium concentration @xmath230 .",
    "when we multiply this number by our estimate @xmath231 , we find that we should expect to observe @xmath232 , a value that , after considering the crudeness of our calculations , is acceptably close to our actual measurements of h@xmath8 in @xmath2 and 1 , the levels that arise primarily from the coolest gas .",
    "if @xmath145 is significantly enhanced by radiation from the orion stars (  [ reconciliation ] ) , we would then have difficulty explaining the observations .",
    "we have observed over 50 absorption features in the lyman and werner bands of h@xmath8 in the uv spectrum of @xmath0  ori  a. an important aspect of our spectrum is that it had sufficient resolution to detect in one of the velocity components ( our component  1 ) some important changes in the one - dimensional velocity distributions of the molecules with changing rotational excitation @xmath10 .",
    "the main focus of our investigation has been to find an explanation for this result , since it is a departure from the usual expectation that the rotational excitation comes from uv pumping , an effect that would make the profiles look identical . a smaller amount of broadening for higher @xmath10 is also seen for component  3 , a component that has much more h@xmath8 than component  1 .    in component  1 , we have found that as @xmath10 increases from 0 to 5 there is a steady increase in the width of the velocity profile , combined with a small drift of the profile s center toward more negative velocities .",
    "we have shown that the pumping lines are not strong enough to make differential shielding in the line cores a satisfactory explanation for the apparent broadening of the @xmath10 levels that are populated by such pumping .",
    "while one might resort to an explanation that unseen , additional h@xmath8 could be shielding light from a uv source ( or sources ) other than @xmath0  ori , we feel that this interpretation is implausible , and , moreover , it does not adequately explain the differences that we see between the profiles of @xmath2 and 1 .",
    "one could always argue that the absorption that we identify as component  1 is really a chance superposition of two , physically unrelated regions that have different rotation temperatures and central velocities .",
    "lines at a resolution that was so low that complexes 1 and 3 were not quite resolved from each other .",
    "we would then see features that got broader with increasing @xmath10 , and their centers would shift toward the left .",
    "this is qualitatively exactly the same effect that we see on a much smaller velocity scale within component  1 . ] while not impossible , this interpretation is unattractive .",
    "it requires a nearly exact coincidence of the two regions velocity centers to make up a component that stands out from the rest of the h@xmath8 absorption and , at the same time , shows smoothly changing properties with @xmath10 at our velocity resolution .",
    "we feel that the most acceptable interpretation is the existence of a coherent region of gas that , for some particular reason that has a rational explanation , has systematic changes in the properties of the material within it that could produce the effects that we observe .",
    "one phenomenon that fits this picture is the organized change in temperature and velocity for gas that is cooling and recombining in the flow behind a shock front .",
    "the excess width of the higher @xmath10 lines could arise from both higher kinetic temperatures and some velocity shear caused by the steady compression of the gas as it cools .",
    "our concept of a shock is supported by evidence from atomic absorption lines in the spectrum of @xmath0  ori  a. we see features that we can identify with both the preshock medium and the immediate postshock gas that is very hot .",
    "if this interpretation is correct ( and not a misguided attempt to assign a significant relationship between atomic components with different levels of ionization at very different velocities ) , we can use the atomic features to learn much more about the shock s general properties .",
    "we start with the expectation that the coolest molecular material , that which shows up in the lowest @xmath10 levels at @xmath233 , is in a region containing gas that is very strongly compressed and thus nearly at rest with respect to the shock front . the atomic features of c  ii and n  ii that we identify with the preshock flow appear at a velocity of @xmath234 with respect to the cool h@xmath8 .",
    "hence this is the value that we normally associate with the `` shock velocity . ''",
    "this preshock gas also shows up in the lines of c  iii , n  iii , si  iii , s  iii and al  iii . an upper limit to its temperature @xmath101k results from the apparent lack of c  iv that would arise from collisional ionization at slightly higher temperatures",
    ". the temperature could be as low as typical h  ii region temperatures ( @xmath235k ) if uv photons are the main source of ionization .",
    "absorption features from more highly ionized gas at around @xmath236 that show up in the c  iv doublet indicate that the initial compression factor is only 2.6 , a value that is significantly lower than the usual 4.0 expected for a shock with a high mach number .",
    "reasonable numbers for the preshock density , temperature and magnetic field strength ( @xmath209 , 20,000k and @xmath237 g ) can explain this lower compression factor and establish a switch - on shock .",
    "however , except for a limit @xmath238 that comes from the lack of c  ii@xmath14 absorption , we have no independent information that can distinguish between these somewhat arbitrary assignments and other , equally acceptable combinations .    to overcome the problem that there seems to be a low initial compression of the gas but eventually the densities are allowed to increase to the point that h@xmath8 can form , we invoke the concept of an oblique magnetic shock , where the theoretical models outline the existence of two discontinuities , a `` switch on '' front and a `` switch off '' front .",
    "however , we do not attempt to explore the validity of this picture in any detail .    neglecting complications that are introduced by the oblique shock picture",
    ", we expect that as the gas flow cools to temperatures significantly below the immediate postshock temperature , it decelerates and begins to show ions that have ionization potentials below that of c  iv , such as si  iii ( at @xmath239 ) and al  iii ( @xmath240 ) . at temperatures somewhat below @xmath97k , the gas should be still partially ionized and at a density @xmath241 .",
    "these conditions favor the production of h@xmath8 via the formation of h@xmath11 and its subsequent reaction with h to produce the molecule plus an electron , rather than the usual formation on grains that dominates in cool clouds .",
    "our observation of the si  ii@xmath14 absorption feature at a velocity near @xmath242 indicates that it is unlikely that @xmath243 , and thus the density in the molecule forming region is high enough to insure that the photodetachment of h@xmath11 does not deplete this feed material to the point that the expected abundance of h@xmath8 is well below the amount that we observe .",
    "it is possible that the uv flux from the orion stars could enhance the h@xmath8 photodissociation rate @xmath145 to a level that is far above that which applies to the average level in our part of the galaxy .",
    "if this is true , then we must make a downward revision to our prediction that @xmath244 . at the same time , however , additional ionizing photons from the stars could lengthen the warm h@xmath8 production zone , and this effect may gain back a large amount of the lost h@xmath8 .",
    "a reduction in the metal abundance in the gas may also lengthen the zone , giving a further increase in the expected h@xmath8 .",
    "as the gas compresses further and becomes almost fully neutral , the h@xmath11 production must yield to grain surface reactions as the most important source of molecules . using information from the c  i fine - structure excitation , we can infer that the density in the cool gas is sufficient to give @xmath245 equal to about half of what we observed , if we assume that most of the h@xmath8 in the @xmath2 and 1 states comes from the cool region .",
    "on the basis of a diverse collection of evidence and some rough quantitative calculations , we have synthesized a general description of the cooling gas behind the shock and have shown that h@xmath8 production within it could plausibly explain the unusual behavior in the profiles that we observed . obviously ,",
    "if one had the benefit of detailed shock models that incorporated the relevant magnetohydrodynamic , atomic and molecular physics , it would be possible to substantiate this picture ( or perhaps uncover some inconsistencies ? ) and narrow the uncertainties in various key parameters .",
    "also , more detailed models should allow one to address certain questions that are more difficult to answer , such as whether or not more complex chemical reactions play an important role in modifying the production of h@xmath8 ; we have identified only a few good prospects .",
    "for instance , is there enough ly-@xmath246 radiation produced in the front ( or in the h  ii region ahead of it ) to make the formation by excited atom radiative association ( i.e. , h(@xmath247 ) + h(@xmath248 ) @xmath249 h@xmath8 + @xmath250 ) an important additional production route ( latter & black 1991 ) ? on the observational side , we expect to see very soon a vast improvement in the amount and quality of data on atomic absorption lines toward @xmath0  ori  a. very recently , the ghrs echelle spectrograph on hst obtained observations of various atomic lines at extraordinarily good resolution and s / n .",
    "support for flying imaps on the orfeus - spas - i mission and the research reported here came from nasa grant nag5 - 616 to princeton university .",
    "the orfeus - spas project was a joint undertaking of the us and german space agencies , nasa and dara .",
    "the successful execution of our observations was the product of efforts over many years by engineering teams at princeton university observatory , ball aerospace systems group ( the industrial subcontractor for the imaps instrument ) and daimler - benz aerospace ( the german firm that built the astro - spas spacecraft and conducted mission operations ) .",

    "<S> a spectrum of @xmath0  ori  a over the wavelength interval 950@xmath11150recorded by interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( imaps ) on the orfeus - spas  i mission shows lyman and werner band absorption features from molecular hydrogen in rotational levels @xmath2 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the molecules are found in two distinct velocity components . </S>",
    "<S> one is at a heliocentric radial velocity of about @xmath11  km  s@xmath3 with @xmath4 and a rotational temperature @xmath5k , while the other is at + 25  km  s@xmath3 with @xmath6 and @xmath7k . </S>",
    "<S> some extra h@xmath8 exists in a much weaker component ( @xmath9 ) between the two main peaks .    </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath8 component at @xmath11  km  s@xmath3 exhibits profile shapes that become broader and show small displacements toward more negative velocities as @xmath10 increases . </S>",
    "<S> these changes are inconsistent with a simple interpretation that uv optical pumping in an optically thin , uniform medium creates the h@xmath8 in excited rotational levels . </S>",
    "<S> differential shielding of the uv radiation at certain velocities does not appear to be a satisfactory explanation for the effect .    </S>",
    "<S> evidence from atomic features at other velocities may offer some insight on the origin of this unusual behavior exhibited by the h@xmath8 profiles . </S>",
    "<S> absorption features from moderately ionized atoms at @xmath194  km  s@xmath3 and more highly ionized species at about @xmath136  km  s@xmath3 suggest that along the line of sight to @xmath0  ori  a there may be a standing bow shock with an initial compression ratio of 2.6 . </S>",
    "<S> this shock is probably created when a negative - velocity gas flow collides with an obstruction , in this case a neutral cloud at 0  km  s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> if this interpretation is correct , the h@xmath8 with the changing profiles may represent molecules forming in the postshock gas flow that is undergoing further compression as it recombines and cools . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that molecules can form initially by associative detachment of h@xmath11 in a moving , warm , partly ionized medium behind the front . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath8 in this area is most conspicuous in the higher @xmath10 levels . </S>",
    "<S> later , when the gas becomes very cool , neutral , and more compressed as it comes nearly to a halt , it is more easily seen in the lowest @xmath10 levels . in this part of the medium , </S>",
    "<S> the principal way of producing h@xmath8 should be from reactions on the surfaces of dust grains , as one expects for quiescent interstellar clouds . </S>"
