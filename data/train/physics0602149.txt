    "in the last few years the physics community has paid a lot of attention to the field of complex networks .",
    "a considerable amount of research has been done on different real world networks , complex network theory and mathematical models @xcite .",
    "many real world systems can be described as complex networks : www @xcite , internet routers @xcite , proteins @xcite and scientific collaborations @xcite , among others .",
    "complex network theory benefitted from the study of such networks both from the motivational aspect as well as from the new problems that arise with every newly analyzed system .    in this paper we will present an analysis of wikipedias in different languages as complex networks .",
    "wikipedia @xcite is a web - based encyclopedia with an unusual editorial policy that anybody can freely edit and crosslink articles as long as one follows a simple set of rules .",
    "although there has been a lot of debate on the quality of wikipedia articles , recent findings reported in @xcite suggest that the factographic accuracy of the english wikipedia is not much worse than that of the editorially compiled encyclopedias such as _ encyclopaedia britannica_.    the important facts for this paper are : 1 . that authors are encouraged to link out of their articles , and 2 . that each wikipedia is a product of a cooperative community .",
    "the former comes in part from the need for lexicographic links providing context for the topic at hand , and in part from the fact that the official wikipedia article count , serving as the main criterion for comparing encyclopedia sizes , includes only articles that contain an out - link .",
    "a community arises initially from the need to follow the central wikipedia policy of the neutral point of view ( npov ) : if there is a dispute regarding the content of an article , effectively all the opposing views and arguments regarding the topic should be addressed .",
    "although there are many occasional contributors , the bulk of the work is done by a minority : roughly 10% of contributors edit 80% of the articles , and the differing degree of authors involvement serves as a rough criterion for a meritocracy .",
    "hence , there is no central structure that governs the writing of a wikipedia , but the process is not entirely haphazard .",
    "we view each wikipedia as a network with nodes corresponding to articles and directed links corresponding to hyperlinks between them .",
    "there are over 200 wikipedias in different languages , with different number of nodes and links , which are continuously growing by the addition of new nodes and creation of new links .",
    "the model of wikipedia growth based on the  preferential attachment \" @xcite has been recently tested against the empirical data @xcite .",
    "although different wikipedias are developed mostly independently , a number of people have contributed in two or more different languages , and thus participated in creating different wikipedia networks .",
    "a certain number of articles have been simply translated from one language wikipedia into another . also , larger wikipedias set precedents for smaller ones on issues of both structure and governance .",
    "there is thus a degree of interdependence between wikipedias in different languages .",
    "however , each language community has its unique characteristics and idiosyncrasies , and it can be assumed that the growth of each wikipedia is an autonomous process , governed by the  function affects structure \" maxim .",
    "namely , despite being produced by independent communities , all wikipedias ( both in their content and in their structure ) aim to reflect the  received knowledge \" @xcite , which in general should be universal and inter - linguistic .",
    "it is expected that community - specific deviations of structure occur in cases where the content is less universal than e.g. in natural science , but it is also expected that such deviations plague each wikipedia at some stage of its development .",
    "we thus assume we are looking at real network realizations of different stages of essentially the same process of growth , implemented by different communities . by showing which network characteristics are more general and which more particular to individual wikipedias and the process of wikipedia growth , we hope to provide insight into generality and/or particularity of the network growth processes .",
    "the main focus of our study is to compare networks of lexicographic articles between different languages .",
    "however , the wikipedia dataset is very rich , and it is not easily reducible to a simple network in which each wiki page is a node , as various kinds of wiki pages play different roles . in particular , the dataset contains :    * _ articles , _  normal \" wiki pages with lexicographic topics ; * _ categories , _ wiki pages that serve to categorize articles ; * _ images and multimedia _ as pages in their own right ; * _ user , help _ and _ talk _ pages ; * _ redirects , _ quasi - topics that simply redirect the user to another page ; * _ templates , _ standardized insets of wiki text that may add links and categories to a page they are included in ; and * _ broken links , _ links to articles that have no text and do not exist in the database , but may be created at some future time .",
    "we studied 30 largest language wikipedias with the data from january 7 , 2005 .",
    "especially we focused on eleven largest languages as measured by the number of undirected links . in order of size ,",
    "as measured by the number of nodes , these are : english ( en ) , german ( de ) , japanese ( ja ) , french ( fr ) , swedish ( sv ) , polish ( pl ) , dutch ( nl ) , spanish ( es ) , italian ( it ) , portuguese ( pt ) and chinese ( zh ) . based on different possible approaches to the study we analyzed six different datasets for each language with varying policies concerning the selection of data .",
    "we present our results for the smallest subset we studied for each language , designed to match the knowledge network of actual lexicographic topics most closely .",
    "it excludes categories , images , multimedia , user , help and talk pages , as well as broken links , and replaces redirects and templates with direct links between articles . for a detailed explanation of the dataset selection issues",
    ", please see our webpage @xcite .",
    "an interesting measurement of the wikipedia dataset statistical properties is given in @xcite , and a nice visualization of the wikipedia data can be found in @xcite .",
    ".[tab : tabela ] the table of @xmath0 power - law exponents for in , out and undirected degree distributions for the eleven largest languages .",
    "the exponents for all languages except polish follow the pattern @xmath1 .",
    "it is not a surprise that the polish language exhibits uncommon behavior having in mind its unusual degree distribution depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kumulativne ] .",
    "the average values and corresponding errors of the universal exponents are calculated in two ways .",
    "the upper one is calculated as a mean value and a standard deviation of different exponents in the sample .",
    "the lower is calculated with the assumption that all exponents are the same and differences are related to exponent estimation i.e. the error is calculated as the standard error of the mean .",
    "it is important to stress that exponents are not estimated from the degree @xmath2 , but from @xmath3 for which the estimated exponent is stable . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the path analysis of the wikipedia networks reveals interesting results , as shown in table [ tab : path ] for the eleven largest languages .",
    "the studied quantities are the average path length of the undirected paths in wcc @xmath4 ( calculated as an arithmetic mean ) and the average path length of the directed paths in wcc @xmath5 ( calculated as a harmonic mean ) . for both of these quantities ,",
    "the largest wikipedias show no evidence of scaling of the average path lengths with the network size .",
    "however , the values of @xmath4 for all examined networks are close to the expected average path length for a random network @xmath6 , so the wikipedia networks exhibit small - world behavior in the original sense .",
    "in addition , the shortest average path values for the eleven largest languages are very close to one another , with very small scattering around the average value of the sample ( see table [ tab : path ] ) .",
    "this scattering is considerably smaller than that of @xmath7 .",
    "the last quantity we present in this paper are the triad significance profiles ( tsp ) , introduced in @xcite , which describe the local structure of the networks .",
    "counts of specific triads ( directed three - node subgraphs , shown in fig . [ fig : motifs2 ] along the abscissa ) in the original network are compared to counts of triads in randomly generated networks with the same degree distribution .",
    "the significance profile @xmath8 is the normalized vector    @xmath9    of statistical significance scores @xmath10 for each triad @xmath11 ,    @xmath12    here @xmath13 is the count of appearances of the triad @xmath11 in the original network , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the average and the standard deviation of the counts of the triad @xmath11 over a sample of randomly generated networks .    in @xcite ,",
    "milo et al .",
    "identify superfamilies of networks for which triad significance profiles closely resemble each other . assuming that one can look at the wikipedia as a representation of the knowledge network created by many contributors",
    ", one could expect a possible new superfamily of networks .",
    "the triad significance superfamily from @xcite one would expect to be closest to the wikipedia is the one that includes www and social contacts .",
    "the triad significance profile of the largest seven wikipedias is depicted in the fig .",
    "[ fig : motifs2 ] , and shows common features found in all examined wikipedias .",
    "these tsps indeed belong to the same superfamily as the tsps of www and social contacts reported in @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : motifcorr ] . within this superfamily ,",
    "the www of nd.edu exhibits higher correlation with the wikipedias than the social networks do .",
    "since the tsp takes into account the reciprocity of directed links , one could naively expect that wikipedia reciprocity would also be very similar to the www s reciprocity , but we found this is not the case .",
    "the scaling of the triads which are the most represented in the wikipedia networks ( denoted as 10 and 13 ) with the network size is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : motifsscale ] . since both of these triads represent triangles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : motifs2 ] ) they contribute to increasing the clustering coefficient .",
    "the wikipedia tsp thus sheds additional light on the large clustering of wikipedia networks , fig .",
    "[ fig : clustering2 ] .",
    "( color online ) the triad significance profiles of wikipedias are very similar .",
    "the x - axis depicts all possible triads of a directed network , while the y - axis represents the normalized z score for a given triad , given by eq .",
    "( [ tspeq ] ) .. tsp shapes resemble the tsp of www reported in @xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    ( color online ) the correlations between tsps of the eleven largest languages , the www of the nd.edu domain @xcite and the social networks of positive sentiment between prisoners ( soc1 ) and leadership class students ( soc2 ) @xcite .",
    "wikipedias except for polish and italian shown in order of size .",
    "all wikipedia profiles and the www profile are pairwise very similar . with the exception of polish and italian , profiles of languages of similar sizes",
    "tend to be more closely correlated .",
    "also , smaller wikipedias resemble the social networks better than the larger ones do.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    ( color online ) the scaling of the normalized z score for the most represented triads with the size of the network .",
    "the plot demonstrates that the representation of the triad 13 ( circles ) grows , whereas the representation of the triad 10 ( squares ) falls with the growth of the network .",
    "this effectively means that wikipedia has a tendency of creating strong ( bidirectional ) links for the well connected cliques.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "we have examined the following characteristics of different language wikipedia article networks : degree distribution properties , growth , topology , reciprocity , clustering , assortativity , average shortest path lengths , and triad significance profiles . based on our results , it is very likely that the growth process of wikipedias is universal .",
    "the similarities between wikipedias in all the measured characteristics suggest that we have observed the same kind of a complex network in different stages of development .",
    "we have also found that certain individual wikipedias , such as polish or italian , significantly differ from the other members of the observed set .",
    "this difference can be seen most easily in their degree distributions , but also shows in assortativity , clustering and the triad significance profile . in the case of the polish wikipedia , where the discrepancies are the greatest , we have found that they were caused by an editorial decision involving calendar pages .",
    "this shows that the common growth process we have observed is very sensitive to community - driven decisions .",
    "we have shown further that wikipedia article networks on the whole resemble the www networks . specifically , they belong to the tsp superfamily described in @xcite that includes www and social networks , and exhibit small - world behavior , with average shortest path lengths close to those of a random network .",
    "in some characteristics , however , large wikipedias seem to diverge from the www . their reciprocity is lower than that of the www reported in @xcite , and",
    "their average shortest path lengths seem to tend to a stable value .",
    "it is possible that the specific properties of wikipedias are related to the underlying structure of knowledge , but also that their shared features stem from growth dynamics driven by free contributions , common policies and community decision making .",
    "whichever the case , the regularities we have found point to the existence of a unique growth process . these findings in turn",
    "support the method of using statistical ensembles in network research , and , finally , affirm the role of statistical physics in modeling complex social interaction systems such as wikipedia .",
