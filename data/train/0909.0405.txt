    "cosmic strings are topological defects which are formed as a result of phase transitions with spontaneous breakdown of symmetries in early universe , see , e.g. , reviews in @xcite . starting with a random tangle ,",
    "the cosmic string network evolves into two distinct sets : the stable one which consists of several long , approximately straight strings spanning the horizon volume and the unstable one which consists of a variety of string loops decaying by gravitational radiation .",
    "a straight infinitely long cosmic string in its rest frame is characterized by stres - energy tensor with only two nonvanishing components @xmath3 , where the 3-rd coordinate axis is chosen to be directed along the string .",
    "the appropriate global characteristics of the string is tension ( or linear density of mass ) @xmath4 where the integration is over the transverse section of the core of the string , and in what follows we use units @xmath5 and the metric conventions of @xcite . according to general relativity ,",
    "stress - energy tensor is a source of gravity , and , consequently , the space - time region corresponding to the string core possesses positive scalar curvature @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the gravitational constant ) , since energy density @xmath8 is positive inside this region . in the case of a cosmic string associated with spontaneous breakdown of a continuous symmetry , tension ( 1 )",
    "is related to mass @xmath9 of the higgs scalar field , @xmath10 , and , in addition , the string is also characterized by gauge field with strength @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the gauge field vector potential and @xmath13 ) which is directed along the string and is nonvanishing inside its core @xcite .",
    "the appropriate global characteristics is flux of this gauge field strength @xmath14 note that the transverse size of the string core is of order of @xmath15 .",
    "the space - time metric outside the string core is defined by squared length element @xmath16 where @xmath17 a surface which is transverse to the string is isometric to the surface of a cone with a deficit angle equal to @xmath18 .",
    "such space - times were known a long time ago ( m.  fierz , unpublished , see footnote in @xcite ) and were studied in detail in @xcite . in the present context , as cosmological objects appearing after phase transitions and under the name of cosmic strings , they were introduced in seminal works of kibble @xcite and vilenkin @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the interest to this subject is recently revived owing to the finding that many supergravity ( superstring ) models of inflation predict the production of cosmic strings at the end of inflationary phase @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings may also arize in other approaches such as string gas cosmology @xcite and dark matter strings @xcite .",
    "the nonvanishing of string tension ( 1 ) leads to various cosmological consequences and , among them , to a very distinctive gravitational lensing effect @xcite ( see @xcite for current discussion ) and to a specific form of discontinuities in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "namely the latter effect imposes the upper bound on the value of tension : @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as already mentioned , flux @xmath20 is nonvanishing for the strings corresponding to spontaneous breakdown of local ( continuous ) symmetries .",
    "if tension vanishes ( @xmath21 ) , then such a string becomes similar to a magnetic string , i.e. a tube of the magnetic flux lines in flat space .",
    "if the tube is impenetrable for quantum matter , then quantum effects outside the tube may depend on flux @xmath20 periodically with period @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the coupling constant  charge of the matter particle ) .",
    "this is known as the bohm - aharonov effect @xcite , which has no analogue in classical physics , since the classical motion of charged particles can not be affected by the magnetic flux from the impenetrable for the particles region .",
    "the natural question is , how the nonvanishing string tension ( @xmath24 ) influences quantum effects of the string .",
    "thus , the subject of cosmic strings , in addition to tantalizing phenomenological applications , acquires a certain conceptual importance .",
    "quantum - mechanical motion of charged particles in the background of a cosmic string was considered in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the effects of the second - quantized theory and consider the vacuum polarization which is induced by a cosmic string in quantum matter .",
    "the vacuum energy - momentum tensor in the cosmic string background was considered in @xcite , and our concern will be in the vacuum current in this background .",
    "we shall assume that the effects of the string core structure are negligible since the transverse size of the core is estimated to be of several orders less than the size of a proton and can be neglected ; thus our consideration will be restricted to idealized ( infinitely thin ) cosmic strings and some of the transverse size effects will be discussed afterwards . on the other hand , in view of the significance of high - dimensional space - times in various aspects , we shall deal with a generalization of a cosmic string to spaces of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "quantum matter will be represented by charged massive scalar field .",
    "the generalization of an idealized cosmic string to a @xmath25-dimensional space is given by a @xmath0-brane in the conical @xmath26)-dimensional space - time with squared length element @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are polar coordinates of conical surface , and @xmath30 are cartesian coordinates of flat @xmath0-dimensional space ; thus the spatial curvature is nonvanishing and singular in the @xmath0-brane ( i.e. , point in the @xmath31 case , line in the @xmath2 case , plane in the @xmath32 case , and @xmath0-hypersurface in the @xmath33 case ) . the gauge field strength ( bundle curvature )",

    "as it follows from our consideration , topological defects ( cosmic strings ) appearing in the aftermath of phase transitions can produce magnetic fields via the vacuum polarization .",
