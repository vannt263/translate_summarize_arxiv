    "quantum entanglement plays an essential role in many interesting quantum information protocols , such as in quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation @xcite . to faithfully realize these protocols ,",
    "first we need to generate a maximally entangled state . in reality , however , due to loss and decoherence , normally we can only generate partially entangled states between distant sides @xcite . entanglement purification is further needed which distills a maximally entangled state from several pairs of partially entangled states using local quantum operations and classical communications @xcite . for qubit systems , efficient entanglement purification protocols have been found @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum information protocols have been extended from qubit systems to continuous variable systems , such as continuous variable teleportation @xcite , continuous variable computation @xcite and error correction @xcite , continuous variable cryptography @xcite , and also the notions of continuous variable inseparability @xcite and bound entanglement @xcite have been investigated .",
    "for physical implementation , gaussian continuous variable entangled states ( i.e. , states whose wigner functions are gaussians ) can be generated experimentally by transmitting two - mode squeezed light , and this kind of entanglement has been demonstrated in the recent experiment of continuous variable teleportation @xcite . obviously , it is useful to consider purification of continuous variable entanglement , that is , to generate a desired more entangled state from some realistic continuous entangled states .",
    "we have recently proposed an efficient continuous variable entanglement purification protocol @xcite . in this paper , we present the mathematical details of this purification protocol together with new results on its physical implementation . in particular ,",
    "we take into account many important imperfections in a realistic experimental setup , and calculate their influence on the purification scheme .",
    "quantitative requirements are given for the relevant experimental parameters .",
    "these calculations make necessary preparations for a real experiment .",
    "we also show how to generate gaussian continuous entangled states between two distant high finesse cavities , which is the first step for the physical implementation of the purification protocol .",
    "it should be noted that with direct extensions of the purification protocols for qubit systems , it is possible to increase entanglement for a special class of less realistic continuous entangled states @xcite . unfortunately , with these direct extensions no entanglement increase has been found till now for realistic gaussian continuous entangled states . in @xcite",
    "a protocol to increase the entanglement for the special case of pure two - mode squeezed states has been proposed , which is based on conditional photon subtraction . for its practical realization ,",
    "the efficiency , however , seems to be an issue .",
    "in contrast , the purification scheme discussed in this paper has the following favorable properties : ( i ) for pure states it reaches the maximal allowed efficiency in the asymptotic limit ( when the number of pairs of modes goes to infinity ) ; ( ii ) it can be readily extended to distill maximally entangled states from a relevant class of mixed gaussian states which result from losses in the light transmission ; ( iii ) an experimental scheme is possible for physical implementation of the purification protocol using high finesse cavities and cross kerr nonlinearities .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section 2 we show how to generate a gaussian continuous entangled state between two distant cavities from the broadband squeezed light provided by a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) .",
    "light transmission loss is taken into account . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we give a detailed description of the purification protocol .",
    "section 3 shows how to generate a maximally entangled state from pure two - mode squeezed states based on a local quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of the total photon number , and section 4 extends the purification protocol to include the mixed gaussian continuous states which are evolved from the pure two - mode squeezed states due to the unavoidable light transmission loss . in section 5 , we describe a cavity scheme to realize the local qnd measurement of the total photon number , and deduce conditions for the qnd  measurement .",
    "then , in section 6 , we extensively discuss many imperfections for a real experiment on qnd  measurements , and deduce quantitative requirements for the relevant experimental parameters .",
    "last , we summarize the results , and give some typical parameter estimations .",
    "our source of entangled light field is taken to be a nopa operating below threshold @xcite .",
    "the light fields may be nondegenerate in polarization or in frequency .",
    "the two nopa cavity modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are assumed to have the same output coupling rate @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamic in the nopa cavity is described by the langevin equations ( in the rotating frame ) @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pumping rate with @xmath5 ( below threshold ) , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are vacuum inputs .",
    "the nopa outputs @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given respectively by @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "the two outputs , perhaps after a long distance propagation , are incident on distant high finesse cavities a and b. the cavities a and b are assumed to have the same damping rate @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "the schematic setup is shown by fig . 1 .    under the condition @xmath13 ,",
    "the dynamics in the nopa cavity is much faster than those in the cavities a and b , so we can assume a steady state for the nopa outputs .",
    "the steady nopa outputs are described by squeezed white noise operators with the following correlations @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 , satisfying @xmath17 , are determined by the nopa coupling and pumping rates through @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    to get the steady state of the cavities",
    "a and b , we note that their inputs @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the nopa outputs @xmath8 and @xmath9 with neglect of the losses during light propagation .",
    "the langevin equations for the cavity modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 have the form @xmath24 with the following solution @xmath25 when @xmath26 is considerably larger than @xmath27 , from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , it follows that @xmath28 on the other hand , we know that two modes driven by a white noise are in gaussian states at any time .",
    "a gaussian state with the correlations ( 4 ) is necessarily a pure two - mode squeezed state .",
    "so the steady state of the cavity modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 is @xmath29 where the squeezing operator @xmath30 $ ] and the squeezing parameter @xmath31 is determined by @xmath32    next we include some important sources of noise in the state generation process .",
    "the noise includes the losses in the nopa cavity and the light transmission loss from the nopa  cavity to the cavities a and b. with a small loss rate @xmath33 for the modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the nopa  cavity , the langevin equation ( 1 ) is replaced by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are standard vacuum white noise , and the nopaoutputs are still given by @xmath37 @xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand , the transmission loss of light can be described by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the transmission time , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are respectively the transmission loss rates for the outputs @xmath8 and @xmath42 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are standard vacuum white noise . from eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , it follows that the inputs for the cavities a and b have the following correlations    @xmath45    where the total loss rates @xmath46 @xmath11 , and the parameter @xmath47 .",
    "the steady state of the two cavity modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 is thus a gaussian state with the non - zero correlations given by @xmath48 the gaussian state is completely determined by these correlations . the gaussian state ( 8) can be equivalently described as the solution at time @xmath49 of the following master equation @xmath50 with the initial state @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is defined by eq .",
    "this equivalence simplifies the physical picture in section 4 , where we will use the master equation ( 9 ) to describe the state generation noise .",
    "in the above , we have shown how to generate continuous partially entangled states between two distant cavities . in the case of no noise in the state generation process ,",
    "the cavities are in a pure two - mode squeezed state . in this section",
    ", we will show how to concentrate continuous variable entanglement , that is , starting from several pairs of continuous entangled states , we want to get a state with more entanglement through only local operations .",
    "the section is divided into two parts .",
    "the first part describes the purification protocol for two entangled pairs , and the second part extends the protocol to include multiple pairs .",
    "assume now we have two cavities @xmath53 and @xmath54 on each side .",
    "each pair of cavities @xmath55 @xmath56 are prepared in the state ( 5 ) , which is now denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 , expressed in the number basis , has the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "equation ( 10 ) is just the schmidt decomposition of the state @xmath58 . for a pure state ,",
    "the entanglement is uniquely quantified by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator of its one - component .",
    "the entanglement of the state ( 10 ) is thus expressed as @xmath61 the joint state of the two entangled pairs @xmath62 and @xmath63 is simply the product @xmath64 where @xmath65 is defined as @xmath66    we now perform a local qnd measurement of the total photon number of the two cavities @xmath53 .",
    "there have been several proposals for doing qnd measurements of the photon number , and in section 5 , we will describe a cavity scheme for realizing the qnd measurement of the total photon number of two local cavities .",
    "here we simply assume this type of measurement can be done .",
    "after the qnd measurement of the total number @xmath67 , the state @xmath68 is collapsed into @xmath65 with probability @xmath69 the state @xmath65 is a maximally entangled state between the two parties @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 in a @xmath70-dimensional hilbert space , and its entanglement is @xmath71 if @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 , we get a two - party state with more entanglement .",
    "the quantity @xmath74 defines the entanglement increase ratio .",
    "2 shows the probability of success versus entanglement increase ratio for some typical values of the squeezing parameter .",
    "an interesting feature of this entanglement purification protocol is that with any measurement outcome @xmath75 , we always get a useful maximally entangled state in some finite hilbert space , though the entanglement of the outcome state @xmath65 does not necessarily exceed that of the original state @xmath76 if @xmath77 is small .",
    "the state @xmath78 involves two pairs of cavities .",
    "if one wants to transfer the entanglement to a single pair of cavity modes , one can make a phase measurement of the cavity mode @xmath79 .",
    "there have been some proposals for doing a phase measurement @xcite .",
    "a phase measurement of the mode @xmath80 with the measurement outcome @xmath81 will convert the state @xmath82 to the following maximally entangled state of a single pair of cavity modes @xmath83      the above protocol can be extended straightforwardly to simultaneously concentrate entanglement of multiple cavity - pairs .",
    "simultaneous concentration of multiple entangled pairs is much more effective that the entanglement concentration two by two .",
    "assume that we have @xmath84 cavity - pairs @xmath85 , @xmath63 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "each pair of cavities @xmath55 is prepared in the state ( 10 ) .",
    "the joint state of the @xmath84 entangled pairs can be expressed as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is abbreviation of@xmath90 , @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath87 , and the normalized state @xmath93 is defined as @xmath94 the function @xmath95 in eqs .",
    "( 17 ) and ( 18 ) is given by @xmath96 to concentrate the entanglement , we perform a qnd measurement of the total photon number @xmath97 .",
    "this measurement projects the state @xmath98 onto a two - party maximally entangled state @xmath99 with probability @xmath100 the entanglement of the outcome state @xmath99 is given by @xmath101 similarly , @xmath102 defines the entanglement increase ratio , and if @xmath103 , we get a more entangled state . for four pairs , the probability of success versus entanglement increase ratio",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "3 . there appears a peak in the probability curve for some entanglement increase ratio between @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    to measure how efficient the scheme is ,",
    "we define the entanglement transfer efficiency @xmath106 with the expression @xmath107 it is the ratio of the average entanglement after concentration measurement to the initial total entanglement contained in the @xmath84 pairs .",
    "obviously , @xmath108 should always hold . with the squeezing parameter @xmath109 @xmath110 or @xmath111 the entanglement transfer efficiency versus the number of pairs @xmath84",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "4 .    from the figure",
    ", we see that the entanglement transfer efficiency is near to 1 for a large number of pairs .",
    "in fact , it can be proven that if @xmath84 goes to infinity , with unit probability we would get a maximally entangled state with entanglement @xmath112 to show this , we calculate the mean value and the variance of the distribution @xmath113 , and find @xmath114 the results show that if @xmath84 tends to infinity , @xmath115  and the distribution @xmath116 tends to a @xmath117-like function .",
    "furthermore , around the mean value @xmath118 , the entanglement of the resulting state @xmath119 is @xmath120 so the entanglement transfer efficiency tends to unity .",
    "this proves that the purification method described above is optimal in the asymptotic limit ( @xmath121 ) , analogous to the purification protocol presented in @xcite for the qubit case . for any finite number of entangled pairs ,",
    "this purification protocol is more efficient than that in @xcite , since it takes advantage of the special relations between the coefficients in the two - mode squeezed state .",
    "the assumption of noise - free preparation of partially continuous entangled states is not realistic . if we include the unavoidable light transmission loss and the nopa cavity loss in the state generation process , in section 2 we have shown that we would get a mixed gaussian continuous entangled state between two distant cavities .",
    "the state is described by the solution at the transmission time @xmath39 of the master equation ( 9 ) , with the ideal two - mode squeezed state ( 10 ) at the beginning . if we want to establish @xmath84 entangled cavity - pairs @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath86 and @xmath122 , eq .",
    "( 9 ) can be extended directly to the following form @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the density operator of the whole @xmath84 entangled pairs with @xmath125 , and the effective hamiltonian @xmath126 in eqs .",
    "( 25 ) and ( 26 ) , we assumed that the total loss rates @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the same for the @xmath84 entangled pairs , but @xmath129 and @xmath128 may be different from each other . in this section , we will show how to distill entanglement from the kind of realistic continuous entangled states described by the solution of the master equation ( 25 ) .",
    "there are two practical circumstances in which our entanglement purification protocol can be extended straightforwardly to generate maximally entangled states from the mixed gaussian entangled states .",
    "we describe these two circumstances one by one .      though the state preparation noise is unavoidable , in many cases it is reasonable to assume that it is quite small .",
    "we take @xmath130 and @xmath131 as small factors , and solve the master equation ( 25 ) perturbatively to the first order of these small factors .",
    "it is convenient to use the quantum trajectory language to explain the perturbative solution . in this language , to the first order of @xmath132 and @xmath131 , the final normalized state of the @xmath84 entangled pairs is either ( no jumps ) @xmath133 with probability @xmath134 or ( a jump occurred ) @xmath135 with probability @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the mean photon number for a single mode .",
    "similar to the pure state case , we also use qnd  measurements of the total photon number to distill entanglement from the mixed continuous state described by eqs .",
    "( 27)-(30 ) .",
    "the difference is that now we perform qnd measurements on both sides a and b. the measurement results are denoted by @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "we then compare @xmath140 and @xmath139 through classical communication , and keep the outcome state if and only if @xmath141 .",
    "it is easy to show that the final state is a maximally entangled state in a finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath142 and @xmath143 denote the projections onto the eigenspace of the corresponding total number operator @xmath144 and @xmath145 with eigenvalue @xmath77 , respectively . from eqs .",
    "( 27 ) and ( 29 ) , it follows @xmath146 so if @xmath147 , the outcome state is maximally entangled with entanglement @xmath148 .",
    "the components ( 29 ) in the mixed density operator , which are not maximally entangled , are discarded through confirmation of the two - side measurement outcomes .",
    "compared with the pure state case , the probability to get the entangled state @xmath149 is now decreased to @xmath150 we also note that the projection operators @xmath151 can not eliminate the state obtained from the initial state @xmath98 by a quantum jump on both sides a and b. the total probability for this kind of quantum jumps to occur is proportional to @xmath152 .",
    "so the condition for small state preparation noise in fact requires @xmath153 if the light transmission loss is the dominant noise , eq .",
    "( 33 ) reduces to @xmath154 .      in the above purification protocol , we need classical communication ( cc ) to confirm that the measurement outcomes of the two sides are the same , and during this cc , we implicitly assume that the storage noise for the cavity modes is negligible .",
    "in fact , that the storage noise during cc is much smaller than the transmission noise is a common assumption made in all the entanglement purification schemes which need the help of repeated ccs @xcite .",
    "if we also make this assumption for continuous variable systems , there exists a simple purification protocol to generate maximally entangled states .",
    "we put the nopa setup on the a side .",
    "after creation of ideal squeezed vacuum lights , we directly couple one output light of the nopa to the cavity on side a without noisy propagation ; and the other output of the nopa is sent to the remote side b , through a long distance noisy transmission .",
    "this configuration of the setup is equivalent to setting the transmission loss rate @xmath155 so that @xmath156 .",
    "note that the nopa cavity loss rate @xmath157 is normally much smaller than the output coupling rate @xmath2 , so the total loss rate @xmath129 can be much smaller than @xmath128 in this case .",
    "the purification protocol now is exactly the same as that described in the previous case .",
    "we note that the component of the mixed density operator which is kept the projection @xmath158 should subject to the same times of quantum jumps on each side a and b. we want this component is a maximally entangled state .",
    "this requires that the total probability for a and b to be subjected to the same nonzero number of quantum jumps should be very small . from eq .",
    "( 30 ) , this total probability is always smaller than @xmath159 , no matter how large the transmission loss @xmath160 is .",
    "so the working condition of the protocol in the asymmetric transmission noise case is @xmath161 the transmission loss @xmath160 can be above one .",
    "the probability of success for obtaining the maximally entangled state @xmath162 is also given by eq .",
    "( 32 ) .    before concluding this section",
    ", we remark that for continuous variable systems , the information carrier is normally light , and the assumption of storage with a very small loss rate is typically unrealistic . it is interesting to note that recently there have been proposals to store light in internal states of an atomic ensemble @xcite .",
    "if this turns out to be possible , the storage time for light can be greatly increased . anyway , as was pointed out in @xcite , this purification method is in fact not essentially hampered by the difficulty to store light , since there is a simple posterior confirmation method to circumvent the storage problem . note that the purpose to distill maximally entangled states is to directly apply them in some quantum communication protocol , such as in quantum cryptography or in quantum teleportation .",
    "so we can modify the above purification protocol by the following procedure : right after the cavity a attains its steady state , we make a qnd measurement of the total excitation number on side a and get a measurement result @xmath140 .",
    "then we do not store the outcome state on side a , but immediately use it ( e.g. , perform the corresponding measurement as required by a quantum cryptography protocol ) . during this process",
    ", the modes @xmath163 are being sent to the distant side b , and when they arrive , we make another qnd measurement of the total excitation number of the modes @xmath163 and get a outcome @xmath139 .",
    "the resulting state on side b can be directly used ( for quantum cryptography for instance ) if @xmath164 and discarded otherwise . by this method",
    ", we formally get maximally entangled states through posterior confirmation , and at the same time we need not store the modes on both sides .",
    "the qnd measurement of the total photon number plays a critical role in our entanglement purification protocol .",
    "there have been some proposals for making a qnd  measurement of the photon number in a single cavity @xcite , such as letting some atoms pass through the cavity , and measuring the internal or external degrees of freedom of the atoms @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we propose a purely optical scheme for making a qnd measurement of the total photon number contained in several cavities .",
    "the different optical modes interact with each other through cross phase modulation induced by a kerr medium , and we use cavities to enhance this kind of interaction . as an illustrative example",
    ", in the following we will show how to measure the total photon number of two cavities .",
    "extension of this scheme to include several cavities is straightforward .",
    "the schematic setup is depicted in fig .",
    "we want to make a qndmeasurement of the total photon number @xmath165 contained in the good cavities i and ii , whose damping rate @xmath12 is assumed to be very small .",
    "the cavities i and ii , each with a kerr type medium inside , are put respectively in a bigger ring cavity .",
    "the two ring cavities are assumed to damp at the same rate @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "a strong coherent light @xmath168 is incident on the first ring cavity , whose output @xmath169 is directed to the second ring cavity .",
    "the output @xmath170 of the second ring cavity is continuously observed through homodyne detection , and we will show that under some realistic conditions , this detection gives a qnd measurement of the total photon number operator @xmath171 .    the measurement model depicted in fig .",
    "5 is an example of a cascaded quantum system @xcite.the incident light @xmath168 can be expressed as @xmath172 where @xmath173 is a constant driving field , and @xmath174 is the standard vacuum white noise , satisfying @xmath175 the hamiltonian for the kerr medium is assumed to be @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the annihilation operators for the ring cavity modes , and @xmath179 is the cross - phase modulation coefficient .",
    "the self - phase modulation effects will be discussed in the next section and shown to be negligible under some realistic conditions . in the rotating frame ,",
    "the langevin equations describing the dynamics in the two ring cavities have the form @xmath180 the boundary conditions for the two ring cavities are described by @xmath181 assume @xmath182 @xmath183 , and we take adiabatic elimination , i.e. , let @xmath184 in eq .",
    "( 38 ) , obtaining @xmath185 substituting the above result into eq .",
    "( 39 ) , the final output field @xmath170 is expressed as @xmath186    now we measure the @xmath187-component of the quadrature phase amplitudes of the output field @xmath170 through a homodyne detection .",
    "the phase of the driving field @xmath188 is set according to @xmath189 .",
    "suppose @xmath190 is the measuring time .",
    "what we really get is the integrated photon current over time @xmath190 , which , divided by @xmath191 corresponds to the following measuring operator @xmath192 dt   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}\\left| g\\right| \\chi } { \\sqrt{\\gamma } } \\left ( n_{1}+n_{2}\\right ) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}}x_{t}^{\\left ( b\\right ) } ,   \\eqnum{42}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath193 , and @xmath194 , satisfying @xmath195 = 1 $ ] , is defined by @xmath196 from eq .",
    "( 36 ) , it follows that the defined mode @xmath194 is in a vacuum state .",
    "so the first term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 42 ) represents the signal which is proportional to @xmath165 , and the second term represents the contribution of the vacuum noise .",
    "the distinguishability of this measurement is given by @xmath197 if @xmath198 , i.e. , if the measuring time @xmath199 we perform an effective measurement of the total number operator @xmath200 . during the measuring time @xmath190 , the loss of the two cavities i and ii should be negligible , which requires @xmath201 under this condition , @xmath165 is approximately a conserved observable , and we realize a qnd measurement of the total photon number operator@xmath202 the measurement projects the field in the cavities i and ii to one of the eigenstates of @xmath165 . eqs .",
    "( 45 ) and ( 46 ) , combined together , determine the suitable choice for the measuring time .",
    "we have shown how to perform a qnd  measurement of the total photon number . the scheme described above works under ideal conditions . for a real experiment , there are always many imperfections which should be considered . for example , the phase of the driving field may be unstable , and has a small variance ; the damping rates and the cross phase modulation coefficients for different ring cavities may not be exactly the same ; the kerr media and the mirrors may absorb some light ; self - phase modulation effects caused by the kerr media may have some influence on the resulting state ; there may be some loss of light from the first ring cavity to the second ring cavity ; the efficiency of the detector is not unity .",
    "of course , to realize a qndmeasurement of the total photon number , all the imperfections must be small .",
    "but the important question is how small these imperfections should be . in this section",
    ", we will deduce quantitative requirements for all the imperfections listed above .",
    "these calculations may be helpful for a future real experiment .",
    "we will consider these imperfections one by one .",
    "assume that the phase of the driving field @xmath173 has a small variance @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath188 is expressed as @xmath203 .",
    "then , eq . ( 42 ) is replaced by @xmath204 the last term of eq . ( 47 ) represents the noise due to the phase instability of the driving field .",
    "it should be negligible compared with the signal , which requires @xmath205 on the other hand , we know that the squared phase variance @xmath206 increases linearly with time , i.e. @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the increasing rate .",
    "the measuring time @xmath190 is bounded from below by eq .",
    "( 45 ) , so the increasing rate of the phase instability of the driving field is required to satisfy @xmath209 eq .",
    "( 49 ) suggests it is easier to meet the requirement imposed by the phase instability with a strong driving field and a large cross phase modulation coefficient .      in the previous section",
    ", we assumed that the damping rates and the cross phase modulation coefficients are exactly the same for the two ring cavities",
    ". this may be impossible in a real experiment .",
    "here we calculate the largest allowed imbalance between the two ring cavities . the damping rates and the cross phase modulation coefficients for the ring cavities",
    "are denoted by @xmath210 @xmath211 and @xmath212 @xmath213 , respectively .",
    "the langevin equations ( 38 ) and the boundary conditions ( 39 ) are replaced respectively by the following equations @xmath214 @xmath215 the final measured observable is expressed as @xmath216 the last term of eq .",

    "the boundary conditions for the ring cavities are still described by eq .",
    "( 39 ) . the leaked ( or absorbed ) light fields @xmath223 and @xmath224 are expressed as @xmath225 the leakage ( or absorption ) of light may have two types of effects : first , it may destroy the balance between the two ring cavities ; and second , the leaked light ( 55 ) may carry some information about @xmath226 ( or @xmath227 ) .",
    "any information about @xmath226 ( or @xmath227 ) will destroy the superposition of the different eigenstates of @xmath226 ( or @xmath227 ) , and thus lead to decoherence of the eigenstate of @xmath165 ( note that a eigenstate of @xmath165 is normally a superposition of the different eigenstates of @xmath226 ( or @xmath228 ) ) .",
    "so we require that the information about @xmath226 ( or @xmath227 ) carried by the leaked light should be completely masked by the vacuum noise .",
    "this is equivalent to require that the decoherence of the eigenstate of @xmath229 caused by the light leakage is negligible . to consider the first effect of the light leakage , we calculate the measured observable @xmath230 , and find it has the form @xmath231 the last term of eq . ( 56 )",

    "( 42 ) , are standard vacuum noise terms .",
    "the last term of eq . ( 58 ) bears some information about @xmath237 , which should be completely masked by the vacuum noise term to make the decoherence effect negligible .",
    "this condition requires @xmath238 on the other hand , the measuring time @xmath190 is bounded from below by eq .",
    "( 45 ) , which , combined with eq .",
    "( 59 ) , yields the following requirement for the leakage rates @xmath239 obviously , this is a much stronger requirement than that given by eq .",
    "( 57 ) .",
    "we should mention that there is another kind of absorption by the kerr medium , the absorption rate of which is proportional to the cavity photon number @xmath237 .",
    "this kind of absorption , usually termed two - photon absorption , can not be described by eq .",
    "( 54 ) . to incorporate the two - photon absorption ,",
    "we add an imaginary part to the cross phase modulation coefficient @xmath179 , i.e. , @xmath179 is replaced by @xmath240 , where @xmath241 describes the two - photon absorption rate .",
    "the two - photon absorption should be negligible compared with the cross kerr interaction , which requires @xmath242",
    "@xmath243      normally , a kerr medium also induces self - phase modulation effects .",
    "however , by a suitable choice of the resonance condition for the kerr medium , the self - phase modulation effects can be made much smaller than the cross - phase modulation @xcite , then the self phase modulation interaction is basically negligible . here , for completeness , we still calculate the influence of self - phase modulations .",
    "in fact , self - phase modulation of the ring cavity modes have no influence on the qnd measurement .",
    "this modulation adds a term like @xmath244 @xmath183 in the langevin equation ( 38 ) , where @xmath245 denotes the self - phase modulation coefficient for the ring cavity modes .",
    "we know that the ring cavity modes @xmath177 and @xmath178 are in steady states under adiabatic elimination , and to a good approximation @xmath246 can be replaced by @xmath247 .",
    "so the term @xmath244 simply induces a constant phase shift for the output field @xmath170 , and it can be easily compensated by choosing the initial phase of the driving field @xmath188 .",
    "self phase modulation of the cavity modes @xmath248 and @xmath249 plays a more subtle role .",
    "first , it obviously has no influence on the qnd  measurement of @xmath165 , but it influences the resulting state after the qnd measurement . in the purification scheme for two entangled pairs ( described in section iii.a ) , if there is no self - phase modulation , the state after the qnd measurement is given by eq .",
    "( 13 ) ; and if the self - phase modulation of the modes @xmath248 and @xmath249 is considered , the modulation hamiltonian @xmath250 @xmath56 , in which @xmath251 is the corresponding self phase modulation coefficient , will bring the resulting state into    @xmath252 } \\left| n , j - n\\right\\rangle _ { a_{1}a_{2}}\\left| n , j - n\\right\\rangle _ { b_{1}b_{2 } } ,   \\eqnum{61 }   \\label{60}\\ ] ]    where @xmath253 is the interaction time for the self phase modulation .",
    "it is important to note that the state ( 61 ) is still a maximally entangled state with entanglement @xmath254 . in this sense ,",
    "self - phase modulation effects have no influence on the entanglement purification , though the resulting state is changed .",
    "if the coupling between the two ring cavities is not perfect , the relation @xmath255 is not valid any more , and should be replaced by @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the standard vacuum white noise , and @xmath258 represents the leaked light in the imperfect coupling .",
    "the quantity @xmath259 describes the coupling efficiency .",
    "this kind of imperfection is very similar to the light leakage ( or absorption ) described in subsection vi.c .",
    "the difference is that the imperfect coupling ( 62 ) does not cause any unbalance between the two ring cavities .",
    "the only restriction is that the decoherence effect induced by it should be negligible , which requires    @xmath260    eq .",
    "( 63 ) suggests that loss of light from the first to the second ring cavity should be very small .",
    "the detector efficiency of course can not attain @xmath27 . for a detector with efficiency @xmath261",
    ", the real measured field @xmath262 has the following relation with the output of the second ring cavity @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the standard vacuum white noise .",
    "this imperfection is similar to the imperfect coupling considered in the previous subsection .",
    "but now the leaked light depends only on the operator sum @xmath165 , and carries no information about the single cavity photon number @xmath226 , so it does not induce any decoherence .",
    "the only role played by the detector inefficiency is that it decreases the signal by a factor @xmath265 , so eq . ( 45 ) on the restriction of the measuring time is now replaced by @xmath266 obviously , the detector inefficiency has no important influence on this qnd measurement scheme .",
    "in summary , we have given a detailed description of the purification protocol which generates maximally entangled states in a finite dimensional hilbert space from two - mode squeezed states or from realistic gaussian continuous entangled states .",
    "the nonlocal gaussian continuous entangled states are generated by feeding two distant cavities with the outputs of the nopa .",
    "the purification operation is based on a local qnd measurement of the total photon number contained in several cavities .",
    "we have extensively analyzed a cavity scheme to do this qnd measurement , and have deduced its working condition .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed many imperfections existing in a real experiment , and deduced quantitative requirements for the relevant experimental parameters . in tab . 1",
    ", we summarize the working conditions for the collective qnd measurement , including the requirements for many types of imperfections .       to realize the qnd measurement , basically we need high finesse optical cavities and strong cross kerr interaction media .",
    "a good example for the strong cross kerr interaction is provided by the resonantly enhanced kerr nonlinearity , which has been predicted theoretically @xcite and demonstrated in recent experiments @xcite . in those works ,",
    "the kerr medium is a low density cold trapped atomic gas , whose relevant energy level structure is represented by the four - state diagram shown in fig .",
    "6 with @xmath267 being the ground state .",
    "the ring cavity mode @xmath268 with frequency @xmath269 is assumed to be resonant with the @xmath270 transition , and the cavity mode @xmath271 with frequency @xmath272 ( @xmath272 is quite different from @xmath269 ) is coupled to the @xmath273 transition , but with a large detuning @xmath274 .",
    "a nonperturbative classical coupling field with frequency @xmath275 resonant with the @xmath276 transition creates an electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) for the cavity fields @xmath271 and @xmath268 .    in this configuration , the one - photon absorption of the medium",
    "is eliminated due to quantum interference , and the cross kerr nonlinearity is only limited by the two - photon absorption ( the self kerr nonlinearity is negligible provided that @xmath277 ) .",
    "after adiabatically eliminating all the atomic levels , the cross phase modulation coefficient is given by @xcite @xmath278 where @xmath279 and @xmath280 are the coupling coefficients between the atoms and the cavity modes @xmath271 and @xmath268 , respectively , @xmath281 denotes the rabi frequency of the coupling field , and @xmath282 is the total atom number contained in the cavity . the two - photon absorption rate @xmath283 is connected with @xmath179 by the relation @xmath284 , where @xmath285 is the spontaneous emission rate from level @xmath286 to level @xmath287 . to justify the adiabatic elimination , one requires that @xmath288 @xcite . as an estimation ,",
    "if one takes @xmath289 @xmath290mhz , @xmath291mhz , and @xmath292 , the coefficient @xmath179 is about @xmath293mhz , and the two - photon absorption rate @xmath294 .",
    "this value of the cross phase modulation coefficient @xmath179 is not large enough to realize a single - photon turnstile device @xcite , but it is enough for performing qnd measurements of the photon number .",
    "for example , if the mean photon number @xmath295 with the squeezing parameter @xmath296 , we choose the decay rates @xmath297mhz and @xmath298mhz ( these values for decay rates are obtainable in current experiments ) , and let @xmath299 ( for a cavity with cross area @xmath300@xmath301 , @xmath299 corresponds to a coherent driving light with intensity about @xmath302mw@xmath303 ) . with the above parameters , all the requirements listed in tab .",
    "1 can be satisfied if we choose the measuring time @xmath304ns .",
    "note that the light speed can be much reduced in the eit medium @xcite , so it is possible to get a reduced cavity decay rate @xmath12 with the same finesse mirrors , and then more favorable parameters can be given for the qnd measurement .",
    "note also that a large kerr nonlinearity based on eit can also be obtained in other systems , such as trapping a single atom in a high finesse cavity @xcite .",
    "so the example discussed here is not the unique choice .",
