    "recent interest in mach - like conical di - jet correlations @xcite is due to suggestions @xcite that a measurement of the dependence of the cone angle on the supersonic jet velocity @xmath0 could provide via mach s law ( @xmath1 ) a constraint on the average speed of sound in the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) @xcite created at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . in refs .",

    "this ads / cft motivated model provides a detailed holographic description of the induced stress tensor @xcite in the wake of a heavy quark jet moving at a constant velocity through a static strongly - coupled @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) background plasma at finite temperature @xmath3 . direct tests of this ads / cft string drag model using the ratio of bottom to charm nuclear modification factors in high energy nuclear collisions at rhic and lhc have been proposed in ref . @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on another observable : the hadron correlations associated with tagged identified heavy quark jets .",
    "the ads / cft stress solution for a supersonic heavy quark @xcite features the expected far zone mach cone as well as a strong forward moving diffusion wake .",
    "the far zone response is well described in the strong coupling limit of an @xmath2 sym plasma by a `` minimal '' shear viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath4 @xcite ( near the uncertainty principle limit @xcite ) . however , in @xcite it was noted that the strong forward diffusion wake in the far zone of the ads / cft solution could spoil the double - shoulder signature of the mach wake in accord with the general discussion of far zone hydrodynamics in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in the strict supergravity limit , @xmath5 but @xmath6 , in fact the far zone wakes have such small amplitudes that they only lead to a single broad peak in the away - side hadronic correlation after cooper - frye ( cf ) freeze - out of the fluid @xcite .",
    "however , the ads / cft string drag solution features a novel nonequilibrium `` neck '' near zone , where especially strong transverse flow relative to the jet axis induces an apparent conical azimuthal correlation of associated hadrons even after cf thermal broadening at freeze - out .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the neck zone was defined as the region near the heavy quark where the local knudsen number @xcite is @xmath7 . where @xmath8 is the momentum flow field of matter and @xmath9 is the sound attenuation length , which is bounded from below for ultra - relativistic systems @xcite . in the neck region",

    "in addition , very near the quark the self coulomb field of the heavy quark contributes with a singular stress @xmath13 @xcite .    the above strong coupling ads / cft results motivated us in the present work to study whether similar novel near zone field - plasma dynamical coupling effects arise in weakly coupled perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite the heavy quark jet induced stress in a weakly - coupled qgp ( wqgp in contrast to sqgp ) was computed analytically in the linear response approximation based on the asakawa - bass - mller ( abm ) @xcite generalization of chromo - viscous hydrodynamics @xcite .",

    "when one of the jets is produced near the surface ( the trigger jet ) , the other supersonic away - side jet moves through the plasma and generates in the far zone a mach like conical perturbation in the plasma stress as seen in fig.1 . the resulting conical correlation ( with respect to the away - side jet axis )",
    "is naturally expected to lead to an enhancement of associated hadrons at the characteristic mach angle @xcite . below some transverse momentum saturation scale @xcite ,",
    "jet physics depends on the properties of the medium and one can test different models of jet - medium coupling dynamics by studying the detailed angular and rapidity correlations . in this work we demonstrate a striking difference between strongly coupled ads / cft and moderate coupling , multiple collision pqcd transport models for that coupling , and study their experimentally neasurable consequences .",

    "<S> we propose an identified heavy quark jet observable to discriminate between weakly coupled pqcd and strongly coupled ads / cft models of quark gluon plasma dynamics in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions at rhic and lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> these models are shown to predict qualitatively different associated hadron correlations with respect to tagged heavy quark jets . </S>",
    "<S> while both models feature similar far zone mach and diffusion wakes , the far zone stress features are shown to be too weak to survive thermal broadening at hadron freeze - out . however , these models differ significantly in a near zone `` neck '' region where strong chromo - fields sourced by the heavy quark jet couple to the polarizable plasma . conical associated correlations , </S>",
    "<S> if any , are shown to be dominated by the jet induced transverse flow in the neck zone and unrelated to the weak far zone wakes . unlike in ads </S>",
    "<S> / cft , we show that the induced transverse flow in the neck zone is too weak in pqcd to produce conical correlations after cooper - frye freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of conical correlations violating mach s law would favor the strongly - coupled ads / cft string drag dynamics , while their absence would favor weakly - coupled pqcd - based chromo - hydrodynamics . </S>"
