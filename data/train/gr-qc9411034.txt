    "<S> recently , it has been claimed that the back reaction of vacuum polarization on a black hole spacetime naturally regularizes infinities in the black hole entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the back reaction calculation and find no such short - distance cut - off , in contradiction with these recent claims . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the intuitive expectation that the perturbative calculation breaks down near the event horizon is confirmed . </S>",
    "<S> the new surface gravity diverges and the metric is degenerate at the stretched horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been claimed@xcite that the back - reaction on a black hole spacetime due to vacuum polarization provides a cut - off needed to regularize the entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the 1-loop quantum correction to the entropy from a scalar field near the event horizon diverges , as shown by t hooft @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence results since an infinite number of states can contribute at the horzion . </S>",
    "<S> one might conjecture that if a particle could never actually reach the event horizon , then only a finite number of states would contribute to the entropy and the infinites would be regularized . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , lousto claims to have found such a brick wall by computing the back reaction due to vacuum polarization on the spacetime . in the corrected metric , he argues , the acceleration required to keep a particle at rest vanishes at some distance outside the stretched horizon and at that point a particle can remain in stable equilibrium . therefore a natural barrier , and hence a short - distance cut - off , arises . </S>",
    "<S> we critically examine this claim and arrive at contrary conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the back - reaction - corrected metric has a new event horizon , stretched by an amount proportional to the planck length outside the unperturbed horizon . </S>",
    "<S> unlike in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there is no barrier to reaching the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration required to keep a particle stationary never vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the acceleration diverges at the stretched horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the new surface gravity diverges as well . </S>",
    "<S> not surprisingly , we also find that our perturbative calculation fails before the horizon can be reached . in short , </S>",
    "<S> this perturbative back - reaction calculation is unable to shed light on the physics near the event horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> following the method employed by lousto in ref.@xcite , we consider the back reaction due to a conformally invariant scalar field in the boulware vacuum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop renormalised energy momentum tensor in the spacetime of a schwarzschild black hole is  @xcite ( g = c=1 , h@xmath0 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 the expression in eqn.([1 ] ) differs from that calculated in the hartle - hawking thermal state  @xcite @xmath3 ( often misleadingly referred to as a vacuum state ) by a purely thermal contribution from the bath of hawking radiation , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the stephan - boltzman constant , @xmath6 is the temperature of the black hole as measured by a static observer at radial position @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the usual hawking temperature . the boulware vacuum and the hartle - hawking thermal state </S>",
    "<S> are both time - reversal invariant and thus suffer no particle production . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we are only considering the back - reaction due to vacuum polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> a more realistic calculation of back - reaction effects would require us to use the unruh vacuum  @xcite which allows for particle production and fluxes of energy - momentum due to hawking radiation . </S>",
    "<S> however , we shall confine our current analysis to back - reaction in the boulware vacuum in order to critically examine the results in ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> choosing the schwarzschild gauge , the metric for a static spherically symmetric spacetime is @xmath9 einstein s equations yield@xcite @xmath10 and @xmath11 the quantity @xmath12 represents the total mass due to the vacuum energy and the black hole as measured by asymptotic observers . in order to parallel the treatment in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the unperturbed black hole mass . </S>",
    "<S> still , it is unclear that this assumption can be justified . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps it could be argued that since no matter has been added or removed , the mass should not change . </S>",
    "<S> however , when using the hartle - hawking thermal state , it is certainly incorrect to equate @xmath12 and @xmath14 since radiation has been added to the system@xcite .    inserting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) into eq .  ( [ 3 ] ) , with @xmath15 , gives @xmath16~ , \\label{5}\\ ] ] where we differ from lousto s expression for @xmath17 in ref@xcite in the third and sixth terms . </S>",
    "<S> it is the sign difference in the sixth term which accounts for the majority of the differences between our work and that in ref@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath17 vanishes at @xmath18 where @xmath19 the leading correction to the position of the event horizon , @xmath20 , is proportional to @xmath21 , so the stretched horizon at @xmath22 is roughly a planck length from the unperturbed horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> in the neighbourhood of @xmath22 we find @xmath17 approaches zero linearly , @xmath23 the above equation exhibits the important feature that the limit @xmath24 is _ non - analytic _ in the neighborhood of @xmath22 since @xmath25 while for the uncorrected metric with @xmath26 we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 this is a clear sign that our perturbation theory breaks down at @xmath22 as our results are no longer analytic ( perturbative ) in @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this can easily be understood by considering the energy momentum tensor near the horizon and noticing that it diverges as @xmath7 approaches @xmath30 due to the redshift factor to the fourth power . </S>",
    "<S> this factor of @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath32 at the stretched horizon @xmath22 , and has the effect of canceling the overall small expansion parameter @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy is no longer a small perturbation near the horizon and our approximation scheme breaks down .    </S>",
    "<S> continuing our analysis , despite our misgivings , we proceed to calculate the metric function @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the integral in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4 ] ) is difficult to evaluate in closed form and we were only able to obtain explicit expressions for @xmath33 when @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the restriction @xmath36 occurs because the integrand is singular at @xmath22 . with these restrictions we find @xmath37+{\\cal o}(\\alpha^2 ) , \\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to evaluate the integral in the neighborhood of @xmath22 we employed the method of steepest descents and found that @xmath33 near @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 the constant @xmath40 is an uninteresting numerical factor . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath33 does vanish at @xmath38 , showing that @xmath22 is indeed the position of the new event horizon .    to complement the above analytic expressions for @xmath33 in the regions @xmath41 and @xmath42 we display a numerical evaluation of @xmath33 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . for the choice @xmath43 . this value of @xmath29 was chosen to facilitate comparison with lousto s plot of @xmath33 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . of ref.@xcite where by contrast @xmath33 fails to pass through zero but rather reaches a minimum before asymptoting to @xmath44 as @xmath7 approaches @xmath30 .    considering the equations of motion for a radially </S>",
    "<S> directed test particle with unit energy at spatial infinity , we find the coordinate velocity is given by @xmath45 according to ref.@xcite , fig . 1 . , a `` brick wall '' is encountered just outside of @xmath46 at the point where @xmath47 and the coordinate velocity vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous `` brick wall '' is also said to exist for strings , membranes and scalar fields , thus providing an ultraviolet cut - off for entropy calculations . from our analytic expressions ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a2 ] ) , and the numerical evaluation displayed in our fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> we see @xmath48 and no `` brick wall '' is encountered .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also stated in ref.@xcite that the coordinate acceleration , @xmath49 , vanishes at the `` brick wall '' , allowing particles to be placed in stable equilibrium ( @xmath50 ) just outside the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> we disagree with that assertion . in order to remain stationary against the pull of the black hole , </S>",
    "<S> an observer must be accelerated by amount @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the norm of the timelike killing vector @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the acceleration can be written in terms of the metric components as @xmath54 we see that neither the proper acceleration @xmath55 , nor the coordinate acceleration @xmath56 vanish outside of @xmath38 . </S>",

    "<S> explicitly , we find @xmath59 and @xmath60 to leading order in @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration not only does not vanish , but actually diverges near @xmath46 .    to complete our analysis </S>",
    "<S> we shall calculate the surface gravity and the metric determinant in our back - reaction corrected spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the break down of our calculation at the stretched horizon will be apparent in these quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface gravity is the force which would need to be exerted at infinity in order to keep an observer stationary at the event horizon : @xmath61={a'\\over 2}\\left ( { b\\over a}\\right ) ^{1/2}|_{r = r_h } \\ ; .\\ ] ] the surface gravity is then @xmath62}\\ ; , \\ ] ] which diverges at @xmath22 since the exponential is singular at @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , we find that @xmath63 diverges as @xmath64 as @xmath65 tends to zero . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a naive application of our results indicates that the metric is degenerate at the the stretched horizon since @xmath66 both the degeneracy of the corrected metric and the infinite surface gravity at the stretched horizon are a result of our perturbative calculation failing in that region and tell us nothing about the true situation near the unperturbed event horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> the breakdown in our calculation might be taken as support for the viewpoint@xcite that quantum gravity effects need to be included to obtain sensible results near the event hozion . </S>",
    "<S> a more conservative conclusion would be that the complete , time - dependent back - reaction calculation should be performed . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent approach could properly include hawking radiation as well as have a sensible perturbative treatment . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the unruh vacuum , @xmath67 is finite since the divergence in the static vacuum polarization is precisely canceled by the contribution from the outgoing flux of hawking radiation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> what we can say for certain is that we found no evidence that vacuum polarization gives rise to a short - distance cut - off . </S>"
