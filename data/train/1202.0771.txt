    "the formation of rocky earth - like planets , and the rock - ice cores of gas giant planets , are believed to involve assembly from a population of planetesimals that may range in size from 1 to @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of planets , asteroids and kuiper - belt objects in our own solar system covering a wide - range in semimajor axes , in addition to the broad diversity in orbital properties of extrasolar planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and debris discs around main - sequence stars , indicates that planetesimals form at orbital distances ranging from a few tenths of an @xmath1 out to more than @xmath2 from the central star . while there remain many open questions about how planetesimals form within a protoplanetary disc , a number of plausible models and scenarios",
    "have been suggested that exhibit differing degrees of sensitivity to the physical conditions within the disc .",
    "classical models of planetesimal formation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) involve an incremental process which starts from micron - sized dust grains .",
    "these grains grow via mutual collisions and sticking and settle toward the midplane of the protoplanetary disc ( ppd ) . assuming a laminar nebula a few times heavier than the minimum required to form the solar system @xcite",
    ", @xcite predicts a growth time scale equivalent to a few @xmath3 at @xmath4 .",
    "the main obstacle to the incremental formation scenario is the rapid inward migration of growing boulders once they reach sizes around one metre .",
    "moreover , as demonstrated by , differential radial migration of a population of planetesimals of varying sizes can lead to high relative velocities implying collisional fragmentation .    in an attempt to avoid these difficulties ,",
    "alternative formation scenarios have been proposed , which try to jump this metre - sized barrier by involving mechanisms of rapid planetesimal formation .",
    "these alternative scenarios go back to the classic idea of @xcite , who proposed formation of planetesimals through gravitational instability in a dense layer of solids resulting from vertical settling of dust grains .",
    "alternative scenarios that invoke rapid planetesimal formation include the concentration of mm - sized chondrules in turbulent eddies followed by direct gravitational collapse @xcite , the streaming instability @xcite , and particle trapping in zonal flows @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated by , processes of this kind may ultimately lead to the rapid formation of bodies larger than ceres via gravitational collapse of local concentrations of metre - sized objects , where the planetesimal masses depend on the disc mass .",
    "owing to their size , the emergence of planetesimals marks the transition into the gravitationally - dominated stage of planet formation .",
    "runaway growth quickly leads to the formation of oligarchs @xcite , which subsequently grow into planetary embryos and cores via mutual collisions and accretion of smaller bodies @xcite . for this runaway growth to proceed efficiently ,",
    "the velocity dispersion within the planetesimal swarm must remain significantly smaller than the surface - escape velocity of the accreting cores .",
    "accounting only for self - stirring of the population , this is certainly expected in a fully laminar protostellar nebula .",
    "however , the explanation of the typical accretion rates of t  tauri stars requires an anomalous source of viscous redistribution of angular momentum , most likely explained by disc turbulence .",
    "this poses the question whether or not runaway growth remains a realistic proposition in a turbulent protoplanetary disc .",
    "planetesimals and protoplanetary embryos embedded in turbulent ppds are subject to stochastic gravitational forces caused by density waves driven by the turbulent maxwell stresses acting within the disc @xcite .",
    "this issue was addressed in our previous work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter  paper  i  ) , where we compared global and local magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of protoplanetary discs involving turbulence driven by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",
    "following the evolution of swarms of embedded test particles , we studied the effects of magnetic turbulence on the dispersion of planetesimal semimajor axes and the growth of their internal velocity dispersion . in agreement with an earlier study",
    ", we found that fully - developed disc turbulence at a level consistent with observational constraints ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) would cause large - scale diffusion of planetesimals over distances of several @xmath5 ( in contradiction of solar system constraints ) and induce their collisional destruction .",
    "however , as originally contemplated by @xcite , sustaining magnetic fields within the protosolar nebula requires the gas to be sufficiently ionised .",
    "this was later pointed out in the context of magnetised disc turbulence by @xcite . in the wake of its discovery in the context of accretion discs , the linear development of the mri",
    "was studied in detail for the case of ion - neutral drift @xcite , and ohmic diffusion @xcite .",
    "the requirements for non - linear turbulence to be sustained have been studied by means of direct simulations for the case of ohmic resistivity @xcite , and ambipolar diffusion @xcite . because of the stabilising effect of epicyclic oscillations , a purely hydrodynamic flow is expected to be stable via the rayleigh criterion @xcite . lacking a plausible source for a sufficient number of free electrons , the flow is likely to remain in a laminar state .",
    "protoplanetary discs in the t  tauri stage are cold and dense , leading to the above mentioned low levels of ionisation @xcite . based on the fact that the dominant ionisation sources are likely external to the disc itself , @xcite proposed a layered model for partially ionised accretion discs : while the disc surface layers are well ionised by stellar x - rays , and sustain a turbulent accretion flow caused by the mri , the shielded disc interior is expected to harbour a ` dead zone ' where the flow remains laminar implying negligible levels of accretion .",
    "such layered discs were first investigated numerically by @xcite , who included a magnetic diffusivity varying with height .",
    "their box simulations demonstrated that the flow within the dead zone - region maintains a modest reynolds stress due to waves being excited by the active layers .",
    "owing to the high gas density in the bulk of the disc and the embedded sub - micron dust grains , a number of physical effects may significantly affect the overall ionisation balance .",
    "this holds true for both ppds in general , and the protosolar nebula in particular @xcite .",
    "the effect of dust on charge carriers was first investigated by @xcite . in a series of papers , studied the effect of small dust grains and different chemical reaction networks , and the role of turbulent mixing .",
    "an additional complication arises when one considers the hall term in ohm s law @xcite , introducing a dichotomy with respect to the mutual orientation of any vertical magnetic flux and the rotation axis @xcite .",
    "a study of the effect of the hall term on the mri turbulence saturation amplitude by @xcite found it to be little changed for the range of hall parameters they investigated .",
    "studies of the effects of ohmic dissipation determined by time - dependent reaction networks coupled to the mhd evolution have been presented by @xcite and .",
    "these works have shown that enlivening the dead zone via turbulent mixing of charge carriers is only efficient in the absence of small dust grains . however ,",
    "if a significant population of micron sized grains is present , the adsorption time scale of free electrons is short enough to maintain the dead zone @xcite .",
    "@xcite have suggested that fast moving electrons generated in magnetic reconnection events may provide a source of ionisation that can remove or modify the dead zone , but detailed calculations demonstrating the feasibility of this idea have yet to be done .",
    "building on this line of work , we have extended our study from paper  i to the case of stratified ppds .",
    "this includes a fiducial model being fully mri active , and two models including a magnetically inactive midplane region ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter  paper  ii  ) .",
    "the key results of this study were that the stirring of the planetesimals velocity dispersion was much reduced in the dead zone , as was their radial diffusion  satisfying the observational constraint that radial mixing of asteroids has probably not occurred over distances @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this possibly allows for the continued growth of planetesimals rather than destruction or erosion during collisions , and it was suggested that dead zones may provide safe havens for planetesimals .",
    "one perceived limitation of paper  ii was that we restricted ourselves to the case of a minimum mass protosolar nebula . while one would expect the strength of the stirring to scale approximately linearly with the disc mass ( all other things being equal ) , the relative level of density fluctuations might be affected by the extended width of the dead zone .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper , to elucidate on the net effect of these two counteracting dependencies , and moreover to examine the influence of varying the imposed magnetic field strength .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : the physical model and numerical methods are briefly recapitulated in section  [ sec : methods ] ; for a more thorough description , we refer the reader to paper  ii .",
    "simulation results are presented in three parts : in section  [ sec : disc_mass ] we study the dependence on the disc mass / column density , and in section  [ sec : net_flux ] , we show results on the variation with the external magnetic field permeating the disc vertically . a modified scaling relation to encompass all the obtained results",
    "is then developed in section  [ sec : drho_trq ] .",
    "implications for the scope and applicability of our results for planet formation theory are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper are based on our fiducial dead zone model d1 discussed in paper  ii .",
    "we again solve the standard equations of resistive mhd in a locally corotating , cartesian coordinate frame ( @xmath7 ) , adopting the shearing box formalism ( see * ? ? ? * and eqns . in sect .  2 of paper  ii )",
    "embedded in the dynamically evolving plasma are swarms of 25 non - interacting massive test particles , which are affected by disc gravity and the inertial forces in the local frame of reference .",
    "all simulations utilise the nirvana - iiicode @xcite ; further modifications to the solver are documented in sect .",
    "2.4 of paper  ii .",
    "the base state of our model is given by isothermal stratification in a fixed gravitational potential @xmath8 .",
    "unlike in earlier studies @xcite , and to allow for sufficiently wide mri - active regions , model d1 used a box size of @xmath9 scale heights , @xmath10 , on each side of the disc midplane . , the equilibrium density profile is proportional to @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath10 is identical to the ` @xmath12 ' in @xcite . ] based on our previous analysis of the influence of box size on gravitational stirring ( paper  i ) , we furthermore maintain a horizontal box size of @xmath13 , permitting the excitation of spiral density ( sd ) waves @xcite .",

    "the fiducial model d1.1 is identical to d1 and serves as a control for the changes described in sect .",
    "[ sec : ind ] below.[tab : models ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      a primary aim of this work is to construct discs of varying mass in which the active zone remains essentially unchanged in its mass and level of turbulence in each model , with the only change being in the mass and vertical thickness of the dead zone .",
    "this component of our study then becomes one in which we examine the effect of varying the mass of the dead zone keeping all other parameters fixed ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : params ] for reference ) .",
    "the numerical set - up we adopt for the models of varying disc mass is designed to achieve this aim .",
    "the initial magnetic field is a superposition of two components , a standard zero - net - flux ( znf ) configuration @xmath14 , and a weak additional vertical net - flux ( nvf ) component representing an external or dynamo - generated field .",
    "we vary the strength of the initial znf flux to produce a plasma parameter ( i.e. the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure ) @xmath15 independent of the midplane density ( and hence pressure ) of the three studied models .",
    "in contrast , we keep the absolute strength of the external net vertical flux ( which is conserved during the simulations ) fixed at a value corresponding to @xmath16 in physical units , resulting in a weaker relative field in the midplane of models with higher mass loading .",
    "note that the nvf component leads to a plasma parameter varying with height . as a consequence , the region of intermediate field strength , i.e. the vertical range , where the most unstable nonaxisymmetric mri modes fit into the box , moves up in the disc .",
    "we expect the resulting active regions to be of similar vertical extent irrespective of the mass loading , but separated by a wider dead zone in the case of heavier discs as is illustrated by shaded areas in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppd_strat ] . to maintain near - identical active zones across all runs , we adjust the vertical box size accordingly ( cf . tab .  [",
    "tab : models ] ) .",
    "the simulations that examine the influence of varying the strength of the net vertical magnetic field strength ( models d1-nvfa and d1-nvfb ) are initiated with specific values of the magnetic field ( @xmath17 and @xmath16 , respectively ) , and after every 40 orbits the field strength is incremented by factors of two up to some maximum value .",
    "although we only adopt two run labels for these simulations , these simulations in fact explore the influence of six different external magnetic field strengths ranging between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    as discussed in more detail in paper  ii , for the fluid variables",
    ", we use vertical boundary conditions allowing material to leave the box but prevent inflow . mass loss associated with the outflow boundaries",
    "is compensated by continually re - instating the initial density profile in each grid cell by means of an artificial mass source term . because of the low density in the halo , the relative change in the disc mass due to outflow is very low ( on the order of @xmath20 per orbit ) .",
    "we have verified that the additional term does not affect the obtained stirring amplitudes . as in our previous work ,",
    "we compute a locally and temporally varying magnetic diffusivity @xmath21 .",
    "this adds to the level of realism achieved in earlier simulations of dead zones by @xcite and @xcite , who used static diffusivity profiles .",
    "here we briefly re - capitulate the physical ionisation model we implement and refer the reader to section  2.3 of paper  ii for a more detailed discussion .",
    "because of the expected dominance of small dust grains , we decide to avoid following the detailed non - equilibrium chemistry and adopt a simplified approach for the gas - phase reactions . assuming that recombination happens much faster than any dynamical mixing timescale in our system , we update @xmath22 according to a precomputed table derived from the reaction network in ` model4 ` of . when computing the resistivity , we include the contributions of all the charged species following , eqns .",
    "( 21)-(31 ) . for the free parameters",
    ", we assume the same values described in paper  ii , i.e. dust grains of size @xmath23 and with density @xmath24 and a dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath25 ( such that we tacitly assume that 90 percent of the solid grains have already grown to become larger bodies ) .",
    "the gas - phase abundance of magnesium is taken to be depleted by a factor @xmath20 compared to its solar value ( with the remainder assumed to be bound - up in grains ) .",
    "the key factor governing the diffusivity @xmath22 , is the local ionisation rate @xmath26 , which is computed from the external irradiation by evaluating column densities to both the upper and lower disc surfaces . because of",
    "the expected radial density features , related to the excited spiral waves , this is done on a per - grid - cell basis .",
    "the ionisation model is founded on the work of @xcite , who studied how stellar x - rays , radionuclides , and energetic protons can influence the shape and extent of a possible dead zone via their effect on ohmic diffusion . implementing the model of @xcite ,",
    "we focus on stellar x - rays ( xr ) , and interstellar cosmic rays ( crs ) as the prime sources of ionisation . as a representative value",

    "we further include an ambient ionisation due to the decay of short - lived radionuclides ( sr ) .",
    "as already done for model d1 , and to somewhat limit the dynamic range in @xmath22 , the related ionisation is chosen @xmath34 the nominal value of @xmath35 quoted in @xcite .",
    "when simulating protoplanetary discs with dead zones using the shearing box approximation , there are two issues that arise which must be addressed to increase the feasibility and realism of the models .",
    "the first occurs because we are solving an advection - diffusion equation in time - explicit fashion .",
    "the time step size is restricted by the time for diffusion across one grid cell , and because this quantity scales with the square of the grid spacing , the presence of large diffusion coefficients can render the computational effort prohibitive in highly resolved runs .",
    "this was addressed in our previous paper by limiting the dynamic range in @xmath22 and applying the technique of temporal sub - cycling to the diffusive part of the induction equation ( cf .",
    "2.3.2 in paper  ii ) . with the more extended dead zones of models d1.2 and d1.4 , the time scales become even more disparate , and we have developed a modified scheme to deal with this , described in detail in appendix  [ sec : ind_mod ] .",
    "the second issue relates to the generation of strong azimuthal magnetic fields through the winding up of net radial fields in the box .",
    "although our simulations begin with zero net radial magnetic field in the computational domain , advection of horizontal field components through the open vertical boundary leads to the generation of net radial fields that may diffuse into the dead zone .",
    "once there , keplerian shear may wind them up to generate strong azimuthal fields that subsequently leak back into the active regions , modifying the turbulence there .",
    "this issue has been discussed by @xcite , where it was noted that the winding of fields generates a strong radial gradient in the azimuthal field strength due to the keplerian rotation profile in global discs , leading to radial diffusion of the strong fields that limits their growth .",
    "this radial diffusion can not occur in a shearing box due to the uniform shear and periodic boundary conditions ( but has been observed in the global simulations presented by ) , so we have developed an approximate scheme designed to crudely mimic the radial diffusion of fields in global discs .",
    "we refer to this scheme as super - box scale diffusion , and we describe its implementation in appendix  [ sec : ind_mod ] .",
    "in paper  ii , we restricted our analysis to the fiducial case of a minimum mass protosolar nebula , and this naturally begs the question how the results will be affected if one looks at more massive discs",
    ". a major aim of this study is to compute disc models with different masses / surface densities that have very similar active layers in terms of mass and turbulent activity .",
    "the main difference between the models will then be the physical depth and mass of the dead zone .",
    "density waves that are excited in the active layer will propagate into the dead zone and induce gravitational stirring of the planetesimals there through the density fluctuations that they generate .",
    "a key question is how this stirring depends on disc mass .",
    "based on the results of simulations presented in paper ii , we expect the disc models described below to have the following midplane - symmetric three - layer structure : a non - turbulent dead zone located at and above the midplane in which the mri is quenched by ohmic resistivity , on top of which lies a turbulent region in which the mri operates unaffected by resistivity . at disc altitudes above the mri - active region",
    "lies a magnetically dominated halo in which the field strength is too large for the mri to operate because unstable modes do not fit within the available vertical extent .",
    "density waves excited at the interface between the dead zone and mri - active layer will propagate into the dead zone , creating density fluctuations at the midplane .",
    "we denote the density at the active / dead zone interface as @xmath36 .",
    "the disc models of different mass we compute are designed to generate discs in which very similar active layers lie above and below dead zones of different mass , and for which the midplane density , @xmath37 , scales with the disc mass .",
    "we expect each of our models therefore to have very similar values of the density , @xmath38 , and perturbed velocity , @xmath39 , at the dead / active zone interface .",
    "linear density waves that travel sonically into the dead zone should conserve energy as they propagate , such that we expect @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the perturbed velocity at the midplane .",
    "relative density fluctuations for isothermal sound waves satisfy the relation @xmath42 such that relative density fluctuations at the disc midplane should obey the scaling @xmath43 translated into absolute density fluctuations , this implies a scaling @xmath44 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the fluctuating torque , @xmath45 , induced by density fluctuations near the midplane will scale linearly with @xmath46 , leading to the naive expectation that stochastic torques will scale according to @xmath47 .    at the time of writing an extensive study of mri turbulence in layered accretion discs appeared in print @xcite . for a broader discussion about scaling relations in disc models with dead zones",
    "we refer the reader to this recent publication .      as in sect .",
    "3.2 of paper  ii , we will start our discussion by looking at the evolution of the gas disc as shown in figure  [ fig : spctm ] . owing to the additional magnetic diffusion term ( cf .",
    "[ sec : super_box ] ) , the overall evolution of model d1.1 ( left hand panels ) appears somewhat less intermittent than the identical setup from model d1 in paper  ii .",
    "this is also true for the heavier models d1.2 ( centre ) and d1.4 ( right hand panels ) .",
    "the different models in fact appear very similar , e.g. , in terms of the cycle frequency of the field reversals and the overall field amplitude .",
    "also the stresses and relative density fluctuations within the mri - active regions are nearly identical .",
    "the only apparent trend is seen in the relative density fluctuations in the midplane region , which fall off with mass loading .",
    "the relative amplitudes , as listed in column 7 of tab .",
    "[ tab : sim_results ] , are 0.091 , 0.058 , and 0.038 , respectively , which implies a scaling with the midplane density to the power of @xmath48 ; this is in decent agreement with the expected scaling @xmath49 discussed above in sect .",
    "[ sec : linear_waves ] .",
    "the discrepancy can partly be ascribed to the varying @xmath50 at the layer interface ( cf .",
    "[ sec : disc_struct ] below ) , which shows a slight trend  with a power @xmath51  towards weaker absolute fluctuations in heavier discs .",
    "overall , the results indicate that the propagation of density waves from the transition region between the active and dead zones occurs without significant dissipation of energy .    because our model assumes that the main source of ionisation is exterior to the disc surface , the width of the dead zone depends on the column density of the shielding material .",
    "the extent of the dead zone as a function of various ionisation sources was studied in detail by @xcite . in our simulations , we determine the transition region via the criterion that the elsasser serves as a robust indicator for suppression of the fastest - growing mri mode ( see * ? ? ?",
    "] number @xmath52 equals unity ( indicated by a solid black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spctm ] ) .",
    "this yields a time - averaged half thickness of 1.66@xmath530.04 , 2.02@xmath530.03 , and 2.33@xmath530.03@xmath54 for models d1.1 - 4 , respectively .",
    "in other words , doubling the disc mass increases the extent of the dead zone by a third of a pressure scale height @xmath10 . as can be seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : spctm ] , the extent of the different layers is remarkably stationary . as a result ,",
    "the dead zone thickness only fluctuates on the per - cent level .",
    "this has , of course , to be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "external conditions ( e.g. , gas inflow from the parent molecular cloud , stellar x - ray luminosity , intensity of arriving crs , @xmath55 ) in a realistic protoplanetary disc are likely to vary strongly both in time and space",
    ". however , the relative quiescence of our experimental setup will allow us to quantify the secular evolution of the embedded planetesimals more accurately .",
    "the peaks in the stress sits just outside the transition region between the active and inactive layers ( shaded).[fig : reyn_z ] ]     is seen .",
    "the peaks in the stress sits just outside the transition region between the active and inactive layers ( shaded).[fig : reyn_z ] ]    having assured ourselves of the stationary nature of the flow , we can now proceed and look at the characteristic structure of the layered disc . in figure  [ fig : maxw_z ] , we plot the time - averaged ( 20 - 220 orbits ) maxwell stress @xmath56 for the three models d1.1 - 4 , of varying column density . as discussed in the last section ,",
    "owing to the random diffusion of flux into the midplane region , there is no systematic to the residual level within the dead zone .",
    "as noted earlier , we expect the mri - active zone to move away from the midplane for the higher density models , and this trend is clearly seen . as a result",
    ", we infer very similar vertically - integrated mass accretion rates of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for runs d1.1 - 4 , respectively .",
    "this is in - line with the volume - averaged values stated in column 4 of tab .",
    "[ tab : sim_results ] and demonstrates that higher mass loading does not affect the level of activity or mass in the active zone , but merely the vertical extent and mass of the dead zone , such that the nonlinear evolution of the disc models arising from the specified initial conditions is as intended .",

    "the reynolds stresses scale with the gas density but this trend is very weak at their respective peak position , which lies just outside the layer interface .",
    "this region is of particular interest as it marks the position in the disc where the turbulent fluctuations created by the mri - active layers are most energetic in terms of their mass loading and hence their associated momenta .",
    "tracing the interface via the @xmath64 criterion , we obtain very similar _ absolute _ density fluctuations at this line .",
    "the respective values are @xmath65 0.045 , 0.043 , and 0.042 for models",
    "d1.1 - 4    we conclude that , in all three models , the dead zone sees a very similar boundary separating it from the active zone , with the only difference being in its physical separation from the particle swarm located near @xmath66 . in the following section",
    ", we will determine the consequences this has on the gravitational forcing exerted onto the planetesimals , and examine if the stochastic torques follow the scaling predicted in sect .",
    "[ sec : linear_waves ] .",
    "it was established in the global simulations of @xcite and that density fluctuations from developed turbulence lead to stochastic gravitational forces which can have a significant impact on the dynamical evolution of embedded planetesimals and protoplanets .",
    "we remark that earlier shearing box simulations of mhd turbulence have shown the development of axisymmetric pressure bumps or ` zonal flows ' @xcite , which may influence the stirring of planetesimals .",
    "analysis of our simulation d1.1 suggests that the midplane density supports a long - lived ( 20 - 30 orbits ) , axisymmetric density asymmetry across the radial width of the box with amplitude @xmath67% .",
    "this may be an indication that weak zonal flows arise even in the presence of a dead zone .",
    "the role of this in stirring planetesimals is unclear at present and will the subject of a future study .    in our previous papers , we have quantified the level of stirring for a range of disc models .",
    "we here perform a similar analysis and find broad agreement with previous runs . in particular , model d1.1 agrees well with the earlier run d1 from paper  ii  we attribute the discrepancy of about ten per - cent in the torques between d1 ( 0.06 ) and d1.1 ( 0.054 ) to the lower level of sampling noise achieved in the new set of simulations , where a more conservative choice for the gravitational softening parameter was taken .",
    "we note that when statistically correcting the original results from d1 for a weak systematic dependence on the particle position on the grid , excellent agreement can be obtained .       for the models d1.1 - 4 with varying disc mass .",
    "residuals indicate the deviation from a normal distribution . ]",
    "torque time series , @xmath68 , are derived from the gravitational forces acting on the particles along the @xmath69  direction within our simulation box , and are recorded along the evolving trajectory of the particles .",
    "torque amplitudes , @xmath70 , for the different runs are obtained from a gaussian fit to the histograms as depicted in figure  [ fig : trq_his ] .",
    "averaging over the swarm of 25 particles and sub - intervals in time allows us to estimate error bars , and we infer values of @xmath71 0.054@xmath530.004 for model d1.1 , and 0.052@xmath530.003 for both models d1.2 and d1.4 ( these values are also listed for reference in column eight of table  [ tab : sim_results ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the width of the torque distribution is remarkably insensitive to the column density , and models d1.1 through d1.4 agree to within five per - cent , which is somewhat smaller than the error bars .",
    "this result is in clear conflict with the simple scaling law based on conservation of wave energy for isothermal sounds waves ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : linear_waves ] ) .",
    "naive expectations suggest that fluctuating torques experienced by solid bodies located near the disc midplane will scale linearly with absolute density fluctuations there , where we both predict and observe the scaling @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we expect the fluctuating torque amplitude to scale with the square - root of the disc mass in these simulations . as discussed in sect .  [",
    "sec : disc_struct ] , we find that all models agree on the relative density fluctuations at the transition between the dead and active zone , and the absolute and relative density fluctuations at the midplane are in good agreement with the scaling arguments ( also cf .",

    "this suggests that a more subtle effect is responsible for modifying the expected linear scaling between the midplane density fluctuations , @xmath46 , and the rms torque fluctuations , @xmath70 , shown in figure  [ fig : trq_his ] .",

    "the modulation is even more pronounced in model d1.4 , which moreover shows a significantly reduced coherence time of @xmath78 .",

    "increasing the disc mass by a factor of two or four above the nominal value for the minimum - mass model leads to the unexpected result that the strength of particle stirring is independent of disc mass .",
    "scaling relations based on a simple picture of linear waves being excited in the active layer and propagating into the dead zone predict that absolute density fluctuations at the midplane will scale with the square - root of the column density .",
    "this scaling is observed in the simulations , but gravitational stirring is found to be insensitive to the larger absolute density fluctuations .",
    "analysis of two - point correlation functions for the midplane density fields between discs with different dead zone heights show that typical density structures in discs with larger dead zones are more elongated in the azimuthal direction .",
    "density waves propagating from the active layer into the dead zone are more sheared out when they reach the midplane in larger dead zones , resulting in reduced stochastic gravitational forces .",
    "we suggest this phenomenon explains the insensitivity of planetesimal stirring to increasing disc mass , as is demonstrated by a scaling - law for the stochastic torques that depends on the dead zone vertical extent , and which accounts reasonably for our simulation results .",
    "4 .   decrementing the external magnetic field strength increases the size of the dead zone and decreases the level of activity in the turbulent layers .",
    "this , in turn , leads to reduced absolute density fluctuations in the disc midplane and corresponding reductions in the level of gravitational stirring experienced by embedded planetesimals .",
    "moderate increments in the external magnetic field strength reduce the size of the dead zone , and increase the level of activity in the turbulent layers .",
    "this , at first , results in an increased stirring of planetesimals , but quenching occurs when the position of the dead zone interface reaches saturation .",
    "this is because the amount to which the active layers can constrict the dead zone is limited ( via the @xmath64 criterion ) by the steep rise in @xmath239 . for our model ,",
    "torque fluctuations saturate for @xmath240 , while turbulent stresses grow up to net fields of @xmath241 , where the mri eventually shuts off .",
    "a disc hosting a modest external field ( of @xmath242 ) leads to equilibrium velocity dispersions for @xmath229 to @xmath218 planetesimals below the catastrophic disruption threshold for even the weakest aggregates .",
    "this demonstrates that reasonable disc models can be constructed in which the dead zone provides a safe - haven for weak planetesimals against collisional destruction .",
    "there remain a number of caveats that we have not yet addressed , and which may modify the detailed conclusions drawn in this paper .",
    "these include adoption of a simple equation of state for the disc , and a mono - disperse size distribution for planetesimals when estimating collisional damping rates .",

    ", we were not able to evaluate gravitational torques for the higher - resolved run but have to rely on the hydrodynamic quantities as proxies instead .",
    "the dependence of key quantities defining the turbulent state of the fluid are shown in figure  [ fig : resol ] .    as was briefly discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : turb_nvf ] , the numerical requirements for resolving the development of the mri in the presence of a net vertical field are safely established by linear theory .",
    "accordingly , we see very little change in the turbulent stresses @xmath243 , and @xmath244 when increasing the numerical resolution beyond the basic requirement .",
    "however , from our study of the box - size dependence in paper  i , we recall that convergence in these quantities does not necessarily guarantee that secondary effects are equally well resolved .",
    "in particular , this applied to the convergence ( with box size ) in the amplitude @xmath103 of the excited of spiral density waves .",
    "because of the predicted non - linear steepening of the analytic wave profile @xcite , we suspect that spurious numerical dissipation might have an influence on the lifetime of wave fronts and hence on the overall amplitude of density perturbations .",
    "this effect is seen in the dependence of @xmath103 on the numerical resolution as shown by the upper line in figure  [ fig : resol ]",
    ". there @xmath103 changes by almost 70% when increasing the number of points from 16 to 24 per @xmath10 , i.e. , for a 50% increase in linear resolution .",
    "in contrast , when going from 24 to 32 cells ( corresponding to an additional 33% increase in resolution ) , the change in @xmath103 remains below 15% , such that the discrepancy between the two resolutions is consistent within the error bars .",
    "put into proportion with the level of accuracy aimed for , this indicates that our standard resolution of @xmath245 is reasonably converged and will allow to predict turbulent density fluctuations to within about @xmath246 .",
    "let us first focus on the time step limitations imposed by the high value of the diffusivity coefficient @xmath22 near the disc midplane ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : ppd_strat ] ) . given",
    "the need to evolve the simulations over several hundred dynamical time scales to follow the evolution of the embedded planetesimals , using these profiles is prohibitive . by inspecting earlier simulations and test runs ,",
    "however , we have determined that there exists no significant small - scale structure in the regions of high diffusivity .",
    "this is hardly surprising as the diffusion term is very efficient at removing features in the magnetic field topology .",
    "we have found that imposing a cap to the diffusivity , @xmath22 , corresponding to a value of @xmath247 , does not significantly change the observed field topology , while at the same time permitting a much larger computational time step .",
    "however , as we will see below , additional care has to be taken to make this approach viable .",
    "owing to the periodic nature of the shearing box approximation , the only field structures that remain in the dead zone region are vertical variations in the radial and azimuthal field .",
    "magnetic fields are essentially uniform in the horizontal directions .",
    "the vertical variations are given by the horizontally - averaged mean values @xmath248 , and @xmath249 .",
    "let us now examine how these are affected by diffusion .",
    "note that the induction equation @xmath250 is linear in both @xmath251 , and @xmath22 , and can be decomposed accordingly . for reasons that will become obvious in a moment , we split the induction equation into two parts , reflecting the evolution of the horizontally averaged mean fields and their fluctuations ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because the geometric averaging operation trivially commutes with the differential operators in ( [ eq : ind ] )",
    ", this decomposition is exact .",
    "focusing on the evolution of the mean fields , we now write down the diffusive part of the related induction equation : @xmath252\\,,\\qquad     i \\in \\left\\ { x , y \\right\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : mean}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing a cap on the value of @xmath22 ( and hence removing its @xmath136-dependence beyond a certain depth within the dead zone ) may significantly alter the character of ( [ eq : mean ] ) , and we illustrate this by means of a simple example : note that for constant @xmath22 , a field varying linearly with @xmath136 is not subject to any further diffusion as @xmath253 in this case .",
    "in contrast , any `` bump '' in @xmath22 will make @xmath254 vary in @xmath136 even if @xmath255 is constant .",
    "the diffusion term will then act to flatten a given linear ramp , removing any residual gradients in @xmath256 .",
    "looking at the strong gradients @xmath257 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppd_strat ] , this implies a potentially efficient means to redistribute field .",
    "ultimately , a weak gradient in @xmath258 can lead to strong diffusion in the presence of a large gradient in @xmath22 .    because it is a one - dimensional equation , the overhead of solving ( [ eq : mean ] ) is computationally inexpensive , even under stringent time step constraints .",
    "consequently , we split ( [ eq : ind ] ) into four parts by separating both @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "here subscripts refer to the resulting magnetic reynolds number , @xmath261 , as indicated by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppd_strat ] ; also note the function arguments indicating that the highly diffusive low-@xmath261 part of @xmath22 , ( i.e. @xmath262 ) is only applied to the mean - field equation . in summary , this approach allows us to retain the full @xmath22  profile in ( [ eq : mean ] ) , while using the capped @xmath22  profile in the expensive three - dimensional equation .",
    "we finally remark that retaining the full @xmath22 in the mean fields will likely enhance the leakage of field into the dead zone , as discussed above .",
    "neglect of the large - scale radial structure makes the shearing - box a poor set - up for global magnetic field evolution .",
    "this deficiency becomes most apparent within the dead zone , as we have discussed briefly above .",
    "accounting for the global disc topology , @xcite derived a criterion for the evolution of large - scale magnetic fields within dead zones .",
    "owing to the limitations imposed by the neglect of curvature terms , shearing boxes can not reproduce the related threshold , which applies in global cylindrical coordinates .",
    "this is because the divergence of radial field lines is not included , so @xmath263 can be uniform where @xmath264 would decline as @xmath265 . omitting radial gradients in @xmath264",
    "contributes to the uniform shear - generated @xmath266 and the weak resistive diffusion .",
    "moreover , in a global disc model , the keplerian rotation profile @xmath267 leads to a radial variation of the shearing time scale .",
    "in contrast , a single orbital frequency @xmath268 applies throughout the local box , such that a uniform radial field stretches out into a uniform toroidal field . with the toroidal field uniform ,",
    "the resistive term @xmath269 in the induction equation toroidal component is zero , preventing the diffusion of the shear - generated fields . as a result",
    ", local simulations of dead zones can exhibit the growth of large toroidal flux ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may spuriously feed - back into the mri - active regions .    one possibility to account for the global field evolution would be to remove toroidal flux at a rate consistent with the solution of the global induction equation",
    "for example , if one assumed a power - law radial dependence for the dead zone toroidal field @xmath270 , and a radially uniform resistivity , the axisymmetric cylindrical induction equation has resistive term @xmath271 . because of the uncertainty related to the parameter @xmath193 , we chose an even simpler approach and estimate the time scale on which diffusion redistributes azimuthal flux as @xmath272 noting that a fourier mode of wave number @xmath273 would exponentially decay according to @xmath274 , we remove toroidal ( and radial ) flux via an additional source term @xmath275 in the one - dimensional part of the induction equation . as we will find when discussing the results",
    ", this choice of the global decay time scale retains some weak fields within the midplane ( also cf .",
    "fig .  3 in * ?",
    "* ) , indicating that we are not significantly over - damping the system .",
    "as can be seen in the upper panel of fig .  5 of paper  ii , model d1 is affected by relatively strong fields diffusing into the midplane region . to make the comparison with models d1.2 , and d1.4",
