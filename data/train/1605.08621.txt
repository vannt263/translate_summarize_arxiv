    "the remarkable relationship between virasoro singular vectors and jack polynomials @xcite turns out to have a surprising supersymmetric counterpart . indeed , there are two completely different formulations of this representation of the super - virasoro singular vectors in terms of symmetric polynomials .",
    "+ the first one @xcite relies on the extension of the jack polynomials to superpolynomials , which are polynomials that depend upon additional anticommuting variables . in this context , the simple link which exists in the virasoro case , namely that a singular vector is represented by a single jack indexed by a rectangular partition , becomes somewhat more complicated .",
    "indeed , instead of a single jack superpolynomial ( sjack for short ) indexed by a superpartition of rectangular form , a singular vector is represented by a linear combination of sjacks indexed by the so - called self - complementary superpartitions which are controlled by the expected rectangle .",
    "a self - complementary superpartition is such that when glued in a specific manner with ( a slightly modified version of ) itself , it fills the defining rectangle .",
    "the explicit expression for the coefficients of these linear combinations has been conjectured ( and heavily tested ) in both the neveu - schwarz ( ns ) and ramond ( r ) sectors@xcite .",
    "+ the second one @xcite , proposed almost simultaneously , bypasses the manipulation of fermionic variables by bosonising the free fermion modes in an intricate way .",
    "then the symmetric polynomial representing the singular vector is a uglov polynomial indexed by a rectangular partition , exactly as in the virasoro case .",
    "the uglov polynomials , like the jacks , can be obtained from the macdonald polynomials , which depend upon two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , in a special limit .",
    "while the jack case is recovered by taking @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the uglov case corresponds to @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  10 ) ) .",
    "this connection , conjectured in @xcite , has recently been proved in @xcite .",
    "notice however that this second construction is limited to the ns sector . + in the present work ,",
    "we reconsider the first approach along the lines of the argument of @xcite which is sketched in the following subsection .      the derivation of the relationship virasoro - jack proceeds via the following steps .    1 .   using the free boson representation of the virasoro algebra , write the singular vector at grade @xmath9 in terms of a composite screening charge as |_r , s = dz f(z,_- ) |_r , swhere @xmath10 is a polynomial in the free boson negative modes ( @xmath11 is the subalgebra of the negative modes of the heisenberg algebra , see ) and in the @xmath12 variables .",
    "this function comes from the normally ordered product of @xmath13 vertex operators together with the prefactor generated by this ordering .",
    "the vector @xmath14 is a suitable fock highest - weight state specified by two positive integers @xmath13 and @xmath15 , such that the resulting expression @xmath16 is a well - defined ( nontrivial ) singular vector .",
    "identify , within @xmath10 , a jack polynomial evaluated at @xmath17 , so that f(z,_-)=p^()_(s^r)(z^-1 ) r(z,_- ) where @xmath18 is the rectangular partition whose diagram has @xmath13 rows all of length @xmath15 and @xmath19 is a free parameter  free because this jack actually does not depend upon @xmath19 , being equal to a single monomial .",
    "this is so because the number of variables is equal to the number of parts in @xmath18 and because @xmath18 is the lowest partition ( with respect to the dominance ordering ) of degree @xmath9 having this property .",
    "the term @xmath20 contains a factor @xmath21 which is precisely the weight function defining the scalar product for the jacks with a particular parameter @xmath22 : p^()_,p^()_dz w(z ; ) p^()_(z^-1 ) p_^()(z).this suggests trying to write the integral over @xmath23 in terms of a scalar product for which , by setting @xmath24 , we already have the left component , namely @xmath25 , and the weight @xmath21 .",
    "introduce an algebra isomorphism @xmath26 relating the operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 , of @xmath11 to symmetric polynomials : ( p_m)= a_-mwhere @xmath29 is a constant to be fixed shortly and @xmath30 with the @xmath31 being new variables ( in unlimited number ) . under the inverse action of this isomorphism , @xmath20 gets transformed into @xmath32 .",
    "then observe that there is a particular value of @xmath29 , related to @xmath22 , for which @xmath32 can be decomposed as r(z , y)=w(z ; ) _",
    "p_^()(z)p_^()(y ) b _ ( ) for some constant @xmath33 .",
    "we have thus    5 .",
    "we next use the orthogonality property of the jacks , namely : dz w(z ; ) p^()_(z^-1 ) p_^()(z)_,to conclude that ( p_(s^r)^()(y ) ) |_r , sthe sought - for result .",

    ", s = dz d f(z , , ( h c)_- ) |_r , swhich is expressed in terms of the variables @xmath12 and a set of anticommuting variables @xmath34 .",
    "the function @xmath35 is the product of @xmath13 normally ordered super - vertex operators .",
    "the notation @xmath36 refers to the negative modes of the free boson and the free fermion ( @xmath37 stands for clifford algebra , which is sector - dependent , ns or r ) .",
    "the highest weight @xmath38 is the tensor product of suitable bosonic and fermionic highest - weight states .",
    "appealing to the theory of symmetric superpolynomials , we identify within the function @xmath35 a jack superpolynomial @xmath39 in the variables @xmath40 , i.e. , f(z , , ( h c)_-)= p_^()(z^-1 , _ ) b(z , ) w(z ; ) r(z , , ( h c)_- ) .",
    "the replacement of the variables @xmath41 by @xmath42 in a superpolynomial can be interpreted as the adjoint operation defined by the orthogonality relation of superpolynomials : p_^()(z^-1,_)=[p_^()(z,)]^. the label @xmath43 , called a superpartition , is a direct generalization of the rectangular partition @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we obtain a residual ( sector - dependent ) factor @xmath44 that is neither part of a sjack nor part of the weight function @xmath21 defining the sjack scalar product .",
    "the expression for @xmath44 can be transformed into an operator that acts on the jack superpolynomial , inside the orthogonality relation : p_^()(z^-1 , _ ) b(z , ) = [b^p_^()(z,)]^. @xmath45 is symmetric but it does not act diagonally on @xmath46 .",
    "therefore @xmath47 generates a linear combination of jack superpolynomials : b^p_^()(z,)= _ d _ , ( ) p_^()(z , ) .",
    "we then define an algebra isomorphism whose inverse maps the term @xmath48 into the power sum version of the cauchy formula which can be transformed into a bilinear sum of sjacks : r(z , , ( h c)_- ) _",
    "p_^()(z , ) p_^()(y , ) b _ ( ) .",
    "the singular vector becomes then |_r , s= _ b _ ( ) ( p_^()(y , ) ) dz d w(z ; ) [b^p_^()(z,)]^ p_^()(z,)|_r , s .",
    "finally , we use the orthogonality relation of the sjacks , dz d w(z ; )  [ p_^()(z,)]^ p_^()(z , ) _ , , to conclude that the singular vector is given by a linear combination of the terms that appear in @xmath47 but whose expansion coefficients are dressed by normalization factors @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "the resulting expression for the singular vector is thus of the form |_r , s=_d_,n_ ( p_^()(y,))|_r , snow , the factors @xmath49 are known .",
    "however , in general , the coefficients @xmath51 are not known .",
    "we thus end up an implicit , albeit general , expression for the singular vectors .",
    "how does this compare with the conjectured expressions in @xcite ? note first that these latter results are presented in a different sjack basis , that is , for a different value of the jack parameter , which explains the mismatch with the present results .",
    "in general , the expressions presented here are simpler in that they contain less terms .",
    "another advantage is that here they are derived , and therefore proved , as opposed to being conjectured .",
    "but in @xcite , there is an explicit conjecture for the expression of all the coefficients for any singular vector , which is not the case here .      in section  [ svirsvsc ] , we collect review material on the superconformal algebra , its free field representation and the definition of the screening charges from which the singular vectors are constructed . sections",
