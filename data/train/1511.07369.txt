    "quantum dots ( qds ) populated by electrons or holes are considered to be promising platforms for the physical realization of qubits for quantum computation.@xcite much progress both in theory and experiment was made in studying gaas - based qds.@xcite however , recently si or ge based qds attracted much attention .",
    "the reason is that in isotopically purified @xmath0si or isotopes of ge with nuclear spin @xmath1 ( e.g.  @xmath2ge ) decoherence sources characteristic to gaas are absent , namely hyperfine interaction and spin orbit interaction ( soi ) due to lattice - inversion asymmetry .",
    "known schemes for spin qubits in si or ge are based on , e.g. , donor electron spins,@xcite host@xcite and donor@xcite nuclear spins , nuclear - electron spin qubits ( si : bi),@xcite qubits based on si / sio@xmath3 structures,@xcite hole spin qubits in ge - si core - shell nanowires,@xcite and lateral qds within the 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) in si / sige heterostructures.@xcite the sixfold degeneracy of conduction band valleys in si can be an additional source of decoherence @xcite compared to gaas .",
    "however , four of the six valleys get split off by a large energy of the order of a hundred mev in sige / si / sige quantum wells because of the strain.@xcite due to confinement , which may also be varied via electric fields , the twofold degeneracy of the remaining valleys is lifted , and reported valley splittings are of the order of 0.11.@xcite for instance , electric control over the valley splitting for qds in si / sio@xmath3 was reported , and the presented energy range for the valley splitting is 0.30.8.@xcite therefore , it is possible to suppress the effect of many valleys in si if the energies characteristic for the qubit subspace are small enough .",
    "following the development in theory and experiment investigating the behavior of electron spin states in single and double quantum dots in si,@xcite we study a lateral double quantum dot ( dqd ) built in a si / sige heterostructure and occupied by two electrons .",
    "we consider the relaxation and decoherence of the two - electron spin states due to phonons .",
    "given the recent high interest in spin qubits at the @xmath4-@xmath5 anticrossing , @xcite where @xmath4 is a spin singlet and @xmath5 a spin triplet with magnetic quantum number @xmath6 , we investigate how the relaxation time @xmath7 and the decoherence time @xmath8 of such qubits depend on temperature for different kinds of hybridization of the singlet .",
    "we derive and analyze the dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath8 on the magnetic field gradient , which is usually applied in order to operate the spin qubits .",
    "@xcite we further study the effects of one - phonon and two - phonon processes and suggest the regimes where our theory can be tested experimentally .",

    "we consider lateral dqds in a si / sige heterostructure grown along the crystallographic direction [ 001 ] , which we also denote as @xmath11 .",
    "the confinement in the plane perpendicular to @xmath11 is generated by the gates .",
    "the homogeneous magnetic field @xmath12 is in this plane .",
    "an applied magnetic field gradient , which is usually produced via a micromagnet , enables control over the bloch sphere of the spin qubit even in the absence of hyperfine and spin orbit interactions .",

    "the hamiltonian is therefore of the same form as for the hyperfine interaction and reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 appears due to the magnetic field gradient between the qds , @xmath24 is the vector of spin 1/2 pauli matrices for the electron spin , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are projectors for the left and right qd , respectively.@xcite    now we consider the electron - phonon interaction in si .",

    "the sample volume @xmath54 will cancel out in the analysis .    in this section",

    "due to the strong confinement of the electrons in the growth direction , it turns out that the wave functions chosen along @xmath11 hardly affect the phonon - assisted relaxation and decoherence processes that we are interested in .",

    "we note that in experiments an electric field is usually applied along the growth direction of si / sige heterostructures , which changes the shape of the assumed quantum well potential from rectangular toward triangular .",
    "however , as the electrons are strongly confined along  @xmath11 , the details of the well hardly affect the qubit lifetimes and we find that our results do not change by more than @xmath7010% when the potential becomes completely triangular . as a consequence , our theory is also well applicable to , e.g. , lateral si dqds formed in si / sio@xmath3 systems .",
    "the hamiltonian in our basis reads    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the tunnel coupling , @xmath73 is the onsite repulsion , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the matrix elements of coulomb interaction , @xmath76 with @xmath77 as",

    "the schrieffer - wolff transformation is valid when the matrix elements resulting from electron - phonon coupling are much smaller than the energy difference between the qubit subspace and other states .",
    "after the schrieffer - wolff transformation , the qubit subspace is well separated from other states , which allows us to study the dynamics in terms of an effective hamiltonian of the form @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a 2@xmath1072 part that contains information about the qubit without phonons and @xmath108 is the interaction between qubit and phonons at time @xmath109 in the interaction representation .    defining the pseudo - spin vector @xmath110 as a vector of pauli matrices @xmath111 in the qubit subpace , where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 are the directions in the pseudo - spin space , we can represent @xmath106 and @xmath115 as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a positive energy and @xmath118 contains electron - phonon interaction matrix elements .",

    "in contrast , for the si dqds studied here , the obtained decay times for singlet - triplet qubits are relatively long , at least for many parameter regimes , and so it is well possible that the experimentally feasible qubit lifetimes will be limited by other mechanisms , some of which we briefly discuss below . nevertheless , even if other mechanisms turn out to dominate in standard regimes , we identified and proposed ways how our theory can be confirmed experimentally , which would be a desirable contribution to understanding and assessing the role of the discussed one- and two - phonon processes in these si - based systems .    among the most relevant noise sources for electrically controllable qubits",
    "is charge noise,@xcite which may be due to charge traps within the heterostructure or noise from the gates .",
    "for instance , electrical noise was considered as a major obstacle for the implementation of high - quality two - qubit gates between @xmath4-@xmath9 qubits in gaas.@xcite theoretical studies suggest that the effects of charge noise in gaas and si are similar to a great extent.@xcite as evident from , e.g. , the pure - dephasing model discussed in ref .",
    ", the resulting decay will depend both on the spectral density of the noisy fluctuations in the level splitting of the qubit and on the details of the operation scheme , as suitable pulse sequences for dynamical decoupling may strongly prolong the dephasing time.@xcite furthermore , decoherence due to charge noise can be much suppressed by operating the qubit at a sweet spot , where the level splitting of the qubit is insensitive to electric field fluctuations .",
    "this is a particularly advantageous feature of @xmath4-@xmath9 qubits in unbiased dqds@xcite and @xmath4-@xmath5 qubits ( especially those based on @xmath125-@xmath127 , see sec .",
    "[ subsec : tminus11s ] ) operated at the anticrossing.@xcite    while we considered here the bloch - redfield theory and studied the phonon - assisted relaxation and decoherence that results from one- and two - phonon processes , such as the two - phonon raman process,@xcite a spin - boson model was adopted in ref .   in order to describe pure dephasing of @xmath4-@xmath9 qubits in the absence of any real or virtual phonon absorption or emission . in the calculations of ref .",
    ", interactions between the electrons and a dissipative phonon reservoir lead to an exponential decay of the qubit coherence , and the associated dephasing time depends strongly on the overlap of the electron wave functions and the decay properties of the phonon bath .",
    "in contrast to our model , where the qubit lifetimes in gaas turned out to be limited by the piezoelectric electron - phonon coupling,@xcite the lifetimes calculated in ref .   for both si and gaas",
    "are limited by the deformation potential coupling .",
    "depending on the experimental setup this additional decay channel might dominate , particularly for strongly overlapping quantum dots in si , and it can be suppressed by moving the two dots farther apart.@xcite    as mentioned before in sec .",
    "[ subsec : smalldetuning ] , valley - related effects can become an important source of decoherence if the energy splitting between valleys is not sufficiently large.@xcite among other things , disorder or interface effects for si / sige and si / sio@xmath3 can play a significant role here.@xcite when the valley splitting is large , however , qubit decoherence due to the valley degrees of freedom is suppressed , and splittings of the order of 1  mev or even more are experimentally feasible.@xcite    finally , the coherence of qubits in si / sige heterostructures can be lost due to interaction with the nuclear spins , although the hyperfine - induced dephasing time of 360 ( no echo pulses ) reported for a si dqd @xcite is already one to two orders of magnitude longer than the typical values for gaas.@xcite ultimately , however , the hyperfine coupling will not present a limiting factor for the qubit lifetimes , since si and ge can be grown nuclear - spin - free .",
    "we considered @xmath4-@xmath5 qubits in the anticrossing region for the two cases where the singlet is mainly @xmath59 and where it is mainly @xmath56 . in the latter case , @xmath7 and @xmath8 turned out to be much longer than in the former one .",
    "we showed that the magnetic field gradient reduces @xmath7 and @xmath8 substantially , when it is above a certain value at which the one - phonon process starts to dominate over the two - phonon process .",
    "this follows from the fact that the magnetic field gradient provides the splitting in the anticrossing , and therefore the one - phonon process is very sensitive to its change . in contrast , two - phonon - based relaxation does not change noticeably in the range of parameters we use , and two - phonon - based dephasing is very weak even though it does depend on the magnetic field gradient .",
    "we proposed regimes where our theory of one- and two - phonon processes may be experimentally tested .",
    "remarkably , @xmath8 ( @xmath7 ) has a peak ( dip ) at the center of the @xmath4-@xmath5 anticrossing in the dependence on the applied magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b_dep_twoph ] ) . as the external magnetic field",
    "can easily be changed in an experiment , this peak ( dip ) might be an experimental indication of the center of the anticrossing , which is a regime of interest e.g. for refs .  .",
    "we also studied @xmath4-@xmath9 qubits in the regimes which were presented in our previous work on dqds in gaas / algaas,@xcite i.e. , at large detuning in the anticrossing region of the singlets and at zero detuning . the key result that small detuning is much more favorable regarding the qubit lifetimes than large detuning is valid here too .",
    "we showed that in the anticrossing region even small changes in @xmath86 may shorten @xmath7 and @xmath8 by two orders of magnitude .",
    "we note that the relation @xmath326 , shown in our previous work for the regime of large detuning , does not hold for the usual parameters of experiments with sige / si / sige dqds because of a rather large applied magnetic field gradient .",
    "we showed that the magnetic field gradient can reduce @xmath7 by orders of magnitude .",
    "we demonstrated that the dependence of @xmath7 on tunnel coupling is qualitatively different for different temperatures , which is explained by the behavior of one- and two - phonon processes .",
    "our study of the effect of various system parameters on @xmath7 and @xmath8 shows ways how to prolong the phonon - based decoherence and relaxation times by orders of magnitude .",
