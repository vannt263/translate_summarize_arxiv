    "the study of the properties of young massive star clusters in our local group can be done by means of the census of the stars that belong to the corresponding object and the analysis of their properties using a colour - magnitude diagram . in the case of those objects",
    "whose stellar population can not be resolved with the facilities that are nowadays available , it is necessary to appeal to other tecniques . a possible approach is to study the massive stars by inspecting their effects on the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , including the supply of mechanical energy from stellar winds and supernovae explosions , the ejection of new metals produced in the interiors of the stars , or the excitation and ionization of the atoms in the ism by the energetic photons emitted by the stars .",
    "these factors make the optical spectrum of an hii region to be frequently characterized by the presence of bright prominent recombination lines emitted by hydrogen and helium and of collisional lines emitted by the metals .",
    "although the shape of the stellar continuum and some stellar features are sometimes detectable ( _ e.g. _ the wolf - rayet features ) , the most important source of information about the properties of the ionizing stellar clusters can only be the relative intensities of these lines .",
    "these intensities are mainly dominated by the so - called functional parameters , including the metallicity ( @xmath2 ) , the ionization parameter ( @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ the ratio between ionizing photons and the density of particles ) , and the equivalent effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this last is the unique parameter that only depends on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ionizing star or cluster .",
    "this parameter , denoted by the greek letter @xmath1 , was introduced by vlchez & pagel ( 1988 ) to derive @xmath0 using only the information from emission - line intensities in the optical spectrum .",
    "it is defined as :    @xmath4 3727 \\aa/[oiii ] 4959,5007 \\aa } { [ sii ] 6717,6731 \\aa/[siii ] 9069,9532 } + o(z)\\ ] ]    depending mainly on the ionic abundances of oxygen and sulphur ions .",
    "this ratio is basically a function of the ratio between the number of ionizing photons of o@xmath5 ( i.p .",
    "= 35.1 ev ) and s@xmath5 ( i.p .",
    "= 23.3 ev ) and has also a certain dependence on the overall metallicity [ @xmath6 when it is derived directly from the emission - line intensities .    in the ideal case of a blackbody",
    "it only has a linear relation with the slope of the sed , but for young massive star atmospheres it noticeably changes for different model atmospheres . in upper panels of fig .",
    "1 we show the seds of wm - basic ( pauldrach et al . , 2001 with an expanding spherical geometry ) at left and tlusty ( hubeny & lanz , 1995 , with a plane - paralel geometry ) at right for a same value of @xmath0 ( 40000 k ) and different values of the metallicity",
    ". the slope and the shape of the seds can be very different in the energetic range covered by the optical @xmath1 parameter ( simn - daz & stasiska , 2008 ) .",
    "an alternative to the optical @xmath1 parameter was proposed for the mid - infrared spectral range with emission lines of [ neii ] ( 12.8 @xmath7 m ) , [ neiii ] ( 15.6 @xmath7 m ) , [ siii ] ( 18.7 @xmath7 m ) , and [ siv ] ( 10.5 @xmath7 m ) ( martn - hernndez et al . , 2002 ;",
    "morisset et al . 2004 ) , but this involves an even more energetic range between the ionization potentials of s@xmath8 ( i.p .",
    "= 34.8 ev ) and ne@xmath9 ( i.p .",
    "= 40.5 ev ) , where discrepancies between the different synthesis model atmospheres are larger ( see prez - montero & vlchez , 2009 , for a more detailed discussion ) .    in the lower panels of fig .",
    "1 we show the relation between the optical emission - line ratios of oxygen ( [ oii]/[oiii ] ) and sulphur ( [ sii]/[siii ] ) for a sample of objects with emission - line like spectra compiled by prez - montero & vlchez ( 2009 ) .",

    "one ot the possible caveats when using the @xmath1 parameter to find out @xmath0 in massive star clusters is due to that the information comes from the ionized gas .",
    "this implies that possible variations in the properties of the gas other than the functional parameters , such as gas geometry or density , or dust structure could also affect to the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "we used as a test to check to what extent these variation can affect to the determination of @xmath0 the cloudy photoionization models of the 2d structure of the giant hii region ngc 595 ( prez - montero et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "the observational inputs for these models come from integral field spectroscopy taken with the pmas instrument at the caha 3.5 m telescope in the optical range between 3700  - 6800  ( relao et al . , 2010 ) and photometric information from spitzer space observatory at 8 and 24 @xmath7 m filters . in these models",
    "it was assumed a single ionizing source for all the hii region according to the properties of the cmd diagram derived by malumuth et al .",
    "these models reproduce the variations in the optical and mid - ir properties for different elliptical aperture regions with similar observational properties by assuming different matter - bounded geometries combined with different dust - to - gas ratios , in good agreement to the dust - to - gas ratio derived in the integrated region ( prez - montero et al . , 2011 ) . in fig .",

    "3 we show the relation between the two optical emission - line ratios [ oii]/[oiii ] and [ sii]/[siii ] involved in the @xmath1 parameter with the fits to the photoionization models with tlusty atmospheres shown in lower right panel of fig .",
    "1 . the black circles represent the values derived from the tailored models for each region in ngc 595 . as can be seen , with the exception of some models ,",
    "the most part of the elliptical apertures lie in regions consistent with a single value of @xmath0 across the nebula , independently on the inner variations in the geometry of the gas and in the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the value of @xmath0 ( between 35 kk and 40 kk ) is consistent to the value associated with the properties of the cluster derived by malumuth using a cmd diagram , which is around 40 kk .",
    "it must be noted , however , that neither the slope of the grid of models for ngc 595 nor the slopes of the grids of models for different @xmath0 are equal to 1 , which is the value of the slope for the lines with different @xmath1 across the diagram , so this implies that this parameter must not be used as one - dimensional .",
    "in contrast , its analysis must be undertaken using a 2d approach as in this case .",
    "for instance , in the models of ngc 595 , there is a variation in @xmath1 in a factor 2 which is not contradictory with an homogeneous value of @xmath0 in the models .",

    "black circles represent the models for ngc 595 derived by prez - montero et al .",
    "the determination of properties of a massive young stellar cluster can be obtained by using information from the emission line spectrum from the ionized gas in those cases where the stellar population of the cluster can not be resolved .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter as analyzed in 2 dimensions is a robust method to derive the equivalent effective temperature of a cluster , even in those cases where there are variations in the geometry of the gas or in the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the most important caveat appears as a consequence of the disagreements in the involved energetic ranges between different synthesis model atmospheres , but it is possible to use this to study the relative variations of @xmath0 in homogeneous samples of objects .",
    "this is the case of the variation of @xmath0 across spiral disks found by prez - montero & vlchez ( 2009 ) , which points to a hardening of the ionizing radiation above all in spiral galaxies of low dynamical mass and luminosity with late morphological type .",
