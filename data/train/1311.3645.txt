    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are widely accepted to be the thermonuclear explosion of accreting carbon - oxygen white - dwarfs ( wds ) in close binary systems @xcite . despite numerous studies the nature of the companion of the exploding wd still remains uncertain . presently , there are two models that are widely accepted as plausible descriptions of sn  ia progenitor systems . in the first model , the single - degenerate ( sd ) model , the companion is a non - degenerate star that transfers mass onto the wd @xcite . in a second ,",
    "the double - degenerate ( dd ) model , the secondary is a wd @xcite .",
    "a third model , less widely accepted at present , is the core - degenerate ( cd ) model in which a wd merges with the core of an evolved star during , or shortly after , the common - envelope phase .",
    "one of the major differences between current alternative models is the properties of the gaseous environment surrounding the wd at the time of explosion .",
    "therefore , detection of absorption by circumstellar material ( csm ) in the spectra of sne  ia , or the lack thereof , and the study of its properties might help to disentangle the plausible from the implausible progenitor systems .",
    "* hereafter p07 ) were the first to report the detection of circumstellar material in a sn  ia , sn  2006x , based on time - variability observed in the neutral sodium ( na i ) d absorption lines ( restframe wavelengths @xmath1 ) .",
    "the lack of time variability in the ca  ii  h  &  k lines led p07 to conclude that the observed change in the sodium absorption features was due to the ionization and recombination of circumstellar material , and not a geometrical line - of - sight effect .",
    "p07 based their conclusion arguing that sn  ia uv radiation is severely line - blocked by heavy elements bluewards of @xmath2 @xcite , and is therefore capable of ionizing only material that is relatively near the explosion .",
    "if the material density is sufficiently high it will recombine after maximum light giving rise to variability in observed absorption features .",
    "they suggested a single - degenerate progenitor system for sn  2006x .",
    "following p07 similar studies provided a mixture of results both of detection of time - variable absorption features associated with csm - sn  2007le @xcite , sn  1999cl ( * ? ? ? * using low - spectral - resolution ) and ptf  11kx @xcite - and of non - detection of such features - sn  2000cx @xcite , sn  2007af @xcite .",
    "detected marginally significant time - variability in the sodium features of sn  2011fe that were anyway compatible with interstellar material ( ism ) and not with csm .",
    "this mixture of results suggests that sne  ia might actually arise from two types of progenitor systems , as is suggested by other studies @xcite .",
    "the published sample of sne with multiple high - resolution spectra is too small to allow for a significant conclusion to be drawn .",
    "moreover , it also prevents us from deriving a robust ratio between sne  ia that show evidence of csm and those that do not . for that , a larger sample of sn  ia multi - epoch high - resolution spectra is needed .",
    "* hereafter s11 ) adopted a different approach based on a statistical analysis of a single - epoch high - spectral - resolution sample consisting of 35 sn  ia events .",
    "s11 showed that sne  ia in nearby spiral hosts exhibit a statistically significant overabundance of features that are blueshifted relative to the strongest absorption feature , and this was interpreted as evidence of outflows from @xmath3 of their progenitor systems .",
    "@xcite showed that events classified as blueshifted  la s11 tend to have higher ejecta velocities and redder colors at maximum light compared to the rest of the sn  ia sample .",
    "@xcite used a classification scheme slightly different then that used by s11 to analyze an extended sample consisting of the s11 sample and an additional 17 intermediate - resolution single - epoch spectra , showing a @xmath4 excess of events with blueshifted features .",
    "these analyses lend strong support to the existence of csm in a non - negligible fraction of sne  ia and the possibility of a bimodal distribution of sn  ia progenitors .",
    "nevertheless , one can not use the s11 sample or the @xcite sample to study the properties of the csm as it is not possible to confidently distinguish between csm and ism features for an individual sn in single - epoch spectra .",
    "multi - epoch observations are needed .",
    "in this paper we present multi - epoch high - spectral - resolution observations of 14 type ia events , some of which are from the s11 sample for which only single - epoch spectra were previously published .",
    "publication of such data will help make the published sn  ia multi - epoch high - spectral - resolution sample more complete .",
    "we use this data set , plus literature observations of six other sne , to provide the first robust estimate of the fraction of sne ia exhibiting variable absorption .",
    "we discuss the robustness of the time - variability non - detection and how this effects the consistency of the current multi - epoch high - spectral - resolution sample with previous studies .",

    "one sn , 2009ds , does indeed exhibit variability .",
    "this variability is not as profound as the variability exhibited in the previously published detections , and in the next section we will discuss whether this variability is indicative of csm or whether it is consistent with other explanations .",
    "comparing the shape and ew of the sodium d line features exhibited in the sn  ia events presented in this study reveals no significant time - variability that may be associated with csm in all but one case , sn  2009ds .",
    "a question immediately arises what is the cause of this variability .",
    "the measured change in ew is @xmath23m and @xmath24m .",
    "this change is small compared to the variability observed in sn  2006x , sn  2007le , and ptf  11kx .",
    "it is comperable to the observed variability in sn  2011fe , @xmath25m , which was shown to be consistant with the expected short time - scale variations in interstellar absorptions produced by an expending sn photosphere combined with a patchy ism .",
    "therefore , even if the observed variability is real we conclude that it is most likely associated to the ism and not to the csm environment of sn  2009ds .    as to whether the reported non - detections are robust .",
    "a robust non - detection should have an early first epoch that can serve as a good zero point with which to compare later epochs . as the csm , if present , begins to recombine after maximum light",
    ", the initial epoch should be obtained around maximum light .",
    "an initial spectrum obtained later , might have been obtained after some , or all , of the csm has recombined , and will not serve as a good zero point for comparison .",
    "the first spectra of both sn  2007sa and sn  2011iy were obtained more then 60 days after maximum light .",
    "based on previous csm detections we expect that by this phase any csm that was ionized by the uv flash will have already re - combined ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ew_old ] ) .",
    "therefore , such late spectra can not rule out variability at earlier stages and therefore should not be used as a non - detection and should not be included in statistical analysis of multi - epoch high - spectral - resolution samples of sne  ia .",
    "based on previous cases ( sn  2006x , sn  2007le , and ptf  11kx ) we can not determine that any variability would have been seen between the two closely - spaced epochs we have for sn  2008c ( days + 18 and + 22 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_old ] ) .",
    "so , we argue that this non - detection should not be considered robust . this case emphasizes the need for an early - time first epoch and at least on more well spaced epoch .",
    "the first epochs of the remaining 11 events were obtained no later then 8 days after maximum light .",
    "if we disregard epochs of sn  2006x , sn  2007le , and ptf  11kx that were obtained earlier then 8 days we can still observe significant time - variability in all three events .",
    "therefore , we argue that the non - detection reported for these events are robust .",
    "this criterion will have to be revised if future observations will show events for which all the time - variability occurs earlier then 8 days after maximum light .",
    "the d@xmath6/d@xmath5 ratio for many of our events is considerably larger then 0.5 , the ratio for optically thin gas . in the optically thick regime",
    "the line profiles are less sensitive to changes in the column density , making them harder to identify , especially in low s / n spectra .",
    "nevertheless , the obvious fact that we do not observe time variability in the spectra of these events at these epochs is an indication that the environment along the line - of - sight to these events is different with respect to that along the line - of - sight to sn  2006x , sn  2007le , and ptf  11kx .",
    "in addition , we can not rule out the presence of weak absorption lines that will be undetectable due to the noise in the spectra . following , one can quantify the upper detection limit when no features are apparent in the spectrum as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spectral resolution , @xmath28 the root - mean - square fluctuations of the normalized flux , w@xmath29 is the width of the feature , and b is the number of bins per resolution element . assuming that these lines are optically thin we can follow @xcite and use the curve - of - growth to convert equivalent width into column densities using , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the oscillator strength . given the different spectral resolution of the different instruments and the s / n of the different observations , and assuming @xmath32 , we can conclude that any feature arising from a na  i column density of more then a few times @xmath33 @xmath34 should have been detectable in the spectra of the majority of these events .",
    "the extreme cases are sn  2012fr , for which the detectability limit is @xmath35 @xmath34 and sn  2007on and sn  2008dt , for which the limits are @xmath36 @xmath34 and @xmath37 @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "therefore , a line - of - sight environment similar to those observed for sn  2006x , sn2007le , and ptf  11kx should have produced detectable lines .",
    "assuming all the sodium is neutral and a solar abundance ratio , @xmath38 , we get a hydrogen column density limit of @xmath39 @xmath34 . assuming this material is distributed in a thin spherical shell at radius @xmath40 the mass of the shell will be , @xmath41 though this estimate is only a rough estimate and most likely an over estimate . for sn  2012fr",
    "the limit is approximately one order of magnitude lower .",
    "our spectroscopic observations only probe the csm along the line - of - sight , therefore , we can not rule out presence of material off the line - of - sight .",
    "nevertheless , simulations of proposed progenitor systems may offer an insight to whether they can form csm in a way that allows for line - of - sight environments that are consistent with our observations , especially the relatively clean featureless line - of - sights observed toward sn  2007on , sn  2012fr , sn  2012ht , and sn  2013aa .",
    "such a comparison between theoretical results and the observed multi - epoch high - spectral - resolution sample can be highly insightful , but remains beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our data extends the published multi - epoch high - spectral - resolution sample size to 17 events for which robust detection or non - detection can be claimed .",
    "three events exhibit time - variable na  i  d features attributed to csm . assuming poisson statistics we find that @xmath42 ( @xmath43 if we exclude sn  2007on which occurred in an elliptical host ) of the events in the enlarged sample exhibit time - variable features that can be associated with csm .",
    "this result is in agreement with the results of s11 and @xcite who estimated the fraction to be @xmath44 of nearby sne  ia in late - type galaxy hosts .",
    "this estimate is a lower limit as csm may lay off the line - of - sight or on the line - of - sight but further away from the progenitor system . in the first case",
    "this material will not be visible in the spectrum .",
    "in the later , the csm lines will not vary with time and be regarded as a non - detection . moreover , though this is the largest multi - epoch high - spectral - resolution sn  ia sample to date it is still relatively small",
    ". a larger sample will be useful to shed light on the ratio between sne  ia with csm and those without .",
