    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) has been tremendously successful in describing low - energy hadronic interactions in the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "it provides for a systematic and well - defined perturbative expansion incorporating interaction physics driven by the symmetries of qcd in kinematic regimes where scales are well - defined .",
    "calculations have been performed for many problems to next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) in a variety of bases , but the challenge is often in determining the range of valid and contributing degrees of freedom to a given problem .    with recent developments in the automatization of the nlo calculations in perturbative field theory ,",
    "it is reasonable to consider the possibility that these methods could also be applied to chpt and thus allow for a broader application of the theory .    to date",
    ", there are several packages available ( feynarts @xcite , formcalc @xcite , feyncalc @xcite and form @xcite ) allowing us to produce semi - automatic calculations in particle physics .",
    "these packages have been applied in various calculations relevant to studies of the standard model @xcite .",
    "although feynarts and formcalc were originally designed for standard model calculations , the flexibility of the programs allows us to extend them to interactions appropriate for the hadronic sector .",
    "this was a main reason to use feynarts and formcalc as a base languages for the automatization of chiral hadronic calculations .",

    "let us start with a general review of the formalism we use to describe the dynamics of the strong interactions .",

    "unfortunately , despite of tremendous experimental efforts , production of this state proved to be extremely problematic .",
    "the experimental difficulties emerge from the weak signal , low statistics , and high background in all production channels .    from the point of view of relativistic chpt it is possible to introduce pentaquark baryons in to the computational hadronic model due to the same symmetry of the chiral lagrangian and similarities of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 irreducible representations of the @xmath107 group . if one assumes that octet of the pentaquarks is represented by the spin @xmath108 states , and the anti - decuplet of resonances by the spin @xmath46 , it easy to construct a lagrangian for both . using notation of @xcite",

    "the clebsh - gordan coefficients for the pentaquark states were computed in the same way as in eq.([a5 ] ) and eq.([a5a ] ) but with coupling constants taken from lagrangian in eq.([eq : penta ] ) .",
    "it is natural to raise a question : if the @xmath103 does exist , how can chiral effective theory direct experimental searches for this state ? one of the possibilities would be to look at the kinematic dependencies ( see @xcite ) using our computational hadronic model .",
    "there are three possible channels for the production @xmath103 : photo- , hadro- and lepto - production .",
    "the most recent experimental efforts were directed to the photo - production of the @xmath103 .",

    "[ fig : penta_photo],title=\"fig : \" ]    the largest contribution comes from the contact term which is only present for the neutron target . comparing our results to @xcite we can see what s- and u - channel cross sections are somewhat larger in our case .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that , unlike in chm model , the couplings in @xcite are adjusted by the four - dimensional formfactors , and , since in these channels baryons are further off - shell , the contribution of these channels is strongly suppressed . as for the contact and t - channel contribution , our results are close to @xcite .",
    "the evident asymmetry between neutron and proton targets favors deuterium target ( with proton as a spectator ) for the photo - production of the @xmath131 with production cross section around @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "although the chm predictions of the pentaquark photoproduction confirmed the earlier theoretical findings , our calculations are done using the born approximation only , and hence it is reasonable to raise the question about the validity of our chm extension of feynarts and formcalc for the next - to - the - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations .    to test our nlo calculations ( not including resonances ) we decided to compute amplitudes for the compton scattering off the proton and neutron . if we consider a nucleon with structure , the compton scattering amplitude in the rest frame has the following form @xcite:@xmath134 here , @xmath135 is the polarization vector , frequency and momenta of the incoming photon , respectively .",
    "primed quantities denote the outgoing photon .",
    "two structure constants @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon .",
    "for the point like nucleon , we have ( see fig.([fig : compton - tree ] ) ) :    @xmath138    ]    this amplitude , in order to satisfy the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic current @xmath139 is not renormalized , and expressed through the set of physical observables such as charge and mass .",
    "moreover , in the thomson limit when @xmath140 , the compton amplitude @xmath141 in eq.([a7 ] ) should take the form of @xmath142 in eq.([a6 ] ) according to the well known low - energy theorem .",
    "hence , when soft photons are considered , the nucleon behaves as a point - like particle and structure constants of eq.([a7 ] ) could be calculated only through the loop diagrams .",
    "although generally the loop contribution is ultraviolet divergent and requires renormalization , this is not a case for the compton scattering .",
    "if @xmath143 , @xmath142 is not renormalized and the limit @xmath140 does not remove ultraviolet divergences , then the amplitude @xmath141 should be finite .",
    "if we take only the @xmath144 triplet of the mesons , we will have to evaluate 22 diagrams for the neutron and 52 diagrams for the proton ( see fig.([fig : loop - su2 ] ) ) .    ]",
    "it is necessary to mention that the diagrams on fig.([fig : loop - su2 ] ) represent only generic types of the topologies allowed in compton scattering .",
    "when one employs chm , the full set of graphs will have to include the crossed diagrams and wave function renormalization graphs absorbed into counterterms .",
    "also , in the chm , charged mesons are treated as non - selfconjugate fields which effectively induce double counting , so part of the final amplitude with the charged mesons in the loops has to be divided by the factor of two .",
    "individually , the diagrams on fig.([fig : loop - su2 ] ) give the divergent contributions but their sum should be a finite result .",
    "that was a case when compton amplitude was computed in the chm .",
    "we observed analytically that the final compton amplitude is , in fact , finite ( i.e. free of ultraviolet divergences ) .",
    "moreover , we have successfully tested finiteness of the compton amplitude for the @xmath107 octet of mesons .",
    "here we have calculated 44 graphs for the neutron and 104 ( not including wave function renormalization graphs ) for the proton and observed no ultraviolet divergences in the final amplitude . in the formcalc ,",
    "the final results ( amplitude or compton tensor ) were presented analytically using the passarino - veltman basis . due to the cumbersome nature of this type of calculations",
    "we leave analytical details out of this article .",
    "although we can proceed and express polarizabilities of the nucleon numerically , we leave that for the next publication .",
    "we have satisfied purpose of this article already when ultraviolet finite results for the compton amplitude were obtained up to nlo using our computational hadronic model .",
    "in the present work we have developed an extension ( the computational hadronic model ) of feynarts and formcalc to include the hadronic sector using chiral perturbation theory . we have included octet of mesons , baryons ( and pentaquark baryons ) plus the decuplet of resonances ( and the anti - decuplet of pentaquark resonances ) .",
    "the chms provides a robust prediction of the asymmetry in pentaquark @xmath103 photoproduction between neutron and proton targets .",
    "it can be concluded that the asymmetry is caused by the presence of the contact term in the @xmath145channel .",
    "the ability of the chm to handle next - to - the - leading - order calculations was tested through the fact that the compton scattering amplitude should be ultraviolet finite and should not be renormalized .",
    "as was expected , even when the entire octet of mesons was included , the final amplitude did not exhibit any ultraviolet divergent behavior .",
    "the nlo results of the chm can be expressed analytically using formcalc , with an amplitude expressed in the passarino - veltman basis as well as numerically with application of the package looptools .",
