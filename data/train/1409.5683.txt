    "more refined angle statistics has been studied only recently : boca , paol , popa and zaharescu @xcite studied the pair correlation statistics for hyperbolic angles when @xmath5 and @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and gave conjectures for all lattices @xmath8 and all base points @xmath9 .",

    "we want to investigate how much @xmath39 deviates from @xmath30 in the limit as @xmath23 .",
    "our first result is the following theorem which asserts that the limit as @xmath23 does indeed exist :    [ main theorem ] let @xmath41 and let @xmath42 be a lattice as above .",

    "the fact that the function @xmath45 in theorem [ main theorem ] can be given explicitly ( see , , and remark [ n=2,3 ] ) , allows us to determine the asymptotic behavior of the pair correlation density :    [ main theorem - asymptotics ] fix @xmath57 as above .",

    "the function @xmath77  which by theorem [ main theorem ] and theorem [ restricted - main - theorem ] determines the pair correlation density @xmath61 both in the whole space and in sectors  depends , apart from @xmath62 and @xmath78 , only on @xmath0 and @xmath79 .",
    "it follows that @xmath61 depends on the group @xmath1 only through the sequence @xmath80 in fact , it turns out that this sequence determines and is determined by @xmath61 and the volume @xmath81 . using this we show , in section [ friday - afternoon ] , that @xmath61 determines and is determined by certain spectral data .",
    "we refer to section [ friday - afternoon ] for precise statements .    the idea of the proof of theorem [ main theorem ] ( which is the basis for most of the subsequent results ) is as follows : considering the results in @xcite , we expect the pair correlation density to be expressible as a sum over @xmath82 .",

    "we show several stability results for angles and norms , which are later used for certain approximation arguments . in section [ vols ]",
    "we find expressions for @xmath89 given in terms of the functions @xmath90 , and in section [ counts - to - vols ] we show how these volumes are related to @xmath91 .",
    "in section [ proofs ] we tie these investigations together and complete the proofs of all the main theorems .",
    "several of these results use basic properties of the function @xmath45 , and we state and prove such properties in appendix [ appendix ] .    in a very recent paper , marklof and vinogradov @xcite show how the mixing property of the geodesic flow can be used to obtain information about the distribution of directions in a hyperbolic lattice .",
    "they show convergence of all mixed moments of the appropriate counting functions , which in particular allows them to conclude convergence of pair correlations .",
    "in fact their results capture all local statistics ( e.g. gap or nearest neighbor distributions ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the pair correlation and use information on the decay of matrix coefficients to get more explicit and precise results .      throughout this manuscript we consider @xmath0 and @xmath92 as fixed . in all estimates , the implied constants may depend on @xmath0 and @xmath92 ; any other dependence will be specified .",

    "furthermore , using lemma [ stuff ] , we find that we may drop the condition @xmath678 in the above summation ; the error term introduced in this step is subsumed in the error term @xmath679 .",
