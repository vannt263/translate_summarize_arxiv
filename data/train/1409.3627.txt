    "it has been known for some time that gamma rays from tev blazars can probe the intergalactic magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "photons with tev energy from such beamed sources scatter off the extra - galactic background light ( ebl ) and produce electron - positron pairs also with tev energy  @xcite .",
    "these charged particles then inverse - compton scatter off cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons and up - scatter them to a cascade of gev photons .",
    "these gev gamma rays potentially carry information about the electron - positron trajectories . in particular ,",
    "if the electron - positron are deflected by ambient magnetic fields , the cascade gamma rays observed at gev energies also carry information about the ambient magnetic fields .",
    "a few years ago , observations of four tev blazars by the fermi large area telescope  ( fermi - lat ) experimentand the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) gamma ray telescope were used to obtain a lower bound of @xmath2 on the intergalactic magnetic field strength  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is based on the observed deficit of gev photons , the assumption being that the deficit is due to deflection of the electron - positron pairs due to an inter - galactic magnetic field .",
    "the assumption has since been debated  @xcite , with the concern that there is an instability in the propagation of high energy charged particles in the cosmological medium that tends to isotropize the directions of the charged particles thus explaining the observed deficit of gev photons .",
    "more recently , developing ideas first proposed in the context of cosmic rays  @xcite , we have shown that the cascade gev gamma rays from tev blazars may also be used to probe _ helical _ magnetic fields as the helicity introduces a parity odd signature in the arrival directions of the gamma rays  @xcite .",
    "if observed , a parity violating signal around blazars would be hard to explain on the basis of a plasma instability but easier to explain with magnetic field helicity . in turn",
    ", primordial magnetic field helicity would be an invaluable probe of cp violation in the early universe with profound consequences for very high energy particle physics and the origin of matter  @xcite .",
    "a magnetic field in the post - recombination universe can be a critical ingredient that enables cosmic structure formation  @xcite .",
    "most recently , we have extended the scheme to look for parity odd signatures in gamma rays from a single source to the diffuse gamma ray background over the entire sky  @xcite .",
    "this extension is particularly necessary if the cascade deflections are large and the observed gev gamma rays are not obviously associated with any tev blazar source .",
    "further , we have applied our scheme to the diffuse gamma rays observed by fermi - lat , and find a significant parity odd signal .",
    "interpreted in terms of a helical magnetic field , we find a field strength @xmath1 on intergalactic scales with left - handed helicity .",
    "if ongoing observations continue to confirm the parity odd signal , we should be able to use the gamma ray signal to reconstruct spectral properties of the intergalactic field .",
    "more specifically , the equal - time correlation function of a stochastic , isotropic , magnetic field in minkowski spacetime can be written as  @xcite b_i ( x ) b_j ( y ) = m_n ( r ) ( _ ij - ) + m_l(r ) + m_h ( r ) _ ijl r^l , [ magcorr ] where @xmath3 and , due to the divergence free condition of magnetic fields , @xmath4 we would like to relate the `` normal '' and `` helical '' power spectra , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , to correlators of the observed cascade gev gamma rays . in  @xcite , we had related @xmath7 to a parity odd correlator of cascade gamma rays from a known source . in the present paper we will extend that analysis to the case of diffuse gamma rays , when the source locations are not known .",
    "further , if @xmath8 , it allows for a new way to also estimate the normal power spectrum from correlation functions of cascade gamma rays .    in sec .",
    "[ parityoddcorrelators ] we will introduce our strategy in more detail , first in the context of a single source , then in the context of many sources and when additional non - cascade photons are present in the data .",
    "we will find that the parity odd signal can be a valuable tool for extracting information not just about the magnetic field but also about the relative number of cascade and non - cascade photons , which is related to the number of tev blazars .",

    "the sign of @xmath178 depends on the handedness of the magnetic field and , except when there is a lot of power on small distance scales , we expect @xmath179 for left - handed fields . in addition , the shape of @xmath0 is sensitive to the fraction of cascade to non - cascade photons in the sky , thus possibly providing a tool to study the distribution and properties of cascade photons from tev blazars .    using our results",
    ", we can obtain a numerical estimate of the helical power spectrum . from eq .",
    "( [ qinfty1 ] ) we estimate | d_12 m_h(|d_12| ) | ~ ( 3 10 ^ -16   g)^2 e_1 ^ 3/2 e_2 ^ 3/2 ( ) ^2 ( ) ( 1+z_s)^12 ~ ^2 , [ magestimate ] where , in the last estimate we have used @xmath180 , @xmath181 , _ i.e. _ @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 @xcite , @xmath185 from eq .",
    "( [ qpeakqinfty ] ) with @xmath186 , and denoted @xmath187 .",
    "therefore we estimate b_0 1.5 10 ^ -14 d_s1 ( 1+z_s)^4   g ,  from  peak  amplitude [ b0frompeakamplitude ] where @xmath168 is the magnetic field strength at the present epoch and we have taken the field strength to evolve in proportion to @xmath188 . from  @xcite",
    "we find that the peak in @xmath0 is located at @xmath189 when @xmath180 , @xmath181 .",
    "then from eq .",
    "( [ eq : final_ang_est ] ) , with @xmath190  recall that the peak position is determined by @xmath60 as in eq .",
    "( [ rpeak ] )  we find b_0 8 10 ^ -14 d_s1 ( 1+z_s)^4   g ,   from  peak  location [ b0frompeaklocation ] this rough agreement between the two independent estimates in eq .",
    "( [ b0frompeakamplitude ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ b0frompeaklocation ] ) is quite remarkable and suggests that the intergalactic magnetic fields are significantly , if not maximally , helical .    in conclusion",
    ", we have developed the connection between our proposed parity odd correlator , @xmath0 , and properties of the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "we find encouraging agreement between independent estimates of the magnetic field strength using observed data , thus providing further confidence in the robustness of the signal discussed in  @xcite .",
    "there is also some tentative indication in the observed @xmath0 to peak at smaller angles at higher @xmath60 @xcite which is in agreement with the trend in fig .",
    "[ fig : qvsr ] .",
    "another interesting observation is that if we combine eq .",
    "( [ qpeakqinfty ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ qinfty1 ] ) and assume that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ qinfty1 ] ) dominates , we find q_peak ~- ( ) ^2 .",
    "hence , for a scale invariant spectrum , @xmath191 depends only on @xmath60 and there is little dependence on @xmath59 .",
    "we have also seen that @xmath192 is independent of @xmath59 ( see eq .",
    "( [ rpeak ] ) ) . thus both @xmath192 and @xmath191 are only sensitive to @xmath60 for a spectrum that is not too steep . indeed , in the plots obtained from fermi data for @xmath193 there is a peak with amplitude @xmath194 at roughly @xmath195 regardless of the value of @xmath59 , again showing consistency with the intergalactic magnetic fields hypothesis .",
    "further , eq .  ( [ rpeak ] ) predicts that @xmath0 will peak at @xmath196 when @xmath197 and at @xmath198 when @xmath199 ; the height of the peak is sensitive to the noise to signal ratio , @xmath200 , and to the helicity power spectrum .",
    "we close with a few cautionary remarks .",
    "our analytic methods have been possible only because we have made several simplifying assumptions along the way .",
    "for example , we have ignored the stochasticity of the pair production  which depends on the ebl spectrum  and the cmb up - scattering processes .",
    "monte carlo methods seem to be most suitable for including these processes though simulations will be challenging because of the range of length scales involved ( kpc to gpc ) .",
    "we hope the rewards of discovering helical intergalactic magnetic fields and the enormous implications for particle physics and cosmology will spur further investigations .",

    "take @xmath201 , @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 .",
    "this is a right - handed configuration because the magnetic field rotates counterclockwise as one goes from the origin to @xmath206 .",
