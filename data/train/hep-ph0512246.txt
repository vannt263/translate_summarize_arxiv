    "the top quark yukawa coupling ( @xmath1 ) is the largest coupling of the higgs boson to fermions .",
    "a precise measurement of it is very important since the it may help unravel the secrets of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism , in which the top quark could possibly play a key role . for @xmath2 ,",
    "a direct measurement of @xmath1 is possible via associated @xmath3 production , both at the lhc and a future @xmath4 international linear collider ( ilc ) . at the lhc ,",
    "the expected accuracy  @xcite is @xmath5 for @xmath6 gev , assuming an integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath7 .",
    "existing feasibility studies at the ilc  @xcite predict an accuracy of @xmath8 for @xmath9 gev , assuming @xmath10 gev and 1000 fb@xmath7 .",
    "however , currently the baseline design for the ilc only contemplates a maximum center - of - mass energy of 500 gev .",
    "therefore , it is very relevant to explore the prospects of this measurement during the first phase of the ilc , especially in view of the limited accuracy expected at the lhc : for a number of years , the combination of results from the lhc and ilc would yield the most precise determination of @xmath1 .",
    "a preliminary feasibility study at @xmath0 gev was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we briefly overview here .",
    "indeed , the measurement of @xmath1 at @xmath0 gev is more challenging than at @xmath10 gev . on the one hand , the reduced phase - space leads to a large reduction in @xmath11 ( e.g. @xmath12 fb at @xmath13 gev , for @xmath14 gev ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross section for many background processes is significantly increased .",
    "this analysis assumed @xmath14 gev and focused on the @xmath15 decay channel ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the dominant background is @xmath17 , followed by @xmath18 , although other non - interfering backgrounds ( e.g. @xmath19 ) were also considered .",
    "signal and backgrounds were processed through a fast detector simulation .",
    "after basic preselection cuts , the signal efficiency was found to be @xmath20 and the @xmath21 .",
    "in order to increase the sensitivity , a multivariate analysis using a neural network ( nn ) with 23 variables was performed .",
    "the final selection consisted on an optimized cut on the nn distribution . assuming an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath7 , the expected total number of signal and background events was 11 and 51 , respectively , resulting in @xmath22 .",
    "based on previous experience  @xcite , the addition of the fully hadronic decay channel was expected to ultimately lead to @xmath23 . while this analysis is already rather sophisticated , significant improvements are expected from e.g. the usage of a more efficient @xmath24-tagging algorithm or a more optimal treatment of the kinematic information . in the next sections we discuss additional sources of improvement which are currently under investigation .",
    "the precise measurement of @xmath1 requires accurate theoretical predictions for @xmath11 . currently , one - loop qcd and electroweak corrections are available . however , at @xmath0 gev and for @xmath25 gev , the kinematic region where the @xmath26 system is non - relativistic dominates . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in this regime coulomb singularities are important and need to be resummed within the framework of the vnrqcd effective theory , leading to large enhancements factors in the cross section relative to the born level . at the ilc ,",
    "because of isr and beamstrahlung ( bs ) , the event - by - event center - of - mass energy ( @xmath27 ) will be lower than the nominal one , thus bringing the @xmath26 system deeper into the non - relativistic regime . in order to compute the expected @xmath11 including these effects ,",
    "the 11-fold born differential cross section for @xmath28 was multiplied by a k - factor defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 stands for the higgs boson energy in the @xmath4 rest - frame , and then folded with isr and bs structure functions .",
    "the nll differential cross section was kindly provided by the authors of ref .",
    "[ combo](left and center ) compares the born ( for off - shell top quarks ) and nll differential cross sections for different values of @xmath27 , assuming @xmath31 gev and @xmath14 gev .",
    "the ratio of these two curves defines @xmath32 and can be significantly larger than 1 , especially for low values of @xmath27 .",
    "since the nll prediction is only valid for @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 effectively corresponds to a cut on the top quark velocity in the @xmath26 rest - frame of @xmath35 ) , we currently set @xmath36 for @xmath37 , although in practice , it should be possible to use @xmath38 .",
    "table  [ sigmatth ] compares the predicted born and `` nll - improved '' @xmath11 for different scenarios , illustrating the large impact of radiative effects in the initial state .",
    "this underscores the importance of being able to predict these effects to the percent level .",
    "while the impact of isr can not be reduced , it might be possible to find an optimal operating point of the accelerator , as far as this measurement is concerned , in terms of bs and total integrated luminosity .",
    "finally , it is found that , for @xmath14 gev , resummation effects can increase @xmath11 by a factor of @xmath39 with respect to the born cross section , used in the previous feasibility study .",
    ".comparison of the born and nll @xmath11 for different scenarios regarding radiative effects in the initial state . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sigmatth ]",
    "so far , all feasibility studies of this measurement have assumed unpolarized beams .",
    "currently , the baseline design for the ilc only includes longitudinal electron beam polarization ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "positron beam polarization ( @xmath41 ) is considered as an option .",
    "the ratio of the polarized cross section ( for arbitrary longitudinal beam polarization ) ( @xmath42 ) to the unpolarized cross section ( @xmath43 ) is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the `` effective polarization '' and @xmath46 is the `` left - right asymmetry '' of the process of interest  @xcite .",
    "therefore , two potential enhancement factors can in principle be exploited : the first one requires having both beams polarized , the second one requires @xmath47 and a judicious choice of the signs of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in order to have @xmath50 . in the case of sm @xmath3 production , @xmath51 , essentially independent of @xmath52 in the range @xmath53 tev . assuming @xmath54 , fig .",
    "[ combo](right ) shows the cross section enhancement factor as a function of @xmath49 , for different values of @xmath48 .",
    "the optimal ( realistic ) operating point would be @xmath55 , achieving an increase in @xmath11 by a factor of @xmath56 with respect to the unpolarized case .",
    "unfortunately , this choice does not help reduce the dominant background , which is increased by a similar factor .",
    "nevertheless , the net result is still an improvement in the statistical precision on @xmath1 by @xmath57 , which would be an argument in favor of including positron polarization in the baseline design . for @xmath58 , only a modest increase in @xmath11 by a factor of @xmath59 would be achieved .",
    "it is important to realize that , in order to choose the sign of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , it is necessary to know the sign of @xmath46 .",
    "anomalous couplings in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 vertices could possibly lead to deviations in @xmath46 from the sm prediction .",
    "unfortunately , due to the limited precision in the measurement of the @xmath61 couplings  @xcite , the lhc is not expected to provide any useful constraints on the sign of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , at the ilc the first step should be to perform measurements of the polarized @xmath62 in order to determine the sign of @xmath46 , and thus fix the signs of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( the magnitudes should be largest possible ) .",
    "on the other hand , admittedly the measurement of @xmath1 requires a percent - level and model - independent determination of the @xmath63 and @xmath18 couplings , which typically benefits from changing the beam polarization .",
    "therefore , it would be desirable to optimize the running strategy to maintain the largest possible @xmath11 , needed for a precise measurement of @xmath1 , while meeting the precision goals for measurements of top quark couplings .",
    "we have studied the prospects of a precise measurement of the top quark yukawa coupling during the first phase of the ilc .",
    "taking into consideration an existing feasibility study , and the additional enhancement factors to @xmath11 discussed here , we anticipate a precision of @xmath64 for @xmath14 gev , assuming @xmath0 gev and 1000 fb@xmath7 .",
