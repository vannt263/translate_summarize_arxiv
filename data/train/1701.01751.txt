    "suppose that @xmath1 is hyperbolic , that is , its complement admits a riemannian metric of constant sectional curvature @xmath7 which is complete and of finite volume .",
    "then thurston s hyperbolic dehn surgery theorem implies that all but finitely many slopes produce hyperbolic manifolds via surgery @xcite .",
    "the exceptional cases are called exceptional slopes and exceptional surgeries .",
    "it is a consequence of the geometrization theorem that every exceptional surgery on a hyperbolic _ link _ is @xmath0 , a lens space , has an essential surface of non - negative euler characteristic , or fibres over the sphere with three exceptional fibres .",
    "we now assign the following standard names to these classes of non - hyperbolic 3-manifolds following @xcite .",
    "we say that a manifold is of type @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 if it contains , respectively , an essential disc , annulus , sphere or torus , and of type @xmath12 or @xmath13 if it contains a heegaard sphere or torus .",

    "notice that @xmath15 and @xmath13 is the set of lens spaces ( including @xmath16 ) .",
    "the distance ( minimal geometric intersection ) between two slopes @xmath5 , @xmath17 on a torus is denoted @xmath18 .",
    "the _ maximal distance between types of exceptional manifolds _ @xmath19 and @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 ) and denoted @xmath22 .",
    "quite some energy has been devoted in the literature to the understanding of exceptional slopes on hyperbolic manifolds . in the case of hyperbolic knot exteriors",
    "there are strong restrictions on their exceptional surgeries or fillings .",
    "the @xmath0 filling is unique @xcite and ( obviously ) no knot exterior has a filling with an essential annulus or disc .",
    "conjecturally no hyperbolic knot exterior has a reducible surgery @xcite .",

    "the @xmath23 pairs are conjecturally a subset of the berge knots classified in @xcite .",
    "it follows that , since the remaining three cases all involve a @xmath33 surgery , an enumeration of the remaining three exceptional pairs is conjecturally an enumeration of a subset of berge knots .",
    "baker showed @xcite that 10 of the 12 classes of berge knots are obtained by surgery on the minimally twisted 5-chain link ( 5cl , see figure  [ chain_links_fig ] ) .",
    "so , conjecturally , most of the hyperbolic knots realising @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 exceptional pairs of slopes are obtained by surgery on 5cl .",
    "in this article we enumerate all hyperbolic knots obtained from surgery on the 5cl that realise the maximum known distance between the exceptional filling types .",
    "we completely classify the knots arising in this manner and having two different lens space surgeries ; having a lens space surgery and a toroidal surgery at distance 3 ; and having a lens space surgery and a small seifert surgery at distance 2 . in light of baker s work , the classification in this article conjecturally accounts for most examples of hyperbolic knots with an exceptional pair of slopes at maximal distance .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath1 be a hyperbolic knot in @xmath0 obtained by surgery on the minimally twisted 5-chain link with two exceptional slopes @xmath5 and @xmath17 , and let @xmath6 be a lens space .",
    "the following statements are true :    * if @xmath34 is a lens space then @xmath1 is in found in figure [ lens_lens_fig ] . *",

    "it is natural to generalise these types of questions by asking whether we can find @xmath46 for each pair of classes @xmath47 , and whether we can enumerate all @xmath48 of type @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "a great deal is known , see @xcite or @xcite for an overview .",
    "if a knot in @xmath0 is not a torus knot or a satellite knot then its exterior is a hyperbolic 3-manifold .",

    "the chain links that are ubiquitous throughout this paper are depicted in figure [ chain_links_fig ] .",
    "we keep the notation conventions of @xcite and denote the minimally twisted 5-chain link by 5cl and its exterior by @xmath56 ; the 4-chain link is denoted 4cl and its exterior is denoted @xmath57 .",
    "a @xmath7 surgery on any component of 4cl gives a 3-chain link 3cl , whose exterior is denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "we closely reference the tables from @xcite which give a classification of the exceptional surgeries on the mirror @xmath59 shown in figure [ chain_links_fig ] .",
    "the exterior of this link is the `` magic manifold '' @xcite which we will denote by @xmath60 .",
    "the manifold @xmath61 , the exterior of the minimally twisted 4-chain link , will also appear extensively in the text .",
    "the knots in figures  [ lens_lens_fig ] and  [ lens_toroidal_z_fig ] are described by giving a filling instruction on two of the 3 boundary components of the magic manifold .",
    "the exceptional slopes on the knots @xmath62 and @xmath63 from figure [ lens_lens_fig ] and corresponding fillings are found in theorem  [ lens_lens_thm ] . on the other hand , the exceptional slopes on @xmath64 and @xmath65 from figure [ lens_toroidal_z_fig ] and",
    "the corresponding fillings are found in theorem [ lens_toroidal_prop ] .",
    "furthermore , theorems  [ lens_lens_thm ] and [ lens_toroidal_prop ] go further and show that the three families of knots and the isolated example shown in figures [ lens_lens_fig ] and [ lens_toroidal_z_fig ] are all distinct knots .",
    "there is a unique hyperbolic knot in a torus with two non - trivial surgeries @xcite ; the exterior of this knot is called the berge manifold , which will appear frequently in the text .",
    "it can be obtained by filling one of the 3 boundary components of the magic manifold @xmath60 .",
    "indeed , the berge manifold is @xmath66 .",
    "cutting , twisting and filling the boundary of the torus yields an infinite family of inequivalent knots in @xmath0 with two lens space fillings .",

    "the results in this article are obtained by a careful analysis of the classifications of exceptional sets of slopes on surgeries of the minimally twisted 5-chain link given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the work done there , translates the enumeration of exceptional pairs realising maximal distances into finding the solutions to a ( long ) list of elementary diophantine equations .",
