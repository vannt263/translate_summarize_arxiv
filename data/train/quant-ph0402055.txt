    "the burgeoning field of quantum information science is beginning to provide us with hints that quantum systems are capable of performing spectacularly powerful information processing tasks .",
    "an example of this is the existence of a _ quantum algorithm _ , shor s algorithm , which can factor in polynomial time @xcite .",
    "a consequence of discoveries such as shor s factoring algorithm is the emergence of a widespread belief that , parallel to the physical resource of _ information _ , there is a corresponding resource which quantum systems support called _",
    "quantum information_. the study of how quantum information can be manipulated and processed is the central goal of quantum information science .",
    "so what is quantum information ?",
    "it is folklore within the quantum information community that it may be _ quantum entanglement _ , the unique property possessed by quantum states of bipartite systems not expressible as simple tensor products .",
    "a classic example of an entangled state is the singlet @xmath0 , which is commonly considered to be the _",
    "fundamental unit _ of entanglement .",
    "there are a number of fascinating information processing tasks which use entangled states as a resource , such as teleportation @xcite and enhanced classical communication @xcite .    throughout the progress of the research conducted in quantum information science , in particular in the study of quantum entanglement , a number of fascinating mathematical problems have been encountered . within the theory of quantum entanglement and quantum communication",
    "these problems can be broadly described as the the classification of positive operators on tensor products of vector spaces .",
    "this classification problem is central to these theories .",
    "many of the stumbling blocks currently encountered by researchers in quantum information science are due to incomplete results in this classification program .    despite the many problems encountered , a fruitful interplay between mathematics and physics has already resulted from progress in this classification program .",
    "an example of this is the recent work on indecomposable positive linear maps . in this case a result obtained previously by woronowicz @xcite was applied by pawe horodecki to construct quantum states which have the property that they are _ bound entangled _",
    "@xcite ( for a review of bound entanglement and distillable entanglement see the paper @xcite ) .",
    "the subsequent work on bound entanglement was then fed back into mathematics by terhal @xcite , who used this work in physics to construct new indecomposable positive linear maps .",
    "bound entanglement is a particular nonlocal phenomena exhibited by certain mixed states which falls within the framework of mixed - state entanglement , or the study of nonlocal quantum features of mixed states .",
    "understanding mixed - state entanglement is an immediate and pressing priority in quantum information science .",
    "this is because a number of expected developments in areas such as quantum communication can not take place until certain questions about mixed - state entanglement are answered .",
    "quite apart from the ramifications for quantum information , we believe that the study of mixed - state entanglement will lead to new and interesting results in mathematics .",
    "in particular , there are suggestive indications ( see , for example , the work on _ concurrence _ for some striking results @xcite ) that there are deep results waiting to be found in the field of matrix analysis .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a method to evaluate certain functions on the space of positive operators , called mixed - state entanglement measures .",
    "to do so , in ",
    "[ sec : prelims ] we begin by establishing some results in convexity theory . these results allow us to state our main result , a necessary condition for constructing convex hulls of certain subsets . in  [ sec : poincare ] we make the observation that quantum state - space can be represented by the convex hull of a quadratic algebraic variety . finally , in  [ sec : entmeas ] we combine these two results to provide an implicit representation for a family of mixed - state entanglement measures , namely those based on the roof construction .",
    "in this section we introduce the main object of study for this paper : the convex or concave roof .",
    "we also establish some general results concerning the construction and evaluation of roofs , the most important result being proposition  [ thm : spanub ] .",
    "we illustrate the definitions and results throughout this section in terms of a simplified example .",
    "we begin by establishing some notation .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the subset of @xmath2 formed from the intersection of the zero - sets of a collection of polynomials @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 $ ] , which we write as @xmath6 the set @xmath1 is known as an _ affine algebraic variety_. we assume that this set is compact in the standard topology on @xmath2 , irreducible , and nonsingular , i.e. , @xmath1 is a nonsingular variety .",
    "( for a gentle introduction to varieties and algebraic geometry , including definitions of the terms we use here , see @xcite and @xcite . for a more complete reference see @xcite . )",
    "we have assumed that @xmath1 is irreducible and nonsingular in order to avoid various pathologies associated with the definition of the tangent space for these spaces .",
    "it should be noted that it is possible , with a little extra work , to extend the results of this section to include these cases . however , for our applications the assumption of nonsingularity imposes no limitations , so we ignore singular varieties .",
    "let @xmath7 be an arbitrary continuous scalar - valued function defined on @xmath1 .",
    "( the assumption of continuity is invoked so that subsequent constructions are at least continuous . )",
    "it suffices for most of our applications to take this function to be a polynomial , in which case @xmath7 is an element of the coordinate ring of @xmath1 , @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "an example variety @xmath1 and function @xmath7 is shown in figure  [ fig : frame ] .",
    "the objective of this paper is to construct and evaluate a scalar - valued function @xmath9 which is equal to @xmath7 on @xmath1 , but which is defined over all of @xmath10 , the convex hull of @xmath1 .",
    "obviously there are many ways to define such functions .",
    "to proceed , we single out two special possibilities for @xmath9 , defined by the formulas : @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary point in @xmath10 , @xmath14 is a probability distribution , and @xmath15 is an arbitrary positive integer .",
    "a simple consequence of carathodory s theorem is that @xmath15 is bounded above by the dimension of @xmath1 , @xmath16 @xcite .    the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 defined by ( [ eq : caraconvroof ] ) and ( [ eq : caraconcroof ] ) are called the _ convex roof _ and _ concave roof _ of @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we refer to the procedure of constructing @xmath17 or @xmath18 as _ roofing _ @xmath7 .",
    "one of our main objectives is to evaluate @xmath17 or @xmath18 at an arbitrary point @xmath19 .",
    "obviously this can be done by simply carrying out the optimisation in ( [ eq : caraconvroof ] ) and ( [ eq : caraconcroof ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , evaluating @xmath17 at a point @xmath20 according to ( [ eq : caraconvroof ] ) and ( [ eq : caraconcroof ] ) is , in general , very difficult .",
    "for this reason , in this section , we provide an alternative way to evaluate these functions .",
    "we shall spend a lot of time discussing properties of the _ graph _ of @xmath7 on @xmath1 , denoted @xmath21 , which is the subset of @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 associated with @xmath21 is the convex hull of the graph of @xmath7 , which is the subset of @xmath22 given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is a probability distribution , and we have invoked carathodory s theorem to bound the number of terms in the sum by @xmath27 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : convhull ] for an example of what @xmath28 looks like for the variety @xmath1 and function @xmath7 introduced in figure  [ fig : frame ] .    the connection between @xmath28 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 is provided by the following lemma .",
    "[ cor : roofhull ] the convex and concave roofs of @xmath7 are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the equality of ( [ eq : altconvroof ] ) and ( [ eq : caraconvroof ] ) ( respectively , ( [ eq : altconcroof ] ) and ( [ eq : caraconvroof ] ) ) follows immediately from the definition of ( [ eq : convepif ] ) .",
    "lemma  [ cor : roofhull ] shows us that the convex roof of @xmath7 is the `` lower boundary '' of the convex hull of the graph of @xmath7 . similarly , the concave roof @xmath18 is the `` upper boundary '' of @xmath28 .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath17 in figure  [ fig : roof ] .",
    "the convex and concave roofs of @xmath7 are distinguished from all other functions @xmath9 on @xmath10 equal to @xmath7 on @xmath1 by the following result .",
    "[ lem : uhlmanna3 ] the convex roof ( respectively , concave roof ) of @xmath7 is , pointwise , the largest convex ( respectively , smallest concave ) function equal to @xmath7 on @xmath1 .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the main result of this section : an alternative way to evaluate @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this result takes the form of a necessary condition which limits the space over which the infimum and supremum in ( [ eq : caraconvroof ] ) and ( [ eq : caraconcroof ] ) needs to be taken .",
    "to begin , we make use of the fundamental duality between convex sets and intersections of halfspaces to write @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is some bounded set , as an intersection in @xmath33 of a collection of halfspaces , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a halfspace , and @xmath36 is the set of all halfspaces containing @xmath37 . where obvious we abuse notation and write @xmath38 to refer to the hyperplane @xmath39 associated with a halfspace @xmath40 .",
    "a hyperplane @xmath41 in @xmath2 is said to be @xmath15-_tangent _ to a nonsingular variety ( or indeed any sufficiently well - behaved manifold ) @xmath42 at points @xmath43 if @xmath41 contains both the points @xmath43 and their associated tangent spaces @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 or @xmath46 then @xmath41 is said to be bitangent or tritangent to @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the set @xmath36 contains three types of halfspace .",
    "firstly , there are those halfspaces which completely contain @xmath37 and whose associated hyperplane does not contain any point of @xmath37 .",
    "secondly , there are those halfspaces whose associated hyperplane contains one or more points of @xmath37 .",
    "these halfspaces are said to _ support _",
    "@xmath37 . finally , of those halfspaces which support @xmath37 at some collection of points @xmath47",
    "there are those whose associated hyperplane is @xmath48-tangent to @xmath37 at some subset of @xmath48 points of @xmath49 ( because of the assumption of nonsingularity , @xmath37 has a well - defined tangent space at each point ) .",
    "one of our main results , for this subsection , is a necessary condition for the hyperplane @xmath41 associated with some halfspace @xmath50 to support @xmath37 :    [ thm : spanub ] let @xmath51 be a hyperplane that supports a nonsingular variety ( or manifold ) @xmath32 at @xmath15 points @xmath52 .",
    "the ( translate of an ) @xmath53-dimensional vector space defined by @xmath41 must contain , as subspaces , the vector spaces @xmath44 , @xmath54 and the vector space formed from the vectors @xmath55 , @xmath56 . in particular , if @xmath51 supports @xmath37 at @xmath47 , it must be @xmath15-tangent to @xmath37 at @xmath47 .",
    "a hyperplane @xmath51 which supports @xmath37 at @xmath15 points @xmath52 contains these points so , in particular , it must contain all the vectors @xmath55 , @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , if @xmath41 did not contain @xmath44 as a subspace , for all @xmath58 , then some part of @xmath41 would lie inside the convex hull of @xmath37 near some point @xmath59 , contradicting @xmath51 .",
    "the second statement is simply a restatement of the first .",
    "proposition  [ thm : spanub ] provides a necessary condition for a hyperplane @xmath51 to support @xmath37 . in general",
    "this condition is not sufficient as there exist hyperplanes @xmath60 which satisfy the condition of proposition  [ thm : spanub ] .",
    "the effect of this proposition is to identify a subset of @xmath61 such that the convex hull of @xmath37 can still be found by intersecting members of @xmath62 .",
    "we now specialise the results we have just obtained to describe the structure of @xmath28 .",
    "as demonstrated by corollary  [ cor : roofhull ] , the convex and concave roofs of a function @xmath7 are the top and bottom halves of the boundary of @xmath28 .",
    "it is useful to obtain a characterisation of this boundary .",
    "to do so , we make use of the observations above and a lemma of uhlmann @xcite to describe the nature of these two hypersurfaces .",
    "it turns out that the surfaces in @xmath22 defined by either @xmath17 or @xmath18 are comprised of a union of a family of polytopes ( convex hulls of finite sets of points ) which ,",
    "pairwise , have zero intersection . to see this .",
    "this does not entail any loss of generality as all statements about @xmath17 extend in an obvious way to @xmath18 .",
    "] , note that any point @xmath63 of @xmath17 may be written as a finite sum @xmath64 .",
    "we call this sum an",
    "_ optimal @xmath65-decomposition _ of @xmath13 for @xmath17 .",
    "( where the convexity or concavity is obvious we simply refer to this sum as an optimal decomposition . )",
    "a lemma of uhlmann ( lemma 3 , @xcite ) shows us that something stronger actually applies , namely that the polytope defined by the convex hull of the points @xmath66 also lies entirely within the surface defined by @xmath17 .",
    "the consequence of this observation is that the surface defined by @xmath17 ( which is one half of the boundary of @xmath28 ) is made completely from a ( pairwise disjoint ) union of polytopes .",
    "further , each of these polytopes @xmath67 is a piece of the hyperplane which supports @xmath21 at the extreme points @xmath66 ( because the polytope lives on the boundary of the convex set @xmath28 ) .",
    "the structure of @xmath17 is illustrated for the example of @xmath68 in figure  [ fig : roof ] , where , in this case , it may be seen that @xmath17 is comprised of line segments and one triangle .    for a given @xmath19 , we are interested in determining the polytope @xmath67 on the boundary of @xmath28 which contains @xmath69 .",
    "equivalently , given @xmath19 we are interested in determining an optimal @xmath15-decomposition for @xmath17 at @xmath13 .",
    "one way of approaching this problem is to simply search the entire space of all sequences of points @xmath66 which achieve the infimum in ( [ eq : caraconvroof ] ) and check to see if their convex hull contains @xmath69 .",
    "proposition  [ thm : spanub ] indicates that this is not necessary because we need only search through sequences of points @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 for which there exists an @xmath15-tangent hyperplane passing through them .",
    "this statement is the content of the following corollary .",
    "[ cor : mtang ] let @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 is an optimal @xmath15-decomposition for @xmath17 at @xmath13 then there is a hyperplane @xmath41 passing through @xmath75 which is @xmath15-tangent at @xmath75 .      in this subsection",
    "we utilise corollary  [ cor : mtang ] to provide an implicit representation for an optimal decomposition of a point @xmath19 for @xmath17 .",
    "we show that when @xmath7 is a polynomial an optimal decomposition for @xmath17 at a point @xmath19 may be found by simultaneously solving a set of polynomial equations . in principle",
    "this enables us to invoke the machinery of algebraic geometry , in particular grbner bases methods , to solve the problem @xcite .",
    "corollary  [ cor : mtang ] shows that to find an optimal decomposition for @xmath17 at a point @xmath19 we need only search over points @xmath47 for which there exists an @xmath15-tangent hyperplane @xmath41 passing through these points .",
    "if we were able to obtain an expression for the basis for the tangent space @xmath76 at @xmath59 then we could reduce this problem to establishing the linear dependence of a collection of vectors in the following way .",
    "consider the tangent space @xmath76 at a point @xmath77 .",
    "suppose we had a formula , in terms of the components of @xmath59 , for each the basis vectors @xmath78 of @xmath76 , where @xmath79 . using this formula we could rephrase proposition  [ thm : spanub ] as the statement that for an @xmath15-tangent hyperplane @xmath41 supporting @xmath1 at @xmath47 , the matrix @xmath80 whose",
    "rows are formed from the vectors @xmath78 and @xmath55 , @xmath57 must have rank less than or equal to @xmath81 .",
    "this condition can be imposed by requiring @xcite that all the @xmath82-submatrices of @xmath80 have zero determinant . if all the entries of @xmath80 were polynomials . ] in @xmath47 then this condition becomes the requirement that a set of polynomials vanish .    using the ingredients discussed in the previous paragraph we are now able to express an optimal decomposition for a point @xmath19 as the simultaneous solution to a set of polynomials .",
    "the key observation is that it is possible to take the components of the basis vectors @xmath83 for the tangent space @xmath84 of an algebraic variety @xmath1 ( embedded in affine space ) to be polynomials in the coordinate vector @xmath85 . to see this recall @xcite that the tangent space to @xmath1 , or the _ zariski tangent space _ ,",
    "is defined to be the null space of the matrix @xmath86 , where @xmath87 . because the entries of @xmath88 are polynomials in the components of @xmath89 ,",

    "( to see this , find the basis for the null space of @xmath88 via row reduction .",
    "the entries will be rational functions of @xmath91 . to get polynomial entries just clear denominators . )",
    "we now return to the matrix @xmath80 which we introduced in the previous two paragraphs .",

    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 , where we identify @xmath95 with @xmath96 , as well as @xmath97 rows consisting of the basis vectors @xmath78 , @xmath98 . there are @xmath99 @xmath100-submatrices of @xmath80 .",
    "we denote the determinants of each of these submatrices by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 runs over all the @xmath99 possible submatrices . in order for a hyperplane to be @xmath15-tangent to @xmath103",
    "we require that all of the polynomials @xmath101 simultaneously vanish . by adjoining the equations @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ( which ensure that @xmath59 lie in @xmath1 ) and the equations @xmath107 , @xmath108 ( which ensure that @xmath13 lies in the convex hull of @xmath59 ) we obtain a set of conditions for @xmath109 to be an optimal @xmath15-decomposition for @xmath19 .",
    "this discussion constitutes a proof of the following proposition .",
    "[ thm : optdec ] an optimal @xmath15-decomposition for @xmath19 consists of @xmath15 points @xmath110 and @xmath15 variables @xmath26 which satisfy the following equations : @xmath111    proposition  [ thm : optdec ] has two important consequences for the evaluation of convex roofs .",
    "the first is that it provides an _ implicit _ representation for the optimal decomposition of a point @xmath19 for @xmath17 .",
    "this is in contrast to standard procedure to calculate an optimal decomposition , i.e. , via direct minimisation of ( [ eq : caraconvroof ] ) . in general",
    "this minimisation must be performed numerically and , as a consequence , there is no guarantee that a calculated decomposition is optimal ( it could just be a local minima ) .",
    "the polynomials of proposition  [ thm : optdec ] therefore provide a _ certificate _ of optimality .",
    "the second consequence of proposition  [ thm : optdec ] is that the space required to search through to calculate an optimal decomposition is dramatically reduced . often , in practice",
    ", an infinite search space is replaced with a finite search space .    to illustrate proposition  [ thm : optdec ] we write out the equations that must be solved to find a bitangent plane for the example introduced in figure  [ fig : frame ] .",
    "these equations read @xmath112 by solving these equations we were able to calculate the convex hull and convex roof illustrated in figure  [ fig : convhull ] and figure  [ fig : roof ] .",
    "in this paper we are interested in calculating roofs for certain scalar - valued functions defined on the state - space of quantum systems .",
    "initially , it seems that this problem is unrelated to the results of the previous section because state - space ( a hilbert space ) has no obvious geometric character . in this section",
    "we show that in fact pure state - space for quantum systems of dimension @xmath113 may be represented by the common zero - loci of a collection of polynomial equations .",
    "this provides the first piece of information  the domain @xmath1 for the function @xmath7 we wish to roof  needed to apply the results of  [ sec : prelims ] to our problem .",
    "( we discuss the second piece of information , the construction of the function @xmath7 we wish to roof , in the next section . )",
    "we note that there are many papers dealing with generalisations of the bloch sphere construction for higher - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the generalisation we recall here seems to date from 1997 , where it was considered in detail in the papers of @xcite .",
    "the observation that this embedding of state - space into @xmath2 is a quadratic variety is , to the best of our knowledge , original .",
    "the bloch sphere representation for a rank-@xmath115 density operator density operator @xmath116 , where @xmath117 are the eigenvectors of @xmath118 , may be thought of as the state of an effective two - level system ( qubit ) whose states are `` logical zero '' @xmath119 and `` logical one '' @xmath120 . ]",
    "is a fundamental conceptual tool in quantum mechanics ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of the bloch sphere ) .",
    "the fact that the space of all rank-@xmath115 density operators corresponds to a geometrical object as simple as the sphere @xmath121 and its interior in @xmath122 has led to many discoveries .",
    "this is due , in part , to the fact that it is possible to employ geometric intuition when dealing with systems whose states or dynamics can be represented on the bloch sphere .",
    "it is therefore very desirable to consider generalisations of the bloch sphere to see if there is a simple geometrical object that represents the state - space for a @xmath113-level system .",
    "unfortunately there is no object which possesses quite the simplicity of the bloch sphere .",
    "however , as we argue , there is one natural way to generalise the bloch sphere construction which is useful when discussing certain aspects of rank-@xmath113 density operators .    in this section",
    "we discuss a generalisation of the bloch sphere representation for density operators of rank-@xmath113 , which we call the poincar sphere ( we choose this terminology in order to avoid confusion with the bloch sphere which specifically refers to @xmath121 ) .",
    "the first step in the poincar sphere construction is to choose an operator basis with respect to which an arbitrary rank-@xmath113 density operator can be expanded .",
    "we choose the set of traceless hermitian generators @xmath123 , @xmath124 for the group @xmath125 .",

    "further , this basis is orthonormal under the hilbert - schmidt inner product : @xmath141 ( in the following greek indices are assumed to run from @xmath142 to @xmath132 . )    using the operator basis ( [ eq : sulam1])-([eq : sulam3 ] ) we can obtain a geometric representation for the space of all pure states of a @xmath113-dimensional quantum system .",

    "is simply given by the convex hull of this quadratic variety , @xmath178 .",
    "to get an idea of what @xmath175 looks like as a subspace of @xmath176 consider the expression @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 are any two pure states .",

    "we see that widest angle @xmath186 between any two points in @xmath175 is given by @xmath187 , so that if @xmath13 represents a pure quantum state , @xmath188 can not , unless @xmath189 .      in the previous subsection we introduced a geometric representation for the convex set of all density operators for a @xmath113 dimensional quantum system . in order to do",
    "so we expanded an arbitrary density operator @xmath118 in terms of a specific operator basis , the generalised gellmann matrices . in this subsection",
    "we briefly summarise the analogous results for when we expand @xmath118 in terms of an arbitrary ( hermitian ) operator basis .",
    "our main motivation for investigating poincar sphere representations for @xmath118 with respect to different operator bases is to better study states @xmath118 of a multipartite system . because we are interested in situations when a pure - state density operator @xmath118 is a product state @xmath190 , it is desirable , in some cases , to expand @xmath118 in terms of an operator basis which makes this property manifest , such as the basis @xmath191 formed from the tensor product of two gellmann bases .",
    "if we expand a density operator @xmath118 in terms of an operator basis different from the gellmann matrices we find that the generalised poincar sphere so derived is different .",
    "it turns out however , that the new poincar sphere is related to the original sphere via an overall isometry . to see this we need to derive a more general geometric form of the pure state conditions ( [ eq : psalgcond ] ) . for clarity",
    "we limit ourselves to complete hermitian orthonormal operator bases @xmath192 , @xmath193 .    the geometric pure state conditions analogous to ( [ eq : vanfun ] ) and ( [ eq : psexcon ] ) follow from expanding the ( hermitian ) product @xmath194 in terms of the complete basis , @xmath195 where @xmath196 are the expansion coefficients .",
    "following the analysis detailed in the previous subsection we can write out the pure state conditions in terms of @xmath149 : @xmath197 where @xmath198 . the pure state conditions ( [ eq : psgencon1 ] ) , ( [ eq : psgencon2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : psgencon3 ] ) say that @xmath149 must be a vector in @xmath199 which lies in the the intersection of the hypersphere ( [ eq : psgencon2 ] ) with a hyperplane ( [ eq : psgencon1 ] ) and @xmath200 quadric surfaces ( [ eq : psgencon3 ] ) .",

    "say we wish to represent @xmath118 with respect to some other operator basis , i.e.write @xmath203 , and we want to know how the geometric pure state conditions for @xmath149 and @xmath204 are related .",
    "this relationship can be elucidated by making use of the formula @xmath205 . by substituting this formula into the geometric pure state conditions ( [ eq : psgencon1 ] ) , ( [ eq :",
    "psgencon2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : psgencon3 ] ) we find that @xmath204 must satisfy @xmath206 where @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "( when @xmath209 is the gellmann basis these conditions reduce to ( [ eq : vanfun ] ) and ( [ eq : psexcon ] ) . ) in this way we see that the generalised poincar representation is unique up to an isomorphism of varieties .",

    "in this section we briefly review the definitions and some results that have been obtained in the theory of entanglement .",
    "in particular we introduce a set of axioms for a function to be considered an entanglement measure .",

    "our problem , at its most elementary level , is to answer questions such as : given a pure state @xmath219 of @xmath212 , when is this state expressible as a tensor product @xmath190 ?",
    "more precisely , one of the general problems we are interested in is the following . given an arbitrary mixed state @xmath118 of a multipartite quantum system @xmath220 , when is @xmath118 expressible as a convex combination of tensor - product states : @xmath221 where @xmath222 are pure states ?",
    "this problem is fundamental in the theory of entanglement and has received a great deal of attention in recent times .",
    "this work has culminated in the development of several criteria to determine when a state can be written in the form ( [ eq : mpartysep ] ) .    deciding if a mixed state @xmath118 is expressible as in ( [ eq : mpartysep ] )",
    "is significantly complicated by the fact that there are many ways to write a mixed state as a convex combination of pure states .",
    "fortunately there is a recipe which can be utilised to relate all the different decompositions of @xmath118 in terms of convex mixtures of pure states @xcite . to describe this recipe we first write @xmath118 in terms of the decomposition latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq :",

    "it turns out that any other decomposition of @xmath118 can be found via the equation @xmath226 where @xmath227 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eofmin2 ] ) may take any integer value greater than or equal to the rank of @xmath118 .",
    "this is because @xmath118 may be realised from an ensemble consisting of arbitrarily many pure states . )",
    "the problem described in the previous paragraphs is known as the _ separability problem _  a state @xmath118 being _ separable _ if it is expressible as in ( [ eq : mpartysep ] ) , and _ entangled _ otherwise . by itself",
    "this is an interesting mathematical problem .",
    "however , there are deeper reasons for why we are interested in answering it .",
    "these stem from the fact that _ entanglement _ , the property possessed by entangled states , seems to be a fundamentally new kind of resource like free energy or information .",
    "motivated by this , researchers are interested in working out when a state contains some of this resource ( i.e.deciding when @xmath118 is not separable ) . ultimately , however , researchers are more interested in working out _ how much _ of this resource is present in a given state .    in this area of research , the theory of entanglement , a unified approach to answering questions such as the separability of a state @xmath118 and the measurement of the entanglement of @xmath118 has been developed .",
    "this approach is based on studying the properties of certain functions , called _ entanglement measures _ , on state - space which are zero for all separable states , and which are nonzero for all other states .    at the current time",
    "there are only hints that entanglement measures actually measure the resource character of entanglement .",
    "we ignore this problem for the time being , concentrating on the more basic problem of evaluating certain entanglement measures .",
    "what properties must a scalar - valued function @xmath228 possess in order for it to be described as an entanglement measure ?",
    "this problem has been widely studied in the physics literature and a partial consensus has been reached .    for bipartite quantum systems with state - space isomorphic to @xmath229 , with @xmath230 , it has been shown @xcite that entanglement measures are in bijective correspondence with unitarily invariant , concave ( and hence continuous ) real - valued functions on the space of density operators over @xmath231 .",
    "more precisely , consider any ( continuous ) real - valued function @xmath232 on the space @xmath233 of density operators @xmath118 on @xmath231 which satisfies :    1 .",

    "the functions @xmath246 are easily seen to be unitarily invariant and concave .",
    "the family @xmath246 has one further property , namely that they are zero for pure states @xmath118 .",
