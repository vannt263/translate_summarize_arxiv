    "one of the most remarkable examples of the failure of the independent  electron approximation is the existence of so  called mott  hubbard insulators .",
    "the early transition oxides like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 show an insulating behaviour , although they contain partially filled @xmath6 bands .",
    "the reason is the strong coulomb repulsion of the @xmath6 electrons , which hinders them from moving freely .",
    "a simple model to describe the situation is the hubbard hamiltonian with one electron per site @xcite :    @xmath7    electrons can hop from one site @xmath8 to another @xmath9 via the hopping ",
    "matrix element @xmath10 .",
    "whenever two electrons ( of opposite spins ) occupy the same site , they repel each other with an interaction energy @xmath11 .    to obtain insulating behaviour ( implying a vanishing dc conductivity at zero temperature ) an energy gap for charge excitations is required .",
    "the existence of a conductivity gap can be inferred from the spectral density of states @xmath12 .",
    "obviously , for large coulomb repulsion and half  filling there is a gap of order @xmath11 .",
    "the transition from a metallic ( @xmath13 ) to an insulating ( @xmath11 large ) state is still subject of intensive investigations @xcite . for general lattices",
    "( without special symmetry properties ) there is reason to believe that the transition takes place at a finite value @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model deals with one orbital per site and ignores any additional bands which might be present . as was first pointed out by zaanen , sawatzky and allen @xcite this is not sufficient for a classification of the transition metal oxides .",
    "the following hamiltonian represents a natural extension of the hubbard model by including one additional spin ",
    "orbital with creation operators @xmath15 for each site @xmath8 :    @xmath16    in the following we will refer sometimes to the additional orbital as a ligand orbital implying that it may belong to a ligand atom . note , that the on  site energy of the ligand orbitals has been set equal to zero .",
    "therefore the ligand orbitals are higher in energy than the @xmath17 orbitals ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the system is assumed to be quarter  filled , i.e. , with one electron ( or hole ) per site .",
    "zaanen _ et al_. @xcite employed a single  impurity approach to derive a phase diagram for the transition  metal compounds .",
    "thereby the transition ",
    "metal atoms are taken to be independent .",
    "this implies a neglect of the hopping term @xmath10 in ( [ extend ] ) .",
    "moreover , indirect hopping processes between the @xmath17 orbitals via the @xmath19 orbitals are excluded .",
    "the calculated band gaps in the density of states then approximately scale with the hybridization @xmath20 . beside the mott ",
    "hubbard regime , where the gap is proportional to @xmath11 , a second region with a gap proportional to @xmath21 was identified . for this phase the term charge ",
    "transfer insulator is used . as a consequence of the single ",
    "impurity approach a metallic state was predicted when the transition  metal level lies within the free electron band of the ligand host .",
    "in contrast , a hybridization gap may be obtained when taking into account coherence effects of the transition  metal atoms .",
    "nimkar _ et al_. @xcite and sarma and barman",
    "@xcite called the insulating phase due to a hybridization gap a covalent insulator and derived the corresponding region of the phase diagram .",
    "the special feature of a covalent insulator is , that it undergoes an insulator  to  metal transition with decreasing hybridization .",
    "the gap does not scale with @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath22 ( with ln a rare earth ion other than la ) and @xmath23 are believed to belong to this class @xcite .",
    "they can be driven into a metallic state without a symmetry lowering structural transition by varying pressure or temperature .",
    "if we do not neglect the hopping term @xmath10 in ( [ extend ] ) , we can also imagine the opposite taking place , i.e. , an insulator  to  metal transition with increasing hybridization .",
    "electrons hopping into ligand levels create holes in the hubbard system , which may move and contribute to the conductivity . a mechanism of this kind was recently proposed for the rare  earth compound @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such an insulator  to  metal transition due to `` self  doping '' would be an interesting new possibility for forming metals with low carrier concentration .",
    "moreover , like the mott  hubbard insulator , it can not be understood within an independent electron picture .    to investigate in more detail the influence of an additional band on the transport properties of a strongly correlated electron system we suggest the following model :    @xmath24    again",
    ", the system is assumed to be quarter  filled , i.e. , it has one electron per site .",
    "the coulomb repulsion is chosen to be greater than the critical value @xmath25 of the hubbard system .",
    "therefore we will call the model a self  doped mott system ( sms ) in the following . in comparison to the hamiltonian  ( [ extend ] )",
    "we have neglected the hopping @xmath26 between the ligand orbitals . for realistic situations",
    "this approximation is not justified , neither for rare ",
    "earth nor for transition  metal compounds .",
    "note , that in systems like @xmath0 the widths of the correlated and uncorrelated bands are equal ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ sms ] ) should be regarded as a basic model containing the necessary terms for the self  doping mechanism .",
    "moreover , whenever we have included the hopping term @xmath26 we found no change in the general behaviour .",
    "we will come back to this point later .    in this paper",
    "we report first results of an investigation of the system described by ( [ sms ] ) . in section  [ model ]",
    "we illustrate in a transparent way some model properties .",
    "we discuss exact solutions in the limit of zero bandwidth and of infinite hybridization .",
    "concerning the metal ",
    "insulator transition in the hubbard model two different situations have to be distinguished . in the case of a nested fermi surface the hubbard model at half filling",
    "is an insulator for any @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we investigate this case for the sms by means of an unrestricted hartree ",
    "fock approximation @xcite and present the results in section  [ nefer ] . additionally the one  dimensional case is studied by exactly diagonalizing a finite system .",
    "two early approaches have dominated the discussion about the mott ",
    "hubbard transition for general lattices without nesting : ( i ) the brinkman ",
    "rice approach @xcite , which can be formally derived by using slave boson methods @xcite , and ( ii ) the alloy analogy , which is contained in the first part of the well  known hubbard iii paper @xcite .",
    "we apply these approximation schemes to our model and present the results in section [ genla ] .",
    "finally , section  [ conclu ] contains a short summary and outlook .",
    "in the case of vanishing hybridization the sms reduces to a hubbard model with a separated ligand level . in the first column of fig .  [ spectral ]",
    "we sketch the corresponding density of states . for @xmath29 three different regions exist ( indicated by ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in that figure ) :    * mott  hubbard insulator : @xmath30 .",
    "when adding one electron to the system the lowest energy states contain an additional double occupied @xmath17 orbital .",
    "the gap is of order @xmath11 .",
    "* charge transfer insulator : @xmath31 . an additional electron avoids the coulomb repulsion felt in the @xmath17 subsystem and prefers to occupy the ligand orbital .",
    "the energy scale of the gap is set by @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ spectral ] , ( 3 ) ) . * due to the hopping term @xmath10 the lower and upper hubbard bands possess a finite bandwidth @xmath32 .",
    "the ground state of the sms contains occupied ligand orbitals if the gain of kinetic energy due to holes in the hubbard subsystem overcomes the transfer energy : @xmath33 . adding or removing one electron changes the energy only infinitesimally .",
    "the system is metallic ( fig .",
    "[ spectral ] , ( 4 ) ) .",
    "we turn now to the case of infinite hybridization . for @xmath34",
    "it is convenient to use a basis in which the hybridization term is diagonal . introducing :    @xmath35    we obtain for the hamiltonian ( [ sms ] ) :    @xmath36    with :    @xmath37    @xmath38    for @xmath39 the @xmath40 orbitals remain empty and we can restrict ourselves to the part @xmath41 .",
    "the sms reduces to a hubbard model with a hopping matrix @xmath42 and a coulomb repulsion @xmath43 .",
    "the result is easily understood .",
    "when the two orbitals at a given site hybridize strongly with each other , the eigenstates are given by the bonding @xmath44 and linear combinations .",
    "only the @xmath44 orbitals are populated to which the original @xmath17 orbitals contribute by one half . the coulomb repulsion felt by two electrons occupying one @xmath44 orbital",
    "is reduced to a quarter and the hopping between two @xmath44 orbitals is reduced to one half .",
    "the trivial but important observation is , that the coulomb repulsion is stronger reduced than the hopping .",
    "since only the relation between these two quantities is important , the sms describes for @xmath45 a metal and for @xmath46 an insulator ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this is indicated in the second column of fig .",
    "[ spectral ] by ( i ) and ( ii ) , respectively .    having discussed the extreme limits , two transitions seem to be possible when changing the hybridization @xmath20 from zero to infinity : for @xmath47 , @xmath48 a metal  to  insulator and for @xmath49 , @xmath50 an insulator  to  metal transition should take place with increasing @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the effective band width of the lower hubbard band .",
    "the two possibilities correspond to the aforementioned covalent insulator and a self  doped metallic state , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the second scenario is realized only if @xmath51 , i.e. , for a finite value of the critical coulomb repulsion @xmath25 in the corresponding hubbard model .    in order to gain better insight into the behaviour of the system for finite hybridization we have considered the zero bandwidth limit of the sms :    @xmath52    the hamiltonian is easily diagonalized , yielding the eigenvalues @xmath53 and eigenstates @xmath54 for @xmath55 electrons",
    "( @xmath56 ) . the @xmath17 density of states",
    "is given by :    @xmath57    here @xmath58 and the sum is only over one site .",

    "we can clearly identify the lower and upper hubbard peaks , as well as the peaks caused by adding one electron to the ligand orbital situated at @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) . due to the different effect of the hybridization on a singlet and a triplet state the splits up . as a result weight is pushed towards the lower hubbard peak .",
    "we stress that there is no direct weight transfer between the lower and upper hubbard peak .",
    "instead , the weight of the lower hubbard peak is always equal to unity . thus a simple self  doping picture which predicts a metallic state for an infinitesimal small hybridization @xmath20 does not hold true in that case .",
    "note , that the gap @xmath65 between the occupied and unoccupied part of the spectra continously decreases from @xmath66 to @xmath67 . when the full hamiltonian is used the peaks will mark the position of centers of bands .",
    "an overlap of the bands accompanied by an insulator  to  metal transition is expected , when the hybridization @xmath20 exceeds a critical value @xmath68 .",
    "we turn now to a treatment of the full hamiltonian ( [ sms ] ) . in this section we consider lattice symmetries and hopping matrices which lead to a nested fermi surface . the critical coulomb repulsion in the corresponding hubbard model vanishes .",

    "no insulator  to  metal transition takes place . in section  [ model",

    "therefore the obtained result confirms our prediction .",
    "as mentioned before , in the limit @xmath96 the system is always insulating .",
    "this finding implies a metal  to  insulator transition due to the opening of a hybridization gap in a certain parameter regime .",
    "we have identified a regime with @xmath97 and one with a finite critical value of the hybridization for the transition to an insulator .",
    "details will be presented elsewhere .",
    "here we characterize the two regimes only roughly by @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively ( @xmath100 ) .      in one spatial dimension the critical coulomb repulsion @xmath25 of the hubbard model with nearest neighbour hopping vanishes .",
    "the model should be insulating for all values of @xmath11 and @xmath20 ( @xmath94 ) . extending the hamiltonian ( [ sms ] ) to ( [ extend ] ) , i.e. , including a hopping term between different @xmath19 orbitals ,",
    "does not change the result qualitatively . in the limit @xmath96 the hamiltonian ( [ extend ] ) reduces to a single band hubbard model with a coulomb repulsion @xmath43 and hopping matrix elements @xmath101 .",

    "there is clearly a gap between the occupied and unoccupied part of the spectrum .",
    "the energy regime without weight is much larger than the typical distance between the poles . to summarize ,",
    "the lanczos calculations predict an insulator for the extended model @xmath109 in one spatial dimension . thus in the extended model the self - doping transition is restricted to a limited parameter regime .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the one of the sms .",

    "we restrict ourselves to a paramagnetic ground state .",
    "nevertheless correlation effects are included and both approximations predict a finite critical coulomb repulsion for the mott  hubbard transition .",
    "the restriction to a paramagnetic ground state does not allow the resolution of details of the underlying lattice symmetry .",
    "the results are therefore interpreted as the behaviour of the sms on a general lattice .",
    "we have excluded here the case of a nested fermi surface .",
    "again it suffices to specify @xmath77 . in the slave  boson approach we will use a rectangular form as before and in the alloy analogy we will choose an elliptical one :    @xmath110      in the slave  boson approach four bosonic fields are introduced with creation operators @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "the number of different approximation schemes for investigating the mott - hubbard transition for finite coulomb repulsion is rather limited . to explore the possibility of a self  doping transition one must be able to deal with the difficult parameter regime @xmath177 .",
    "moreover , in addition to the many  body coulomb term also the hybridization term has to be treated .",
    "the approximations applied here do not contradict the existence of an insulator  to  metal transition with increasing @xmath20 in a restrictive parameter space for @xmath11 . at present",
    "it is not clear which of the findings are due to a particular approximation made , i.e. , slave  boson mean  field or alloy analogy and which ones are independent of it . to resolve this problem",
