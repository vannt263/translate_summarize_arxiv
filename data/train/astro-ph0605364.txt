    "binary systems offer the only practical opportunity to measure accurate stellar masses , and represent a powerful test of evolutionary models and star formation theories .",
    "these last aspects are particularly important for stars at the bottom of the main sequence and brown dwarfs ( bds ) , whose physical parameters and formation mechanism are not well known .",
    "significant attention has recently been concentrated on binaries among ultracool dwarfs ( spectral types later than m6 ) both in the field ( @xcite ; @xcite , 2003 ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2005 ; @xcite ) and in nearby young open clusters and associations ( @xcite , 2000 , 2003 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys demonstrate that wide binary systems ( semi - major axis @xmath0 15  au ) are very rare amongst ultracool dwarfs , with a frequency below 1% , while tighter binaries ( semi - major axis @xmath1 15  au ) occurs in @xmath015% of them .",
    "this well defined cutoff is not caused by disruptions during galactic dynamical encounters , which only become effective at significantly wider separations @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation lies in the ejection model @xcite for brown dwarf formation , which describes them as failed stellar embryos , ejected from their parent gas core before they have time to accrete a larger mass .",
    "wide binaries are not expected to survive such an ejection , and the numerical simulations of this process suggest that it only produces close binaries ( separation @xmath2 10  au ; @xcite ) , in rough agreement with the observations . more recently however , a growing number of wide binaries ( separation @xmath0 30  au ) has been detected @xcite , suggesting that at least some vlm stars and bds form through another process .",
    "some of these apparent binaries , however , could be unresolved higher multiplicity systems , with a correspondingly higher total mass and binding energy . ascertaining how many of them there are is clearly important .    in this letter",
    ", we present adaptive optics observations of one such system , lp  714 - 37 @xcite , prompted in part by its apparently overluminous secondary .",
    "the new images do resolve that secondary into a tighter pair , and demonstrate that the system contains three vlm stars . sec .  2 presents the observations and the data reduction , while sec .",
    "3 . discusses the results in the context of the binary properties of wide vlm stars and bds in general , and of the formation of lp  714 - 37 in particular .",
    "we observed lp  714 - 37 at the 3.6-meter canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on 2005 october 13@xmath3 , using the cfht adaptive optics bonnette ( aob ) and the kir infrared camera .",
    "the aob , also called pueo after the sharp - visioned hawaiian owl , is a general - purpose adaptive optics ( ao ) system based on f. roddier s curvature concept @xcite .",
    "it is mounted at the telescope f/8 cassegrain focus , and cameras or other instruments are then attached to it @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric turbulence is analysed by a 19-element wavefront curvature sensor and the correction applied by a 19-electrode bimorph mirror .",
    "modal control and continuous mode gain optimization @xcite maximize the quality of the ao correction for the current atmospheric turbulence and guide star magnitude , and produced well corrected images for the faint lp  714 - 37 system ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) . for our observations",
    "a dichroic mirror diverted the visible light to the wavefront sensor while the kir science camera @xcite recorded infrared photons .",
    "the kir plate scale is 0035 per pixel , for a total field size of @xmath6 .",
    "we observed lp  714 - 37 through a k@xmath7 filter , and obtained series of five 30s exposures at each of five dither positions .",
    "the raw images were median combined to produce sky frames , which were then subtracted from the raw data .",
    "subsequent reduction steps included flat - fielding , flagging of the bad pixels , and finally shift - and - add combinations of the corrected frames into one final image ( fig .",
    "[ aoimage ] ) with a 12.5  min total exposure time .",
    "analysis of this image with sextractor @xcite produced the relative astrometry and relative photometry summarized in table  [ tab_oa ] .",
    "the proper motion of the system is @xmath8  =  @xmath9117  mas / yr and @xmath10  =  @xmath9382  mas / yr @xcite , and it has moved by 1.95  between the epoch of the denis image ( 2000.0 ) and our cfht observation .",
    "figure  [ fig_pm ] shows no background star at the position of the system in the denis and 2mass k images , demonstrating that the system is a physical triple .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically classified component  a as m5.5 , with an estimated absolute magnitude of @xmath11 .",
    "the relative photometry listed in table  [ tab_oa ] therefore provides estimates of @xmath12 for lp  714 - 37b and @xmath13 for lp  714 - 37c .",
    "we note that the difference between the denis - k , 2mass - k and k@xmath7 photometry is very small @xcite , and completely negligible for the purpose of the present paper . adding the flux of the three components , the absolute k - band magnitude of the system is @xmath14  =  8.5 , which combines with the denis magnitude ( @xmath15 ) to give a photometric distance of 18.9@xmath162.6  pc . at this updated distance the projected separations between b and c , and a and the bc barycenter , are respectively of 6.8 and 36.1  au .",
    "we estimate approximate spectral types for components b and c from their absolute k - band magnitude ( which itself scales back to the spectral type of a ) . a linear least - square fit to the absolute magnitudes and spectral types relation of 35  single m5.0-m9.5 dwarfs ( fig .",
    "[ mkvsspt ] ) , gives the following relation :      where spt is the spectral subtype , 5.0 for spectral type m5.0 and 9.5 for spectral type m9.5 .",
    "applying this relation results in estimated spectral types of m8.0@xmath160.5 and m8.5@xmath160.5 for component b and c , respectively .",
    "the 5  gyr k - band mass - luminosity relation of @xcite results in a mass 0.08@xmath160.01  m@xmath18 for component c. all three components have estimated masses close to the hydrogen - burning limit @xcite , and the total mass of lp  714 - 37 is @xmath190.28  m@xmath18 .",
    "table  [ parameters ] presents a summary of the derived physical parameters of the system .",
    "ejection models @xcite suggest that ( most ) brown dwarfs form through the premature removal of pre - stellar cores from their parental molecular clouds by dynamical interactions .",
    "these models qualitatively predict that the binary brown dwarf systems that do exist must be close ( separation @xmath2 10  au ) , since the small binding energy of wide bd binaries leaves them vulnerable to disruption .",
    "more recent simulations @xcite do produce some wide bd binary systems , when two unrelated objects are simultaneously ejected in the same direction .",
    "this mechanism however needs high density environments to work .",
    "it could thus not possibly form the wide binaries known in tw  hya , cha  i , and upper  sco @xcite .",
    "a caveat , however , is that some apparent binaries might be unresolved triple or higher order multiple systems , whose additional components could boost the binding energy of the systems enough to allow them to survive ejection .",
    "@xcite found that the minimum escape velocity in their sample of 34 vlm binaries is 3.8  km  s@xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ vesc ] ) .",
    "the escape velocity of lp  714 - 37 a and b at a 33  au semi - major - axis would be @xmath21  km  s@xmath20 , significantly under that limit .",
    "accounting for the additional c component however increases the escape velocity of the system to 4.4  km  s@xmath20 .",
    "this is significantly above the 3.8  km  s@xmath20 @xcite empirical lower limit , and figure  [ vesc ] actually has a close analog of lp  714 - 37 : gj  1245abc .",
    "lp  714 - 37 therefore demonstrates that some wide apparent vlm binaries are actually higher order multiple systems with @xmath22  @xmath23  km  s@xmath20 and no longer contradict the ejection scenario for brown dwarf formation .",
    "the wider vlm binaries identified by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite however can not be brought over @xmath24  @xmath23  km  s@xmath20 for any realistic number of components .",
    "this suggests that other formation channels must exist , but a high resolution search for additional components among wide vlm binaries such as cfht - pl-18 @xcite , denis 0551 - 44 @xcite , and denis 2200@xmath93038 @xcite is clearly important .",
