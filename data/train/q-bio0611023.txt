    "biological evolution presents many problems concerning interacting multi - entity systems far from equilibrium that are well suited for methods from nonequilibrium statistical physics @xcite . among these are questions concerning the dynamics of the emergence and extinction of species on macroevolutionary timescales @xcite .",
    "traditionally it has been common to treat ecological and evolutionary processes on very different timescales . however , it has recently been realized that evolution often can take place on short timescales , comparable to those of ecological processes @xcite . a well - known example of very rapid evolution is provided by the cichlid fishes of east africa @xcite .",
    "several models have therefore been proposed that , while spanning disparate scales of temporal and taxonomic resolution , consider the complex problem of coevolution of species in a fitness landscape that constantly changes with the composition of the community .",
    "early contributions were simulations of parapatric and sympatric speciation @xcite and the coupled @xmath3 model with population dynamics @xcite .",
    "more recent work includes the webworld model @xcite , the tangled - nature model @xcite and simplified versions of the latter @xcite , as well as network models @xcite .",
    "recently , large individual - based simulations have also been performed of parapatric and sympatric speciation @xcite and of adaptive radiation @xcite .",
    "many of the models discussed above are deliberately quite simple , aiming to elucidate universal features that are largely independent of the finer details of the ecological interactions and the evolutionary mechanisms .",
    "such features may include lifetime distributions for species and communities , as well as other aspects of extinction statistics , statistical properties of fluctuations in diversity and population sizes , and the structure and dynamics of food webs that develop and change with time .",
    "in the present paper we continue our study of a simplified version of the tangled - nature model . in the early studies of this individual - based model of coevolution @xcite ,",
    "the interspecies interactions , which are described by an interaction matrix @xmath4 @xcite , were random and could produce any combination of pair interactions : favorable - favorable , deleterious - deleterious , or favorable - deleterious . under those conditions",
    "the model was found to evolve through a sequence of quasi - stable communities , in which all species interact with mutually favorable interactions , i.e. , mutualistic or symbiotic communities .",
    "for that reason we shall hereafter refer to that version of the model as _ the mutualistic model_. here we instead concentrate on a version that specifically describes the evolution of predator - prey communities .",
    "this restriction is enforced by means of an antisymmetric interaction matrix , so that an interaction that is favorable for one member of a pair is deleterious for the other , and _",
    "vice versa_. many aspects of the dynamics of this predator - prey model are similar to the mutualistic model , such as approximate @xmath0 noise in species diversity and population sizes , and power - law distributions of the durations of communities and the lifetimes of species . however , some of the power - law exponents are different , and , most importantly , the predator - prey model produces communities that take the form of simple food webs .",
    "it also shares with the mutualistic model the property that mean population sizes and stability properties of fixed - point communities can be calculated exactly in the absence of mutations .",
    "comparisons of some aspects of the predator - prey model ( with a much smaller number of potential species than used here ) to those of the mutualistic model have been presented in refs .",
    "the focus of the present paper is a much more detailed discussion of the dynamics and the structure of the resulting food webs ( including comparison with real food webs ) for the predator - prey model with a large number of potential species . for this purpose",
    "we use both exact linear - stability analysis and large - scale kinetic monte carlo simulations .",
    "in particular we wish to study the fluctuations in the statistically stationary state that develops for long times .",
    "a motivation is the hope that understanding of these stationary - state fluctuations can provide information about the system s sensitivity to external perturbations in a way analogous to a fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite .",

    "in addition , the growth of real food webs involve a number of mechanisms , besides just evolution and local population dynamics .",
    "most notably , immigration plays an important role in the occurrence of new members of a spatially localized community .",
    "however , due to the large differences between parent species and mutants in the current model , our evolution mechanism may also been seen as covering immigration .",
    "we also note that the simulated communities have significantly smaller diversities , connectances , linkage densities , and population sizes than the real communities , so that our comparisons had to rely heavily on scaling arguments",
    ". it would therefore be desirable in future studies to increase the connectance , number of potential species , and resource size to bring the results closer to the realistic range .",
    "in this paper we have studied in detail an individual - based predator - prey model of biological coevolution , based on the simplified version of the tangled - nature model @xcite that was introduced in ref .",
    "selection is provided by a population - dynamics model in which the reproduction probability of an individual of a particular species depends nonlinearly on the amount of external resources and on the population densities of all other species resident in the community .",
    "new species appear in the community through point mutations in a genome consisting of a string of @xmath5 bits .    in the mutation - free limit",
    ", the mean fixed - point population sizes and stability properties of any @xmath53-species community can be obtained exactly by linear stability analysis . while the universal competition effect that enables this analytical treatment is not very realistic",
    ", the exact solutions make the model ideal as a benchmark for more realistic , but also more complicated , models . a preliminary discussion of two more realistic models is found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the simulations presented here , we used @xmath105 for a total of @xmath191 potential species .",
    "in order to study the statistically stationary properties of the model , we performed long kinetic monte carlo simulations over @xmath104 generations . by studying the stationary fluctuations we hope in the future to gain an understanding of the the system s sensitivity to external perturbations in a way analogous to the fluctuation - dissipation relations of equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , many of the statistical properties of this model are similar to those of the related , mutualistic model studied in refs .  @xcite . these include approximate @xmath0 noise in power spectra ( psds ) of diversity and population sizes ( @xmath123 with @xmath192 ) , and power - law distributions for the lifetimes of individual species , as well as of the durations of evolutionarily quiet periods , corresponding to qss communities . however , in contrast to the mutualistic model , the power - law exponents for the species lifetimes and qss durations are different : @xmath125 with @xmath126 for the former ( consistent with a stochastic branching process @xcite ) and @xmath134 with @xmath193 for the latter . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was speculated that the exponent values @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 are consistent with predictions for a zero - dimensional extremal - dynamics model @xcite .",
    "however , this speculation is not consistent with the presumably more accurate estimate for @xmath197 presented here , and it seems advisable to be rather skeptical about any mapping of the current model onto a simple statistical - mechanical extremal - dynamics model .",
    "it is probably more fruitful to consider why @xmath198 and @xmath199 are different for the current predator - prey model , while they coincide for the corresponding mutualistic model . here",
    "we believe the answer lies in the different community structures in the two models . while communities in the mutualistic model are tightly knit with all positive interactions ( see fig .",
    "10 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the communities in the present predator - prey model take the form of simple food webs , which are much more resilient toward the loss of a single or a few species . in this sense , this predator - prey model is in much better agreement with real food webs than the mutualistic model @xcite .",
    "our comparisons of the structure of the communities generated by our model with real food webs show both similarities and differences .",
    "a difficulty with such comparisons is the large differences in diversity and linkage density between the simulated and real webs , which necessitated heavy use of scaling arguments in the quantitative comparisons . for comparison of detailed community properties , simulations of models with higher diversity and connectance",
    "are therefore desirable in the future .",
    "nevertheless , our model presents a synthesis of long - term evolutionary dynamics and food - web like communities within an individual - based framework of integrated population dynamics and evolution , that should provide a sound basis for more refined models in the future .",
