    "the uncertainty relations , that express the inability to simultaneously measure the states of two non - commuting observables , form the cornerstone of quantum physics . for any pair of operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in standard form @xcite , they are stated as , @xmath2|\\psi \\rangle \\label{stdur}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the dispersions in @xmath0 and @xmath1 and @xmath5 $ ] is the commutator . in recent years",
    ", there has been a revival of interest in the uncertainty relations reformulated from the stand point of information theory , called the entropic uncertainty relations ( eur ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , the position - momentum uncertainty relation is formulated as follows ; given an eigenstate of a quantum system , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in configuration and momentum space representations , and if @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent their information entropies , then the entropic uncertainty relations can be written down as , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lower bound to the entropic sum or eur . here , the information entropy is defined as , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability density .",
    "the information entropy is a measure of the spreading or localisation of the given eigenstate .",
    "apart from its intrinsic value , the reformulation also seeks to address some of the shortcomings in the standard statement of the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "it also quantifies the uncertainty more accurately than the standard statement based on dispersions @xcite .",
    "in particular , a good amount of work has focussed on obtaining the lower bounds @xmath11 in general and we mention the result due to bialynicki - birula and mycielski @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dimensionality of the system .",
    "inspired by this general result , several authors have focussed on obtaining the lower bounds for eur of quantum systems whose classical limit is integrable , like the particle in an infinite well @xcite , harmonic oscillator and hydrogen atom in one and higher dimensions @xcite , power - law wavepackets @xcite and oscillating circular membrane @xcite .",
    "apart from the lower bounds , the values of eur as a function of quantum numbers has been analysed in detail in these series of papers . recently , dehesa et .",
    "al . have shown that for the one - dimensional power - law potentials of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a positive integer , in the region of highly excited states , the entropic sum goes as @xmath18 for all @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the single - particle probability density @xmath19 is also the quantity of fundamental interest in the density functional theory and hence its characterisation using information entropy as a measure for spreading has assumed special interest .",
    "in fact , treating atomic and molecular entropic sum was considered by gadre @xcite and he derived an approximate expression for the entropic sum within the thomas - fermi framework for neutral atoms .",
    "now it is known from several empirical studies for atomic , molecular and nuclear distributions that the entropic sum can be modelled as @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants and @xmath23 is number of electrons or nucleons , as the case maybe .",
    "the functional form given above seems to be fairly universal for many - fermions in some mean interactions @xcite .",
    "thus , one branch of the work on eur has focussed on quantum systems in the classically integrable limit whose eigenstates are analytically known .",
    "the other complementary branch has explored the complex atomic and molecular systems using a combination of approximate analytical and empirical methods . in these cases ,",
    "the eurs have been obtained as a function of increasing quantum numbers . however ,",
    "simple and chaotic model systems that bridge this divide between the purely integrable and the complex many - body systems have not yet been considered .",
    "the main reason seems to be that , as yet , no straightforward analytical technique is available to determine their eigenstates .",
    "thus , the main purpose of this article is to show that using adiabatic technique approximate eigenstates can be constructed and further that the entropic sums can also be estimated .",
    "in contrast to earlier works , we study the eur as a function of the nonlinearity parameter in the system .",
    "thus , we hope to understand the effect of nonlinearity using information theoretic measures .    in general ,",
    "the non - integrable hamiltonian systems are generic rather than an exception and model realistic physical systems .",
    "their phase space presents a mixture of regular and irregular trajectories , whose properties change with a parameter .",
    "the evolution of the probability density as a function of the parameter reflects the influence of these classical objects .",
    "thus it is important to look at the eur upon variation of the nonlinearity parameter .",
    "note that scale invariance of entropic sums leads to eurs that are independent of scaling parameters in an integrable system .",
    "but , in a non - integrable system , the entropic sums could depend on the nonlinearity parameter .",
    "in this work , we will consider the model hamiltonian , @xmath24 whose potential is displayed in fig . [ potential ] and",
    "@xmath25 are the parameters .",
    "the system is integrable for @xmath26 and corresponds to two - dimensional harmonic oscillator whose asymptotic ( large quantum number ) entropic sum was recently derived @xcite . for a choice of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , the system displays classical chaos for energy @xmath29 @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "the potential develops channels , as seen in the figure.,height=188 ]    the coupled oscillators are popular as models of chaos since they qualitatively mimic the complex dynamics in problems like the hydrogen atom in strong fields and generalised van der waals potential @xcite . for a generic chaotic system ,",
    "most of its eigenstates could be thought of as random waves except for a small sub - set of regular states that are influenced by the nature of local classical dynamics . hence in this work",
    ", we will only focus attention , for most part , on the ground state and , briefly , on the regular states . we stress that even though the system is chaotic , we study only those eigenstates that are associated locally with regular classical structures .",
    "ground state is pre - eminent because previous studies have shown that the ground state saturates the eur inequality in some systems ( e.g. harmonic oscillator ) and often in complex systems , the focus is on the ground state properties .",
    "next , we obtain the ground state entropies , as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "in the context of two degrees of freedom systems , if the frequency of oscillations between both the degrees of freedom differ vastly , then such a classical system becomes an ideal candidate for the adiabatic treatment .",
    "this is the well known born - oppenheimer approximation in atomic physics @xcite .",
    "the approach is to average over the faster degree of freedom and incorporate it into the hamiltonian for the slower degree of freedom . in this adiabatic approach ,",

    "the adiabatic theory based approach presented here is not without demerits . strictly speaking ,",
    "the adiabatic effects take over when there is clear separation in the time - scales of motion in the two modes that constitute the system .",
    "thus , in the case of hamiltonian in eq .",
