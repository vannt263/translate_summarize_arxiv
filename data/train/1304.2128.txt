    "as a powerful tool of understanding a variety of strongly coupled condensed matter systems , ads / cmt has been entering an era from building purely theoretical models with highly symmetric configuration to modelling more realistic condensed matter system with less symmetry . in particular , instead of working within the probe limit , very recently the authors in @xcite and @xcite have constructed some spatially inhomogeneous but periodic gravitational backgrounds by fully solving the coupled partial differential equations numerically with the einstein - deturck method .",
    "such gravitational backgrounds , by holography , correspond to the boundary systems in the presence of a lattice , a key ingredient in the condensed matter systems .",
    "thus with such gravitational backgrounds , one can explore various lattice effects in the holographic investigation of condensed matter systems .",
    "actually for the transport coefficients such as optical conductivity and thermoelectric conductivity , it has been shown that not only does the presence of a lattice result in the drude peak at low frequencies but also induces a new intermediate scaling regime in which a robust power law behavior is found with respect to the frequency@xcite .",
    "remarkably such a result is in striking agreement with the experiments on the cuprates , including the superconducting phase@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how such a holographic lattice affects the fermi surface by putting the dirac field in such bulk gravitational backgrounds . to achieve this , in the next section",
    "we first build up the holographic framework to extract the spectral function for fermions living on the boundary by solving the bulk dirac equation in periodic backgrounds .",
    "then we shall present a numerical construction of two kinds of ultra cold holographic lattices using the einstein - deturck method in section iii .",
    "after that , the numerical results for the fermi surface in the presence of such holographic lattices are detailed in section iv .",
    "we shall conclude with some discussions as well as further directions in the final section .",
    "start from the bulk action for a dirac field with mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath1 @xmath2    in the static background as general as @xmath3    here @xmath4 with @xmath5 a set of orthogonal normal vector bases and @xmath6 gamma matrices .",
    "in addition , @xmath7 is the covariant derivative , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] , and @xmath10 are the spin connection 1-forms given by @xmath11    with the following orthogonal normal vector bases @xmath12 the non - vanishing components of spin connections can be calculated as follows @xmath13    thus the dirac equation @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 to proceed , let us first make a transformation @xmath16 . then the above equation turns out to be @xmath17 next expanding @xmath18 as @xmath19 , one can have @xmath20 where we have denoted @xmath21 now if we choose our gamma matrices as @xmath22 and split the 4-component spinor into two 2-component spinors as @xmath23 , then the dirac equation becomes @xmath24 note that this is a coupled equation between @xmath25 and @xmath26 as opposed to the case in @xcite , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are decoupled .",
    "furthermore , by the decomposition @xmath29 with @xmath30 , the dirac equation ( [ diracef1f2 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33    suppose our background field is periodic along the @xmath34 direction with the periodicity @xmath35 .",
    "then by the bloch theorem , the solution to our dirac equation can always be expanded as follows @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "below we will restrict ourselves to the following periodic background , i.e. , @xmath38^{2 } + q_{yy}(x , z)dy^{2}\\},\\nonumber\\\\ a&=&(1-z)\\psi(x , z)dt.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 with the other variables regular from the horizon @xmath40 all the way to the conformal boundary @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , we require at the horizon @xmath42 and at the conformal boundary @xmath43 hence such a geometry asymptotes ads with the curvature radius @xmath44 and the temperature given by @xmath45    with the above background ansatz , our dirac equation gives rise to @xmath46 at the horizon . in order to obtain the retarded green function on the boundary by holography , the independent ingoing boundary condition should be imposed at the horizon , i.e. , @xmath47 for each @xmath48 and @xmath49 with the others turned off . on the other hand ,",
    "near the ads boundary , our dirac equation reduces to @xmath50 hence the solution can be asymptotically expanded near the ads boundary as @xmath51 holography tells us that the retarded green function can be obtained by the following relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the asymptotic expansion coefficients in ( [ boundarybehaviour ] ) of the solution to the dirac equation evolving from the ingoing boundary condition with the only @xmath55 mode turned on .    in what follows , for simplicity but without loss of generality",
    ", we shall work solely with the case of @xmath56 .",
    "a holographic lattice background can be constructed in at least two ways .",
    "one way is to introduce a neutral scalar field with the periodic boundary conditions along the spatial direction .",
    "we would like to refer to this kind of holographic lattice as the scalar lattice .",
    "the other kind of holographic lattice is induced directly by a periodic chemical potential to the gauge field on the boundary , which is referred to as the ionic lattice .",
    "this ionic lattice has been discussed earlier but almost always treated perturbatively in @xcite . in @xcite it was treated exactly without the scalar field . both of these two kinds of holographic lattice can be numerically constructed by the einstein - deturck method , which has been detailed in @xcite . in order to see the lattice effect on the fermi surface",
    ", we will follow the same route to construct these two kinds of holographic lattice backgrounds with a rather cold temperature .      to construct an ultra cold scalar lattice ,",
    "let us consider the following gravitational action including a maxwell field and a neutral scalar field , i.e. , @xmath57,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the ads radius as before , and @xmath59 is the mass of the scalar field . in what follows , we shall set @xmath44 and @xmath60 .",
    "then the equations of motion can be derived from the above action as @xmath61 now with the ansatz in eq.([metricconcrete ] ) for our holographic lattice , the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field is @xmath62\\ ] ] near the ads boundary .",
    "furthermore , the periodic structure can actually be induced by setting the source @xmath63 and keeping the chemical potential fixed as @xmath64    for our purpose we would like to construct an ultra cold lattice whose temperature is controlled by the parameter @xmath65 in eq.([temperature0 ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved by solving the coupled einstein - maxwell - scalar equations numerically using the einstein - deturck method .",
    "our numerical method is changing the partial differential equations into non - linear algebraic equations by the standard pseudospectral collocation approximation , and then solving them by employing a newton - raphson method .",
    "as an example , we show a solution to these equations in fig.[scalar ] with @xmath66 , which corresponds to a lattice with @xmath67 .",
    "note that different from the scalar field whose period is given by @xmath68 , the corresponding solutions of all the components of the metric as well as the gauge field have a period of @xmath69 along the @xmath34 direction , which comes essentially from the fact that in our first equation of motion the stress tensor is quadratic in the scalar field @xmath70 . since the scalar field does not appear in the dirac equation",
    ", we claim that the lattice constant that the probe dirac field feel is @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath71 in eq.([bloch ] ) is given by @xmath72 .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that during the course of numerical analysis the lower the temperature is , the harder monitoring the accuracy is . in order to guarantee the convergence of our method at the given temperature",
    ", we are required to demonstrate the decaying tendency of the charge discrepancy @xmath73 which is defined as @xmath74 with @xmath75 the charge on the boundary when the number of grid points takes @xmath76 . as shown in in fig.[tendency ] , such a decay is exponential , implying our results are exponential convergence with the increasing of the grid points .",
    "moreover , we have also checked the behavior of the deturck vector field @xmath77 which is defined in @xcite and found that for our solution @xmath78 is smaller than @xmath79 , ensuring that our numerics is leading to an einstein solution rather than a ricci soliton .      compared to the scalar lattice ,",
    "the ionic lattice can be generated simply by turning off the scalar field in ( [ gactioncold ] ) and imposing the spatially varying boundary condition for the chemical potential as @xmath80.\\ ] ] as an example , we illustrate a solution of @xmath81 and @xmath82 in fig.[chemical ] with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , which corresponds to @xmath86 .",
    "we stress that this type of solutions are different from those for the scalar lattice .",
    "namely the chemical potential is periodic rather than a constant in the scalar lattice . as a result , the boundary charge density in the ionic lattice",
    "is expected to vary more dramatically than that in the scalar lattice .",
    "this can easily be seen in our plot for the charge density in fig.[chemical ] . in this sense",
    ", one will also expect that the effect onto the fermi surface due to the ionic lattice should be much stronger than that due to the scalar lattice .",
    "we shall show in the subsequent section that this is actually the case .",
    "the existence of fermi surfaces for holographic fermionic liquids has been shown in various circumstances .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a recent review . in this paper",
    "we focus on reporting the following two new results relevant to the fermi surface when a lattice is introduced for the gravitational background .",
    "one is the shape of fermi surface . in general",
    "one expects that the shape of fermi surface is not circular any more since the rotation symmetry is broken in the presence of the lattice along the @xmath34 direction . but how the fermi surface would change appears obscure since the dirac equation becomes very complicated in this case . even in the case in which the lattice effect can be treated by conventional condensed matter approach",
    ", there is no some kind of universal result on the shape of fermi surface .",
    "instead the shape will depend on the specific behavior of periodic potential .",
    "nevertheless to our surprise , our numerical analysis gives us a very simple and elegant answer to this issue . that is , when our holographic fermi surface is located within the first brillouin zone , the shape is always an ellipse irrespective of the specific value of parameters in question .",
    "the other is the emergence of band gap at the intersection of the fermi surface with the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "this phenomenon coincides perfectly with the familiar lattice effect as one expects .",
    "now let us demonstrate our numerical results in detail .",
    "to proceed , we would like to remark on how to identify the fermi surface in our current setting .",
    "note that we are working with holographic fermionic liquid in the presence of lattice at very low but non - zero temperature , where the fermi surface is somewhat ill defined , because the concept of fermi surface can only be defined at zero temperature with translation symmetry unbroken .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the arpes experiment is actually blind to the lattice by smearing it into a continuum .",
    "the measured spectral function can be captured by the imaginary part of diagonal components of retarded green function , namely @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , taking into account that our ultra cold lattice only smears the fermi surface in a negligible way , we can locate the position of fermi surface by searching the peak of @xmath88 with the tiny frequency @xmath89 in the momentum space .",
    "such an identification of fermi surface is also described in @xcite and similar to the operational definition given in @xcite .    with this in mind , we show in fig.[fs1 ] an example with the 3d plot of @xmath90 for the fixed @xmath91 .",
    "a sharp peak occurs near @xmath92 , indicating a fermi surface with the fermi momentum @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , we may locate the positions of the fermi surface for other values of @xmath94 such that the shape of the fermi surface can be plotted in the momentum space .",
    "we illustrate our results in fig.[fs2 ] for the case of @xmath83 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which corresponds to a fermi surface located within the first brillouin zone , namely @xmath99 .",
    "although the shape of fermi surface appears like a circle in the plot , our data clearly tells us that it is not a circle any more . as a matter of fact",
    ", it can be precisely fit by an equation of ellipse as follows @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we find this fitting has a very high accuracy , which can be seen from our error bar analysis presented on the right side of fig.[fs2 ] .",
    "remarkably such a result is universal in the sense that our elliptical fermi surface is robust against the values of parameters in question except that the longer axis as well as the shorter axis is varied as it should be .",
    "now let us see how our elliptical fermi surface varies with our relevant parameters .",
    "as such , we introduce two quantities , namely , the difference between the longer axis and shorter axis @xmath103 as well as the eccentricity @xmath104 .",
    "the relevant results are listed in table [ amplitude ] , [ temperature ] , and [ charge ] .",
    "obviously , we observe the following behaviors    * as we increase the amplitude of our periodic source @xmath105 , both @xmath106 and @xmath107 are increased . *",
    "as we lower the temperature by increasing @xmath65 , both @xmath106 and @xmath107 are increased . * as we increase the charge @xmath1 , the fermi surface is enlarged with @xmath107 suppressed .",
    ".[amplitude ] the variation of @xmath106 and @xmath107 with the amplitude @xmath105 , where we have fixed the other parameters as @xmath83 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we remark that above phenomena can be observed in the ionic lattice background as well .",
    "interestingly , we find that in ionic lattice case , the longer axis of the ellipse changes from @xmath34 to @xmath108 direction .",
    "when the charge @xmath1 is large enough , the fermi surface will go beyond the first brillouin zone with @xmath109 .",
    "now let us turn to such a situation by first demonstrating the band structure of fermi surface in fig.[gap1 ] for the scalar lattice .",
    "note that the fermi surface exhibits a periodic structure along the @xmath110 direction as it should be the case guaranteed by bloch theorem . on the other hand",
    ", it appears that our fermi surface does not show the band gap structure at the intersection of the fermi surface with the brillouin zone boundary , which is at odds with the familiar lattice effect . in order to see",
    "if this is really the case , we zoom in the fermi surface precisely at the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "the corresponding result is plotted in fig.[gap2 ] . to our pleasure",
    ", the band gap shows up and becomes large with the increase of the amplitude of periodic source .",
    "so to see a clearer band gap structure , it is better to move on to the ionic lattice in which the lattice effects should be much stronger as we discussed in previous section . as shown in fig.[gap3 ] for the ionic lattice , the gap is evidently observed as one expects . from this figure",
    "we also notice that the band structure becomes richer when the fermi surface intersects with more than two brillouin zones .",
    "we have investigated the lattice effect on the fermi surface by putting the bulk dirac field in the ultra cold holographic lattices , where both the background equations and the probe dirac field are solved by pseudo - spectral method numerically .",
    "one interesting result is that the fermi surface is always modified by the lattice from a circle to an ellipse .",
    "suppose that such a fermi surface is formed by some kind of exotic free fermionic quasi - particles , then the elliptical shape means that the effective mass along the @xmath34 direction in scalar lattice ( or the @xmath108 direction in ionic lattice ) becomes more massive by some kind of renormalization effects due to the presence of the lattice . in any case",
    ", such a universal behavior of holographic fermi surface begs for a deeper understanding .",
    "in addition , we holographically reproduce the band gap structure at the intersection of the fermi surface and the brillouin zone boundary , which is a well known lattice effect on the fermi surface in condensed matter theory .",
    "note that such a band gap structure is also obtained in @xcite .",
    "we would like to compare our work with @xcite .",
    "the lattice considered in that paper is a weak ionic lattice , where the back reaction of the periodic chemical potential to the bulk geometry is ignored .",
    "the advantage of such a weak potential limit is two fold .",
    "one is that such a lattice can be put at zero temperature , and the other is that the analytic technique developed in @xcite can be borrowed heavily to the relevant perturbation calculation .",
    "the disadvantage is also obvious .",
    "first , the amplitude of spatially varying chemical potential must be small enough , otherwise the perturbation calculation will break down .",
    "second , the neglect of the back reaction may lead to the loss of some significant physics .",
    "for example , the elliptical fermi surface we find does not appear in the perturbation calculation .",
    "third , when such a perturbation calculation is made to higher order or for the non - diagonal components of retarded green function , the analysis will become much involved .",
    "compared with this , the full retarded green function can be obtained by our numerics once and for all . in this sense ,",
    "our paper and @xcite are complementary to each other .",
    "we conclude with various issues worthy of further investigation .",
    "first , even though it is numerically harder , it is apparently better to construct the zero temperature holographic lattices for our probe dirac field to propagate in .",
    "second , pertaining to the stm experiment , it is important for us to extract the retarded green function in the position space , which can be achieved in the following two ways .",
    "one is to fourier transform our resultant green function in the momentum space to the position space .",
    "the other is to work directly in the position space by imposing dirac delta source on the ads boundary .",
    "we hope to address these issues in the near future .",
