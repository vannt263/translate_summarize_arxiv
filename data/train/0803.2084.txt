    "optical lattice is an artificial lattice produced by standing wave of laser light@xcite . in a cold atom gas loaded on an optical lattice ,",

    "we briefly note that , in the hubbard model , interaction effects are parametrized by the scaled interaction @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 and @xmath1 represent an on - site pairing interaction and nearest - neighbor hopping , respectively ) .",
    "thus , in addition to the direct tuning of the pairing interaction by a feshbach resonance , continuous change from the weak- to strong - coupling regime can be also realized by adjusting the hopping parameter @xmath1 by tuning the intensity of laser light producing the optical lattice .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover in the attractive hubbard model has been discussed in superconductivity literature@xcite , in connection to strongly - correlated electron systems .",
    "nozires and schmitt - rink@xcite pointed out the mass enhancement of tightly bound molecules in the strong - coupling bec regime , because of virtual dissociation of a bound molecule during hopping between lattice sites .",

    "we determined @xmath0 and the fermi chemical potential @xmath15 self - consistently as functions of the pairing interaction @xmath5 and filling number @xmath49 in the bcs - bec crossover region , by solving the equation for @xmath0 , together with the number equation .",
    "cdw fluctuations are strong near the half - filling due to the nesting property of the fermi surface at @xmath52 .",
    "these strong fluctuations remarkably decrease the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath6 around @xmath52 . as a result ,",
    "the maximum @xmath0 is obtained , not at the half - filling , but away from the half - filling .",
    "we also showed that , although sdw fluctuations are weak in the attractive hubbard model , they still affect @xmath0 to increase slightly in the intermediate coupling region @xmath92 .    we have also discussed the validity of scta .",
    "our theory satisfies the required condition associated with the particle - hole symmetry of the hubbard model which is not derived from nsr theory .",
    "therefore , it would be a good starting point to improve the bcs - bec crossover theory in optical lattices .",
    "on the other hand , we showed that this approximation underestimates @xmath0 in the bec regime .",
    "as a key to understand this , we pointed out the importance of a repulsive interaction between molecules . since the gaussian fluctuation theory ( which completely ignores the molecular interaction at @xmath0 ) largely _ overestimates _",
    "@xmath0 , we expect that scta overestimates effects of the molecular interaction .",
    "indeed , the overestimate of the molecule interaction within scta has been pointed out@xcite in a uniform fermi gas with no lattice potential .",
    "inclusion of the correct value of the molecular interaction in the present theory is our future problem .",
    "so far , the superfluid fermi gas in an optical lattice has been realized when the lattice potential is weak@xcite . to really realize the hubbard model in a cold gas of fermi atoms ,",
    "stronger optical lattice potentials must be used , which , however , inevitably leads to a small nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath1 , as well as low @xmath0 .",
    "thus , to realize fermi superfluids in such a difficult situation , our results indicate that the filling number should be set to be away from @xmath52 ( to avoid the suppression of @xmath6 by cdw fluctuations ) so that one can reach @xmath0 as easy as possible under a given experimental condition . since the hubbard model is a fundamental model in condensed matter physics , realization of fermi superfluid in the hubbard model produced by strong optical lattice potential would be great challenge in cold atom physics .",

    "in this appendix , we explain how to use fft algorithm in transforming between the matsubara frequency and the imaginary time . as an example , we consider the single - particle green s function @xmath18 here . however , the method explained in this appendix can be also used in calculating the self - energies as well as correlation functions .",
    "we introduce a matsubara frequency cutoff @xmath74 and evaluate the green s function by using the fourier transformation . by introducing this cutoff frequency , the fourier transformation from the matsubara frequency into imaginary time",
