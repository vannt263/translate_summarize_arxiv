    "the stability of this pattern suggests an effective decoupling of the modes responsible for the phase transition from those determining the physical continuum limit , and therefore that evidences of scaling and asymptotic scaling could be provided by the large-@xmath2 strong coupling expansion .",

    "the resulting curve changes very little from that derived from the plain series , the difference between the two curves would not be visible in fig .  [ asyscaling ] .",

    "the integral approximant analysis of the above series , whose results are reported in table  [ cresumex ] , leads again to a second order type critical behavior with the following estimates of the critical @xmath1 and @xmath56 exponent : @xmath100 notice that this estimate of the exponent @xmath56 is very close to that of the square lattice .",
    "the uncertainty on both estimates can not really exclude that they are equal , which would be an indication of universality .",
    "also in this context we analyzed the strong coupling series of the logarithmic derivative of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath47 and @xmath101 by the modified integral approximant method which forces the existence of a zero at @xmath38 . in table",
    "[ chiresum ] we report the range of the exponent variations when varying the zero in the interval @xmath102 . as for the square lattice ,",

    "so a good test of rotation invariance is provided by the ratio between masses extracted from the long distance behaviors of a couple of orthogonal wall - wall correlation functions constructed with @xmath12 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we defined two orthogonal wall - wall correlation functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 , with the corresponding masses @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which should both reproduce the on - shell fundamental mass @xmath31 in the continuum limit . in order to extract @xmath107 and @xmath108 we evaluated the @xmath8 series of @xmath109 and the @xmath110 series of @xmath111 .",

    "such an instability should be cured by an extension of the series .",
