    "in materials science , one often encounters situations where the relevant properties of a material are crucially influenced by the local microstructure at certain localized regions in space , whereas almost everywhere else , in the `` bulk '' , the specific structure only matters in an average sense .",
    "for example , details of the local structure at surfaces are more important for many applications than details of the bulk structure @xcite . other prominent examples are nanocomposites , where the behavior of a material can be improved or even completely changed by filling it with small quantities of additives @xcite . for a physical modelling of such composites ,",
    "a finer description of the additives , e.g. , at the atomistic level or even quantum level , is necessary , while a coarser grained description of the remaining medium , e.g. , at a coarse - grained particle level or continuum level , is often sufficient .",
    "this clearly calls for multiscale hybrid simulation approaches .",
    "multiscale hybrid modelling is a challenging and rapidly developing field in the communities of condensed matter physics , materials science , and engineering @xcite .",
    "one prominent early example is the quantum mechanics ( qm)/molecular dynamics ( md ) scheme @xcite , where small ( e.g. , chemically reacting ) regions are treated at a quantum mechanical level and the environment by classical molecular dynamics . whereas particles can not move from one resolution region to another in the qm / mm scheme , the recently developed adaptive resolution schemes ( adress ) @xcite",
    "allow for free diffusion of particles and connect different resolution regions in space by means of smooth interpolation functions @xcite .",
    "adress schemes have been proposed that combine the hybrid atomistic / coarse grained scales @xcite and the quantum / coarse grained scales @xcite .",
    "however , these methods are restricted to particle - based simulation models .    on large scales , continuum descriptions which disregard microscopic details ( e.g. , elastic models , phase field models , hydrodynamic models ) are often favorable , since they work with collective variables that directly reflect the relevant mesoscopic properties of a material .",
    "hence hybrid multiscale schemes that couple small - scale particle - based descriptions to large - scale continuous descriptions are of particular interest .",
    "one relatively straightforward approach is to permanently treat certain components of a system as particles immersed in a continuous medium @xcite .",
    "another increasingly popular type of approach is concurrent particle / field modeling , where particle simulations are used to determine the dynamical evolution of a continuum model .",
    "prominent examples are the heterogeneous multiscale method @xcite , which uses particle simulations to adjust the rheological parameters of a hydrodynamic continuum model on the fly , and `` single chain in mean field '' simulation methods @xcite , where simulations of instantaneously uncorrelated chains are used to determine the dynamical evolution of fields in a dynamic density functional .",
    "however , few methods exist that allow to `` zoom into '' certain particle - resolved regions in space within a continuum simulation in an adaptive resolution sense .",
    "one such scheme was developed by delgado - buscalioni , de fabritiis , and coworkers @xcite .",
    "it can be applied to simple or molecular fluids and couples molecular dynamics simulations of fluids with the fluctuating navier - stokes equations @xcite through a hybrid interfacial region .",
    "another scheme which allows one to construct adaptive resolution models for soft materials in a formally exact manner was recently proposed by us @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss possible implementations and variants of this approach and to evaluate it systematically at the example of a simple model system , a confined homopolymer solution .",
    "the construction of our hybrid scheme starts from particle resolution ( pr ) models of the edwards type @xcite , in which the interactions are expressed in terms of local densities .",
    "edwards type models are popular starting points in theoretical polymer physics @xcite and are often used for the interpretation of experimental phenomena in soft matter and biophysics , as well as for efficient particle - based computer simulations @xcite . in our adaptive resolution approach ,",
    "we exploit the fact that the partition function of edwards models can be rewritten exactly as a fluctuating field theory . hence each edwards particle model",
    "has a continuum partner , and our scheme relies on the equivalence between the particle model and its continuum partner .",
    "this allows one to single out selected regions in space to be treated at a particle level within a field - based continuum simulation .",
    "we note that similar field theoretical mappings to continuous models can also be performed for other particle models , as long as particles do not interact with hard core interactions .",
    "our scheme is not limited to edwards models .",
    "however , the underlying particle must be coarse - grained in the sense that particle interactions are soft ( or of coulomb type ) . in the present paper , we will specifically consider the simplest edwards type model , which describes homopolymer solutions in an implicit solvent .",
    "this model already contains basic ingredients of soft matter systems , i.e. , the competition of entropy and interaction energy and the tunable and relatively large length scales which characterize soft systems .",
    "we construct the hybrid adaptive resolution scheme following the basic idea sketched in ref .",
    "@xcite , focussing on an implicit solvent system .",
    "we explain in detail the construction and implementation of the hybrid scheme , and evaluate the computational efficiency of the present scheme by comparison with its pure particle - based counterpart .",
    "we hope that the present work will help other researchers to implement the hybrid scheme .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 ,",
    "the hybrid model is derived , and numerical algorithms that can be applied in practical simulations are discussed .",
    "results for the confined homopolymer solution are presented in sec .",
    "we summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "in this section , we present the basic methodology of the hybrid particle - field simulation approach . for simplicity , we consider the simple system of a homopolymer solution in an implicit solvent .",
    "generalizations to other soft matter systems are straightforward .",
    "let us consider a collection of @xmath0 polymers in a three - dimensional volume @xmath1 .",
    "the polymers are modeled as linear chains of @xmath2 beads connected by gaussian springs @xcite with a spring constant @xmath3 , where we set @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath6 the temperature ) and @xmath7 is the mean - squared bond length . throughout this paper , we will measure lengths in units of the radius of the gyration of the ideal chain , @xmath8 , hence @xmath9 .",
    "the energy of the system is expressed as an edwards hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath10 ^ 2       + \\frac{v_0}{2}\\int d{\\mathbf}r\\hat\\phi^2_t({\\mathbf}r),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the position of the @xmath12-th bead on the @xmath13-th polymer .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the normalized density defined as the microscopic bead density profile @xmath15 divided by the average bead density @xmath16 .",
    "since the density is defined from the bead positions , the fundamental particle degrees of freedom are fully resolved in ( [ eq : edwardshamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : edwardshamiltonian ] ) describes the probability distribution of a gaussian chain .",
    "the second term accounts for the effective interaction between beads , and @xmath17 is the excluded volume parameter .",
    "the partition function in the canonical ensemble is given by @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the thermal wavelength accounting for the contribution from kinetic energy .",
    "physical quantities at equilibrium can be extracted from the partition function ( [ eq : z1 ] ) , for instance by monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "it can also serve as the starting point for pure field theoretical simulations .",
    "in the following we recast ( [ eq : z1 ] ) into an equivalent hybrid particle - field model in a mathematically exact way .",
    "the resulting model can then be treated numerically , thus combining the advantages of particle based monte carlo techniques and field theoretical simulations .",
    "this will be achieved in three steps : ( i ) the chains will be divided into two virtual species in such a way that the physics is unchanged .",
    "( ii ) the two species will then be treated by different representations , i.e. , one species is still described by beads whereas the second species will be described by fields .",
    "( iii ) the field representations will then be simplified by adopting approximations that make a numerical treatment more feasible .    in the first step the identical chains of the system",
    "are partitioned into two species which we call p - chain and f - chain .",
    "this can be done in several ways .",
    "the strategy we adopt in the following introduces additional `` spin '' variables @xmath20 for all the beads , each of which takes the values 1 or 0 , and a spatially varying conjugate `` potential '' @xmath21 which couples to the spin of a bead at position @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath13-th chain is defined to be an f - chain if all @xmath20 are 0 , otherwise it is a p - chain .",
    "the potentials @xmath23 thus lead to a partitioning into @xmath24 and @xmath25 chains of p- and f - type .",
    "hereafter , we refer to @xmath26 as the tuning function ( tf ) .",
    "the introduction of the partitioning and of the tf must not change the physics of the system .",
    "this is technically achieved by introducing the identities @xmath27}=1,\\ ] ] which are valid for each bead @xmath12 on each chain @xmath13 . inserting these identities into the partition function ( [ eq : z1 ] ) , we get @xmath28}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by construction , this partition function is equivalent to the original partition function ( [ eq : z1 ] ) , but the artificial variables @xmath29 introduce two different types of chains , and an inhomogeneous tf will generate an inhomogeneous partitioning in space .",
    "this , however , does not change the physics of the system . by adjusting the form of @xmath30",
    ", one can manipulate the individual density distribution for p - chains and f - chains .",
    "for example , larger values of @xmath30 in some regions will result in higher densities of p - chains in these regions , while smaller values of @xmath30 will result in higher density of f - chains . by construction",
    "the sums of the densities for p - chains and f - chains are the same independent of the choice of @xmath30 and are identical to the ones obtained directly from ( [ eq : z1 ] ) .    in the partitioning scheme discussed above ,",
    "@xmath31-chains and @xmath32-chains have a very different entropy in spin space : a p - chain can support @xmath33 possible combinations of spin variables , while only one spin combination is possible in f - chains . to compensate for this asymmetry and achieve @xmath34 ,",
    "the values of the tf must be of order @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "alternative ways to assign virtual identities that avoid this asymmetry are also conceivable .",
    "for example , one could attach a spin variable @xmath36 only to the first bead of the @xmath13-th chain , and declare this chain to be a p- or f - chain if @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively . in this scheme , the identity ( [ eq : idtau ] ) is only inserted for beads @xmath39 on chains @xmath13 .",
    "the space - dependent tuning function @xmath40 still determines the spatial distribution of the p- and f - chains and their total numbers @xmath41 and @xmath42 , but now the partitioning into p - chains and f - chains is symmetric : the local ratio of f- and p - chains can be exactly reversed by reversing the sign of @xmath43 and at @xmath44 , the p- and f - chains have the same density distribution . despite the advantages of such a symmetric scheme , we will use the asymmetric version described earlier , because it treats all beads on the chain on equal footing .",
    "the above construction partitions all chains into either p - chains or f - chains , but they are both still described by particle degrees of freedom . however , we are free to choose other representation methods .",
    "one possibility is to describe all the chains by continuum field models .",
    "the transition from pr models to field resolution ( fr ) models can be done in a formally exact way using field theoretic methods ( see below ) , and field - theoretic simulation methods have proved to be powerful tools to investigate the properties of polymeric systems@xcite . in the hybrid model , we describe only the f- chains by the fr method and the others still by the pr method .",
    "the advantage of such an scheme lies in its ability to exploit and combine the specialties and advantages of different representation schemes simultaneously .    to this end",
    ", we first reorder the sum over chains @xmath13 such that the @xmath31-chains come first .",
    "the conversion of f - chains to a field representation is then done following a standard field - theoretical method , i.e. , the fields are introduced through inserting an identity into the partition function @xcite @xmath45\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the configurational dependent density of all beads belonging to f - chains , @xmath47 is the fluctuating density field corresponding to these f - chains , and @xmath48 is the fluctuating auxiliary field conjugate to the density field . inserting this identity effectively decouples the particle degrees of freedom of f - chains such that they can be integrated out .",
    "each f - chain then contributes the same factor @xmath49 to the partition function , where @xmath50 is the normalized single - chain partition function @xmath51= \\frac{1}{z_0 } \\int d{\\mathbf}r_0\\cdots d{\\mathbf}r_{n-1 } } \\quad & \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times \\exp\\big\\ { & -\\frac{n}{4 }    \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{n-1}({\\mathbf}r_j-{\\mathbf}r_{j-1})^2-\\frac{1}{n }    \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{n-1}i w_f[{\\mathbf}r_j]\\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\:\\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{n-1}\\ln[e^{\\delta\\mu({\\mathbf}r_j)}+1]\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the subscripts @xmath52 refer to the indices of beads within a chain ) .",

    "we note again that there are two kinds of independent degrees of freedom left in the model .",
    "one refers to the configurational space which belongs to the pr part , the other is the auxiliary field which belongs to the fr part .",
    "now we work simultaneously with two kinds of representations , the pr and the fr coexisting in the very same system . within the pr ,",
    "polymer chains are characterized by the positions of beads , and the detailed information about configurations is still accessible .",
    "consequently the pr part is referred to as a high resolution representation .",
    "the fr of f - chains corresponds to a lower resolution since the configurational information on individual chains is lost , only the continuous density can be observed . the regions in space",
    "where the high and the low resolution is adopted are adjusted by the choice of @xmath66 which governs where the respective representation prevails .",
    "the combined particle - field approach is constructed such that it is formally equivalent to the pure particle model , due to the fact that the field description is introduced by an identity transformation / operator in the partition function .",
    "independent of the choice of the tf , one should obtain the same density distributions for both the pure particle model and the hybrid model .",
    "in reality , however , the two models are not truly equivalent , since simulations of the field model inevitably must make approximations .",
    "most importantly , the space must be discretized .",
    "this amounts to a regularization of the field theory which is necessary both for obvious practical reasons and for fundamental reasons , to eliminate ultraviolet divergences in the theory @xcite .",
    "the fr model is thus necessarily coarse - grained with a coarse - graining cutoff that is set by the grid size ( which gives us one more justification to refer to the fr representation as the `` low resolution '' representation ) .",
    "we note that the finite cutoff leads to a renormalization of model parameters both in the field theory @xcite and in particle simulations with density - based edwards - type interactions @xcite ( since the density dependent interactions are also evaluated on a grid , see sec .",
    "[ simulation ] ) .    in practical applications of the hybrid model , further approximation may be necessary at the fr level to achieve the desired speedup of the simulation time .",
    "they are discussed in the next section .",
    "the hybrid particle - field model has particle degrees of freedom ( the bead positions ) and field degrees of freedom ( density fields and auxiliary potentials @xmath67 ) .",
    "one difficulty arises from the fact that the free energy functional of the fields @xmath64 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalf ] ) ) becomes complex .",
    "simulations of pure fr models are nevertheless possible with the complex langevin technique @xcite , however , they become cumbersome and time consuming . in a hybrid simulation , the complex langevin simulation scheme would involve a random walk of _ all _ degrees of freedom including the particle degrees of freedom in the whole complex plane .",
    "this would seriously affect the pr part of the simulation . in order to avoid that problem ,",
    "we resort to integrating out some or all field degrees of freedom beforehand within a saddle point approximation .",
    "this has the additional advantage that it significantly speeds up the simulations .",
    "one possibility is to carry out the saddle point integration over @xmath48 and keep the explicit integral over the  density  field @xmath47 .",

    "this variable transformation is associated with a jacobian , which can be incorporated in an additional contribution to @xmath90 . however , this contribution is of the same order of magnitude than the leading ( gaussian ) fluctuation correction to the saddle point integral , and will be neglected as well .",

    "alternatively , we can also carry out the saddle point integration with respect to both fluctuating fields , @xmath81 and @xmath86 .",
    "hence @xmath60 is minimized with respect to both fields , which results in two saddle point equations , eq .",

    "this quantity is easily accessible for p - chains , and it can not be calculated for f - chains , therefore we only consider p - chains here .",
    "we cut the simulation box along the @xmath178 direction into @xmath209 slices centered at @xmath210 for the @xmath211-th slice , and the msrgs at @xmath210 are defined as the corresponding averages of all the p - chains with their centers in this slice .",
    "we note that there are other quantities that can be extracted from both p - chains and f - chains , such as the chain - shape function @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : rg ] shows the msrg profiles of p - chains along the @xmath178-direction in the pure particle model and the hybrid model with tf1 and tf2 .",
    "only the profiles of the @xmath178-component of the msrg ( @xmath212 ) are plotted ",
    "the @xmath187- and @xmath188-components of the msrg ( @xmath213 ) are constant throughout and assume the value @xmath214 which is expected theoretically for gaussian chains .",
    "the @xmath178-component reaches the same value in the middle of the slab ( bulk region ) , but close to the boundaries , the polymers are a bit compressed .",
    "this can be seen both in the pure particle model and the hybrid model .",
    "the curves almost match close to the wall  in the p - domain of the hybrid model  and in the middle of the slab  in the f - domain . in the intermediate region connecting p- and f - domains , the msrg of the p - chains in the hybrid model deviates from the msrg measured in the particle model : it is slightly reduced at the p - side of the p / f domain boundary , and strongly enhanced at the f - side .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the partitioning of chains into p- and f - chains depends on their conformation in the p / f boundary region .",
    "on the f - side , p - chains that stretch into the p - domain turn into f - chains with smaller probability than p - chains that withdraw from the p - domain .",
    "hence the remaining p - chains are on average elongated in the @xmath178-direction . on the p - side ,",
    "the situation is the other way round : chains that stretch into the f - domain turn into f - chains with higher probability , and the remaining p - chains are slightly compressed on average .",
    "the effect can be reduced by adopting a smoother tf , e.g. , by reducing @xmath215 , see the curves ib and iib in fig.[fig : rg ] , or by reducing @xmath185 ( data not shown ) , but it never fully disappears .",
    "hence it is important to realize that the p - chains in the p / f - boundary regions ( within 2.5 @xmath171 of the boundary defined by the tf ) are not representative of all chains in the system and should not be used to determine conformational properties of chains .",
    "this is a feature of the model , not an artefact .",
    "more seriously , the total density also exhibits a very small dip in the p / f - boundary region@xcite .",
    "deviations of the total density are also observed in other hybrid methods , and an additional potential is sometimes introduced in order to remove these artefacts @xcite .",
    "this is also an option in our model . in the present application to confined homopolymer slabs ,",
    "the effect is so small that an adjustment was not necessary .",
    "increasing computational efficiency is always the primary motivation for introducing multiscale schemes , and we would like to show in the following that the present hybrid method is more efficient than pure particle simulations .",
    "the computational costs of a simulation based on a particle model scales with the number of particles , while in a field description , it scales with the number @xmath216 of grid points that are used to discretize space ( or with @xmath217 if fourier methods are used ) .",
    "therefore , the hybrid model is most efficient in dense systems , where the number of segments ( beads ) per grid cell is large . at fixed number of grid points",
    ", one can choose a tf such that the total number of p - chains is small , and this makes the simulation efficient .    in order to evaluate the efficiency of our hybrid scheme",
    ", we use the same methods to update the particle configurations in the pure particle simulation and the hybrid simulation , and perform the calculations on the same desktop computer ( i7 cpu , 2.67 ghz ) .",
    "we find that in each mc step , the computational cost for updating the chain configurations dominates the total costs , hence the choice of @xmath107 ( i.e. , whether we choose @xmath218 or @xmath219 ) and @xmath108 has little influence on the overall computational costs .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath108 does strongly affect the equilibration time for the effective energy . from fig .",
    "[ fig : timea ] , one can see that the hybrid calculation with tf1 , where about half of the chains are p - chains , is roughly 1.4 times faster than the pure particle simulation , while one can achieve a speedup of a factor 3.5 with tf2 , where about 1/5 of all chains are p - chains .",
    "reducing @xmath107 by a factor of 3 has only a small influence on the computational costs .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeb ] shows the relaxation of the effective free energy to the equilibrium value .",
    "the relaxation is almost independent of @xmath220 in the present system , hence we choose @xmath221 for all cases .",
    "it can been seen that the pure particle method converges very rapidly , while the relaxation in the hybrid simulation is a bit slower , since additional time is necessary to equilibrate the partitioning between p - chains and f - chains .",
    "although it takes more time to equilibrate the system within the hybrid method , this equilibration period is still very short ( about 100 cpu seconds ) compared to the much longer times ( about 6000 cpu seconds ) required for calculating the statistical averages .",
    "the hybrid method develops its high efficiency in this second stage , where data are accumulated .",
    "if the computational costs would strictly scale with the number of particles , we would reach a theoretical speedup of a factor of 5 in our system .",
    "this number is reduced due to the overhead costs for bookkeeping , field updates and switch moves ( separating these costs is difficult ) , but we could still reach a speedup factor of 3.5 . in systems where the fraction of particle resolved domains is smaller , the speedup will be even larger .    when judging the efficiency of a computational algorithm , another aspect that has to be considered is the complexity of the technique , and the man - hours needed to implement it .",
    "the ultimate goal is always to devise simple algorithms with high computational efficiency , although this is usually hard to achieve in practice .",
    "the new constituent in the present scheme compared to the usual particle - based mc scheme and field - based theory ( e.g. , self - consistent field theory ) is the particle switching .",
    "thus the hybrid scheme can be implemented by adding particle - switching algorithms that are executed after updating particle positions and fields .",
    "the switching algorithm is short and not complex , and the man - hours necessary for implementing it are less than or comparable to those required for writing a code for its pure particle - based counterpart . from a practical point of view",
    ", the main challenge is to combine particle and field simulation methods in one single package ",
    "i.e. , introduce fr simulation methods in codes designed for particle simulations and vice versa .",
    "however , as explained in the introduction , there is generally a growing interest in hybrid schemes that combine particle and field methods .",
    "within a package that can already combine particle and field - based ( ddft ) simulation schemes , the implementation of our adaptive hybrid scheme should not require much effort .",
    "in all of the above calculations , only the fluctuations of p - chains were taken into account , and those of the fields were neglected . fluctuations sometimes play an important role in determining the properties of a dilute solution or a dense system near the critical point of a phase transition . in general",
    "one should devise methods that account for fluctuations whenever necessary .",
    "the present hybrid method does not abandon all fluctuation effects in principle , rather they are treated in different ways due to the difference of types of degrees of freedom .",
    "the configurations are sampled by the particle based method through particle moves , while the fields are sampled by the field based method through the evolution of fields .",
    "we have up to now focused on methods that neglect fluctuations in the fr part . in the following ,",
    "we incorporate the fluctuations to the field by using the unbiased and biased potential sampling schemes ( see subsection [ simulation ] ) .",
    "we choose a small size of box in the @xmath187 and @xmath188 directions with also a small number of grid points , i.e. , @xmath222 , @xmath223 .",

    "the results are independent of the step length @xmath220 .",
    "the curves obtained from these three different schemes are almost identical , which is expected , since the density of the polymers in the system is very high , and the fluctuation effect is expected to be small . in our applications , we find that the pb schemes is not as efficient as the pu and ddft schemes .",

    "the densities obtained with these three schemes almost match each other . ]",
    "even if we use advanced monte carlo techniques such as the pb scheme to sample the field fluctuations , they do not represent the true dynamics of the system . in order to study rheological and dynamical properties ,",
    "the hybrid scheme should be complemented with a consistent dynamical model .",
    "in particular , mass ( particle number ) and momentum should be locally conserved .",
    "particle models with ",
    "realistic \" dynamics satisfy this requirement .",
    "for example , overdamped brownian particle simulations conserve the mass , while dissipative particle dynamics conserves both mass and momentum . on the side of the field model , the maurits - fraaije @xcite density dynamics",
    "conserves mass , at least approximately , and such ddft models can be extended such that momentum is conserved as well @xcite .",
    "difficulties in a true hybrid dynamics model arise from the requirement of mass and momentum conservation during the process of resolution switching .",
    "several works have tried to address these notoriously difficult issues in hybrid models , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that particle - based brownian simulations , combined with field - based density dynamics and a particle - field switching process which is compatible with the continuity equation for the mass , could capture the dynamics of the system at the same level as pure particle - based brownian simulations .",
    "the construction of such a model is currently under way .",
    "in the present paper , a hybrid particle - continuum simulation scheme with adaptive resolution for soft matter systems was derived based on a field - theoretical approach . in such a hybrid resolution method",
    ", polymer chains can switch their representations on the fly according to a pre - determined tuning function tf . a proper form of tf",
    "can ensure that polymer chains are described by particles in small selected regions in order to directly observe the configuration dependent properties , and by density profiles in the remaining large bulk regions , where configuration details are not interesting .",
    "therefore , the hybrid scheme is computationally more efficient than the pure particle method , while keeping the physical accuracy in the particle regions .",
    "the hybrid approach is particularly attractive for simulations of dense systems where particle simulations become expensive compared to field - based simulations .    in the present formulation of the hybrid model , the high - resolution domains have to be determined beforehand .",
    "they may follow polymer - solid interfaces , e.g. , in applications to polymer nanocomposites , but they do not explicitly depend on the polymer configuration .",
    "hence our scheme is adaptive , but not self - adaptive .",
    "constructing a self - adaptive scheme is another major challenge for the future .",
    "physically , self - adaptive means that the tf should be determined by the system itself .",
    "so far , the shape of the tf is essentially a tanh function with pre - defined amplitude , offset , interface position and step width .",
    "none of these parameters is determined by the system itself . however , the optimal tf depends on the intrinsic properties of the hybrid system .",
    "for example , due to the asymmetric property of the p - chains and f - chains , a non - zero reference value of @xmath23 where the fraction of p- and f - chains is equal can be calculated which can then be used as offset .",
    "concerning the step width and the locations of the p / f interfaces , one possible and practical way is to directly relate them to the local density and/or the local density gradient .",
    "the tuning function could be chosen such that it has large values in interfacial regions ( where the total density curve has a large slope ) and low values in the bulk ( where the slope is zero ) .",
    "this should give the desired result that p - chains aggregate in the interface while f - chains are dominant in the bulk .",
    "such hybrid models could then be called self - adaptive resolution models in the sense that the chains described by different resolution models can switch and redistribute according to the local density .",
    "we will explore this option in future work .",
    "the present hybrid model is constructed such that it targets polymer solutions .",
    "however , the basic idea of the hybrid model can be applied to other systems .",
    "the approach is especially suitable for very large systems with large bulk regions and small interface regions or small regions that need detailed investigation .",
    "one example is a polymer brush system , in which a small number of brush polymers are attached to a plate , while a large number of polymers remain in the bulk .",
    "for such a system , the hybrid model is recommended .",
    "the brush polymers can be treated by higher resolution method , i.e. , the pr method , to catch the more detailed properties ( for example , the lengths of chains ) , while the large bulk region can be treated by lower resolution method , i.e. , the fr method , to save time .",
    "the studies of a homopolymer solution using the hybrid scheme show good agreement with those by the reference pure particle method , and the hybrid scheme has demonstrated its higher computational efficiency .",

    "<S> we discuss in detail a recently proposed hybrid particle - continuum scheme for complex fluids and evaluate it at the example of a confined homopolymer solution in slit geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid scheme treats polymer chains near the impenetrable walls as particles keeping the configuration details , and chains in the bulk region as continuous density fields . </S>",
    "<S> polymers can switch resolutions on the fly , controlled by an inhomogeneous tuning function . by properly choosing the tuning function , </S>",
    "<S> the representation of the system can be adjusted to reach an optimal balance between physical accuracy and computational efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid simulation reproduces the results of a reference particle simulation and is significantly faster ( about a factor of 3.5 in our application example ) . </S>"
