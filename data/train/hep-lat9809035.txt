    "we like to think of the simplest multi - quark system , consisting of four quarks , as a bridge between a single hadron and interacting multi - hadron systems .",
    "earlier , simulations of static four - quark systems have been performed for a general set of geometries  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) . these quenched su(2 )",
    "calculations have produced binding energies up to 120 mev . in order to understand these results",
    "a phenomenological model based on two - body potentials and multi - quark interaction terms has been developed .",
    "the basis states of the model come from the three possible ways to pair four quarks into two mesons in su(2 ) .",
    "these pairing are taken to be in the ground state ( @xmath3 ) or first excited state ( @xmath4 ) of the two - body potential , giving six states ( @xmath5 ) in total .",
    "the basic equation of the model is @xmath6=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 contains overlaps of any two states ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 has the interactions ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 is the four - quark energy .",
    "the binding energy is defined as @xmath12 , i.e. as the difference of the four - quark energy and the energy of the lowest - lying two - body pairing .",
    "a central element in the model is a multi - quark interaction term @xmath13 , defined as @xmath14 . for small distances @xmath15 and for large @xmath16 .",
    "the potentials @xmath17 have a perturbative one - gluon exchange prefactor and lattice two - body potentials @xmath18 , giving the form @xmath19",
    ". this expression alone would lead to unphysical van der waals forces , which are removed by the @xmath13 .",
    "the interaction between basis states @xmath20 and @xmath21 is thus @xmath22 .",
    "the factor @xmath13 can be parameterized as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the string tension and @xmath25 the minimum area bounded by the four quarks .",
    "a simple version of the model with just states @xmath26 and @xmath15 is reproduced by perturbation theory to @xmath27@xcite .",
    "for quarks at the corners of a regular tetrahedron binding increases with size , which suggests two - body excitations are relevant , as they are closer to the ground state for larger distances .",
    "therefore , we have included excited basis states in our model .",
    "this gives new @xmath13-factors @xmath28 , the former of which is parametrized like @xmath13 and the latter as @xmath29 .",
    "the interaction matrix elements involving two - body excitations are parameterized in a manner similar to the ground state matrix elements , e.g. @xmath30 $ ] .    when this model is fitted to 100 ground and excited state four - quark energies it turns out that @xmath31 is always consistent with one , suggesting that two - body excitations interact in a perturbative manner .",
    "we are left with four independent parameters @xmath32 that fit the energies with @xmath33 .",
    "the values of these parameters are stable when energies from smaller lattice spacings are used .",
    "if the excited basis states are left out we get @xmath34 , which mostly comes from the maximally degenerate regular tetrahedra .",
    "the flux distribution is measured in quenched su(2 ) using @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the wilson loop , or more generally , a combination of wilson loops corresponding to the ground or excited state of the multi - quark system . since extracting a signal",
    "is not easy we use link - integration on the wilson loops . as in the calculation of energies ,",
    "we utilize a variational approach in order to extract the ground or an excited state of the system .",
    "the variational basis is formed of wilson loops with various levels of fuzzing .",
    "we can check the accuracy of our flux measurement with lattice sum rules .",
    "these sum rules relate spatial sums over fields to energies via @xmath37-functions such as @xmath38 , e.g. @xmath39 . \\\\\\ ] ] using our earlier two - quark results  @xcite for @xmath40 this relation allows us to compare the sum over the distribution to a much more accurately measured energy .",
    "this is especially convenient when the binding is considered ; @xmath41 is a lattice artefact from quark self - energies , and is removed for the binding energy .",
    "three - dimensional pictures of our results ( fig .",
    "1 ) can be viewed at www.physics.helsinki.fi/~ppennane / pics/. the binding distribution is found to have approximately constant height in between the quarks , whereas the first excited state has a `` cloverleaf '' symmetry with sign changes . replacing energies with flux distributions in our model without excitated basis states",
    "gives @xmath42 , which agrees with fits to energies  @xcite .",
    "when excited basis states are included the ground - state interaction has shorter range ; @xmath43 , suggesting that ground state potentials are important at small distances and excited ones at larger distances .",
    "we calculate the potential between two heavy - light mesons as a function of the heavy quark separation @xmath44 in quenched su(3 ) at @xmath45 .",
    "the heavy quarks are taken to be static and the light ones have approximately the @xmath46 mass ( @xmath47 ) with the propagators obtained as stochastic pseudofermionic estimates with maximal variance reduction  @xcite .",
    "the principal advantage of the stochastic estimates is the ability to get propagators to and from most points on the lattice ; hence the nickname `` all - to - all '' .    at @xmath48 the meson - antimeson ( @xmath49 ) system",
    "should have a mass similar to a pion , while the @xmath50 system should resemble a heavy - light baryon ; the former is indeed observed .",
    "the preliminary results in fig .",
    "[ fb4 ] do not show the one-@xmath51 exchange effect of deuson models which leads to differences in the @xmath50 and @xmath49 potentials at large distances . as expected , at small distances",
    "the @xmath49 potential is more attractive .",
    "as discussed in other papers in these proceedings  @xcite , the heavy - light meson - antimeson system is relevant to string breaking .",
    "unfortunately calculations of this system at large enough distances are very hard , but the all - to - all propagator scheme offers a way to overcome the difficulties . in our case",
    "the @xmath49 and static @xmath52 energies become equal at @xmath53 fm  @xcite ; this is reached by our ongoing calculations on a @xmath54 lattice .",
    "a variational operator mixing analysis  @xcite similar to that presented by philipsen in a higgs model is then performed . by running our code on ukqcd unquenched configurations we hope to shed light on the differences due to sea quarks in the mixing region .",
