    "as an aftermath of the recent devastating financial crisis , more sophisticated risk management practices are now being required under the basel ii accord . in order to satisfy the capital adequacy requirements , a bank needs to closely monitor how much of its asset values has been damaged ; it needs to examine whether it maintains sufficient equity values or needs to start enhancing its equity to asset ratio by raising more capital and/or selling its assets . due to unexpected sharp declines in asset values as experienced in the fall of 2008 , optimally determining when to undertake the action is an important and difficult problem . in this paper",
    ", we give a new framework for this problem and obtain its solutions explicitly .",
    "we propose an alarm system that determines when a bank needs to start enhancing its own capital ratio .",
    "we use lvy processes with jumps in order to model defaults in its loan / credit assets and sharp declines in their values under unstable market conditions .",
    "because of their negative jumps and the necessity to allow time for completing its capital reinforcement plans , early practical action is needed to reduce the risk of violating the capital adequacy requirements . on the other hand , there is also a cost of premature undertaking .",
    "if the action is taken too quickly , it may run a risk of incurring a large amount of opportunity costs including burgeoning administrative and monitoring expenses .",
    "in other words , we need to solve this tradeoff in order to implement this alarm system .    in this paper , we properly quantify the costs of delay and premature undertaking and set a well - defined objective function that models this tradeoff .",
    "our problem is to obtain a stopping time that minimizes the objective function .",
    "we expect that this precautionary measure gives a new framework in risk management .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complete probability space on which a lvy process @xmath1 is defined .",
    "we represent , by @xmath2 , a bank s _ net worth _ or _",
    "equity capital _ allocated to its loan / credit business and model the defaults in its credit portfolio in terms of the negative jumps . for example , for a given standard",
    "brownian motion @xmath3 and a jump process @xmath4 independent of @xmath5 , if it admits a decomposition @xmath6 for some @xmath7 and @xmath8 , then @xmath9 models the defaults as well as rapid increase in capital whereas the non - jump terms @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent , respectively , the growth of the capital ( through the cash flows from its credit portfolio ) and its fluctuations caused by non - default events ( e.g. , change in interest rates ) .",
    "since @xmath2 is spatially homogeneous , we may assume , without loss of generality , that the first time @xmath2 _ reaches or goes below zero _ signifies the event that the net capital requirement is violated .",
    "we call this the _ violation event _ and denote it by @xmath12 where we assume @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the filtration generated by @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath15 is an @xmath16-stopping time taking values on @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the set of all stopping times _ smaller than or equal to _ the violation event ; namely , @xmath19    we only need to consider stopping times in @xmath18 because the violation event is observable and the game is over once it happens . by taking advantage of this ,",
    "we see that the problem can be reduced to a well - defined optimal stopping problem ; see section [ sec : model ] .",
    "our goal is to obtain among @xmath18 the _ alarm time _ that minimizes the two costs we describe below .",
    "the first cost we consider is the risk that the alarm will be triggered _ at or after _ the violation event : @xmath20 , \\quad \\tau \\in { \\mathcal{s}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is a discount rate and @xmath22 is the probability measure and @xmath23 is the expectation under which the process starts at @xmath24 .",
    "we call this the _ violation risk_. in particular , when @xmath25 , it can be reduced under a suitable condition to the probability of the event @xmath26 ; see section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the second cost relates to premature undertaking measured by @xmath27 , \\quad \\tau \\in { \\mathcal{s}}.\\ ] ] we shall call this the _ regret _ , and here we assume @xmath28 to be _ continuous _ , _ non - decreasing _ and @xmath29 < \\infty , \\quad x > 0 .",
    "\\label{cond_integrability}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the monotonicity assumption reflects the fact that , if a bank has a higher capital value @xmath2 , then it naturally has better access to high quality assets and hence the opportunity cost @xmath30 becomes higher accordingly . in particular , when @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath32 for every @xmath33 ) , we have @xmath34 - { \\mathbb{e}}^x [ e^{-q \\theta } ] \\right ) , \\quad q > 0 \\label{regret_h_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the former is well - defined by .",
    "now , using some fixed weight @xmath35 , we consider a linear combination of these two costs described above : @xmath36we solve the problem of minimizing for the _",
    "double exponential jump diffusion process _ and a general _ spectrally negative lvy process_. the objective function is finite thanks to the integrability assumption , and hence the problem is well - defined .",
    "the form of this objective function in has an origin from the _ bayes risk _ in mathematical statistics . in the bayesian formulation of _ change - point detection _ , the bayes risk is defined as a linear combination of the expected detection delay and false alarm probability . in _ sequential hypothesis testing _ , it is a linear combination of the expected sample size and misdiagnosis probability .",
    "the optimal solutions in these problems are those stopping times that minimize the corresponding bayes risks .",
    "namely , the tradeoff between promptness and accuracy is modeled in terms of the bayes risk .",
    "similarly , in our problem , we model the tradeoff between the violation risk and regret by their linear combination @xmath37 .    we first consider the double exponential jump diffusion process , a lvy process consisting of a brownian motion and a compound poisson process with positive and negative exponentially - distributed jumps .",
    "we consider this classical model as an excellent starting point mainly due to a number of existing analytical properties and the fact that the results can potentially be extended to the hyper - exponential jump diffusion model ( hem ) and more generally to the phase - type lvy model . due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution , the distributions of the first passage times and overshoots by this process",
    "can be obtained explicitly ( kou and wang @xcite ) .",
    "it is this property that leads to analytical solutions in various problems that would not be possible for other jump processes .",
    "kou and wang @xcite used this process as an underlying asset and obtained a closed form solution to the perpetual american option and the laplace transforms of lookback and barrier options .",
    "sepp @xcite derived explicit pricing formulas for double - barrier and double - touch options with time - dependent rebates .",
    "see also lipton and sepp @xcite for applications of its multi - dimensional version in credit risk . some of the results for the double - exponential jump diffusion process have been extended to the hem and phase - type models , for example , by cai et al .",
    "@xcite and asmussen et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we then consider a general spectrally negative lvy process , or a lvy process with only negative jumps . because we are interested in defaults ,",
    "the restriction to negative jumps does not lose much reality in modeling .",
    "we also see that positive jumps do not have much influence on the solutions .",
    "we shall utilize the _",
    "scale function _ to simplify the problem and obtain analytical solutions . in order to identify the candidate optimal strategy",
    ", we shall apply _ continuous and smooth fit _ for the cases @xmath2 has paths of bounded and unbounded variation , respectively .",
    "the scale function is an important tool in most spectrally negative lvy models and can be calculated via algorithms such as surya @xcite and egami and yamazaki @xcite .",
    "our model is original , and , to the best of our knowledge , the objective function defined in ( [ def_u ] ) can not be found elsewhere .",
    "it is , however , relevant to the problem , arising in the optimal capital structure framework , of determining the endogenous bankruptcy levels .",
    "the original diffusion model was first proposed by leland @xcite and leland and toft @xcite , and it was extended , via the wiener - hopf factorization , to the model with jumps by hilberink and rogers @xcite .",
    "kyprianou and surya @xcite studied the case with a general spectrally negative lvy process . in their problems ,",
    "the continuous and smooth fit principle is a main tool in obtaining the optimal bankruptcy levels .",
    "chen and kou @xcite and dao and jeanblanc @xcite , in particular , focus on the double exponential jump diffusion case .    in the _ insurance _ literature ,",
    "as exemplified by the _ cramer - lundberg _ model , the compound poisson process is commonly used to model the surplus of an insurance firm . recently ,",
    "more general forms of jump processes are also used ( e.g. , huzak et al .",
    "@xcite and jang @xcite ) . for generalizations to the spectrally negative lvy model ,",
    "see avram et al .",
    "@xcite , kyprianou and palmowski @xcite , and loeffen @xcite .",
    "the literature also includes computations of ruin probabilities and extensions to jumps with heavy - tailed distributions ; see embrechts et al.@xcite and references therein .",
    "see also schmidli @xcite for a survey on stochastic control problems in insurance .",
    "mathematical statistics problems as exemplified by sequential testing and change - point detection have a long history .",
    "it dates back to 1948 when wald and wolfowitz @xcite used the bayesian approach and proved the optimality of the sequential probability ratio test ( sprt ) .",
    "there are essentially two problems , the _ bayesian _ and the _ variational _ ( or the _ fixed - error _ ) problems ; the former minimizes the bayes risk while the latter minimizes the expected detection delay ( or the sample size ) subject to a constraint that the error probability is smaller than some given threshold .",
    "for comprehensive surveys and references , we refer the reader to peskir and shiryaev @xcite and shiryaev @xcite .",
    "our problem was originally motivated by the bayesian problem .",
    "however , it is also possible to consider its variational version where the regret needs to be minimized on constraint that the violation risk is bounded by some threshold .",
    "optimal stopping problems involving jumps ( including the discrete - time model ) are , in general , analytically intractable owing to the difficulty in obtaining the overshoot distribution .",
    "this is true in our problem and in the literatures introduced above .",
    "for example , in sequential testing and change - point detection , explicit solutions can be realized only in the wiener case . for this reason",
    ", recent research focuses on obtaining asymptotically optimal solutions by utilizing renewal theory ; see , for example , baron and tartakovsky @xcite , baum and veeravalli @xcite , lai @xcite and yamazaki @xcite .",
    "although we do not address in this paper , asymptotically optimal solutions to our problem may be pursued for a more general class of lvy processes via renewal theory .",
    "we refer the reader to gut @xcite for the overshoot distribution of random walks and siegmund @xcite and woodroofe @xcite for more general cases in nonlinear renewal theory .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as in the following .",
    "we first give an optimal stopping model for a general lvy process in the next section .",
    "section [ sec : double_exponential ] focuses on the double exponential jump diffusion process and solve for the case when @xmath38 .",
    "section [ sec : spectrally_negative ] considers the case when the process is a general spectrally negative lvy process ; we obtain the solution explicitly in terms of the scale function for a general @xmath39 .",
    "we conclude with numerical results in section [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "long proofs are deferred to the appendix .",
    "in this section , we first reduce our problem to an optimal stopping problem and illustrate the continuous and smooth fit approach to solve it .",

    "the integrability assumption implies @xmath62 ( without this assumption @xmath63 and the problem becomes trivial ) .",
