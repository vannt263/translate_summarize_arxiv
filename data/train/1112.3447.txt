    "galactic winds have been observed at different wavelengths in galaxies of various masses and in a range of redshifts .",
    "galaxies , especially with star formation rates ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 kpc@xmath9 , often show large outflow of hot gas that emits x - rays and in which cold clouds are found to be embedded , which are observed with h@xmath10 or nad lines @xcite .",
    "the speed of the clouds in the wind range from a few tens to several hundred km s@xmath1 , and the total mass loss rate can be several times the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "these outflows play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies by expunging gas , and thereby suppressing the star formation .",
    "the attempts to understand galactic evolution in the cosmological context have since long encountered the so - called cooling catastrophe problem , since left to its own device the baryonic gas would cool and form stars more rapidly than observed .",
    "it is generally believed that a feedback loop inhibits this , and that the process of star formation excites an outflow and quenches itself .",
    "the observed mass - metallicity relation in galaxies also indicate that galactic outflows play a major role in the chemical evolution in galaxies .",
    "furthermore , these outflows enrich the intergalactic medium with metals .",
    "the standard model to understand galactic outflows involves a heated interstellar medium ( ism ) under the influence of supernovae ( sn ) , and the hot gas being driven by thermal pressure @xcite .",
    "the expansion speed of this hot gas can be large enough to eject it out of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the observations of cold gas in these outflows @xcite led to the proposal that the cold gas entrained in the hot gas moved due to ram pressure .",
    "the wind speed was however not found to correlate with galaxy mass @xcite , and it was argued that the supernovae rate increased with sfr and hence the wind velocity might correlate with sfr . simulations also supported this scenario @xcite .",
    "however , there is a limiting cloud speed implicit in this process since ram pressure acts on the cold gas until the cold gas velocity becomes equal to that of hot gas .",
    "this scenario , however , has met with problems from new observations of cold component which show that the terminal outflow speed depends on galactic properties like rotation speed @xcite.it has been proposed that these observations can be explained by radiation pressure driving the outflow @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that a natural course of events leading from a starburst would be a radiation pressure driven wind in the beginning , and ram pressure acting on it after a period of @xmath11 myr , the life time of massive stars @xcite .",
    "this scenario also naturally explains the puzzling fact that cold clouds are observed at large distances although their survival time - scales in the hot gas would have inhibited them from being pushed out to such distances .    in the face of two processes leading to outflows ,",
    "one wonders if both processes contribute equally , or if there are regimes in which one of these two processes dominate over the other . in this paper",
    "we present an analytical calculation for the dynamics of cold clouds taking into account both ram and radiation pressure and all sources of gravity , and compare our results with observations .",
    "we consider the dynamics of cold clouds ( @xmath12 k ) embedded in hot gas , in which the hot gas component exerts a drag force due to ram pressure .",
    "we also assume that dust grains in the cold clouds are strongly coupled to the gas , and therefore the dynamics of these clouds is also influenced by radiation pressure .",

    "we therefore solve the following equation for the momentum of the cold cloud ( p@xmath19 = m@xmath19v ) , see figure [ cloud ] ,    = m_c = f_ram + f_rad - f_grav [ one ] where m@xmath19 is the mass of the cloud and v is its velocity in z direction .",

    "the hot gas observed in x - rays and which is thought to provide the ram pressure , has temperatures in the range @xmath23 kev @xcite , which correspond to the isothermal sound speed @xmath24 km / s .",
    "current x - ray instruments can not detect the speed of this hot and tenuous material and hence the kinemetics of this hot phase is poorly constrained . if we assume it as an adiabatic wind passing through a sonic point , then @xmath25 , where @xmath26 @xcite , which gives @xmath27 . in this paper , we take v@xmath28 km s@xmath1 , which corresponds to @xmath29 and @xmath30 kev .",

    "we consider a mass loss rate of @xmath35 , which roughly corresponds to half - cone angle @xmath36 .",

    "next we solve the wind equation for a grid of sfr and galaxy circular speed values , for the cases of ram pressure and radiation pressure alone , and then for the combination of the two . in figure [ figcie ]",

    "wind velocity increases as one moves diagonally , from top left to the bottom right corner .",
    "we show two contours for @xmath114 with thin solid lines for ram and radiation pressure alone . for the case of combined ram and radiation pressure driving , we show two contours , for @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( upper and lower thick lines ) .",
    "we also show the data for outflows from a number of observations ( see caption for details ) .    in the case of only radiation pressure , the wind speed is found to be roughly proportional to sfr , which can be understood from the fact that @xmath117 .",
    "the case for only ram pressure appears to explain the wind in low mass galaxies .",
    "however , from the @xmath118 contour it is clear that ram pressure can not drive the cold clouds out of the galaxies with rotation speeds @xmath119 200 km / s , as we have seen in the previous section that for escaping winds one needs @xmath120 .",
    "this points to the existence of a critical rotation speed above which the physical mechanism of outflow changes .",
    "therefore outflows from galaxies with v@xmath121 km / s and sfr @xmath2 m@xmath63/yr are dominated by ram pressure and those from the more massive galaxies with larger sfr , are influenced more by radiation pressure .",
    "the most important result of our calculation is that galactic outflows require both ram and radiation pressure , especially for high mass and high sfr cases .",
    "our calculation has a number of ingredients from stellar physics and disk and halo parameters , and apart from the value of the hot wind speed @xmath32 , there is no free parameter in this calculation .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note that our theoretical results are consistent with most data of outflows when studied in the parameter space of @xmath80 and sfr .",
    "it is also interesting that a recent simulation with ram and radiation pressure driven outflows has concluded that these two processes are important in different mass regimes , although it is not clear where the dividing line between the two regimes lies @xcite .",
    "cold cloud outflows from galaxies on the left of the contours in figure [ figcie ] are unlikely to escape into the igm and likely get trapped in the circumgalactic region as observed by @xcite ( data shown by blue cross ) or fall back @xcite .",
    "although strictly speaking our calculation refers to cold clouds being driven out along the pole of the disk galaxies , and we can not infer the mass loss rate without doing a 2-d calculation , but we can speculate on the scaling of the mass loss rate with galactic mass by making some simple assumption .",
    "let us assume that the dynamics of cold clouds beyond the polar regions are similar to that along the pole .",
    "assuming a one - dimensional mass flow , the mass loss rate from the disk is approximately @xmath122 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the gas column density and @xmath123 is the scale length of the disk .",
    "we note that in the prescription of mmw98 , one has @xmath124 .",
    "we therefore have , @xmath125 , where we have used eqn [ eq : fit ] , after multiplying both sides by @xmath80 .",
    "the ratio of mass outflow rate to the sfr is therefore @xmath126 . using kennicutt s law of star formation , which gives @xmath127 , we have finally , @xmath128 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that roughly , @xmath129 interestingly , similar power law dependence has also been found in simulations @xcite .",
    "we note that our results assumed a value of @xmath130 km s@xmath1 , and a column density of cold clouds of @xmath131 cm@xmath9 .",
    "if we assume a larger value of @xmath32 ( @xmath132 km s@xmath1 ) , then the contour for only ram pressure will be able to explain the winds in uligs with large sfr and high mass . a similar result will follow from larger values of @xmath54 for the radiation pressure case .",
    "it is interesting to note that the contour for only radiation pressure can explain the ulig region of figure [ figcie ] ( top right corner ) . extending to larger sfr , our results indicate that radiation pressure will also be important for hligs ( hyperluminous infra - red galaxies ) @xcite .",
    "lastly , although it may appear that the role of radiation pressure in galaxies other than uligs is less dominant than ram pressure as far as energetics is concerned , radiation pressure may still play an important role in lifting the clouds to a large height before it is embedded in the hot wind to help it survive long @xcite .",
    "we have studied the outflows from disk galaxies driven by ram and radiation pressure and compared the theoretical results with data in the parameter space of galaxy circular speed and sfr .",
    "we found that the driving mechanism of escaping wind is different in low mass and high mass galaxies , with radiation pressure being important for high mass galaxies with high sfr .",
    "our results are also consistent with recently observed circumgalactic gas .",
