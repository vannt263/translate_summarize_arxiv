    "extrasolar planets which transit their host stars ( transiting extrasolar planets , or teps ) provide a unique opportunity to determine the bulk physical properties ( mass , radius and average density ) of planetary bodies outside the solar system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the more than 90 such planets that have been announced to date",
    ", it has become apparent that gas giant planets more massive than @xmath22 exhibit a wide range of radii ( from @xmath23 for corot-13b , @xcite , to @xmath24 for wasp-12b , @xcite ) . below this mass",
    "fewer planets are known ; however the seven known teps with masses similar to saturn ( @xmath25 ; the mass of saturn is @xmath26@xmath14 , @xcite ) also appear to have diverse bulk properties .",
    "two of these teps have densities much less than that of saturn ( hat - p-12b and wasp-21b both have @xmath27@xmath19 , while saturn has @xmath28@xmath19 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , three have densities that are somewhat less than that of saturn ( kepler-9b and kepler-9c have densities of @xmath29@xmath19  and @xmath30@xmath19  respectively , @xcite ; and wasp-29b has @xmath31@xmath19 , @xcite ) , and two have densities that are greater than that of saturn ( hd  149026b has @xmath32@xmath19 , @xcite ; and corot-8b has @xmath33@xmath19 , @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred core masses of these planets also differ dramatically , with the two low - density planets having negligible cores of @xmath34 , the three intermediate - density planets having cores that are perhaps several tens of earth masses , and the two high - density planets having cores that represent a substantial fraction of their respective masses .",
    "the inferred core masses of planets in this mass range appear to correlate with the metallicity of the host star .",
    "the two low density planets orbit stars with sub - solar metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath35 for hat - p-12 , and [ fe / h]@xmath36 for wasp-21 ) , while the five higher density planets orbit stars with super - solar metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath37 for corot-8 , [ fe / h]@xmath38 for hd  149026 , [ fe / h]@xmath39 for wasp-29 , and [ fe / h]@xmath40 for kepler-9 ) .",
    "this has been taken as suggestive evidence for the core - accretion scenario for planet formation @xcite .    in this work we present the discovery of two new low - density planets with masses comparable to that of saturn .",
