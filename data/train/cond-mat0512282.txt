    "attention is increasing toward adhesion and wetting , the structure and physics of solid - liquid interfaces especially at high temperatures , and the structure of liquid surfaces , particularly of complex and molecular systems . in order to gain more insight into these problems ,",
    "there is a strong need for good case studies , to use as well - understood starting points .",
    "one easy starting point is to study the contact of a liquid with _ its own _ solid , a clear situation where there will be no ambiguity of physical description , no uncertainty in chemical composition , no segregation phenomena , all of them complications present in the study of contact between different substances .",
    "contact of a liquid with the surface of its own solid usually materializes spontaneously at high temperature .",
    "most solid surfaces are known to wet themselves spontaneously with an atomically thin film of melt , when their temperature @xmath0 is brought close enough to the melting point  of the solid .",
    "the phenomenon whereby the thickness @xmath1 of the liquid film diverges continuously ( and critically ) as @xmath2 , is commonly referred to as ( complete ) surface melting  @xcite .",
    "surface melting is indeed a very natural thing to happen , because it corresponds to complete wetting of a solid substrate by the same identical substance , only in liquid form .",
    "another name for surface melting , better suited for the fluid community  @xcite , could be complete interfacial wetting . due to surface melting , a solid with free surfaces",
    "can not generally be overheated above its thermodynamical bulk . the free energy barrier for the passage from solid to liquid generally requires nucleation and implies hysteresis .",
    "although this is not generally observable for reasons exposed below , it should be theoretically possible to overheat a solid , at least insofar as one can exclude the presence of defects that could act as nucleation centers .    in the melting phase transition ,",
    "the solid surface itself represents a ( nearly ) ubiquitous defect that continuously nucleates the liquid , thus usually preventing overheating of the solid .",
    "a generic crystal surface simply does not remain solid at high temperature , and spontaneously wets itself with a liquid film of increasing thickness very close to the melting point .",
    "the thermodynamical condition for surface melting , or complete interfacial wetting , to occur , is that the solid - vapor ( sv ) interface should turn itself spontaneously into the solid - liquid ( sl ) plus liquid - vapor ( lv ) interface pair , or : @xmath3 where the @xmath4 s are interface free energies at the triple point .",
    "there are a number of known exceptions to this behavior . on some solid surfaces",
    "the liquid film does begin to form upon heating , but its thickness levels off to a finite value instead of diverging as @xmath5 ( so - called blocked or incomplete  @xcite surface melting ) .",
    "more remarkably , some other solid surfaces remain dry and fully crystalline up to the bulk triple point . this _ surface non - melting _",
    "phenomenon , originally discovered in molecular dynamics simulations of au(111 )  @xcite and independently observed experimentally in pb(111 )  @xcite , takes place at the close - packed faces of several metals , such as al(111 )  @xcite .",
    "thermodynamically , surface non - melting will occur if there is a free energy loss in converting the sv interface into the sl plus lv interfaces pair , namely @xmath6    in that case , the liquid will wet the solid at best _ incompletely_. a liquid droplet deposited in full equilibrium on the solid surface will not spontaneously spread .",

    "alkali halides are our natural prototype choice , because they represent a well defined class of substances whose liquids do not wet their own solid , and because they have otherwise long been studied experimentally and theoretically .",
    "molten salts and their surfaces were extensively investigated by macroscopic techniques  @xcite . a partial wetting angle @xmath10= 48@xmath11",
    "is known for liquid nacl on nacl(100 ) at the melting point  = 1074 k ( and similar results also hold for other alkali halides )  @xcite .",
    "such a large angle underlines a strikingly poor wetting of the liquid onto its own solid , large by comparison with other known cases .",
    "for example , @xmath1215@xmath11 is observed for liquid pb / pb(111 )  @xcite , or @xmath13 is obtained by simulation of au / au(111 )  @xcite .",
    "should liquid surface layering be , as was the case in metals , the culprit in nacl too , the layering magnitude and its effect should indeed be exceptionally strong , and amenable to experimental verification .",
    "several simulations on alkali halide liquids suggest instead that there is no layering whatsoever  @xcite .",
    "a second possible mechanism leading to surface non - melting may arise from van der waals forces .",
    "whenever the melt is optically more dense than the solid , the so - called hamaker constant @xmath14 governing the effective sl - lv interface interaction @xmath15 may turn negative .",
    "the resulting attraction impedes complete melting , as is the case for valence semiconductors such as silicon  @xcite .",
    "however , liquid nacl is 26% less dense than the solid , and here the hamaker constant is certainly positive  @xcite .    that leaves the question of explaining the exceptionally poor wetting of nacl(100 ) by liquid nacl completely open . in order to shed light on this question and on the underlying physics",

    "finally the solid - liquid interface free energy @xmath18 will be calculated via young s equation from a direct simulation of partial wetting of a liquid droplet on the solid surface at the melting point .",
    "the resulting large value of @xmath19 is connected to the large density jump . in the concluding discussion",
    ", it is argued that all three separate physical mechanisms that conspire to give rise to poor wetting , by lowering @xmath16 and simultaneously raising @xmath17 and @xmath18 eventually stem from charge order and charge neutrality of this ionic system .",

    "the nacl(100 ) surface remained crystalline in a metastable state for at least 200 ps . in this overheated surface regime , solid nacl(100 ) was found to possess a thick nucleation barrier against melting up to about  = 1115  k @xmath33  + 50  k , in the following sense . when a thin surface film consisting of @xmath34 atomic layers was artificially melted , and then let evolve to equilibrium at a grid of temperatures @xmath0 @xmath35 , the melted film was seen to spontaneously recrystallize for @xmath36 , with @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",

    "that indicates that in this temperature range the overheated solid slab is locally stable , with a free energy barrier against overall melting  @xcite .    above , overheating of crystalline nacl(100 ) persisted until a higher `` surface spinodal temperature '' @xmath39 1215  k @xmath39 + 150  k , now however with only a thin nucleation barrier @xmath40 of a monolayer .",
    "only at , as high as 150  k above , does solid nacl(100 ) become locally unstable and melt spontaneously .",
    "we find the pronounced metastability of this solid surface to persist at least up to , or @xmath33 50  k above  even in presence of common surface defects , such as molecular vacancies or steps .",

    "of course , the solid surface will sublime very strongly at these temperatures .",
    "the experimental equilibrium vapor pressure of nacl at  is 0.345 mmhg , a large value . as a consequence",
    ", surface vacancies will form and surface steps will flow due to evaporation ( and to re - condensation when working at solid - vapor equilibrium ) .",
    "we note that the time scale for this kind of surface evolution is a much slower one than that addressed here",

    "this indicates a typical evaporation time many orders of magnitude larger than our typical simulation time .",
    "that explains why in practice we never even observed in simulation a spontaneous evaporation event off the solid surface .",
    "this however does not invalidate the significance of the simulation results . at",
    "any given instant of a realistically long time evolution of nacl(100 ) , there will be of course molecular evaporation and step flow , but that will still leave defect free terraces much larger on average than those we simulated .",
    "these terraces will be fully crystalline even well above , displaying precisely the microscopic non - melting behavior described above .",
    "these considerations however suggest that surface non - melting in alkali halides could not easily be pursued with static or nearly static experimental probes , because sublimation and condensation will influence and possibly spoil the outcome .",

    "we simulated for this purpose a 2880 molecule bulk system and independently a slab comprising 1440 molecules and an equivalent volume of vacuum .",

    "we did not explicitly include quantum freezing effects at low temperatures , because they represent a small correction in comparison with large thermal effects at the melting point .",
    "nevertheless since quantum freezing takes place at temperatures @xmath52 , ( @xmath53 is the debye temperature ) , we started integration at @xmath54 which is @xmath39 50  k for nacl , therefore using the @xmath0 = 50  k state as a reference . @xmath55 the bulk and slab internal energies as a function of temperature , are shown in fig .",
    "[ int1 ] . after integration , the difference between slab and bulk free energies per unit surface area ( accounting the presence of two surfaces ) equals the surface energy .",

    "upon increasing temperature , there is an important thermal drop of the surface free energy , especially fast for , indicating considerable additional anharmonicity of the solid surface relative to bulk solid nacl .",
    "a good question is what part of that anharmonicity can be ascribed to temperature - dependent effectively harmonic vibrations , and what can not .    to judge on that",

    "the vibrational spectra are obtained as : @xmath58 by treating both the bulk and the slab spectra as a collection of harmonic oscillators , we obtained an effective surface vibrational free energy by subtracting their respective harmonic free energies off one another , and dividing the outcome by two , for two surfaces .    for increasing temperatures ,",
    "the surface component of the slab spectra displays a stronger anharmonic softening than the bulk .",
    "this as anticipated gives rise to an `` effective harmonic '' drop of surface free energy , as shown by dots in fig .",
    "we conclude that whereas about half the total anharmonic free energy decrease can be ascribed to the effective surface vibrational free energy and in particular to the surface frequency softening with temperature , the remaining half can not be accounted for in this way , representing `` hard '' anharmonicity .    in conclusion the surface free energy of nacl(100 )",
    "approximately halves its value from @xmath33  206  mj / m@xmath44 at 50  k to @xmath33  100  mj / m@xmath44 at .",
    "such a large decrease of the already unusually small low-@xmath0 surface energy results in an exceptionally stable solid surface . while the physical reason for a low surface energy at low-@xmath0 is clearly the perfect charge ordering , that for its large thermal decrease is the ability of rocksalt and of its surface to sustain exceptionally large anharmonic vibrations without loss of mechanical stability .",

    "the occasional molecular evaporation or condensation events were very quickly `` forgotten '' in the chaotic liquid surface dynamics . in this regime",
    "they therefore do not appear to affect at all the overall liquid surface behavior .",
    "this allows us to neglect our lack of an evaporation / condensation statistics , in that its inclusion would not alter the liquid surface properties to be extracted by the simulation .",
