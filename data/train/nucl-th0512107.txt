    "the slowing down and coulomb capture of the negative particle @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in hydrogen media lead to the formation of the @xmath7-molecular complex the decay of which results in the exotic atom formation in highly excited states with the principal quantum number @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the reduced mass of the exotic atom .",
    "their initial @xmath11-population and kinetic energy distribution of the exotic atom are defined by the competition of different decay modes of this complex .",
    "the further destiny of the exotic atom depends on the kinetics of the processes occurring in the deexcitation cascade .",
    "the experimental data are mainly appropriate to the last stage of the atomic cascade , such as x - ray yields and the products of the weak or strong interaction of the exotic particle in the low angular momentum states with hydrogen isotopes .",
    "hadronic hydrogen atoms are of special interest among exotic atoms because they have the simplest structure and are the probe in the investigations of the various aspects of both the exotic atom physics and the elementary hadron - nucleon interactions at zero energy .",
    "in particular , in order to analyze the precision spectroscopy experimental data  @xcite the kinetic energy distribution must be taken into account .",
    "the velocity of the exotic hydrogen atom plays an important role due to the effect of the stark transitions on the l x - rays yields and the doppler broadening of the l - lines owing to the preceding coulomb deexcitation transitions .",
    "the energy release in the last process leads to an acceleration of colliding partners .",
    "so the reliable theoretical backgrounds on the processes both in low - lying and in highly excited states are required for the detailed and proper analysis of these data .",
    "in this paper we present the first step to _ ab initio _ quantum - mechanical treatment of non - reactive scattering processes of the excited antiprotonic hydrogen atom in collisions with the hydrogenic atom in the ground state :    * elastic scattering @xmath12 * stark mixing @xmath13 * coulomb deexcitation @xmath14    here @xmath15 are hydrogen isotopes and @xmath16 ; @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 are the principal and orbital quantum numbers of the exotic and hydrogenic atom , respectively .",
    "the processes ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) decelerate and accelerate while the coulomb deexcitation ( 3 ) accelerates the exotic atoms , influencing their quantum number and energy distributions during the cascade .",
    "the last process has attracted particular attention especially after the `` hot '' @xmath19 atoms with the kinetic energy up to 200 ev were found experimentally@xcite . due to the similarity of the general features of the exotic atoms",
    "the coulomb deexcitation process must be also taken into account for the other exotic atoms .",
    "starting from the classical paper by leon and bethe  [ 3 ] , stark transitions have been treated in the semiclassical straight - line trajectory approximation ( see [ 4 ] and references therein ) .",
    "the first fully quantum - mechanical treatment of the processes ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) based on the adiabatic description was given in [ 5 - 8 ] .",
    "recently@xcite the elastic scattering and stark transitions ( for @xmath20 ) have also been studied in a close - coupling approach treating the interaction of the exotic hydrogen atom with the hydrogenic one in the dipole approximation with electron screening taken into account by the model . as for higher exotic atom states",
    "@xmath21 , the semiclassical approach  @xcite is used for the description of these processes .    as concerning the acceleration process ( 3 ) in the muonic and hadronic hydrogen atoms ,",
    "the parameterization based on the calculations in the semiclassical model  @xcite ( see also [ 13 ] ) is used for the low - lying states ( @xmath22 ) and the results of the classical - trajectory monte carlo model  @xcite are used for higher exotic atom states in the cascade calculations .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to obtain the cross sections of the processes ( 1)-(3 ) for the excited antiprotonic atom beginning from the low collision energies in the framework of the fully quantum - mechanical approach . for this purpose the unified treatment of the elastic scattering ,",
    "stark transitions and coulomb deexcitation within the close - coupling method has been used .",
    "this approach has been recently applied for the study of the differential and total cross sections of the elastic scattering , stark transitions and coulomb deexcitation in the collisions of the excited muonic  @xcite and pionic  @xcite hydrogen atoms with the hydrogen ones . in the following section we briefly describe the close - coupling formalism .",
    "the results of the close - coupling calculations concerning the total cross sections of the processes ( 1)-(3 ) are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "finally , summary and concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "the total wave function @xmath23 of the four - body system @xmath24 satisfies the time independent schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian which after separating the center of mass motion can be written as @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the reduced mass of the system ) .",
    "here we use the set of jacobi coordinates @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the radius - vectors of the nuclei , muon and electron in the lab - system and @xmath30 are the center of mass radius - vectors of hydrogen and exotic atoms , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the free exotic and hydrogen atoms , respectively , satisfy the schrdinger equations @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the hydrogen - like wave functions of the exotic atom and hydrogen atom bound states , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the corresponding eigenvalues . in the present study @xmath36 includes beyond the standard non - relativistic two - body coulomb problem the energy shifts due to the strong interaction , vacuum polarization and finite size .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that in order to treat the hadronic @xmath6 states as normal asymptotic states in the scattering problem we take into consideration only the real part of the complex strong interaction energy shift .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath38 includes the two - body coulomb interactions between the particles from two colliding subsystems : @xmath39 where the following notations are used : @xmath40 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the masses of hydrogen isotopes , antiproton and electron , respectively ) .",
    "atomic units ( a.u ) @xmath43 will be used throughout the paper unless otherwise stated .",
    "+ in this paper , as well as in the previous studies [ 11 , 12 - 15 ] , we assume that the state of the target electron is fixed during the collision .",
    "the electron excitations can be taken into account in a straightforward manner . in a space - fixed coordinate frame",
    "we built the basis states from the eigenvectors of the operators @xmath44 and the total parity @xmath45 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 here the orbital angular momentum @xmath50 of @xmath51 is coupled with the orbital momentum @xmath52 of the relative motion to give the total angular momentum , @xmath53 .",
    "the explicit form of the radial hydrogen - like wave functions @xmath54 will be given below .",
    "then , for the fixed values of @xmath55 the exact solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath56 is expanded as follows @xmath57 where the @xmath58 are the radial functions of the relative motion and the sum is restricted by the @xmath59 values to satisfy the total parity conservation .",

    "1 ) the stark transitions both from the @xmath6-states and to the @xmath6-state at the same collisional energy are strongly suppressed at the kinetic energies above the threshold .",
    "the similar effect is also observed for the elastic @xmath145 transitions .",
    "the other transitions are practically unchangeable at fixed energy .",
    "the analog of this effect can be modeled by excluding @xmath6-states from the basis states . at energy above a few thresholds the effect is much weaker .",
    "therefore , the strong interaction effect in the antiprotonic hydrogen ( the similar effect must be also observed in the kaonic hydrogen atom ) results in the essential and important difference of the stark transition role in the absorption from the @xmath6 states in contrast to pionic hydrogen atoms .",
    "the influence of the strong interaction shift enhances for the lower states and becomes less pronounced for the highly excited states of the antiprotonic atom .",

    "the special features of these cross sections are the following : the similar energy dependence but sharper than that of the elastic scattering and stark transitions ( see also in fig .",
    "4 ) ; the contribution of the transitions with @xmath151 is comparable with the one for @xmath150 = 1 and approximately equal about 50% .",
    "the effect of the @xmath6 state energy shifts in the @xmath1-averaged coulomb deexcitation cross sections are small for the same reason as it was discussed above ( due to small statistical weight of the ns - state ) . in fig .",
    "4 we also compare our results with those obtained in the semiclassical model ( we use the parameterization suggested in [ 13 ] which gives a fair description of the coulomb cross sections from [ 11 ] ) for the @xmath150 = 1 transition .",
    "the satisfactory agreement is observed , but this agreement is quite occasional and takes no place for other @xmath141 values .",
    "the distribution over the final states @xmath152 is completely different from the semiclassical results [ 11 ] as it was illustrated in fig .",
    "the present calculations predict that @xmath153 transitions give a substantial contribution to the coulomb deexcitation of the highly excited antiprotonic hydrogen atom that is in agreement with our previous results for the muonic and pionic hydrogen  [ 14,15 ] atoms .",
    "the unified treatment of the elastic scattering , stark transitions and coulomb deexcitation is presented in _ ab initio _ quantum - mechanical approach and for the first time the cross sections of these processes have been calculated for the highly excited antiprotonic hydrogen atom .",
    "the influence of the energy shifts of the @xmath6 states on these processes has been studied .",
    "we have found that strong interaction shifts in the antiprotonic hydrogen atom lead to substantial suppression of both the @xmath154 and @xmath155 transitions . at the same time",
    "the cross sections of the elastic scattering and stark transitions for the the states with @xmath156 are practically unchangeable .",
