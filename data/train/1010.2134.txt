    "cosmological phase transitions generically produce cosmic relics such as topological defects @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , baryon number asymmetries @xcite , inhomogeneities @xcite , and gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the walls of expanding bubbles usually play a relevant role in the mechanisms which generate these relics . indeed , most of them depend on the disturbance produced by the motion of bubble walls in the surrounding plasma . moreover , the wall velocity itself depends on such hydrodynamics @xcite as well as on the friction with the plasma @xcite .",
    "the friction is determined by microphysics , i.e. , the interactions of particles with the wall .",
    "the hydrodynamics is determined by the relativistic fluid equations .",
    "the latent heat that is injected at the phase transition fronts spreads out , causing reheating and bulk motions of the plasma .",
    "there are essentially three propagation modes for the phase transition front . a detonation , which is supersonic and is followed by a rarefaction wave , a subsonic deflagration , which is preceded by a shock front , and a supersonic deflagration , which is preceded by a shock and followed by a rarefaction wave .",
    "several of the mechanisms which generate the aforementioned cosmological relics operate when bubbles meet .",
    "for instance , in order to produce gravity waves ( gws ) , bubbles must collide and lose their spherical symmetry , since a spherical source can not generate gravitational radiation .",
    "the hydrodynamics of colliding bubble walls is complicated .",
    "the fluid velocity and temperature profiles during bubble collisions were studied using numerical simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a few configurations for the collision of shock fronts were considered analytically .",
    "both studies were performed in 1 + 1 dimensions . in applications ,",
    "further simplifications are needed .",
    "for instance , in the case of gravitational waves , the relevant quantity is the energy that is injected into bulk motions of the plasma .",
    "this is parameterized by the efficiency factor @xmath0 , which is defined as the ratio of the kinetic energy in bulk motions to the released vacuum energy . in calculations of @xmath0 ,",
    "the interaction between bubbles is neglected , and spherical bubbles are assumed . this treatment implies two hypothesis , namely , that the motion of a bubble wall is not affected by the perturbations other bubbles caused in the plasma , and that the deformation of the bubble wall does not affect the energy transfer from the wall to the plasma .",
    "the first assumption should be correct for supersonic walls , which either do not have shock fronts preceding them or the shock fronts are very close to the walls . for subsonic walls ,",
    "the main influence from other bubbles is the reheating of the plasma .",
    "this effect must be taken into account in a complete calculation of the phase transition @xcite . regarding the dependence on the wall geometry",
    ", some progress can be made by comparing different bubble symmetries .",
    "of course , after a few collisions bubbles will take arbitrary forms .",
    "nevertheless , considering a few specific symmetries will be useful to tell whether the disturbance of the fluid has a strong dependence on the wall geometry or not .",
    "furthermore , it is particularly important to study the case of planar walls , for which analytical results can be obtained .    the growth of plane , cylindrical , and spherical bubbles ( equivalently , bubbles in 1 , 2 , and 3 spatial dimensions , respectively ) was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of deflagrations .",
    "the fluid velocity profiles are quite different .",
    "in particular , for planar walls the shock wave preceding the phase transition front has a constant fluid velocity , whereas in the cylindrical and spherical cases the fluid velocity falls quickly in front of the wall .",
    "this is because in higher dimensions there is more room for the shock wave to carry away the injected energy .",
    "nevertheless , the total amount of kinetic energy of the fluid must be a fraction of the released latent heat ( another fraction goes into thermal energy ) , and there is no reason for this fraction ( and for the ratio @xmath0 ) to have a strong dependence on the bubble wall geometry .",
    "for planar walls , the velocity profile of the fluid can be obtained analytically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and one expects to find analytical formulas for quantities such as the efficiency factor as well .",
    "an analytical approximation for @xmath0 was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for small wall velocities .",
    "recently , the efficiency factor was calculated numerically for spherical bubbles @xcite in the whole wall velocity range .    in this paper",
    "we address the issue of the effect of the wall geometry on the disturbance caused by the motion of the walls .",
    "thus , we study the hydrodynamics of spherical , cylindrical , and planar bubble walls .",
    "in particular , we show that the efficiency factor does not differ significantly between the different wall geometries . for planar walls ,",
    "we obtain the efficiency factor analytically for any wall velocity .",
    "we also discuss the generation of gws in the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "in the next section we review the dynamics of the first - order phase transition . in section [ fluid ]",
    "we calculate the fluid profiles and the efficiency factor for the three bubble symmetries . in section [ planar ]",
    "we study in detail the case of planar walls .",
    "we discuss the different hydrodynamical modes and we derive analytical formulas for @xmath0 . in section",
    "[ gw ] we apply our results to the estimation of the gravitational wave signal from the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the conclusions are in section [ conclu ] .",
    "a cosmological phase transition occurs when the free energy of the model ( i.e. , the finite - temperature effective potential ) depends on an order parameter @xmath1 ( e.g. , a higgs field ) , such that the free energy density @xmath2 has a minimum @xmath3 at high temperatures , and a different minimum @xmath4 at low temperatures ( we shall use a `` @xmath5 '' index for variables in the high - temperature phase and a `` @xmath6 '' index for the low - temperature phase ) . for a first - order phase transition , there is a temperature range in which the two minima coexist and a barrier in the free energy separates them .",

    "it is useful to consider a simplified model which exhibits the general features of a phase transition .",
    "this allows in particular to obtain results which depend on a few parameters .",
    "then , the results can be applied to realistic phase transitions by calculating these parameters in specific models .",

    "in fact , the `` bubble collisions '' mechanism @xcite is based on the envelope approximation @xcite , which consists of taking into account only the motion of the uncollided walls .",
    "the thickness of the shell in which the energy of the fluid is concentrated is relevant for this mechanism , and the envelope approximation assumes that the energy concentrations are infinitesimally thin . on the other hand , at a cosmological phase transition the reynolds number is large enough for bubble collisions to cause the onset of turbulence @xcite .",
    "turbulence turns out to be a more effective source of gravitational radiation than bubble collisions @xcite . in",
    "an electrically conducting fluid and in the presence of magnetic fields , turbulence develops in a completely different way .",
    "this gives a third mechanism for generation of gws in a phase transition ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the energy density of gravitational radiation is usually expressed in terms of the quantity @xmath319 where @xmath320 is the energy density of the gws , @xmath321 is the frequency , and @xmath322 is the critical energy density today , @xmath323 , with @xmath324 .",
    "the gw spectrum depends on the details of the phase transition and on the generating mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , the peak frequency @xmath325 is generally determined by the typical length scale of the source . in a first - order phase transition ,",

    "we see that the phase transition needs not be too strong , i.e. , with @xmath349 we obtain intensities above the peak sensitivity of lisa .",

    "@xcite , the value of the jouguet detonation efficiency factor @xmath354 is underestimated in the literature , due to a missing factor @xmath355 in the original paper @xcite .",
    "this mistake compensates the fact that @xmath354 is larger than the efficiency factor @xmath356 for weak detonations .",
    "the effect of this compensation on the intensity of gws is shown in fig .",
    "[ figjougweak ] , where we plotted @xmath337 as a function of @xmath344 for @xmath357 , together with the correct ( upper dashed line ) and the wrong ( lower dashed line ) values for the jouguet detonation case .",
    "the efficiency factor for weak detonations lies between these two values .",
    "notice , also , that supersonic deflagrations give the largest gw amplitudes , and that even subsonic deflagrations can give intensities comparable to those of detonations .",
    "we have studied the motion of phase transition fronts in a first - order cosmological phase transition , focusing on the energy injected into bulk motions of the plasma , which is a relevant quantity for the generation of cosmological relics such as gravitational waves .",
    "this issue was recently addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of spherical bubbles . however , the gws are generated once the bubbles ( or the shock fronts ) collide , so that the spherical symmetry is lost .",
    "therefore , any bubble symmetry one may assume will be just an approximation . in order to study the dependence on the wall geometry , we have considered bubble walls with spherical , cylindrical , and plane symmetry , for all the possible hydrodynamic propagation modes , namely , subsonic deflagrations , supersonic deflagrations , and detonations .",
    "we have seen that the region around the wall in which the energy spreads can be rather different for each wall geometry . in particular , for planar walls the region is larger , since the energy spreads in only one direction . for the strongest processes allowed , i.e. , jouguet deflagrations and jouguet detonations , the kinetic energy of the fluid is , for the three geometries , concentrated in a thin region around the wall .",
    "this is because these processes produce a stronger disturbance of the plasma than weak processes ; thus , the injected energy is larger and , hence , more difficult to distribute .",
    "the efficiency factor @xmath0 , i.e. , the part of the injected energy which goes into bulk motions ( relative to the released vacuum energy ) , has a rather weak dependence on the wall geometry .",
    "this is an important result , since the walls can take arbitrary forms after colliding .",
    "the dependence on the wall geometry is stronger for small wall velocities , @xmath358 . for small velocities ,",
    "however , the efficiency factor is small and will not play a relevant role in the cosmological consequences of the phase transition .",
    "thus , it is clear that , for applications , it is convenient to consider planar walls , for which we have obtained exact analytical expressions for @xmath0 ( alternatively , one can use the numerical fits given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the spherical case ) .",
    "the efficiency factor peaks for supersonic deflagrations , which are jouguet processes .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is in general sizeable for fast ( close to the speed of sound ) subsonic deflagrations , and for the slowest detonations , i.e. , those solutions which are close to the jouguet velocity . on the other hand , @xmath0 can decrease considerably for fast detonations , and vanishes for @xmath359 .",
    "we have applied the results for the planar case to the estimation of the gravitational wave signal from turbulence at the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the gw amplitude peaks for supersonic deflagrations .",
    "it is interesting to notice that subsonic deflagrations can give efficiency factors larger than those given by detonations .",
    "although the amplitude of the gravity waves may depend ( according to the generation mechanism ) on the wall velocity as well as on the efficiency factor , we have seen that subsonic deflagrations can produce gws of intensity comparable to that of detonations .",

    "<S> however , spherical bubbles are often considered in the literature , in particular for the calculation of gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> we study the steady state motion of bubble walls for different bubble symmetries . using the bag equation of state </S>",

    "<S> we consider the cases of spherical , cylindrical and planar walls , and compare the energy transferred to bulk motions of the relativistic fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the different wall geometries give similar perturbations of the plasma . </S>",
