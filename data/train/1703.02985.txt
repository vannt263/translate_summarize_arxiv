    "in the last decade , much progress has been made in narrowing down the epoch of cosmological reionization to be between @xmath17 ( ly@xmath8  saturation in z @xmath14 6 quasar , * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath18 ( polarization of cmb photons , * ? ? ? * ) . in between , quasars , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , and galaxies at @xmath19 6",
    "are important to constrain the nature of reionization .",
    "however , the rarity of high-@xmath20 quasars ( with only one known at @xmath19 7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and of high-@xmath20 grbs with rapid followup , limit their application as reionization probes .",
    "in contrast , hundreds of galaxies at @xmath19 6 have been reported from ground - based narrowband ly@xmath8  line searches ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , from space - based broadband lyman break searches ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and from newly taken space - based grism spectroscopic surveys @xcite .",
    "their luminosities , number densities , clustering , and ionizing powers are essential to probe the epoch of reionization ( _ eor _ ) .    because ly@xmath8  photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , ly@xmath8 emitters ( laes ) provide a sensitive , practical , and powerful tool to determine the epoch , duration , and inhomogeneities of reionization . with a sample of laes in _ eor _ , the easiest ly@xmath8  reionization test is the luminosity function ( lf ) test .",
    "@xcite first applied this test at @xmath20 = 5.7 , then at 6.5 @xcite .",
    "subsequent surveys have confirmed and refined the @xmath20 = 6.56.6 neutral fraction measurement to @xmath13 @xmath21 0.3 @xcite , and have found a significant neutral fraction increase from z = 6.6 to z = 7.3 @xcite .",
    "other implementations of ly@xmath8  reionization tests include the ly@xmath8  visibility test @xcite , i.e. , the ly@xmath8  fraction in lbgs in eor , the volume test ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rhoads & malhotra 2017 , in prep . ) , i.e. , each ly@xmath8  galaxy is taken as evidence for a certain volume of ionized gas , and the clustering test , e.g. , the signature of a patchy partially - ionized igm is sought by looking for excess spatial correlations in the ly@xmath8  galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "redshift @xmath22 is the frontier in ly@xmath8  and re - ionization studies .",
    "many searches for laes at z = 6.97.0 @xcite , z = 7.27.3 @xcite , and z = 7.7 @xcite have yielded @xmath14 two dozen narrowband - selected candidates , but only 3 of these have been spectroscopically confirmed so far @xcite . in comparison ,",

    "* ) , and a large fraction of them have been spectroscopically confirmed ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "the comoving volumes of the searches for @xmath19 7 laes are all less than 5@xmath24 cmpc@xmath25 , and some of the surveys with 200  wide filters in the far - red inevitably include one or two weak oh emission lines , limiting their sensitivity .",
    "thus , there is an urgent need for a systematic survey at z @xmath26 with sufficient volume and depth to determine if the ly@xmath8 line is attenuated due to neutral igm in a statistically significant way .    in this _ letter _ , we report the discovery of a population of candidate @xmath0 7 ly@xmath8  emitters in the first field ( cosmos ) of the lyman - alpha galaxies in the epoch of reionization ( lager ) survey . with lager - cosmos",

    "we present the candidates and their ly@xmath8  lf at @xmath0 7 . in   4 , we discuss the implications of these discoveries for _ eor _ at @xmath0 7 .",
    "the lager survey is the largest narrowband survey yet for laes at @xmath19 7 . it is currently ongoing , using the dark energy camera ( decam , with fov @xmath14 3 deg@xmath1 ) on the noao - ctio 4 m blanco telescope together with an optimally designed custom narrowband filter nb964 ( central wavelength @xmath14 9642 , fwhm @xmath14 90 ) .",
    "lager is designed to select more than a hundred z@xmath147 laes over an area of 12 deg@xmath1 in 4 fields ( @xmath27 @xmath28 ) .",
    "currently , lager has collected 47 hrs nb964 narrowband imaging in 3 fields ( cdf - s , cosmos , and dls - f5 ) taken during 9 nights in 2015 december , 2016 february , march and november .",
    "the deepest nb964 imaging is done in cosmos , where we have obtained 34 hours nb964 exposure in a 3 deg@xmath1 field .",
    "the exposure time per nb964 frame is 900s .",
    "consecutive exposures were dithered by @xmath29 so that chip gaps and bad pixels do not lead to blank areas in the final stacks .",

    "the zero - magnitudes of the decam images were calibrated to the subaru suprime - cam broadband magnitudes of the stars in the public cosmos / ultravista @xmath31-selected catalog @xcite .",

    "the narrowband nb964 aperture magnitudes corresponding to the 80% , 50% and 30% completeness fractions are 24.2 , 25.0 , and 25.3 , respectively .      since subaru broadband images are deeper and have better seeings than the decam broadband images , we only apply selection criteria for z @xmath14 7 laes in the central 2-deg@xmath1 area covered by both suprime - cam and decam .",
    "the selection criteria for @xmath0 7 laes include narrowband nb964 with @xmath465-@xmath33 detection ( nb@xmath47 @xmath48 nb@xmath49 ) , narrowband nb964 excess over broadband z ( z - nb964 @xmath50 1.0 ) , and non - detections in both decam @xmath51 and suprime - cam @xmath52 , n711 , n816 , n921 bands .",
    "we specially exclude broadband detections in the 1.08 ( 4 pixel ) diameter aperture to exclude marginal signals in these bands .",

    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : f-4 ] shows the evolution of luminosity densities both for @xmath67 and uv photons .",
    "compared to lbgs ( yellow shaded region ) , an accelerated evolution of lae @xmath67 densities from z = 6.6 ( green diamonds ) to z = 7.3 ( purple cross ) , as reported by @xcite , is clearly seen in figure [ fig : f-4 ] . since uv photons detected in lbgs are insensitive to the neutral hydrogen in eor , @xcite concluded that such rapid evolution in lae lfs can be attributed to a large neutral igm fraction at @xmath0 7.3 .",
    "our lager survey shows rapid evolution from @xmath2 6.6 to 6.9 , and a much smaller difference between @xmath2 6.9 and 7.3 ( see figure [ fig : f-4 ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the evolution in the neutral fraction accelerated after @xmath16 , though a smooth , monotonic neutral fraction evolution @xmath68 also fits the lager results and @xcite measurements within their uncertainties .",
    "note that the cosmic time from @xmath0 6.6 to 6.9 and from @xmath0 6.9 to 7.3 are approximately equal , which is about 50 myr .",
    "furthermore , compared to the evolution of ly@xmath8  densities @xmath69 between redshifts of 5.7 and 6.9 , the evolution in the bright end only @xmath70 follows a much smoother trend , somehow similar to but still steeper than the uv densities of lbgs ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : f-4 ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that either the intrinsic lae lf evolves moderately between z=5.7 and 6.9 , or igm attenuation plays a role even at the highest luminosity bin .",
    "consequently , the dramatic and rapid evolution between @xmath2 6.6 and 6.9 in the faint end can be mainly attributed to the change of neutral igm fraction .",
    "this is also consistent with the spectroscopic ly@xmath8   visibility test , where lbgs at @xmath0 7 show a large drop in the fraction of visible ly@xmath8  lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )      following @xcite and @xcite , we compare the ly@xmath8  luminosity densities at @xmath2 6.9 ( in eor ) and at @xmath2 5.7 ( when reionization is completed ) to estimate the effective igm transmission factor @xmath71 . assuming the stellar population , ism , and dust are similar at @xmath20 = 6.9 and @xmath20 = 5.7",
    ", we obtain @xmath72 here @xmath73 and @xmath74 are uv and ly@xmath8  luminosity densities , respectively .",
    "the ratio of uv luminosity densities @xmath75/@xmath76 = 0.63 is obtained from @xcite . from table [ lyalfs ] , we obtain the ratio of total ly@xmath8  luminosity densities @xmath77/@xmath78 = 0.22 .",

    "@xmath80 = 0.29 from @xcite ) .    converting the ly@xmath8  emission line transmission factor to neutral igm fraction @xmath13 is model dependent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an important factor is the shift of the ly@xmath8  line with respect to the systemic velocity , which is widely observed and may be explained by ly@xmath8  radiative transfer in a galactic wind or outflow .",
    "the ly@xmath8  velocity shift measurements of @xmath0 67 galaxies are very limited and are mostly around 100200 kms@xmath5 ( @xcite , but see two uv luminous galaxies with 400 - 500 kms@xmath5 reported by @xcite ) . with the analytic model of @xcite , assuming a ly@xmath8  velocity shift of 0 and 360 kms@xmath5 , the value of @xmath79 = 0.30 corresponds to @xmath13 @xmath14 0.0 and 0.7 respectively .    by comparing our observed ly@xmath8  lf at @xmath16 to that predicted with the radiative transfer simulations by (",

    "this suggests that the true distribution of ionized region sizes may differ appreciably from those used in literature @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the neutral hydrogen fraction is @xmath81 @xmath14 0.40.6 at @xmath16 .",
    "the range of @xmath81 value is caused by the uncertainties in the models .",
    "the bump at the bright end of the ly@xmath8  lf is an indicator of large enough ionized bubbles , where the hubble flow and galactic inflow / outflow can bring ly@xmath8  photons out of resonance , thus leading to different evolution of ly@xmath8  lf at the bright end and the faint end .",
    "the uneven distribution of these laes ( figure [ fig : f-1 ] ) may indicate a patchy reionization at @xmath0 7 .",
    "larger lager samples in future will more definitely establish whether the degree of clustering in figure  [ fig : f-1 ] requires patchy reionization .    from the introduction section of @xcite , which gave the proper radius of a strmgren sphere and the gunn - peterson effect optical depth of a lae with outflow velocity @xmath82 in _ eor",
    "_ , we know that even the brightest lae can not produce a large enough ionized bubble to effectively reduce the optical depth to @xmath83 1 .",
    "we would expect that some additional sources of photons must be associated with the bright laes , or these bright laes have very large ly@xmath8  offset velocities .",
    "it is possible that these bright laes are candidates of faint active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or direct collapse black holes .    from figure",
    "[ fig : f-1 ] , we do see some additional galaxies associated with the bright laes .",
    "however , we can not go deeper to find fainter laes with lager , and the clustering of laes at @xmath0 7 is beyond the topic of this letter .",
    "future deep narrowband imaging with subaru would resolve more additional faint galaxies associated with the bright laes .",
    "till now , only eight ly@xmath8  velocity offsets at @xmath19 6 were reported by comparing ly@xmath8  line with uv line ciii]1909 @xcite or fir line [ cii ] @xcite . among these , only two lbgs , which are among the brightest rest - frame uv luminous lbgs at @xmath19 6 , have large ly@xmath8  offsets of 430@xmath8469 kms@xmath5 and 504@xmath8452 kms@xmath5 @xcite .",
