    ", the model writes : @xmath11 with @xmath12 the neumann boundary conditions ensure the conservation of individuals through the mutation process .",
    "the invasion of cane toads has interested several field biologists .",
    "the data collected @xcite show that the speed of invasion has always been increasing during the eighty first years of propagation and that younger individuals at the edge of the invasion front have shown significant changes in their morphology compared to older populations .",
    "this example of ecological problem among others ( see the expansion of bush crickets in britain @xcite ) illustrates the necessity of having models able to describe space - trait interactions .",
    "several works have addressed the issue of front invasion in ecology , where the trait is related to dispersal ability @xcite .",
    "it has been postulated that selection of more motile individuals can occur , even if they have no advantage regarding their reproductive rate , due to spatial sorting @xcite .",
    "recently , some models for populations structured simultaneously by phenotypical traits and a space variable have emerged . a similar model to in a discrete trait setting has been studied by dockery _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , they prove that in a bounded space domain and with a rate of growth @xmath13 heterogeneous in space , the only nontrivial evolutionarily stable state ( ess ) is a population dominated by the slowest diffusing phenotype .",
    "this conclusion is precisely the opposite of what is expected at the edge of an invading front . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study propagation in a model close to , where the trait affects the growth rate @xmath14 but not the dispersal ability .",
    "this latter assumption is made to take into account that the most favorable phenotypical trait may depend on space .",

    "studying propagation phenomena in nonlocal equations can be pretty involved since some qualitative features like turing instability may occur at the back of the front , see @xcite , due to lack of comparison principles . nevertheless , it is sometimes still possible to construct travelling fronts with rather abstract arguments . in this article , we aim to give a complete proof of some formal results that were previously announced in @xcite . namely construct some travelling waves solutions of with the expected qualitative features at the edge of the front .",
