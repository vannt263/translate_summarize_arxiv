    "the question of whether there are young galaxies in the local universe forming stars for the first time is of considerable interest for galaxy formation and cosmological studies .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , cold dark matter models predict that low - mass dwarf galaxies could still be forming at the present epoch because they originate from density fluctuations considerably smaller than those giving rise to the giant ones .",
    "thus the existence of young dwarf galaxies in the local universe would put strong constraints on the primordial density fluctuation spectrum .",
    "second , while much progress has been made in finding large populations of galaxies at high ( @xmath9 @xmath7 3 ) redshifts @xcite , truly young galaxies in the process of forming remain elusive in the distant universe .",
    "the spectra of those far - away galaxies generally indicate the presence of a substantial amount of heavy elements , implying previous star formation and metal enrichment . thus it is important to have examples of truly young galaxies in the local universe because they can be used as laboratories to study star formation and chemical enrichment processes in environments that are sometimes much more pristine than those in known high - redshift galaxies .",
    "moreover , their proximity allows studies of their structure , metal content , and stellar populations with a sensitivity , precision , and spatial resolution that faint distant high - redshift galaxies do not allow . finally , in the hierarchical model of galaxy formation",
    ", large galaxies result from the merging of smaller structures .",
    "these building - block galaxies are too faint and small to be studied at high redshifts , while we stand a much better chance of understanding them if we can find some local examples .",
    "the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy izw18   is one of the best candidates for being a truly young galaxy .",
    "it is described by @xcite as a double system of compact galaxies , which are in fact two bright knots of star formation separated by 5  and referred to as the brighter northwest ( nw ) and fainter southeast ( se ) components ; these two components comprise the main body .",
    "later studies revealed a blue irregular star - forming region @xmath8 22  northwest of the nw component , referred to as component c. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have shown the c component to have a systemic radial velocity equal to that of the ionized gas in the nw and se components , thus establishing its physical association with izw18 .",
    "furthermore , 21 cm vla mapping by @xcite has shown that this component is embedded within a common h i envelope with the main body .",
    "as the lowest - metallicity galaxy known , izw18   has been studied intensively over the thirty years since the first determination of its heavy element abundance @xcite .",
    "the low oxygen abundance of 1/50 the solar value of izw18   has been confirmed by many groups ( * ? ? ? *  and references therein ) .",
    "this lack of chemical enrichment has led to the idea that izw18may be a young galaxy , only now forming stars for the first time @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that the heavy element abundance of a bcd is a good age indicator .",
    "they found that all bcds with heavy element mass fraction @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12/20 show constant c / o and n / o abundance ratios , and interpret this constancy as meaning that c and n in these most metal - deficient galaxies are made in the same massive stars that produce o , and that intermediate - mass stars ( 3 @xmath13 @xmath11 @xmath14 @xmath15 9 @xmath13 ) have not had time to die and release their c and n production .",
    "this puts an age upper limit of the order of 400 myr for these extremely metal - deficient bcds @xcite .",
    "it was first thought that izw18   did not follow that trend as @xcite have derived a c / o ratio for izw18   that is considerably higher than in other metal - poor bcds , and concluded that carbon in izw18  has been enriched by an older generation of stars .",
    "however , @xcite have rederived the c / o abundance ratio in izw18   and found a value in agreement with that of other bcds with @xmath10 @xmath16 @xmath12/20 . therefore",
    ", no preceding low - mass carbon - producing stellar population needs to be invoked .",
    "young dynamical ages have been inferred for izw18  from the structure of expanding superbubbles of ionized gas driven by supernova explosions ( 15    27myr : @xcite ; 13    15myr : @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusion that izw18   might be a young primeval galaxy in the local universe , with age @xmath11 400 myr , has been challenged , however , by the authors of several recent color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies of stars resolved in _ hst _  images of izw18 . in the first cmd study based on @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 images , @xcite concluded that the optical colors of the stars in izw18   were consistent with those of young massive main sequence stars , and the colors of the unresolved emission with an intermediate - age stellar population of b and early a stars .",
    "but the data did not go deep enough to detect individual evolved stars .    from an independent set of @xmath20 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 images , @xcite concluded that the current star formation in the main body began at least 30  50 myr ago , continuing to the present , consistent with the dynamical ages derived from expanding superbubbles of ionized gas .",
    "as for the c component , @xcite found that it consists of an older stellar population composed of faint red stars with ages 100  300 myr on which the current modest starburst ( blue stars with age @xmath8 40 myr ) is superimposed in its southeastern half .",
    "those ages are consistent with those derived from heavy element abundance ratios @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have reanalyzed the two _ hst_/wfpc2 data sets above and , going deeper thanks to improved reduction techniques , concluded that there were two episodes of star formation in the main body : a first episode occurring over the last 0.5  1 gyr , an age more than 10 times larger than that derived by @xcite , and a second episode with more intense activity taking place between 15 and 20 myr ago , with no star formation occurring within the last 15 myr . for the c component",
    ", @xcite estimated an age not exceeding 200  myr .",
    "subsequently , @xcite has carried out a near - infrared ( nir ) cmd study based on _",
    "@xmath2 ( _ f110w _ ) and @xmath22 ( _ f160w _ ) images .",
    "he concluded that the main body of izw18  is dominated by two populations , one 1020myr population of red supergiants and another considerably older 0.15gyr population of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and red - giant stars .",
    "thus , it appears that cmds require two episodes of star formation in izw18 : an old burst , responsible for the red faint stars , and a more recent one which produces the red supergiant and blue massive stars seen to dominate the cmds .",
    "more recently , @xcite also found that two bursts were necessary to explain the dynamical and chemical evolution in izw18 : an older burst which occurred @xmath23300myr ago , and a more recent one with age between 47myr .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have pointed out that comparison of observed colors with those predicted by burst models of star formation inevitably leads to an underestimate of the age , and an overestimate of the star - formation rate .",
    "it is therefore important to consider various star formation scenarios ( such as continuous star formation ) in any comparison between models and observations . @xcite and @xcite have gone to the other extreme by arguing that star formation in izw18  may proceed , not in episodic bursts , but in a continuous fashion over a long period of many gyr , at the low rate of about @xmath24yr@xmath25 , more than a 1000 times lower than that inferred by @xcite .",
    "this continuous low star formation would result in an extended underlying low surface brightness stellar component in izw18 .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the existence of such a component is supported neither by spectroscopic nor photometric measurements of the extended emission around the star forming regions in izw18 .",
    "it is thus clear that , in spite of numerous studies , there is still no consensus regarding the age of izw18   and its star formation history .",
    "while cmd analysis is the method of choice for the determination of stellar ages , it is also subject to several uncertainties such as distance determination , extinction , and contamination of the stellar colors by gaseous emission .",
    "the nir bands provide a clear advantage over optical bands in this context , because of their enhanced sensitivity to evolved red stars and reduced effects of dust extinction . to revisit the question of the ages of the stellar populations in izw18 , we have acquired deep @xmath0 images with ukirt / ircam3 . using these together with _",
    "wfpc2 and nicmos archival images , we can directly address the above questions of extinction and gas contamination .",
    "moreover , we can derive the color transformations between the _ hst _  and ground - based filters .",
    "this is necessary because the _ hst _  nicmos 1  filter ( _ f110w _ ) is very different from the standard johnson @xmath2 filter . by necessity",
    ", we shall focus here on average stellar surface brightness distributions rather than on luminosities of single stars .",
    "while seemingly a liability , such an approach will allow us a more complete examination of the stellar content of the galaxy and its age .",
    "the observations and analysis techniques are presented in section [ obs ] .",
    "the derived nir and hybrid optical - nir colors are discussed in section [ broadband ] . in section [ age ] , we model the broadband colors with a variety of star - formation histories , and discuss the results in terms of stellar population ages , gaseous emission and dust extinction . we summarize our conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "we acquired @xmath2 ( 1.2 ) , @xmath22 ( 1.6 ) , and @xmath26 ( 2.2 ) images of izw18 , including the c component , with the 3.8-m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) equipped with ircam3 .",
    "the observations were performed in the ukirt service observing program in march , 1999 , as part of our ongoing project of nir imaging and spectroscopy of bcds .",

    "individual frames were dark - subtracted and flat - fielded with the average of adjacent empty sky frames , after editing them for stars ( to avoid `` holes '' in the reduced frames ) and applying an average - sigma clipping algorithm .",
    "the reduced frames were then aligned and averaged .",
    "all data reduction was carried out in the iraf environment .",
    "photometric calibration was performed by observing standard stars from the ukirt faint standard list @xcite before and after the source observations .",
    "each standard star was measured in several different positions on the array , and flat - fielded by dividing the clipped mean of the remaining frames in the sequence . to correct the standard - star photometry for atmospheric extinction",

    "aperture photometry with varying aperture diameters was performed on the nir ukirt and optical wfpc2 images at the locations of the two main star - forming regions in the main body of izw18 , the nw and the se brightness peaks .",
    "to better study color gradients and possible changes in gaseous content and stellar populations over short distances in izw18 , we also performed photometry in circular apertures of radius 1   along a position angle ( pa ) of 149@xmath30 , e from n , aligned with the nw and se brightness peaks .",
    "besides the nw and se peaks , photometry was also obtained for the intermediate region between the nw and se regions ( `` inter '' ) , two extended regions to the nw of the nw peak ( `` nw1 '' and `` nw2 '' ) , and the two extended regions to the se of the se peak ( `` se1 '' and `` se2 '' ) . we used an aperture of radius 15 in the nw2 and se2 regions because of lower signal - to - noise . the different apertures and their designations are shown in fig .",

    "we have also obtained a ukirt nir image of the c component , and performed aperture photometry on two positions : one centered on the main brightness peak denoted by `` c ( central ) '' , and the other on the extended emission toward the nw denoted `` c ( extended ) '' .",

    "the mean optical and hybrid colors were derived in a similar way , with @xmath36mag  arcsec@xmath32  and radius @xmath3555 .",
    "the mean colors of the extended emission turn out to be : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where the quoted uncertainties are the standard deviations of the ensemble , rather than photometric `` errors '' .",

    "the peak at @xmath21@xmath152  corresponds to the approximate superposition of the nw and se peaks in the elliptical average .",
    "although elliptical averaging is important because of the gains that can be achieved in signal - to - noise ratio , the inner structure of izw18  is clearly not symmetric . therefore , to better quantitatively examine color gradients , we have also derived surface - brightness profiles along a `` cut '' , coincident with the orientation of the aperture photometry ( pa=149@xmath30 and aligned with the two main brightness peaks ) .",
    "the width of the cut is 17 in the perpendicular direction ( 6 pixels for the nir images , 38 pixels for wfpc2 ) .",

    "by combining the optical _ hst _  archival images together with our nir data , we have at our disposal six broadband filters , @xmath20 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath2 , @xmath22 and @xmath26 , and thus five independent colors .",
    "we have chosen to analyze @xmath6 , @xmath28 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for the following reasons .",
    "the optical @xmath6 color provides important information about gas contamination , extinction , and young stars .",
    "moreover , it distinguishes very well ionized gas emission from evolved stars .",
    "the nir colors put constraints on the presence of an evolved stellar population , as well as on the presence of hot dust and ionized gas ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "hybrid optical - nir color combinations , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are effective extinction diagnostics : according to the @xcite extinction curve and @xcite , the reddenings for @xmath5 and @xmath4 are respectively @xmath44 and @xmath45 , large enough to allow the separation of the effects of stellar population age gradients from those of dust .",
    "these hybrid colors also provide important diagnostics for the nature of the stellar populations .",
    "in particular , the @xmath5 color is very sensitive to age , as the onset of the agb phase at @xmath8 100  myr causes a sudden intense reddening , making @xmath5 larger than @xmath8 2 @xcite .",
    "hybrid optical - nir colors are ambiguous however for discriminating stellar population effects from ionized gas contamination and extinction effects since they are red in all cases . to distinguish gas from older stars , the color of choice is @xmath6 and , to a lesser extent @xmath28 : while these colors are blue for gas , they are red for older stars . we discuss in turn the optical , nir , and hybrid colors and color gradients in the following subsections .",
    "inspection of the @xmath6 color image ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] ) shows that there is a blue `` crown '' surrounding the nw star cluster , a red border to the e of the se cluster , and numerous very red point sources scattered throughout the nw and se brightness peaks and the region separating them .",
    "there is also a blue region around the se1 star cluster .",
    "the @xmath6 colors in the crown range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , and with redder colors toward the se .",
    "the star clusters themselves appear to be relatively blue ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we ascribe the colors in the crown to ionized gas for the following three reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath6 color of ionized gas is @xmath8 0.4 at the redshift of izw18 , similar to the crown color .",
    "second , in the _ hst _",
    "@xmath19 image ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] ) , filamentary structures can be seen surrounding the nw brightness peak , coincident with the blue crown .",
    "third , examination of the h@xmath49 maps of @xcite and @xcite show very high equivalent widths at the location of the crown .",
    "this interpretation will be further discussed in the context of our color fits in @xmath43[models ] .",
    "the extended emission , at @xmath50  and @xmath51 mag  arcsec@xmath32 , shows also very blue @xmath52 .",
    "such blue @xmath6 colors are highly unusual in bcds .",
    "they are bluer than in any of the h ii galaxies studied by @xcite but are comparable to those in sbs0335052 @xcite , another extremely metal - poor bcd ( 1/40 solar metallicity ) .    a striking feature of the @xmath6 map shown in the right panel of fig . [ fig : opt ] is the patchiness of the color , which can be most probably attributed to spatial variations in the dust and ionized gas emission .",
    "in addition to the patchiness on small scales , there are also large - scale color gradients .",
    "these can be clearly seen in the cuts shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] .",
    "there is a general reddening of @xmath6 going from the nw to the se : @xmath6 is @xmath8 0.6 at the northernmost tip of the extended region to the nw , and gets progressively redder going toward the se where , outside the main brightness peak , @xmath6 is @xmath8 0.2 .",
    "in addition to this general trend , there are local red maxima in @xmath6 near the nw and se clusters , and further to the s ( se2 ) .",
    "the red features evident in the @xmath6 color image ( right panel of figure [ fig : opt ] ) toward the se can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] at a radial distance of roughly @xmath53 , and the blue @xmath6 of the filaments toward the nw at a radial distance of @xmath54 .",
    "the high resolution of the optical color images also reveals numerous very red point sources , particularly in the nw star cluster , where @xmath6 can be as high as 1.5 locally .",
    "even higher @xmath55 is seen in the reddest compact sources between the two brightness peaks .",
    "such red @xmath6 colors are consistent with those of bright extremely late - type stars ( @xmath56k5 ) @xcite , presumably red supergiants , or with those of dusty h ii regions .      the @xmath28 color image shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nir ] also reveals color gradients , although most of the image has @xmath57 ( light grey contours ) , the colors of young or intermediate - age stars , assuming there is no contamination from ionized gas emission .",
    "moderately red @xmath28 ( @xmath8 0.4 , white contours ) is seen towards the n of the nw cluster , and along the n border of the se cluster .",
    "very red @xmath28 structures ( @xmath58 , dark grey contours ) lie toward the e and the se , both outside of the se brightness peak . toward the e , @xmath48 and @xmath59 , colors which are inconsistent with evolved stars . toward the se ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath5 are redder , which , together with @xmath28 , could suggest the presence of an evolved stellar population . however , because the @xmath28 structure of the red regions is compact and different from the diffuse structure seen in other colors , it is likely that dust extinction also contributes to the red colors ( see sect .",
    "[ gas+dust ] ) .",
    "a reddening of the @xmath28 color by 0.1 mag corresponds to an @xmath60 of order unity .    the @xmath3 image ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nir ] ) shows an even more inhomogeneous distribution .",
    "while the region to the e of the nw cluster has a relatively blue @xmath28 , its @xmath3 color is very red ( @xmath8 0.6 , dark grey contours ) .",
    "such a combination of colors can only be attributed to hot dust ( with a temperature @xmath61k ) or ionized gas , since dust extinction or red stars would result in a red @xmath28 as well .",
    "we tend to exclude the hypothesis that the red @xmath3 is due to hot dust since the uv flux reported by @xcite is not sufficient to heat dust to the necessary high temperatures even at 1pc radius . indeed",
    ", the colors of all regions with red @xmath3 are almost certainly due to ionized gas , with the exception of the region to the e of the se cluster .",
    "there , @xmath28 is also red , which could be due to either red stars or dust extinction .",

    "[ fig : cut ] ) also reflect the information in the color images . along the cut",
    ", @xmath28 is relatively constant , while @xmath3 has a local peak ( @xmath62 ) in the `` intermediate '' region between the two main star clusters .      the colors in the optical - nir hybrid @xmath4 and @xmath5 images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hybrid ] ) also show an inhomogeneous spatial distribution , with several compact regions being significantly redder than their surroundings .",
    "in particular , red @xmath4 ( @xmath632.2 ) is confined to six small clumps outside the main nw and se star clusters , and to the se of the se cluster .",

    "fig : pro ] ) also show the effects of small - scale inhomogeneity , as well as large - scale color changes .",
    "the @xmath6 color of the extended emission is bluer than the main body , while @xmath4 and @xmath5 are redder ; such a trend would be expected for ionized gas emission .",
    "the patchy distribution of the hybrid colors can also be seen in the right panels of fig . [",

    "the bluest @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors are observed near the nw and se brightness peaks , with both colors becoming redder farther away .",

    "is composed of stars formed prior to the stars composing the young stellar population .",
    "we derived the colors expected in each observing aperture by `` mixing '' curve calculations , usually used in connection with color - color diagrams .",
    "in such calculations , one starts with a `` main '' color associated with a physical component , in our case young instantaneous- or continuous - burst stellar populations . that color is then `` mixed '' with colors of other physical components , in our case continuous - burst older stars and gas emission ( including both continuum and line emission as discussed above ) .",
    "finally , foreground extinction is taken into account by reddening the `` mixed '' colors .",
    "mathematically , the resulting colors do not depend on which component defines the `` main '' color .    for each region , we derived the model colors ( @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath28 , and @xmath3 ) that best fit the observed ones by minimizing the @xmath76 .",
    "the uncertainties in the @xmath76 are the photometric uncertainties in the colors , obtained by adding in quadrature the photometric uncertainty of each filter .",
    "color errors were constrained to be at least 0.05mag because of possible systematic problems with _ hst_/ground - based transformations .",
    "free parameters in the model fitting include the age of the young stellar population and its burst mode of star formation ( instantaneous or continuous ) , the age of the old stellar population ( constrained to be a continuous burst ) , the @xmath2 luminosity fraction of old stars @xmath77 , the @xmath2 luminosity fraction of ionized gas @xmath78 , and the foreground visual extinction @xmath60 . rather than fixing @xmath60 to the values derived from the balmer decrement , we let @xmath60 vary in the fits , since ionized gas may be subject to a different extinction than the stellar emission @xcite .",
    "however , fits performed in this way are unconstrained since we have five colors and five free parameters ( six if the young - population burst scenario is included ) .",
    "thus , to limit the parameter space to be explored , we had to impose additional observational constraints .",
    "one such constraint is the _",
    "ew_s of the h@xmath49 line at different locations in izw18   @xcite which limits the range of ages the young stars can have .",
    "furthermore , photometric studies of bcds [ e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ] , have shown that the same component of evolved stars is present in all regions within a galaxy .",
    "therefore , we constrain the evolved stellar population to be the same everywhere in izw18 . to determine which ages are possible , we need to examine the colors of a region relatively free of the ionized gas emission known to be widespread in some parts of izw18   @xcite and which contaminates the observed broadband colors .",
    "the c component is such a region ; it has the lowest _",
    "ew_(h@xmath72 ) of the izw18  complex .",
    "therefore , in principle , we can first fit the c component colors , without having to worry about gas contamination ; then , the old stars in the izw18  main body can be represented by the best - fit older stellar population in the c component .",
    "such a procedure is supported by optical spectroscopy and imaging which suggest that star formation is oldest in the c component ( age @xmath23100  ",
    "200myr ) and has propagated into the main body @xcite .",
    "we therefore fit the c component by setting the gas fraction @xmath78 and extinction @xmath60 to zero , and letting the age of the young and old populations vary , together with the young - star burst scenario and the old - star fraction @xmath77 . by constraining the model prediction of the h@xmath49_ew _  in the burst scenario of the young population to be consistent with its observed value ( 20",
    "  60  @xcite ) , we find the colors of the c component to be best fit by a young instantaneous - burst ( ib ) stellar population 15myr of age , with a dominant @xmath79 older stellar population of age 100200myr .",
    "the second - best fit was obtained with a young continuous - burst ( cb ) 1020myr of age , combined with @xmath79 of 100200myr older stars .",
    "the third - best fit was similar to the best one , but with @xmath80 of a 20myr young population .",
    "these results are reported in table [ table : fitc ] .    the minimum @xmath76 value @xmath81=16.7 is obtained in the ib scenario , and gives a best fit with root - mean - square ( rms ) residuals ( over the five colors ) of 0.21 mag , while the cb @xmath81=17.0 corresponds to an rms of 0.23 mag .",
    "if we consider all the old stellar populations found in solutions with a @xmath76 value between @xmath81  and @xmath81@xmath751 , we find that , in addition to the best - fit range of 100200myr age , plausible other age ranges for the old stellar populations for izw18include 100500myr , 10200myr , 10500myr , and 3500myr .",
    "although stars older than this gave substantially worse fits , to be conservative , and because the age of izw18  is so controversial , we have included in the subsequent analysis the following additional older stellar populations : 3myr1gyr , 100myr1gyr , 01gyr , 100myr2gyr . as a result , for the remaining main - body regions , we have considered a total of nine possible old stellar populations .",
    "populations older than 2gyr are ruled out , since the @xmath81  values associated with them ( together with the _ ew _  constraint on the young stars ) were ranked at @xmath8 600@xmath82 in the best ( ib ) case .",
    "the worst of the older populations retained for further consideration ( e.g. , 2gyr ) ranked 263@xmath83 .",
    "we then fit the colors of each region in the main body of izw18by letting the age of the young stellar component vary , subject to _ ew _  constraints , as well as the parameters @xmath77 , @xmath84 , and @xmath60 .",

    "the best - fit colors are shown in both panels , and connected to the observed ones in the right panel with a dotted line .",

    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : chisum ] shows the clear minimum for an older age of 200myr .",
    "although the difference in @xmath76 between an oldest age of 200myr and 500myr is not significant enough for us to definitely exclude 500myr as the oldest age , we can definitely exclude an upper limit of 1gyr .",
    "in fact , the best fit with an oldest age of 1gyr is ranked 8@xmath82 , and has @xmath87 with respect to @xmath86 . as for the burst scenario ,",

    "hence , our requirement that the same evolved stellar population be present in all regions is not unduly constraining our results , since the condition is met naturally by our fits .",
    "one exception , nw2 , is insignificant , since according to our fits it contains no evolved stars ; consequently the resultant @xmath81  is insensitive to older age .",

    "in all cases , the rms residuals of the fits ( col . 6 , 1st line ) are smaller than or comparable to the rms photometric uncertainties ( col .",

    "[ fig : m2 ] and [ fig : m4 ] ) .",
    "inspection of table [ table : par ] shows that the c component and the main se cluster apparently host the highest fraction of evolved stars with @xmath77=0.6 .",
    "the other regions have lower @xmath77 , with zero old stars in the farthest region to the nw ( nw2 ) ; indeed 80% of the emission in nw2 is ionized gas . in the main body , the old - star fractions suggest that star formation has been proceeding the longest in the main clusters , se and nw , since half or more of the light there can be attributed to a 100 - 200myr continuous burst .    the ages of the younger burst range from 3myr in the nw part of the main body to 10myr in most of the se ( with the exception of se1 which has an age of 3myr ) . in the c component ,",
    "the younger burst is older , with an age of 15myr or more ( see also table [ table : fit ] ) .",
    "because of the gas emission , in most of the regions in the main body ( with the exception of the nw cluster ) , young stars comprise less than half of the observed flux .",
    "the highest fraction of young stars is present in the nw star cluster ( 50% ) , while toward the se , the fractions range from 10% to 30% . these results will be compared with previous work in @xmath43[comparison ] .",
    "we discuss here the evidence that the emission in many regions in izw18  is dominated by gas and dust , rather than by old stars , and how neglecting this can affect the derived age .",
    "table [ table : par ] shows that in the main body only the bright nw cluster is free of ionized gas . with the exception of the main nw cluster , _ all _ of the remaining regions",
    "contain a significant amount of ionized gas .",
    "as mentioned above , the gas fraction @xmath78 is highest to the nw ( nw2 ) , where 80% of its light is due to gas emission .",
    "this gas contribution is lowest in the se , consistent with the relatively high fraction of evolved stars derived .",
    "these results are compatible with the qualitative analysis in @xmath43[optcolors ] and with other data .",
    "deep keck spectra of izw18   obtained by @xcite reveal extended gas emission around the nw component , with h@xmath49 emission detected as far as 30  from it .",
    "the situation in the nw star cluster is contrary to this , since that region is only well fit by pure stellar emission , without any gas contribution .",
    "our finding is also consistent with the h@xmath49 map of izw18   which shows an apparent `` hole '' in the gas distribution at the location of the nw component @xcite .",
    "extinction is also measurable in the main nw and se clusters ( @xmath88mag ) , and in the extended region . according to our fits , the light in the extended region surrounding the main body of izw18  contains 40% evolved stars of age 100 - 200myr , and 60% gas , together with an extinction @xmath89 mag .",
    "the high @xmath76 and the large uncertainties[cuts ] , these are the standard deviation over the ellipse . ] here reflect the difficulty of using an elliptical average , especially because in the nw2 region , the emission is 80% gas without a measurable contribution from an evolved stellar population , while in the se , there appear to more old stars ( 40% of the light ) and less gas .    in the se region , @xmath6 is redder ( @xmath560 ) , as are the other colors , and , from table [ table : fit ] , it appears that the color gradient evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] is due to a population gradient , coupled with some extinction and a spatially - varying contribution from ionized gas .",
    "a greater extinction in the se cluster is supported also by other data @xcite : small - scale @xmath60 from the balmer decrement in the se region is 0.24 mag as compared to @xmath60 = 0.04 mag for the nw region .",
    "the slight difference between these and the results of our fits is almost certainly due to different aperture sizes and the spatially - varying interstellar medium ( ism ) .    indeed , using the _ hst_/wfpc2 extinction maps , @xcite show that the h@xmath49/h@xmath72 ratio varies considerably spatially , and",
    "show that such extinction can be produced by @xmath90@xmath13 of dust .",
    "the structure in the extinction inferred from the recombination line ratios is very similar to the one seen in our optical / hybrid color images : the se and the e side of the intermediate zone which are the most affected by extinction ( see figs.[fig : opt ] , [ fig : hybrid ] ) are also the sites of the reddest colors .",
    "cannon et al .",
    "speculate that there is a band of extinction between the nw and se components , but are unable to measure it because of the absence of optical line emission .",
    "our color images , in particular @xmath4 , reveal such a band , suggesting that much , if not all , of the structure seen in the colors is due to variations in the ism , rather than to gradients in the stellar populations .",
    "the _ structure _ of the extended emission and the color gradients can also help understand its nature . as discussed in @xmath43[broadband ] , the colors in izw18  vary on small spatial scales . such variations are not the smooth ones that would be expected for stellar population age gradients , but rather are patchy and inhomogeneous , common signatures of variations in dust extinction and gas emission .",
    "indeed , the reddest structures in the colors are associated with compact sources rather than with smooth sheets of underlying red stars , which are conspicuously absent in our images .",
    "another signature of the ism in izw18  can be found from the comparison of the ground - based @xmath2 image with the _ hst_/nicmos _ f110w _  image .",

    "the opposing effects of gas ( which makes @xmath28 bluer ) and dust extinction ( which reddens the colors ) make it difficult to quantify their combined effects .",
    "we can only emphasize that if these effects are not taken into account in the interpretation of the observed colors , the inferred age for the stellar populations may be incorrect .      to better assess gas contamination and its effect on the fit results , we have estimated the gas fractions colors in the nw and se clusters using two different techniques : 1 )  from the optical recombination line ratios [ e.g. , @xcite ] and assuming zero extinction , infer the nir line fluxes and gas continuum ; 2 )  from our new nir spectra",
    "obtained at the keck and ukirt telescopes ( hunt et al .",

    "the extrapolation from the optical gives slightly lower gas fractions ( 15% in the se and 5% in the nw ) than our nir spectra ( se : 32% , nw : 22% ) , however the former do not take line emission into account .",
    "both strategies give results which are roughly consistent with each other , and broadly consistent with the results from the color fits , especially considering the different aperture sizes and orientations .",
    "the spectroscopic apertures are larger than the photometric ones and unequal ( nw is larger than se ) , and the spectroscopic slit was oriented at a slightly different angle ( pa=139@xmath30 ) than our photometric cut ( pa=149@xmath30 ) .",
    "the larger gas fractions measured by our new nir spectra relative to the optical extrapolations may also suggest a larger extinction . in spite of these caveats ,",
    "the important result is that both techniques confirm spectroscopically that the se cluster is more contaminated by gas than the nw , corroborating the results of our fits .    to determine if the age of the evolved stars inferred from our fits depends sensitively on our treatment of gas emission , we also ran a series of stars - only fits , that is to say _ without including the contribution of gas emission to the model colors_. although the resulting region @xmath81  values were much larger ( @xmath81  @xmath94 ) , the maximum ages for the older stellar population remain 200 - 500myr",
    "moreover , these stars - only fits give the same ranking for the older stellar populations : namely the @xmath86  was found for an ib of age 100 - 200myr , with the next smallest value given by one of age 100 - 500myr .    to ascertain if the age of the evolved stars inferred from our fits depends on _ which _ colors are fit",
    ", we repeated the stars - only fits on different subsets of colors .",
    "we first eliminated one or both of the hybrid colors @xmath5 and @xmath4 from the fits , since these colors are presumably the most sensitive to red old populations .",
    "however , the results do not change : we obtain the same upper limit to the older age of 200 - 500myr , and the ranking of the fits is the same as with all five colors    we then eliminated @xmath6 from the fits , and again modelled the four remaining colors ( now two hybrid ones and two nir ) without including gas emission .",
    "this was done for two external regions ( exten .",

    "it turns out that _ eliminating this purely optical color from the fits significantly changes the estimate for the old age in these two regions_. without @xmath6 , the age of the evolved stars becomes 100myr-2gyr ; @xmath77 becomes unity for the extended region and 0.7 for se2 ( instead of 0.4 ) .",

    "( @xmath97 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath98 ) of the gas are similar to those of evolved stars ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) .",
    "therefore , hybrid colors can be equally well fit by gas and evolved stars ; red @xmath4 and @xmath5 are _ ambiguous _ since ionized gas and old stars are similarly red .",
    "thus they can not be used to discriminate gas from evolved stars in galaxies such as izw18 .",
    "@xmath6 on the other hand is a good discriminator since gas and evolved stellar colors differ by @xmath101mag .",

    "such a small fraction is below the detectability limits of our observations , because of the worse ground - based resolution as compared to that of hst , and because of the low impact on the colors over scales of @xmath1105 .",
    "the mass contribution from such stars is small . assuming the @xmath105 ratio of an evolved population ( @xmath1061gyr ) to be 1.1 in solar units ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and that of intermediate - age ( 100500myr ) and young stars ( @xmath10750myr ) to be respectively 0.5 and 0.1",
    ", we calculate the fraction of the total stellar mass that can be in the form of old stars in the nicmos cmd . to conservatively account for incompleteness",
    ", we assign 4% of the total stellar light to an old stellar population of age @xmath1061gyr , twice as large as the 2% fraction observed in the cmd . using the fractions in table [ table : par ]",
    ", we then adjust the light of the intermediate - age population ( by subtracting 0.04 from @xmath77 ) , and calculate for each region the fraction of the stellar mass that could reside in old stars .",
    "we do not consider those regions where gas contributes more than 70% to the @xmath2 light .",
    "we find that the total stellar mass in izw18  in old stars could be at most 22% ; this high fraction is found in the se1 and inter .",
    "regions where half or more of the light comes from young stars .",
    "if we consider an extreme case ( not supported by our data ) , with no gas and 70% of the light in young stars , the 4% @xmath2 light fraction in old stars would correspond to 18% of the stellar mass .",
    "thus , even in the least favorable scenario , the stellar mass fraction in old stars does not exceed 20% .    with deep ground - based ccd and nir images of izw18",
    ", @xcite find evidence for a @xmath108 color that increases with radius , reaching @xmath109 at @xmath21=10 .",
    "they attribute the red @xmath108 color to a stellar population with an age of more than 1gyr . while we confirm the color trend ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : pro ] and [ fig : cut ] ) , we disagree with the interpretation .",
    "our five - color fits are more consistent with a substantial ( 60 - 80% ) contribution from ionized gas in the extended regions . as mentioned above , this is because we have included the @xmath6 color in our fits ; without the @xmath6 color , the red @xmath108 color mimics stars of age @xmath1061gyr .",
    "a recent photometric analysis including optical colors by @xcite also finds the extended regions surrounding izw18  to be highly contaminated by gas . taking the gas emission into account , and with an independent analysis",
    ", they also derive an upper limit of @xmath8500myr for the age of izw18 .",
    "we next compare our findings to those of @xcite who found , from their cmd study of _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 images , evidence for two bursts .",
    "the first , older episode , `` started any time between 1 and 0.2gyr ago '' , while the second , more recent , one has an age between 15 and 20myr .",
    "given that they deliberately excluded the brightest hii regions and unresolved star clusters from their analysis , their age estimate of the of the young burst and ours agree rather well .",
    "however , the older age estimate depends on the distance adopted for izw18 . the difference between our older age estimate of @xmath8500myr and their upper limit of 1gyr",
    "could be reduced if the distance to izw18  were 12.6mpc @xcite instead of 10mpc as they assumed .",
    "@xcite s derived age of 200myr for the c component ( with large error bars as the data are of limited sensitivity ) is in good agreement with our result .",
    "recent work on the chemical abundances and the star - formation history in izw18has also suggested that there were two bursts of star formation , one which occurred 300myr ago , and a young one with age of 4 - 7myr @xcite .",
    "our age estimates of the two stellar populations in izw18  are in very good agreement with these ages . considering the two radically different approaches ,",
    "this is a strong confirmation of the young age ( @xmath107500myr ) of the oldest major stellar population in izw18 .",
    "we have presented deep ukirt @xmath0 images of the blue compact dwarf izw18  and analyzed these images in conjunction with archival _ hst_/wfpc2 optical images . by dividing the main body into eight different regions , and fitting five broadband colors with evolutionary synthesis models to these and the c component , we are able to set an upper limit to the age of the major component of the old stellar population in izw18 .",
    "we find the following :    1 .",
    "the oldest major stellar population in izw18 , contributing @xmath7 78% of its mass , is at most 500myr old . within the uncertainties of our data , by fitting the optical , nir , and optical - nir colors with evolutionary synthesis models of various star formation histories we are able to set an upper limit of @xmath8 500 myr for the age of the oldest stars in this major component .",
    "however , our data are insensitive to as much as a 22% contribution in mass ( 4% in @xmath2 light ) from stars older than 500myr in izw18 .",
    "2 .   the young stellar populations in the main body of izw18  and the c component range from 3 to 15myr in age .",
    "the largest fractions of older stars appear to be found in the c component and in the se star cluster ; in the remaining regions , young stars and gas contribute half or more of the observed light .",
    "the observed broadband colors in most regions of izw18   are significantly affected by ionized gas emission and dust extinction .",
    "red @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are not reliable indicators of old stellar populations with red colors because ionized gas emission is also red .",
    "@xmath6 , on the other hand , reliably separates stars from gas because the @xmath6 color of stars is red ( @xmath7 0.4 ) while that of gas is blue ( @xmath8 0.4 ) .",
    "thus the question of the age of izw18  is not settled by our deep nir observations .",
    "while we have shown that the oldest major stellar population in izw18  is at most 500myr old , we can not exclude the possibility that as much as 22% of the mass of izw18  is contributed by stars older than 500myr .",
    "the advent of the advanced survey camera ( acs ) on _ hst _  will allow to settle definitively the debate .",
    "deep acs images with higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than wfpc2 will enable detection of or at least constrain the red giant branch ( rgb ) stellar population in izw18 .",
    "if rgb stars are not detected , then we can set an upper limit for the age of izw18  to be less than @xmath8 1 gyr . if they are detected , izw18  is not young , and the rgb tip can be used to derive its distance .",
