    "globular cluster ( gc ) systems in galaxies have become a useful tool to study the mechanisms of galaxy formation .",
    "thanks to a rise in the level of details in observations , now we can gain insight into the colour , metallicity and abundance gradients of such systems for a large number of galaxies , and build statistically solid scaling relations between gc and galaxy properties .",
    "gcs are for the most part old objects , with ages estimated to be @xmath11 gyr ( brodie et al . 2005 , strader et al . 2005 , peng et al . 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , not only they have survived any violent event in the assembly of their host galaxy , but they also provide a chemical record of the galaxies where they were formed ( pota et al .",
    "coupled with the fact that they are very luminous , they make for excellent probes of the fossil records of galaxies and shed light on the mechanisms of galaxy assembly and star formation history .    of particular interest",
    "is the metallicity distribution of gcs in galaxies .",
    "galaxies of all morphologies have a gc population with an average metallicity that correlates with the galaxy stellar mass or luminosity ( as first shown by brodie @xmath12 huchra 1991 ; lotz et al .",
    "2004 , peng et al .",
    "in addition , most galaxy gc systems exhibit a colour bimodality ( zepf @xmath12 ashman 1993 , ostrov et al .",

    "2006 , larsen et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this is driven by a metallicity bimodality , with bluer gcs being more metal - poor and redder gcs being more metal - rich , while both populations are old ( @xmath11 gyr ) ( forbes et al .",

    "the well - defined metal - rich and metal - poor gc sequences separately follow two _ galaxy stellar mass - gc metallicity _",
    "relations @xmath2_{gc } - \\rm m_{star}$ ] , of which the metal - rich one is stronger and tighter , while the metal - poor one is weaker and exhibits a larger scatter ( larsen et al .",
    "2001 , strader et al .",
    "2006 , peng et al .",
    "2006 , ct et al .",
    "there is increasing evidence that these features of gc systems are universal , from giant ellipticals to dwarfs ( strader et al .",
    "2006 ) , although some galaxies show an even more complex situation , with multiple metallicity peaks ( see for instance peng et al . 2006 , blom et al . 2012 ) .",
    "intriguingly , the differences between blue / metal - poor and red / metal - rich gcs also extend to their dynamical properties , as shown in recent observations ( pota et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the two subpopulations have different spatial distributions inside the host galaxies : the metal - rich gcs are more centrally concentrared , with a radial distribution profile that follows closely the spheroidal stellar component of the galaxy , while the metal - poor gcs show a more extended distribution , and is likely physically associated with the stellar halo ( bassino et al .",

    "2007 , peng et al .",
    "2008 , forbes et al .",

    "2011 represent the best example of the close spatial coupling of metal - rich gcs with galaxy starlight and the more extended distribution of metal - poor gcs ) .",
    "correspondingly , the kinematics of the metal - rich subpopulation follows that of the main stellar component , including rotation ( strader et al .",
    "2011 ) , while the metal - poor subpopulation shows larger velocity dispersion and small or null net rotation .",
    "a scenario has been proposed where gcs are formed in gas - rich ( major ) merger events ; at high redshift ( @xmath13 ) , early mergers of smaller hosts produce metal - poor gcs , while later mergers of more evolved galaxies in high density environments produce metal - rich gcs ( muratov @xmath12 gnedin 2010 , kravtsov @xmath12 gnedin 2005 , bekki et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "these models however encounter a number of problems ; there is no clear prediction about any metallicity bimodality or galaxy mass - gc metallicity relations , and the resulting ages of the metal - rich gcs are too young ( muratov @xmath12 gnedin 2010 ) , an _ ad hoc _ mechanism is needed to shut off blue / metal - poor gc formation ( bekki et al .",
    "2008 , beasley et al .",
    "2002 ) , and an analysis of the observed gc abundance and metallicity gradients is not compatible this kind of formation mechanism ( arnold et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "alternatively it has been proposed that , rather than originating from two main epochs or modes of gc formation , the gc chemo - dynamical bimodality can stem from the galaxy assembly history , without invoking mergers as the gc formation mechanism . in this scenario",
    "the metal - rich gc subpopulation is formed together with the bulk of the galaxy stellar component in an early violent dissipative phase , and during a later slower phase the metal - poor gc subpopulation is accreted , via minor mergers ( forbes et al .",
    "2011 , 1997a , b , arnold et al .",
    "2011 , masters @xmath12 ashman 2010 ) , or via stripping of gcs from satellites ( ct et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "the main difference with the merger scenario is that gcs of different metallicities are formed in different galaxies , and then brought together by galaxy assembly , rather than being formed in the same galaxy at different stages of the galaxy evolution . in this work",
    "we call this the \" assembly scenario  .      in this work",
    "we want to put the \" assemby scenario  in the context of the hierarchical structure formation theory , and investigate whether the gc metallicity bimodality indeed originates from the hierarchical nature of galaxy assembly . in other words , is the gc metallicity bimodality a natural _ prediction _ of hierarchical clustering ?    to answer this question , we build a model to produce the assembly history of galaxies and their gc population , in a series of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we base our model galaxy properties on observed scaling relations as a function of redshift , such as the galaxy mass - metallicity relation @xmath0-\\rm m_{star}$ ] relation , and the galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "we assume that galaxies at @xmath8 were formed through a combination of local ( in - situ ) star formation and accretion of satellite galaxies in a series of merger episodes spanning the lifetime of the galaxy ; the merger rates are obtained from the millennium simulation .",
    "we populate each galaxy in the merger tree with gcs , assuming that they share the metallicity of the main stellar component of their parent galaxy at the epoch of their formation .",
    "when a satellite is accreted , so is its gc population .",
    "we investigate under what conditions the final gc population shows the metallicity bimodality , and follows the observed metal - rich and metal - poor _ galaxy stellar mass - gc metallicity _ relations , as well as the observed galaxy mass - gc number abundance relation ( peng et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 , strader et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the novelty of this analysis is that it provides constraints and predictions 1 ) on the galaxy @xmath2 - \\rm m_{star}$ ] relation as a function of redshift , 2 ) on the galaxy assembly and star formation history , and 3 ) on the evolution of the gc bimodality , and ultimately it presents a method to test the hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we present the model : in section 2 we describe the galaxy assembly and the globular cluster formation , and the monte carlo simulation ; in section 3 we present the derivation of the fiducial galaxy mass - metallicity relation . in section 4",
    "we present our results for the globular cluster metallicity distribution and its implications to constrain galaxy formation , and in section 5 we discuss our findings .",
    "section 6 is a summary of our conclusions .",
    "consider a galaxy of stellar mass @xmath14 at redshift @xmath8 .",
    "this object represents the final stage of a _ merger tree _ , i.e. a system of independent progenitor galaxies which were accreted and contributed to all the mass components ( dark matter , gas , stars , gcs ) that now characterise the galaxy .",
    "at any given time , we identify the _ main progenitor _ in the merger tree as the most massive galaxy that is present in the tree , while we ( improperly ) call _ satellites _ the rest of the objects . for",
    "any given galaxy at @xmath8 , we build a monte carlo simulation with @xmath15 realisations of the merger tree , i.e. @xmath16 different assembly histories .",

    "the plots in this work are made with @xmath19 .",
    "galaxies evolve depending on the mass of the host dark matter halo and on the density of the surrounding environment . in the hierarchical clustering framework smaller objects virialise earlier",
    "( see for instance frenk @xmath12 white 2012 ) , so they contain older , metal - poor stars .",
    "their cycle of star formation and feedback is less efficient , and supernovae winds are more effective in expelling metals from the galaxy , factors that contribute to slow down the rise of metallicity in their stellar populations . at the same time , in more massive galaxies the deeper potential wells render supernovae winds less effective in expelling metals , and the enhanced ability to retain gas allows for sustained star formation and more stellar generations . as a consequence , at all redshifts",
    "a monothonic positive mass - metallicity correlation @xmath20 $ ] is in place for all galaxies in the merger tree .",
    "the derivation of this relation from the observed @xmath0 - \\rm m_{star}$ ] relation will be described in detail in the next section .",
    "we assume the appearance of a globular cluster population in a galaxy is an event of a relatively short duration , and in general not associated with the quiescent star formation phase , but indicative of a particularly intense evolutionary phase .",
    "this assumption is sustained by a number of observations .",
    "first , the observed masses of gcs can reach up to @xmath21 , requiring very intense bursts of star formation .",
    "secondly gcs , which in general are well described by single stellar populations ( ssp , i.e. coheval ensembles of stars that share the same metallicity ) , are for the most part old objects , with ages @xmath11 gyr ( as referenced in the introduction ) . fittingly , the observed gc ages put the epoch of their appearance squarely at the peak of the cosmic star formation history , determined to be at redshifts @xmath22 ( hopkins @xmath12 beacom 2006 , bouwens et al . 2009 ) .",
    "third , the mean metallicity of the gc population is observed to be higher in more massive galaxies , with a @xmath20_{gc}$ ] parallel to that of the galaxy mass - metallicity relation ( see for instance larsen et al .",
    "2001 , peng et al .",
    "2006 , ct et al .",
    "1998 ) , in support of the idea that the gc population is closely related to the main stellar component and is similarly affected by halo mass and environment , i.e. more massive galaxies form their bulk of their stars later , from more enriched gas .",
    "we assume that the old globular cluster population ( ages @xmath11 gyr ) were formed in galaxies at the peak of their star formation activity , likely @xmath23 galaxies , at all redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "note that , following this assumption , the older globular clusters formed at higher redshifts in smaller systems , and with a lower metallicity .",
    "this is in accord with observations , that estimate metal - poor gcs to be about @xmath24 gyr older than metal - rich gcs ( dotter et al .",
    "2011 , puzia et al .",
    "2005 , woodley et al .",
    "2010 ) , although the precision of the age measurement for extragalactic gcs is too low to confidently discriminate ages differences at this level ( strader et al .",
    "we assume as likely candidates for the formation sites of gcs either the massive star - forming clumps observed in high redshift ( @xmath10 ) galaxies ( shapiro et al .",
    "2010 ) , or the central regions of galaxies subject to episodes of violent dissipative collapse . in both cases ,",
    "the clumpiness and turbulence of the gas plays a fundamental role in boosting the star formation and producing gcs , along with the galaxy main stellar component ( shapiro et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the frequency of globular clusters @xmath25 is defined as the number of gcs per unit galaxy mass of @xmath26 , and at @xmath27 it is constrained by observations ( peng et al .",
    "2008 ; see also spitler et al .",
    "2008 , rhode et al . 2007 , rhode 2012 ) . in the galaxies in the merger tree , @xmath25 depends on the interplay of different factors , like the mean gas density ( which depends on the depth of the galactic potential well ) , the metallicity , the feedback regime , and the competing regular star formation that feeds the main stellar component . in lack of other observational constraints , we assume that the redshift @xmath27 observed relation @xmath28 holds at all redshifts , so that the total number of local gcs that each galaxy produces is @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , galaxies below @xmath30 do not form globular clusters , consistently with the observed @xmath28 relation ( peng et al .",
    "2008 ) , which yields @xmath31 for @xmath32 ( see also muratov @xmath12 gnedin , 2010 ) .",
    "we also assume that , once formed , the local gcs stabilise themselves in dynamical equilibrium with the galaxy , and therefore remain kinematically coupled with the main stellar component .",
    "we follow the evolution of the merger tree from redshift @xmath33 , when the galaxy main progenitor forms its local globular clusters .",
    "we assume the epoch is @xmath34 .",
    "the main progenitor is likely to have a rich gas component and is near the peak of its star formation history ; it has a stellar mass @xmath35 and a mean total metallicity @xmath36 , which follows the galaxy mass - metallicity relation @xmath20 $ ] at @xmath37 . in each monte",

    "the number of local gcs in the main progenitor is @xmath39 .",
    "the main progenitor is the most massive galaxy in the merger tree , and is the last one to have its globular cluster population in place . at this point in time",
    ", the satellites in the merger tree , which by definition have masses @xmath40 , have already formed their own gcs , and we put such epoch of formation around @xmath4 ( see also shapiro et al .",
    "each satellite metallicity follows the galaxy @xmath20 $ ] at that epoch , and in each satellite of mass @xmath41 the gc metallicity is peaked around the current galaxy mean metallicity @xmath42 , while the number of gcs is @xmath43 .",
    "we assume a gaussian distribution of the gc metallicities in each satellite , peaked around @xmath42 with @xmath44 , which takes into account the combined effect of the scatter in the gc metallicity in each satellite ( @xmath45 ) , plus an additional uncertainty ( @xmath45 ) due to the scatter in the star formation histories of satellites ( sensitive to environment for instance ) , which affect the satellite s metallicity and the exact epoch of gc formation .",
    "the main progenitor @xmath35 evolves into the @xmath8 galaxy @xmath14 through two main channels : by accreting stellar mass in the form of satellites , and by forming stars locally . if we define as @xmath46 the mass in stars that are formed inside the main progenitor at any time _ after _ the gc formation ( including merger - triggered star formation ) ,",

    "this provides us with a series of merger candidates ; each of them is weighted with the mean merger rate , which represents the probability for a merger to happen , given the mass of the main progenitor @xmath53 , the ratio between the masses of the satellite and the main progenitor @xmath54 , and the redshift :    @xmath55 ( 1+\\rm z)^{\\eta } ~,\\ ] ]    where the best - fit parameters are characterised as @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( fakhouri et al .",

    "old globular clusters are considered fossil records of the galaxy where they were formed , and their finally metallicity distribution is exclusively a result of the hierarchical galaxy assembly . the factors that affect the final metallicity distributions are 1 ) the evolution of the galaxy mass - metallicity relation , which _ completely _ determines the position of the metal - rich and metal - poor peaks , and 2 ) the merger history ( therefore the environmental density ) and the star formation history , which _ completely _ determine the relative strenghts of the metal - poor and metal - rich peaks .",

    "unrelated to the particular values of the metal - rich and metal - poor peaks , the model predicts the relative height of the peaks to give an insight into the assembly and star formation history of the galaxy : for a given galaxy mass , a dominant metal - rich peak indicates a quiet merger history and/or a significant growth of the galaxy through local star formation , as opposed to a mass growth driven by accretion of satellites .",

    "<S> 1 ) the hierarchical clustering scenario naturally predicts a metallicity bimodality in the galaxy globular cluster population , where the metal - rich subpopulation is composed of globular clusters formed in the galaxy main progenitor around redshift @xmath3 , and the metal - poor subpopulation is composed of clusters accreted from satellites , and formed at redshifts @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> ( 2006 ) for the metallicities of the metal - rich and metal - poor globular cluster subpopulations as a function of galaxy mass ; the positions of the metal - poor and metal - rich peaks depend exclusively on the evolution of the galaxy mass - metallicity relation and the @xmath5 $ ] , both of which can be constrained by this method . in particular , we find that the galaxy @xmath5 $ ] evolves linearly with redshift from a value of @xmath6 at redshift @xmath1 to a value of @xmath7 at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) for a given galaxy mass , the relative strenght of the metal - rich and metal - poor peaks depends exclusively on the galaxy assembly and star formation history , where galaxies living in denser environments and/or early types galaxies show a larger fraction of metal - poor clusters , while galaxies with a sparse merger history and/or late type galaxies are dominated by metal - rich clusters . </S>",
