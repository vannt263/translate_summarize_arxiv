    "neutron stars are ideal astrophysical laboratories .",
    "their extreme properties demand an interdisciplinary approach , while most of the existing models attempt to synthesize the various features that neutron stars are predicted to possess .",
    "+ of particular interest is the construction of numerical solutions for equilibrium configurations of magnetized neutron stars with realistic assumptions about their interior structure .",
    "the hachisu self - consistent field method ( hscf ) @xcite is the starting point of many modern methods for constructing ( initially non - magnetized ) equilibria .",
    "this method was extended by @xcite so that magnetic fields with a strong poloidal and a weak toroidal component were included . @xcite and @xcite further extended the methods , using a two - fluid description , including type - ii superconductivity for the neutron star core . in these latter models ,",
    "the star is divided in two regions , the superconducting core and the normal infinitely conducting crust .    here , we also take into account , for the first time in such numerical models , the effect of entrainment .",
    "this comes by assuming an interaction between the momenta of the two fluids , resulting in an additional force acting on neutrons , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "furthermore , because the number of equations to be solved has increased , we show that the simple convergence criteria introduced in @xcite are no longer adequate .",
    "we present new convergence criteria , related to fundamental quantities of the model and show how one obtains more accurate numerical solutions .",
    "although our code is built in a way that it is possible to numerically evaluate both purely poloidal and mixed poloidal - toroidal equilibrium models , we focus here on the case of purely poloidal fields .",
    "the reason for doing so is that in these models @xmath0 .",
    "we compute models with entrainment for a magnetic field strength of @xmath1 at the pole and compare to corresponding models without entrainment , that were previously obtained in @xcite .    in the following sections we first briefly discuss entrainment",
    ", then we describe the model .",
    "we demonstrate our new convergence criteria along with the numerical method and finally we provide results for equilibria with and without entrainment , and compare these .",
    "it is theorized that neutron stars exhibit entrainment , a phenomenon occurring in the case of mixed fluids . due to entrainment ,",
    "the momenta of the components are coupled , which means that the momentum of each component is dependent on both fluid velocities .",
    "thus , if a component is flowing , the other component will flow as well .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite the entrainment can be simply described through a dimensionless function @xmath2 defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are _ entrainment coefficients _ , satisfying , by definition , the relation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the proton and neutron mass densities .",
    "we here consider the slow - rotation approximation , neglecting rotation related terms in the equations of hydrostationary equilibrium as the shape of the star is still spherical .",
    "the coefficient @xmath5 can be written in terms of the bare proton mass @xmath9 and the effective mass @xmath10 acquired by each proton as a result of the entrainment , as @xmath11 and thus @xmath2 can be written as @xmath12 where we have set @xmath13 , which depends on the density and thus on the equation of state . in general , @xmath14 varies depending on the model taken into account . some of these models are discussed in @xcite . here , we assume that it is constant throughout the core .",
    "notice that in the case that @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the entrainment effect vanishes .",
    "entrainment allows neutrons to experience a magnetic force .",
    "normally , this force would be absent since neutrons are neutral and thus do not interact with the magnetic field . however , since the protons are assumed to be superconducting and the neutrons superfluid , the drag between the proton and neutron fluid components provides a mechanism of interaction between neutrons and the magnetic field , which is enacted through the entrainment force on neutrons @xcite .",
    "working in newtonian framework we assume a magnetized , axisymmetric neutron star in a stationary state .",
    "the axis of symmetry is parallel to the magnetic dipole axis .",
    "the star is assumed to have only two regions : the core and the crust .",
    "the core , a region that starts at the center and extends to roughly 90% of the radius of the star ( the crust - core boundary ) , is assumed to consist of superfluid neutrons and type - ii superconducting protons , where the protons are subject to a magnetic force different from the normal ideal mhd case , while neutrons will also be subject to a magnetic force due to entrainment .",
    "the crust , which lies between the crust - core boundary and the surface of the star , is composed of normal matter , which is subject to the standard lorentz force . the crust is assumed to be in a relaxed state , without tangential stresses and can thus be described as a single fluid . outside the star we assume vacuum . for purely numerical convenience",
    "we adopt the crust model described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the future , using realistic equations of state , it should be possible to adopt more realistic proton and neutron fractions throughout the star . however , for evaluating the entrainment effects in the core , the assumptions made for the crust are not crucial .",
    "we express the main equations in cylindrical coordinates @xmath17 while in the numerical implementation we use spherical polar coordinates @xmath18 .",
    "vector components are expressed with respect to the unit vectors @xmath19 while we provide some results in both dimensionless form and gauss - cgs units .      in the core",
    ", we need to consider two separate equations for the hydrostationary equilibrium ( obtained by setting the neutron and proton velocities equal to zero in the general mhd equations presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the neutron and proton chemical potentials and @xmath23 is the gravitational potential ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath24 is the magnetic force acting on protons and @xmath25 is the magnetic force on neutrons due to entrainment .",
    "we will discuss chemical potentials , as well as the form of the magnetic force in the following sections .",
    "the gravitational field is related to the total density @xmath26 through @xmath27 we subtract ( [ sceullann ] ) from ( [ sceullanp ] ) to find @xmath28 which we use along with ( [ sceullanp ] ) ( instead of using ( [ sceullanp ] ) and ( [ sceullann ] ) ) . since all quantities on the left side of ( [ sceullann ] ) and ( [ sceullanp ] ) are gradients of scalars , the same must hold for the right side , so @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 are scalar functions .",
    "this result is useful , since ( [ sceullanp],[sceullandif ] ) then admit first integrals @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are some integration constants .",
    "the above first integrals will be used in the numerical implementation . the magnetic field @xmath37 needs to satisfy the divergence free constraint @xmath38 which implies that in axisymmetry it can be decomposed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the streamfunction describing the magnetic field .",
    "the system is closed with an equation of state in terms of an energy functional , which will be discussed in the next section .      in the two - fluid description ,",
    "equations ( [ sceullann ] ) , ( [ sceullanp ] ) are formulated in terms of the chemical potentials @xmath41 instead of the pressure @xmath42 .",
    "we assume an equation of state in terms of the _ energy functional _ @xmath43 given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 are constants , and @xmath46 are the polytropic indices for neutrons and protons respectively .",
    "this is essentially an extension of the usual polytropic equation of state .",
    "the chemical potentials are defined through    @xmath47    and @xmath48    in the limit of a single - fluid description , one recovers the usual equations in terms of pressure , by @xmath49      we assume type - ii superconductivity for the protons in the core .",
    "thus , the magnetic force is no longer the familiar lorentz force , but it is replaced by a flux tube tension force @xcite @xmath50 ,    \\label{scmagforce }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the first critical field given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the unit tangent vector to the magnetic field ( @xmath54 ) , with @xmath55 the norm of the magnetic field .",
    "the norm of the first critical field is approximated by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is some constant and @xmath2 is the entrainment function ( [ estar2 ] ) .",
    "the neutron force @xmath25 is given by @xmath58 this force on neutrons exists due to the coupling of proton and neutron flows at the vicinity of each fluxtube .",
    "these flows exist on a mesoscopic level and are different from the macroscopic fluid velocities which enter the fluid motion equations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we define @xmath59 and @xmath60 as    @xmath61    and @xmath62    if @xmath2 is constant , then @xmath63 and hence @xmath64 . in that case , the force acting on neutrons vanishes . combining ( [ scnablaneqfn ] ) and ( [ fn ] ) it is obvious that @xmath65 we extend the derivation for the type - ii superconducting equivalent of the grad - shafranov equation for the magnetic field @xcite in the case that @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 while functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 are defined through @xmath71 @xmath72 we note here that the contribution of the neutron force @xmath25 to the grad - shafranov equation is implicit .",

    "we discuss the form for the @xmath37 field in the crust region .",
    "there , we assume normal , perfectly conducting matter and hence , the governing equations are those of the ideal mhd used in the first part .",
    "the magnetic force is @xmath76 while the neutron force vanishes @xmath77 the grad - shafranov equation for this case is @xmath78 where we have denoted the functions @xmath79 with subscript n to distinguish them from their superconducting counterparts . it can be shown that both @xmath80 and @xmath81 are functions of @xmath40 .",
    "as in the superconducting case , @xmath81 is related with the toroidal part of the magnetic field @xmath82 through @xmath83      the exterior of the star is assumed to be a perfect vacuum , since we have not assumed the presence of a magnetosphere .",
    "therefore , the matter density vanishes in the outer region and the equation governing the magnetic field is @xmath84 it is possible to model a magnetosphere by assuming that part of the toroidal component of the magnetic field exceeds the surface of the star , as presented in @xcite .      for specifying the various regions of the neutron star , as well as the boundary conditions",
    ", we use the same assumptions as in @xcite , modified in a way that entrainment is included .",
    "the surface of the neutron star is defined by the contour of vanishing proton density @xmath85 with a corresponding radius @xmath86 in the equatorial plane .",
    "the core of the neutron star extends from the center out to the proton density contour that is at a radius @xmath87 in the equatorial plane , which also defines the crust - core boundary @xmath88 the crust is the region extending between the above crust - core boundary and the surface of the star .",
    "the first boundary condition to be met is the continuity of the magnetic force on the crust - core boundary ( we denote the crust - core boundary using the cc subscript ) @xmath89_{\\rm cc } = \\left [ \\rho_{\\rm p}^{\\rm   crust}\\bm{\\nabla } m_{\\rm n}\\right]_{\\rm cc}.   \\label{scbound1 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting ( [ yfun ] ) in ( [ scbound1 ] ) and assuming that @xmath80 is a function of @xmath40 only , we obtain ( see [ apboundcond ] ) @xmath90_{\\rm cc } = \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{\\rm d \\it y}{\\rm d \\it u } - 4\\pi   \\frac{\\rho_{\\rm p}^{\\rm   crust}}{\\rho_{\\rm p}^{\\rm   core } }   \\frac{\\rm d \\it m_{\\rm n}}{\\rm d \\it u } \\right ) \\bm{\\nabla } u\\right]_{\\rm cc}.   \\label{scbound1a }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is obvious that @xmath91 .",
    "since we do not know @xmath55 as a function of @xmath40 on the core - crust boundary explicitly , we will use a polynomial approximation for @xmath92 , denoted by @xmath93 , employing the exact same scheme as in @xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 are constants and @xmath96 is the equatorial value of @xmath40 on the crust - core boundary .",
    "the constants are chosen in such a way that the polynomial values coincide with the numerical ones at the pole and equator .",
    "since we chose a second degree polynomial , a third point is needed as well , which we choose to be at the middle of the @xmath97 direction ( @xmath98 ) .",

    "we use the hachisu self - consistent field ( hscf ) method @xcite as presented by @xcite with new convergence criteria to specify the equilibrium .",

    "the system of equations is more complex , requiring a larger number of iterations to achieve convergence . in order to ensure that all quantities relevant for the solution have converged , we introduce three new convergence quantities related to the proton density @xmath7 , the neutron density @xmath8 and the magnetic function @xmath40 .",

    "all of the above quantities should converge to zero .",
    "the first two are sensitive to the convergence of the fluid properties , while the last one is sensitive to the convergence of the magnetic field .",
