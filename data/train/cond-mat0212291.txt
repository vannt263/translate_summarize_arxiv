    "the literature on this subject is rather poor .",
    "based on debye - hckel approximations for the electrostatic interactions and including lateral correlations by considering different typical semiflexible polyelectrolyte - layer structures , netz and joanny@xcite found a remarkable stability of the periodic structure of the multilayers in planar geometry . for weakly charged flexible polyelectrolytes at high ionic strength qualitative agreements between theory @xcite , based on scaling laws , and experimental observations",

    "the driving force of all these multilayering processes is of electrostatic origin and it is based on an overcharging mechanism , where the first layer overcharges the macroion and the subsequent layers overcharge the layers underneath . however , the role of non - electrostatic interactions though pointed out in ref .",

    "[ fig.nr_single_chain ] ) indicates that the adsorption of pc monomers ( at given @xmath51 ) is weaker when an additional pa is present .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the pc chain tends to build up a globular state by getting complexed to the pa chain .",
    "this feature is well illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.snap_two_chain ] .",
    "more precisely , for sufficiently small @xmath67 , the polyelectrolyte globular state is highly favorable compared to the `` flat '' bilayer state ( see also fig .",

    "this a non - trivial result , since naively one would expect a `` true '' multilayering for any @xmath51 .",
    "it is only for large @xmath70 that one gets a true bilayer formation , where there is a pronounced peak in @xmath69 around @xmath71 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the following dimensionless interaction parameters @xmath72 , which measures the strength of the macroion - pc electrostatic attraction , and @xmath73 which controls the pc - pa complex interaction . for large values of @xmath74 the bulk complex",
    "will always be in a globular state , since then the coulomb interaction will give rise to a chain collapse , similar to those seen in polyelectrolyte systems .",
    "thus , for a sufficiently large value of @xmath75 at given @xmath51 , the globular state will always be favorable and no bilayering can occurs . in this case _ unwrapping _ occurs , similarly to the microstructures depicted in fig . [ fig.snap_two_chain](a ) and fig . [",
    "fig.snap_two_chain](b ) .",
    "on the other hand , we find at fixed parameters @xmath74 and @xmath76 , that one needs a s sufficiently large value @xmath77 , in order to achieve bilayering .",
    "one can summarize these important results as follows :    * the equilibrium _ bilayering _ process on a spherical charged colloid with long polyelectrolyte chains requires a sufficiently strong extra short - ranged macroion - pc attraction",
    ".    a closer look on fig .",
    "[ fig.nr_two_chain](b ) reveals a further non - trivial behavior in the profiles of @xmath78 at high @xmath51",
    ". very close to the macroion surface we always have a monotonic behavior of the fraction of adsorbed pc [ @xmath79 and pa monomers [ @xmath80 with respect to @xmath51 as it should be . however , for a certain distance away from the surface we observe an unexpected behavior where @xmath81 as well as @xmath82 .",
    "one can qualitatively explain this effect by the onset of the formation of one ( or several ) polyelectrolyte microglobule(s ) , i.e. , small cluster(s ) of oppositely charged monomers [ see figs .",
    "[ fig.snap_two_chain ] ( d ) and ( e ) ] .",
    "this is indeed possible because at high @xmath51 in principle more pc ( and consequently also pa ) monomers want to get close to the macroion surface .",

    "compared to bulk conformations the chain entropy is roughly reduced by @xmath83 . here @xmath84 is the effective number of conformational degrees of freedom of a bond , giving that @xmath85 . thus local microglobules that induce a small local desorption , are entropically much more favorable .",
    "also , on the level of the energy , an increase of @xmath84 concomitantly favors the pc - pa microglobule .    the net fluid charge @xmath43 is reported in fig.[fig.qr_two_chain ] . for @xmath86 the macroion",
    "gets even overcharged and undercharged as one gets away from its surface , whereas for low @xmath51 no _ local _ overcharging occurs . again , at high @xmath51 the strength of the charge oscillation is not a monotonic function of @xmath51 where we observe a higher local overcharging ( and undercharging ) with @xmath87 than with @xmath88 .",
    "this latter feature is fully consistent with the profiles of @xmath78 [ see fig . [",
    "fig.nr_two_chain](b ) ] previously discussed @xcite . however this onset of local ( surface ) microglobules ( for @xmath88 ) is not strong enough to produce a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath89 with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "we now turn to the case where there are many polyelectrolytes ( with @xmath90 ) in the system .",
    "we recall that when @xmath91 , the vdw interaction concern monomers of all pcs lying within the range of interaction . to keep the number of plots manageable",

    "in addition we observe several globally neutral polyelectrolyte complexes in the bulk , whose number decreases with @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.snap_n_short_chain ] ) .",
    "this feature was inhibited for long chains due to the strong pc - pa binding energy that keeps all the chains near the macroion surface . at sufficiently strong @xmath51",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig.snap_n_short_chain](c ) with @xmath88 ] , the macroion area gets largely ( and _ uniformly _ ) covered by the pc chains , leading to a strong bilayering .",
    "nevertheless , due to the weak pc - pa binding energy , the formation of additional layer seems to be prohibited in contrasts to what was observed at @xmath87 with systems @xmath110 and @xmath102 that contain a similar number of monomers .",
    "those observations lead us to the relevant conclusion that multilayering with short chains ( if experimentally observed on a charged colloidal sphere ) must involve additional non - trivial driving forces like specific pc monomer - pa monomer interactions that are not captured by our model .",
    "this again seems to be in agreement with the arguments presented in ref.@xcite which argue against a stable thermodynamic equilibrium complex when there is excess polyelectrolytes present .",
    "the net fluid charge plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.qr_n_short_chain ] indicates that only one charge oscillation ( around the isoelectric point ) is obtained in contrast to what can happen with longer chains .",
    "again , here the driving force for the bilayer formation is the overcharging that increases with @xmath51 .",
    "we have carried out mc simulations to study the basic mechanisms involved in forming equilibrium polyelectrolyte complexes on a charged colloidal sphere .",
    "this work emphasizes the role of the short - range van der waals - like attraction ( characterized here by @xmath51 ) between the spherical macroion surface and the oppositely charged adsorbed chain(s ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that , for the bilayering process involving two long oppositely charged chains at fixed @xmath74 and @xmath76 , it is necessary to have a sufficiently high @xmath51 . in particular , below a certain value of @xmath117 , a dense adsorbed polyelectrolyte globule is obtained , whereas above @xmath77 a flat bilayer builds up .",
    "the same qualitatively applies to the case of many ( more than two ) long polyelectrolytes . in a purely electrostatic regime (",
    "i.e. , @xmath58 ) one can never obtain a true ( uniform ) multilayering .",
    "however , by increasing @xmath51 , one gradually increases the polyelectrolyte ( polycation and polyanion ) chain adsorption ultimately leading to a true multilayering where the macroion is uniformly covered .",
    "nonetheless , at given @xmath51 and especially for small @xmath51 , the polyelectrolyte globular state is always favored when its net charge is zero .",
    "as far as the short chain case is concerned , it was shown that even bilayering can not be reached within the pure electrostatic regime . only at higher @xmath51 ( higher than those coming into play with long chains ) ,",
    "one recovers a bilayer formation .",
    "however , multilayering ( beyond bilayering ) with very short chains seems to be very unlikely within our model",
    ". the large complex would not be thermodynamically stable and dissolve into smaller charge neutral polyelectrolyte complexes , consistent with the ideas presented in ref.@xcite .    as an overall conclusion , our results clearly demonstrated that besides an overcharging driving force [ i.e. , successive macroion ( effective ) charge reversal by successive polymer layering ) , the stability of the polyelectrolyte multilayer is strongly influenced by the specific macroion - polyelectrolyte short range attraction .",
    "this statement should at least hold for the investigated cases of equilibrium structures",
    ".    a future study should systematically study other important effects , such as chain flexibility , specific interchain monomer - monomer interaction , microions valency etc ... nevertheless , our present findings hopefully will generate some further systematic studies to explore the effects of non - electrostatic effects for the layer - by - layer deposition technique ."
