    "figure 3 shows the oscillatory behavior of @xmath78 for this value of @xmath44 .",
    "as @xmath44 grows , the spectrum starts to overlap with @xmath4 .",
    "we note that , in the case of the sub - ohmic environment , the diffusion coefficient presents oscillations for all values of @xmath44 , but it attains negative values only when @xmath81 .",

    "our non - markovian theory , however , shows that for times @xmath84 , the average energy of the system oscillator may increase , as we will see in detail in sec . v.",

    ", containing four terms characterizing the emission and absorption processes , namely , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "these terms describe the simultaneous creation or annihilation of a quantum of energy both in the system and in the reservoir oscillators .",
    "the energy required for such processes to occur comes from the system - reservoir coupling . by combining these two counter rotating terms , we obtain a process that corresponds to an energy conserving process .",
    "it has been shown that at zero temperature the dynamics of the decay rate for the transitions up originates from these counter rotating terms @xcite .",
    "the decay rates at zero temperature show similar dependence on the parameter @xmath44 as the one discussed in the high temperature case .",
    "in particular , for @xmath81 both @xmath89 and @xmath90 oscillate attaining negative values , a clear signature of the non - markovian behavior of the system . compared to the high @xmath24 case , oscillations in @xmath90 obtaining negative values are present also for higher values of @xmath44 , e.g. @xmath50 , for all reservoir types . for the super - ohmic environment",
    "the decay rates show a strong initial jolt for all values of @xmath44 .",
    "having in mind the form of the spectral distributions one sees that the initial jolt is present whenever the peak of the spectrum lies in the frequency region @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath92 the decay rate @xmath90 , describing @xmath93 transitions in the system oscillator , approaches zero as expected from the markovian theory , while @xmath89 , describing @xmath94 transitions , reaches a constant positive value @xmath95 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : channels10 ] for the @xmath51 case .",
    "an interesting aspect worth mentioning is visible in the super - ohmic case for @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ fig : channels10 ] clearly shows that for the super - ohmic spectrum the decay rate @xmath89 , i.e. the cooling rate of the system oscillator , approaches its small but nonzero constant value already for @xmath96 , while at the same time the decay rate @xmath90 , describing heating of the system oscillator , attains negative value and tends to zero while remaining negative .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in correspondence to negative regions of the time dependent coefficients , in our case @xmath97 , reverse transitions restoring the previous quantum state occur . in view of these results",
    "one can argue that , in the case considered above , the up channel acts like a transition down channel .",
    "this implies that the thermalization is achieved via a reverted transition up channel , while the actual transition down channel is almost completely closed .    in the next section",
    "we will see how the behavior of the decay rates is related to the heating dynamics of the quantum brownian particle and we will investigate the differences in the dynamics of the mean energy of the system due to different environments .",

    "we begin by looking at the markovian dynamics describing the time evolution for times much greater than the reservoir correlation time .",

    "and we can express the reservoir thermalization time , in units of @xmath4 , as follows @xmath108    from fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalization ] we see that , for both the sub - ohmic and the ohmic reservoirs , the thermalization time decreases monotonically for increasing values of @xmath44 , i.e. for increasing values of the cutoff frequency with respect to the frequency of the system oscillator @xmath4 . on the contrary , for the super - ohmic reservoir ,",
    "there exist a value of @xmath44 , namely @xmath109 , minimizing the thermalization time . in general ,",
    "all the three reservoir types considered in this paper are such that the thermalization time grows rapidly when @xmath110 , and correspondingly the thermalization process is notably slowed down .",
    "our analysis suggests that , by appropriately changing the cutoff frequency of a high temperature engineered reservoir , it is possible to control the thermalization dynamics .",

    "this is clearly related to our choice of the initial condition @xmath104 . in this case indeed , for times much shorter than the thermalization time , the absorption of a quantum of energy from the environment ( heating ) dominates over the opposite process , i.e. , the emission of a quantum of energy into the environment ( cooling ) .      for high temperature reservoirs , eq .",
    "can be further approximated by @xcite @xmath112 the sign of @xmath28 determines whether the heating function grows monotonically or exhibits an oscillatory behavior . in more detail , when @xmath28 oscillates taking negative values then the heating function oscillates .",
    "the oscillations in the heating function appear when the system gives back to the reservoir some of the energy that had previously been absorbed from it .",
    "in other words , the direction of the energy flow is reversed during the time periods in which the slope of @xmath113 is negative .",
    "these oscillations are a sign of the non - markovian dynamics and are due to the finite reservoir memory that allows the partial and temporary recovery of some of the information / energy lost in the reservoir .",
    "equation ( [ eq : hightn ] ) links the heating function to the diffusion coefficient dynamics . in the previous section",
    "we have seen how the structure of the reservoir , and in particular some specific system - reservoir parameters , determine the temporal behavior of @xmath28 . by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hightn ] ) we can now establish a connection between the reservoir spectrum and the heating process and compare the non - markovian heating for the sub - ohmic , ohmic and super - ohmic reservoirs .        from fig .",
    "6 one sees clearly that the non - markovian heating , described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hightn ] ) , presents two main types of behavior : an oscillatory behavior and a monotonic growth similar to the markovian heating . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that , for an ohmic reservoir and for @xmath49 , oscillations in @xmath114 originate from the low frequency part of the spectrum while the monotonic heating is caused by the resonant part of the spectrum , namely by the value of @xmath82 .",
    "this connection between the features of @xmath114 and the spectrum seems to hold also for the three reservoir types discussed in this paper .",
    "indeed , for @xmath115 the decay rates @xmath28 are always positive giving rise to monotonic heating .",
    "moreover the bigger is the value of @xmath82 , the faster is the non - markovian monotonic heating rate . for @xmath50 ,",
    "e.g. , the monotonic heating occurs at approximately the same rate for all the reservoir types corresponding to the fact that @xmath82 is the same for all the reservoirs .",
    "the connection between the low frequencies of the spectrum and oscillations in the heating dynamics can be illustrated by considering the cases where oscillations are present , i.e. , for @xmath116 .",
    "this is the parameter region where @xmath28 obtains temporarily negative values giving rise to oscillations in @xmath114 . for these values of @xmath44",
    "the peaks of all the three spectral distributions are positioned in the low frequencies region , indicating that the presence of oscillations and the low frequency part of the spectrum are intertwined .",
    "oscillations in @xmath114 mark the presence of non - markovian memory effects .",
    "the persistence of non - markovian effects for a given value of @xmath44 ( e.g. , @xmath116 for high @xmath24 reservoirs ) depends on the type of reservoir spectrum .",
    "figure 6 shows that the memory effects persist for much longer times in the sub - ohmic reservoir than in the other reservoir types .",
    "this indicates that , when dealing with sub - ohmic reservoirs , a non - markovian approach might be needed also at time scales where , for the ohmic and super - ohmic environments , a markovian treatment is sufficient .",
    "we have now illustrated the main features of the non - markovian heating dynamics of qbm for high temperatures . in the next section",
    "we will briefly summarize the corresponding results for the zero temperature case .",
    "when the system oscillator , initially prepared in its ground state , interacts with a zero temperature reservoir , the dynamics of the heating function is basically due to the finite , although small , system - reservoir coupling energy . at zero temperatures , and for short times",
    ", the heating function dynamics is linked to the decay coefficient @xmath90 via eq . .",
    "the non - markovian dissipative dynamics of qbm at zero @xmath24 is qualitatively similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "6 for high @xmath24 reservoirs . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ decayzerot ] , the coefficient @xmath90 , associated to the heating rate of the system oscillator , tends to zero for times much greater than the reservoir correlation time , as expected from the markovian theory .",
    "after the initial non - markovian heating , the system will eventually thermalize with the zero temperature reservoir .    similarly to the case of high @xmath24 reservoirs , also at low temperatures oscillations in @xmath114 vanish as @xmath44 becomes @xmath117 .",
    "now , however , this typically non - markovian feature is present for greater values of @xmath44 than in the high @xmath24 case , e.g. , also for @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that non - markovianity is present for a wider range of @xmath44 , in the case of a zero temperature reservoir , is in agreement with what found in ref .",
    "@xcite for a ohmic reservoir with lorentz - drude cutoff .",
    "in this paper we have presented analytical results on the dynamics of a quantum brownian particle interacting with different types of bosonic thermal reservoirs .",
    "our approach makes it possible to identify in a clear way the microscopic physical processes taking place at short non - markovian times scales and to link them to the spectral properties of the environment . by comparing the effects that different types of environments have on the quantum system",
    ", we can identify those physical contexts where a non - markovian approach is required in the description of the time evolution .",
    "moreover we can predict the type of reservoir that perturbs less the quantumness of the system of reference , in our case the harmonic oscillator , and the value of the parameters for which this occurs .",
    "we have seen indeed that the decay and heating rates for the qbm depend strongly on the reservoir type , and in particular on the ratio @xmath44 between the cutoff frequency @xmath45 and the frequency of the system oscillator @xmath4 .    the time dependent coefficients appearing in the master equation and in the heating function are connected via eqs . and",
    "for both zero and high @xmath24 reservoirs . the heating dynamics for both temperature regimes",
    "shows a similar dependence on the parameter @xmath44 . in general oscillations in the heating function , a typical non - markovian feature ,",
    "are present for @xmath116 . for zero temperatures , however ,",
    "these oscillations are also present for @xmath118 .",
    "so for all the types of environment considered , zero @xmath24 reservoirs are inherently more non - markovian than high @xmath24 reservoirs .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated that the sub - ohmic reservoir induces more pronounced and longer lasting non - markovian dynamics compared to the other reservoir types and gives rise to a faster markovian heating in the resonant case ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath114 indicate a back and forth exchange of energy between the system and the reservoir .",
    "in particular , when the the slope of @xmath114 is negative , the system gives back some of the excitation received previously from the reservoir .",
    "the statistical ensemble of system oscillators is , in general , colder than the reservoir with whom it interacts , since we assumed throughout the paper that the system is prepared in its ground state .",
    "oscillations in the heating function therefore indicate the possibility of a temporary energy flow from a cooler object to a hotter one due to the memory of the environment .",
    "this is not a surprise .",
    "the monotonic evolution of the system density operator to its equilibrium value , which is a universal property of quantum dynamical semigroups ( spohn s theorem ) @xcite , is in general violated at short ( non - markovian ) timescales .",
    "this anomaly has been proposed to be used to control the thermodynamics of an atomic system simply by changing the way in which it is measured @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that by means of reservoir engineering techniques , e.g. , by changing the parameter @xmath44 , one could modify the thermalization dynamics of the system .",
    "another intriguing possibility stemming from reservoir engineering is the simulation of paradigmatic models of open quantum systems as the one discussed in this paper .",
    "schemes for simulating qbm with trapped ions were presented in refs .",
    "a similar approach may be used to simulate the sub - ohmic and super - ohmic environments here investigated .",
    "an ideal physical context where our results could be experimentally verified is the trapped ion context .",
    "experiments with single trapped ions have demonstrated the ability to engineer artificial environments and to control the relevant system - environment parameters @xcite .",
    "these experiments aim at measuring the decoherence of a quantum superposition of coherent states and fock states due to the presence of the reservoir .",
    "several types of engineered reservoirs are demonstrated , e.g. , thermal amplitude reservoirs , phase reservoirs , and zero temperature reservoirs @xcite .",
    "a high @xmath24 amplitude reservoir is obtained by applying a random electric field @xmath119 whose spectrum is centered on the axial frequency @xmath120 of oscillation of the ion .",
    "the trapped ion motion couples to this field due to the net charge @xmath121 of the ion : @xmath122 , with @xmath123 displacement of the c.m . of the ion from its equilibrium position . remembering that @xmath124 , with @xmath125 and @xmath126 annihilation and creation operators of the fluctuating field modes , and that @xmath127 the quantized position operator of the ion motion , one realizes that this coupling is equivalent to the bilinear one given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : interactionhamilton ] ) .",
    "the random electric field is applied to the endcap electrodes through a network of properly arranged low pass filters limiting the natural  environmental noise but allowing deliberately large applied fields to be effective .",
    "this type of drive simulates an infinite - bandwidth amplitude reservoir @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that , for the times of duration of the experiment the heating due to the natural reservoir is definitively negligible @xcite .",
    "the different high @xmath24 spectra that we discuss in this paper can be realized experimentally by filtering the random field , used in the experiments for simulating an infinite - bandwidth reservoir , with a suitable set of band - pass filters .",
    "this enables the comparison of the heating rates between different reservoir spectra and the observation of non - markovian effects .",
    "we notice that measurements of the heating function are routinely performed in the trapped ion context .",
    "the heating function is obtained from measurements of the population of the vibrational states of the ion . a detailed study of the experimental techniques to simulate harmonic quantum brownian motion with trapped ions , for the case of an ohmic spectrum with lorentz - drude cutoff has been performed in ref . @xcite .",
    "we believe the methods needed to verify these phenomena are already in the grasp of the experimentalists @xcite .    finally , it is worth recalling that manipulation of the dynamics via certain types of measurements causes the decay processes to be inhibited or accelerated , depending on the system - reservoir properties .",
    "these crucially quantum phenomena , known as quantum zeno ( qze ) and anti - zeno effects ( aze ) , have been studied for the qbm model in the case of an ohmic spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper pave the way to the study of the influence of the reservoir spectrum on the occurrence of quantum zeno or anti - zeno effect ( aze ) .",
    "the borderline between the occurrence of qze or aze is indeed related to the spectral properties of the environment and therefore will depend on the type of reservoir ( ohmic , sub - ohmic , super ohmic ) considered",
    ". a comparative study of the zeno - anti - zeno crossover is thus a natural follow up of this paper .",
