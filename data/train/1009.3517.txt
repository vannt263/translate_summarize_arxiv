    "the thermal conductivity of a metal in the superconducting state is markedly different from its value in the normal state .",
    "the physical reason is that the cooper pairs give no contribution to the transport of heat .",
    "therefore heat transport occurs solely due to the quasiparticle excitations controlled by the energy gap . due to this reason ,",
    "measurements of the thermal conductivity were extensively used during last decades as a tool to probe the energy gap symmetry in various new superconducting materials .",
    "application of a magnetic field @xmath0 provides a way to generate quasiparticles in a type - ii superconductor . in a s - wave superconductor at @xmath1",
    ", the quasiparticles are localized near the vortex cores and thermal conduction perpendicular to the magnetic field is due to tunneling between adjacent vortices . thermal conductivity in the mixed state of superconductors",
    "was extensively studied in the past experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . early theoretical work",
    "@xcite addressed superconductors in diffusive regime ( dirty limit ) in the mixed state with a temperature gradient applied transverse to the magnetic flux .",
    "the electronic thermal conductivity was calculated using the quasiclassical time - dependent superconductivity theory , assuming homogeneous temperature gradient , using the circular - cell approximation , and averaging over the unit cell .",
    "this approach was later extended to study heat transport in various unconventional superconductors .",
    "theory for d - wave superconductors was developed in ref .",
    "for zero magnetic field and in refs .",
    "for the mixed state .",
    "more recently , with the discovery of magnesium diboride ( mgb@xmath2 ) , theory was extended to the case of multiband superconductivity @xcite .",
    "discovery of pnictides , with possibly unconventional pairing mechanism due to spin fluctuations leading to the so - called @xmath3 pairing state , motivated extension of heat transport theory @xcite taking into account multiband superconductivity and resonant interband impurity scattering .",

    "being very sensitive to the gap structure , thermal transport at low magnetic fields varies considerably for different compounds .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider more accurately the problem of the thermal conductivity across the magnetic fields for s - wave superconductors .",
    "the case of s - wave superconductor is a standard reference , all other situations are compared with this case .",
    "surprisingly , an accurate result for the low - field asymptotics of the thermal conductivity was never derived .",
    "the widely - used circular unit cell approximation does not give correct result in low magnetic fields because it misses essential physics .",
    "namely , as the local thermal conductivity is strongly inhomogeneous , the heat transport is limited by tunneling between adjacent vortices across certain local points in the vortex lattice unit cell ( bottlenecks ) .",
    "this leads to general low - field asymptotics of the electronic thermal conductivity , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the upper critical field.@xcite surprisingly , the theoretical value of the numerical constant @xmath11 is not available neither for clean nor for dirty s - wave superconductors . for clean case ,",
    "we provide estimate for this numerical constant using asymptotics of the bogolyubov wave functions of the localized states at zero energy and microscopic value of the upper critical field . in the dirty case we were able to perform more quantitative analysis using the keldysh - usadel formalism .",
    "we calculate the thermal conductance at low temperature and low magnetic field for single- and two - band superconductors in the dirty limit . in this regime",
    "we obtain parameter - free analytical solution in a single - band case which provides theoretical lower limit for heat transport in the mixed state .",
    "we find that in dirty case the low - field thermal conductivity is drastically suppressed in comparison with clean case .",
    "further , we generalize the developed formalism to a two - band superconductor , taking mgb@xmath2 as an example .",
    "the electronic transverse thermal conductivity in mixed state at low temperatures and fields is determined by the probability quasiparticle tunneling between the cores of neighboring vortices . in this section",
    "we evaluate this quantity with exponential accuracy for clean isotropic superconductors . even though this estimate is very straightforward and",
    "could be done long time ago , to our great surprise , we did not succeed to find it in the literature .",
    "the bogolyubov wave function of the localized state in the vortex core at @xmath12 decays as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the superconducting gap and @xmath15 is the fermi velocity .",
    "therefore , the probability of tunneling between the vortex cores separated by distance @xmath16 can be estimated as @xmath17 the upper critical field @xmath10 for a clean isotropic superconductor at @xmath18 is given by @xcite @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the euler constant .",
