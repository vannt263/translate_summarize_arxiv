    "there are several reasons to search for a variation of the fundamental `` constants '' of nature in space and time .",
    "first , the universe is evolving ; several phase transitions happened in the early universe accompanied by dramatic changes in vacuum energy , fundamental masses , fundamental interactions ( electromagnetic , weak , and strong ) and properties of elementary particles ( e.g. , confinement of quarks ) . at",
    "later stages the equation of state of the universe continued to evolve , from radiation domination ( pressure @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the energy density ) , to cold - matter domination ( @xmath11 ) , and `` recently '' , about 5 billion years ago , to dark - energy domination ( @xmath12 ) . in view of these dramatic changes",
    "it seems natural to check if there is any evolution in the values of the fundamental constants during this process .",
    "a second reason is that spatial variation can explain a fine - tuning of the fundamental constants which allows humans ( and any life ) to appear .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that if the values of some fundamental constants ( e.g. , related to the strong interaction ) would differ by even 1% we could not appear .",
    "if we assume that the fundamental constants vary in space , this problem of fine - tuning may be resolved in a most natural way : we appeared in the area of the universe where the values of the fundamental constants are consistent with our existence .",
    "a third reason comes from theories unifying gravity and other interactions .",
    "some theories suggest the possibility of spatial and temporal variation of physical `` constants '' in the universe ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there exists a mechanism for making all coupling constants and masses of elementary particles both space- and time - dependent , and influenced by local circumstances .",
    "the variation of coupling constants can be non - monotonic ( e.g. , damped oscillations ) .",
    "we can only measure the variation of dimensionless parameters which do not depend on the units we use . in the standard model the two most important dimensionless parameters are the fine structure constant @xmath13 and the ratio of the electroweak unification scale ( determined by the higgs vacuum expectation value ) to the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) scale @xmath14 ( defined as the position of the landau pole in the logarithm for the running strong coupling constant , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the variation of the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) leads to the variation of the electron mass @xmath16 and quark mass @xmath1 which are proportional to the higgs vev .",
    "the present work considers effects produced by the variation of @xmath3 where @xmath17 is the average current - quark mass .    up to",
    "now a majority of publications about temporal and spatial variation of the fundamental constants have considered effects of variation of @xmath18 .",
    "however , the hypothetical unification of all interactions implies that the variation of the strong interaction parameter @xmath3 may be larger than the variation of the electromagnetic @xmath18 .",
    "for example , the grand unification theories ( guts ) discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite predict @xmath19 the coefficient here is model - dependent but large values are generic for grand unification models in which variations come from high energy scales ; they appear because the running strong - coupling constant and higgs constants ( related to mass ) run faster than @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , the electroweak ( i=1,2 ) and strong ( i=3 ) inverse coupling constants have the following dependence on the scale @xmath20 and normalization point @xmath21 : @xmath22 in the standard model , @xmath23 ; the electromagnetic @xmath24 and the strong @xmath25 . in guts",
    "all coupling constants are equal at the unification scale , @xmath26 .",
    "we may consider two possibilities : if we assume that only @xmath27 varies , then eq .  ( [ eqn_inv_alpha ] )",
    "gives us the same shifts for all inverse couplings : @xmath28 we see that the variation of the strong interaction constant @xmath29 at low energy @xmath20 is much larger than the variation of the electromagnetic constant @xmath18 , since @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the second possibility is the variation of the gut scale ( @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_inv_alpha ] ) ) .",
    "this gives @xmath33 note that in this case the variations have different signs since @xmath34 and @xmath35 have different signs .",
    "however , we expect an even larger enhancement of the variation of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .    the variation of @xmath38 can be estimated from the definition of @xmath14 .",
    "the running of @xmath39 near the electroweak scale is given by @xmath40 let us take @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43-boson mass .",
    "the variation of eq .",
    "( [ lalphas ] ) and relations above give @xmath44 the value of the constant @xmath45 here depends on the model used .",
    "however , the enhancement @xmath46 should make the factor @xmath47 large .",
    "note that @xmath42 ( as well as @xmath48 ) is proportional to the higgs vev .",
    "if this estimate is correct , the variation in @xmath49 may be easier to detect than the variation in @xmath18 .",
    "the cosmological variation of @xmath50 can be extracted from the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , quasar absorption spectra and oklo natural nuclear reactor data  @xcite .",
    "for example , the factor of three disagreement between the calculations and measurements of the bbn abundance of @xmath8li may , in principle , be explained by the variation of @xmath50 at the level of @xmath51 @xcite ( see also recent work  @xcite ) . the claim of the variation of the fundamental constants based on the oklo data in ref .",
    "@xcite is not confirmed by recent studies  @xcite which give a stringent limit on the possible variation of the resonance in @xmath52sm during the last two billion years .",
    "the search for the variation of @xmath53 using the quasar absorption spectra gave a non - zero result in ref .",
    "@xcite but zero results in refs .",
    "the present time variation of @xmath49 can be extracted from comparison of different atomic  @xcite and nuclear  @xcite clocks .",
    "the review of the recent results on the variation of @xmath18 , @xmath53 and @xmath50 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as we mentioned above",
    ", one can measure the variation of the dimensionless parameter @xmath3 . note that @xmath54 4 mev @xmath55 220 mev . as a result ,",
    "nuclear parameters ( nucleon mass , reaction cross - sections , etc . ) are determined mainly by @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , in all calculations it is convenient to assume that @xmath14 is constant and calculate the dependence on the small parameter @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , we measure all masses in units of @xmath14 and will simply restore @xmath14 in the final results . for example",
    ", the relation between the variation of the proton mass and quark mass @xmath56 should be understood as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath3 .",
    "this approach was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "predictions for the relations between the variations of quark and hadron masses may come from a variety of approaches , such as chiral perturbation theory  @xcite or dyson - schwinger equations ( dse )  @xcite .",
    "nuclear binding energies and spectra would vary as a consequence of the hadron mass variation , affecting a number of physical processes , such as bbn and the oklo phenomenon .",
    "large enough changes might alter the stability of some nuclei , e.g. , unbind the deuteron , bind the dineutron , or even make @xmath59=5,8 nuclei particle - stable  @xcite . in this work",
    "we estimate the changes in binding for @xmath59=2 - 8 nuclei that result from small changes in hadronic masses .",
    "we also evaluate the effect of much larger changes on the two - nucleon systems , which may be relevant to present attempts to extrapolate results from lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "we first consider how changes in meson , nucleon , and nucleon - resonance masses would alter some representative nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath60 ) hamiltonians .",
    "we then solve for the energy of the two - body systems exactly and calculate variational monte carlo ( vmc ) estimates for the larger nuclei with these forces .",
    "we report our results as derivatives of the energies with respect to the different hadron mass changes , so that the results can be utilized with different predictions of the coordinated changes between quark and hadron masses .",
    "finally , we utilize the dse predictions for hadron mass - dependence on the quark mass as an example to explore the effects on nuclear spectra and bbn .",
    "we examine several hamiltonians of the form : @xmath61 here @xmath62 is a nonrelativistic kinetic energy operator , @xmath63 is a two - nucleon potential , and @xmath64 is a possible three - nucleon potential .",
    "we consider three different argonne models for @xmath63 : argonne  @xmath65 ( av14 ) and argonne  @xmath66 ( av28 ) from 1984  @xcite , and argonne  @xmath67 ( av18 ) from 1995  @xcite . in conjunction with av18",

    "the av14 and av28 were constructed together and fit to the same @xmath69 phase - shift solution wi81 of arndt and roper  @xcite so they are phase - equivalent .",
    "the intention was to use them in parallel many - body calculations to study the effect of including explicit @xmath70 s in the nuclear hamiltonian . in practice , av28 has proven difficult to use , so beyond the two - nucleon system , only some triton  @xcite and nuclear matter  @xcite calculations have been reported .",
    "however , av14 has been widely used in a variety of few - body  @xcite and dense nucleon matter  @xcite calculations .",

    "there is a weaker ope coupling strength , a slightly different form factor , and the small charge - dependent ( cd ) terms owing to the difference between neutral and charged pion masses are kept .",
    "the intermediate - range attraction is due primarily to two - pion - exchange ( tpe ) processes ; in av14 and av18 this feature is approximated by using the square of the ope tensor function @xmath75 as a phenomenological radial shape for @xmath76 and adjusting strength parameters of the 14 or 18 operators to fit data . in av28 ,",
    "14 operators with explicit @xmath60@xmath77@xmath78 couplings are added to those of av14 ; twelve of these have ope range and two have intermediate and short range .",

    "the coefficients of the first 14 @xmath60 operators are refit to the data but are smaller in magnitude than in av14 .",

    "increasing the @xmath70 mass in av28 reduces the binding energy both through the one - body term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ki ] ) and through the coupled - channel effects of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath208 has a sign opposite to @xmath209 . to approximate this affect for av14",
    ", we can again multiply its intermediate - range strength parameters @xmath139 by a factor @xmath141 .",
    "we take @xmath210 which gives a fair reproduction of the behavior of av28 for both the deuteron and the virtual bound state as shown by the line in table  [ tab : two ] labeled `` @xmath143 '' . using the same factor in av18",
    "again produces a larger rate of change .",
    "we note that if the nucleon and @xmath70 masses change at about the same rate , from whatever the underlying quark mass dependence , then the effect on the av28 energies could be obtained by the sum of the @xmath133 and @xmath130 terms in table  [ tab : two ] , which is not very different from the @xmath133 term alone for av14 and av18 or from the sum of @xmath207 and @xmath143 terms .",
    "in fact , these corresponding sums of terms agree within 10 - 20% for all three models .",
    "increasing the pion mass reduces the regularized ope tensor function @xmath211 at all values of @xmath212 .",
    "the binding of the deuteron is primarily due to the tensor coupling , so @xmath198 is reduced and @xmath213 is negative for all the models as shown by the line in table  [ tab : two ] labeled `` @xmath214  ( ope ) '' .",
    "the value for av28 is larger because of the multi - pion - exchange effects included through the generalized ope potential .",
    "the av14 and av18 values are smaller and close together , the difference between them being proportional to the different @xmath215 coupling constants used in the two models .    increasing @xmath214 in the @xmath170s@xmath205 channel , which depends only on @xmath216 , has the effect of slightly increasing the attraction in the virtual bound state , making @xmath217 negative for the av14 and av18 models .",
    "however , in the av28 model , the generalized ope provides significant intermediate - range attraction @xmath218 ^ 2 $ ] , which is enough to reverse the sign of @xmath217 to be positive . as the av14 and av18 cases here are the only two out of seventeen in table  [ tab : two ] that violate the relation between @xmath213 and @xmath217 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vbs ] ) , it appears that changing only the ope part of a conventional @xmath60 potential like av14 or av18 is an incomplete representation of the physics in the singlet channel .",
    "changing @xmath214 in the static tpe part of the interaction has a more dramatic effect than changing just the ope part , as shown in table  [ tab : two ] by the line labeled `` @xmath214  ( + tpe - s ) . ''",
    "the @xmath213 increases by by a factor of 2.54 in the deuteron for the av14 and av18 models compared to ope only , while for av28 it increases by a smaller factor of 1.5 .",
    "more dramatically , the av14 and av18 values for @xmath219 change sign and come into agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : vbs ] ) .",
    "the further addition of the non - static `` @xmath214  ( +",
    "tpe - l ) '' terms makes no difference to the virtual bound state , as these operators do not contribute in the @xmath170s@xmath205 channel , and rather small changes in the deuteron .",
    "finally , increasing the heavy - meson mass @xmath168 reduces the range of the woods - saxon repulsion and increases the binding of the deuteron , so @xmath213 is positive .",
    "the reduced repulsion for the virtual bound state correspondingly makes @xmath219 negative . in both the full - pion and heavy - meson exchanges , the av18 has larger @xmath220 values than av14 or av28 .",
    "again , this is probably due to the weaker ope and compensatingly larger intermediate - range attraction and short - range repulsion .",
    "the multi - nucleon results for @xmath197 are given in table  [ tab : av14 ] for av14 and table  [ tab : av18uix ] for av18+uix .",
    "for every nucleus , and for every @xmath193 component , the signs are the same as for the deuteron .",
    "the relative sizes of the terms are also about the same as the deuteron , with the exception of the @xmath214  ( ope ) term . because the light nuclei have approximately equal numbers of deuteron - like and @xmath170s@xmath205-like pairs  @xcite , the @xmath197",
    "are expected to be averages of the two sets of trends in table  [ tab : two ] .",
    "the anomalous behavior of @xmath219 in the @xmath214  ( ope ) case discussed above causes these numbers to be much smaller in the multi - nucleon systems , and thus out of proportion compared to all the other terms . as for the deuteron ,",
    "the multi - nucleon terms have a more rapid dependence with av18+uix than with av14 . however , the explicit @xmath214 contribution from the three - nucleon force is very small .",
    "as an example of how to incorporate our nuclear binding energy results with a specific prediction for hadronic mass variation , we utilize the results of a dyson - schwinger equation study of sigma terms in light - quark hadrons  @xcite .",
    "equations ( 85 - 86 ) of that work gives the rate of hadron mass variation as a function of the average light current - quark mass @xmath221 as : @xmath222 with @xmath223 values of 0.498 for the pion , 0.030 for the @xmath79-meson , 0.043 for the @xmath80-meson , 0.064 for the nucleon , and 0.041 for the @xmath70 .",
