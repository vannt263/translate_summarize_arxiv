    "reactions involving particles which may recombine only when some third substance - the catalytic substrate - is present @xcite , but otherwise remain chemically inactive , are ubiquitous in nature and also widely used in a variety of technological and industrial processes . within the past two decades",
    "much effort has been put in understanding the peculiarities of such catalytically - activated reactions ( cars ) . in particular",
    ", considerable theoretical knowledge was gained from an extensive study of a particular reaction scheme - the co - oxidation in the presence of metal surfaces with catalytic properties @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "remarkably , refs.@xcite have substantiated the emergence of an essentially different behavior as compared to the predictions of the classical , formal - kinetics scheme and have shown that under certain conditions such collective phenomena as phase transitions or the formation of bifurcation patterns may take place @xcite .",
    "prior to these works on catalytic systems , anomalous behavior was amply demonstrated in other schemes @xcite , involving reactions on contact between two particles at any point of the reaction volume ( i.e. , `` completely '' catalytic sysems ) .",
    "it was realized @xcite that the departure from the text - book , formal - kinetic predictions is due to many - particle effects , associated with fluctuations in the spatial distribution of the reacting species .",
    "this suggests that , similar to such `` completely '' catalytic reaction schemes , the behavior of the cars may be influenced by many - particle effects .",
    "apart from many - particle effects , the behavior of the cars might be affected by the very structure of the catalytic substrate , which often can not be considered as being a well - defined geometrical object , but represents rather an assembly of mobile or localized catalytic sites or islands , whose spatial distribution is complex @xcite .",
    "metallic catalysts , for instance , are often disordered compact aggregates , the building blocks of which are imperfect crystallites with broken faces , kinks and steps .",
    "usually only the steps are active in promoting the reaction . in porous materials with convoluted surfaces , such as ,",
    "e.g. , silica , alumina or carbons , the effective catalytic substrate is also only a portion of the total surface area because of the selective participation of different sites in reaction . finally , for liquid - phase cars the catalyst can consist of active groups attached to polymer chains in solution .",
    "such complex morphologies render the theoretical analysis difficult .",
    "there are only a few available studies which concern disordered substrates such as found in the co - oxidation scheme ; here the disorder is believed to affect mainly the particles adsorption and desorption @xcite . on the other hand , for the situations in which the spatial distribution of the catalyst is random , only empirical approaches have been used , based mostly on heuristic concepts of effective reaction order or on phenomenological generalizations of the formal - kinetic `` law of mass action '' ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the important outcome of such descriptions is that they provide an evidence of the existing correlations between the morphology of the chemically reactive environment and reaction kinetic and steady - state properties . on the other hand ,",
    "their shortcoming is that they do not explain the mechanisms underlying the anomalous kinetic and stationary behavior . in this",
    "regard , exact analytical solutions of even somewhat idealized or simplified models , are already highly desirable since such studies may provide an understanding of the effects of different factors on the properties of the cars .",
    "in this paper we study the catalytically - activated annihilation @xmath0 reaction in a simple , one - dimensional model with different ( regular or random ) distributions of the catalysts , appropriate to the just mentioned situations with the catalytically - activated reactions assisted by the active groups attached to polymer chains .",
    "more specifically , we consider here the @xmath0 reaction on a one - dimensional regular lattice which is brought in contact with a reservoir of @xmath1 partilces .",
    "some portion of the lattice sites ( marked by crosses in fig.1 ) possesses special `` catalytic '' properties such that they induce an immediate reaction @xmath0 , when at least one of two neighboring adsorbed @xmath1 particles sits on a catalytic site . in this case",
    "these two particles react and instantaneously leave the chain .    in regard to the distribution of the catalytic sites ,",
    "we focus here on three different situations .",
    "first , we consider the case when the catalytic sites are placed periodically , forming a regular sublattice .",
    "next , we turn to the disordered case .",
    "we analyse first the case of annealed disorder and furnish an exact solution .",
    "lastly , we analyse the behavior in the most complex case of quenched disorder , for which situation an exact solution is also derived .",
    "we note finally that the kinetics of @xmath0 reactions involving @xmath8 @xmath1 particles which react upon encounters on randomly placed catalytic sites has been discussed already in refs.@xcite and @xcite , and a rather surprising behavior has been found , especially in low - dimensional systems . a much simplier equilibrium model of an @xmath0 reaction on a 1d chain with",
    "randomly placed catalytic segments has been solved in refs.@xcite and @xcite , by noticing that here the average pressure per lattice site coincides exactly with the lyapunov exponent of a product of random two - by - two matrices , obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "additionally , the steady - state properties of contact @xmath0 reactions between diffusive @xmath1 particles , or @xmath0 reactions between immobile @xmath1 particles reacting via long - range reaction probabilities in systems with external particles input have been presented in refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively , which analysis has revealed non - trivial ordering phenomena with anomalous input intensity dependence of the mean particle density .",
    "this anomalous behavior agrees with earlier experimental observations @xcite . for completely catalytic 1d systems ,",
    "the kinetics of @xmath0 reactions with immobile @xmath1 particles undergoing cooperative desorption has been discussed in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "exact solutions for @xmath0 reactions in 1d completely catalytic systems in which @xmath1 particles perform conventional diffusive or subdiffusive motion have been presented in refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we formulate our model and introduce the basic notations .",
    "next , in section 3 we focus on situations with regular placements of catalytic sites .",
    "we calculate exactly the partition function of the model , the pressure per site , and present as well explicit results for the particles mean density in the thermodynamic limit from which we determine the compressibility of the system . in section 4",
    "we study the behavior of the system in the case of random @xmath2 distributions of the catalytic sites .",
    "we show that in this case the model reduces to a one - dimensional lattice gas with an effective three - particle repulsive interaction .",
    "we develop a combinatorial formulation of the model which allows us to obtain an exact solution .",
    "we present thus an exact expression for the disorder - averaged pressure , as well as exact asymptotic expansions for the mean particle density and the compressibility . in section 5",
    "we turn to the very complex situation where the random distribution of catalytic sites is @xmath3 . for this case , averaging the logarithm of the partition function over the states of the quenched random variables describing the catalytic properties of lattice sites , we find that the problem reduces in finite lattices with a fixed number of catalytic sites to an exact enumeration of all possible interconnected clusters .",
    "the weights of such clusters are calculated exactly in terms of a certain combinatorial procedure , and we find eventually an exact expression for the disorder - averaged pressure in the quenched disorder case .",
    "additionally , we evaluate exact asymptotic expansions for the mean - particle density and the compressibility .",
    "we show that the behavior of these properties differs substantially , depending on whether the disorder is annealed or quenched .",
    "in particular , in systems with annealed disorder the mean particle density tends to unity when the chemical potential @xmath9 for any @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mean density of catalytic sites . on the other hand ,",
    "mean particle density in the quenched disorder case tends to a finite value @xmath12 as @xmath9 .",
    "as well , in the @xmath2 disorder case the compressibility appears to be a non - monotonic function of @xmath11 for any @xmath13 , while in the quenched disorder case the compressibility shows a non - monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath11 only for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the temperature .",
    "lastly , in section 6 we conclude with a summary of results . details of intermediate calculations are summarized in the appendices a , b and c.",
    "consider a one - dimensional , regular lattice containing @xmath16 adsorption sites ( fig.1 ) , which is brought in contact with a reservoir of identical , non - interacting , hard - core @xmath1 particles - a vapor phase , maintained at a constant chemical potential @xmath13",
    ". the @xmath1 particles from the vapor phase can adsorb onto vacant adsorption sites and desorb back to the reservoir .",
    "the occupation of the `` i''-th adsorption site is described by the boolean variable @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 for computational convenience , we also add two special , boundary sites @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and stipulate that these sites are always unoccupied , @xmath21 .     _ one - dimensional lattice of @xmath16 adsorption sites in contact with a vapor phase .",
    "the filled circles denote @xmath1 particles with hard - cores .",
    "the crosses denote the adsorption sites with catalytic properties .",
    "( a ) denotes a `` forbidden '' particle configuration .",
    "the sites @xmath19 and @xmath20 are always unoccupied and non - catalytic , i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath22 . _ ]    suppose next that some of the adsorption sites possess `` catalytic '' properties ( crosses in fig.1 ) in the sense that they induce an immediate reaction @xmath0 between neighboring @xmath1 particles ; that is , if at least one of two neighboring adsorbed @xmath1 particles sits on a catalytic site , these two particles react and instantaneously leave the chain ( desorb back to the reservoir ) . to specify the catalytic sites , we introduce the quenched variable @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 the sites at the extremities of the chain are supposed to be non - catalytic , i.e. @xmath25 and @xmath26 . as for the segment",
    "@xmath27 $ ] , we will consider several possible ways of spatial placement of catalytic sites , namely , regular and random .",
    "for a given distribution of catalytic sites , the partition function @xmath28 of the system under study can be written as follows : @xmath29 where the summation extends over all possible configurations @xmath30 , @xmath13 is the chemical potential which accounts for the reservoir pressure and for the particles preference for adsorption .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 stands for the catalytic activity , which is here taken to be infinitely large .",
    "such a choice implies that the reaction between two neighboring @xmath1s , in which pair at least one of @xmath1s sits on a catalytic site , takes place instantaneously .",
    "note that here @xmath28 is a functional of the configuration @xmath32 .",
    "we stop to note that an analysis of general reaction and diffusion problems was previously done using effective hamiltonians of spin systems .",
    "examples are , e.g. , the works by doi @xcite , zeldovitch and ovchinnikov @xcite , alcaraz et al @xcite and simon @xcite .",
    "our procedure here is different in that we consider equilibrium systems and take the limit @xmath33 , which allows us to present the basic results in closed form .",
    "now , taking into account that @xmath34 and setting @xmath35 we can rewrite eq.([partition ] ) as : @xmath36 hence , any two neighboring sites @xmath37 and @xmath38 appear to be coupled by a factor @xmath39 when at least one of these sites is catalytic .",
    "these coupling factors are depicted in fig.1 as arcs connecting neighboring sites and signify that configurations @xmath30 in which the occupation variables @xmath17 and @xmath40 assume simultaneously the value @xmath41 are excluded . we introduce now the notion of `` cluster '' , as being a set of sites , all connected to each other consecutively by arcs .",
    "thus , a @xmath42-cluster contains @xmath42 sites .",
    "note that the boundary between adjacent clusters is given by a pair of two neighboring non - catalytic sites , i.e. by two consecutive variables @xmath23 and @xmath43 which are both equal to zero ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "now , the chain decomposes into disjunct clusters , and consequently , the partition function @xmath28 factorizes into independent terms , such that each one depicts its corresponding cluster",
    ".    it may be also instructive to rewrite eq.([partition ] ) in terms of the ising - type spin variables @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 . in terms of these variables , @xmath28 of eq.([partition ] ) reads : @xmath46 where @xmath11 denotes the mean density of catalytic sites , @xmath47 , while @xmath48 consequently , the model under study can be also thought of as a version of a one - dimensional ising - type model with site - dependent magnetic fields and site - dependent couplings ( see , e.g. , some seminal works @xcite , as well refs.@xcite and @xcite for a recent review ) . note , however , that in our case both the fields and the couplings are non - local , and that the local energy @xmath49 , @xmath50 , can assume several different values , depending on the occupation variables of the neighboring sites and on their catalytic properties .",
    "we close this section by mentioning the results of the conventional mean - field approach , which depicts the evolution of our system @xcite . discarding correlations between the occupation of neighboring sites ,",
    "i.e. setting @xmath51 , one writes the following balance equation @xmath52 where the overdot denotes the time derivative , @xmath53 stands for the elementary reaction constant , @xmath11 is the mean density of catalytic sites ( introduced to account for the reduction in the reaction rate due to the partial chain coverage by catalytic sites ) , while the second and the third terms on the rhs of eq.([meanfield ] ) correspond to the usual langmuir adsorption / desorption events ; here @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the adsorption and desorption rates , respectively , @xmath56 .    equation ( [ meanfield ] ) has the following equilibrium solution @xmath57 in the limit @xmath58 , ( which is the limit of interest in the present paper ) , and with @xmath11 and @xmath54 kept finite one finds that @xmath59 ; from eq.([no ] ) @xmath60 vanishes as @xmath61 . in the following we proceed to show that the actual behavior of the mean density of the @xmath1 particles turns out to be very different from eq.([no ] ) ; this is due to the emerging correlations between the @xmath1 particles .",
    "note also that in the limit @xmath62 ( suppressed reaction ) , one recovers from eq.([no ] ) the classic langmuir result @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "evidently , the factors @xmath76 in eq.([partition2 ] ) are non - overlapping ( see fig.2 ) ; then the partition function decomposes into elementary three - clusters centered around each catalytic site and ( possibly ) into uncoupled , `` free '' sites , i.e. sites unaffected by any of the factors @xmath76 . on the other hand , in the cases @xmath77 and @xmath75 we deal with totally interconnected clusters , spanning the entire chain , as one can deduce from fig.3 .",
    "in fact , the role of @xmath77 and @xmath75 is , chemically speaking , identical .",

    "_ ]      in the case @xmath73 the partition function in eq.([partition2 ] ) decomposes into the product @xmath79 where the superscript `` ( reg ) '' signifies that we deal with the regular case , and where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , are the partition functions of one- , two- and three - clusters , while @xmath84 , @xmath85 , stands for the numbers of such clusters in the @xmath16-chain , respectively . now : @xmath86 - \\delta\\big(\\frac{n - 1}{l},\\big[\\frac{n - 1}{l}\\big]\\big ) ; \\;\\;\\ ; { \\cal n}_2 = 1 + \\delta\\big(\\frac{n - 1}{l},\\big[\\frac{n - 1}{l}\\big]\\big),\\ ] ] and @xmath87\\big ) - 3 \\big[\\frac{n - 1}{l}\\big],\\ ] ] where we have used the evident `` conservation '' law @xmath88 note , however , that the number of the two - clusters is not extensive , i.e. , it does not grow with @xmath16 : such clusters can be present only on the boundaries , i.e. , @xmath89 when @xmath90 is an integer and @xmath91 otherwise .",
    "moreover , @xmath92 and @xmath93 consequently , in the case of a regular , periodic placement of catalytic sites with period @xmath64 , @xmath73 , we can calculate the pressure @xmath94 per site from the relation : @xmath95 which yields : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the density of catalytic sites .",
    "the averaged density of adsorbed particles obeys @xmath98 and hence , in the limit @xmath99 it follows that @xmath100 we stop to note that in the limit @xmath101 ( i.e. that of a completely non - catalytic chain ) eq.([isotherm - reg ] ) reduces to the standard langmuir result . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath102 the number of free - sites in the periodic chain vanishes and the langmuir contribution gets equal to zero ; in this case the chain is composed totally of three - clusters .",
    "in this case , for very large @xmath103 the occupation of lattice sites by adsorbed molecules equals @xmath104 , as it should .    finally , we have that the compressibility @xmath105 , defined as @xmath106 obeys @xmath107 for @xmath101 the last equation reduces to the standard langmuir result , @xmath108 .",
    "we note first that since @xmath109 , we evidently have that @xmath110 we hence conclude that the @xmath77 and the @xmath75 periodic systems are chemically equivalent .",
    "now , we focus on the derivation of the form of @xmath111 according to eq.([partition3 ] ) .",
    "to do this , we proceed as follows : performing first the averaging over the states of the variable @xmath112 , we have that @xmath111 can be written as @xmath113 where @xmath114 obeys @xmath115 and is hence the partition function of a chain consisting of @xmath116 sites .",

    "consequently , the partition function of an @xmath16-site chain obeys the following recursion : @xmath120 whose first three terms are given by eqs.([rec1 ] ) and ( [ rec3 ] ) .",

    "consider next the situation with @xmath151 disorder , which is realized , for instance , when the catalytic property may move ( diffuse ) very quickly . in this case , the disorder - average pressure @xmath152 per site and the average density are given by , respectively , @xmath153 and @xmath154 where @xmath28 is again the partition function of eq.([partition ] ) .",
    "we can now average directly the partition function in eq.([partition ] ) over the placement of the sites with catalytic property : @xmath155 noticing next that @xmath156 and hence , that @xmath157 we find that the averaged partition function in eq.([partition ] ) attains the form @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a boolean variable : @xmath160 evidently , @xmath159 is non - local and depends on the environment of the `` i''-th site . as a matter of fact , the local energy @xmath49 at the `` i''-th site , @xmath161 , assumes @xmath162 different values depending on @xmath40 , @xmath17 and @xmath163 . before we proceed further",

    "the competition ratio @xmath167 equals @xmath168 , which is , in fact , a non - trivial special point ( the so - called multiphase point @xcite ) of the annni model . on the other hand , the fourth term in the exponent corresponds to the three - spin interaction model @xcite .",
    "both models have been extensively studied within the last two decades in various contexts @xcite and show interesting equilibrium and dynamic properties , see e.g. , refs.@xcite .",

    "summing @xmath334 over all the interval realizations @xmath281 obeying the conservation law in eq.([dina ] ) , and using the integral representation of the kronecker function in eq.([delta ] ) , we obtain , after some straightforward calculations , that : @xmath418 while @xmath419 performing next the summation over all possible numbers @xmath295 of subintervals in a @xmath42-cluster , we find that the total number @xmath307 of @xmath42-clusters for all possible realizations of an @xmath16-chain containing a fixed number @xmath273 of non - catalytic sites is given by @xmath420}\\;{k-1-n \\choose n-1}\\;{n - k-1 \\choose n_{nc}-n-1}\\ ; + \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\;\\sum_{n=1}^{[(k-1)/2]}\\;(n_{nc}-n)\\;{k-2-n \\choose n-1}\\;{n - k-1 \\choose n_{n_{nc}}-n-2}\\big\\ } + \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\;\\delta(k , n)\\;\\big\\{2\\sum_{n=1}^{[k/2]}\\;\\delta(n , n_{nc})\\;{k-1-n \\choose n-1}\\;+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\;\\;\\sum_{n=1}^{[(k-1)/2]}\\;\\delta(n , n_{nc}-1)\\;{k-2-n \\choose n-1}\\;+ \\;\\sum_{n=1}^{[(k+1)/2]}\\;\\delta(n , n_{nc}+1)\\;{k - n \\choose n-1}\\;\\big\\}+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\;\\delta(k,1)\\;(1-\\delta(n_{nc},1))\\;(1-\\delta(n_{nc},0))\\;n_{nc}\\;{n-2 \\choose n_{nc}-2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , representing the weights @xmath310 of @xmath42-clusters as @xmath421 where @xmath422 and @xmath423 denote the weights of the `` bulk '' and `` surface '' @xmath42-clusters , respectively , we find , summing over all possible numbers @xmath273 of non catalytic sites , that these weights are defined explicitly by @xmath424}{k-2-n \\choose n-1 } \\sum_{n_{nc}=0}^\\infty ( n_{nc}-n)\\;\\left(\\frac{1-p}{p}\\right)^{n_{nc}}{n - k-1 \\choose n_{nc } -n -2}\\ ] ] and @xmath425}{k-1-n \\choose n-1 } \\sum_{n_{nc}=0}^\\infty \\ ; \\left(\\frac{1-p}{p}\\right)^{n_{nc}}{n - k-1 \\choose n_{nc } -n -1}.\\ ] ] noticing next that @xmath426,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain that @xmath422 obeys @xmath427 } \\left[(1-p)(n - k-1)+2\\right ] { k-2-n \\choose n-1}\\;\\left(\\frac{(1-p)}{p}\\right)^n,\\ ] ] and consequently , in virtue of the definition of the fibonacci polynomials , eq.([fibo ] ) , the total weight of the `` bulk '' @xmath42-clusters can be expressed by @xmath428 \\ ; f_{k-2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{p}{1-p}}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in similar fashion , we find that the total weight of `` surface '' @xmath42-clusters @xmath423 obeys @xmath429 combining these results , we arrive eventually at the general formulae in eqs.([w ] ) and ( [ ww ] ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the limiting behavior of the rather complicated sums entering eq.([calcul ] ) , it is expedient to introduce an auxiliary generating function of the form : @xmath430 where @xmath431 once @xmath432 and @xmath433 are determined , one obtains @xmath356 directly .",
    "as one may verify readily , @xmath356 in eq.([calcul ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath434 as @xmath435 we turn now to the calculation of the generating function in eq.([fonction generatrice ] ) . substituting the explicit form of @xmath310 , eq.([w ] ) , into eq.([gn ] ) , and this in eq.([fonction generatrice ] ) , and interchanging then in the final result the order of summations ( over @xmath42 and @xmath16 ) , we find that @xmath432 can be represented as a sum of two components , @xmath436 where @xmath437 and @xmath438 using next the evident integral equality @xmath439 as well as the explicit expression of the generating function of the fibonacci polynomials @xcite @xmath440 we obtain the following integral representations of @xmath441 and @xmath442 : @xmath443 and @xmath444 now , the asymptotic behavior of behavior of @xmath433 as @xmath445 can be deduced , in a standard fashion , by analysing the critical behavior of the generating function @xmath446 in the vicinity of the singularity closest to the origin @xcite ; that is , here , in the vicinity of @xmath447 . expanding @xmath432 in the vicinity of the singular point @xmath447 , we obtain @xmath448 next , in virtue of the tauberian theorems @xcite , it follows that @xmath433 exhibits the following asymptotical behavior as @xmath445 : @xmath449 and consequently , we find from eq.([inf ] ) that the particular values of the function @xmath433 entering eq.([gs ] ) are given explicitly by : @xmath450 and @xmath451 substituting the results in eqs.([ggs ] ) and ( [ gggs ] ) into eq.([gs ] ) , we thus find that @xmath356 obeys @xmath452 which , in combination with the expression for @xmath453 , eq.([single ] ) , leads to eq.([resultat ] )",
