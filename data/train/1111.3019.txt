    "space missions like galileo for the jovian system or cassini for the saturnian one give us information on the internal structure of the natural satellites , through their gravity fields ( anderson 2001 @xcite ) , observations of their surfaces ( porco et al . 2006 @xcite ) or measurements of their rotational states ( tiscareno et al . 2009 @xcite , lorenz et al . 2008 @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that the internal structure of a body influences its rotational dynamics , especially when this body is locked in a spin - orbit resonance , like the 1:1 resonance for most of the natural satellites of the solar system , and the 3:2 resonance for mercury .",
    "there are at least two ways to approach the modelisation of the interactions between the internal structure and the rotational dynamics .",
    "one way is to complexify the internal structure , taking account for instance of an atmosphere , a deformable crust , a subsurface ocean , an iron core  in a simplified dynamical model that allows to consider only one degree of freedom ( see e.g. rambaux et al .",
    "( 2011 ) @xcite for the longitudinal libration of satellites having an internal ocean , or tokano et al .",
    "( 2011 ) @xcite for the forcing of the polar motion of titan due to its atmosphere ) .",
    "another possibility is to consider a simple internal structure model ( i.e. to assume the body to be rigid ) , in a full dynamical model considering several degrees of freedom ( longitudinal motion , obliquity , and polar motion ) like in ( henrard 2005 @xcite ) .",
    "an evolution of this approach is to consider a two - layer body composed of a rigid mantle and an ellipsoidal fluid core in which the flow is laminar and core - mantle interactions result in pressure coupling at the core - mantle boundary .",
    "this has been originally written by hough ( 1895 ) @xcite and poincar ( 1910 ) @xcite ( that is the reason why this model is sometimes called the poincar - hough model ) , put in hamiltonian form by getino & ferrndiz ( see e.g. @xcite ) under general assumptions , and by touma & wisdom ( 2001 ) @xcite , and recently used for io ( henrard 2008 @xcite ) , mercury ( noyelles et al .",
    "2010 @xcite ) and the moon ( meyer & wisdom 2011 @xcite )",
    ". another model exists , taking account of the elasticity of the mantle ( getino & ferrndiz 1995 @xcite ) .",
    "this case will not be considered here .    in the case of the 1:1 spin - orbit resonance ,",
    "the existing studies do not consider a wide range of internal structure parameter .",
    "this paper aims at contributing to fill the gap to understand the behavior of the system for any size and shape ( provided it is triaxial ) of the core .",
    "the plan of the study is the following : after a description of the model , we present a systematic numerical study of the system with different sizes and shapes of the core , the considered body being an io - like body on a low eccentricity orbit with a uniform nodal regression and constant inclination .",
    "then , `` unusual '' behaviors are highlighted with analytical explanations .",
    "in the study of henrard @xcite , the size of the core was not constrained , but its shape was assumed to be proportional to the whole io .",
    "we here generalize this approach , in letting the shape parameters vary .      [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the fig.[fig : krm48 ] shows the orientation of the angular momentum of the mantle / surface , that does not exhibit this shift .",
    "so , if such a situation would occur ( i.e. very small polar flattening of the core ) , the equatorial / ring plane of the planet could be an acceptable reference plane to describe the orientation of this axis .",
    "in fact , a physical signature of this dynamics remains in the core , we indeed get a mean @xmath0 of @xmath1 arcmin for @xmath2 while we have @xmath3 arcsec for @xmath4 .",
    "in this study we have presented the behavior of a pseudo - io orbit on a low eccentric orbit around its parent planet , with a uniform nodal regression and a constant inclination , in considering it as a two - layer body composed of a rigid mantle and a fluid triaxial core .",
    "this model can be applied to study the rotation of most differentiated natural satellites .",
    "we have described the `` usual '' case , consisting of small oscillations around the expected equilibrium , i.e. synchronous rotation with a small obliquity and no polar motion , but we also have , especially for a highly flattened core , another behavior resulting in a polar motion forced by several degrees .",
    "another peculiar behavior is when the polar flattening of the core is very small . in this last case",
    "we have a forcing of the obliquity of the full body , but not of its mantle , so there should be no observational evidence of this phenomenon . from a mathematical point of view , this could be due to a kind of singularity in the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this study aimed at exploring the behavior of a model , its application to real bodies would require to consider complete ephemerides .",
    "this would add additional forcing frequencies complicating the dynamics of the system .",
    "new behavior can not a priori be excluded .    a possibility to improve",
    "the model would be to consider nonlinear phenomena in the fluid , but this is another story ",
    "numerical simulations were made on the local computing ressources ( _ cluster urbm - sysdyn _ ) at the university of namur ( fundp , belgium ) .",
    "the author is indebted to nicolas delsate and julien frouard for fruitful discussions .",
    "bn is f.r.s .- fnrs post - doctoral research fellow .",
    "the frequency analysis algorithm that we use is based on laskar s original idea , named naff as numerical analysis of the fundamental frequencies ( see for instance laskar 1993 @xcite for the method , and laskar 2005 @xcite for the convergence proofs ) .",
    "it aims at identifying the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 of a complex signal @xmath8 obtained numerically over a finite time span @xmath9 $ ] and verifying      where @xmath7 are real frequencies and @xmath6 complex coefficients .",
    "if the signal @xmath8 is real , its frequency spectrum is symmetric and the complex amplitudes associated with the frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath11 are complex conjugates .",
    "the frequencies and amplitudes associated are found with an iterative scheme . to determine the first frequency @xmath12 , one searches for the maximum of the amplitude of",
    "once the first periodic term @xmath20 is found , its complex amplitude @xmath21 is obtained by orthogonal projection , and the process is started again on the remainder @xmath22 .",
    "the algorithm stops when two detected frequencies are too close to each other , what alters their determinations , or when the number of detected terms reaches a limit set by the user .",
    "this algorithm is very efficient , except when two frequencies are too close to each other . in that case , the algorithm is not confident in its accuracy and stops .",
    "when the difference between two frequencies is larger than twice the frequency associated with the length of the total time interval , the determination of each fundamental frequency is not perturbed by the other ones .",
    "although the iterative method suggested by champenois @xcite allows to reduce this distance , some troubles may remain . in our particular case , these problems are likely to arise because of the proximity between the free frequency of the core @xmath23 and the frequency of the spin .",
