    "the link of each vertex is a triangulated sphere in which each 1cycle consists of at least 3 edges , and if a 1cycle consists of exactly 3 edges , then it bounds a unique triangle . in this case",

    "npc cubing_.    the universal cover of an npc cubed 3manifold is cat(0 ) .",
    "aitchison , matsumoto and rubinstein  @xcite showed by a direct construction that if each edge in an npc cubed 3manifold has even degree , then the manifold is virtually haken .",
    "moreover , aitchison and rubinstein  @xcite showed that if each edge degree in such a cubing is a multiple of four , then the manifold is virtually fibred .",
    "a cube contains three canonical squares ( or @xmath3-dimensional cubes ) , each of which is parallel to two sides of the cube and cuts the cube into equal parts .",
    "these are called _ mid - cubes_. the collection of all mid - cubes gives an immersed surface in the cubed 3manifold @xmath4 if the cubing is npc , then each connected component of this immersed surface is @xmath5injective .",
    "if one could show that one of these surface subgroups is separable in @xmath6 then a well - known argument due to scott  @xcite shows that there is a finite cover of @xmath1 containing an embedded @xmath5injective surface , and hence @xmath1 is virtually haken . in the case where the cube complex is _ special _ ( see  [ sec : cube complexes ] ) , a _",
    "canonical completion and retraction construction _ due to haglund and wise  @xcite shows that these surface subgroups are indeed separable because the surfaces are convex . whence a 3manifold with a special npc cubing is virtually haken .",
    "the missing piece is thus to show that an npc cubed 3manifold has a finite cover such that the lifted cubing is special .",
    "this is achieved in the case where the fundamental group of the 3manifold is hyperbolic by the following cornerstone in agol s proof of waldhausen s virtual haken conjecture from 1968 :    let @xmath7 be a hyperbolic group which acts properly and cocompactly on a @xmath8 cube complex @xmath9 then @xmath7 has a finite index subgroup @xmath10 so that @xmath11 is a special cube complex .",
    "in general , it is known through work of bergeron and wise  @xcite that if @xmath1 is a closed hyperbolic 3manifold , then @xmath12 is isomorphic to the fundamental group of an npc cube complex . however , the dimension of this cube complex may be arbitrarily large and it may not be a manifold .",
    "agol s theorem provides a finite cover that is a special cube complex , and the @xmath5injective surfaces of kahn and markovic  @xcite are quasi - convex and hence have separable fundamental group .",
    "thus , the above outline completes a sketch of the proof that @xmath1 is virtually haken .",
    "an embedding theorem of haglund and wise  @xcite and agol s virtual fibring criterion  @xcite then imply that @xmath1 is also virtually fibred .",

    "whilst we did not succeed , we thank daniel groves and alan reid for their encouragement to nonetheless write up our results , which , in particular , exhibit a @xmath0sheeted cover of @xmath13 in which the canonical immersed surface consists of three embedded surfaces and thus gives a very short hierarchy of @xmath14    weber and seifert  @xcite described two closed 3manifolds that are obtained by taking a regular dodecahedron in a space of constant curvature and identifying opposite sides by isometries .",

    "work of aitchison and rubinstein shows that each immersed hyperplane is mapped @xmath5injectively into @xmath9 hence if one hyperplane is embedded and 2sided , then @xmath20 is a haken 3manifold .",
    "moreover , if each hyperplane embeds and is 2sided , then one obtains a hierarchy for @xmath9 this is well - known and implicit in @xcite .",
    "one may first cut along a maximal union of pairwise disjoint hypersurfaces to obtain a manifold @xmath31 ( possibly disconnected ) with incompressible boundary . then each of the remaining hypersurfaces gives a properly embedded surface in @xmath31 that is incompressible and boundary incompressible .",
    "this process iterates until one has cut open @xmath20 along all the mid - cubes , and hence it terminates with a collection of balls .",
    "in particular , if @xmath21 consists of three pairwise disjoint ( not necessarily connected ) surfaces , each of which is embedded and 2sided , then one has a very short hierarchy .",
    "the main topic of this paper is a study of low - degree covers of the hyperbolic dodecahedral space .",
    "however , we also take the opportunity to extend this study to the spherical dodecahedral space in the hope that this will be a useful reference .",
    "when the sides are viewed combinatorially , there is a third dodecahedral space which naturally fits into this family and again gives a spherical space form : the real projective space .",
    "the combinatorics of these spaces is described in this section .",
    "the weber - seifert dodecahedral space @xmath13 is obtained by gluing the opposite faces of a dodecahedron with a @xmath32-twist .",
    "this yields a decomposition @xmath33 of the space into one vertex , six edges , six pentagons , and one cell ( see figure  [ fig : dodecahedron ] on the left ) .",
    "the dodecahedron can be decomposed into @xmath34 cubes by a ) placing a vertex at the centre of each edge , face , and the dodecahedron , and b ) placing each cube around one of the @xmath34 vertices of the dodecahedron with the other seven vertices in the centres of the three adjacent edges , three adjacent pentagons , and the center of the dodecahedron .",
    "observe that identification of opposite faces of the original dodecahedron with a @xmath32-twist yields a @xmath35-vertex , @xmath36-edge , @xmath37 square , @xmath34-cube decomposition @xmath38 of @xmath13 ( see figure  [ fig : dodecahedron ] on the right ) .",
    "observe that every edge of @xmath38 occurs in @xmath39 cubes , and each vertex satisfies the link condition .",
    "we therefore have an npc cubing .",
    "cubes.[fig : dodecahedron],height=302 ]    .[fig : immersed],height=302 ]    the mid - cubes form pentagons parallel to the faces of the dodecahedron , and under the face pairings glue up to give a 2sided immersed surface of genus two .",
    "we wish to first determine a cover in which the surface first splits into embedded components .      the poincar homology sphere @xmath40 is obtained from the dodecahedron by gluing opposite faces by a @xmath41-twist .",
    "this results in a decomposition @xmath42 of @xmath40 into one vertex , ten edges , six pentagons , and one cell ( see figure  [ fig : poincare ] on the left ) .",
    "again , we can decompose @xmath42 into @xmath34 cubes .",
    "note , however , that in this case some of the cube - edges only have degree three ( the ones coming from the edges of the original dodecahedron ) .",
    "this is to be expected since @xmath40 supports a spherical geometry .    ,",
    "height=264 ]      identifying opposite faces of the dodecahedron by a twist of @xmath43 results in identifying antipodal points of a @xmath15-ball ( see figure  [ fig : poincare ] on the right ) .",
    "hence , the result is a decomposition @xmath44of @xmath45 into ten vertices , @xmath46 edges , six faces , and one cell .",
    "as in the above cases , this decomposition can be decomposed into @xmath34 cubes , with some of the cube - edges being of degree two .",
    "in order to obtain a complete list of all small covers of the weber - seifert , we need a list of all low index subgroups of the @xmath47 in a presentation compatible with @xmath33 and its cube decomposition @xmath38 .",
    "the complex @xmath33 has six pentagons @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "these correspond to antipodal pairs of pentagons in the original dodecahedron , see figure  [ fig : dodecahedron ] on the left . passing to the dual decomposition",
    ", these six pentagons corresponds to loops which naturally generate @xmath47 .",
    "the six edges of @xmath33 , , , , , and   each give rise to a relator in this presentation of the fundamental group of @xmath13 in the following way : fix edge   and start at a pentagon containing , say @xmath48 .",
    "we start at the pentagon labelled @xmath48 with a back of an arrow @xmath54  the outside in figure  [ fig : dodecahedron ] on the left .",
    "we traverse the dodecahedron , resurface on the other pentagon labelled @xmath48 with an arrowhead @xmath55 ( the innermost pentagon in figure  [ fig : dodecahedron ] ) .",
    "we then continue with the unique pentagon adjacent to the center pentagon along edge . in this case",
    "@xmath49 labelled with the tail of an arrow , we traverse the dodecahedron , resurface at @xmath56 , and continue with @xmath57 which we follow through the dodecahedron in reverse direction , and so on .",
    "after five such traversals we end up at the outer face where we started . the relator is now given by the labels of the pentagons we encountered , taking into account their orientation ( arrowhead or tail ) . in this case",
    "the relator is @xmath58@xmath59 .      using this particular representation of the fundamental group of the weber - seifert dodecahedral space we compute subgroups of @xmath47 of index @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) via the ` gap ` function ` lowindexsubgroupsfpgroup ` @xcite , and the ` magma ` function ` lowindexsubgroups ` @xcite and use their structure to obtain explicit descriptions of their coset actions which",
    ", in turn , can then be transformed into a gluing table of @xmath61 copies of the dodecahedron ( or @xmath63 copies of the cube ) .",
    "given such a particular decomposition , we can track how the canonical surface evolves and whether it splits into embedded components .      by a computer search",
    "there are no covers of degrees @xmath3 , @xmath15 , and @xmath64 , and @xmath65 covers of degree @xmath66 .",
    "their homology groups are listed in table  [ tab:1to9 ] . for all of them ,",
    "the canonical surface does not split into embedded components .",
    "moreover , in all but one case it does not even split into multiple immersed components , with the exception being the @xmath66-sheeted cover with positive first betti number described by hempel  @xcite , where it splits into five immersed components .",
    "there are @xmath67 covers of degree six , for @xmath37 of which the canonical surface does not split into multiple connected components ( see table  [ tab:1to9 ] below for their first homology groups )",
    ". however , the single remaining example leads to an irregular cover @xmath68 with deck transformation group isomorphic to @xmath69 , for which the canonical surface splits into six embedded components .",
    "the cover is thus a haken cover ( although this fact also follows from the first integral homology group of @xmath68 which is isomorphic to @xmath70 , see also table  [ tab:1to9 ] ) .        and",
    "the complex is given by gluing six copies @xmath72 of the dodecahedron with the orbits for the six faces as shown in figure  [ fig : fpg ] on the left ( the orientation of the orbit is given as in figure  [ fig : dodecahedron ] on the left ) .",
    "the dual graph of @xmath68 ( with one vertex for each dodecahedron , one edge for each gluing along a pentagon , and one colour per face class in the base @xmath33 ) is given in figure  [ fig : fpg ] on the right .",
    "most of the topological types are determined by the isomorphism type of the subgroups .",
    "the only two non - trivial cases are the lens spaces @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for the former",
    ", we passed to the dual triangulation of the cover of degree @xmath75 using the _ gap_-package simpcomp @xcite , and then fed the result to the @xmath15-manifold software _ regina _ @xcite to determine the topological type of the cover to be @xmath73 .",
    "the latter is then determined by the observation that there is no @xmath3-to-@xmath76-cover of @xmath77 to @xmath73 .",
    "regarding the canonical surface , the situation is quite straightforward . since all edges of @xmath42 , or of any of its covers , are of degree three , the canonical surface is a surface decomposed into pentagonal disks with three such disks meeting in each vertex .",
    "consequently , all surface components must be @xmath3-spheres isomorphic to the dodecahedron , thus have @xmath78 pentagons , and the number of connected components of the canonical surface must coincide with the degree of the cover .",
    "moreover , each surface component runs parallel to the @xmath3-skeleton of a single dodecahedron , and the surface components are embedded if and only if there are no self - intersections of dodecahedra .",
    "the case of the projective space is rather simple .",
    "the only proper cover ( of degree @xmath79 ) is the universal cover of degree @xmath3 .",
    "since the edges of @xmath44 are all of degree two , the canonical surface of @xmath44 has six embedded sphere components , each consisting of two pentagons glued along their boundary , surrounding one of the six pentagonal faces each .",
    "consequently , the universal cover is a @xmath15-sphere decomposed into two balls along a dodecahedron with the canonical surface splitting into twelve sphere components .",
