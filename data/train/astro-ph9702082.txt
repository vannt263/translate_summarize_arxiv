    "earlier this century , einstein and de sitter ( ) suggested that until there was sufficient observational data , progress in constraining the cosmological model could perhaps be best made by focussing discussion on the restricted model that now bears their names . in this einstein - de sitter model , the spatial hypersurfaces are flat , the cosmological constant @xmath14 vanishes , and the universe",
    "is dominated by pressureless matter , so the mass density parameter @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean mass density today , @xmath17 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath18 is the newtonian gravitational constant .    in the 1980s ,",
    "the ideas of inflation and pressureless , cold dark matter led to a more encompassing and far more predictive version of the einstein - de sitter model : the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario ( @xcite ) . in this picture",
    ", inflation explains why the universe is homogeneous on large scales , and quantum fluctuations generated during inflation provide a source of primordial perturbations that can grow through gravitational instability of the cold matter into the galaxies , clusters , and superclusters that are observed today .",
    "the discovery of large - scale anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the experiment ( @xcite ) gave a big boost to the broad picture of structure formation by gravitational instability since it revealed inhomogeneities in the early universe at roughly the level predicted by theoretical models .",
    "however , the dmr results also led to a powerful argument against the simplest version of the cold dark matter model : when normalized to produce the observed level of microwave background anisotropies , the model predicted excessively massive galaxy clusters ( e.g. , wright et al . ; efstathiou , bond , & white ; bahcall & cen ; bartlett & silk ; white , efstathiou & frenk ) .",
    "the level of discrepancy is only a factor of two or three in the fluctuation amplitude , but it reinforces years of accumulating evidence for a difference between the shape of the matter power spectrum predicted by standard cdm and the shapes of the observed power spectra of galaxies and galaxy clusters ( e.g. , bahcall & soneira ; klypin & kopylov ; maddox et al . ;",
    "efstathiou , sutherland & maddox ; eke ) .    in the wake of the results , many variations on the cold dark matter theme have been explored .",
    "arguably , the most attractive of these models are those that retain the assumptions of cold dark matter and an inflationary origin of perturbations but drop the assumption that @xmath7 .",
    "these low density cdm models come in two varieties , spatially flat models with a cosmological constant ( e.g. efstathiou , sutherland & maddox , @xcite ; ganga , ratra , & sugiyama ; liddle et al . ;",
    "@xcite ) , and open models with @xmath19 ( e.g. , @xcite , ; @xcite ) . one can consider models with both space curvature and non - zero @xmath14 , but the observations have not yet driven many theorists to such extremes . within some rather broad ranges of parameters , both flat and open models can accommodate the dmr data on their own .",
    "a key element in tightening the range of acceptable parameters has again been the comparison between the dmr normalization and the predicted masses ( or abundances ) of galaxy clusters .",
    "most implementations of this approach have used semi - analytic computations based on the press - schechter ( ) formalism ( e.g. , white et al . ; @xcite ; eke , cole &  frenk ; @xcite ; kitayama & suto ; viana & liddle ) . in this paper",
    "we use large cosmological n - body simulations to study the cluster mass function in dmr - normalized , open and flat cdm models with @xmath20 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and 1 .",
    "we also compute clustering properties of the non - linear mass distribution in the most promising of these models and in a tilted ( @xmath21 ) @xmath7 model .",
    "variants of the cdm scenario that retain the assumption of @xmath22 are still under discussion .",
    "these variants include the tilted model which we consider , but also may involve a broken primeval fluctuation spectrum , a gravitational wave contribution to the cmb anisotropies observed by @xmath23-dmr , an admixture of hot dark matter , a high baryon fraction , a decaying particle that boosts the neutrino background , or a low hubble parameter  in short , one can fiddle with inflation , fiddle with the matter content , or fiddle with @xmath17 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these models can , to varying degrees , account for the observations and large scale structure , provided that optically bright galaxies are biased with respect to mass by a factor @xmath24 . however , there are two other arguments that generically favour low density models .",
    "first is the combination of recent estimates of the hubble parameter , which favour @xmath25 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath27 ( e.g. , @xcite ; bureau , mould & stavely - smith ; sandage et al . ; riess , press &  kirshner ; @xcite ) , with estimates of globular cluster that imply an age of the universe @xmath28gyr ( @xcite ; salaris , deglinnocenti & weiss ; @xcite ) .",
    "these estimates are difficult to reconcile if @xmath22 .",
    "second is the high baryon fraction in rich clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; henriksen & mushotzky ) ; this is incompatible with @xmath22 if the ratio of baryons to dark matter in clusters is equal to the universal value and constraints on the baryon density derived from standard nucleosynthesis theory and the observed light element abundances are correct ( @xcite ; buote &  canizares ; @xcite ) .    traditional inflation models lead to a spatially flat universe , and hence to @xmath22 if the cosmological constant vanishes . the @xmath14-cdm models are perfectly compatible with standard inflation if one considers a non - zero cosmological constant to be physically reasonable .",
    "open - bubble inflation models ( ratra & peebles , ; bucher , goldhaber & turok ; yamamoto , sasaki & tanaka ) are variants of the scenario suggested by gott ( ) and guth &  weinberg ( ) , in which a spatially - open , inflating bubble nucleates via quantum tunneling within a spatially flat , exponentially expanding ( inflating ) , de sitter spacetime .",
    "the post - nucleation inflation epoch stretches the open bubble to encompass the observable part of the universe , and the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field inside this spatially - open bubble provide the seeds for structure formation .",
    "in the next section we describe our selection of models , with particular attention to the normalization of the linear power spectrum .",
    "we also describe our numerical simulation parameters . in section 3",
    "we compare the mass function of clusters in these simulations to observations .",
    "the models that appear viable after this comparison are the flat models with @xmath29 or 0.4 , and the open models with @xmath30 or 0.5 .",
    "an alternative viable model is @xmath7 with a tilted ( @xmath21 ) primordial power spectrum . in section 4",
    "we present some statistical measures of the clustering of the nonlinear mass distributions in these models : the correlation function , the power spectrum , and the topology of isodensity surfaces .",
    "these analyses do not include any effects of biased or anti - biased galaxy formation , but they give a sense of what sort of biases are needed to reconcile the model simulations with observations . in section 5 we summarize our results and discuss the prospects for distinguishing these models with future observations .",
    "the primary parameter in the two classes of models we consider is the density parameter @xmath3 .",
    "however , the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 also have an influence on the shape of the matter power spectrum , and through this on the amplitude of mass fluctuations for the normalization . in light of recent evidence that tends to favour high values of @xmath31",
    ", we have decided to choose for each open model the value of @xmath31 that gives @xmath33gyr , i.e. , the largest value that leaves the model marginally compatible with standard globular cluster age estimates . might not be unreasonable .",
    "for example , alcock et al . ( ) argue for @xmath34gyr on the basis of a revised rr lyrae distance scale .",
    "a smaller @xmath35 allows for a larger @xmath31 , hence more small - scale power and so lower @xmath3 . ] for each flat-@xmath14 model we choose the value of @xmath31 that gives @xmath36gyr . for @xmath7 models we take @xmath8 .",
    "although our simulations do not include a separately treated baryon component , the value of the baryon fraction has a modest influence ( weaker than the influence of @xmath31 ) on the shape and normalization of the power spectrum . to fix the initial amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum , we adopt @xmath37 , the value advocated by walker et al .",
    "( ) on the basis of the observed light element abundances and standard nucleosynthesis .",
    "recent estimates of the deuterium abundance in high - redshift lyman - limit absorbers suggest that this value may be a factor of two high ( @xcite ; rugers & hogan , b ; see however tytler , burles & kirkman ) or low ( tytler , fan & burles ; @xcite ; see however @xcite ; songaila , wampler & cowie ) .",
    "on the scales modelled by the simulations in this paper , which are much smaller than present values of the hubble or curvature radius , the shape of the energy - density perturbation power spectrum is quite accurately determined by taking account of the usual effects of matter and radiation in processing the primordial energy - density perturbation power spectrum .",

    "( ) . for the flat-@xmath14 models these estimates assume a scale - invariant primordial matter power spectrum ( spectral index @xmath0 in @xmath46 ) , as predicted by the simplest inflation models .",
    "the simplest open - bubble inflation models , which we adopt for our open cdm models in this paper , also produce matter power spectra that have this scale - invariant form on scales much smaller than the present hubble length ( @xcite ) . except for the tilted @xmath7 model ,",
    "our normalizations ignore the possible influence of primordial gravity waves or mild early reionization on the  anisotropies .",
    "there are various ways to analyze the dmr two - year data that lead to slightly different @xmath10 normalizations for a specified cosmological model  one can , for example , use either the ecliptic- or galactic - frame sky maps and either include or ignore the observed quadrupole anisotropy moment ( which is the multipole most sensitive to the galaxy model ) in the analysis ( e.g. , stompor et al . ) .",
    "there is thus no unique central @xmath10 value for a `` dmr - normalized '' cosmological model , but for our purposes the differences between these different methods are not very significant relative to the observational uncertainties in cluster masses discussed below in section 3 .",
    "after we had completed our simulations , results from the analyses of the four - year data ( @xcite , and references therein ) became available .",
    "in addition to new data , these analyses incorporate more sophisticated approaches to removing milky way contamination .",
    "the net effect is a slight downward shift in central estimates of the power spectrum normalization for the models , mostly a consequence of the new ( four - year dmr ) milky way exclusion cut ( @xcite ) .",
    "different combinations of anisotropy maps , treatment of the quadrupole , and corrections for milky way emission again lead to slightly different estimates of @xmath10 ( @xcite , b ) , but relative to the average of these dmr four - year estimates our adopted normalizations are typically high by @xmath47 , on the same order as the 1-@xmath48 dmr four - year data uncertainty .",
    "depending on spectrum and parameter values , the dmr four - year data uncertainty ( including all known systematic uncertainties ) in the @xmath10 normalization is @xmath49 ( 2-@xmath48 ) ( @xcite ) .",

    "we lay down a poisson distribution of @xmath59 particles , then integrate these with the n - body code and sign - reversed gravitational forces until they reach a state at which the gravitational forces on all particles practically vanish . with this approach ,",

    "we apply the zeldovich approximation to this density field to compute displacements and peculiar velocities for the particles , interpolating from the grid to the particle positions .",
    "simulations with glass initial conditions and grid initial conditions yield similar statistical results once they are evolved into the nonlinear regime ( @xcite ) , but simulations with glass initial conditions do not retain a grid signature in uncollapsed regions .",

    "the residual power in the glass configuration is only 0.5% of that in a poisson distribution at the nyquist frequency and drops very rapidly at longer wavelengths ( see figure  a2 of @xcite ) .",

    "second , the fastest moving particle moved less than @xmath72 in one timestep .",
    "initially these two constraints are comparable , but at late times the latter constraint is more stringent , particularly in low @xmath3 simulations .",
    "we monitored energy conservation using the layzer - irvine equation ( equation 12b of @xcite ) and found that for this choice of timestep energy conservation with a fractional accuracy of better than @xmath73% was achieved .",

    "more importantly , the correlation functions of each particle distribution were indistinguishable at scales larger than @xmath74 .",

    "the mass per particle also grows in proportion to @xmath3 , so the masses of the collapsed structures increase more rapidly with @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath10 normalization of the @xmath7 model is only slightly larger than that of the @xmath80 model , but its structure is choppier because its initial conditions have more small scale power ( @xmath55 vs. @xmath81 ) .",

    "the space density of massive clusters is a sensitive function of @xmath3 and @xmath10 .",
    "since these two parameters vary in concert for dmr - normalized cdm models , the cluster abundance can provide a tight constraint on @xmath3 .",
    "more important still , the abundance of clusters as a function of mass can be measured directly from n - body simulations in a way that is insensitive to uncertain assumptions about galaxy formation .",
    "we must assume that galaxies form efficiently enough in cluster - mass potential wells that these are indeed identified as galaxy clusters , but this seems more plausible than the alternative assumption that the universe contains many cluster - mass dark halos that harbour few galaxies and little x - ray emitting gas .",
    "most of the uncertainty in using the cluster abundance as a cosmological test comes from the systematic uncertainties in observational estimates of cluster masses , a point to which we will return later in this section .",

    "this value picks out the high density knots of the mass distribution with overdensity of approximately @xmath87 .",

    "double counting was eliminated by ranking the cluster centres by the mass of the friends - of - friends group and assigning particles to the most massive within @xmath88 .",
    "this is a small correction , and the results are very similar if one simply excludes clusters that lie within @xmath88 of a more massive cluster .    in all models , the abundance of clusters declines rapidly with increasing mass .",
    "clusters are , on average , more massive in models with larger @xmath3 . the number density of clusters of a given mass increases rapidly with @xmath3 ( especially for low @xmath3 ) , and many more clusters are formed in flat universes than in open universes with the same value of @xmath3 .",
    "for example , there are @xmath89 times fewer clusters with @xmath90 in the flat @xmath76 model and @xmath91 times fewer in the open @xmath76 model than there are in the @xmath7 e1 model .",

    "white ( ) give the range @xmath99 for the median mass within the abell radius of @xmath95 abell clusters .",
    "the lower limit comes from estimates using x - ray data and the upper limit from estimates using velocity dispersions of cluster galaxies . as white emphasize ,",
    "the statistical significance of this range is difficult to quantify because most of the uncertainties arise from systematic errors in the mass determinations .",
    "the quoted range is meant to take at least some of these systematics into account .",
    "we adopt a slight modification of this range .",
    "we retain the upper mass limit advocated by white ( ) , but reduce the lower mass limit to @xmath100 .",
    "this lower value follows from two considerations .",
    "first , the reanalysis by eke ( ) of the x - ray data compiled by henry & arnaud ( ) yields an x - ray temperature @xmath101kev for a median @xmath102 cluster rather than the @xmath103kev adopted by white et al .",
    "second , white extrapolated the cluster mass from the virial radius to @xmath88 assuming an @xmath104 density profile .",
    "this extrapolation amounts to a factor of @xmath105 in mass .",
    "if cluster density profiles are significantly steeper at the virial radius , as suggested by navarro , frenk & white ( ) , then a more modest factor is appropriate .",
    "hence we adopt @xmath100 as a conservative lower limit . for masses within @xmath106 , we simply reduce the mass range by a factor of three at the upper and lower ends , which is correct if cluster density profiles are @xmath107 . in practice ,",
    "the estimated masses within @xmath106 are probably more robust than those within @xmath108 , since the x - ray data typically do not extend all the way to @xmath109mpc .",
    "however , we reach similar conclusions about the viability of models using either measure .",
    "in addition to the traditional methods for estimating cluster masses , based on the kinematics of their galaxies and/or on the hydrodynamics of their x - ray emitting gas , a relatively new method , based on the gravitational lensing properties of the cluster dark matter , has recently been applied to several clusters .",
    "the extent to which all three methods give consistent results is still a matter of debate .",
    "all of them require a number of assumptions of varying degrees of plausibility ( see , e.g. , white ) . with standard assumptions , estimates based on velocity dispersions often give somewhat larger masses than estimates based on x - ray data .",

    "the combination of dmr anisotropy and cluster abundance provides an appealing way to constrain the parameters of a cdm universe because , by avoiding explicit reference to galaxies , it bypasses the highly uncertain connection between the large - scale distributions of galaxies and mass .",
    "nevertheless , this test does have a number of important limitations .",
    "the extrapolation of the fluctuation amplitude from the dmr scale to the cluster scale , @xmath157 , requires an assumption about the shape of the primordial mass power spectrum emerging from inflation , e.g. , a scale - invariant ( @xmath0 ) spectrum in flat models or the simplest open - bubble inflation spectrum ( which is close to @xmath0 on scales much smaller than the present hubble length ) .",
    "this shape is not tightly constrained by the dmr data , and because of the large lever arm between the dmr scale and @xmath121 , small changes in the spectral shape can produce large changes in the inferred value of @xmath10 .",
    "this uncertainty is compounded by the fact that in standard flat inflation models even small deviations from @xmath0 can result in a significant contamination of the measured anisotropy signal by tensor modes , which produce gravity waves rather than density fluctuations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath10 from the observed cluster abundance has the great advantage of being essentially independent of the shape of the power spectrum if @xmath7 and of depending only very weakly on it if @xmath158 . the dependence on @xmath52 is also weak ; for @xmath159 , the difference in @xmath10 between flat and open models with the same value of @xmath3 is always less than 10 per cent ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main uncertainty stems from the difficulty in estimating cluster masses reliably .",
    "the expected number of clusters declines very steeply with cluster mass and , as a result , the estimate of @xmath10 , while not requiring a particularly accurate measurement of the abundance of clusters , is very sensitive to the estimates of cluster mass . in this paper , we have adopted a slightly wider range of cluster masses than than quoted by white ( ) for the median mass of @xmath95 abell clusters within the abell radius @xmath160 : @xmath161 .",

    "flat models ( @xmath164 ) require @xmath165 , whereas open models require @xmath166 .",
    "most plausible departures from our assumptions tend to drive these estimates to higher values of @xmath3 .",
    "for example , lowering @xmath17 in order to increase @xmath35 reduces the value of @xmath10 implied by cmb anisotropies but has little effect on the estimate of @xmath10 from the cluster abundance .",

    "increasing the baryon fraction slightly above our standard value has an effect in the same direction , but the impact is substantially weaker than the impact of lowering @xmath17 unless @xmath32 becomes a large fraction of @xmath3 .",
    "lowering the baryon fraction would go in the direction of allowing lower @xmath3 , but here the effect is quite small because our acceptable models already have a low ratio of @xmath168 .",
    "our adopted dmr normalizations , based on the two - year data , tend to be higher ( by roughly 10% or + 1-@xmath48 ) than the central values estimated from the 4-year data ( see discussion in section 2.1 ) .",
    "lowering the normalizations would reduce the value of @xmath10 for a given @xmath3 , so again a higher @xmath3 would be required to match the observed cluster abundance .",
    "generalizations of the simplest inflation models most easily lead to redder primordial power spectra , e.g. , to an effective index @xmath21 in flat models . lowering @xmath42 reduces the @xmath10 inferred from dmr - normalization both because it changes the extrapolation of fluctuation amplitudes to cluster scales and because , at least in power - law inflation models , such tilted spectra are accompanied by the production of gravity waves .",
    "any change towards a redder inflation power spectrum thus raises the lower limit on @xmath3 .",
    "reducing @xmath42 to about 0.8 is a simple way to make @xmath7 compatible with the dmr data and the observed cluster abundance , though any @xmath7 model remains difficult to reconcile with the high baryon fraction in rich clusters and with current observational estimates of @xmath35 and @xmath17 .",
    "while our adopted range of median cluster masses is fairly conservative , we can not exclude the possibility that this estimate may be systematically too low or too high .",
    "the gravitational lensing data suggest that , if anything , the former is more likely . in this case the observed cluster abundance would require a higher value of @xmath10 and hence a higher value of @xmath3 for consistency with the dmr data .",
    "we conclude that , under the assumptions discussed above , @xmath169 is required to produce enough massive galaxy clusters in spatially - flat , dmr - normalized cdm models . in open models ,",
    "the value of @xmath10 implied by the dmr data drops so fast with decreasing @xmath3 that the lower limit rises to @xmath170 .",
    "the statistical significance of these limits is difficult to quantify because the errors are dominated by the systematic uncertainties just discussed .",
    "our conclusions agree well with previous n - body work ( @xcite ) and with semianalytic results based on the press - schechter model ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we are able to set a more stringent lower limit on @xmath3 because the use of large n - body simulations removes any uncertainty regarding the relation between predicted and observed cluster masses .",
    "related constraints on cosmological parameters follow from considering the _ evolution _ of the abundance of clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "current cluster evolution data tentatively indicate @xmath171 , @xmath172 ( carlberg et al . 1997a ; henry 1997 private communication ) , consistent with the constraints derived here for open models .",

    "( ) conclude that open - bubble inflation models with @xmath3 as low as 0.3 could be consistent with current observations .",
    "lower @xmath3 is also allowed if the inflation model produces a bluer , `` anti - tilted '' primordial power spectrum , though in some cases the effect of such a change on the dmr - normalized @xmath10 would be partly cancelled by the contribution of gravity waves to the dmr anisotropies .",
    "open cdm models with @xmath173 ( on scales well below the hubble length ) have been advocated by bunn & white ( ) and white & silk ( ) . in these studies the anti - tilted spectrum is imposed _",
    "ad hoc _ ; it has not yet been shown that such a spectrum can be produced by quantum fluctuations in an open - universe inflation model .    matching the anisotropy amplitude and",
    "the abundance of rich clusters does not , by itself , guarantee a successful cosmological model . of the many criteria available for discriminating amongst cosmological models , the observed pattern of galaxy clustering remains one of the most widely used .",
    "however , whereas the cmb and cluster abundance tests apply directly to the distribution of dark matter , the galaxy clustering test requires a model for the galaxy distribution .",
    "unfortunately , our understanding of galaxy formation is still so primitive that only highly idealized mathematical models such as the `` high peak '' model of biased galaxy formation ( @xcite ) have been explored in detail .",
    "cosmological gasdynamic simulations do not yet have sufficient resolution to follow galaxy formation except in relatively small volumes ( @xcite ) .",
    "our dark matter simulations do not address the issue of galaxy formation , but they do at least provide an accurate description of the statistical properties of the dark matter distribution on scales @xmath174 . comparing this mass distribution with the _ observed _ galaxy distribution reveals the kind of biases that must be present in the galaxy distribution for a particular cosmological model to be acceptable .",
    "we find that all dmr - normalized cdm models that successfully reproduce the cluster abundance require that the galaxy distribution be biased relative to the mass in a non - trivial fashion . except in the @xmath76 ,",
    "@xmath175 case , the acceptable low-@xmath3 models , with or without a cosmological constant , produce mass distributions that are _ significantly more strongly clustered _ than the observed galaxy distribution on small and intermediate scales .",

    "@xmath176 , the mass correlations in these models become comparable to the galaxy correlations . in the @xmath76 ,",
    "@xmath175 case , the predicted mass correlations are only slightly stronger than the observed galaxy correlations on small scales ( and , within the uncertainties , could even be weaker ) , but they fall well below the observed @xmath118 on scales larger than @xmath177 .",
    "this model thus requires ( mild ) antibias on small scales and positive bias on large scales .",
    "finally , the tilted @xmath7 model requires a strong positive bias everywhere , and the degree of bias depends on scale . beyond @xmath177 , it must rise steeply with scale to compensate for the rapidly declining large - scale clustering strength .",
    "little is known about the physical plausibility of a strong antibias in the galaxy distribution on small and intermediate scales , which would be required for almost all our low-@xmath3 models to match observations .",
    "galaxy mergers might produce this kind of effect , and preliminary results from a large programme of cosmological gasdynamic simulations suggest that galaxies may indeed be antibiased in low @xmath3 models , although at a lower level than seems required by observations ( @xcite ) , except possibly for @xmath178 open models . on empirical grounds , however , an antibiased galaxy distribution in models with @xmath179 seems difficult to reconcile with virial analyses of galaxy clusters . if the mass - to - light ratio of clusters equals the universal value , then these imply that @xmath180 , with a 2-@xmath48 upper limit @xmath181 ( carlberg , yee & ellingson ; carlberg ) . however , if galaxies are over - represented in clusters by a factor @xmath182 , then the data imply @xmath183 .",
    "if galaxies were antibiased on small scales , then we would expect them to be under - represented in clusters , implying @xmath184 , and therefore @xmath185 ( or @xmath186 at 2-@xmath48 ) .    given these considerations ,",
    "our results lend support to earlier suggestions ( @xcite ) that low - density , flat - universe cdm models can more easily fit the observations if they have a mildly tilted primordial mass power spectrum .",
    "flat-@xmath14 models with @xmath187 could still have reasonable values of @xmath3 and @xmath35 for a given @xmath31 , and they would require less small - scale antibiasing in the galaxy distribution .",
    "it is possible but less clear that open cdm models would benefit from an anti - tilted primordial spectrum , for although this would allow a lower @xmath3 and higher @xmath35 for a given @xmath31 , it would also lead to stronger small - scale mass clustering and hence a requirement of substantial antibias in the galaxy distribution on these scales .",
    "a bluer primordial power spectrum could also bring the small - scale ( multipole @xmath188 ) cmb anisotropies in open models into conflict with upper limits ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and it might result in a steeper cmb anisotropy spectrum on intermediate scales ( @xmath189 ) than is indicated by current data ( @xcite ) .",
    "both of these effects , however , could be ameliorated by mild early reionization .    to illustrate the region of parameter space allowed by current observational uncertainties , consider an @xmath190 , open - bubble inflation model with @xmath191gyr ( as advocated by @xcite ) and @xmath192 ( as advocated by @xcite , b ) .",

    "agreement at this level could probably also be achieved by a tilted , flat-@xmath14 cdm model ( @xcite ) .    a great variety of observations currently underway or planned for the near future will significantly sharpen the constraints that we have discussed in this paper .",

    "<S> we also compute the topology of isodensity contours in these models , obtaining theoretical predictions that are less sensitive to the details of galaxy formation .    </S>",
    "<S> cosmology : theory , large - scale structure of universe , galaxies : clusters : general </S>"
