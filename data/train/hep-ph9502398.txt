    "the light quark current masses @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are among the fundamental parameters in the standard model of particle interactions , but an accurate and reliable determination of these parameters remains elusive .",
    "the reason is that these masses are small compared to the mass scale associated with confinement , @xmath5 , so that the light quarks are tightly bound inside hadrons and their mass can not be measured directly .",
    "however , we can expand around the chiral limit @xmath6 to obtain information about current mass _ ratios _ using chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the idea is that in the chiral limit , there is a @xmath7 chiral symmetry that is spontaneously broken to @xmath8 at the scale @xmath9 . in this limit",
    ", the theory contains 8 nambu ",
    "goldstone bosons , which are identified with the light pseudoscalar meson octet ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the low - energy interactions of these states can be parameterized by an effective lagrangian with a few unknown parameters @xcite .",
    "in addition , the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the light quark masses and by electromagnetism .",
    "this breaking can be treated perturbatively in the quark masses and the electromagnetic coupling , and selection rules associated with the chiral symmetry again tightly constrain the form of these perturbations .    the main difficulty in this approach",
    "is that @xmath13@xmath14 , so that higher - order effects can significantly change low - order results .",
    "this is the source of the interesting ( and controversial ) issue of whether higher - order corrections can be large enough to allow @xmath15 @xcite , thus solving the the strong @xmath16 problem .",
    "this will be a large part of the focus of this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the methods of heavy quark symmetry @xcite and heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory @xcite to the determination of the light quark masses from the mass spectrum of mesons containing a single heavy quark .",
    "these states have quantum numbers @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "if we could ignore electromagnetic effects and higher - order corrections in the quark masses , we would obtain [ naive ] r where @xmath20 , _",
    "etc_. ( we use the names of the heavy - meson states to denote their masses . ) the enormous discrepancies between these numbers clearly can not be accounted for by the higher - order quark mass corrections .",
    "the reason for these discrepancies is simply that the electromagnetic contribution to @xmath21 is numerically comparable to the contribution from the light quark masses .",
    "this underlines the importance of determining the electromagnetic contribution to the mass differences",
    ".    we will carry out an improved analysis of @xmath22 making use of the heavy - meson s computed in ref .",
    "( for earlier related work , see ref .",
    "our analysis will also include important non - analytic corrections in the quark masses @xcite and will pay careful attention to the role of higher - order corrections in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we will briefly describe the elements of the calculation of the s in the next section .",
    "the following section contains our analysis of @xmath22 , and the final section gives our conclusions .",
    "@xcite , we computed the electromagnetic mass differences of heavy mesons in terms of measurable data using techniques similar to those used in the classic calculation of the  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea in both calculations is to use dispersion - theoretic arguments together with the ultraviolet properties of qcd to relate the  to measured strong - interaction matrix elements .",
    "we review the main features of our calculation here in order to make this paper more self - contained .",
    "we begin by writing ( p_d - p_u)^(em ) = where @xmath23 is a difference of the ( traced ) compton amplitudes t_q(p , k ) i d^4x",
    "e^ikx j^(0 ) j_(x ) , where @xmath24 is the electromagnetic current .",
    "it can be shown rigorously that this integral converges @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath25 in the large-@xmath26 limit , where @xmath26 is the number of qcd colors . in this limit",
    ", we can express @xmath25 as a sum of tree graphs in a theory of ( infinitely many ) mesons with interactions that are at most polynomial in momenta @xcite .",
    "( this can be viewed as a rigorous version of the `` resonance dominance '' assumption made in refs .",
    "@xcite . ) the vertices of the meson graphs that determine @xmath25 are directly related to physical processes .",
    "for example , the graphs in fig .",
    "1b determine the heavy - meson form factors , while the last two graphs in fig .",
    "1a are related to meson scattering amplitudes .",
    "thus , the representation of @xmath25 in the meson theory can be viewed as a double dispersion relation in @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we then impose constraints on the couplings appearing in this sum by demanding that the matrix elements have the infrared behavior required by electromagnetic gauge invariance , and the ultraviolet behavior demanded by qcd .",
    "these constraints can be expressed as sum rules relating the couplings appearing in the sum .",
    "( two of these sum rules are close analogs of the weinberg sum rules that appear in the calculation of the @xcite . )    even after imposing the sum rules , the  is given by an infinite ( convergent ) sum over intermediate states .",
    "we then derive an unsubtracted fixed-@xmath29 dispersion relation for @xmath25 that shows that the contributions of intermediate states with large mass are suppressed by inverse powers of their mass .",
    "it is therefore sensible to assume that the sum is dominated by the lowest - lying intermediate states .",
    "that is , we keep the minimum number of intermediate states to saturate the known asymptotic behavior of the form factors and other matrix elements that appear .",
    "this turns out to be the @xmath30 and @xmath31 heavy - meson states ( which are degenerate in the limit @xmath32 ) and the vector mesons @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 that are responsible for `` softening '' the form factors .",
    "when the sum rules are imposed on this restricted set of intermediate states , there are sufficiently few free parameters that we are able to obtain numerical estimates for the s. the results are ( b^+ - b^0)^(em ) + o(1/m_b^2 ) , ^(em ) & & + & & + o(1/m_c^2 ) , ^(em ) & & + & & + o(1/m_c^2 ) . here",

    "differs by a sign from that of ref .  @xcite . ] since the isospin splittings in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 systems are equal in the heavy - quark limit , we can not use them to get independent constraints on the quark masses . for the @xmath44 system",
    ", we have chosen to work in terms of the `` spin - independent '' combination @xmath45 @xcite , for which the the largest @xmath37-dependent term in the  cancels .",
    "we will use the @xmath44 hyperfine splitting @xmath46 to give a determination of @xmath37 below .",
    "there are a number of simultaneous approximations made in this computation : the heavy - quark expansion ( including @xmath47 terms ) , the large-@xmath26 limit , and the truncation of intermediate states .",
    "the heavy - quark expansion appears to be under good control in our calculation , in the sense that the @xmath47 corrections are small compared to the leading terms .",
    "the large-@xmath26 limit and truncation of intermediate states are equivalent to approximations that can be made in the computation of the , which then works to @xmath14 .",
    "we conclude that it is reasonable to expect our estimates of the s to be accurate to about @xmath14 .",
    "we now complete our determination of the s by extracting a value for @xmath37 from the @xmath44 hyperfine splittings .",
    "to order @xmath48 in chiral perturbation theory , one finds @xcite ( d^*+ - d^*0 ) - ( d^+ - d^0 ) & = & [ ( d^*+ - d^*0 ) - ( d^+ - d^0)]^(em ) + & & + [ ( d^*_s - d^ * ) - ( d_s - d ) ] .",

    "( [ idiff],[sdiff ] ) arise from analytic counterterms in the effective lagrangian of order @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath75 are the chiral logs that renormalize them .",
    "the counterterms and the chiral logs each depend on a renormalization scale @xmath76 in such a way that the terms proportional to @xmath77 are independent of @xmath76 .",
    "the fact that the chiral logs are proportional to the same function of quark masses as the corresponding counterterms is a consequence of the simple structure of the @xmath0 group theory for this system .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the chiral logs in @xmath78 can not be computed in terms of known quantities .",
    "the reason is the presence of higher - order terms in the effective heavy - meson lagrangian such as ( in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) l = , that are not constrained by present data .",
    "these terms give rise to non - analytic contributions such as _ 3 m_s^2 ~ = o(m_s^2 m_s ) .",
    "( a similar fact was noted for baryons in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in principle , the log corrections are enhanced over the counterterm contributions by @xmath79 for @xmath80 , but in practice the logs are not significantly larger than unity .",

    "since such relations are expected to work to @xmath85@xmath14 , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath86 should not be much larger than @xmath14 . ref .",
    "@xcite advocates a different measure of the chiral corrections .",
    "they demand that the second - order corrections to individual masses be less than @xmath14 , but allow this to be the result of cancellations between larger corrections . following this criterion ,",
    "we would allow @xmath86 to be @xmath87 , since this can cancel against @xmath88 corrections arising from the term proportional to @xmath89 to give @xmath14 corrections to @xmath30 mass differences .",
