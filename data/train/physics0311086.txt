    "the lagrangian averaged euler ( lae-@xmath0 ) equations for average incompressible ideal fluid motion first appeared in the context of averaged fluid models in @xcite .",
    "dissipation was added later to produce the lagrangian averaged navier - stokes ( lans-@xmath0 ) equations , also known as the navier - stokes-@xmath0 equations - dimensional version of the ch equations , also known as the epdiff equations , arise via euler - poincar reduction of @xmath4 geodesics on the group of all diffeomorphisms , and _ not _ the volume preserving ones ( see @xcite ) . ] .    remarkably , the lae-@xmath0 equations are mathematically identical to the inviscid second grade fluid equations introduced in @xcite , except for the fact that the parameter @xmath0 is interpreted differently in the two theories . in the case of lae-@xmath0 and lans-@xmath0 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is a spatial scale below which rapid fluctuations are smoothed by linear and nonlinear dispersion .    as in , for example",
    ", the work of @xcite on nonlinear waves , the distinctive feature of the lagrangian averaging approach is that averaging is carried out at the level of the variational principle and not at the level of the euler or navier - stokes equations , which is the traditional averaging or filtering approach used for both the reynolds averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) and the large eddy simulation ( les ) models . as such",
    ", the variational procedure does not add any _ artificial _ viscosity , a physical reason to consider the lae-@xmath0 or lans-@xmath0 equations as good models for incompressible turbulent flow .",
    "moreover , it has been proven that the @xmath0 models are computationally very attractive ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although sharing the same general technique ( use of averaging and asymptotic methods in the variational formulation ) , several alternative derivations of incompressible lae-@xmath0 equations exist in the literature .",
    "one of these derivations ( see @xcite ) uses the generalized lagrangian mean ( glm ) theory developed in @xcite .",
    "an alternative derivation of the incompressible lae-@xmath0 and lans-@xmath0 equations was given in @xcite by using an ensemble average over the set of solutions of the euler equations with initial data in a phase - space ball of radius @xmath0 , while treating the dissipative term via stochastic variations .",
    "the derivation also uses a turbulence closure that is based on the lagrangian fluctuations , namely a generalization of the frozen turbulence hypothesis of taylor ( see @xcite ) .    rigorous analysis aimed at proving global well - posedness and regularity of the three - dimensional isotropic and anisotropic lans-@xmath0 equations",
    "can be found in , for example , @xcite .",
    "however , global existence for the inviscid three - dimensional lagrangian averaged euler ( lae-@xmath0 ) remains an open problem .    from a computational viewpoint , numerical simulations of the @xmath0 models ( see @xcite ) show that the lans-@xmath0 equations give comparable computational savings as les models for forced and decaying turbulent flows in periodic domains . for wall - bounded flows , it is expected that either the anisotropic model or a model with varying @xmath0 needs to be used ; the computational efficacy of these methods on such flows remains to be demonstrated .",
    "as far as the compressible case is concerned , the only reference we know of is @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss the relation between the work in this reference and the present paper below .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a more detailed history of the pde analysis for lae-@xmath0 and lans-@xmath0 equations and to @xcite for a survey and further references about the numerical aspects of these models .",
    "[ [ motivation ] ] motivation + + + + + + + + + +    in compressible flows there are two major problems at higher wave numbers , or small scales , that require special attention . these are ( a ) turbulence for high reynolds number flows ( common with incompressible flows ) and ( b ) strong shocks . in both cases",
    "the challenge lies in the appropriate representation of small scale effects . for turbulence",
    ", the energy cascade to smaller scales can be balanced by viscous dissipation , resulting in the viscous regularization of the euler equations .",
    "historically , viscous dissipation has been used to regularize shock discontinuities .",
    "this includes adding to the euler equation _ non - physical and artificial viscous terms _ and fourier s law for heat transfer in the shock region ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this way , the steepening effect of the nonlinear convective term is balanced by dissipation .",
    "we believe that lagrangian averaging is a reasonable alternative way to regularize shock waves .",
    "the net effect of lagrangian averaging is to add dispersion instead of dissipation to the euler equations ; that is , one adds terms that redistribute energy in a nonlinear fashion . in other , rather different situations ,",
    "the technique of balancing a nonlinear convective term by dispersive mechanisms was used by @xcite for the kdv equation and by @xcite for plasma flows .",
    "the competition between nonlinearity and dispersion has of course resulted in remarkable discoveries , the most famous being solitons , localized waves that collide elastically , suffering only a shift in phase .",
    "the robustness of solitons in overcoming strong perturbations is largely due to a balance between nonlinearity and linear dispersion .",
    "note that in lagrangian averaging , the energy redistribution mechanism that is introduced is nonlinear and might yield other interesting features that warrant further investigation .",
    "another feature of the compressible lagrangian averaged navier - stokes-@xmath0 equations ( or clans-@xmath0 equations ) is that in turbulent flows with shocks , the effect of shocks and turbulence are simultaneously modeled by the same technique , namely the lagrangian averaging method .",
    "[ [ issues - addressed - in - this - paper ] ] issues addressed in this paper + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper we apply the averaged lagrangian methodology to derive the isotropic and anisotropic averaged models for compressible euler equations .",
    "one goal of this paper is to present a clear derivation of the averaged equations .",
    "we are particularly interested in separating the two issues of averaging and modeling . in the derivation",
    ", a new ensemble averaging technique is proposed and investigated .",
    "instead of taking clouds of initial conditions , as in @xcite , we average over a tube of trajectories @xmath5 centered around a given lagrangian flow @xmath2 . the tube is constructed by specifying the lagrangian fluctuations @xmath6 at @xmath7 and providing a _ flow rule _ which evolves them to all later times .",
    "the choice of flow rule is a precise modeling assumption which brings about closure of the system .",
    "for the incompressible case we assume that fluctuations are lie advected by the mean flow ( or frozen into the mean flow as divergence - free vector fields ) , and we obtain both the isotropic and the anisotropic versions of the lae-@xmath0 equations .",
    "the advection hypothesis is the natural extension to vector fields of the classical frozen turbulence hypothesis of g.i .",
    "taylor ( see @xcite ) stated for scalar fluctuations .",
    "the second goal of this work is to extend the derivation to barotropic compressible flows .",
    "this problem has already been considered by holm ( see @xcite ) in the context of generalized lagrangian mean ( glm ) motion . in this work",
    ", an alpha model appears as a glm fluid theory with an appropriate taylor hypothesis closure .",
    "however , even though @xcite enumerates several frozen - in closure hypotheses , the averaged equations are derived only for the case when the fluctuations are parallel transported by the mean flow . in our work",
    "we will consider a more general advection hypothesis to study the compressible anisotropic case .",
    "in addition , a physically based new flow rule is introduced to deal with the isotropic case .",
    "the averaging technique consists of expanding the original lagrangian with respect to a perturbation parameter @xmath8 , truncating the expansion to @xmath9 terms , and then taking the average .",
    "it turns out that the averaged compressible lagrangian depends on the lagrangian fluctuations @xmath10 only through three tensor quantities which are quadratic in @xmath10 . in the terminology of @xcite",
    "these tensors represent the second - order statistics of the lagrangian fluctuations .",
    "evolution equations for these tensors are derived from a core modeling assumption : a prescribed _ flow rule _ for the time - evolution of the fluctuations @xmath10 .",
    "the flow rule gives us closure , allowing us to apply hamilton s principle to the averaged lagrangian and thereby derive an equation for the mean velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in  [ averaging - general ] we describe a general procedure for lagrangian ensemble averaging .",
    "this procedure is then applied to the action for incompressible fluids in  [ averaging - incomp ] to demonstrate our derivation technique .",
    "the general procedure is applied again in  [ averaging - euler ] , this time to the more complex case of barotropic compressible fluids .  [ flow - rules ]",
    "is devoted to modeling issues ; here the strategy of modeling the evolution of lagrangian fluctuations @xmath10 using flow rules is discussed in detail . in  [ averaged - pdes ]",
    "we derive the averaged equations for incompressible and compressible models in both isotropic and anisotropic versions .",
