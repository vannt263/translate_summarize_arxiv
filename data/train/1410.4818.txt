    "in the chiral ( massless quark ) limit , the theory of the strong interaction quantum chromodynamics ( qcd) has a single fundamental parameter : its coupling @xmath0 which decreases logarithmically with increasing energy scale q , i.e. @xmath7 , starting from a value @xmath80.2  gev where the perturbatively - defined coupling diverges .",
    "the running coupling @xmath0 enters in the perturbative expansion of theoretical cross section for any hard process involving quarks and gluons , and the uncertainty in its value is a key ( sometimes dominant ) component of the theoretical error in all perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions for any collision process involving hadrons .",
    "many precision fits of the standard model as well as searches for new physics depend on @xmath0 , whose value needs , thus , to be determined with good accuracy and precision . +",
    "the determination of @xmath0 relies on the comparison of theoretical predictions for various observables , obtained perturbatively at a given level of accuracy ( next - to - next - to - leading order , nnlo , in most cases ) , with the corresponding experimental measurements .",
    "the extracted @xmath0 values at different energy scales are then compared to each other by translating the result in terms of the value at the z mass pole : @xmath4 .",
    "the current value of @xmath4  =  0.1185@xmath50.0006 , has been obtained from a combination of measurements at @xmath2 , deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) e,@xmath9-p , and hadron - hadron colliders  @xcite :    \\(i ) hadronic @xmath10 decays ( n@xmath11lo ) , ( ii ) hadronic w , z decays ( n@xmath11lo ) , ( iii ) radiative heavy - quarkonia decays ( nlo ) , and ( iv ) event shapes and jet rates ( nnlo ) , in @xmath2 collisions ;    \\(v ) scaling violations in parton distribution functions ( nnlo ) , and jet cross sections ( nlo ) , in e,@xmath9-p dis ;    \\(vi ) jet cross sections and angular correlations ( nlo ) , and top - quark cross sections ( nnlo ) , in p - p , p-@xmath12  collisions .",
    "in addition , comparisons of the predictions for different short - distance observables computed through lattice and pqcd methods provide extra `` data points '' for the determination of the @xmath4 world - average , although the low systematic uncertainty assigned to such an approach has been questioned  @xcite .",
    "the current @xmath0 uncertainty is of order @xmath50.5% , although a more conservative estimate sets it at the @xmath51% level  @xcite , making of @xmath0 the least precisely known of all fundamental couplings in nature . in this context , having at hand extra independent approaches to determine @xmath0 with experimental and theoretical uncertainties different than those of the methods currently used would be an obvious asset .",
    "+ attempts were carried out in the past ( see e.g.  @xcite ) to try to measure @xmath13 ( or , equivalently , @xmath0 ) using parton - to - hadron fragmentation functions ( ffs ) in the region of low fractional momenta @xmath14 via the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla )  @xcite which resums the soft and collinear singularities present in this region of phase - space . however , these older calculations were limited to lo approximations with a number of simplifying assumptions : ( i ) ad hoc cuts in the experimental distributions , ( ii ) simple fits in a restricted ff range , ( iii ) number of quark - flavours fixed to @xmath15  =  3 , and ( iv ) use of only one or two ff moments ( gaussian approximation ) . as a result ,",
    "very imprecise ( or even inconsistent ) values of @xmath16  80600  mev were obtained . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have presented a novel extraction of @xmath0 from the energy evolution of the first four moments of the parton - to - hadron ffs including , for the first time , resummations of higher - order ( nnll or nmlla ) logarithms and nlo running - coupling corrections .",
    "the approach has been successfully tested with the world experimental jet data from @xmath2 annihilation  @xcite and deep - inelastic @xmath3p collisions  @xcite .",
    "we provide here a more detailed assessment of the systematic uncertainties involved in our @xmath0 extraction .",
    "the parton - to - hadron ff , @xmath17 , encodes the probability that parton @xmath18 fragments into a hadron @xmath19 carrying a fraction @xmath1 of the parent parton s momentum . due to colour coherence and gluon - radiation interference inside a parton shower , not the softest partons but those with intermediate energies ( @xmath20 ) multiply most effectively in qcd cascades , leading to a single - particle spectrum with a typical `` hump - backed plateau '' ( hbp ) shape as a function of @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ffbabar ] ) .",
    "such an hbp shape can be parametrized , without any loss of generality , as a distorted gaussian ( dg ) which depends on the original energy of the parton , @xmath22 , evolved down to a shower cut - off scale @xmath23 : @xmath24}\\ , ,   \\label{eq : dg}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , with moments : @xmath26 ( hadron multiplicity inside the jet ) , @xmath27 ( dg peak position ) , @xmath28 ( dg width ) , @xmath29 ( dg skewness ) , and @xmath30 ( dg kurtosis ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : ffbabar ] shows a typical example of ffs fitted to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dg ] ) with the corresponding extracted moments",
    ". since the measured final - state hadrons are massive and the theoretical calculations assume massless partons / hadrons ( i.e. @xmath31 ) , the expression ( [ eq : dg ] ) for @xmath32 needs to be modified by introducing an effective mass , via @xmath33 , with the corresponding jacobian determinant correction .",
    "such a change of variable only affects the dg fit for the softest hadrons ( i.e. for the highest @xmath32 values )  @xcite .     at @xmath34  10.54  gev  @xcite fitted to the dg eq .",
    "( [ eq : dg ] ) .",
    "the obtained moments are listed for two choices of the effective mass ( @xmath35  =  0,0.2  gev ) . ]",
    "the process of parton radiation and splitting occurring in a jet shower , i.e. the evolution of the ff from a scale q to q before the final parton - to - hadron transition , is governed by the dglap  @xcite equations ( at large @xmath36 , i.e. low @xmath37  2 ) and by mlla approaches ( at small @xmath1 , i.e. large @xmath38  2 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have solved the set of integro - differential equations for the ff evolution including nlo * @xmath0 and next - to - mlla corrections , by expressing the mellin - transformed hadron distribution in terms of the @xmath39 anomalous dimension : @xmath40 $ ] for @xmath41 , resulting in an expansion in half - powers of @xmath0 : @xmath42 , of which two new higher - order terms have been computed for the first time .",

    "evolving the fragmentation functions down to the lowest possible scale , q@xmath45",
    "( i.e. @xmath46 , or `` limiting spectrum '' ) , one obtains expressions for the hbp moments which depend _ only _ on @xmath13 .",
    "such an approach is justified for infrared - safe observables by the `` local parton - hadron duality '' hypothesis which states that the distribution of partons in jets is identical to that of the final hadrons ( up to a constant @xmath47 which only affects the absolute normalization of the hbp distribution ) .",
    "thus , by fitting the experimental hadron jet data at various energies to the dg parametrization ( [ eq : dg ] ) , one can determine @xmath0 from the corresponding energy - dependence of its fitted moments .",
    "figure  [ fig : dgfits ] shows the dg fits of the ffs measured in @xmath2 ( 32 datasets , left plot )  @xcite and dis ( 15 datasets , right plot )  @xcite . we note that the dis ffs need to be scaled up by a factor of 2 since only half of the total hadron production ( in the current hemisphere of the breit frame ) is measured . for increasing jet energies the ff peak shifts to higher @xmath32 , and its width broadens .",
    "the extraction of the ff moments in the dg fit has two possible sources of uncertainty : ( i ) the choice of the @xmath35 factor to account for finite hadron - mass corrections , and ( ii ) the use of experimental ffs with slightly different final charged - hadron definitions ( the different experiments require tracks coming from within 110  cm from the primary interaction vertex , including or not a fraction of secondary hadrons from weak k@xmath48 and @xmath49 decays ) . to estimate both effects",
    "we have taken the recent high - quality prompt and inclusive pion / kaon / proton ffs measured by the babar experiment  @xcite , and fitted their total ( summed ) distribution to dgs with varying values of @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting fitted moments for @xmath35  =  00.2  gev are listed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffbabar ] .",
    "in addition , since some older ff studies extracted the peak position and width of the single - hadron distributions assuming a pure gaussian shape , we list also the extracted values of @xmath50 and @xmath28 in the gaussian approximation in the top - right legend of fig .  [",
    "fig : ffbabar ] .",
    "the main findings are as follows :    \\(i ) the fit uncertainties of all the extracted moments cover well the considered range of @xmath5100.2  gev variations . the best fits ( minimum @xmath52 ) of the experimental ffs to the dg ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dgfits ] ) are obtained for @xmath53=  130@xmath530  mev ( @xmath2 ) and 70@xmath520  mev ( dis ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the dg moments obtained for the prompt and inclusive charged - hadrons ffs are all consistent within their associated uncertainties except , as expected , for the total multiplicity n@xmath54 which is a factor of 810% smaller for the primary - hadrons ffs .",
    "\\(iii ) the obtained ff maximum @xmath50 and width @xmath28 assuming a gaussian distribution around the peak , overestimate their values by 6% and 20% respectively compared to the more realistic dg fits .",
    "the conclusion is that our ff analysis is robust with respect to hadronization corrections , and that only the extracted value of n@xmath54 needs to be reduced by a factor of ( 9@xmath51)% if the experimental distributions have not been corrected for secondary weak decays .",
    "in addition , the ff peaks and widths extracted in gaussian fits in the oldest data analyses overestimate these parameters by 6% and 20% respectively compared to the dg fits .",
    "+            from the parton - to - hadron ff moments obtained for jets of various energies , one can extract @xmath0 by fitting their combined evolutions to our nlo*+nmlla predictions , which include also corrections to account for the increasing number of flavours , @xmath15  =  3,4,5 , at the corresponding heavy - quark production thresholds : e@xmath55  m@xmath56  1.3,4.2  gev .",
    "the energy dependence of the multiplicity , peak , width and skewness of the jet ffs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for @xmath2 annihilation at @xmath57  2200  gev  @xcite ( top panels ) , and for dis @xmath3p and @xmath58p collisions in the range of four - momentum transfers @xmath59  4180  gev  @xcite ( lower panels ) .",
    "we note that the dis plot includes more moments ( published in previous studies ) than those obtained directly fitting the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : dgfits ] , right .",
    "the hadron multiplicities measured in dis jets ( scaled by a factor of two to cover both hemispheres ) are smaller ( especially at high energy ) than those measured in @xmath2 collisions  @xcite , a fact pointing likely to limitations in the ff measurement only in half ( current breit ) @xmath3p hemisphere and/or in the determination of the relevant @xmath60 kinematic variable .",
    "the dis hbp widths show also larger scatter than observed in @xmath2 , which is not unexpected as we are including moments fitted in the gaussian approximation which overestimates their value by about 20% as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the skewness has the largest uncertainties of all moments , and the kurtosis ( not shown ) is very close to zero and not properly reproduced by the calculations  @xcite .",
    "the most robust ff moment for the determination of @xmath13 is the peak position @xmath61 which has the simplest theoretical expression for its nlo*+nmlla energy evolution  @xcite , and it is largely insensitive to the uncertainties ( finite - mass corrections , secondary decays , dg fit ) associated with our method .",
    "+ the fits of the energy - dependencies of the hbp moments allow one to extract qcd coupling values : @xmath4  =  0.1195  @xmath5  0.0022 ( from the @xmath2 data )  @xcite , and @xmath4  =  0.119  @xmath5  0.010 ( from dis jets alone )  @xcite , in perfect agreement with the current world average .",
    "the quoted propagated @xmath4 uncertainties have been obtained following the `` @xmath52 averaging '' method  @xcite .",
    "namely , we fit first the energy - dependence for each individual moment to its corresponding theoretical prediction and if the goodness - of - fit @xmath52 is larger than the number of degrees of freedom ( ndof ) , all the data - points of the moment are enlarged by a common factor such that @xmath52/ndof equals unity .",
    "we then perform the combined fit of _ all _ the energy - evolutions of the four moments letting @xmath13 as the _ single _ free parameter .",
    "such an approach takes into account in a well defined manner any correlations among the four extractions of @xmath0 , as well as any missing extra systematic uncertainties .",
    "our discussion of the experimental uncertainties indicates that such an error assignment covers perfectly well the range of @xmath0 variations induced by finite hadron - mass corrections , experimental final - hadron definitions , and dg fits .",
    "the advantages of our @xmath0 determination compared to all other methods used so far are two - fold :    \\(i ) our approach relies on a theoretically convergent resummation of soft and collinear logs down to q@xmath45 and , thus , it is much more robust with respect to corrections due to the transition from partons to hadrons .",
    "hadronization uncertainties are ( much ) smaller and limited to the choice of the @xmath35 factor accounting for finite - hadron mass effects as discussed in the previous section .",
    "\\(ii ) our expansion in half - powers of @xmath0 includes almost the full set of @xmath0 nlo corrections plus nnll terms .",
    "the latter log corrections partially account for contributions from missing ( nnlo ) terms and , in this sense , our approach is more complete than existing @xmath0 extractions at nlo accuracy .",
    "collisions at @xmath57  10200  gev , fitted to the nlo*+nmlla predictions evaluated at a scale @xmath44  =  1.4 ( i.e. q@xmath62  1  gev ) . ]    notwithstanding this last item , the state - of - the - art @xmath0 determinations are at nnlo accuracy  @xcite whereas our method is nlo*+nnll . in order to estimate the size of theoretical uncertainties associated with missing fixed - order terms in our truncation of the @xmath0 expansion",
    ", we have redone the fit of the moments versus jet energy for a different value of the scale @xmath23 at which the parton evolution is stopped .",
    "we vary @xmath44 from the default limiting - spectrum value ( @xmath44  =  0 , i.e. q@xmath63 ) to @xmath44  =  1.4 ( i.e. q@xmath62  1  gev ) and fit the experimental data for jets energies in the range q  =  10200  gev , so as to leave some room for parton qcd evolution , i.e. avoiding jet data with energies too close to the shower cutoff at 1  gev .",
    "in the relevant range of experimental jet energies @xmath64  2,10200  gev , the average scale at which @xmath0 is effectively evaluated in our approach is given by the geometric mean : q  =  @xmath65  0.62  gev ( for the limiting spectrum ) and q  =  314  gev ( for the @xmath44  =  1.4 case ) .",

    "[ fig:4 ] .",

    "we assign this difference as a ( positive ) source of systematic error associated with the scale uncertainty of our calculations .",

    "we have studied in detail the experimental and systematic uncertainties associated with our @xmath0 extraction , finding that the fit uncertainties obtained through the `` @xmath52 averaging '' method fully cover the range of @xmath4 variations driven by hadronization ( finite hadron - mass ) corrections , different experimental final - hadron definitions , as well as overall fit procedure .",
    "an additional theoretical - scale uncertainty of + 0.0015 has been calculated by redoing the fit of the moments using a different shower cut - off value ( i.e. relaxing the limiting - spectrum criterion ) .",
