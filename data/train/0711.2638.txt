    "the mechanical response at a point @xmath0 of a simple ( first - grade ) local elastic body @xmath1 depends on the first derivative @xmath2 at @xmath3 of the deformation . in other words",
    ", @xmath1 obeys a constitutive law of the form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 measures the strain energy per unit volume .",
    "the linear map @xmath6 is called the deformation gradient at @xmath0 . of course",
    ", there are materials for which the constitutive equation implies higher order derivatives or even internal variables as it happens with the so - called cosserat media or , more generally , media with microstructure , but such materials will not be considered here .",
    "an important problem in continuum mechanics is to decide if the body is made of the same material at all its points . to handle this question in a proper mathematical way",
    ", one introduces the concept of material isomorphism , that is , a linear isomorphism @xmath7 such that @xmath8 for all deformation gradients @xmath2 at @xmath9 .",
    "intuitively , this means that we can extract a small piece of material around @xmath0 and implant it into @xmath9 without any change in the mechanical response at @xmath9 .",
    "if such is the case for all pairs of body points , we say that the body @xmath1 is uniform .",
    "this has been the starting point of the work by noll and wang @xcite in their approach to uniformity and homogeneity .    in this context",
    ", a material symmetry at @xmath0 is nothing but a material automorphism of the tangent space @xmath10 . the collection of all the material symmetries at @xmath0 forms a group , the material symmetry group @xmath11 at @xmath0 .",
    "an important consequence of the uniformity property is that the material symmetry groups at two different points @xmath0 and @xmath9 are conjugate .",
    "a natural question arises : is there a more general notion that permits to compare the material responses at two arbitrary points even if the body does not enjoy uniformity ?",
    "an answer to this question is based on the comparison of the symmetry groups at different points .",
    "indeed , we say that the body @xmath1 is unisymmetric if the material symmetry groups at two different points are conjugate , whether or not the points are materially isomorphic . from the point of view of applications",
    ", this kind of body corresponds to certain types of the so - called functionally graded materials ( fgm for short ) .",
    "the unisymmetry property was introduced in @xcite with the objective to extend the notion of homogeneity to non - uniform material bodies .",
    "let us recall that the homogeneity of a uniform body is equivalent to the integrability of the associated material @xmath12-structure @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , this material @xmath12-structure is obtained by attaching to each point of @xmath1 the corresponding material symmetry group via the choice of a given linear reference at a fixed point ; a change of the linear reference gives a conjugate @xmath12-structure . in a more sophisticated framework",
    ", the set of all material isomorphisms defines a lie groupoid , which in some sense is a way to deal with all these conjugate @xmath12-structures at the same time .    in the case of unisymmetric materials",
    "the attached group is not the material symmetry group , but its normalizer within the whole general linear group .",
    "this implies a more difficult understanding of the generalized concept of homogeneity associated with unisymmetric materials .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to provide a convenient characterization of this homogeneity property . in this sense",
    ", this work may be regarded as a continuation and improvement of the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec.groupoids ] is devoted to a brief introduction to groupoids and lie groupoids ; in particular , we define the normalizoid of a subgroupoid within a groupoid , which is just the generalization of the notion of normalizer in the context of groups .",
    "an important family of examples is provided by the frame - groupoid , consisting of all the linear isomorphisms between the tangent spaces at all the points of a manifold @xmath13 ; if @xmath13 is equipped with a riemannian metric @xmath14 , one can introduce the notion of orthonormal groupoid ( taking the orthogonal part of the linear isomorphisms given by the polar decomposition ) . if , without necessarily possessing a distinguished riemannian metric , @xmath13 is endowed with a volume form , one obtains the lie subgroupoid of unimodular isomorphisms . in section  [ sec.gstructures ] we analyze the relations between lie groupoids and principal bundles ; in particular , we examine the relation between the frame groupoid and @xmath12-structures on a manifold @xmath13 . in section  [ sec.constitutive.equation ] we study the concepts of material symmetry and material symmetry groups , and in section ",

    "finally , note that any @xmath12-structure related to @xmath318 will have a transversely isotropic structural group as mentioned before .",
    "+ finally , note that we recover an analogue result to theorem [ th.homogeneous.constitutive.equation.coordinates ] , which is also true for fully isotropic fgm solids .",
    "if @xmath1 is homosymmetrically relaxable , then for a unisymmetric and relaxable configuration @xmath236 , the constitutive equation will be invariant under the action of the structure group of the reduced @xmath314-stucture , related to the configuration @xmath236 . in this case , the structure group will coincide through @xmath236 with the symmetry group @xmath246 at any point @xmath0 in the domain of @xmath236 .",
    "however , the constitutive equation will not be independent of the point .      in the same way we have generalized the definition of elastic solids in section ",
    "[ sec.functionally.graded.elastic.solids ] , we are going to give a new definition of elastic fluids .",
    "classically , an elastic fluid is a uniform elastic material which posses a unimodular material structure , that is a @xmath251-structure ( see @xcite for instance ) , even though there are smaller fluid structures as the ones of fluid crystals ( _ cf._@xcite ) .",
    "[ def.functionally.graded.elastic.fluids ] we will say that a functionally graded elastic material @xmath1 is a _ functionally graded fluid _ ( or a _ functionally graded fluid crystal _ ) if there is a volume form @xmath86 on @xmath1 invariant under material symmetries such that every point is fluid ( or , respectivelly , if every point is a fluid crystal ) .",
    "the volume form is called a _ material form_.    as in the case of functionally graded elastic solids , the following two conditions on cross - sections @xmath199 of the frame bundle @xmath316 , @xmath329 characterize the fluid material structure .",
    "given a functionally graded elastic fluid @xmath1 , consider the unimodular groupoid @xmath307 related to the volume form @xmath86 ( example [ eg.unimodular.groupoid ] ) .",
    "when two fluid points have conjugate symmetry groups , only the unimodular part of the conjugate transformation plays a role in the conjugation .",
    "that is , if @xmath131 is the transformation that conjugates these two groups , then the unimodular transformation @xmath330 still realizes the conjugation .",
    "[ th.deleon.epstein.fluids ] if @xmath1 is a unisymmetric elastic fluid , then @xmath331 where @xmath332 is the unimodular reduction of the fgm material groupoid .",
    "let @xmath1 a fluid crystal of first kind ( see @xcite ) , that is , an elastic fluid as in [ def.functionally.graded.elastic.fluids ] such that , for each material point @xmath3 , the symmetry group @xmath11 may be represented for some reference @xmath175 at @xmath0 by matrices of the form @xmath333 with @xmath334 .",
    "the normalizer in @xmath335 of this group of matrices is the set of matrices of the same form but with the restriction @xmath336 .",
    "therefore , when we intersect the normalizer with @xmath251 we obtain the original group of matrices .",
    "this means that @xmath337 for every material point @xmath338 .",
    "the latter example shows us how a fluid material , which is not necessarilly uniform , preserves uniformly the symmetry group structure across the body .",
