    "our current description of the basic interactions in nature , based on the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and general relativity , is in spectacular agreement with all known experiments .",
    "however , it is almost certainly fundamentally incomplete .",
    "the extreme fine - tuning needed to keep the higgs mass small compared to the planck scale ( i.e. , the hierarchy problem ) has motivated many extension of the minimal sm .",
    "all of these contain new physics , beyond the sm , which might be tested at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the most widely explored of these new physics is supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "recently , a new quantum field theory of gravity with  dynamical critical exponent \" @xmath1 equal to 3 in the uv was introduced in @xcite .",
    "such a theory is power - counting renormalizable @xcite in the 3 + 1 spacetime and can be quantized using stochastic quantization method @xcite . besides , it exhibits scaling properties which are anisotropic between space and time @xmath2 measuring dimensions of operators in the unit of spatial momentum , we get @xmath3=-1 $ ] and @xmath4=-z$ ] . this system does nt process the lorentz invariance for nontrivial exponent @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) but processes spatial rotational and translational invariance .",
    "the prototype of such a quantum field theory with @xmath6 is the theory of a lifshitz scalar in d+1 dimensions , first proposed as a description of tricritical phenomena .",
    "the action of the lifshitz scalar can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the spatial laplacian .",
    "this action describes a free - field fixed point with critical exponent @xmath9 .",
    "such fixed points with anisotropic scale invariance are called lifshitz points .",
    "properties of lifshitz type field theory have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the construction of gauge theories with lifshitz fixed points in d+1 dimensions have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "such a theory flows naturally to the relativistic value @xmath10 at long distance , and therefore the lorentz symmetry shall appear as an emergent symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the sm has a lorentz non - invariant uv - completion and realize it at a lifshitz fixed point with critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "a similar extension of the sm in lorentz violating approach is discussed in @xcite .",
    "we focus on the one - loop radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "our results show that the hierarchy problem can be weakened in such a theory .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we will construct the sm at the lifshitz fixed point . in section iii , we will calculate the one - loop radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "in this section we construct the sm at the lifshitz fixed point and derive propagators for scalar , vector and spinor fields , which will be used for the loop calculation in the next section .",
    "we first write down the interactions for the spinor and higgs fields , with dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 , which can be written as @xmath11 ^ 2   - { 1 \\over 2}{\\mu^2 } ( h^\\dagger h ) - { 1 \\over 4}\\lambda ( h^\\dagger h)^2 \\right\\ } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 represents the @xmath13 doublet or singlet , @xmath14 is the gamma matrix and @xmath15 is the covariant derivative .",

    "an extra scalar field has been proposed in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we simply assume that yukawa interactions are responsible for the origin of fermion masses after electroweak symmetry spontaneously broken .",
    "now we switch to constructing the yang - mills theory with arbitrary dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we take @xmath22 , @xmath23 as the time and spatial components of gauge fields , separately",
    ". our theory should be invariant under the following gauge transformation : @xmath24 gauge invariant lagrangian will be constructed from the field strengths , which are constructed from the commutations of covariant derivatives as @xmath25=ig e_i^{}$ ] and @xmath26=ig f_{ij}^{}$ ] .",
    "the lagrangian should contain a kinetic term which is quadratic in first time derivatives .",

    "( 8) by varying @xmath31 : @xmath32 similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we can choose the following natural gauge - fixing condition @xmath33 according to the equation of motion , once we adopt the gauge - fixing condition in eq .",
    "( 10 ) at @xmath34 , this condition will continue to hold for all @xmath35 .",
    "then the propagator for gauge fields can be obtained by using functional method @xmath36 we can also derive the propagators for spinor and higgs fields from eq .",

    "so following terms should be added to the lagrangian : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc .",
    "that is why we use the symbol @xmath42 instead of @xmath43 in eqs .",
    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) . however",
    ", when @xmath44 , where @xmath45 stands for infrared cut off , below which the lorentz symmetry is recovered , these terms will be the subdominant contribution to the propagators . as a result , we can safely use these propagators to preform one - loop calculations at scale @xmath46",
    ". a distinctive feature of the lifshitz type quantum field theory is that the dispersion relation becomes @xmath47 @xcite , where @xmath48 are marginal coupling parameters .",
    "for a long time , there were only two solutions to the hierarchy problem : susy and technicolor , and susy is heavily favored . in recent years , there are several other new ways to address the hierarchy problem , including add models @xcite , little higgs models @xcite , twin higgs models @xcite , folded susy @xcite , lee - wick sm @xcite , and so on . in this section , we will explore a new solution to the hierarchy problem in the lifshitz type quantum field theory .",
