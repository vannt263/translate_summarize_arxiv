    "the progenitors of close binary stars with a white dwarf as primary ( i.e. , more massive ) component are thought to be initially wide detached binaries . in the course of its nuclear evolution , the more massive star expands first .",
    "if the separation is sufficiently small , this will yield a common envelope configuration , where both the remaining core of the more massive star and its lower mass companion revolve around each other within the expelled material from the primary .",
    "responding to the enhanced angular momentum loss due to friction , the separation between the two stars decreases , and when the envelope material is expelled as a planetary nebula , the aforementioned close binary emerges . such systems are known as post common envelope binaries ( pceb ) .",

    "their photometric monitoring for over 10 years revealed small orbital period deviations from a linear ephemeris which they suggest is a result of random variation in the orbital period of the system , possibly caused by activity on the m secondary .",

    "motivated by the amplitude and shape of these variations , we applied a light curve inversion technique @xcite to assess the location of the active region(s ) responsible for the flaring ( in the case of jd3 ) and the origin of surface brightness variations that could be responsible for the deviations of the jd2 , jd5 and jd6 light curves from the model .",

    "we must also keep in mind that the one - dimensional light curves do not provide information on the latitudinal position of spotted region and that , in this case , the entropy regularization algorithm tends to place structures at the center of the projected stellar disk .",

    "an interesting aspect of the morphology of the light curve is seen when comparing the ( o - c ) for the data of jd1 and jd4 to that of the jd2 and jd3 data . despite the incomplete sample of the jd1 and jd4 data",
    ", there is a strong resemblance between the amplitude of the residual of the jd1 and jd3 light curves and jd2 and jd4 light curves , suggesting that the brightness of the relevant active regions changes on timescales of day    the results for jd5 and jd6 are similar to those for jd2 in the overall shape and positioning of the features .",
    "we observe a small ( @xmath46 ) offset of the bright regions in the longitude of the two bright spots ( from phase @xmath47 in 1998 to phase @xmath48 in 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , we notice that the brighter of the two spots is the one centered at phase @xmath49 in jd5 and jd6 whereas for jd2 the brighter spot is the one centered at phase @xmath47 .",
    "since the jd5 and jd6 data sets are not flux calibrated it is not possible to assess the correct flux level of the secondary star , which is essential for the fitting procedure .",

    "jin each individual data set it seems that active regions on this m star are stable and keep their location on time scales of , at least , a few days . \" a comparison of the 1998 and 2000 data , suggests that these active regions may be relatively stable over much longer times , of the order of years .",
    "two - spots configurations , 0.5 phases apart are commonly present on single dm active stars , however their location on the surface of the star evolves with time @xcite .",

    "notwithstanding , h@xmath55 shows the same configuration as h@xmath50 while only one extra feature is detectable on h@xmath56 .",

    "only the secondary star contributes to the observed spectrum as the wd is eclipsed .",

    "in addition to the selection of a correct template to correlate with the m star spectra , we have noticed that the choice of the spectral window has a strong impact in the resulting measured values . specially , the selection of narrow spectral windows results in systematically lower values for the estimated k@xmath31 , while broader ranges results in larger values .",

    "it is very likely that , at the second night of our observations , we observed a flare on the m star , with maximum strength at inferior conjunction of the star .",

    "the low temperature of the wd , compared to cvs of the same orbital period @xcite , and lack of observational evidence for an accretion disc suggest that if there is accretion then it should be at a very low level .",
    "we conclude that a stellar wind should be the origin of the material inside the roche lobe of the wd in qs vir .",
    "nevertheless , with such a low m it is hard to believe that any shock or collision will actually form from that material , which was the interpretation of for the features inside the wd roche lobe , also observed in our h@xmath50 trailed spectrum and doppler maps .",
    "material outside the roche lobe or inside the lobe of the wd can not be in a stable orbital motion with the system unless it is kept there by some factor other than gravity .",
    "an interesting alternative could be a gas cloud locked with the m star by a magnetic prominence system , as has been reported by @xcite .    using a light curve inversion method we assess the details in the brightness distribution of the m star at six epochs of asymmetric light curves ( using data from and @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : clt ] we present our results for the epochs of observations that have good orbital coverage , namely jd2 , jd3 , jd5 and jd6 . in jd2 , there are two bright active regions centered at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which seem to be shifted slightly in phase ( @xmath74 ) in jd3 . the jd3 map , in turn ,",
    "is dominated by a strong flare ; which will be commented later . from the partial light curves of jd1 and jd4",
    ", we have indications that these activity locations are also present during those epochs of observations .",
    "interestingly , active regions at approximately the same region appears in jd5 and jd6 .",
    "the stability of active regions with time prompts to the consistency of active longitudes in rs cvn and fk comae systems .",
    "@xcite find that such stable active regions correspond to locations where magnetic flux tubes of opposite polarity emerge on the surface of the stars .",
    "although similar high - resolution long - term data are not available for qs vir , it will be interesting to investigate if such active regions evolve in latitude - as is suggested by the analysis of the jd5/jd6 data sets - in synchronism with activity cycles of the m star , or if such cycles have no effect on the location of the activity regions in qs  vir - type binaries .",
    "possible implications on the level of magnetic braking in such systems ( and consequently on the evolution of pre - cvs ) remain to be determined .    at jd3",
    "the flare appears during eclipse and disappears half a cycle later as the binary rotates .",
    "the flare is likely located between @xmath41 and @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : clt ] ) , centered on @xmath48 . furthermore ,",
    "in our spectra , the ews of the total h@xmath50 emission line indicate that a flare was also present during our spectroscopic observations .",
    "the ews analysis place the source of the variation at the back side of the m star , which is confirmed by the doppler maps , reconstructed with the same data set .",
    "this does not come as a surprise , since this m star seems to be very active at all epochs of relevant observations ( eg . ) .",
    "regarding the decrement observed in the intensity of the balmer lines - i.e. the component been stronger in h@xmath50 with decreasing intensity for the other balmer components , we believe that the m star has experienced a solar - like flare .",
    "no similar structure at or close to that same region is found in the doppler map of , supporting the suggestion that this is a transient feature .",
    "a remarkable property of this system is its apparently high recurrence rate of flares which , in principle , could assist material finding its way to the wd . in the context of close detached binaries , there is evidence that tidal interactions can induce the emergence of magnetic flux tubes at preferred longitudes on the surface of the star . with this scenario",
    "it is possible to explain the presence of material co - rotating with the binary within the roche lobe of the wd in qs vir as material trapped in magnetic loops from the m star .",
    "changes of the position of the corresponding feature will occur accordingly with the regeneration / evolution of the gas cloud and the geometry of the magnetic field of the m star at that location .",
    "@xcite measured a flux ratio of h@xmath50/h@xmath75 for the gas cloud of the post t tauri star rx j1508.6 - 4423 ; our respective value is h@xmath50/h@xmath76 for the equivalent structure , in agreement with this interpretation .",
    "the main results of our time - resolved photometry and optical spectroscopy can be summarized as follows :    * we provided light curve models of qs vir , which ( combined with the subsequent determination of k@xmath31 ) constraining of the binary parameters .",
    "the size of the m star yields a distance to the system of @xmath77 pc .",
    "we also find that the m star radius is smaller than its roche lobe radius at a 2-@xmath71 confidense level which , therefore , suggests that accretion does not take place via roche lobe overflow in qs vir .",
    "the main binary parameters results are summarized in table [ tab : params ] . * surface images of the m star were constructed and show four active regions with two different morphologies .",
    "there are two cool spotted regions 0.5 in phase apart and two hot active regions also 0.5 in phase apart .",
    "this configuration is persistent during a flare observed on the jd3 light curves and in the jd5/jd6 data .",
    "the different data sets jd1 to jd4 and jd5/jd6 are separated by @xmath78 yrs .",
    "the spot responsible for the flare on the jd3 data is centered at @xmath79 and occupies a sizable fraction of the star surface , with an azimuthal width of @xmath80 .",
    "* we have measured the rvs of the multi - component h@xmath50 emission line and of other balmer and ca@xmath51 h&k emission lines as well as of the tio band .",
    "the results indicate that the chromospheric emission lines have larger k velocities than that expected for the centre of mass of the m star ( as measured by the tio band ) .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tab : el_par ] .",
    "* analysis of our time resolved spectroscopy and doppler images of the h@xmath50 emission line argue against the interpretation of the structures seen on the wd side of the binary as a result of low level accretion stream shock .",
    "it is likely that it is a result of wind accretion onto the wd .",
    "if the material inside the roche lobe of the wd is long - lived , we suggest that it can be held in place by a prominence - like magnetic loop in a manner similar to that observed on single active stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the detection of h@xmath50 emission from the wd side of the binary was interpreted as a residual of a previous accretion state of qs vir , suggestive that this is a hibernating cv . with the data in hand",
    ", we can not examine the long term spectroscopic behavior of the system in order to compare the location and strength of the material inside the roche lobe of the wd with time , and assess its stability and persistence .",
    "our data also provide no indication that qs vir bears characteristics of a hibernating cv .",
    "since this is one of the few well - studied detached m dwarf - wd binaries , future observations complementing our work can assess the nature and stability of the active regions on the surface of the m star , and their role in angular momentum loss via magnetic braking , which drives the evolution of such systems .",
