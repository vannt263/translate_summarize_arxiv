    "matter exhibits several different phases , as shown in fig .  1 , depending on external parameters . at temperature ,",
    "higher than the deconfinement temperature ( @xmath1  mev ) , quarks confined in the nucleons get liberated and matter becomes a quark - gluon plasma , as happened in the very early universe .",
    "similarly , also at extremely high density , where the fermi momentum of nucleons in matter is larger than @xmath2 gev or so as in the core of compact stars like neutron stars , the wavefunction of quarks in nucleons will overlap with that of quarks in other nucleons due to asymptotic freedom . at such high density , quarks are no longer confined in nucleons and thus the nuclear matter will become a quark matter , where rather weakly interacting quarks move around  @xcite .",
    "c    the fermi surface of quark matter at high density is unstable at low temperature , a phenomenon called cooper instability , against forming pairs of quarks or holes , if attraction exists between a pair of quarks or holes with opposite momenta .",
    "no matter how small the attraction is , it will dominate any repulsive forces at low energy , since the attraction between a pair of quarks or holes with opposite momenta is a relevant operator while all repulsive forces become irrelevant as one scales down toward the fermi sea  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that color anti - triplet diquark condensates are energetically most preferred among possible pairings , including particle - hole parings or density waves  @xcite .    intense study on color superconductivity  @xcite shows that superconducting quark matter has two different phases , depending on density .   at intermediate density ,",
    "the cooper pair is color anti - triplet but flavor singlet , breaking only the color symmetry down to a subgroup , @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are flavor and color indices , respectively . for high density where the chemical potential is larger than the strange quark mass , @xmath7 , the strange quark participates in cooper - pairing .",
    "at such a high density , the cooper - pair condensate is predicted to take a so - called color - flavor locking ( cfl ) form  @xcite , breaking not only color symmetry but also flavor symmetry maximally : @xmath8 at much higher density ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 and the color - flavor locking phase is shown to be energetically preferred  @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of the attractive forces that lead to cooper instability , depending on the density . at the intermediate density , where @xmath11 or @xmath12 , the qcd interaction is approximated with four - quark interactions ,",
    "@xmath13 since both electric and magnetic gluons are screened due to the medium effect .",
    "this short - range attraction is precisely the bcs type interaction , which is generated in metal by the exchange of massive phonons .",
    "the cooper pair gap is then given by  @xcite @xmath14,\\ ] ] which is estimated to be @xmath15 mev , for @xmath16 and @xmath17 are of the order of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is of the order of one at the intermediate density . on the other hand , though electric gluons are screened in quark matter , the magnetic gluons are not screened at high density even at a nonperturbative level , as argued convincingly by son  @xcite .",
    "thus the cooper - pairing force at high density is long - ranged and the gap equation is so - called the eliashberg equation .",
    "the ( long - range ) magnetic gluon exchange interaction leads to an extra ( infrared ) logarithmic divergence in the gap equation , which is in hard - dense loop ( hdl ) approximation given as , @xmath20 where @xmath21 with a gauge parameter @xmath22 . by solving the gap equation ( [ gapf ] ) ,",
    "one finds the cooper pair gap to be  @xcite instead of @xmath23 , taken in  @xcite , we would get the usual value , @xmath24 , instead of @xmath25 for @xmath26 in the prefactor . ]",
    "@xmath27    though the ground state of quark matter is a color superconductor , one needs to know its criticality to observe color superconductivity in the laboratory or in stellar objects .",
    "the quark matter which might exist in the core of compact stars like neutron stars will be in the superconducting phase if the interior temperature of compact stars is lower than the critical temperature and the density is higher than the critical density . for the neutron stars ,",
    "the inner temperature is estimated to be @xmath28 and the core density is around @xmath29  @xmath30 , which is ten times higher than the normal nuclear matter density  @xcite .",
    "since the critical temperature of bcs superconductivity is given as  @xcite @xmath31 the critical temperature of color superconductivity at the intermediate density is quite large ; @xmath32 - 50  mev . in dense qcd with unscreened magnetic gluons ,",
    "the critical temperature turns out to take the bcs type value  @xcite , @xmath33 , though the pairing force is very different from that of the bcs superconductivity .",
    "since the unscreened magnetic gluons give a much bigger gap than the usual bcs type gap , the critical temperature of color superconductvity is quite large compared to the interior temperature of neutron stars , regardless of the form of attractive forces .",
    "it is instructive to derive the critical temperature for the color superconductivity at high density where the pairing is mediated by the unscreened magnetic gluons .",
    "we start with the zero temperature cooper - pair gap equation , eq .",

    "but , as the density becomes lower , one has to take into account the effect of antiquarks . in the high density",
    "effective theory , this effect is incorporated in the higher order operators  @xcite .",
    "first , we add the leading @xmath66 corrections to the gap equation eq .",

    "we note that since the @xmath66 correction to the quark - gluon vertex does not depend on the fermi velocity of the quark , it generates a repulsion for quark pairs , bound by magnetic forces . for a constant gap approximation , @xmath70 ,",

    "since the phase transition for color superconducting phase is believed to be of first order  @xcite , we may assume that the gap has the same dependence on the chemical potential @xmath23 as the leading order .",
    "then , the critical density for the color superconducting phase transition is given by @xmath74.\\ ] ] therefore , if the strong interaction coupling is too strong at the scale of the chemical potential , the gap does not form .",
    "in other words , the chemical potential has to be bigger than a critical value , @xmath75 , which is about the same as the one estimated in the literature  @xcite .",

    "there is only one such diagram ( see fig .",
    "2 ) in the leading order hdl approximation .    0.3 in = 2.0 in",

    "but , due to the global color and flavor symmetry , only three of them are independent . similarly to the condensate , the gap can be also diagonalized by the color and flavor symmetry as @xmath94 without loss of generality , we can take @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "then , the vacuum energy becomes @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a complicate function of @xmath100 that has a maximum at @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the vacuum energy has a global minimum when @xmath103 , or in terms of the eigenvalues of the gap @xmath104 among nine quarks , @xmath105 , eight of them have ( majorana ) mass @xmath106 , forming an octet under @xmath107 , and one of them , a singlet under @xmath107 , has @xmath108 .    since the condensate is related to the off - diagonal component of the quark propagator at high momentum as , suppressing the color and flavor indices , @xmath109,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the anomalous dimension of the condensate and the ellipsis are less singular terms .",
    "being proportional to the gap , the condensate is diagonalized in the basis where the gap is diagonalized .",
    "thus , we have shown that in the hdl approximation the true ground state of qcd with three massless flavors at high density is the color - flavor locking phase , @xmath111 for all @xmath112 .",
    "the condensate takes @xmath113 breaking the color symmetry , @xmath114 , the chiral symmetry , and the baryon number symmetry .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern of the cfl phase is therefore @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the diagonal subgroup of three @xmath107 groups and the generator of @xmath117 is a linear combination of the color hypercharge and @xmath114 generator , @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "in the cfl phase of color superconductors , there are 8 pseudo nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons and one genuine ng boson . since the ( pseudo )",
    "ng bosons are very light , they constitute the low - lying excitations of the cfl phase , together with the modified photon , which are relevant in the low energy phenomena like the cooling process of color superconductors .",
    "the pseudo ng bosons will get mass due to interactions , that break @xmath107 chiral symmetry , such as dirac mass terms  @xcite electromagnetic interactions  @xcite , and instantons  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that dirac mass term and intanton effects are suppressed by powers of @xmath66 at high density since they invlove anti - quarks , while the electromagnetic interaction is not . in this section",
    "we derive the meson mass due to the dirac mass term and the electromagnetic interaction , by matching the vacuum energy shift in microscopic theory ( qcd ) and the effective theory of mesons , which was used in  @xcite .",
    "but , we present the calculation , using the effective theory constucted in  @xcite , as was done by beane _ et .",
    "al _  @xcite . as in  @xcite , if we introduce the charge conjugated field @xmath120 with @xmath121 and decompose the quark field into states ( @xmath122 ) near the fermi surface and the states ( @xmath123 ) deep in the dirac sea , the dirac mass term can be rewritten as @xmath124 which becomes , if one integrates out the antiquarks ( @xmath123 or @xmath125 ) , @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the antiquark propagators , propagating into the antiquark field itself or its charge - conjugated field , respectively .",
    "antiquark fields propagate into their charge conjugated fields only if they have a majorana mass and thus the meson mass due to dirac mass is zero if the antiquark majoran mass is zero .    at first",
    "one may think that the majorana mass of antiquarks is zero , since it is energetically not prefered for them to develop a condensate due to the gap ( @xmath129 ) to create an antiquark .",
    "but , it is shown  @xcite that the antiquark fields get a radiative majorana mass , which is equal to the cooper - pair gap of quarks near the fermi surface , since all the symmetries that forbid the majorana mass term for antiquarks are broken once the cooper gap is open for the quarks near the fermi surface .",
    "having shown that the antiquarks have same majorana mass as quarks near the fermi surface , we may write the inverse propagator of the nambu - gorkov antiquark field , @xmath130 , as @xmath131 where the projector @xmath132 is to project out the states in the dirac sea , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and we decompose @xmath135 with @xmath136 in the second line . since the states in the dirac sea can propagate into their charge conjugated states via the radiatively generated majorana mass term , eq",
    "( [ dmass ] ) becomes @xmath137 where @xmath138 and the ellipsis denotes the terms higher order in @xmath66 .",
    "then , the vacuum energy shift due to the dirac mass term is @xmath139 in the leading order , which has to be matched with the vacuum energy in the meson lagrangian , @xmath140 with the pion decay constant @xmath141  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one finds the meson mass due to the dirac mass @xmath142  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction also contributes to the meson mass , since it breaks the @xmath107 flavor symmetry . among 8 pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons , four of them",
    "have the unbrken @xmath143 charge and receive a correction,@xcite   @xmath144^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath145 .",
    "finally , the instanton breaks the chiral symmetry and contributes to the meson masss .",
    "but , its effect at high density is suppressed by @xmath146 for three flavors  @xcite and thus negligible .",
    "in this cfl phase , the particle spectrum can be precisely mapped into that of the hadronic phase at low density . observing this map , schfer and wilczek  @xcite",
    "further conjectured that two phases are in fact continuously connected to each other .",
    "the cfl phase at high density is complementary to the hadronic phase at low density .",
    "this conjecture was subsequently supported  @xcite by showing that quarks in the cfl phase are realized as skyrmions , called superqualitons , just like baryons are realized as skyrmions in the hadronic phase .",
    "this phase continuity can be explained heuristically in the following thought experiment .",
    "suppose we inject a hydrogen atom into a cfl color superconductor as in fig .",
    "3 . in the color superconductor , being bombarded by energetic ( gapped ) quarks , the atom will be ionized and the quarks in the proton will get deconfined to form , for example , a cooper pair of @xmath147 and @xmath148 , leaving the up quark alone .    0.3 in = 4.0 in    from this thought experiment we find two things : the baryon number of up quark is same as that of proton , since the cfl vacuum provides the missing two thirds .",
    "as the hydrogen atom is neutral in the vacuum , the charge of up quark has to be opposite to that of electron with respect to whatever unbroken charges in the color superconductor .",
    "thereby , the gapped quarks in the cfl phase correspond to baryons in the hadronic phase .    furthermore , it is possible to bosonize the cfl color superconductor  @xcite , realizing skyrme s original motivation for the skyrmion  @xcite .",
    "we introduce a bosonic variable , @xmath149 where @xmath110 ( @xmath150 ) is the anomalous dimension of the diquark field .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath151 in terms of right - handed quarks to describe the small fluctuations of the condensate of right - handed quarks .",
    "since the bosonic fields , @xmath152 , are colored , they will interact with gluons .",
    "in fact , the colored massless excitations will constitute the longitudinal components of gluons through higgs mechanism . among the small fluctuations of condensates ,",
    "the colorless excitations correspond to genuine nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons , which can be described by a color singlet combination of @xmath152  @xcite , given as @xmath153 the ng bosons transform under the @xmath154 chiral symmetry as @xmath155    since the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the current quark mass , the instanton effects , and the electromagnetic interaction , the ng bosons will get mass , which has been calculated by various groups  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the meson mass due to the current strange quark mass ( @xmath156 , since it will be dominant for the intermediate density .",
    "then , the meson mass term is simplified as @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "( note that in general there will be two more mass terms quadratic in @xmath160 .",
    "but , they all vanish if we neglect the current mass of up and down quarks and also the small color - sextet component of the cooper pair  @xcite . )",
    "thus , the low - energy effective lagrangian density for the bosonic fields in the cfl phase can be written as @xmath161+{\\cal l}_m     + g_{s}g_{\\mu}^{a}j^{\\mu a}+\\cdots , \\label{eff_lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath162 is the lagrangian of higgsed gluons , @xmath163 , and the ellipsis denotes the higher order terms in the derivative expansion , including mixing terms between @xmath164 and @xmath151 .",
    "the gluons couple to the bosonic fields through a minimal coupling with a conserved current , given as @xmath165 where the ellipsis denotes the currents from the higher order derivative terms in eq .",
    "( [ eff_lag ] ) .",
    "@xmath166 is a quantity analogous to the pion decay constant , calculated to be @xmath141 in the cfl color superconductor  @xcite .",

    "the coefficients of the wzw terms in the effective lagrangian ( [ eff_lag ] ) have been shown to be @xmath173 by matching the flavor anomalies  @xcite , which is later confirmed by an explicit calculation  @xcite .",
    "now , let us try to describe the cfl color superconductor in terms of the bosonic variables .",
    "we start with the effective lagrangian ( [ eff_lag ] ) , which is good at low energy , without putting in the quark fields . as in the skyrme model of baryons , we anticipate the gaped quarks come out as solitons , made of the bosonic degrees of freedom . that the skyrme picture can be realized in the cfl color superconductor is already shown in  @xcite , but there the mass of the soliton is not properly calculated . here ,",
    "by identifying the correct ground state of the cfl superconductor in the bosonic description , we find the superqualitons have same quantum numbers as quarks with mass of the order of gap , showing that they are really the gaped quarks in the cfl color superconductor . furthermore",
    ", upon quantizing the zero modes of the soliton , we find that high spin excitations of the soliton have energy of order of @xmath23 , way beyond the scale where the effective bosonic description is applicable , which we interpret as the absence of high - spin quarks , in agreement with the fermionic description .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as we will see below , by calculating the soliton mass in the bosonic description , one finds the coupling and the chemical potential dependence of the cooper - pair gap , at least numerically , which gives us a complementary way , if not better , of estimating the gap .    as the baryon number ( or the quark number )",

    "the ground state of the system in the bosonic description is a @xmath0-matter whose energy per unit quark number is @xmath192 .",

    "in the fermionic description , this corresponds that we excite a gaped quark in the fermi sea into a free state , which costs energy at least @xmath195 . in the bosonic description , this amounts to creating a superqualiton out of the @xmath0-matter , while reducing the quark number of the @xmath0-matter by one .",
    "therefore , since we gain energy @xmath192 by reducing the quark number of the @xmath0-matter by one , the energy cost to create a gapped quark from the ground state is @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the energy of the superqualiton configuration . since @xmath198 , we see that the energy of the superqualiton configuration is almost canceled out by @xmath192 to give the gap much smaller than @xmath193 or @xmath23 . varing the strange quark mass ,",
    "we find numerically that the twice of u- and s - superqualiton masses are given as @xmath199 from the relation that @xmath200 , we can estimate numerically the coupling and the chemical potential dependence of the cooper gap  @xcite .",

    "to discuss the interaction of neutrinos in color superconductors  @xcite , we first note that gluons mix with weak gauge bosons , since the diquark condensates in color superconductors carry not only a color but also a weak charge .",

    "of course the additional enhancement of the neutrino production due to the cfl phase depends on the abundance of positrons in the system which depends mainly on the temperature .",
    "if confined colored gluons are present in the matter in the cfl phase , the same amplitude can be obtained in eq .",
    "( [ qqv ] ) when @xmath228 is replaced with @xmath229 .",
    "the result obtained above can be summarized as predicting an enhancement of the effective four - point coupling constant for the neutrino production process in the low energy limit .",
    "the enhancement due to the neutrino - color interaction is suppressed by factors of @xmath230 or @xmath231 , since it depends on the unpaired excitations above gap which can participate into neutrino - color interaction .",
    "hence for the cooling process at low temperatures as @xmath232k it is not so effective .",
    "however during the early stage of proto - neutron star the temperature is expected to be high enough @xmath233mev  @xcite to see the effect of the enhancement due to color excitations .",
    "let us now consider the weak decay of light quasi - quarks , described by the four - fermi interaction : @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the fermi constant and @xmath236 denotes the quasi - quark near the fermi surface , projected from the quark field @xmath237 as in  @xcite , @xmath238    since the four - fermi interaction of quarks with opposite momenta are marginally relevant and gets substantially enhanced at low energy , it may have significant corrections to the couplings to quarks of those weakly interacting particles  @xcite : @xmath239\\\\ & = & { 4\\over 3}{g_{\\bar 3}\\over 2\\pi}{g_f\\over\\sqrt{2 } } \\psi^{\\dagger}_{l}(\\vec v_f , x)\\psi_{l } ( \\vec v_f , x ) \\bar\\nu_l(x)\\bar v\\cdot\\gamma\\nu_l(x ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath240 are summed over and @xmath241 is the value of the marginal four - quark coupling at the screening mass scale @xmath160 . in terms of the renormalization group ( rg )",
    "equation at a scale @xmath242 @xmath243 where @xmath244 .",
    "the scale dependence of the marginal four - quark coupling in the color anti - triplet channel is calculated in  @xcite . at @xmath245 @xmath246 since @xmath247 , we get @xmath248 since the rg evolution stops at scales lower than the gap , the low energy effective fermi coupling in dense matter is therefore @xmath249 we emphasize that this enhancement applies equally to the @xmath250 decay of quarks and other neutrino production processes described in the previous section .    at asymptotic density and low temperature ( @xmath251 ) ,",
    "the relevant excitations are quasi - quarks that are not cooper - paired , and 17 nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "all other massive particles , higgsed gluons and other massive excitations are expected to be out of thermal equilibrium and decoupled .",
    "thus the main cooling processes must be the emission of weakly interacting light particles like neutrinos or other ( weakly interacting ) exotic light particles ( _ e.g. _ axions ) from the quasi - quarks and nambu - goldstone bosons in the thermal bath .    for the neutrino emissivity from quasi quarks ,",
    "the so - called urca process is relevant .",
    "the neutrino emissivity by the direct urca process in quark matter , which is possible for most cases in quark matter , was calculated by iwamoto  @xcite .",
    "for the cfl superconcductor , we expect the calculation goes in parallel and the neutrino emissivity is @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the density , @xmath34 is the temperature of the quark matter , and @xmath254 is the ratio between the electron and baryon density . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutrino emissivity by the modified urca process , which is the dominant process in the standard cooling of neutron stars  @xcite , is suppressed by @xmath255 , since the pion coupling to quarks is given by @xmath256  @xcite .",
    "thus , the neutrino emmisivity by the modified urca process in the cfl quark matter is greatly suppressed in the cfl quark matter , compared to normal quark matter .",
    "futhermore , since the pion - pion interaction in the cfl quark matter are also suppressed by @xmath257  @xcite , we note that all the low energy excitations in the cfl quark matter are extremely weakly coupled .",
    "but , since most excitations in the cfl quark matter are gapped and frozen out , the cfl quark matter has a quite small heat capacity and cools down very rapidly at temperatures lower than the gap  @xcite .    together with the general enhancement of the effective four - point coupling constant in rg analysis",
    ", the enhancement of the neutrino production implies that the cooling process speeds up as the cfl phase sets in dense hadronic matter near the critical temperature .",
    "but , at temperature much below the critical temperature , the interaction of quasi - quarks and pions and kaons is extremely weak , suppressed by @xmath257 , and the cfl quark matter cools down extremely rapidly .    for a realistic calculation of the cooling rate of compact stars",
    ", we need to also consider the neutrino propagation in the cfl matter before the neutrinos come out of the system .",
    "a recent study  @xcite suggests that the presence of the cfl phase can accelerate the cooling process because neutrino interactions with matter are reduced in the presence of a superconducting gap @xmath258 .",
    "however this result is subject to modification by the effect of additional interactions  not taken into account in this work  mediated by the colored gluons on the quark polarization .",
    "it would be interesting to see how the enhancement of the neutrino production correlates with the neutrino - medium interaction .",
    "this is one of the physically relevant questions on how the enhanced neutrino interaction could affect neutron - star(proto neutron star ) cooling following supernova explosion .",
    "this issue is currently under investigation .",
    "i have discussed some aspects of the exciting recent developments in color superconductivity in high density quark matter .",
    "i have calculated the cooper pair gap and the critical points at high density where magnetic gluons are not screened .",
