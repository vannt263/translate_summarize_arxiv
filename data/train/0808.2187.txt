    "microscopic _ ab - initio _ many - body approaches have significantly progressed in recent years @xcite .",
    "nowdays , due to increased computing power and novel techniques , _ ab - initio _ calculations are able to reproduce a large number of observables for atomic nuclei with mass up to a=14 .",
    "the light nuclei have also served as a crucial site to recognize the important role of three - body forces and three - body correlations .",
    "approaches like the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite , the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) @xcite and the coupled - cluster theory with single and double excitations ( ccsd ) @xcite can be formally extended for heavier nuclei .",
    "however , the explosive growth in computational power , required to achieve convergent results , severely hinders the detailed _ ab - initio _ studies of heavier , a@xmath3 , nuclei . in the case of the ncsm ,",
    "the slow convergence of the calculated energies is caused by the adoption of a two - body cluster approximation , which does not take many - body correlations into account .",
    "straightforward employment of the three - body and higher - body interactions dramatically complicates the problem , even for light nuclei .",
    "an alternative approach is to construct a small - space effective two - body interaction , which would account for the many - body correlations for the a - body system in a large space .",
    "attempts to include many - body correlations approximately modifying the one - body part of the effective two - body hamiltonian and employing a unitary transformation have been reported recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive a valence space ( @xmath1 ) effective two - body interaction that accounts for all the core - polarization effects available in the _ ab - initio _ ncsm wavefunctions .",
    "first , in the framework of the ncsm , we construct the effective hamiltonians on the two - body cluster level for a=6 systems in the @xmath4 space .",
    "@xmath5 represents the limit on the total oscillator quanta ( n ) above the minimum configuration .",
    "we take @xmath5 values from 2 to 12 .",
    "second , following the original idea of ref .",
    "@xcite , we employ an unitary many - body transformation and obtain the effective two - body hamiltonian in the @xmath6 space ( p - shell space ) , which exactly reproduces the lowest , @xmath6 space dominated , eigenstates of the 6-body hamiltonian in the large @xmath4 space .",
    "third , we perform ncsm calculations for a=4 and a=5 systems with the effective hamiltonian constructed on the two - body cluster level for the a=6 system and determine the core and one - body parts of the effective two - body hamiltonian for a=6 in the p - shell space .",
    "finally , the procedure is generalized for arbitrary mass number a. we analyze the properties of the constructed two - body hamiltonians , investigate their efficiency to reproduce the observables of different a - body systems calculated in large @xmath4 spaces and study the role of the effective p - shell space three - body interaction .",
    "the starting point of the no core shell model ( ncsm ) approach is the bare , exact a - body hamiltonian constrained by the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the one - body ho hamiltonian @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a bare nn interaction @xmath11 modified by the term introducing a- and @xmath12-dependent corrections to offset the ho potential present in @xmath8 : @xmath13 the eigenvalue problem for the exact a - body hamiltonian ( [ homa ] ) for @xmath14 is very complicated technically , since an extremely large a - body ho basis is required to obtain converged results .",
    "however , the @xmath15 problem is considerably simpler . for many realistic nn interactions its solution in the relative ho basis with",
    "@xmath16 accounts well for the short range correlations and is a precise approximation for the infinite space ( @xmath17 ) result .",
    "this allows one to adopt the two - body cluster approximation to construct the ncsm effective two - body hamiltonian @xmath18 for an a - body system in an @xmath19 space of tractable dimension , where the lower index @xmath20 stands for the number of particles in the cluster .",
    "this approximation consists of solving eq.([homa ] ) for the @xmath21 body subsystem of a leading to @xmath22 the information about the total number of interacting particles a enters the bare @xmath23 hamiltonian through the second term in the right hand side of ( [ voma ] ) .",
    "next , we find the unitary transformation @xmath24 which reduces the bare @xmath23 hamiltonian in the `` infinite space '' ( @xmath25 ) to the diagonal form : @xmath26 where , for the sake of simplicity , we omit the index @xmath27 for @xmath24 and keep only the index @xmath20 indicating the order of cluster approximation .",
    "the matrix @xmath24 can be split into 4 blocks : @xmath28 where the square @xmath29 @xmath30 matrix corresponds to the p - space ( or model space ) of dimension @xmath31 , characterized by the chosen @xmath5 value .",
    "taking into account that the @xmath32 matrix has a diagonal form @xmath33 one can calculate the effective @xmath34 hamiltonian using the following formula :    @xmath35    it is easy to show by inserting eq.([homa2e ] ) into the eq.([heff1 ] ) , and taking into account eq.([udec ] ) that the unitary transformation ( [ heff1 ] ) is equivalent to the commonly used unitary transformation @xcite and that eq.([heff1 ] ) is identical to the eqs.(15,16 ) from @xcite .",
    "we note , that , by using eq.([heff1 ] ) one does not need to calculate and store a large number of matrix elements of the @xmath36-operator ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) . furthermore , the decoupling condition @xmath38 is automatically satisfied , which is obvious from the diagonal form of the @xmath32 matrix .",
    "we note that our treatment of center - of - mass motion remains the same as in the ncsm ( ref .",
    "we initiate all effective interaction developments at the a - body level , and , through a series of steps , arrive at a smaller space effective interaction appropriate for the a - body system . for this reason ,",
    "our derived effective hamiltonians have their first subscript as `` a '' .",
    "the next step of the traditional ncsm prescription is to construct the full a - body hamiltonian using the effective two - body hamiltonian ( [ heff1 ] ) and to diagonalize it in the a - body @xmath5 model space .",
    "as we increase the number of nucleons , the dimension of the corresponding @xmath5 model space increases very rapidly . for instance , up - to - date computing resources allow us to go as high as @xmath39 for the lower part of the p - shell ( a=5,6 ) @xcite , while already for the upper part of the p - shell ( a@xmath4015 ) , we are limited to @xmath41 .",
    "the computational eigenvalue problem for many - body systems is complicated because of the very large matrix dimensions involved .",
    "the largest dimension of the model space that we encountered in this study for @xmath42li with @xmath43 exceeds @xmath44 . to solve this problem",
    "we have used the specialized version of the shell - model code antoine @xcite , recently adapted for the ncsm @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ncsm calculation for the a=6 system in the @xmath43 space yields nearly converged energies for the lowest states dominated by the @xmath45 components , while there is incomplete convergence for @xmath46 in @xmath41 space .",
    "therefore , considering the @xmath43 ncsm results as exact solutions for the lowest @xmath45 dominated 6-body states , we may construct the @xmath47 space hamiltonian for the a=6 system , which exactly reproduces those @xmath43 eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "moreover , if it is possible to solve the 6-body problem for a=6 , then it is possible to solve the 6-body problem for arbitrary a , using the corresponding effective hamiltonian @xmath34 obtained in the two - body cluster approximation .",
    "this means that we can determine for any a - body system the effective hamiltonian in the @xmath47 space , which accounts for 6-body cluster dynamics in the large @xmath43 space .",
    "to generalize , we start by defining the procedure for determining the effective hamiltonian matrix elements for the @xmath48-body cluster in the a - nucleon system .",
    "we do this by constructing the full @xmath48-body hamiltonian using the effective 2-body hamiltonian ( [ heff1 ] ) and diagonalizing it in the @xmath5 model space . in the spirit of eq.([homa2 ] ) , this yields the eigenenergies @xmath49 of the @xmath48-body system and their corresponding @xmath48 eigenvectors which make up the unitary transformation matrix @xmath50 .",
    "these @xmath48-body results can then be projected into a smaller , secondary @xmath51-space , given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 , where , similar to eqs.([udec ] ) and ( [ edec ] ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be split into parts related to the two spaces , @xmath51 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "the new secondary effective hamiltonian then takes the following general form :    @xmath56    where the @xmath12 superscript on the left - hand side is omitted for the sake of simplicity . as stated earlier",
    ", the new index @xmath48 determines the order of the cluster approximation in the smaller @xmath51 space , _ i.e. _ , @xmath53 .",
    "because the @xmath51 space has @xmath53 , the projection into this space `` freezes '' some number of the @xmath48 nucleons into fixed single particle configurations , which can be thought of as the `` inert core '' states in the standard shell model ( ssm ) approach .",
    "consequently , it is possible to write @xmath48 as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the number of nucleons making up the core configuration , while @xmath59 refers to the size of valence cluster .",
    "for instance , in the case of p - shell nuclei , @xmath60 , so , if @xmath61 ( _ i.e. _ the 5-body cluster approximation ) , then the effective hamiltonian @xmath62 is simply a one - body hamiltonian ( @xmath63 ) appropriate for the a - nucleon system .",
    "similarly , for the 6-body cluster approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath64 , we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath65 , which is a two - body hamiltonian ( @xmath66 ) for the a - body system , and , so on for larger values of @xmath48 .",
    "whatever the value of @xmath59 is , the effective hamiltonian @xmath67 contains the information about the @xmath48-body dynamics in the original large @xmath19 space , since it reproduces exactly the lowest @xmath68 eigenvalues @xmath69 of the @xmath48-body hamiltonian in the @xmath19 space , where @xmath68 is a dimension of the @xmath51 space .    in the case of a doubly magic",
    "closed shell with two extra nucleons i.e. , @xmath70 , _ etc .",
    "_ , the dimension of the effective hamiltonian @xmath71 is a 2-body ( @xmath66 ) hamiltonian in the p- , sd- , pf - spaces , _ etc .",
    "_ , respectively .",
    "this means that the secondary effective hamiltonian ( [ heff2 ] ) contains only 1-body and 2-body terms , even after the _ exact _ a - body cluster transformation .",
    "this effective hamiltonian ( [ heff2 ] ) , which now contains the correlation energy of a nucleons , is the correct one - body plus two - body hamiltonian to use in a ssm calculation with inert core .",
    "the @xmath72 nucleon - spectators fully occupy the shells below the valence shell and the total a - body wave - function can be exactly factorized as the @xmath58-body `` core '' and the valence 2-body wave functions .",
    "this considerably simplifies the calculation of the effective hamiltonian , because only the @xmath6 part ( p@xmath73-space part ) of the complete @xmath4 wave function needs to be specified .",
    "utilizing the approach outlined above , we have calculated effective p - shell hamiltonians for @xmath74li , using the 6-body hamiltonians with @xmath75 and @xmath76 mev , constructed from the inoy ( inside nonlocal outside yukawa ) interaction @xcite .",
    "this is a new type of interaction , which has local behavior appropriate for traditional nn interactions at longer ranges , but exhibits a nonlocality at shorter distances .",
    "the nonlocality of the nn interaction has been introduced in order to account effectively for three - nucleon ( nnn ) interactions which correctly describe the nnn bound states @xmath77h and @xmath77he , whereas still reproducing nn scattering data with high precision .",
    "the corresponding excitation energies of p - shell dominated states and the binding energy of @xmath74li are shown in fig.[spectra6li14hw ] as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the dimension of the configurational space for the @xmath43 case considered is 48 million ( m - scheme ) . a two orders of magnitude increase in the size of the model space , as compared to the previous @xmath78 study @xcite , allows us to determine a converged value of 31.681 mev for the @xmath42li binding energy .",
    "furthermore , the excitation energy of the highest lying p - space state , @xmath79 , is lowered by an amount of 2.1 mev in comparison to the @xmath78 case , indicating improved convergence for both the excited states and ground state for @xmath43 .    in the ssm an effective two - body hamiltonian for a nucleus with mass number",
    "a is represented in terms of three components : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the inert core part associated with the interaction of the nucleons occupying closed shells , @xmath82 is the one - body part corresponding to the interaction of valence nucleons with core nucleons , and @xmath83 is the two - body part referring to the interaction between valence particles .",
    "it is usually assumed that the core and one - body parts are constant for an arbitrary number of valence particles and that only the two - body part @xmath83 may contain mass dependence that includes effects of three - body and higher - body interactions .    to represent the @xmath84 hamiltonian in the ssm format",
    ", we develop a valence cluster expansion ( vce ) , @xmath85 where the lower index , k , stands for the k - body interaction in the @xmath59-body valence cluster ( @xmath86 ) ; the first upper index a for the mass dependence ; and the second upper index , @xmath87 for the number of particles contributing to the corresponding k - body part .",
    "thus , we consider the more general case of allowing the core ( k=0 ) , one - body ( k=1 ) and other k - body parts to vary with the mass number a. this appears necessary to include the a - dependence of the excitations of the core ( @xmath58 ) nucleons treated in the original n@xmath88 basis space . for the a=6 case the two - body valence cluster ( 2bvc )",
    "approximation is exact : @xmath89 where the core part , @xmath90 , is defined as the ground state @xmath91 energy of @xmath92he calculated in the @xmath19 space with the tbmes of the primary effective hamiltonian , @xmath93 for a=6 .",
    "then the one - body part , @xmath94,is determined as @xmath95 the tbmes of the one - body part , @xmath94 , @xmath96 may be represented in terms of single particle energies ( spe ) , @xmath97 : @xmath98 where the index a ( as well as b , c , and d ) denotes the set of single particle ho quantum numbers @xmath99 , upper index stands for proton ( p ) and neutron ( n ) , and the e(@xmath100li , j ) , e(@xmath100he , j ) are ncsm energies of the lowest @xmath101 and @xmath102 states calculated in the @xmath4 space for the @xmath103-body system using the tbmes of the @xmath104 effective hamiltonian , @xmath105 , which includes coulomb energy .",
    "finally , the two - body part @xmath106 is obtained by subtracting of two hamiltonians : @xmath107 it is worth noting that since the coulomb energy is included in the original hamiltonian , the proton - proton ( pp ) , neutron - neutron ( nn ) and proton - neutron ( pn ) @xmath108 tbmes of the two - body part , @xmath109 , have different values .",
    "the pn tbmes of the core , one - body and two - body parts of the expanded hamiltonian for @xmath42li are listed in the table i.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     obtained results indicate that accounting for the effective 3-body interactions considerably improves the agreement with the exact ncsm for the @xmath110he , does not bring much change for @xmath111he and yields worse results for @xmath112he ( see fig.[he8 - 9 ] ) .    performing a similar calculation with the effective interaction obtained in the 3bvc approximation starting from the cd - bonn interaction @xcite , we obtained results which are shown in fig.[he8 - 9cd ] .",
    "note , that the effective cd - bonn interaction constructed in the 2bvc approximation considerably underbinds the he isotopes in comparison to the exact ncsm results .",
    "the subsequent employment of the 3bvc approximation compensates these large differences and yields much better results for @xmath112he .",
    "however , to draw more quantitative conclusion about the 3-body and higher - body effective interactions , one needs to perform exact diagonalization using the 3bmes",
    ". we will evaluate this effect in future studies .",
    "within the ncsm approach we can calculate , by exact projection , full a - nucleon dependent tbmes ( and 3bmes ) . these a - dependent tbmes ( and 3bmes ) can be separated into core , one - body and two - body ( and three - body ) parts , all of which are also a - dependent , contrary to the ssm approach .",
    "when these a - dependent effective one- and two - body ( and three - body ) interactions are employed in ssm calculations , they exactly reproduce full ncsm calculations for a=6 ( a=7 ) isobars and yield results in good agreement with full ncsm calculations for @xmath113 performed in large basis spaces .",
    "our results for @xmath113 , which include the 3-body effective interaction , indicate that 3- and higher - body effective interactions may play an important role in determining their binding energies and spectra .",
    "future investigations will be extended to include effective 3-body interactions exactly and to explore other physical operators , such as transition operators and em moments .",
