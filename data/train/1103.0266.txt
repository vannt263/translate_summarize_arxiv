    "mh schemes are then further developed and analyzed in  @xcite , while their throughput per s ",
    "d pair scales far slower than @xmath14 .",
    "recent results  @xcite have shown that an almost linear throughput in the radio network , i.e. @xmath15 for an arbitrarily small @xmath16 , which is the best we can hope for , is achievable by using a hierarchical cooperation ( hc ) strategy .",
    "besides the schemes in  @xcite , there have been other studies to improve the throughput of wireless radio networks up to a linear scaling in a variety of network scenarios by using novel techniques such as networks with node mobility  @xcite , interference alignment  @xcite , and infrastructure support  @xcite .",
    "together with the studies in terrestrial radio networks , the interest in study of underwater networks has been growing , due to recent advances in acoustic communication technology  @xcite . in underwater acoustic communication systems ,",
    "both bandwidth and received signal power are severely limited owing to the exponential ( rather than polynomial ) path - loss attenuation with long propagation distance and the frequency - dependent attenuation .",
    "this is a main feature that distinguishes underwater systems from wireless radio links .",
    "hence , the system throughput is affected by not only the transmission distance but also the useful bandwidth .",
    "based on these characteristics , network coding schemes  @xcite have been presented for underwater acoustic channels , while network coding showed better performance than mh routing in terms of reducing transmission power .",
    "mh networking has further been investigated in other simple but realistic network conditions that take into account the practical issues of coding and delay  @xcite .",
    "one natural question is what are the fundamental capabilities of underwater networks in supporting a multiplicity of nodes that wish to communicate concurrently with each other , i.e. , multiple s ",
    "d pairs , over an acoustic channel . to answer this question , the throughput scaling for underwater networks",
    "was first studied  @xcite , where @xmath0 nodes were arbitrarily located in a planar disk of unit area , as in  @xcite , and the carrier frequency was set to a constant independent of @xmath0 . that work showed an upper bound on the throughput of each node , based on the physical model  @xcite , which scales as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 corresponds to the spreading factor of the underwater channel and @xmath19 represents the branch zero of the lambert w function  @xcite . and the branch satisfying @xmath20 is denoted by @xmath21 . ] since the spreading factor typically has values in the range @xmath22  @xcite , the throughput per node decreases almost as @xmath23 for large enough @xmath0 , which is considerably faster than the @xmath24 scaling characterized for wireless radio settings  @xcite .    in this paper , capacity scaling laws for underwater networks are analyzed in two fundamental but different networks : extended networks  @xcite of unit node density and dense networks  @xcite of unit area . of nodes .",
    "in underwater networks , we leave this issue for further study . ] unlike the work in  @xcite , the _ information - theoretic _ notion of network capacity is adopted in terms of characterizing the model for successful transmission . especially , we are interested in the case where the carrier frequency scales as a certain function of @xmath0 in a narrow - band model",
    ". such an assumption leads to a significant change in the scaling behavior owing to the attenuation characteristics .",
    "recently , the optimal capacity scaling of wireless radio networks has been studied in  @xcite according to operating regimes that are determined by the relationship between the carrier frequency and the number @xmath0 of nodes .",
    "the frequency scaling scenario of our study essentially follows the same arguments as those in  @xcite .",
    "we aim to study both information - theoretic upper bounds and achievable rate scalings while allowing the frequency scaling with @xmath0 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such an attempt has never been done before in underwater networks .",
    "we explicitly characterize an _",
    "attenuation parameter _ that depends on the transmission distance and also on the carrier frequency , and then identify fundamental operating regimes depending on the parameter . for networks with @xmath0 regularly distributed nodes , we derive upper bounds on the total throughput scaling using the cut - set bound . in extended networks ,",
    "our upper bound is based on the characteristics of power - limited regimes shown in  @xcite .",
    "we show that the upper bound is inversely proportional to the attenuation parameter .",
    "this leads to a highly power - limited network for all the operating regimes , where power consumption is important in determining performance .",
    "interestingly , it is seen that contrary to the case of wireless radio networks , our upper bound heavily depends on the attenuation parameter but not on the spreading factor ( corresponding to the path - loss exponent in wireless networks ) . on the other hand , in dense networks",
    ", our upper bound basically follows the arguments , similarly as in  @xcite : there exists either a bandwidth or power limitation , or both , according to the operating regimes ( i.e. , path - loss attenuation regimes ) .",
    "specifically , the network is bandwidth - limited as the path - loss attenuation is small .",
    "this is because network performance on the total throughput is roughly linear in the bandwidth .",
    "however , at the medium attenuation regime , the network is both bandwidth- and power - limited since the amount of available bandwidth and received signal power affects the performance .",
    "finally , the network becomes power - limited as the attenuation parameter increases exponentially with respect to more than @xmath25 , i.e. , at the high attenuation regime .",
    "hence , our results indicate that the upper bound for dense networks has three fundamentally different operating regimes according to the attenuation parameter .",
    "in addition , to show constructively our achievability result for extended networks , we describe the conventional nearest - neighbor mh transmission  @xcite , and analyze its achievable throughput .",
    "we show that under extended networks , the achievable rate scaling based on the mh routing exactly matches the upper bound on the capacity scaling for all the operating regimes .",
    "an achievability is also presented in dense networks by utilizing the existing mh routing scheme with a slight modification ",
    "we identify the operating regimes such that the optimal capacity scaling is guaranteed .",
    "therefore , this key result indicates that frequency scaling is instrumental towards achieving the order optimality in the regimes .",
    "furthermore , a random network scenario is discussed in this work .",
    "we show that under extended random networks , the conventional mh - based achievable scheme is not order - optimal for any operating regimes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : system ] describes our system and channel models . in section  [ sec : upper ] , the cut - set upper bounds on the throughput are derived . in section  [ sec : achievability ] , the achievable throughput scalings are analyzed .",
    "these results are extended to the random network case in section  [ sec : random ] .",

    "unless otherwise stated , all logarithms are assumed to be to the base 2 .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional underwater network that consists of @xmath0 nodes on a square such that two neighboring nodes are 1 and @xmath38 units of distance apart from each other in extended and dense networks , respectively , i.e. , a regular network  @xcite .",
    "we randomly pick a matching of s  d pairs , so that each node is the destination of exactly one source .",
    "each node has an average transmit power constraint @xmath39 ( constant ) , and we assume that the channel state information ( csi ) is available at all receivers , but not at the transmitters .",
    "it is assumed that each node transmits at a rate @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the total throughput of the network .",
    "now let us turn to channel modeling .",
    "we assume frequency - flat channel of bandwidth @xmath42 hz around carrier frequency @xmath43 , which satisfies @xmath44 , i.e. , narrow - band model .",
    "this is a highly simplified model , but nonetheless one that suffices to demonstrate the fundamental mechanisms that govern capacity scaling .",
    "assuming that all the nodes have perfectly directional transmissions , we also disregard multipath propagation , and simply focus on a line - of - sight channel between each pair of nodes used in  @xcite .",
    "an underwater acoustic channel is characterized by an attenuation that depends on both the distance @xmath45 between nodes @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and the signal frequency @xmath43 , and is given by @xmath49 for some constant @xmath50 independent of @xmath0 , where @xmath18 is the spreading factor and @xmath51 is the absorption coefficient  @xcite . for analytical tractability",
    ", we assume that the spreading factor @xmath18 does not change throughout the network , i.e. , that it is the same from short to long range transmissions , as in wireless radio networks  @xcite .",

    ", a wider range of both @xmath43 and @xmath0 is covered , similarly as in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider the case where the frequency scales at arbitrarily increasing rates relative to @xmath0 , which enables us to really capture the dependence on the frequency in performance",

    "we assume that @xmath63 is the circularly symmetric complex additive colored gaussian noise with zero mean and power spectral density ( psd ) @xmath65 , and thus the noise is frequency - dependent .",
    "the overall psd of four sources decays linearly on the logarithmic scale in the frequency region 100 hz",

    "is commonly used for the above approximation  @xcite . ]",
    "this means that @xmath69 since @xmath70 in terms of @xmath43 increasing with @xmath0 . from ( [ eq : aftheta ] ) and ( [ eq : nftheta ] )",
    ", we may then have the following relationship between the absorption @xmath58 and the noise psd @xmath65 : @xmath71    from the narrow - band assumption , the received signal @xmath72 at node @xmath73 at a given time instance is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 represents the complex channel between nodes @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath76 is the signal transmitted by node @xmath46 , and @xmath77 is the set of simultaneously transmitting nodes .",
    "the random phases @xmath78 are uniformly distributed over @xmath79 and independent for different @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and time .",

    "note that this random phase model is based on a far - field assumption  @xcite , of nodes . ] which is valid if the wavelength is sufficiently smaller than the minimum node separation .",
    "based on the above channel characteristics , operating regimes of the network are identified according to the following physical parameters : the absorption @xmath58 and the noise psd @xmath65 which are exploited here by choosing the frequency @xmath43 based on the number @xmath0 of nodes . in other words , if the relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath0 is specified , then @xmath58 and @xmath65 can be given by a certain scaling function of @xmath0 from ( [ eq : aftheta ] ) and ( [ eq : nftheta ] ) , respectively .",
    "to access the fundamental limits of an underwater network , new cut - set upper bounds on the total throughput scaling are analyzed from an information - theoretic perspective  @xcite .",

    "note , however , that the present problem is not equivalent to the conventional extended network framework  @xcite due to quite different channel characteristics , and the main result is shown here in a somewhat different way by providing a simpler derivation than that of  @xcite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut1 ] , let @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote the sets of sources and destinations , respectively , for the cut @xmath80 in an extended network .",

    "it is thus not possible to achieve a linear throughput scaling .",
    "now let us focus on the case where @xmath233 .",
    "at the top level of the hierarchy , the transmissions between two clusters having distance @xmath234 becomes a bottleneck because of the exponential path - loss attenuation with propagation distance .",
    "hence , the achievable throughput of the hc decays exponentially with respect to @xmath0 , which is significantly lower than that in ( [ eq : tndenselower ] ) .",
    "in this section , we would like to mention a random network configuration , where @xmath0 s  d pairs are uniformly and independently distributed on a square of unit node density ( i.e. , an extended random network ) .",
    "we first discuss an upper bound for extended random networks .",
    "a precise upper bound can be obtained using the binning argument of  @xcite ( refer to appendix v in  @xcite for the details ) .",
    "consider the same cut @xmath80 , which divides the network area into two halves , as in the regular network case . for analytical convenience",

    "let us state the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : nodenum ] assume a two dimensional extended network where @xmath0 nodes are uniformly distributed .",
    "when the network area is divided into @xmath0 squares of unit area , there are fewer than @xmath237 nodes in each square with high probability .",
    "since the result in lemma  [ lem : nodenum ] depends on the node distribution but not the channel characteristics , the proof essentially follows that presented in  @xcite . by lemma  [ lem : nodenum ]",
    ", we now take into account the network transformation resulting in a regular network with at most @xmath237 and @xmath238 nodes , on the left and right , respectively , at each square vertex except for the empty zone ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : displacement2 ] ) .",
    "then , the nodes in each square are moved together onto one vertex of the corresponding square .",
    "more specisely , under the cut @xmath80 , the node displacement is performed in the sense of decreasing the euclidean distance between source node @xmath101 and the corresponding destination @xmath109 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : displacement2 ] , which will provide an upper bound on @xmath146 in ( [ eq : pl ] ) .",
    "it is obviously seen that the amount of power transfer under the transformed regular network is greater than that under another regular network with at most @xmath237 nodes at each vertex , located at integer lattice positions in a square region of area @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the upper bound for random networks is boosted by at least a logarithmic factor of @xmath0 compared to that of regular networks discussed in section  [ sec : upper ] .",
    "now we turn our attention to showing an achievable throughput for extended random networks . in this case ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor mh protocol  @xcite can also be utilized since our network is highly power - limited .",
    "then , the area of each routing cell needs to scale with @xmath238 to guarantee at least one node in a cell  @xcite .. the distance in the draining and delivery phases , corresponding to the first and last hops of a packet transmission , respectively , is nevertheless given by some constant times @xmath237 , thereby limiting performance , especially for the condition @xmath239 .",
    "hence , using the routing protocol in  @xcite indeed does not perform better than the conventional mh case  @xcite in random networks . ]",
    "each routing cell operates based on 9-time division multiple access to avoid causing large interference to its neighboring cells  @xcite . for the mh routing , since per - hop distance is given by @xmath240 , the received signal power from the intended transmitter and the sinr seen by any receiver are expressed as @xmath241 and @xmath242 respectively , for some constants @xmath243 and @xmath244 independent of @xmath0 . since the number of hops per s ",

    "hence , using the mh protocol results in at least a polynomial decrease in the throughput compared to the regular network case shown in section  [ sec : achievability ] .",
    "this comes from the fact that the received signal power tends to be mainly limited due to exponential attenuation with transmission distance @xmath240 .",
    "note that in underwater networks , randomness on the node distribution causes a huge performance degradation on the throughput scaling .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the existing mh scheme does not satisfy the order optimality under extended random networks regardless of the attenuation parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the attenuation parameter and the capacity scaling laws have been characterized in a narrow - band channel of underwater acoustic networks .",
    "provided that the frequency @xmath43 scales relative to the number @xmath0 of nodes , the information - theoretic upper bounds and the achievable throughputs were obtained as functions of the attenuation parameter @xmath58 in regular networks . in extended networks , based on the power transfer argument , the upper bound was shown to decrease in inverse proportion to @xmath58 .",
    "in dense networks , the upper bound was derived characterizing three different operating regimes , in which there exists either a bandwidth or power limitation , or both .",
    "in addition , to show the achievability result , the nearest - neighbor mh protocol was introduced with a simple modification , and its throughput scaling was analyzed .",
    "we proved that the mh protocol is order - optimal in all operating regimes of extended networks and in power - limited regimes ( i.e. , the case where the frequency @xmath43 scales faster than or as @xmath249 ) of dense networks .",

    "<S> capacity scaling laws are analyzed in an underwater acoustic network with @xmath0 regularly located nodes on a square , in which both bandwidth and received signal power can be limited significantly . </S>",
    "<S> a narrow - band model is assumed where the carrier frequency is allowed to scale as a function of @xmath0 . in the network </S>",
    "<S> , we characterize an attenuation parameter that depends on the frequency scaling as well as the transmission distance . </S>",
    "<S> cut - set upper bounds on the throughput scaling are then derived in both extended and dense networks having unit node density and unit area , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is first analyzed that under extended networks , the upper bound is inversely proportional to the attenuation parameter , thus resulting in a highly power - limited network . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it is seen that the upper bound for extended networks is intrinsically related to the attenuation parameter but not the spreading factor . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in dense networks , we show that there exists either a bandwidth or power limitation , or both , according to the path - loss attenuation regimes , thus yielding the upper bound that has three fundamentally different operating regimes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we describe an achievable scheme based on the simple nearest - neighbor multi - hop ( mh ) transmission . </S>",
    "<S> we show that under extended networks , the mh scheme is order - optimal for all the operating regimes . </S>",
    "<S> an achievability result is also presented in dense networks , where the operating regimes that guarantee the order optimality are identified . </S>",
    "<S> it thus turns out that frequency scaling is instrumental towards achieving the order optimality in the regimes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , these scaling results are extended to a random network realization . as a result , vital information for fundamental limits of a variety of underwater network scenarios is provided by showing capacity scaling laws .    </S>",
