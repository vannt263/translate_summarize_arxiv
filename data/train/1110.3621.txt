    "the random flights have been introduced for describing the real motions with finite speed .",
    "the original formulation of the random flight problem is due to pearson , which considers a random walk with fixed and constant steps .",
    "indeed , the pearson s model deals with a random walker moving in the plane in straight lines with fixed length and turning through any angle whatever .",
    "the main object of interest is the position reached by the random walker after a fixed number of the steps .    over the years",
    "many researchers have proposed generalizations of the previous pearson s walk randomizing the spatial displacements . in particular , the random flights have been analyzed independently by several authors starting from the same two main assumptions .",
    "the first one concerns the directions which are supposed uniformly distributed on the sphere .",
    "furthermore , the length of the intervals between two consecutive changes of direction is an exponential random variable .",
    "therefore , there exists an underlying homogeneous poisson process governing the changes of direction .",
    "the reader can consult , for instance , stadje ( 1987 ) , masoliver _",
    "et al_. ( 1993 ) , franceschetti ( 2007 ) , orsingher and de gregorio ( 2007 ) , garcia - pelayo ( 2008 ) .",
    "a planar random flight with random time has also been studied in beghin and orsingher ( 2009 ) .",
    "exponential times are not the best choice for many important applications in physics , biology , and engineering , since they assign high probability mass to short intervals .",
    "for this reason , recently , the random flight problem has been tackled modifying the assumption on the exponential intertimes .",
    "for example , beghin and orsingher ( 2010 ) introduced a random motion which changes direction at even - valued poisson events .",
    "in other words this model assumes that the time between successive deviations is a gamma random variable .",
    "it can also be interpreted as the motion of particles that can hazardously collide with obstacles of different size , some of which are capable of deviating the motion . very recently , multidimensional random walks with gamma intertimes have been also taken into account by le car ( 2011 ) and pogorui and rodriguez - dagnino ( 2011 ) . le car ( 2010 ) and de gregorio and orsingher ( 2011 ) , considered the joint distribution of the time displacements as dirichlet random variables with parameters depending on the space in which the walker performs its motion . by means of the dirichlet law we are able to assign higher probability to time displacement with intermediate length .",
    "the dirichlet density function in somehow generalizes the uniform law and permits to explicit for each space the exact distribution of the position reached by the motion at time @xmath10 .    in the cited papers",
    ", it is assumed that the directions are uniformly distributed on the sphere .",
    "this last assumption is not completely appropriate .",
    "indeed , the real motions are persistent and tend to move along the same direction .",
    "therefore , it seems not exactly realistic to have the same probability to move along each direction of the space when the motion chooses a new orientation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze a spherically asymmetric random motion in @xmath5 , that is with non - uniformly distributed directions .",
    "essentially , the literature is devoted to analyze random walks with uniform distribution , while on the random flights with non - uniform distributed angles few references exist : see for instance grosjean ( 1953 ) and barber ( 1993 ) . for this reason we believe that this topic is interesting and merits further investigation .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we point out that other multidimensional random models with finite velocity , different from the random flights , have been proposed in literature : see , for example , orsingher ( 2000 ) , samoilenko ( 2001 ) , di crescenzo ( 2002 ) , lachal ( 2006 ) and lachal _",
    "et al_. ( 2006 ) .",
    "we describe the random flight model analyzed in this paper .",
    "let us consider a particle which starts from the origin of @xmath11 , and performs its motion with a constant velocity @xmath12 .",
    "hereafter , we assume that in the time interval @xmath13 $ ] , a number @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , of changes of direction of the motion is recorded .",
    "we suppose that the instants at which the random walker changes direction are @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , and denote the length of time separating these instants by @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the directions of the particle are represented by the points on the surface of the @xmath23-dimensional hypersphere with radius one .",
    "we assume that the random vector @xmath24 , representing the orientation of the particle , has density function given by     with @xmath25 $ ] . on the right",
    "it is depicted the density @xmath26 with @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28$].,scaledwidth=100.0% ]        [ plotpath ]    @xmath29    with @xmath30,j=1,2, ... ,d-2,$ ] @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the particle chooses the direction not uniformly on the sphere , but following an asymmetric density law .",
    "furthermore , the particle chooses a new direction independently from the previous one . in figure [ plotdens2 ]",
    "we have depicted the behavior of for @xmath8 and @xmath32 . from the picture on the left we can observe that the function is bimodal and assigns high probability mass near the points @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "similar considerations hold for the picture related to @xmath35 .",
    "clearly when @xmath7 increases the function @xmath36 tends to concentrate around the points @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "for @xmath37 we obtain the uniform distribution over the @xmath23-dimensional hypersphere , that is @xmath38 another important assumption is the following : the vector @xmath39 has distribution given by @xmath40 which represents a rescaled dirichlet random variable , with parameters @xmath41 .",
    "let us denote with @xmath0 the process representing the position reached , at time @xmath10 , by the particle following the random rules above described . in the rest of the paper we are going to analyze",
    "the random flights defined by @xmath0 and their probabilistic characteristics represent the main object of our analysis .",
    "recalling that the motion develops at constant velocity @xmath42 , and exploiting the hyperspherical coordinates , the @xmath23-dimensional random flight @xmath43 has components equal to @xmath44    the probability distribution of random flight @xmath0 is concentrated inside the @xmath23-dimensional hypersphere with radius @xmath45 , which we will indicate by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 represents the euclidean norm .",
    "the density law leads to a drift effect in the random motion .",
    "indeed , since the directions are not chosen with the same probability , the particle tends to move in some portions of the space @xmath5 with higher probability .",
    "clearly the parameter @xmath7 defines the degree of drift of the motion .",
    "therefore , if the value of @xmath7 increases , the particle will tend to move along the same part of the space .",
    "this behavior of the random motion seems to be consistent with the persistence of the real motions .",
    "the sample paths described by the moving particle having random position appear as straight lines with sharp turns and each steps are randomly oriented and with random length ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the drawbacks emerging in the study of the random flights defined in this paper are discussed in section 2 .",
    "therefore instead of studying directly @xmath0 we analyze its projections onto the lower space @xmath49 .",
    "this approach leads to another random motions for which we obtain the probability distributions .",
    "for @xmath8 , we provide the characteristic function for @xmath50 ( section 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , we infer a closed - form expression for the density function of the random flight with @xmath8 . for @xmath51 it",
    "is possible to explicit completely the above density function .",
    "the appendix contains results on the integrals involving bessel functions , which assume a crucial role in this paper .",
    "in order to study the process @xmath0 introduced in the previous section , we take into account the same approach developed in orsingher and de gregorio ( 2007 ) and de gregorio and orsingher ( 2011 ) .",
    "the first step consists in the calculation of the characteristic function of @xmath0 which plays a key role in our analysis .",
    "let us indicate by @xmath52 the scalar product , then we have that @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55    the integrals with respect to the @xmath56 angles @xmath57 are of the form @xmath58 which seems to have an explicit solution only for particular values of @xmath7 ( see appendix ) .",
    "thus the choice of the non - uniform family of distributions for the directions of the random motion , makes the analysis of the process , at least in its general setting , very complicated .",
    "clearly for @xmath37 we get the uniform case studied in the paper mentioned in the introduction .    for this reason , instead of studying directly @xmath59 , we deal with the random process @xmath60 namely the projection of @xmath59 onto the lower space @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , having components equal to @xmath63 the vector @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 ) appearing in , has distribution given by the marginal density of @xmath66 , that is @xmath67 therefore , @xmath68 can be interpreted as the shadow of in the lower spaces ( see for instance figure 2 ) . in other words , if we observe in @xmath61 the particle moving in @xmath69 according to the random rules of @xmath70 , we perceive a random flight with components having vector velocity @xmath71 with random intensity @xmath72 . then , in what follows we analyze the random motion @xmath73 with orientations distributed according to .",
    "our first result concerns the characteristic function of .",
    "[ teo1 ] the characteristic function of @xmath73 is equal to @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the bessel function .    the characteristic function of @xmath73 becomes @xmath76 with    @xmath77    since @xmath78 we observe that , after the integrations with respect to @xmath79 becomes @xmath80    we are able to perform all the @xmath81 integrations with respect to the angles @xmath82 by applying successively the formula in the appendix .",
    "the integration with respect to @xmath83 yields @xmath84    in the last step we applied formula for @xmath85@xmath86 and also considered that @xmath87    the integration with respect to the variables @xmath88 follows similarly by applying again and yields @xmath89    continuing in the same way we obtain that @xmath90    then we can write that @xmath91    in order to work out this @xmath14-fold integral , the result assumes a crucial role .",
    "indeed , we apply recursively the formula to calculate each integral with respect to the variables @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , in the first step we have that @xmath93    the second integral is given by @xmath94    then , the last integral becomes @xmath95 therefore , plugging the result into the expression , and by observing that @xmath96 and @xmath97 some manipulations lead to .",
    "let us denote by @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "now , by means of , we derive the explicit probability distribution of the random motion @xmath3 which is concentrated in the hypersphere @xmath100 .",
    "[ th2 ] the probability law of @xmath3 is equal to @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    by inverting the characteristic function , we are able to show that the density law of the process @xmath104 is given by . indeed , by passing to the hyperspherical coordinates",
    ", we have that @xmath105 in the first step above we have performed calculations similar to those leading to and then @xmath106 while in the last step we have used formula for @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    [ rem ] by taking into account",
    ", we observe that @xmath3 represents an isotropic random walk ; that is its probability distribution depends on the distance , from the origin , of the position of the random walker .",
    "furthermore , by setting @xmath37 in , we reobtain the result ( 2.26 ) in de gregorio and orsingher ( 2011 ) .",
    "the cumulative distribution function for the process @xmath3 is equal to @xmath111 with @xmath112 . if @xmath113 , we can write down @xmath114 in an alternative form involving a finite sum",
    "then , one has that @xmath115    by assuming that the number of steps @xmath56 is a random value , it is possible to get the unconditional distribution for @xmath116 . in other words , we suppose that the number @xmath14 of changes of direction are governed by a fractional poisson process @xmath117 introduced by orsingher and beghin ( 2009 ) .",
    "therefore , we have that @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the mittag - leffler function .",
    "furthermore @xmath117 is supposed independent from @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "then , in order to obtain the unconditional distribution of @xmath3 we can average with the distribution .",

    "therefore , let @xmath124 be the density function of @xmath125 , the result implies that @xmath126 furthermore , by taking into account , we derive the moments of @xmath127 that is @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "as observed in the previous section for a general value of @xmath7 , we are not able to work out the integral . nevertheless , it is possible to derive a closed - form expression for the characteristic function of @xmath130 for some values of @xmath7 .",
