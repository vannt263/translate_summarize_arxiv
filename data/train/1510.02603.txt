    "in recent years , a clear picture of the variation of electronic structure of cuprate high - tc materials with doping has emerged .",
    "overdoped materials have large hole - like cylindrical fermi surfaces with cross sections reflecting the single hole on a cu@xmath3 plus the additional carriers due to doping @xcite , whereas on the under - doped side of the superconducting dome , qo measurements @xcite indicated small electron - like fermi surface ( fs ) areas that occupy only @xmath4 2 % of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "this strongly suggested a fs reconstruction arising from broken translational symmetry @xcite .",
    "macroscopic measurements indicate a change to electron - like transport below @xmath4 150 k in the under - doped region @xcite , which is consistent with the fs reconstruction scenario , and nmr measurements on under - doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) @xcite give clear indications of charge density waves .",
    "the cdw state has been seen by x - ray diffraction in ybco @xcite .",
    "it has been shown to be a ubiquitous high - tc phenomenon @xcite , and there is strong evidence that the cdw order at high fields is intimately connected with the qo frequencies @xcite .",
    "in zero magnetic field , the cdw displacements break the mirror symmetry of the cuo@xmath0 bilayers @xcite . in high magnetic fields ,",
    "the cdw modulation along the crystal @xmath5-direction of an ybco sample develops long - range order @xcite .",
    "the relationship of the high - field structure to the zero - field structure @xcite has also been established @xcite and it also breaks the mirror symmetry of the cuo@xmath0 bilayers .",
    "hence we now have the essential ingredients to give an explanation of the qo results . unlike previous attempts , in our model we use the correct cdw symmetry , and choose our chemical potential to be consistent with the nodal fs recently seen by arpes .",
    "we assume weak @xmath6-axis tunnelling between bilayers in order to obtain the minimal model for the qo results .",
    "this approach reveals how much can be explained by a single - particle fermi liquid model , and raises some fascinating questions .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the fermi surface reconstruction of a single bilayer in which both * a * and * b * modulations are present in the same region of the sample .",
    "this coexistence is consistent with ultrasonic measurements on an underdoped ybco sample @xcite and the close - to - fourfold symmetry of the qo results @xcite .",
    "recent zero - field x - ray measurements @xcite have shown that both the cdws have a previously unsuspected symmetry , which gives opposite perturbations in the two halves of the superconducting cuo@xmath0 bilayers .",
    "x - ray measurements also show @xcite that this symmetry is maintained at high magnetic fields @xmath7  t , i.e. above the phase transition observed by ultrasound and nmr for fields b @xmath415 - 17 t. however , x - ray measurements @xcite indicate a very short @xmath6-axis correlation length for the cdw modulated along * a * , yet clear qo signals are observed in what is a somewhat disordered state .",
    "thus we believe that it is reasonable to consider a single bilayer occasioned by weak @xmath6-axis tunnelling between separate bilayers , which will be little affected by incomplete ordering along the @xmath6-axis .    there is a hierarchy of electronic energy scales in this system , and we list the ones of relevance for this problem . the largest is the coulomb energy , which ensures a mott insulating state at zero doping .",
    "the next largest is the basal plane hopping , which gives the shape and the effective mass of the unreconstructed fermi surface .",
    "there are then several effects which are of similar order of magnitude , and which we list in order of expected decreasing size : @xmath6-axis tunnelling between the two halves of a single cuo@xmath0 bilayer , pseudogap energy ( which we shall include only qualitatively ) and the cdw perturbation .",
    "the energy of the carriers due to the applied magnetic field must also be included : in a typical field of 50  t used in qo measurements , the zeeman energy of the spins is @xmath83 mev , and the splitting of the ` orbital ' landau levels is similar .",
    "we expect that the spin - orbit interaction will be comparable in magnitude with this .",
    "finally we have the @xmath6-axis tunnelling between separate bilayers , and we shall set this to zero in our model .    in fig .",
    "1 we give a general outline of how the fs reconstruction arises from the cdw structures now established . the cdw perturbation can give strong hybridisation between states at the same energy which are connected by the cdw @xmath9-vectors .",
    "the relevant states may be visualised by translating fermi surfaces by these @xmath9-vectors into a corner of the bz - as illustrated in fig .  1 . because the cdw gives opposite perturbations in the two halves of a bilayer , the strongest hybridisation takes place between the bonding ( @xmath10 ) and antibonding ( @xmath11 ) states of a bilayer , giving the avoided crossings at the points marked in black .",
    "however , weaker hybridisation can also take place at @xmath12 and @xmath13 crossings marked in red .",
    "this gives rise to two reconstructed fss : the smaller one is of mainly @xmath11 character and the larger is mainly constructed from the @xmath10 bands . in high fields ,",
    "the smaller gaps may be bridged by magnetic breakdown , giving several different fs areas , as observed in experiment .",
    "parts of this general scenario have been invoked before @xcite , but none of these models used the correct form for the cdw perturbation , the tunnelling between the two halves of the bilayer , and the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling at the fs crossing points .",
    "bilayer electron states . in ( a )",
    "are represented the fs sheets arising from the antibonding ( @xmath11 ) and bonding ( @xmath10 - dashed line ) bands of the cuo@xmath0 bilayers in a @xmath14 cross - section of the bz for ybco .",

    "these are associated with the ` pseudogap ' ( pg ) which corresponds to the removal of states at the fermi level , leaving ` fermi arcs ' instead of complete fermi surfaces .",
    "these have been observed in underdoped ybco by photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "the states removed by the pg are at the edges of figure 1 and do not participate in the formation of the small electron - like pockets .",
    "it is also found @xcite that the states in the cuo chains are suppressed .",
    "qo observations in ybco as a function of underdoping confirm this effect , as they give no indications of a chain fs ( nor effects of chain - ordering ) , and heat capacity measurements at high field @xcite also show that the chains are not metallic .",
    "these results indicate that first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations are not sufficiently accurate in the underdoped region , since they give a chain fermi surface , and certainly do not give the pg .    instead , to obtain tractable results , we carry out our calculations using a tight - binding approximation ( tba ) for the band structure of a single cuo@xmath0 bilayer , which can be used to give the shapes of the fermi arcs , which are coupled by the cdw .",
    "this approach lays bare the essential physics , because the symmetry of the band couplings caused by the cdw perturbations will be unaffected by the pg . in our two - dimensional model , we can ignore @xmath19 - the @xmath6-axis component of the carrier wavevector , but our results can be extended @xcite to take account of @xmath6-axis coherence revealed by transport measurements @xcite .",
    "we first recount the properties of the bilayer states in the absence of a cdw .",
    "we then show how the hybridisation of bilayer states by a cdw varies with their bonding or antibonding character , the bilayer coupling , and the presence of spin - orbit splitting .",
    "we use the results of dft calculations to indicate general features of bilayer coupling in the tba approach , and reveal some misconceptions in the literature about this .",
    "we show results of our calculations for a set of parameters chosen to reveal the important features of the model that can give an account of features of the qo observations .",
    "we estimate the effects of magnetic breakdown across the cdw band - gaps and show that this will be important .",
    "finally we discuss to what extent this scenario can account for the experimental observations .",
    "until now it had been assumed that a cdw in ybco would have even symmetry about the centre of the bilayer and would only couple @xmath11 to @xmath11 and @xmath10 to @xmath10 bands @xcite .",
    "however , structure determinations show that the cdw perturbation has odd symmetry , at both zero and high fields @xcite .",
    "this perturbation may arise from cdw - associated changes in basal plane tunnelling , local doping or coulomb potential , and all of these have opposite values in the two halves of a bilayer . in an isolated bilayer , the @xmath11 and @xmath10 states",
    "are usually assumed to have a definite parity so that the cdw perturbation couples only @xmath11 to @xmath10 .",
    "however , two effects negate this simple picture and allow weak hybridisation of @xmath11 with @xmath11 states and @xmath10 with @xmath10 .",
    "firstly , a rashba - type spin - orbit interaction @xcite gives an opposite energy shift to states of a given spin in the top and bottom layers .",
    "the importance of this interaction , and the fact that it can flip carrier spin has recently been emphasised @xcite .",
    "secondly , if coupling between adjacent bilayers can not be ignored , the @xmath11 and @xmath10 states do not have a definite parity at general @xmath19 . in the present paper",
    ", we shall assume that this second effect can be neglected and consider this generalisation in a further publication @xcite .",
    "to set the scene , we sketch the tba for the double fermi surface sheets arising from the cuo@xmath0 bilayer bands , ignoring the spin - orbit interaction for now . as described above , we also ignore the chain bands and for simplicity treat the ybco cell as tetragonal with lattice parameters @xmath20 and @xmath6 . in the absence of bilayer coupling , the energy @xmath21 of a state relative to the fermi energy @xmath22 in a single cuo@xmath0 layer with basal plane wavevector @xmath23",
    "is given by ref .",
    ": @xmath24 typical ratios for the tunnelling matrix elements are : @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite , and the value of @xmath22 is chosen to give an almost half - filled bz .",
    "this @xmath21 is then modified by the intra - bilayer tunnelling @xmath27 and the coupling @xmath28 of two adjacent bilayers in the @xmath6-direction to give the two bilayer bands - bonding - of lower energy , and antibonding .",
    "we expect that @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and also the cdw perturbation @xmath31 will be of similar magnitude : in the region of 10 mev @xcite . the bilayer energies and states in the absence of the cdw",
    "are given by a hamiltonian matrix using the basis states on each half of a bilayer @xcite : @xmath32 the energy eigenvalues of this are : @xmath33 assuming that @xmath28 is negligible , this reduces to @xmath34 , where the @xmath35 ambiguity refers to the @xmath11 and @xmath10 bands respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath6-axis dispersion is removed if either of @xmath27 and @xmath28 is zero , but the @xmath18 splitting remains as long as at least one of them is nonzero .",
    "we now introduce the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction ; there are several possible terms , but the important one for our purposes breaks the symmetry between the two halves of the bilayer for a state of given spin , and hence allows hybridisation by the cdw at crossings between bilayer states of like character .",
    "it arises because an individual cuo@xmath0 layer does not have mirror symmetry in the @xmath36-direction , so the states in each layer have a rashba - type energy term @xcite : @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the spin operator and @xmath39 gives the strength of this effect ; in the original nearly - free electron case @xcite , @xmath40 would be proportional to the carrier momentum .",
    "for our purposes , a sufficiently good approximation is instead to take @xmath40 relative to the nearest corner of the bz , since the unreconstructed energy bands form approximately circular energy contours around these points .",
    "the sign of the term is opposite in the top and bottom layers .",
    "the rashba term only involves @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which can be expressed in terms of eigenstates of @xmath43 using the pauli spin matrices .",
    "we can write the hamiltonian matrix including this term by using the layer states labeled by the @xmath36-component of their spin , giving :    @xmath44    here , the first two basis states are in the upper half of the bilayer and have up and down spins with zeeman energy @xmath45 in an applied field @xmath46 ; these states are coupled by the so interaction .",
    "the other two basis states are in the lower half of the bilayer and have an so interaction which is opposite in sign to that for the top layer .",
    "the ( spin - independent ) tunnelling terms connect states of the same spin in top and bottom layers , while the spin - orbit terms connect states of opposite spin in the same layer . in zero field , this hamiltonian gives the @xmath11 and @xmath10 state energies , each of which is doubly ( kramers ) degenerate due to the overall mirror symmetry of the bilayer : @xmath47 comparison with eqn .",
    "( 3 ) shows that the spin - orbit term does not mix the @xmath11 and @xmath10 bands ; it merely increases the @xmath18 energy splitting . in nonzero field",
    ", there are four different eigenvalues , which for @xmath48 may be labelled approximately as spin up and down in the @xmath11 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "finally , we introduce the cdw perturbation @xmath31 . to first order",
    ", it only connects states in the same layer ( and of the same spin ) that differ by a single cdw @xmath9-vector @xcite .",
    "the antisymmetry of this perturbation means that its matrix element between basis states in the upper layer is equal and opposite to that for the lower half of the bilayer , and we may write the values as @xmath49 respectively . hence , to describe the hybridisation between two sets of @xmath11 and @xmath10 bands , we have the 8 @xmath50 8 hamiltonian matrix given in eq .   ( 7 ) .",
    "( we refrain from reproducing the 16 @xmath50 16 matrix , which is the minimal model to represent all four crossings shown in fig .  1 .",
    ") in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , the two 4 @xmath50 4 blocks on the diagonal reproduce eq .",
    "( 5 ) for the two sets of states connected by a cdw , while the off - diagonal blocks represent the cdw couplings between them .",
    "the basal plane wavevector @xmath51 or @xmath52 for hybridisation by an @xmath20- or @xmath5-direction cdw . for simplicity",
    ", we take the cdw matrix element @xmath31 to have the same value for the @xmath20 and @xmath5 cdw modulations .    @xmath53",
    "the quantity @xmath27 arises from tunnelling between the two halves of a bilayer .",
    "it has been stated e.g.  in refs .   that @xmath27 has a strong dependence on @xmath40 , and is zero on the nodal line @xmath54 , but this is not the case . if @xmath27 were indeed zero at the nodal line , eqn .",
    "( 3 ) indicates that there would be zero @xmath19 dispersion on this line , whereas dft calculations @xcite show a nonzero dispersion .",
    "in adducing evidence from dft calculations , we do not rely on their absolute accuracy , merely that if they give finite @xmath19 dispersion , then they show that zero dispersion is _ not _ imposed by crystal symmetry .",
    "the origin of the supposed zero of @xmath27 is the assumption that the tunnelling between the two halves of the bilayer takes place at the cu ions , via orbitals of @xmath55 ( or equivalently @xmath56 ) symmetry @xcite . our own band structure calculations , using the method of ref .",
    "show that the tunnelling is dominated by paths via the o-@xmath57 - cu-@xmath58 conduction band orbitals , because the large o@xmath59 ions give a noticeable electron density towards the centre of the bilayer .",
    "this main o - cu tunnelling path is directly in the @xmath6-direction , between equivalent lobes of wavefunctions on cu and o , so there is little @xmath40-dependence of @xmath27 - the _",
    "intra_-bilayer tunnelling , and we shall take @xmath27 as a constant",
    ".    however , the main tunnelling path for the inter - bilayer tunnelling @xmath28 is via a @xmath60-orbital on the apical oxygen . in a tetragonal cuprate",
    ", this would lead , for identical reasons , to the expression that has been claimed for @xmath27 : @xmath61 this would lead to @xmath62 and again to zero dispersion with @xmath19 on the nodal line , for a tetragonal superconductor , but this result is not exact in orthorhombic ybco @xcite and is not seen in dft calculations . nevertheless , the multiple hops for this path , and the effects leading to eqn .",
    "( 8) suggest that @xmath28 will be much smaller than @xmath27 near the nodal region , and hence at the crossing points where fs reconstruction can occur .",
    "these are the reasons for taking @xmath62 in our modelling .",
    "we are now in a position to illustrate , by explicit numerical calculations , how various physical effects contribute to the fs reconstruction by the cdws . in our calculations , we take a double-@xmath9 cdw , with incommensurate @xmath63-values , which for simplicity we set to 0.32 for both components , and take @xmath63 as independent of field  @xcite .",
    "we take the value @xmath64 for @xmath27 .",
    "this value is chosen for clarity to give well - separated @xmath11 and @xmath10 bands ; smaller values may be needed to fit the experimental qo frequency splittings , and to be consistent with arpes observations @xcite that do not resolve the @xmath18 separation along the nodal direction .",
    "for the perturbation due to the cdw we take @xmath65 , giving it a value comparable with the quantity determining the @xmath18 splitting . for the so interaction ,",
    "we take a value for @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) of @xmath66 .",
    "this was chosen to be sufficiently large to make the so hybridisation gaps easily visible .",
    "we have expressed all energy variables in terms of @xmath67 , so that our calculations of fs areas are independent of the value of @xmath67 , which then determines the effective masses associated with these areas .",
    "the combination of the cdw @xmath63-values and the positions of the unperturbed fermi surfaces determine the areas of the reconstructed electron pockets .",
    "the value of @xmath22 was chosen to give pocket areas which are close to the 2% of the bz given by qo measurements .",
    "this implies fermi arcs which are close to the antiferromagnetic bz boundaries .",
    "this is consistent with arpes observations in underdoped ybco @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the effects of underdoping or pg may reduce the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 below those of ref .  .",
    "a reduction by a factor of 2 would give positions of the fermi arcs in agreement with experiment . a simplistic picture ignoring the pg and constructing an unperturbed fs shape containing @xmath4 1.1 holes",
    "( doping @xmath68 0.1 ) and @xmath69 0.32 would give fs pockets considerably smaller than those observed .",
    "typical results of numerical diagonalization of the full 16 @xmath5016 hamiltonian matrix , calculated at zero @xmath46 are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in ( a , c ) we give the fs shapes in the absence of the cdw , to make it clear in ( b , d ) which states are mixed by the cdws . in ( b )",
    "we see a smaller fs sheet that is @xmath11 in character plus a larger one that is mainly @xmath10 in character ; however ( d ) shows that the @xmath70 splitting , which gives the smaller fs in ( b ) , only arises because of the weak so interaction . without it ,",
    "we would obtain intersecting fermi surfaces like those depicted in fig . 1 ( e ) , ( f ) .",

    "the zeeman energy of the electron spins at the fields used for qo measurements is substantial .",
    "it is comparable to the landau level spacing and there are only @xmath4 10 landau levels below the fermi level in the small electron pockets . in fig .",
    "3 we show that in addition , the effects of magnetic field along the @xmath6-direction are non - trivial . fig 3 ( a ) shows the effects of the zeeman energy ( set to a value @xmath71 ) on the bands in the absence of hybridisation , with an expanded view at a single crossing in ( b ) .",
    "the effects of the cdws are shown in ( c ) ( d ) .",
    "the spin - split fermi surfaces are labelled with arrows representing the spin directions .",
    "two interesting effects are revealed in ( c ) ( d ) .",
    "it will be noticed that there are places where fermi surfaces cross each other without any splitting . at the high magnetic fields employed for qo measurements ,",
    "it is likely that any residual gaps in these regions due to higher order effects will be ineffective and the electron orbits will tend to pass pass through them .",
    "another very important qualitative feature of the so interaction is revealed by tracing the spin directions from regions well away from the crossing region .",
    "we find in those places where the so interaction enables an avoided crossing , that the carrier spin direction is flipped as well . as emphasised in ref .",
    ", a carrier going around an orbit with spin flip can show an anomalously small average zeeman energy or @xmath72-factor .",
    "in all the orbits shown in fig 3 ( c ) , there is an even number of spin flips , so the carriers should have close to zero average zeeman energy .",
    "however , this conclusion is modified if the electron orbits can pass by ` magnetic breakdown ' through the so gap or other small gaps .",
    "this process can alter both the areas of the orbits and the spin energy , so we now consider it .",
    "the representation of the motion of a carrier in a lattice in a magnetic field by the progress of its @xmath40-vector around a fermi surface is an approximation .",
    "if the carrier comes to a small ` forbidden ' region created by an energy gap , it is possible for the particle to ` tunnel ' through the forbidden region , particularly at high magnetic fields .",
    "this is called magnetic breakdown .",
    "if two fs sheets approach each other but have a gap between them in @xmath40-space of value @xmath73 , then the probability @xmath74 of tunneling across the gap is given by @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the magnetic length in a field @xmath46 , defined by @xmath77 .",
    "for the case considered here , the important process is magnetic breakdown from @xmath11 to @xmath11 or @xmath10 to @xmath10 at the red crossing points in fig . 1 .",
    "( we propose that breakdown out of the fermi arcs towards the edges of the bz is prevented by the pg . ) assuming that the cdw gaps are comparable with those due to @xmath18 splitting , we may use the qo data to give an order of magnitude for the gap @xmath73 between different fs areas , and this will indicate ( independent of our calculations above ) at what fields magnetic breakdown may be important .",
    "the qo frequencies in ybco are around 2% of the bz area , i.e.  @xmath78 and the spread of frequencies is @xmath79 , giving a gap @xmath73 between the corners of two concentric areas @xmath80 .",
    "now we may write the probability of magnetic breakdown in the form : @xmath81 using our rough estimate , of @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath82 40 t , which is in the range where qo measurements are carried out , and suggests that magnetic breakdown may well be dominant at the highest fields . indeed , according to our calculations , the hybridisation gaps between bands of like character have small",
    "so values at the crossing points .",
    "hence , magnetic breakdown will play an important role even at lower fields , and it will give a high probability that the @xmath83-vectors of the carriers pass straight through these crossings .",
    "an important experimental variable in qo measurements is to change the direction of the applied field . in two - dimensional materials ,",
    "this allows the comparison of the zeeman and landau level spacings , which have a different dependence on angle and can lead to ` spin zeroes ' in the qo signal for particular angles between * b * and the * c*-axis @xcite .",
    "there is a further effect of tilting the magnetic field : @xmath84 in the expression for magnetic breakdown becomes @xmath85 , when the field is tilted by an angle @xmath86 from * c * , so the probability of magnetic breakdown is decreased . in the present case , there is an additional interest : the so - term in eqn .",
    "4 behaves like a magnetic field in the basal plane , parallel to the unreconstructed fermi surface and of opposite sign in the two halves of a bilayer .",
    "this can interfere with a real magnetic field , which when tilted gives a basal plane component equal in the two halves of a bilayer .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the effect of _ field angle _ only ; we have neglected the weak variation with angle of the electronic @xmath72-factor ( also a so effect ) , because it does not give rise to qualitatively new behaviour .",
    "it will be seen in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) ( b ) that a field tilted towards the @xmath87-direction removes the so spin flips for the crossings in the @xmath88 direction and replaces them with small gaps , but the spin - flips remain for the @xmath89 crossings .",
    "this is confirmed by fig .",

    "these gaps arise when the sum of the basal plane applied field and so effective field further breaks the bilayer symmetry , so that more cdw hybridisation matrix elements become nonzero .",
    "thus , tilting the magnetic field will introduce a fourfold anisotropy in the values of the gaps and hence in the connectivity of the electron orbits .",

    "( c ) the shaded areas are the two orbits of medium area , which would represent the central peak in a typical qo spectrum .",
    "this peak is dominant in the experimental data , and is also known to have an electron @xmath72-factor close to the standard value @xcite . in our model , these orbits have no spin flips , which agrees with the observed @xmath72-factor value .",
    "these orbits arise only because of magnetic breakdown , so we deduce that the gaps at the red points are small .",
    "in ( d ) - ( i ) , we represent the other possible orbits allowed by the model . in ( d ) ( e ) are represented two different orbits of identical area but different orientations ; in later panels , we give only the topology , not all possible orientations .",
    "the spin flips are represented by using a black dashed line for paths with one spin orientation and a red one for the other .",
    "it will be noted that in orbits ( d ) to ( i ) there is some cancellation of the electron spin direction .",
    "this is a phenomenon pointed out by ref . and gives a reduced effective @xmath72-factor , and less dependence of orbit area on the value of magnetic field .",
    "it is found experimentally that some of the qo sidebands have different spin zero positions from the main frequency .",
    "this is an expected consequence of our model .",
    "there are in fact three orbits , ( f ) , ( g ) and ( i ) which have a @xmath72-factor close to zero and ( i ) has an area similar to ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "when magnetic breakdown is strong , we expect that orbits with many reflections , ( f ) and ( g ) , will have low weight .    these are the predictions of the model for * b * parallel to * c*. as shown earlier , tilting the field away from * c * will not only increase the probability of reflection at some of the red crossing points , it can also replace spin - flips with energy gaps at various places , depending on the azimuthal angle of the tilt relative to the * a * , * b * crystal axes . in particular , we find that orbits ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "5 acquire additional gaps , which can alter the probability of transmission or change the spin energy on reflection .",
    "this , and similar effects on the orbits of type ( i ) , which have the same area , could account for the reported fourfold azimuthal dependendence of the qo signal which may arise from these orbits @xcite .",
    "our model clearly predicts a wealth of different effects and gives a scenario capable of accounting for the multiple pocket areas given by qo measurements , although a detailed fit of the extensive existing data @xcite is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the model we have described gives a coherent account of the influence of the cdw on the qo spectra observed in underdoped ybco .",
    "we have ignored all effects of the cuo chains , since they appear to be non - metallic in the underdoped region , and the different orderings of the occupied chains at different dopings appears to have no effect on the smooth variation of qo frequency with doping @xcite .",
    "we have relied on the pseudogap and underdoping to remove chain and antinodal carrier states which do not appear in qo , hall , and heat capacity measurements at high field @xcite , and leave the ` fermi arc ' states which are hybridised by the cdws .",
    "recent qo measurements @xcite have suggested the existence of an additional hole - like area , approximately @xmath92 of those discussed here , and it was proposed @xcite that the pseudogap can also explain this result , which does not come out of our calculations .",
    "however , it seems likely that these experimental results arise either from mixing of qo frequencies , which can arise in two - dimensional materials from chemical potential oscillations @xcite or ` stark interference ' @xcite corresponding to effects on transport properties of the difference between two areas traversed by electrons @xcite .    a notable feature of the cdw state in ybco - and in other materials - is that the @xmath9-vector of the cdw appears not to be a nesting vector between two parallel sheets of fermi surface .",
    "it is clear that the nesting argument , which is persuasive in 1-d does not necessarily apply in 2- and 3-d .",
    "the question then remains : what is the driving force for the cdw , and what determines its @xmath9-vectors ?",
    "the picture we have of fs reconstruction in ybco should also be tested against the field - dependence of the hall effect @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the positive and negative curvatures of the reconstructed pockets give rise to a field - dependence of the hall effect , with a large value and electron - like sign at high fields .",
    "the _ magnitude _ of the high - field hall coefficient is simply related to the number of carriers , and two pockets each occupying @xmath4 2% of the bz would give a value @xmath93 mm@xmath94/c .",
    "earlier data @xcite gave a value much larger than this , corresponding more closely to a single electron pocket rather than the two we obtain from calculation . however , more recent data from the same group @xcite is in good agreement with expectations .",
    "we have used arpes measurements to indicate those portions of the fermi surface which remain after the effects of the pseudogap and therefore can be reconstructed by the cdw . however , although cdws exist in zero magnetic field , there have been no reports of a reconstructed fs observed by arpes .",
    "qo measurements are a bulk effect , and it is possible that the immediate surface - to which arpes is sensitive - does not support a strong enough cdw .",
    "it is also possible that the pocket signal is too weak in arpes or would only appear at high fields where qo measurements are performed and arpes measurements are impossible .",
    "in conclusion we have demonstrated how multiple qo frequencies observed in ybco are naturally explained by the odd symmetry of the cdw order , combined with the effects of spin - orbit interaction and magnetic breakdown . our minimal model for an isolated bilayer",
    "gives an account of the main features expected for the reconstructed part of the fermi surface in underdoped ybco and leads to a rich phenomenology .",
    "our calculations have been carried out for reasonable values of the parameters to illustrate the effects that are produced in the published quantum oscillation data , including the fourfold anisotropy present when the field is tilted away from the @xmath6-axis .",
    "it is interesting that the tilted field not only investigates the electronic structure which was present with field perpendicular to the bilayers , but also modifies it .",
    "it remains for detailed fits , which will need to include the effects of magnetic breakdown , giving a field - dependence to the amplitudes of the various qo frequencies , to establish whether the role of the cdw in fermi surface reconstruction in ybco can be fully established .",
