    "in the de broglie - bohm causal interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite , as opposed to the standard `` copenhagen '' interpretation , particles are endowed with well - defined trajectories @xmath3 that are determined by the wavefunction @xmath4 of the quantum system being studied . a compatability with the statistical results of quantum mechanics",
    "is achieved by assigning an uncertainty in the initial conditions of the particles according to the probability density function @xmath5 .",
    "the causal interpretation continues to receive attention as a way of addressing the question of the incompleteness of standard quantum mechanics ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , however , causal trajectories have been playing a more significant role in practical calculations of chemical physics and quantum chemistry , for example ( to name only a few references ) , quantum tunnelling dynamics @xcite , nonadiabatic transitions @xcite , reactive scattering @xcite , dissociation dynamics @xcite and hybrid classical / quantum schemes to study complex systems @xcite .",
    "bohm himself @xcite introduced the idea of studying transitions in terms of the causal interpretation , examining the franck - hertz experiment and the photoelectric and compton effects .",
    "he attempted to show that the seemingly discontinuous and poorly defined transfers of energy and momentum in transitions could be accounted for in a continuous matter by means of the `` quantum potential '' that arises in the causal formalism . more recently in this vein , dewdney and lam @xcite studied transitions of ( spinless ) particles in a one - dimensional infinite square well potential . in this paper",
    "we employ the de broglie - bohm deterministic approach to study the problem of a @xmath0-@xmath6 electronic transition in hydrogen induced by an oscillating ( semiclassical ) electromagnetic field , taking the spin of the electron into account .",
    "it is instructive to review briefly the main ideas of the causal interpretation .",
    "first , the wavefunction @xmath7 for a particle is written in the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real - valued .",
    "substitution of eq . into the time - dependent schrdinger equation ,",
    "@xmath11 yields the following coupled equations in @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is called the _",
    "quantum potential_. eq .",
    "is the standard continuity equation of quantum mechanics .",
    "it can be viewed as governing the evolution of a compressible , irrotational fluid with density @xmath15 and velocity @xmath16 as , indeed , was done by madelung @xcite .",
    "eq . has the same form as the classical hamilton - jacobi equation for a particle that moves under the influence of potentials @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "bohm s unique interpretation of these equations was that the particle has a well - defined trajectory defined by the _ quantum equation of motion _ @xmath19 as stated earlier , compatability with standard quantum mechanics is achieved by viewing the initial conditions of trajectories as `` hidden variables '' with associated uncertainties as described by the probability distribution @xmath20 .",
    "recall that the schrdinger current * j * associated with the wavefunction @xmath7 is given by @xcite @xmath21 .\\ ] ] a comparison of eqs . and shows that @xmath22    the momentum defined in eq . is not unique in generating the same statistical predictions as quantum mechanics .",
    "holland @xcite has shown that eqs . and apply only to spinless particles . for particles with spin ,",
    "an additional term is necessary in order that the schrdinger equation of motion be consistent with a relativistic formulation .",
    "the condition of lorentz invariance implies that the momentum of a particle with spin * s * , even in the non - relativistic limit , must be given by @xmath23 the associated current @xmath24 has been referred to as the _ pauli current _ , the nonrelativistic limit of the _ dirac current _ , as opposed to eq . which is the nonrelativistic limit of the _ gordon current _ @xcite .",
    "consistency with dirac theory requires that the schrdinger equation be regarded as describing an electron in an eigenstate of spin @xcite .",
    "as regards the causal interpretation , the spin - dependent term was also discussed in @xcite but only for the pauli equation and not the schrdinger equation .    in the case of a hydrogen atom",
    ", the momentum equation predicts that an electron in any real eigenstate will be stationary since @xmath25 .",
    "this counterintuitive result no longer applies when eq . is used .",
    "for example , consider an electron in the @xmath0 ground eigenstate with wavefunction @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bohr radius .",
    "also assume that the electron is in a definite spin eigenstate so that its spin vector is given by @xmath28 .",
    "then the existence of the term @xmath29 in eq .",
    "implies that the electron s polar coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constant and that the angle @xmath32 evolves in time as @xcite @xmath33 therefore , the electron revolves about the @xmath34-axis at a constant angular velocity .",
    "we also state , for future reference , the result for an electron in the ( real ) @xmath1 eigenstate @xmath35 again with spin vector @xmath28 : the polar coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 are again constant and the angle @xmath32 evolves as @xmath36 note that the angular velocity is one - half that of a @xmath0 ground state electron . in @xcite",
    "we examined the trajectories of electrons in a number of hydrogenic eigenstates . from eq .",
    ", these trajectories must lie on level curves of both @xmath37 and @xmath34 and revolve about the @xmath34-axis with constant angular velocity .    in this paper",
    "we examine solutions of the equation of motion for an electron with spin vector @xmath28 ( the `` @xmath38 '' or `` spin up '' state ) as it undergoes a transition from the @xmath0 to @xmath1 state in hydrogen due to the presence of an oscillating electric field .",
    "we may assume that the electron has constant spin vector since the hamiltonian describing the atom in the field ( see next section ) is spin - independent .",
    "the wavefunction of the electron @xmath39 may then be written as the tensor product @xmath40 where @xmath41 is assumed to be an eigenfunction of the commuting spin operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as such",
    ", the remainder of our discussion may simply be focussed on the evolution of the spatial portion of the wavefunction , @xmath4 according to eq . .",
    "as in the case of the examples listed above , the momentum term @xmath29 will be responsible for the revolution of the electron about the @xmath34-axis .",
    "this is accompanied by a complicated motion over a hyperboloid surface of revolution that is determined from the functional forms of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 wavefunctions . moreover ,",
    "the course of the transition from the ground state to the excited state can be characterized by looking at the energy of the electron along the trajectory and the angular velocity of the revolution about the @xmath34-axis .",
    "the energy and @xmath32-angular velocity of the electron evolve from @xmath0 ground state values to @xmath6 excited state values .    in @xcite , as a precursor to this study",
    ", we examined the trajectories dictated by eq . for an electron with spin vector @xmath28 and spatial wavefunction that begins as a linear combination of @xmath0 and @xmath6 hydrogenic eigenfunctions : @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the time evolution of this wavefunction under the hydrogen atom hamiltonian is @xmath48 many of the qualitative features of the @xmath0-@xmath1 transition problem studied below are captured by this model , most notably the invariant hyperboloid surfaces of revolution on which trajectories lie . as expected , however , the more detailed time evolution of the electron trajectories over these surfaces due to the oscillating field is missing .",
    "the hamiltonian used to describe this transition will have the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the hydrogen atom hamiltonian and @xmath51 represents an oscillating electric field @xmath52 . it can be shown @xcite that if @xmath53 is chosen to be sufficiently close to the @xmath0-@xmath6 transition frequency @xmath54 so that @xmath55 , then the hamiltonian representing the semiclassical radiation , @xmath56 , is well approximated by @xmath57 since the term @xmath58 is negligible . here , @xmath59 denotes the electric charge and @xmath60 .",
    "this approach allows the equations for the wavefunction coefficients to be solved exactly so that perturbation methods need not be employed .",
    "the closeness of @xmath53 to @xmath61 also allows the transition probability to approach unity at various times rather than remaining small for all times .",
    "the probability of transition between two states @xmath62 and @xmath63 is related to the matrix element @xmath64 . in the case of the hydrogen atom",
    "the only nonvanishing matrix element is between the ground state @xmath65 and the @xmath1 state @xmath66 : @xmath67 the time - dependent wavefunction can be written as a linear combination of @xmath68 and @xmath69 : @xmath70 substitution into the schrdinger equation yields the following equations for @xmath71 and @xmath72 :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 these des can be solved exactly to give @xmath75 where @xmath76    the wavefunction @xmath77 may now be written explicitly as @xmath78 to compute the momentum according to eq . ,",
    "note that the wave function , and hence first term @xmath79 , has only @xmath80 and @xmath81 components .",
    "since we are assuming a constant spin vector @xmath82 , it follows that the vector @xmath83 points in the @xmath84 direction .    calculating @xmath79 from eq .",
    "yields @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the ratio of the normalizing factors of the two wavefunctions , @xmath87 and @xmath88 the denominator @xmath89 in the above expressions is proportional to @xmath90 .    the second term in eq . ,",
    "@xmath83 , can be computed in the ( right - handed ) spherical polar coordinate system @xmath91 using the simplification @xmath92 we find the @xmath84 component of the momentum to be @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 in summary , the three components of the momentum are given by eqs . and .",
    "it is worth noting that the spin - dependent momentum term @xmath29 in eq .",
    "is responsible for the @xmath32-momentum @xmath96 .",
    "it is useful to rescale these equations by defining the following dimensionless variables : @xmath97 in these variables , eqs . and give rise to the following system of differential equations in @xmath98 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 as functions of @xmath99 : @xmath100 where we have used the following relations : @xmath101 and @xmath102    some important qualitative features of the solutions to these des may be extracted .",
    "first note that the @xmath98 and @xmath31 des are independent of @xmath32 .",
    "> from these two equations , we have @xmath103 this de is easily solved to give @xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this relation defines a family of hyperbolae in vertical planes that contain the @xmath34-axis .",
    "i.e. , @xmath107 , a constant .",
    "( note that the right hand side of eq .",
    "is determined by the functional forms of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 wavefunctions .",
    "other allowable pairs of wavefunctions will yield different types of curves . )",
    "the solutions of eq . therefore lie on surfaces that are obtained by rotating these hyperbolae about the @xmath34-axis ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "however , the time - dependent behaviour of the trajectories lying on these invariant sets must be determined numerically .",
    "in choosing the parameters for the numerical integration , there are various factors that must be taken into account .",
    "first , recall that in order to use the hamiltonian @xmath108 , we require that the perturbing frequency @xmath53 be close to the transition frequency @xmath61 so that @xmath109 . therefore , we can not allow @xmath110 to be too large , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "if we wish to be fairly confident that a transition will occur , it is also necessary that the coefficient @xmath112 become large in magnitude at some time , i.e. , roughly unity .",
    "recall from eq . that @xmath113 , and @xmath114 . also , the derivatives in eq .",
    "are proportional to @xmath115 , and it is desirable for numerical integration that they evaluate to order 1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath116 should be significant compared to @xmath117 .",
    "now , recall that @xmath118 so that @xmath119^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] therefore we require that @xmath116 not be too large . because @xmath116 is proportional to the field strength",
    ", we are free to choose a small value .",
    "another factor to consider is that there are two angular frequencies in the problem , namely @xmath120 and @xmath61 from eqs . and . for numerical stability",
    "it is best if these are within several orders of magnitude of each other .",
    "therefore , @xmath120 should not be too small in comparison with @xmath61 .",
    "it is also desirable that @xmath112 become significant in a reasonable time . from eq . , we find that @xmath121 therefore , having @xmath120 appropriately scaled will mean that there is a high probability of seeing a transition within a reasonable time .",
    "the above considerations imply that :    1 .",
    "@xmath116 can not be too large because @xmath122^{-1/2}$ ] must be o(1 ) , 2 .",
    "@xmath123 can not be more than several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath124 and 3 .",
    "we can not increase @xmath120 by increasing @xmath110 , because we require that @xmath111 .    with these points in mind ,",
    "the parameters have been chosen as follows : @xmath125 so that @xmath126    the results of numerical integration for two choices of initial conditions are shown in figs .   and .",
    "figs .   and",
    "show the same trajectories split over five consecutive time intervals . in these latter plots ,",
    "the hyperboloid surfaces of revolution on which the trajectories lie , described at the end of the previous section , are discernable .    in standard semiclassical treatments of this problem ( see , for example , @xcite , pp .",
    "282 - 285 ) , the maximum probability of transition occurs when @xmath127 , or @xmath128 for @xmath129 . in our formulation , from eq .",
    "the maximum probability of transition occurs when @xmath130 , or @xmath131 for @xmath129 . in other words ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath110 is replaced with one on @xmath118 .",
    "this is due to our choice of hamiltonian and the fact that the equations in result from an exact integration of eq . rather than a perturbation approach .",
    "> from the above , the first occurrence of the maximum probability of transition in our problem will occur at @xmath132 or , in dimensionless time , @xmath133 .",
    "> from the numerical values chosen for the parameters above , this corresponds to @xmath134 .",
    "the causal interpretation allows us to examine the process in more detail by looking at the angular velocity @xmath135 exhibited by the trajectories . at time @xmath136",
    ", each trajectory begins at the @xmath0 ground state wavefunction , viz .",
    ", @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and we expect the electron to revolve about the @xmath34-axis with angular frequency given by eq . . when the wavefunction is approximately equal to the @xmath1 eigenstate , viz . ,",
    "@xmath139 and @xmath140 , then we expect @xmath135 to be given roughly by eq . .",
    "since the computations were performed in scaled variables @xmath98 and @xmath99 , cf .",
    ", we must first rescale the @xmath0 and @xmath1 angular velocities in @xmath32 , cf . eqs . and , in order to assess the numerical results . for the @xmath0 state ,",
    ". becomes @xmath141 the angular velocity for the @xmath1 state is simply one - half the above result .",
    "the values of the scaled angular velocity @xmath142 associated with the trajectory shown in fig . are presented as a function of @xmath99 in fig . .",
    "( in fig . are shown the corresponding values of @xmath32 . )",
    "recall that this trajectory began with the value @xmath143 . > from fig .",
    ", @xmath142 is observed to be roughly @xmath144 near @xmath145 .",
    "this is in agreement with eq . ",
    "the electron is revolving about the @xmath34-axis at the @xmath0 rate .",
    "near @xmath146 , roughly the time for @xmath147 to achieve its maximum value , we observe that @xmath148 . at that time , @xmath149 .",
    "this is in agreement with the scaled @xmath1 rate @xmath150 .    in the causal interpretation",
    "it is also possible to ascribe a value of energy along a trajectory and thereby examine the time - dependent behaviour of the energy during a transition .",
    "note that this is in contrast to standard quantum mechanics , in which we can only compute probabilities of measuring energy eigenstates @xmath151 or @xmath152 after the perturbation has been turned off .",
    "one method of computing the energy is to use the result @xmath153 implied by the hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "however , even when applied to the relatively simple wavefunction @xmath7 in eq .",
    ", this method is quite cumbersome . on the other hand , holland s method of assigning values of an observable quantity @xmath154 to points on a trajectory , which we outline below ( see @xcite , pp . 91 - 93 ) , is quite easily implemented in our problem .",
    "the usual expectation value of an observable @xmath155 is @xmath156 since @xmath155 must be hermitian , ultimately only the real portion of the expression contributes to the integral . hence define the _ local _ expectation value to be @xmath157 to find the local energy expectation value along the trajectory , we compute this quantity using the hamiltonian @xmath158 where , as before",
    ", @xmath50 is the usual hydrogen hamiltonian , and @xmath159 thus @xmath160 where @xmath4 is given by eq . .",
    "note that the relationship to the classical energy is not direct ; this local energy expectation value is not a first integral of motion , simply a quantity whose average , over trajectories , yields the quantum mechanical energy expectation value",
    ". here we will refer to it as the local energy .",
    "after some manipulations , the first term in eq .",
    "is given by @xmath161 and the second term is simply @xmath162 where , referring to eq .",
    ", @xmath163 therefore we have @xmath164 this function can be evaluated along the trajectories shown in figs . and .",
    "the results for the first trajectory are shown in fig . .",
    "note that at @xmath165 , the local energy is equal to the @xmath0 ground state energy @xmath166 , and that after the transition , the energy oscillates near the value of @xmath167 , corresponding to the energy of hydrogenic @xmath168 states .",
    "the energy is not constant even in a proximity of these points because of the extra oscillating perturbation @xmath169 that represents the semi - classical radiation field .",
    "the spike in the energy corresponds to a point along the trajectory that approaches a zero of the wavefunction .",
    "intuitively , one can understand the appearance of such a spike because the electron can not spend time in regions where @xmath170 is very small  it receives a ` kick ' from the quantum potential which corresponds to a sudden rise in its energy .",
    "plots of the quantum potential for several systems and a discussion are given in holland @xcite and references within , for example , @xcite .",
    "the energy along the trajectory shown in fig .",
    "is shown in fig . .",
    "finally , we mention that we have computed trajectories to higher times . at @xmath171 ,",
    "the scaled angular velocity @xmath142 is observed to oscillate about the @xmath0 value .",
    "the energy is also observed to oscillate about the @xmath0 value of -13.6 ev .",
    "this is in accordance with @xmath172 from eq . and the values of the parameters used in the calculation .",
    "we conclude that the transition has reversed and that the electron has returned to the @xmath0 ground state .",
    "we have studied the problem of a simple @xmath0 to @xmath1 electronic transition in hydrogen  induced by an oscillating ( semiclassical ) radiation field  in terms of the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "in contrast to bohm s original formulation @xmath173 , however , we have employed an additional spin - dependent term @xmath29 in the equation of motion , where @xmath174 .",
    "the electron is assumed to be in a `` spin up '' eigenstate , with associated spin vector @xmath175 , during the transition .",
    "the electronic trajectories lie on invariant hyperboloid surfaces of revolution about the @xmath34-axis .",
    "the nature of the trajectories over these surfaces is quite complex due to the quasiperiodic nature of the equations of motion which , in turn , arise from the interplay of the @xmath0-@xmath6 transition frequency @xmath61 , the frequency @xmath53 of the oscillating radiation and @xmath176 , the field strength .    as the electron moves over the invariant surface it also revolves about the @xmath34-axis due to the spin - dependent momentum term .",
    "the progress of the transition can be tracked by observing the local energy @xmath177 and the angular velocity @xmath135 of the electron .",
    "beginning at values associated with the @xmath0 ground state , both quantities are seen to evolve toward values associated with the @xmath1 excited state in time .",
    "the causal interpretation has offered a way to examine the phenomenon of transition which is not limited to computing the probabilities of measuring @xmath151 and @xmath152 at various times after the perturbation has been turned off .",
