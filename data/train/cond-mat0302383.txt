    "electronic phase coherence plays a fundamental role and charge is transferred coherently through the entire system .",
    "the amount of charge that is transferred per period of the modulation is in general a fraction of the electronic charge @xmath6 , which depends on the modulation path . in open devices ,",
    "electron - electron interactions are weak , and lead to ( small ) dephasing corrections to the noninteracting result for charge transfer .    in the opposite limit of closed systems , _",

    "the presence of strong coulomb repulsion between electrons is essential .",
    "it leads to the quantization of charge on the islands in units of @xmath6 .",
    "a periodic modulation of externally applied gate - voltages leads to a periodic lifting of coulomb blockade , which enables the transfer of exactly one electron per period through the device .",
    "the presence of phase coherence in this limit only leads to small corrections to the classical result , through coherent higher order charge transfer processes known as ( in)elastic co - tunneling  @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for parametric charge pumping in normal metallic systems has been found in both limits of open  @xcite and closed  @xcite systems .",

    "we will be particularly interested in the influence of the measurement apparatus of the amount of transferred charge on the phase - coherent properties of a superconducting charge pump .",
    "measurement on a quantum coherent system is achieved by connecting it to the environment provided by the measuring device .",
    "the environment in turn can be modeled as a collection of harmonic oscillators .",
    "depending on the environment , the quantum coherence is typically lost in a time which we can call the dephasing or the decoherence time once properly defined .",
    "we focus here on quantum coherent systems formed of josephson tunnel junctions , and their electromagnetic environment .",
    "these systems @xcite , or we might already call some of them devices to perform quantum logic operations ( see review in @xcite ) , hold great promise in quantum computing because of their potential in scalability .    in a superconducting system",
    "the phase difference across a junction follows the well - known ac and dc josephson relations .",
    "the theory of phase fluctuations and environment is well established for electrical circuits including small tunnel junctions @xcite .",
    "what we do here specifically is the analysis of the back - action of the measurement of electrical current on a circuit consisting of small josephson junctions . in particular",
    ", we show that unlike in a standard dissipative ammeter , the phase diffusion is limited in a measurement performed by an inductively shunted measuring circuit .",
    "measurement of tiny currents provides a read - out of josephson junction quantum bits , like the one in the so - called `` quantronium '' experiment @xcite , or in general when reading out the persistent current in a flux quantum bit ( an rf squid loop ) @xcite . as a specific example we focus on a measurement of current in a double island adiabatic cooper pair pump ( cpp ) , but our conclusions concerning the effect of an inductance limited phase diffusion measurement can easily be generalized to other josephson junction circuits with straightforward modifications , which account for the different topology of the circuit to be measured .",
    "an electron pump is a reversible device which provides quantized transport of electrical charge upon cyclic operation of gates connected to it .",
    "the simplest variant is perhaps a double island pump ( see fig .  [",
    "device]a ) in which tiny metallic ( non - superconducting ) or semiconducting grains are tunnel coupled to each other and to the surrounding electrodes , and capacitively coupled to two gates  @xcite .",
    "the islands are so small that , due to their tiny capacitance , equilibrium charge configurations on them are determined solely by electrostatics on the single electron level characterized by the scale of charging energy @xmath8 . applying @xmath9 phase shifted harmonic voltages to the two gates at a frequency @xmath10 , which is so low that it allows the system to follow the ground state configuration of charging energy at each phase of operation , current through the pump equals @xmath11 , based on transport of one electron per cycle , on a precision level of a few per cent .",
    "a more accurate but more complicated device can be built by increasing the number of islands and adjacent gates in the pump : this approach has been taken to meet with requirements in metrology  @xcite .",

    "deviations from the classical result are related to higher order tunneling processes . in general , pumps in the superconducting state",
    "are less accurate than their normal state counterparts and one fundamental reason is the coherence of the superconducting wave function . in this paper we are interested in the regime where coherent cooper pair tunneling leads to an important correction to the incoherent charge transfer .",
    "it provides an interesting , still unobserved quantum mechanical interference correction to the pumped charge ( or pumped current in continuous cycling ) @xcite : @xmath55 this result is obtained for a triangular gating , as shown in fig .",

    "although the result is perturbative in @xmath56 , the coherent interference term may be appreciable .",
    "for example for @xmath57 , still rather well within the perturbative regime , the variation of the pumped current @xmath58 , is 1.8 times larger than the magnitude of the incoherent current @xmath59 .",

    ", @xmath61 equals 32 pa , and this would produce variation in the interference term by 58 pa . detecting this phase coherent current would not only be fundamentally interesting but it would also allow one to measure dephasing in a superconducting multi - junction circuit coupled to a measuring device .",
    "we finally note that , in addition to the current @xmath62 discussed so far , a direct josephson current @xmath63 exists in response to the phase bias @xmath4 .",
    "the josephson current is maximum , @xmath64 , at the triple point p in fig .",
    "[ gating ] , where the three charge configurations @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are degenerate .",
    "the gating sequence of interest here is away from p : at any given point along the cycle at most two out of the three aforementioned relevant charge configurations are degenerate . at such a degeneracy , the josephson current is smaller , @xmath68 .",
    "the width of the degeneracy is finite , @xmath69 .",
    "hence only a fraction of the total cycle contributes to the josephson current and @xmath70 .",
    "thus @xmath63 can be distinguished from @xmath71 , as it depends differently on @xmath4 and is independent of the frequency @xmath10 .",

    "[ measure]b , represents a directly coupled measurement of current by a josephson junction . in this",
    "configuration changes in current of the measured circuit are detected as changes of lifetime of a meta - stable zero voltage ( supercurrent ) state of the measuring current biased junction @xcite .",
    "this measurement circuit will be called * b * in what follows .",
    "the measuring junction is biased with a current @xmath75 ; its capacitance @xmath76 is the capacitance due to its typically planar geometry .",
    "when biased near the critical current , @xmath77 , the junction can be characterized by the josephson inductance @xmath78 .",

    "is inductively coupled to the measured circuit . in ( b ) current",
    "is measured by determining the escape probability from the zero voltage state of a josephson junction .",
    "the inductance is provided by the measuring junction .",

    "( b ) the current biased measuring junction is replaced by its rcsj equivalent .",

    "but , as will be obvious , the value of the resistance in shunting the squid in * a * or the junction in * b * does not influence our general conclusion .",
    "furthermore , the lc - type lines in the environment , not included in the present discussion , further help to decouple the dissipative environment from the measured circuit . in * a * we can assume that the parallel amplifier impedance and in * b * the dissipative ( real ) part of the environment are included in @xmath74 .",

    "the current resolution of circuit * b * depends on optimizing its performance through the measuring junction characteristics .",
    "the ultimate limit of resolution can be reached when the junction is in the macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) limit , where escape to a finite voltage state is via tunneling through the washboard potential and thermal escape over the barrier is prohibited due to low temperature . using a trapezoidal current pulse of height @xmath75 and duration @xmath94 we then have the probability @xmath95 to escape from the zero voltage state , @xmath96 is the mqt escape rate . since @xmath96 depends on the bias current @xmath75 , we can use @xmath97 as a measure of the total current through the junction : ideally this current is the sum of the bias current and the current to be measured , as suggested by vion _",
