    "entangled quantum state is one of essential key ingredients in the implementation of quantum communication and quantum computation @xcite . among kinds of schemes proposed to generate entangled states @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamic systems(cqeds ) , which marry atomic and photonic quantum bits together ,",
    "are paid more attentions because of both its low decoherent rate and promising feasibility to scale - up . in recent years , several elegant works based on cqeds have been done . in @xcite , a pair of momentum- and polarization- entangled photons",
    "is sent to two spatially separated cavities , each of which contains a v - type atom .",
    "after the atoms absorb the photons , the photon entanglement is transferred to the atoms . in @xcite ,",
    "entangled states of two @xmath0-type atoms individually trapped in spatially separated cavities are generated through the interference of the polarized photons leaking out of the cavities on a beam splitter and co - instantaneous single - photon detections . in these schemes , in order to guarantee the interference effect , several conditions are required .",
    "first , the two atoms have to be simultaneously excited or driven .",
    "second , spatial shapes of photon pulses leaking from the cavities should be similar .",
    "third , the two photon paths from the cavities to the beam splitter must be symmetrical .",
    "in addition , the success of generating entangled atomic states is probabilistic since the photon - state - projection detection behind the beam splitter is performed .",
    "we also notice that the previous schemes are based on either photon emission or photon absorption process . in this paper",
    ", we consider a cqed system in which a @xmath0-type atom and a v - type atom are trapped individually in two spatially separated cavities that are connected by an optical fiber .",
    "this setup is closely related to two previous schemes . in @xcite , pellizzari proposed a cavity - fibre - cavity system to realize reliable transfer of a quantum state . in that scheme ,",
    "two three - level @xmath0 atoms that are adiabatically and simultaneously driven by a laser beam are trapped individually in two single - mode cavities connected via an optical fibre . in @xcite ,",
    "serafini et al employed the similar setup in which two - level atoms are trapped in fibre - connected cavities to realize highly reliable swap and entangling gates .",
    "we notice that quantum information processes realized in the fibre - connected cavity setup depends on atomic level configurations and laser driving ways . in the present scheme , without using any laser driving , only the @xmath0-type atom is initially to be pumped in the excited state . instead of using either photon absorption or photon emission as done in the previous scheme ,",
    "both the photon emission of the @xmath0-type atom and the photon absorption of the v - type atom are involved . in this way , an entangled state of the two atoms",
    "can deterministically be generated through the atom - field interaction without the photon interference and the photon - state projection detection .",

    ". this result can be easily understood . from the discussion in the preceding section ,",
    "there is only the resonant normal mode @xmath76 plays role when @xmath87 . according to ( 14 ) , the resonant normal mode is not involved with the fibre mode . in the limit , therefore , the fibre mode is not excited and is always kept in the vacuum state . on the other hand , the condition @xmath87 means that the transmission time of photons through the fibre becomes much shorter than the interaction time of the atoms with the cavity fields and then the fibre photon is equivalently kept in the vacuum state in the whole process .",
    "this reason clearly explains why the influence of photon loss can be diminished in the limit @xmath87 .    from eqs .",
    "( 9)-(13 ) , @xmath112 at @xmath113 if the condition @xmath61 is satisfied .",
    "it means that all the terms associated with the basic vectors with one fibre photon in ( 8) disappear under this condition . in this case , therefore , the fibre field in the state vector ( 8) is in the vacuum state .",
    "therefore , the appropriate choice of the ratio @xmath114 may be useful to get a higher fidelity of the entangled state even if the condition @xmath87 is not well satisfied . in fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , the results with @xmath115 and @xmath116 are shown .",
    "it is observed that the former result is obviously better than the latter one when @xmath117 .",
    "next , we investigate the influence of spontaneous emission and cavity leakage . in figs.[rkdis ] , the fidelity @xmath108 is shown for the cases with @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and different values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 . comparing these figures , we find that the atomic spontaneous emission has a stronger influence on the fidelity than the cavity photon leakage does . to obtain the fidelity higher than 0.97",
    ", one should keep the decay rates @xmath122 and @xmath123 . in recent experiments @xcite , for an optical cavity with the wavelength region @xmath124",
    ", the condition @xmath125 is achievable .",
    "therefore , the present scheme with a high fidelity larger than 0.98 is feasible in current experiments .",
    "in this paper , we propose a scheme to generate an entangled state of two atoms trapped in spatially separated two cavities that are connected by an optical fibre .",
    "we show that an extremely entangled state of the atoms can be deterministically generated if the ratio of the coupling constant of the cavity field with the atoms to the coupling constant of the cavity field with the fibre mode satisfies a certain condition .",
    "the scheme has three features .",
    "first , it is based on both the photon emission of a @xmath0-type atom and the photon absorption of a v - type atom .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the previous schemes @xcite , either a pair of entangled photons or the photon interference process is not required .",
    "second , since the present scheme is based on the interaction dynamics of atoms with cavity fields and then the co - instantaneous single photon detection is not required , the generation of entangled states is deterministic .",
    "third , in contrast to the previous schemes in which manipulations such as excitation , photon emission or absorption have to be performed simultaneously on all of atoms under consideration , such manipulations are performed respectively on each of atoms in the present scheme .",
    "this may reduce difficulties resulting from manipulations performed at the same time on two atoms .",
    "the influence of various decoherence processes such as spontaneous emission and photon loss on the generation of entangled states is also investigated .",
    "we find that the effect of photon leakage out of the fibre can be greatly depressed and even ignored if the coupling of the fibre mode with the cavity fields is much stronger than the coupling of the atoms with the cavity fields .",
    "if the condition is not well satisfied , the appropriate ratio of the coupling constant of the cavity field with the atoms to the coupling constant of the cavity field with the fibre mode can also ensure a high fidelity of generating entangled states . as regards the effect of photon loss out of the cavities and spontaneous emission of the atoms , we find that the implementation of the present scheme is within the scope of the current techniques .",
