    "in several branches of mathematics , as well as in applications , one often encounters problems of the following type : given a region in space @xmath0 , a subset @xmath1 , and a function @xmath2 , what can be said about certain properties of @xmath2 given certain properties of @xmath3 ?",
    "in specific cases one may want to reconstruct @xmath4 as accurately as possible based on knowledge of @xmath5 , in others it may be sufficient to estimate some features of @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that for this task additional global information on @xmath4 is needed . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath4 is one of the indicator functions @xmath6 or @xmath7 , an estimate based on @xmath5 would yield wrong results .",
    "the first helpful property which comes to one s mind is some regularity or smoothness property of @xmath4 .",
    "however , since there are @xmath8-functions supported inside @xmath9 ( or inside @xmath10 ) this is not quite the right condition .",
    "the required property of @xmath4 is more adequately described as _ rigidity _ , as we will see in specific theorems formulated below .    in this paper",
    "we are mainly concerned with problems with a multiscale structure .",
    "for this reason it is natural to require that the set @xmath9 is in some sense equidistributed within @xmath11 . at this point we will not give a precise definition of such sets .",
    "it will become clear that such a set @xmath9 should be relatively dense in @xmath12 or @xmath11 , and should have positive density .",
    "a particularly nice set @xmath9 would be a periodic arrangement of balls , and we want to include small perturbations of such a configuration .",
    "thus , equidistributed sets could be seen as a generalization of such a situation , cf .",
    "[ fig : equidistributed ] .",
    "we recall a well known theorem as an example or benchmark , see e.g.  @xcite . this way we will see what is the best we can hope for in the task of reconstructing a function . moreover",
    ", we will encounter one possible interpretation what the term _ rigidity _ means , and see major differences between the reconstruction problem in dimension one and higher dimensions .",
    "the shannon sampling theorem states : let @xmath13 be such that the fourier transform @xmath14 vanishes outside @xmath15 $ ]",
    ". then the series @xmath16 converges absolutely and uniformly for @xmath17 and @xmath18 thus we can reconstruct the original function @xmath4 from the sample values @xmath19 , which are multiplied with weights depending on the distance to the point @xmath17 and summed up . here",
    "the rigidity condition is implemented by the requirement @xmath20 $ ] , which implies that @xmath4 is entire .",
    "a remarkable feature of this exact result is that it is stable under perturbations : if the nodes @xmath21 deviate slightly from the integers , or if the measurement data @xmath22 are inaccurate , the error @xmath23 can still be controlled . if the support condition @xmath20 $ ] is violated , the _ aliasing error _ is estimated as @xmath24 this will give , for instance , good results for centered gaussians with appropriate variance .    statements and are strong with respect to the sampling set @xmath25 , which is very thin .",
    "it has zero lebesgue measure , in fact , it is discrete .",
    "albeit , it is relatively dense in @xmath26 , so it has some of the properties we associated with an equidistributed set .",
    "compared to shannon s theorem , the results we present below appear much weaker .",
    "this is , among others , due to two features : we consider functions on multidimensional space , which , in addition , have low regularity , in fact are defined as equivalence classes in some @xmath27 or sobolev space . in this situation evaluation of a function at a point",
    "may not have a proper meaning .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we have to consider samples @xmath9 which are composed of small balls , rather than single points . a second aspect where dimensionality comes into play",
    "is the following : a polynomial of one variable of degree @xmath28 vanishes identically if it has @xmath29 zeros .",
    "a non - trivial polynomial in two variables may vanish on an uncountable set ( albeit not on one of positive measure ) .",
    "this illustrates that reconstruction estimates for functions of several variables are more subtle than shannon s theorem .",
    "consequently , one has to settle for more modest goals than the full reconstruction of the function @xmath4 .",
    "we want to derive an equidistribution property for functions satisfying some rigidity property .",
    "as will be detailed later this result is called  depending on the context and scientific environment  scale free unique continuation property , observability estimate , or uncertainty relation . a first result of this type is formulated in the next section .",
    "the following result @xcite was motivated by questions arising in the spectral theory of random schrdinger operators .",
    "later , it turned out that similar estimates are of relevance in the control theory of the heat equation .",
    "we fix some notation . for @xmath30 we denote by @xmath31 a cube in @xmath12 . for @xmath32 the open ball centered at @xmath33 with radius @xmath34 is denoted by @xmath35 . for a sequence of points @xmath36 indexed by @xmath37 we denote the collection of balls @xmath38 by @xmath9 and its intersection with @xmath39 by @xmath40 .",
    "we will be dealing with certain self - adjoint operators on subsets of @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the @xmath42-dimensional laplacian , @xmath43 a bounded measurable function , and @xmath44 a schrdinger operator on the cube @xmath39 with dirichlet or periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the corresponding domains are denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "note that we denote a multiplication operator by the same symbol as the corresponding function .",
    "[ thm : rojasveselic ] let @xmath47 .",
    "then there exists @xmath48 such that for all @xmath49 , all measurable @xmath50 $ ] , all real - valued @xmath51 with @xmath52 almost everywhere on @xmath39 , and all sequences @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 we have @xmath55    to appreciate the result properly , the quantitative dependence of the constant @xmath56 on model parameters is crucial .",
    "the very formulation of the theorem states that @xmath56 is independent of position of the balls @xmath57 within @xmath58 , and independent of the scale @xmath59 .",
    "the estimates given in section 2 of @xcite show moreover , that @xmath56 depends on the potential @xmath60 only through the norm @xmath61 ( on an exponential scale ) , and it depends on the small radius @xmath32 polynomially , i.e.  @xmath62 , for some @xmath63 which depends on the dimension @xmath42 and @xmath61 .",
    "this shows that we are not able to control the integral @xmath64 by evaluating @xmath65 at the midpoints @xmath37 of the unit cubes .",
    "one sees with what rate the estimate diverges , as the balls become smaller and approximate a single point .",
    "the polynomial behavior @xmath62 can be readily understood when looking at monomials @xmath66 on the unit interval @xmath67 .",
    "there we have @xmath68 we formulated the theorem only for the eigenvalue zero , but it is easily applied to other eigenfunctions as well since @xmath69 consequently the constant @xmath70 has to be replaced with the possibly larger @xmath71 .",
    "there is a very natural question , which was spelled out in @xcite , namely does the same estimate hold true for linear combinations @xmath72 } ( h_l)$ ] of eigenfunctions as well ?",
    "the property in question can be equivalently stated as : given @xmath73 there is a constant @xmath74 such that for all measurable @xmath75 $ ] , all @xmath76 , and all sequences @xmath77 with @xmath78 for all @xmath37 we have @xmath79 } ( h_l ) \\ , w_l \\ , \\chi_{(-\\infty , e ] } ( h_l ) \\geq",
    "c~ \\chi_{(-\\infty , e ] } ( h_l ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the indicator function of @xmath40 and @xmath81 denotes the spectral projector of @xmath82 onto the interval @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath84 is determined by @xmath85 alone .",
    "note that all considered operators are lower bounded by @xmath86 in the sense of quadratic forms .",
    "thus the spectral projection on the energy interval @xmath87 $ ] is the same as the spectral projection on the energy interval @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "the upper bound @xmath89 in the energy parameter is crucial for preventing the corresponding eigenfunctions to oscillate too much .",
    "one can pose a modified version of the question : given @xmath90 is there is a constant @xmath91 such that for all measurable @xmath75 $ ] , all @xmath76 , and all sequences @xmath77 with @xmath78 for all @xmath37 we have @xmath92 } ( h_l ) \\ , w_l \\ , \\chi_{[a , b ] } ( h_l ) \\geq",

    "klein obtained a positive answer to the question for sufficiently short intervals .",

    "a generalization of theorem  [ thm : klein-13 ] to intervals of arbitrary length is given in section  [ sec : ntv ] .",
    "this answers completely the question posed in @xcite .",
    "depending on the context and the area of mathematics the above described estimates carry various names . if one speaks of an _ equidistribution property of eigenfunctions _ , one is interested in the comparison of the measure @xmath108 with the uniform distribution on the cube @xmath39 .",
    "the term _ scale free unique continuation principle _",
    "is used in works concerning random schrdinger operators .",
    "it refers to a quantitative version of the classical unique continuation principle , which is uniform on all large length scales .",
    "one can interpret theorem  [ thm : rojasveselic ] as an _ uncertainty relation _ : the condition @xmath109 corresponds to a restriction in momentum / fourier - space and enforces a delocalization / flatness property in direct space .",
    "similarly , the spectral projector @xmath110}$ ] in ineq .   corresponds to a restriction in momentum space .",
    "here we see a direct analogy to shannon s theorem discussed above : if the fourier transform of a function is sufficiently concentrated , the function itself can not vary too much over short distances .",
    "ineq .   can also be interpreted as a _ gain of positive definiteness_. it says that for a general self - adjoint operator @xmath111 , which may have a kernel , and an appropriately chosen spectral projector @xmath112 of the hamiltonian , the restriction @xmath113 is strictly positive . in control theory results as we discuss them are sometimes called _ observability _ estimates .",
    "this term is more common for time - dependent partial differential equations , but sometimes used for stationary ones as well .    in the literature on random schrdinger operators related results",
    "have been derived before in a number of papers . for more details",
    "we refer to section 1 of @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic result for the _ weak unique continuation principle _ is the following .",
    "a solution of @xmath114 satisfying @xmath115 for arbitrary small , but positive @xmath34 , must vanish on all of @xmath12 .",
    "the restrictive conditions can be relaxed .",
    "first of all , the condition @xmath116 can be replaced by @xmath117 in this form the implication is called _ strong unique continuation principle_. moreover , the laplacian @xmath118 can be replaced by a rather general second order elliptic operator .",
    "we will discuss related results in sections [ sec : nrt ] and [ sec : btv ] . a powerful method to prove unique continuation statements , as well as quantitative versions thereof , are carleman estimates .",
    "originally , carleman @xcite derived them for functions of two variables .",
    "later mller @xcite extended the estimates to higher dimensions . by now , there are hundreds of papers dealing with carleman estimates .",
    "we will describe one explicit version in section  [ sec : nrt ] , which is an important tool for the quantitative unique continuation estimates discussed shortly for schrdinger operators . in section  [ sec : btv ] we will present new results in this direction which deal with elliptic second order operators with variable coefficients .      in @xcite bourgain and kenig derived the following pointwise quantitative unique continuation principle .",
