    "production of even @xmath37-parity hadronic matter in @xmath38 scattering provides a unique opportunity to study the properties of strong interactions . to leading order in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) these processes",
    "are described as the interaction between two photons emitted by the scattered electrons .",
    "although in @xmath38 scattering the probe and the target are both represented by photons that are carriers of the electromagnetic force , these space - like photons can produce a pair of quarks that interact strongly and are observed in the form of hadrons .",
    "therefore , by measuring the four - momenta of the scattered electrons we can study the dynamics of strong interactions .",
    "the quantities of interest in these studies are the form factors associated with the transitions between the photons and the hadrons .",
    "this article describes the measurements  @xcite of the differential cross sections for the production of a single pseudoscalar meson in @xmath38 scattering : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "we measure these cross sections in a `` single - tagged '' experimental mode where one of the scattered electrons is detected ( `` tagged '' ) , while the other electron is scattered at a very small angle and therefore remains undetected ( `` _ un_tagged '' ) .",
    "the mesons produced in @xmath38 scattering are observed through their decays to various fully reconstructed final states .",
    "the tagged electron emits a highly off - shell photon ( @xmath44 ) , whereas the untagged electron emits a nearly on - shell photon ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we measure the dependence of the meson production rate on the squared momentum transfer @xmath46 carried by the highly off - shell photon .",
    "this momentum transfer is determined by energy - momentum conservation as applied to the tag : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the four - momenta of the incident beam - energy electron and the tag , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are corresponding energies , and @xmath52 is the scattering angle . ] . from the measurements of the differential rates",
    "@xmath53 we obtain the transition form factors @xmath54 that describe the effect of the strong interaction in the @xmath55 transition amplitudes .    to relate the differential cross sections to the transition form factors we employ the theoretical framework developed by v.m .",
    "budnev  @xcite ( bgms formalism ) . in bgms the process @xmath56 is divided into two parts : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the first part is completely calculable in qed and the second part is defined in terms of the transition form factors @xmath59 . in the case of pseudoscalar mesons",
    "there is only one form factor . at zero momentum transfer",
    "this form factor is expressed as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the qed coupling constant , @xmath62 is the mass and @xmath63 is the two - photon partial width of the meson @xmath40 .",
    "the transition form factors can not be calculated directly from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "however , they have been estimated using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , a sum - rules approach , and other theoretical methods .",
    "one of the important concepts of pqcd - based methods is a factorization procedure that separates perturbative short - distance effects from non - perturbative long - distance ones .",
    "while the former are understood well and can be calculated using pqcd , the latter are known only asymptotically , in the limit @xmath64 . in pqcd - based calculations",
    "the transition form factor @xmath54 is expressed as a convolution of a perturbative hard scattering amplitude ( hsa )  @xcite and the soft non - perturbative wave function of the meson .",
    "brodsky and lepage employed pqcd to find the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath55 transition form factors in the limit @xmath64  @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the meson decay constant .",
    "in addition , it has been predicted that in this limit any mesonic wave function evolves to the asymptotic wave function of unique shape  @xcite .",
    "while pqcd predicts the form factors of the @xmath55 transitions at large momentum transfer , the behavior of these form factors in the limit @xmath67 can be determined from the axial anomaly  @xcite in the chiral limit of qcd . for @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "the axial anomaly yields  @xcite : @xmath68 to leading order in @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the masses of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 quarks .",
    "this prediction does not hold with the same precision for @xmath43 due to the larger value of the @xmath75-quark mass .",
    "in addition , even if the @xmath75-quark mass were small , this prediction might be broken for @xmath43 because this particle is an unlikely candidate for the goldstone boson  @xcite .    to describe the soft non - perturbative region of @xmath76",
    "a simple interpolation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 limits has been proposed  @xcite : @xmath79    to quantify the long - distance effects in the soft non - perturbative region , chernyak and zhitnitsky employed the sum - rules method  @xcite to derive the wave function of the pion at experimentally accessible momentum transfers ( the cz wave function )  @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the proposed wave function successfully describes experimental data on the @xmath80 decay into two pions and the electromagnetic form factor of the charged pion .",
    "however , because the theoretical predictions for these processes depend on the strong interaction coupling constant @xmath81 , this introduced a large uncertainty in the determination of the cz wave function .",
    "since the asymptotic and cz wave functions were proposed , they have often been used to describe the non - perturbative parts of transition amplitudes in various pqcd calculations .",
    "jakob , kroll , and raulfs employed these wave functions and pqcd to calculate @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "these authors have also taken into account small qcd radiative corrections , incorporated into the pqcd technique by lee and sterman  @xcite .",
    "kroll has concluded that the cz wave function disagrees with our preliminary results  @xcite . on the contrary , a competing perturbative analysis of cao ,",
    "huang , and ma  @xcite yielded that either the asymptotic or the cz wave function is sufficient to describe the data .",
    "these authors took into account quark transverse momentum corrections and neglected the qcd radiative corrections , estimating the latter as small .    while pqcd - based methods are often employed to predict rates for exclusive processes branching fraction  @xcite ; see also  @xcite .",
    "] , the applicability of these methods at experimentally accessible momentum transfers remains one of the outstanding problems of the theory of strong interactions .",
    "extensive discussion of the validity of the pqcd approach can be found in the literature  @xcite .    to avoid ambiguities of the pqcd - inspired calculations at @xmath76 of the order of several @xmath83 , radyushkin  developed an approach  @xcite based on the sum - rules method  @xcite that they employed to predict the @xmath84 transition form factor  @xcite .",
    "this prediction depends on the model of the hadronic spectrum chosen to describe an almost real photon emitted by the untagged electron .",
    "it also depends on the values of vacuum condensates which represent non - perturbative matrix elements .",
    "the theoretical result of radyushkin  reproduces the pqcd - predicted @xmath85 shape of the transition form factor but disagrees with the absolute value given by eqn .",
    "[ eq:41 ] by about  @xmath86 in the limit @xmath78 .",
    "the authors have stressed that this discrepancy is irrelevant in the region of @xmath76 below 10 @xmath83 and could , in principle , be eliminated by including the qcd evolution into the theoretical analysis  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the discussed theoretical analysis exactly reproduces the asymptotic prediction of pqcd given by eqn .",
    "[ eq:41 ] when both photons are highly off - mass shell .",
    "we should emphasize that at present the non - perturbative treatment of various exclusive processes in a way similar to the approach of radyushkin  is the subject of significant theoretical interest .",
    "for example , the qcd sum - rules method has been employed recently to predict the form factors in the semileptonic decays of the @xmath87 mesons  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 transition form factors have been studied by several experiments .",
    "the experiment measured @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the time - like momentum transfer region up to 0.24  @xmath83 using the rare electromagnetic decays @xmath90 and @xmath91  @xcite . in order to achieve higher values of @xmath76 ,",
    "the space - like photons produced in two - photon interactions were utilized by the pluto experiment to measure @xmath89 up to 1 @xmath83  @xcite and by the @xmath92 collaboration to study @xmath88 and @xmath89 up to 7 @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the cello experiment measured @xmath82 at @xmath76 up to @xmath93 @xmath83 and @xmath88 and @xmath89 at @xmath76 up to @xmath94 @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "we employ two - photon interactions to measure the transition form factors @xmath54 in the space - like regions of the momentum transfer between @xmath95 and @xmath5 @xmath83 for @xmath41 , @xmath95 and @xmath6 @xmath83 for @xmath42 , and @xmath95 and @xmath7 @xmath83 for @xmath2 .",
    "we study the transition form factors of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 using the decays :    @xmath96 ,    @xmath97 ,    @xmath98 ,    @xmath99 ,    @xmath100 ,    @xmath101 ,    @xmath102 ,    @xmath103 ,    @xmath104 ,    @xmath105 ,    @xmath106 .",
    "we analyze the last two decay chains of @xmath43 together since they are observed in the same final state @xmath107 .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section  ii describes the cleo  ii detector and the data sample that we use for our measurements .",
    "event selection criteria , experimental technique , and the analysis procedure for @xmath108 final states are explained in section  iii .",
    "analyses of other final states with only photons are described in section  iv and analyses of final states with charged pions are described in section  v. the unfolding procedure for the transition form factors is described in section  vi .",
    "the results are compared with some existing theoretical predictions in section  vii .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  viii .",
    "the cleo  ii detector  @xcite is a general - purpose magnetic spectrometer which provides energy and momentum measurements for elementary particles .",
    "it is operated at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) , a symmetric @xmath38 collider running at a center - of - mass energy near 10.6 gev .",
    "the major objectives of the cleo experiment are the studies of the properties of heavy mesons that contain @xmath109 or @xmath110 quarks .",
    "however , owing to the versatility of the detector , analyses of tagged and untagged two - photon interactions , detailed studies of @xmath111-lepton decays , and careful examination of quark and gluon fragmentation and other processes are also possible .",
    "the active components of cleo  ii include central tracking detectors , time - of - flight ( tf ) scintillator counters , muon detectors , and a csi calorimeter for electromagnetic showers .",
    "the calorimeter consists of a barrel part covering polar angles above  @xmath112 and two endcap parts each covering the region between  @xmath113 and  @xmath112 , where the polar angle is measured with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the energy resolution of the barrel calorimeter for photons of energies above 500 mev is  2% .",
    "the central tracking detectors consist of three concentric cylindrical drift chambers that cover the polar angles above  @xmath114 . from smallest to largest radii",
    "these are : the precision tracking layers detector , the vertex detector ( vd ) , and the main drift chamber .",
    "the measurements of the specific ionization energy losses in the outer layers of the main drift chamber and flight times in the tf system provide discrimination between charged particles of different species .",
    "all detector subsystems except the muon detectors reside in a uniform axial magnetic field of 1.5 tesla .",
    "the data sample employed in our analysis corresponds to an integrated @xmath38 luminosity of @xmath115 fb@xmath116 .",
    "two thirds of the data was collected at @xmath38 center - of - mass energy of @xmath117 gev , the remainder at 10.52 gev .",
    "the cleo  ii detector has a three - level hardware trigger system  @xcite followed by a software filter .",
    "the fastest , `` zeroth '' level ( l0 ) trigger can be either track - based ( using the vd and tf ) or energy - based ( demanding a minimum energy deposition of about 500 mev in the csi calorimeter ) .",
    "the calorimeter l0 information develops slowly , so it only comes into effect if the track - based l0 trigger fails ; in such cases the tracking information is lost .",
    "the first level ( l1 ) trigger uses track - based information from the vd , tf , and main drift chamber ; tracks of transverse momenta in excess of about  340 mev / c are identified by either of two independent track processors employed in the trigger decisions .",
    "calorimeter information is also utilized at l1 .",
    "high threshold bits , designed to be set by showering particles , have a threshold of about @xmath118 mev ; low threshold bits , designed to trigger on minimum ionizing particles , have a threshold of about 100 mev .",
    "to trigger at l1 on two low - energy clusters , they must be well - separated in space .",
    "more detailed information from the vd and main drift chamber is used in the second level ( l2 ) trigger .",
    "the requirements and accessed momentum range varied between data subsets , but are all modeled in our detector simulations . the software filter ( lvl3 )",
    "is optimized to suppress backgrounds from interactions of the beams with residual gas and vacuum chamber walls .",
    "events which pass lvl3 are recorded .",
    "in addition , every eighth event that fails lvl3 is also recorded to allow the lvl3 efficiency to be studied .",
    "the efficiencies of the various trigger components have been measured using data collected with independent or partially independent simultaneous trigger requirements and are incorporated in the detector simulations  @xcite .",
    "the simulations are carefully run to match the integrated luminosity associated with each trigger configuration .",
    "this is necessary because exact trigger requirements in cleo  ii have been changed over time to improve the trigger efficiency for events of low particle multiplicities .      in our analysis",
    "we use a two - photon monte carlo ( mc ) simulation program @xcite that is based on the bgms formalism  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath119 transition form factors are approximated by : @xmath120 where @xmath46 and @xmath121 are the absolute values of the squared four - momenta carried by the space - like photons .",
    "the pole - mass parameter has been chosen to approximate the momentum transfer dependence of the form factors .",
    "it should be noted that while we have chosen this parameter to be practically the @xmath122 mass , as predicted by the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model  @xcite , the pole - mass behavior of the transition form factors @xmath54 and the value of the parameter @xmath123 in the range between 700 and 900 mev are indicated by various theoretical predictions  @xcite that are not based on vmd .",
    "notice that in the approximation given by eqn .",
    "[ eq:137 ] we assume a factorization of the form factor into the @xmath121- and @xmath46-dependent parts  @xcite . in the same two - photon simulation program we also generate the decays of the produced mesons . to account for the relativistic effects , helicity conservation , and presence of spin - one particles we simulate the decay chain @xmath100 according to : @xmath124    with the energy - dependent width , @xmath125 , parameterized by :    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the angle between the directions of one of the charged pions and the signal photon , @xmath128 is the energy of the photon , @xmath129 mev and @xmath130 mev / c@xmath8 are the nominal width and mass of @xmath131  @xcite , @xmath132 is the actual mass of @xmath131 , and @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the magnitudes of the charged - pion momenta for the actual and nominal masses of @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the charged - pion momenta and the angle @xmath127 are defined in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath131 and the energy of the photon is defined in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath43 .",
    "the transport of the generated mc particles through the cleo  ii detector is performed by a geant - based  @xcite detector simulation program .",
    "the generated events are then processed by the event reconstruction program which also `` simulates '' random electronic noise and beam - related spurious energy clusters by adding hits from random - trigger data samples into the mc events .",
    "the single - tagged two - photon reactions @xmath135 and @xmath136 followed by the decays @xmath137@xmath138@xmath139 and @xmath1@xmath138@xmath139 are recorded using either a track - based or an energy - based l0 trigger . the track - based l0 trigger is satisfied when the scattered electron passes through the vd and enters the endcap tf . for tags that scatter at polar angles above  @xmath140 , thus passing through the entire vd volume , the efficiency of this trigger is about  @xmath141 and is determined by the size of the wire - chamber drift cells compared to the time allowed to make the l0 decision . at smaller polar angles we rely on the energy - based l0 trigger .",
    "the efficiency of this trigger is  98%  ( 100% ) for electrons which deposit  1.0 gev ( more than  1.6 gev ) of energy in the calorimeter .",
    "the l1 trigger is satisfied when at least two clusters , each of energy above 500 mev , are detected in the calorimeter , with one in the barrel region and the other in one of the endcap regions .",
    "there are no l2 requirements for events passing the l0 and l1 trigger conditions described above .    to be recorded",
    ", events must fulfill the transverse - momentum requirement of the lvl3 filter that assigns momenta to all calorimeter clusters assuming that they are photons produced at the primary interaction point in the geometrical center of the cleo  ii detector .",
    "this lvl3 criterion rejects events if the net vector momentum has a component normal to the beam axis in excess of 0.7 gev / c ( 1.4 gev / c ) when the total energy detected in the calorimeter is larger than 1.0 ( 5.0 ) gev .",
    "in the first part of this section we describe the event selection criteria based on the event topology for the signal production processes .",
    "in the second part we explain selection criteria aimed at the suppression of random background . in the third part",
    "we discuss the event quality requirements designed to isolate signal events with large uncertainty in the detection efficiency .",
    "finally , in the last part of this section we show the invariant mass spectra for data events that fulfill all selection criteria .      the event selection criteria for single - tagged @xmath108 final states are designed to isolate two - photon events for which the trigger efficiency is high and in which the only missing particle is the untagged electron of high momentum .",
    "these events are characterized by the high - energy shower produced by the tag in the endcap calorimeter and two electromagnetic showers of total energy larger than 1 gev produced by the photons in the barrel calorimeter .",
    "we select events in which three or four energy clusters and no more than one charged track have been reconstructed .",
    "the energy of each barrel ( endcap ) cluster must be larger than 30 ( 50 ) mev . the most energetic cluster is assumed to be produced by the tag and must be in the endcap calorimeter .",
    "if a charged track is found , its projected intersection point with the calorimeter must agree with the tag s shower position within  @xmath142 as estimated at the primary interaction point .",
    "the position of each shower is determined from the energy - weighted average of the centers of the crystals forming this shower . to provide an efficient trigger ,",
    "the energy of the tag candidate detected in the calorimeter should be above  1.0  gev ( at a later stage of the analysis procedure this cut will be superseded by a tighter requirement ) .",
    "out of the remaining energy clusters , the two most energetic must be found in the barrel calorimeter at polar angles above  @xmath143 ( _ i.e. _ , excluding calorimeter edges ) , and are assumed to have come from the @xmath41 or @xmath42 decays . the fourth energy cluster ,",
    "if found , should contain less than 200 mev of energy ; the efficiency loss due to this requirement is less than  0.25% .",
    "events with this additional energy cluster may be either signal or beam - gas events with a beam - related noise cluster or partially reconstructed background events of higher particle multiplicities that mimic single - tagged @xmath41 or @xmath42 production . by allowing an extra energy cluster , we reduce the uncertainty in the signal efficiency while providing the opportunity for background estimates .",
    "a tighter cut on the energy of an additional cluster would make our results more sensitive to the modelling of the noise - related energy clusters and a looser cut on this extra energy would not adequately discriminate against signal - like background which is due to partially reconstructed events .",
    "the overall efficiencies of the basic selection criteria described above are  38% and  30% for the @xmath41 and @xmath42 analyses , respectively .",
    "these estimates have been obtained using mc signal events generated in the @xmath76 range between  1.5 and  9 @xmath83 .",
    "the background conditions in two - photon events of low particle multiplicities with tags detected at large and ( relatively ) small polar angles are different .",
    "to provide an adequate background suppression for both regions of polar angle , we separate signal event candidates into two samples that have undergone different experimental cuts . in this subsection",
    "we describe this event separation , the sources of random background and the event selection criteria applied to each sample to suppress random background .",
    "when the scattering angle of the tag is larger than  @xmath140 ( as determined from the calorimeter ) we select events that have been triggered by the track - based l0 trigger . in addition",
    ", we require that these events have exactly one reconstructed charged track consistent with the tag s shower .",
    "there is no efficiency loss associated with the tracking requirement which discriminates against background arising mainly from radiative bhabha events accompanied by photon conversion or bremsstrahlung .",
    "we include these events in the track - tagged sample .",
    "when the scattering angle is less than  @xmath140 we accept both track- and energy - based l0 triggers and do not require the presence of the tag s track , because the efficiencies of the track - based l0 trigger and track reconstruction vanish for tags detected in this region of polar angles .",
    "we include these events that have been triggered either by the track - based or energy - based l0 trigger in the energy - tagged sample .",
    "notice that while the events from the track - tagged sample must be track - triggered , the events from the energy - tagged sample could be either track- or energy - triggered .",
    "tracking information for events from the track - tagged sample is utilized in background estimates .",
    "the track reconstruction efficiency for energy - triggered events is zero .    before imposing further selection criteria we obtain improved estimates of the tag energy and direction by using transverse - momentum balance and",
    "the tag coordinates in the calorimeter .",
    "the transverse momenta of the tag and of the photon pair should be nearly identical for signal events because the untagged electron usually carries very little transverse momentum ( below 5  mev / c ) according to the prediction of the mc simulation .",
    "since the transverse momentum of the photon pair is measured with much better precision than that of the tag , we equate the magnitude of the transverse momentum of the tag with that of the signal photon pair . to calculate the direction of the tag we require that its trajectory in the magnetic field goes through the center of the tag s shower . to estimate the center of the shower we use the measurement from the calorimeter when the shower is found at polar angles larger than  @xmath144 .",
    "at smaller polar angles , however , we use the geometrical center of the crystal with the largest detected energy .",
    "this is necessary in order to reduce the discrepancies between the data and mc simulation . using the estimates of the tag energy and direction obtained from the transverse - momentum balance we estimate the missing energy and the magnitude of missing momentum . to suppress the background from partially reconstructed events we select events where the discrepancy between the missing energy and missing momentum is less than  2.3 gev .",
    "this cut is  98% efficient for our signal .",
    "we note that at a later stage of the analysis procedure we will obtain more precise estimates of the tag energy and direction .    not only should the magnitudes of the transverse momenta of the tag and the photon pair be nearly equal , their directions are expected to be practically opposite in the plane perpendicular to the beam collision axis .",
    "we use the acoplanarity angle , which is the deviation from this expectation , to suppress the background arising from radiative bhabha events with bremsstrahlung photons produced in the materials of the detector .",
    "an event of this origin enters the energy - tagged sample when the track - based l0 trigger is inefficient and a track associated with an electron which radiated in the barrel part of the detector can not be reconstructed . while for signal events the acoplanarity distribution peaks near zero , for background events it peaks around  @xmath145 for the cleo geometry and cesr kinematics .",
    "acoplanarity discriminates between signal and background events because the measured angular position of the shower created by the electron that has undergone bremsstrahlung is shifted with respect to its direction at the primary interaction point .",
    "this shift is due to the bending of the electron track in the magnetic field . to suppress this random qed background in the energy - tagged sample , we select events with acoplanarity less than  @xmath146 .",
    "the background rejection power of this cut exceeds  10 , while efficiency loss varies between  20% and  10% for @xmath76 between  1.5 and  2.5 @xmath83 . for @xmath76 larger than  2.5 @xmath83",
    "the efficiency of the acoplanarity cut for the energy - tagged events is  90% .",
    "in contrast to the energy - tagged sample , the track - tagged sample contains very few bremsstrahlung - accompanied radiative bhabha events because each of these background events has an additional charged track and does not pass basic selection criteria ( the track reconstruction efficiency for high - energy electrons detected in the barrel part of the detector is practically  100% for events recorded by the track - based l0 trigger ) .",
    "we select the track - tagged events with acoplanarity less than  @xmath147 .",
    "the efficiency of this loose cut on acoplanarity is  99% .",
    "we use the decay angle @xmath148 to further suppress background arising from radiative bhabha events accompanied by low - energy split - off clusters .",
    "the decay angle is determined from the directions of the @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) candidate in the lab frame and one of the daughter photons in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) .",
    "simulation of the detector acceptance predicts that the distribution of @xmath149 is flat between  0.0 to  0.95 and decreases rapidly beyond  0.95 due to the acceptance loss for soft photons .",
    "in contrast to the signal , radiative bhabha events with split - off clusters congregate at @xmath150 because these clusters typically are of low - energy .",
    "we reject these asymmetric decays by requiring @xmath151 .",
    "the acoplanarity and decay angle cuts do not eliminate random background completely , because radiative bhabha events accompanied by @xmath45 conversions in detector materials look similar to signal events when triggered by the energy - based l0 trigger .",
    "however , we have found that the shape of this background is monotonic within the signal and sideband regions of the @xmath108 invariant mass distribution in both analyses .      the angular spectrum of the scattered electrons peaks sharply at small polar angles due to the kinematics of processes studied in our analyses .",
    "thus , to measure the cross sections for two - photon production in a tagged mode we must understand this critical region of our experimental apparatus very well . while we can , in principle , detect tags at polar angles as small as  @xmath113 , the fraction of the tag energy collected in the calorimeter at these small polar angles is usually less than  20% and might be insufficient to trigger an event .",
    "in addition , even if the trigger is satisfied , an event might be rejected by the lvl3 filter , which is biased against events with large net transverse momenta .",
    "to select events identified in the detector regions where the trigger and lvl3 efficiencies are well understood , we need better estimates of the tag energy and scattering angle .    to make precise estimates of the tag energy and scattering angle we use energy - momentum conservation assuming that the only particle missing detection is the untagged electron with zero transverse momentum . in practice , this method allows us to estimate the parameters of the tag when we measure only the four - momentum of the hadronic system and assume that we know the charge of the untagged electron ( from crude measurement of the direction of missing momentum ) . from conservation laws we estimate the tag energy @xmath152 with an r.m.s .",
    "resolution of  0.003  @xmath152 and the scattering angle with an r.m.s .",
    "resolution of better than  @xmath153 .",
    "in addition , to estimate the scattering angle for track - tagged events we use the polar angle of the reconstructed charged track associated with the tag . by using the polar angle of the track we achieve an additional small improvement in the resolution of the scattering angle for these events .",
    "the tag energy for track - tagged events , however , is estimated from energy - momentum conservation ; _ i.e. _ no tracking information is used to estimate the tag energy . in further discussions the values of the tag s parameters estimated from energy - momentum conservation and the polar angle of the charged track",
    "are referred to as constrained values of the tag energy and scattering angle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_01 ] we show the resolution functions of the tag energy and scattering angle determined from the differences between analyzed ( _ i.e. _ measured or constrained ) and generated quantities ( normalized to the generated value for the energy resolution function ) .",
    "these resolution functions have been obtained using simulated @xmath41 events which have values of @xmath76 between  1.5 and  9 @xmath83 and satisfy all selection criteria discussed above . in our analyses we estimate @xmath76 for each event using constrained values of the tag energy and scattering angle .",

    "the primary uncertainty is due to systematic biases in the determination of the event selection efficiency .",
    "these biases are detailed below .",
    "the second contribution is a  1% systematic error on integrated luminosity  @xcite .",

    "the fourth source of systematic error is due to small uncertainties in the branching fractions for studied decay chains .",
    "this error is negligible in the @xmath155 analysis and is less than  1% in the @xmath156 analysis .",
    "the largest systematic error is due to the fractional tag - energy cut .",
    "we have measured the efficiency of this cut using radiative bhabha events in data .",
    "the relative statistical error in this efficiency is less than  3% for polar angles larger than  @xmath147 so we conservatively include a  3% error to the systematics of energy - tagged events .",

    "the efficiency of the lvl3 filter has been measured using @xmath41 signal data events that would have normally been discarded by this filter .",
    "the statistical error in the measured efficiency is  2% and this gives an estimate of the systematic error .",

    "we have measured the efficiency of the vd l0 trigger over the entire data sample using the tf - triggered endcap bhabha events and have found that this efficiency varies by up to  2.5% of its central value between data subsets . in our analysis",
    "we use the average value for the vd l0 trigger efficiency of  80% and include its variation of  2% to the systematic error for track - tagged events .    to estimate the systematic uncertainty in the efficiency of the extra energy cut we have utilized the shape of the extra energy distribution measured from signal data in the @xmath167 analysis .",

    "the efficiency of the acoplanarity cut for energy - tagged events is between  80% and  90% , depending on @xmath76 . to estimate the uncertainty in this cut ,",
    "we have measured its efficiency assuming that the detector simulation systematically underestimates or overestimates azimuthal angular positions of all showers and the tag in the calorimeter by one standard deviation of the angular resolution function .",
    "we find that under these conditions the efficiency varies by less than  1% of itself in any @xmath76 interval .",
    "we include this value of  1% to the systematics of energy - tagged events .",
    "we have also studied other sources of uncertainties such as the efficiencies of missing energy - momentum and decay angle cuts and conclude that their total contribution to the systematics is insignificant .",
    "we include the systematic uncertainties in the amount of feed - down background and in the shape of the @xmath108-mass spectrum for random background to the statistical error on the number of signal events in each @xmath76 interval .",
    "these errors are between  1% and  5% being larger at smaller @xmath76 .",
    "while the acoplanarity and fractional tag - energy cuts affect only energy - tagged events , the track - based l0 trigger is specific for the track - tagged events .",
    "thus , the systematic uncertainties associated with the two event samples are different . to estimate the systematics for each @xmath76 interval we have used the @xmath76 distributions for mc events which belong to the energy- and track - tagged samples .",

    "when a radiative photon carries away part of the initial center - of - mass energy and remains undetected , we use the nominal value of the beam energy before the radiation and overestimate  @xmath76 according to eqn .  [ eq:12 ] .",
    "however , when we estimate the tag energy and scattering angle from energy - momentum conservation , we underestimate  @xmath76 .",
    "both distortions described above are small effects because the energy spectrum of radiative photons is very soft .",
    "we neglect the effect of the qed radiative corrections on the smearing of the @xmath76 spectrum because these two small effects largely cancel each other .",
    "the net smearing is such that in our analysis procedure the measured cross sections are insignificantly underestimated .",
    "there is another aspect of the qed radiative corrections that might need to be taken into account .",
    "namely , when we unfold the differential cross sections and obtain the transition form factors , we rely on the prediction of a numerical integration that does not contain these corrections and underestimates the cross sections . we expect the qed radiative corrections to the cross sections for single - tagged events to be smaller than  2.4%  @xcite and this gives a  1.2% estimate of the systematic uncertainty introduced in the values of @xmath54 from the unfolding procedure . finally , we should emphasize that in order to account for the qed radiative corrections in a consistent manner we should have had these corrections implemented in the mc event generator that we use to measure the detection efficiency .",
    "we did not use such an event generator in our analysis .",
    "the efficiencies of the event selection criteria employed in our analysis are not flat over the studied @xmath76 region .",
    "most systematic errors for these efficiencies are quoted for a region of low @xmath76 ( _ i.e. _ less than @xmath170 ) where the efficiencies are smaller and the systematic uncertainties are larger than at high @xmath76 ( above @xmath170 ) .",
    "these estimates are conservative in the high @xmath76 region where a small fraction of signal events has been detected .    in the analyses of @xmath108 final states",
    "the systematic errors contribute a  5% uncertainty to the measured cross sections . as we described above",
    ", this uncertainty includes a contribution of  @xmath171 that comes from different sources for energy- and track - tagged event samples .",
    "the following subsections mainly describe the differences among the analyses of @xmath172 and @xmath173 final states and the previously described analyses of @xmath174 final states , since they share many common features .",
    "in addition to the trigger utilized for @xmath139 final states , @xmath172 and @xmath173 single - tagged events have been collected with a modified energy - based l1 trigger , which is fulfilled when the high energy shower associated with the tag candidate is found in the endcap calorimeter and two well - separated clusters , each of detected energy above 100 mev , are identified in the barrel calorimeter .",
    "this additional trigger option is especially important for @xmath175@xmath138@xmath172 and @xmath176@xmath138@xmath173 final states because few of the photons resulting from the @xmath137 decays have sufficient energy to satisfy the high - energy trigger threshold of about @xmath118 mev .",
    "each event candidate should contain a tag ( in the endcap part of the calorimeter ) , six , seven , ten or eleven photon candidates , and no charged tracks except the tag s track , if reconstructed .",
    "the efficiencies of these basic selection requirements are  30% ,  31% and  12% for the @xmath177 , @xmath167 , and @xmath178 analyses , respectively , with the reconstruction efficiency of about  @xmath141 per photon being the dominant source .    to reduce the systematic uncertainty in the trigger efficiency we select events with the most energetic photon candidate detected in the barrel calorimeter at polar angles above  @xmath112 . the trigger efficiency for these events is larger than  90% .",

    "in addition to the energy - based l1 trigger described previously , there are several track - based l1 triggers which are efficient for events with charged particles :    * the l1 `` electron '' trigger is satisfied by a high - threshold bit in the barrel calorimeter and a charged track penetrating more than halfway through the volume of the main drift chamber . * the l1 `` two - track '' trigger is efficient for events with two or more low transverse - momentum charged particles ; it requires at least two hits in either region of the tf system , two well - separated low - threshold clusters in the barrel calorimeter , and two charged tracks , each of transverse momentum above  90 mev / c .",
