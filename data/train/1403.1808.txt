    "magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) research at room temperature is driven by the future application of magnetic refrigeration as a cleaner and more energy efficient alternative to common gas compression - based cooling .",
    "the mce is characterized in terms of either an isothermal entropy change @xmath8 or an adiabatic temperature change @xmath9 and magnetic refrigerant studies typically focus on how to improve these two figures of merit .",
    "one of the principal candidate magnetic refrigerants for room temperature magnetic cooling technology is based on lafe@xmath0si@xmath1 ( lafesi ) .",
    "@xcite this material crystallizes in the cubic , nazn@xmath10-type structure and undergoes a paramagnetic ( pm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase transition at a temperature , @xmath11 , that depends on the silicon content .",
    "@xcite below a silicon content of @xmath12 , the phase transition is first order with a large mce .",
    "an itinerant electron metamagnetic transition can be induced by a magnetic field above @xmath11 but below a metamagnetic transition temperature @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite by increasing the silicon content @xmath11 increases while @xmath13 decreases and the transition becomes less first order until the metamagnetic transition line merges with the magnetic transition line at @xmath12.@xcite for @xmath14 the magnetic transition is second order with a much smaller mce and no metamagnetic transition can be found .",
    "the transition temperature ranges from 195k for @xmath15 to 245k for @xmath16 .    in order to utilize the giant mce in lafesi for magnetic cooling at room temperature",
    ", the low transition temperature needs to be overcome . although increasing the silicon content increases @xmath11 , the fm - pm transition is broadened and the mce is drastically reduced.@xcite other means of tuning @xmath11 , including the replacement of la or fe by various elements such as ce , co , ni , mn , have been tested , along with the introduction of interstitial atoms such as b , c , n and h.@xcite the most promising way of tuning @xmath11 to room temperature is currently the insertion of interstitial hydrogen because the favorable characteristics of the magnetic transition are preserved.@xcite the presence of hydrogen only increases the lattice parameters , thereby changing the exchange interaction but it changes the density of states of the 3@xmath17-bands of iron by only a small amount .",
    "* the entropy change @xmath8 and the adiabatic temperature change @xmath9 remain high while the thermomagnetic hysteresis is still small , due to the insensitivity of the electronic structure to the hydrogenation.@xcite hydrogenation increases @xmath11 from about 200k to 330k as the hydrogen content @xmath18 is varied from 0 to 1.75.@xcite    for application purposes , complete control of @xmath11 and the mce is desired . however , it has recently been discovered that the single , sharp magnetic phase transition of partially hydrogenated lafe@xmath0si@xmath1h@xmath2 ( @xmath19 ) is unstable.@xcite the transition has been seen to split into two separate transitions with distinctive @xmath11s when the material is kept close to its unsplit phase transition temperature , @xmath3 .",
    "such a split of @xmath11 implies that a diffusion of hydrogen atoms has taken place within the material , leading to hydrogen segregation and hence an inhomogeneous distribution of @xmath11s .",
    "thus far , the hydrogen diffusion has been thought to be driven by the coexistence of pm and fm magnetic phases in the vicinity of a first order @xmath11 . in the simplest model , diffusion of the hydrogen atoms would take place from the lower volume pm phase to the higher volume fm phase  @xcite since the ferromagnetic unit cell volume is about 1 to 2% larger while the symmetry of the cubic crystal structure is preserved .",
    "@xcite as a result , the @xmath11 of the pm regions @xmath20 decreases while the @xmath11 of the fm regions @xmath21 increases , stabilizing the resulting states and eventually leading to the appearance of two distinctive magnetic phase transitions .",
    "when the material is held at temperatures well above or below the initial @xmath3 the hydrogen segregation can be reversed and the initial , homogeneous state can be recovered .",
    "it has been reported that the time for this thermally activated recombination ranges from days to minutes as the recombination temperature is increased.@xcite    while the dynamics of recombination have been investigated , little has been done to investigate the timescale of the transition splitting process which is of great relevance to the efficiency of cooling cycles ( as any change in the apparent @xmath11 of a refrigerant would have a negative impact on the performance of a device.@xcite ) splitting has been reported for samples with a completed diffusion process i.e.  after keeping the sample near @xmath3 for 1 or 2 months . in this work",
    "we further investigate the dynamics of the hydrogen diffusion in lafe@xmath0si@xmath1h@xmath2 at intermediate time scales , focusing on the splitting process .",
    "all of our experiments have been conducted on a single powder sample of lafe@xmath22si@xmath23h@xmath24 with a particle size smaller than 100@xmath25 m .",
    "details of the sample preparation are given elsewhere .",
    "@xcite magnetization measurements were performed using a commercial vibrating sample magnetometer ( quantum design ppms ) .",
    "since the magnetic state of the sample strongly depends on its annealing history , the latter will be given in detail .",
    "between annealing protocols , the sample was heated well above @xmath11 , typically to 390k at 1k / min and subsequently cooled down   in the unsplit , recombined state of about 2k indicating a slight loss of about 0.03 hydrogen atoms per unit cell .",
    "the loss of hydrogen might have been thermally activated during the heating to 390k between the measurements assisted by the low pressure of about 10 mbar in the sample space . ] to reverse any previous diffusion and to ensure that the hydrogen is uniformly distributed as at this temperature the recombination speed is in the range of minutes.@xcite we hereafter call this the recombined state .",
    "the sample was cooled down to the temperature of interest , @xmath26 , and kept at @xmath26 for a period of time lasting between several hours and 3 days .",
    "subsequently the magnetization was measured from 270k to 320k with a sweep rate of 1k / min in a low magnetic field of 100oe .",
    "si@xmath23h@xmath24 taken in a magnetic field of 100oe on heating .",
    "the blue and red curves show a split state where , starting from the recombined state , the sample was kept at @xmath27k for 24h and 48h , respectively .",
    "the black curve shows the partially recombined state where , after starting from a split state , the sample was kept at 320k for 12h . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : mvst ] shows the temperature dependent magnetization and its temperature derivative for lafe@xmath22si@xmath23h@xmath24 after two splitting protocols ( @xmath27k for 24h and 48h ) and one recombination protocol ( 320k for 12h ) .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath3 of the sample in the recombined state is around 296k on heating , where @xmath11 is defined as the peak maximum of the temperature derivative . as in previous measurements of this material ,",
    "@xcite the single sharp transition decomposes on splitting into two separate transitions with two distinctive @xmath11s which corresponds to a splitting of the peak in the derivative of the magnetization . while in previous reports the `` peak splitting ''",
    "was observed after months , here we show that a significant splitting occurs after only 24 hours .",

    "the sample has been in the recombined state .",
    "the inset ( c ) shows a schematic free energy landscape at a pm - fm boundary where each minimum represents a hydrogen site .",
    "hydrogen migration across the magnetic phase boundary occurs with the hopping rates @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the corresponding activation energies . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvstime ] we show the time dependent magnetization for @xmath26 = 292k and 300k .",
    "the magnetization changes can be explained by the decomposition of @xmath3 in @xmath20 and @xmath21 due to hydrogen diffusion from the pm regions into the fm regions .",
    "@xmath20 of the pm regions shifts to lower temperatures as their hydrogen content decreases which causes their magnetization to decrease .",
    "likewise the magnetization of the fm regions increases as @xmath21 increases as they are now closer to saturation .",
    "the overall magnetization , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvstime ] , is then given by the sum of the magnetization of the pm and fm regions .",
    "for @xmath28k , which is below @xmath3 , the pm regions are predominant and the magnetization decreases . for @xmath27k , i.e.  above @xmath3 , the fm regions are predominant and the magnetization increases . the rate of the time dependent magnetization change serves as an indicator for the diffusion process although it is not a direct measurement of the diffusion rate .",
    "the magnetization in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvstime ] ( a ) and ( b ) does not follow an exponential and a physically meaningful fit was not found . to estimate the diffusion constant at room temperature we define a characteristic timescale @xmath34 as the time at which the magnetization is midway between its value at 0 and 72 hours which gives @xmath35hours .",
    "we also note that the slope of the magnetization has significantly decreased after 3 days but it has not saturated .",
    "therefore it can be assumed that there is still some ongoing diffusion .",
    "the similarity of the time constants of the 292k and 300k magnetization curves is remarkable but its origin is unclear given the complicated temperature and history dependence of the magnetization .    with a tentative characteristic timescale of @xmath35h and a characteristic magnetic domain size of @xmath36",
    "25 - 30@xmath25 m , derived from imaging experiments ,  @xcite the diffusion constant @xmath37 can be estimated by considering the diffusion equation in the two limiting cases of homogenization in an infinite periodic sample and diffusion in a semi - infinite sample.@xcite in the first case it is useful to fourier expand the concentration profile with the @xmath38th fourier component of each dimension having a time dependent amplitude of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the wavelength of the first harmonic . for a periodic concentration profile",
    "higher harmonics can be neglected and for 3 dimensions the point of half amplitude is given by @xmath41 .",
    "rearranging gives @xmath42 which leads to @xmath43m@xmath6s@xmath7 . for a semi - infinite sample",
    "the concentration profile is proportional to the error function erf@xmath44 .",
    "since erf(0.5 )  @xmath45  0.5 , the depth at which the hydrogen concentration is midway is given by @xmath46 .",
    "if we assume that for @xmath47h the depth is half the domain size @xmath48 then @xmath49 which leads to @xmath50m@xmath6s@xmath7 .",
    "for particles smaller than 100@xmath25 m the geometry of the real sample is somewhere between those two limits and so must be the diffusion constant which is then approximately @xmath4 - @xmath5m@xmath6s@xmath7 near room temperature .",
    "due to the dimension of the diffusion constant d ( length@xmath6/time ) the error or variation in the characteristic magnetic domain size dominates in comparison to the error in the characteristic timescale @xmath34 . as shown by zimm et al .",
    "@xcite the speed of the reverse process is temperature dependent and might be described by an arrhenius - type equation .",
    "it is reasonable to assume a similar temperature dependency for the peak splitting process .",
    "since the speed of diffusion is dependent on the number of unoccupied sites it can be expected that diffusion is slowest for materials close to full hydrogenation .    , 305 , 303.5 , 302 , 298 , 295 and 292k and after 2 days at @xmath27k showing the development of the two phases .",
    "the left and right black arrows indicate @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively and the gray line at 296k indicates @xmath3 . ]",
    "temperature dependent magnetization measurements were taken after keeping the recombined sample for 3 days at several values of @xmath26 around @xmath3 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdt ] as temperature derivatives of the magnetization . in the 310k curve",
    "no second peak can be distinguished and the magnetic transition looks similar to that found in the recombined state shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mvst ] . by going to lower annealing temperatures",
    "a small and broad second peak emerges with a median above 310k .",
    "this peak , corresponding to @xmath21 of the fm regions present at @xmath26 , is shifted to lower temperatures while increasing in size .",
    "the increase in size is attributed to the increasing percentage of fm regions as @xmath26 approaches @xmath3 . at lower @xmath26",
    "the fm phase becomes the majority phase and @xmath21 shifts towards @xmath3 .",
    "a similar behavior can be found for the lower temperature peak corresponding to @xmath20 of the pm regions present at @xmath26 as @xmath26 is increased . because of our definition of @xmath11 as the maximum of @xmath51 and because of the asymmetry of the transition , the annealing temperature at which the peaks of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are of the same size is not @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant @xmath26 is closer to 300k and corresponds instead to where the magnetization is halfway between its fm and pm value .",
    "the separation between the peaks is limited by the thermodynamic driving force of the diffusion .",
    "if this force is attributed to a gradient in the hydrogen concentration @xmath38 per unit cell volume @xmath52 then , in equilibrium , it must be the same in the pm and fm phase and hence @xmath53 .",
    "typical equilibrium values of the hydrogen concentration in the sample can be estimated from @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be @xmath54 and @xmath55 which gives @xmath56 .",
    "this would correspond to a 14% decrease of the volume in the pm phase compared to the fm phase whereas the experimentally determined decrease is about 1 to 2%.@xcite in the following we will show that an atomic jump process model  @xcite with different activation energies @xmath32 and @xmath33 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvstime ] ( c ) , would be a reasonable origin of the driving force .",
    "we restrict our analysis to classical thermal activation although for the lightweight hydrogen , quantum corrections can not be ruled out even at room temperature .",
    "neutron diffraction measurements on lafe@xmath0si@xmath57h@xmath58 compounds have shown that the hydrogen occupies either the 24d or 48f position inside a 2la4fe octahedron.@xcite the spontaneous magnetostriction below @xmath11 increases the la - h and fe - h distances and it is reasonable to assume that this changes the free energy of the hydrogen atom on its interstitial sites .",
    "this means that the energy barrier for a hydrogen atom jumping from a pm to a fm site , @xmath32 , is different from the energy barrier for jumping from a fm to a pm site , @xmath33 . the jump rate from the pm to the fm site , @xmath30 ,",
    "is given as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of jumps attempted per second , @xmath61 denotes the occupancy of the pm site and @xmath62 is proportional to the probability that the fm site is unoccupied .",
    "the jump rate in the opposite direction @xmath31 is defined accordingly .",
    "the principle of detailed balance states that in equilibrium the jump rates across each energy barrier are equilibrated and therefore @xmath63 .",
    "this leads to the following relation for the free energy difference @xmath64 : @xmath65 at 300k and in equilibrium ( at large @xmath66 ) the hydrogen occupations for this sample are given by @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69.@xcite the jump attempts per second @xmath60 and @xmath70 should be proportional to the debye frequency which depends only slightly on the volume and their ratio is therefore close to one . using these values the free energy difference",
    "is given as @xmath71mev .",
    "this is not incompatible with the tentatively estimated activation energy in the pm phase of 440mev.@xcite preliminary density functional theory calculations show that a hydrogenated pm phase is in equilibrium with a fm phase of higher hydrogen concentration , corroborating a free energy argument .",
    "our measurements demonstrate that the timescale of hydrogen diffusion is faster than initially reported .",
    "we have found that a significant part of the hydrogen diffusion in lafe@xmath0si@xmath1h@xmath2 happens within hours but that there are still measurable diffusion - related magnetization changes after 3 days .",
    "the diffusion constant at room temperature is estimated to be @xmath4 - @xmath5m@xmath6s@xmath7 .",
    "this is at the slow end of the diffusion of small concentrations of interstitial hydrogen in metals which typically ranges from @xmath72 to @xmath73m@xmath6/s at room temperature but it is faster than the diffusion of heavy interstitials such as c and n.@xcite we have examined the range of annealing temperatures around @xmath3 where a significant splitting of the transition can be expected and the evolution of the magnetization within this temperature window .",
    "nonetheless a large thermodynamic driving force is present in the two - phase region around @xmath3 .",
    "the origin of this force may be explained by a free energy difference of the hydrogen atoms in the pm and fm unit cell rather than solely by the pm - fm volume change .",
