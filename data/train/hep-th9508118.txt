    "ambiguities appearing in higher loops are inevitable , because they relate to the regularization ambiguity of the integration measure @xmath93 , which has never been defined rigorously in the first place .",
    "both methods we have presented here reveal that the degree of ambiguity gets larger as the order of loops increases . in the analytic continuation method ,",
    "ambiguity arises from the variety of the analytic continuation applicable to the multiple infinite summation , whereas in the distribution method , the delta - function integration , particularly the finite part of the boundary contribution , is the source of the ambiguity .",
    "nevertheless our lower order calculations suggest that by regularizing @xmath93 order by order , one can eliminate all higher loop corrections , and thereby preserving the duistermaat - heckman formula .",
    "the symplectic structure has been studied thoroughly in compact finite dimensional manifolds , but little is known for the infinite dimensional ones , which include most of the integrable hierarchies .",
    "this is exactly the place where the physical interests are , and the duistermaat - heckman formula would throw a new light over the integrable hierarchies as we have caught a glimpse of it here .",
