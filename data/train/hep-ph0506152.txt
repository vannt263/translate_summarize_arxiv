    "the data on rare decays from cleo , babar , belle and tevatron hold promise for deepening our understanding of the interplay between flavour - changing and qcd dynamics . in particular , the surprise regarding the @xmath0 amplitude ,",
    "existing already for considerable time @xcite , calls for an explanation .",
    "namely , the branching ratio for the decay mode @xmath11 is measured to be almost six times bigger than the one for @xmath12 , although the same basic @xmath13 penguin mechanism is expected to drive both processes .",
    "apparently , this mechanism may have a different appearance when instead of the flavour octet pion there is an ( almost ) flavour singlet @xmath3 particle involved .",
    "it is well known that some extraordinary properties of the @xmath3 particle are related to the qcd anomaly .",
    "therefore , a suggestion to explain the enhancement of the @xmath0 amplitude by the qcd anomaly at first sight looks very intriguing @xcite .",
    "our preceding investigation in this direction found that the @xmath14 amplitude in the hard gluon regime represents a well defined short distance ( sd ) mechanism @xcite , but of minor numerical importance for the process at hand .",
    "the inability of this sd mechanism to account for the measured amplitude invites us to explore here the complementary long - distance ( ld ) mechanism .",
    "there are conclusions in the literature @xcite that the `` singlet penguin '' amplitude ( in the language of su(3 ) diagrammatic approach @xcite ) contributes substantially to the @xmath0 enhancement .",
    "one of the purposes of this note is to investigate this from another angle than done previously , i. e. to identify the singlet penguin contribution and estimate it within the well - defined microscopic dynamical framework .    in order to deal with the low energy properties of some of the involved gluons and to calculate the physical @xmath0 amplitude",
    ", we have to introduce an appropriate low - energy description .",
    "we will employ ideas based on the chiral quark model ( @xmath15qm)@xcite which has been used to describe @xmath16 decays @xcite . here",
    "we will rely on the extension of such models , namely the heavy - light chiral quark model ( hl@xmath15qm ) @xcite which has , as the @xmath15qm , turned out to be a convenient calculational tool for addressing soft - gluon contributions , that can be expressed in terms of gluon condensate effects @xcite .",
    "one should note that when the quarks and soft gluons in the hl@xmath15qm are integrated out , one obtains standard heavy light chiral perturbation theory ( hl@xmath15pt ) @xcite .",
    "the hl@xmath15qm has been applied to @xmath17 mixing @xcite and to decays of the type @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to the decay mode @xmath19 @xcite which has similar aspects as the mode we consider in this paper . in principle",
    ", the hl@xmath15qm naturally accounts only for soft kaons in the final state .",
    "however , as we show in the next section , assuming the general form of the relevant form factor enables one to perform extrapolation from the soft to the hard kaon case .",
    "the ld mechanism that we propose for the @xmath0 decay is shown in figure  [ bketagg ] .",
    "it accounts for the contribution obtained when a soft gluon ( @xmath21 ) is emitted from the @xmath22 transition together with the virtual gluon ( @xmath23 ) associated with the penguin @xmath24 transition .",
    "in addition , one of the gluons ( @xmath25 ) in the @xmath26 vertex in figure  [ bketagg ] is also assumed to be soft , so that two soft gluons form a vacuum condensate .",
    "the remaining off - shell gluon from the @xmath27 penguin is propagating into the @xmath3 .    a mechanism for @xmath28 due to soft gluons .",
    "the crosses correspond to the gluon condensate . ]    now , the @xmath29 vertex denoted by a large circle in figure  [ bketagg ] can be calculated in the soft @xmath30 limit within the hl@xmath15qm , as displayed in figure  [ bkggst ] .    to begin with it ,",
    "let us recall that the involved vector current form factors in heavy quark physics are defined by @xmath31              & = f_{b}(q^2 ) m_{b } v^{\\mu } + f_{k}(q^2 ) p_{k}^\\mu \\ ; , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 in the @xmath33 limit , @xmath34 dominates , as it can be seen from the scaling properties @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "in addition , considering the soft @xmath30 limit within heavy - light chiral perturbation theory ( hl@xmath15pt ) @xcite , @xmath34 is dominated by the @xmath37 pole , and is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the coefficients determined by qcd renormalization of the weak heavy - light current @xcite .",
    "the soft @xmath30 limit is of course unphysical in our case , and to overcome this we employ a double pole structure @xmath42 such a structure , proposed in @xcite , seems to fit very well the existing data and the theoretical requirements on the heavy - light vector form factor , for , say , @xmath43 , and some parameter @xmath44 fitting @xmath45 . to determine @xmath44 we observe that ( [ doublepole ] ) in our limits reads @xmath46 so that a comparison with ( [ bpolefk ] ) gives @xmath47 which is general within hl@xmath15pt . knowing the value for @xmath48 , @xmath44 can be determined .",
    "we will use the result of the qcd sum rules on the light - cone analysis , @xmath49 @xcite , implying @xmath50 , in agreement with lattice fits @xcite .",
    "thus , extrapolating from the soft @xmath30 to the general case we obtain the substitution rule @xmath51    below we will assume that the form factor for the @xmath29 vertex also has the dipole form ( [ doublepole ] ) , because of @xmath37 pole dominance in both cases .",
    "this assumption will hold within hl@xmath15pt in the region where it is valid .",
    "therefore we will adopt the rule ( [ extrapolation ] ) also for the @xmath29 form factor .",
    "for this case , the position of the second pole might be somewhat different , which means that @xmath44 and @xmath52 in ( [ lambdafromfk ] ) should be replaced by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .    the @xmath55 penguin operator at the quark level is @xmath56 where @xmath57 means a covariant derivative , and @xmath58 for the quantity @xmath59 we take the one loop result @xcite , @xmath60 .",
    "this result might be slightly changed by perturbative qcd effects like in @xcite for @xmath61 , but we do not enter such details here .",
    "@xmath62 in the soft kaon limit .",
    "the black box denotes the @xmath27 penguin transition . ]",
    "note that the contribution of the _ dipole _ penguin operator @xmath63 is suppressed by the small form factor @xmath64 , and we neglect it .",
    "the bosonization of the coloured quark current in ( [ peng ] ) with emission of an additional soft gluon is known @xcite , @xmath65\\bigg\\ } \\ ; , \\label{btog}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the heavy meson `` superfield '' @xcite and @xmath67 , with @xmath68 being the standard goldstone boson @xmath69 matrix field .",
    "furthermore , @xmath70 is the meson - quark coupling given by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 gev is the constituent light quark mass , @xmath73 is a hadronic parameter @xcite and @xmath74 is the axial coupling of goldstone bosons to heavy mesons . moreover , within the hl@xmath15qm we find @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a logarithmically divergent loop integral which is expressed in terms of @xmath77 and the gluon condensate @xcite , as follows @xmath78 it should be noted that the structure in ( [ btog ] ) should be rather general , while @xmath70 and the explicit expressions for @xmath79 are model dependent .    taking the vector ( @xmath80 ) part of the @xmath81 and connecting with the @xmath37 propagator in figure  [ bkggst ]",
    ", we obtain in the soft @xmath30 limit the amplitude @xmath82    \\quad\\times \\big\\ { -(a_1+a_2)\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta } +   2 a_2 v^\\mu \\epsilon^{\\lambda\\nu\\alpha\\beta}v_\\lambda   \\big\\ } \\;.",
    "\\label{softamp}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in order to obtain the general amplitude for @xmath29 from this equation , we perform the substitution ( [ extrapolation ] ) for @xmath83 in the denominator above with @xmath84 replaced by @xmath85 .",
    "concerning the @xmath86 interaction , it has the general form already used in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath87 and several groups @xcite calculated the form - factor @xmath88 in the perturbative qcd approach . since this approach becomes unreliable for gluon momenta of @xmath89 gev , we adopt a formula from @xcite which interpolates between the perturbative qcd region and the anomaly value for zero momentum .",
    "this formula gives @xmath90 gev@xmath91 , where an error of 25 % has been allowed .",
    "accordingly , together with the value of the gluon condensate , this is the major source of uncertainty in our result below .",
    "taking now the vacuum expectation value of the two soft gluons @xmath92 we obtain the final amplitude @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "numerically , with @xmath95 , @xmath96 gev , and @xmath97 given by the numbers below eq .",
    "( [ lambdafromfk ] ) , we get @xmath98 it should be noted , that even if the uncertainty of @xmath44 is increased to 50 % when replaced by @xmath53 , it has no significant impact on the form factor @xmath85 at the physical point @xmath99 , and thereby not on the final result ( [ eight ] ) .",
    "this means that our assumption for the form factor @xmath85 should be rather sound .    our result ( [ eight ] ) should be compared to the experimental amplitude @xmath100 gev",
    "thus , according to our analysis , only of order 10@xmath101 of the @xmath28 rate enhancement can be ascribed to this gluonic creation of @xmath3 .",
    "some additional mechanisms are necessary , such as constructive interference of amplitudes for creating @xmath3 in @xmath102 and @xmath103 state @xcite . however , the gluonic mechanism studied here , with its distinctive flavour - singlet nature , seems to go in the direction of the result of the su(3 ) symmetry analysis in @xcite that shows a substantial singlet penguin contribution to @xmath28 amplitude .",
    "let us comment here on how our result fits into the existing accounts of joining the two - gluon configurations arising from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 transitions with those inherent to the @xmath3 particle , in particular on those relying on properties of the @xmath3 particle that are related to the qcd anomaly .",
    "the attempts to explain some puzzling hadronic weak decays by qcd anomalies are well known : the @xmath104 enhancement in @xmath105 by the trace anomaly @xcite and the enhancement of @xmath106 decay rates by the axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "we entered such study by employing the fact that anomaly permeates all distance scales , that enables one to study the role of two - gluon anomalous configurations from an extreme sd to a truly ld regime .",
    "our recent study @xcite shows that there is merely a remnant , the anomaly tail , in the extreme sd case .",
    "it should be noted that this contribution is obtained as a two quark operator for @xmath107 and is very different from the ld contribution presented in detail in the previous section .",
    "in addition , we have also identified some other contributions which we have found to be negligible .",
    "for example , fritzsch @xcite has suggested that an effective interaction of the form @xmath108 might contribute significantly .",
    "we will describe elsewhere @xcite different perturbative and nonperturbative contributions to such an effective interaction stemming from anomalous two - gluon configurations .",
    "note that already a rotation of an appropriate term from simma and wyler s paper @xcite to fritzsch s form enables one to read off a perturbative contribution to coefficient @xmath109 above , @xmath110 , which gives an amplitude 34 times smaller than ( [ eight ] ) .    after observing a systematic suppression of the anomalous two - gluon contributions through",
    "all the distance scales @xcite , we are focusing in the present paper to ld nonperturbative gluon configurations that may be phenomenologically more relevant .",
    "thereby we are considering the low energy contribution where a gluon condensate accounts for the emission of soft gluons . a priori , our calculation would only be valid in the unphysical case where the outgoing kaon is soft .",
    "however , one can extrapolate to the physical point by introducing a dipole form factor for the @xmath111 transition ( as for the standard @xmath112 transition current ) . as a result we find a more significant contribution from this mechanism , which can account for @xmath113 of the measured amplitude .",
    "this result has to be compared with findings of @xcite that flavour singlet contributions to @xmath28 may be marginal .",
    "however , due to quite large uncertainties in both amplitudes these two results are actually not inconsistent .",
    "note that the major portion of the singlet penguin amplitude in @xcite comes from the operators corresponding to singlet quark configurations forming @xmath3 particle .",
    "recently another analysis within scet appeared @xcite .",
    "this analysis concludes that the `` singlet penguin '' contribution is essential to understand the process @xmath114 .",
    "unfortunately , a direct comparison between our treatment of one soft ( @xmath115 ) and one semi - hard ( @xmath116 ) gluon and the one by scet is difficult to perform .",
    "anyway , our contribution corresponding to the gluonic configurations forming the gluon condensate is a novel one , and may significantly increase the role of the singlet penguin mechanism in the direction of the result based on the su(3 ) symmetry analysis @xcite .",
    "a number of authors already used the surprising @xmath28 enhancement to infer on the contributions beyond the standard model .",
    "however , at this stage we need first to consider possible contributions from the specific mechanisms within the standard model , like the one presented here .",
    "this mechanism seems to provide an additional contribution to the singlet penguin topology , the understanding of which may be of importance for explaining the data on cp asymmetries in penguin dominated modes @xcite .",
