    "the lmc is a widely studied nearby extragalactic setting with a plethora of stellar tracers .",
    "the closeness of the lmc and the abundance of tracers has resulted in a large number of distance measurements to this nearby galaxy . as the lmc distance provides an important low rung of the cosmological distance ladder , it is of great interest to study collections of lmc distance moduli measurements .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite compiled a list of 237 lmc distance moduli published during 1990 - 2014 and used these data to examine the effects of publication bias and correlation between the measurements .",
    "they conclude that the overall effect of publication bias is not strong , although there are significant effects due to measurement correlations , especially in some individual tracer ( smaller ) subsamples .    in this paper",
    "we extend and complement the analysis of @xcite by constructing and studying the error distributions of the full ( 232 measurements ) sample and two individual tracer subsamples of the @xcite compilation .",
    "more specifically , we examine the gaussianity of these error distributions .",
    "we begin by following @xcite and @xcite and construct an error distribution , a histogram of measurements as a function of @xmath3 , the number of standard deviations that a measurement deviates from a central estimate .",
    "this is similar to the z score analysis of @xcite , however , we use a central estimate from the data compilation itself whereas @xcite use two published values that are assumed to well represent the measurements .",
    "we use two techniques to find the central estimate : weighted mean and median statistics . since median statistics does not make use of individual measurement error bars , median statistics constraints are typically weaker than weighted mean ones , but are more reliable in the presence of unaccounted - for systematic errors .",
    "we find larger probability tails ( error ) in the weighted mean distributions .",
    "for the median 232 measurements case , we find that the distribution is narrower than a gaussian distribution at small ( intermediate ) @xmath4 where the probability is higher ( lower ) than expected for a gaussian distribution ( a similar effect is seen in the smaller sub - samples we study ) .",
    "we attempt to analytically categorize these distributions by fitting to well - known non - gaussian distributions : cauchy , student s @xmath5 , and the double exponential . using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test",
    ", the fits are poor ( @xmath6 ) for the cauchy , and double exponential cases .",
    "a student s @xmath5 case with a @xmath7 gives a probability of 21@xmath8 , and is the best fit .",
    "given that the weighted mean error distributions are significantly non - gaussian , it is proper to focus more on our median statistics central estimate results . in this case , for all three data sets , the error distributions are narrower than gaussian .",
    "this could be the result of mild publication bias , or more likely , as argued by @xcite , the consequence of correlations between measurements .    in section [ methods ]",
    "we summarize our methods of graphically and numerically describing the error distribution of the distance moduli values .",
    "section [ all ] describes our findings from analyses of the distribution of all 232 measurements .",
    "sections [ cepheids ] and [ lyrae ] summarize our analyses of the two individual tracer subsamples . in section [ smc ]",
    "we describe the results found using smc distance moduli measurements from @xcite .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "of the 237 lmc distance moduli values collected by @xcite , five do not have a quoted error . for our analyses here we use the 232 measurements with symmetric statistical error bars . to determine the error distribution of the 232 measurements we must first find a central estimate .",
    "we do this using two statistical techniques : weighted mean and median statistics .",
    "the weighted mean @xcite is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance modulus and @xmath11 is the one standard deviation error of @xmath12 measurements . while @xcite use only the quoted statistical error , in our analyses @xmath11 is the quadrature sum of the systematic ( if quoted ) and statistical errors . since many do not quote a systematic error , . ] and if one is stated it is small , the difference is not large .",
    "the weighted mean standard deviation is @xmath13 we can also determine a goodness of fit , @xmath14 , by @xmath15 the number of standard deviations that @xmath16 deviates from unity is a measure of good - fit and is given by    @xmath17    the median statistics technique is beneficial because it does not make use of the individual measurement errors .",
    "however , consequently , this will result in a larger uncertainty on the central estimate than for the weighted mean case . to use median statistics we assume that all measurements are statistically independent and",
    "have no systematic error as a whole .",
    "a measurement then has a @xmath18 chance of either being below or above the median value . for a detailed description of median statistics",
    "see @xcite .",
    "once a central estimate is found , we can construct an error distribution using @xmath3 defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the central estimate of @xmath21 , either @xmath22 or @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the error of the central estimate , either @xmath25 or @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 is the median distance modulus , with @xmath18 of the measurements being above it and @xmath18 below , and @xmath26 is defined as in @xcite such that the range @xmath28 includes @xmath29 of the probability .",
    "@xcite consider a similar variable , a  z score \" .",
    "their z score is different in that they use two reference values for their central estimate ( @xcite and @xcite ) while we use the weighted mean and median central estimates .",
    "@xcite assume that the reference values are a good representation of the distance moduli measurements .",
    "therefore they use the z score assuming gaussianity .",
    "we do not assume gaussianity as our central estimates are found directly from the collected @xcite data using our statistical techniques .",
    "to numerically describe the error distribution , we use a nonparametric kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) analysis .",
    "this is used to test the compatibility of a sample distribution to a reference distribution .",
    "this can be used in two ways , with binned or un - binned data .",
    "the test compares the lmc distance moduli measurements to a well know distribution function .",
    "to set conventions , we first use the gaussian probability distribution function is @xmath30 it will also be of interest to consider other well - known distributions .",
    "these include the cauchy ( or lorentzian ) distribution @xmath31 this distribution has extended tails , and is a popular choice for a widened distribution compared to the gaussian .",
    "the cauchy distribution has large extended tails with an expected @xmath29 and @xmath32 of the values falling within @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the student s @xmath5 distribution is described by @xmath35}{\\sqrt{\\pi n}\\gamma(n/2)}\\frac{1}{(1+|\\textbf{x}|^{2}/n)^{(n+1)/2}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath36 is a positive parameter , reduces the number of degrees of freedom by 1 . ] and @xmath37 is the gamma function . when @xmath38 this becomes the gaussian distribution . when @xmath39 it is the cauchy distribution .",
    "thus , for @xmath40 , it is a function with extended tails , but less so than that of the cauchy distribution .",
    "the last distribution that we consider is the double exponential .",
    "this is given by @xmath41 the double exponential falls off less rapidly than a gaussian distribution , but faster than a cauchy distribution .",
    "for this distribution @xmath29 and @xmath32 of the values fall within @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the comparison between the sample and assumed distribution yields a p - value ( or probability ) that the two are of the same distribution .",
    "when using weighted mean statistics , the 232 lmc distance moduli yield a central estimate of @xmath44 mag .",
    "we also find @xmath45 and the number of standard deviations that @xmath16 deviates from unity is @xmath46 .",
    "for the median case we find a central estimate of @xmath47 mag with a @xmath1 range of @xmath48 mag @xmath49 mag .",
    "our central estimates are in good accord with @xcite who quote @xmath50 mag .",
    "figure [ figure : nsig ] shows the error distribution of the 232 measurements .",
    "these are shown as a function of @xmath3 , eq .",
    "[ nsig ] , the number of standard deviations the measured value deviates from the central estimate . in fig .",

    "[ figure : prob ] ( with @xmath52 bin size ) .",
    "figure [ figure : nsig ] shows that for the weighted mean case the distribution has a more extended tail than expected for a gaussian distribution .",
    "in fact , for a set of 232 values , a gaussian distribution should yield 11 values with @xmath53 , one value with @xmath54 , and none with @xmath55 . however , we find 42 values with @xmath53 , 23 with @xmath54 and nine with @xmath55 for the weighted mean case",
    ". we also note that @xmath29 of the observed weighted mean @xmath3 error distribution falls within @xmath56 while @xmath32 lies within @xmath57 .",
    "the observed weighted mean @xmath51 error distribution has limits of @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the values fall within @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the weighted mean error distribution is non - gaussian and so the weighted mean technique is inappropriate for an analysis of these data .",
    "the median case is narrower than gaussian , with seven values of @xmath53 and none with @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath29 of the data falls within @xmath64 while @xmath32 lies within @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath51 error distribution has limits of @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the values fall within @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the median technique is more appropriate because of the non - gaussianity of the distributions , however , @xcite note that there are correlations between measurements ( especially among measurements of the same tracer type ) .",
    "these correlations mean that the measurements are not statistically independent , and the errors associated with the median will need to be slightly adjusted to account for this .",
    "regardless , the narrowness of the median distribution is clearly consistent with the presence of such correlations .    since the distribution for the weighted mean case is broader than gaussian while the median distribution is narrower than a gaussian , it is of interest to try to fit these observed distributions to well - known non - gaussian distributions .    to set conventions , we first consider a gaussian probability distribution function . in this case @xmath29 of the values",
    "have @xmath70 .",
    "the gaussianity of the distribution can be established by taking a quantitative look at the spread of values . however , the probability given by the ks test is @xmath71% for the data set ( see table [ table : ks ] ) .",
    "our first non - gaussian distribution , the cauchy ( or lorentzian ) distribution , also has a probability of @xmath6 .",
    "next we consider a distribution with extended tails , but less so than the cauchy distribution , the student s @xmath5 distribution .",
    "fitting to this function yields a probability of @xmath72 ( corresponding to a student s @xmath5 distribution with @xmath7 ) for a binned ks test .",
    "this may appear odd , as we have argued that for the median case the distribution is narrower than a gaussian distribution , while the student s @xmath5 distribution is known for extended tails .",
    "to explain this we examine the kurtosis of the @xmath51 distribution .",
    "we use the common definition of kurtosis ( see eq .",
    "37.8b of @xcite ) @xmath73 where the fourth and second moments are @xmath74 and @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the mean of the @xmath36 @xmath77 values . for a detailed discussion of kurtosis see @xcite .",
    "the kurtosis can be defined as a measurement of the peakedness , or that of the tail width of a distribution .",
    "for example , a large kurtosis would represent a distribution with more probability in the peak and tails than in the `` shoulder '' @xcite .",
    "a gaussian distribution has @xmath78 , and @xmath79 represents a leptokurtic distribution with a high peak and wide tail . for the median case , we find @xmath80 .",
    "this may explain why this case favors a student s @xmath5 fit , as a student s @xmath5 distribution also has a large kurtosis , i.e. wider tails and a higher peak .",
    "the median statistics distribution appears to favor this fit because its kurtosis is greater than that for a gaussian distribution , even though it is narrower than a gaussian .",
