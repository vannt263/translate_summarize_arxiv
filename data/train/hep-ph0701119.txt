    "another class of neutron stars was discovered at x - ray and @xmath5-ray energies and may possess even stronger surface magnetic fields @xmath6  g. such stars are now referred to as magnetars @xcite , since they most probably derive their power from their magnetic fields rather than from spin - down energy loss .",
    "two different classes of objects are thought to be magnetars : the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) , discovered as sources of short bursts of hard x - rays ( @xmath7 kev ) with super - eddington luminosity and the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( aps ) , discovered as persistent , soft ( @xmath8 kev ) x- ray sources with pulsations of several seconds and spinning - down on time scales of @xmath9 years .",
