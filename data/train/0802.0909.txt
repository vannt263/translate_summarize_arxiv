    "the single band , two dimensional hubbard hamiltonian provides one possible microscopic model for pairing which is driven by electronic correlations rather than the interactions of electrons with the lattice .",
    "many analytic and numeric @xcite treatments suggest that there may indeed be a superconducting phase at low temperature away from half - filling in this model .",
    "the issue is a difficult one , however , owing to the likely existence of a variety of different phases which are close in energy on the one hand , and the nature of the approximations made in the solution on the other .",
    "exact diagonalization studies @xcite , while very useful , are typically on lattices of only a few tens of sites , and hence finite size effects are a considerable concern .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , which can in principle address the issue in an unbiased way ( on lattices an order of magnitude or more larger than diagonalization ) has been unable to access sufficiently low temperatures due to the ` minus sign problem ' @xcite .",
    "recently , progress has been made using improved numerical methods .",
    "the ` density matrix renormalization group ' has pushed forward from one dimension to address geometries of many coupled chains@xcite .",
    "the dynamic cluster approximation has improved on dynamical mean field treatments by showing the robustness of a finite temperature transition to a superconducing state as an increasingly fine momentum grid is incorporated in the self - energy @xcite . nevertheless , there is still numeric work which contests the conclusion that the two dimensional hubbard hamiltonian has long range @xmath0-wave pair correlations@xcite .    in this paper , we present determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) calculations of a bilayer hubbard model for which we are able to attain much lower temperatures than the single layer case .",
    "specifically , by doping the two layers symmetrically about half - filling , @xmath5 , we find that the sign problem is greatly reduced , allowing simulations at temperatures which are roughly two orders of magnitude below the bandwidth , @xmath6 . in single layer simulations of the doped system ,",
    "the lowest attainable temperatures are @xmath7 .",
    "previous dqmc studies of bilayer models have looked at the case when both layers are half - filled , and examined magnetic order - disorder transitions which occur as the interlayer hopping is increased @xcite .",
    "a decreasing interlayer hopping monotonically reduces the pairing correlations in this situation .",
    "our work is partially motivated by studies of ba@xmath1ca@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4f@xmath1 and ba@xmath1ca@xmath1cu@xmath3o@xmath8f@xmath1 which are an experimental realization of materials in which electron and hole doped sheets coexist within the family of cuprate superconductors @xcite . in the former , four - layered compound ,",
    "the two outer planes are electron - doped with @xmath9 , while the two inner planes are hole doped roughly symetrically , that is @xmath10 .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature is @xmath11 k , and pairing coexists with long range antiferromagnetic order with nel temperature @xmath12 k. the latter , three - layered compound has outer plane doping @xmath13 , but a larger inner plane doping @xmath14 .",
    "its superconducting @xmath15k with only short range antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "this is attributed to a decoupling of the magnetism of the electron doped outer planes by the large doping of the inner plane @xcite .    0.2 in",
    "in order to model such materials , we consider the two layer hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath16 the first term is the usual hopping of electrons between near neighbor sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 of a two dimensional square lattice . unless otherwise stated , the results in this paper are for two coupled 8x8 lattices .",
    "the electrons in the kinetic energy term have a spin index @xmath19 and also a layer index @xmath20 .",
    "the second term is an interlayer hopping .",
    "the third term is a layer - dependent chemical potential .",
    "we will choose @xmath21 to produce layers which have opposite dopings .",
    "finally , electrons of opposite spin on the same site of the same layer feel a repulsion @xmath22 .",
    "our simulations employ the dqmc algorithm @xcite in which a path integral is written for the partition function , the fermion interactions are replaced by a coupling to an auxiliary hubbard - stratonovich field , and then the fermion degrees of freedom are integrated out analytically .",
    "the method produces exact results on the lattice sizes considered , apart from ` trotter ' errors associated with the imaginary time discretization , which we have verified are smaller than our statistical error bars .",
    "the magnetic properties are determined from the spin - spin correlations , @xmath23 which are independent of layer index @xmath24 because of our choice of symmetric doping and the particle - hole symmetry of the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the fourier transform gives the structure factor , @xmath25 at half - filling , @xmath26 is largest at the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath27 .",
    "a first insight into the metal - insulator transition can be obtained from the zero momentum spectral function ( density of states ) @xmath28 which is determined from the greens function , @xmath29 using the maximum entropy method @xcite .",
    "the dc conductivity @xmath30 also characterizes the metal - insulator transition , and is measured from the current - current correlation function , @xmath31 this imaginary time quantity , which comes directly out of the determinant qmc simulations , is related to the real frequency response by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath32 as discussed in [ ] , at sufficiently low temperatures we can replace @xmath33 by its low frequency behavior @xmath34 , leading to the relation , @xmath35 this enables us to obtain the conductivity directly from the imaginary time response without the necessity for analytic continuation , which is more difficult for two particle response functions , like the current - current correlator , than for the single particle greens function , owing to their larger fluctuations .    to describe superconductivity ,",
    "we compute the correlated pair field susceptibility , @xmath36 , in different symmetry channels , @xmath37    the correlated susceptibility @xmath38 takes the expectation value of the product of the four fermion operators entering eq .",
    "we also define the uncorrelated pair field susceptibility @xmath39 which instead computes the expectation values of pairs of operators _ prior _ to taking the product .",
    "thus , for example , in the @xmath40-wave channel , @xmath41 @xmath38 includes both the renormalization of the propagation of the individual fermions as well as the interaction vertex between them , whereas @xmath39 includes only the former effect .",
    "indeed by evaluating both @xmath42 and @xmath43 we are able to extract @xcite the interaction vertex @xmath44 , @xmath45 if @xmath46 , the associated pairing interaction is attractive .",

    "nevertheless there is an interesting competition between mott insulating behavior when @xmath22 is the dominant energy scale , and band insulating behavior for large @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , increased interlayer coupling suppresses the antiferromagnetic correlations which are present in the mott phase , since @xmath51 promotes the formation of interlayer singlets between the two spatial sites immediately above and below each other .",

    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the lowest accessible temperature in the latter case is @xmath99 . at the same @xmath100 and doping @xmath101 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ gammadvst ] , the bilayer system has a somewhat more negative @xmath102 .",
    "thus the approach of @xmath91 to @xmath103 seen in the bilayer system is due both to a more attractive pairing vertex , but also due to the ability of the simulation to reach much colder temperatures .",
    "although we find the vertex @xmath91 approaches -1 , this criterion for an instability is incomplete .",
    "one also needs to require that the uncorrelated susceptibility @xmath104 remain finite at the transition point .",
    "especially in the situation where there is competing order ( e.g. antiferromagnetism and pairing ) it is possible for the uncorrelated susceptibility of one type of order to be driven to small values by the other order , so that even though the vertex approaches -1 , order in this channel is usurped .",

    "an interesting feature of figs .",
    "[ gammadvst ] and [ pdvst ] is that the @xmath0-wave attraction is maximal at @xmath93 , whether measured via the vertex or the correlated susceptibility .",
    "this point is made more concretely in fig .",
    "[ gammadvsrho ] .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath0-wave superconducting vertex bears an interesting resemblance to the superconducting  domes \" of the cuprate materials in which the transition temperatures are maximized a finite distance away from  half - filling \" ( one hole per cu ) . indeed , even the values of the doping which maximizes @xmath107 and the width of the base of the dome are in reasonable quantitative agreement .",
    "it is to be emphasized that , within the same dqmc methodology , the single layer hubbard model has a maximum pairing vertex at half - filling .",
    "[ gammadvsrho ] also indicates that , within the parameter range accessible , the degree of enhancement increases as @xmath51 decreases .",
    "eventually we expect this trend to reverse , since at @xmath66 , the single layer model , there is a lesser tendency for pairing .",
    "( we can not accumulate data for smaller values of @xmath51 because the sign problem prevents simulations at as low a temperature as for the data shown . )",

    "why is the sign problem ameliorated in these bilayer simulations ?",
    "in dqmc for the single layer hamiltonian , the operator @xmath119 couples to the hubbard stratonovich field @xmath120 @xcite shifted by the chemical potential @xmath121 . meanwhile , @xmath122 couples to @xmath123 . at half - filling ,",
    "@xmath124 , particle - hole symmetry is reflected in the fact that the up and down species couple to the quantities @xmath125 which are symmetric about zero .",
    "the up and down determinants can be shown to have the same sign , and hence their product is positive .",
    "for @xmath126 this symmetry and the associated connection between the signs of the two determinants is broken , and a sign problem results .",

    "what we observe is that , to the extent that the hubbard - stratonovich variables on the two layers are equal , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are symmetrically coupled about zero .",
    "it is possible that this tends to lead to a positive determinant product similar to the single layer case at half - filling .",
    "of course , there is no constraint that @xmath139 , but we suspect that they are nevertheless sufficiently correlated to reduce the sign problem .",
    "in this paper we have used dqmc simulations to determine the phase diagram , in the @xmath140 plane , of the half - filled bilayer hubbard model .",
    "our phase diagram exhibits metallic , band insulating and mott insulating phases in qualitative agreement with cdmft results@xcite .",
    "however , the entire metallic phase we find is paramagnetic with no antiferromagnetic metallic regions .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the doped bilayer hubbard hamiltonian has an attractive @xmath0-wave pairing vertex which approaches close to @xmath141 , signaling a superconducting transition .",
    "this value is much more singular than that observed in the single layer model , partly because it is more attractive when compared at the same inverse temperature , and partly because it is possible to simulate to values of @xmath70 which are two to three times larger than for a single plane .",
    "however , the uncorrelated @xmath106 gets small , so that the enhancement of the correlated @xmath105 is not very dramatic . on the other hand , and unlike what happens in the single layer @xmath142 hubbard model , the enhancement here is maximum when the system is doped , in agreement with the phenomenology of cuprate superconductors .",
    "pairing in systems with separate electron and hole doped sheets has a long history in the context of exciton condensation @xcite , but our primary motivation here has been the recent report of cuprate - based systems ba@xmath1ca@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4f@xmath1 and ba@xmath1ca@xmath1cu@xmath3o@xmath8f@xmath1 which have both types of dopings @xcite .",
    "our results for the magnetic and pairing correlations bear interesting connections to those materials . while the bilayer simulations reported here contain the the essential feature of coupled electron and hole doped layers , it is natural to consider direct numerics of three and four layer compounds .",
    "such studies will require an order of magnitude greater simulation time , and also have an at present unknown sign problem .",
    "in general the sign problem becomes worse with lattice size ( and hence with number of layers ) , but it is tempting to speculate that , if the above picture of correlated determinant signs presented above is correct , similar correlations might provide protection for larger numbers of layers .",
