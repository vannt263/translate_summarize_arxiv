    "these colorings are known to have a simple and pleasing structure , which we review and elaborate in section [ sec : gallcliq ] .",

    "the structural results make it possible to characterize , in section [ sec : fullhom ] , the monochromes , i.e. , the components of the monochromatic subgraphs .",
