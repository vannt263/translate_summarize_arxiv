    "decays of @xmath0 mesons into two charmless mesons provide an abundant source of information on flavour- and cp - violating phenomena in the weak interactions of quarks . in particular",
    ", decays to two vector mesons ( @xmath4 ) can shed light on the helicity structure of these interactions through polarization studies . while predicted to be fundamentally v - a in the standard model ( sm ) , a deviation from this expectation can not currently be excluded .",
    "the first observations of @xmath4 decays show no anomalies in the helicity structure , but point to a reduced amount of longitudinal polarization in penguin - dominated decays  @xcite .",
    "this has led to theoretical studies that reconsider strong interactions effects in @xmath4 decays  @xcite , or invoke new fundamental interactions  @xcite .",
    "any particular @xmath4 decay is characterized by the three helicity amplitudes @xmath5 ( longitudinal ) , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . a quark model or naive factorization analysis  @xcite leads to the expectation that for @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9-quark , decay the helicity amplitudes are in proportions @xmath10 with @xmath11gev the strong interaction scale and @xmath12gev the bottom quark mass",
    ". this expectation has been parametrically ( not necessarily numerically ) confirmed  @xcite in the framework of qcd factorization , which provides a theoretical basis for the heavy - quark expansion of @xmath0 decays to charmless mesons  @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy ( [ hierarchy ] ) of helicity amplitudes follows from the v - a structure of the standard weak interactions .    in this letter",
    "we point out and discuss an effect which has been neglected in all previous studies of @xmath4 , but which substantially alters the prediction for polarization observables .",
    "the effect is connected with electromagnetic penguin transitions , and appears only for neutral vector mesons .",
    "it leads to the unique feature that the transverse electroweak penguin amplitude is dominated by the electromagnetic dipole operator providing a signature similar to polarization in radiative decays @xmath13  @xcite , but which is easier to access experimentally .",
    "the effect in question is related to the two diagrams shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "when the vector meson @xmath14 is transversely polarized , there exists a large contribution to the decay amplitude due to the small virtuality @xmath15 of the intermediate photon propagator .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of longitudinal polarization , where the photon propagator is canceled , and the amplitude is local on the scale @xmath16  @xcite . the large transverse amplitude is best described by a short - distance transition @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , followed by the transition of the low - virtuality photon ( @xmath19 ) to the neutral vector meson .",
    "we shall perform a factorization analysis of the amplitude below .",
    "the calculation of the diagrams in figure  [ fig1 ] is straightforward .",
    "the weak interactions are given in terms of the standard effective hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "we use the conventions of  @xcite , but generalize the electromagnetic dipole operators to include both chiralities @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the ellipses denote other operators ( see  @xcite ) . in the sm @xmath22",
    "is suppressed by a factor @xmath23 , hence @xmath24 is usually neglected .",
    "the remaining term is then simply denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "however , in generic extensions of the sm , there is no reason to expect a suppression of additional contributions to @xmath22 relative to @xmath26 .",
    "the coupling of the photon to the quark electric charge in @xmath14 implies that the diagrams of figure  [ fig1 ] contribute to the electroweak penguin amplitude in the general flavour decomposition of hadronic two - body decay amplitudes .",
    "adopting the @xmath27 notation of  @xcite extended to allow for the three helicity amplitudes of @xmath4 , the new contribution to the transverse electroweak penguin amplitudes is @xmath28 with @xmath29 taking into account the effect of quark loop diagrams ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath30 is a ratio of tensor to ( axial ) vector @xmath31 form factors such that @xmath32 equals 1 in the heavy quark limit  @xcite , while @xmath33 is of order @xmath34 .",
    "we note the large enhancement factor @xmath35 , which implies that the first hierarchy in ( [ hierarchy ] ) is inverted , rendering the negative - helicity amplitude @xmath6 leading over the longitudinal amplitude @xmath5 in the heavy - quark limit . of course ,",
    "for real values of @xmath36 this enhancement is compensated by the small electromagnetic coupling @xmath37 .",
    "for instance , for neutral @xmath38 mesons , we obtain @xmath39 .",
    "this should be compared to the uncorrected negative - helicity electroweak penguin amplitude @xmath40 and the leading qcd penguin amplitude @xmath41 the @xmath42 are wilson coefficients for the various penguin operators in the effective hamiltonian  @xcite , and the ellipses denote the 1-loop corrections in qcd factorization @xcite , which we have taken into account in the numerical estimates . in the sm",
    "the corresponding positive - helicity amplitudes are suppressed by about an order of magnitude relative to the negative - helicity ones as explained above .",
    "there are strong - interaction corrections to the leading - order expression ( [ dal3ew ] ) from gluon exchange between the quark lines in the second diagram of figure  [ fig1 ] , and also through hard interactions with the spectator quark ( not shown in the figure ) in the @xmath0 meson . due to factorization",
    "as discussed below , these corrections modify only the effective @xmath17 transition at leading order in the expansion in @xmath43 .",
    "they have been computed in next - to - leading order in the context of factorization of exclusive radiative @xmath0 decays  @xcite , and can be incorporated by substituting @xmath44 ( first paper of  @xcite , eq .",
    "turning this argument around , the absolute value of @xmath45 can be obtained from the branching fraction of @xmath46 via @xmath47 with @xmath48 a tensor form factor .",
    "this results in @xmath49 , close to the leading - order estimate from ( [ dal3ew ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the new radiative contribution to the negative - helicity electroweak penguin amplitude is at least twice as large ( and opposite in sign ) as was previously assumed . for penguin - dominated @xmath50 transitions",
    "it is almost half the size of the leading qcd penguin amplitude , and should therefore have visible impact on polarization measurements . in case of new interactions generating @xmath51 , the corresponding contribution to the positive - helicity amplitude ( [ dal3ew ] ) should be observed against a very small standard model background .",
    "since the existence of an amplitude violating the power counting  ( [ hierarchy ] ) may appear surprising , we sketch how this amplitude emerges and factorizes in soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite .",
    "the notation and method of the following discussion is similar to the one in  @xcite . after integrating out the scale @xmath16",
    ", scet formalizes the interaction of the static @xmath9-quark field @xmath52 with collinear fields for the light - like direction @xmath53 , in which meson @xmath54 moves , and collinear fields for the light - like direction @xmath55 of meson @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the collinear quark field corresponding to @xmath14 , and let @xmath14 be the meson that does not pick up the spectator quark from the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the leading quark bilinears that have non - vanishing overlap with @xmath57 are @xmath58 the subscript @xmath59 denotes projection of a lorentz vector on the plane transverse to the two light - cone vectors @xmath60 . both operators scale as @xmath61 according to the scet scaling rules ; the first overlaps only with the longitudinal polarization state of @xmath14 , the second only with a transverse vector meson .",
    "however , the second operator is not generated by the v - a interactions of the sm ( at least at the tree and 1-loop level ) .",
    "this implies the power suppression of @xmath62 relative to @xmath5 in ( [ hierarchy ] ) , since the leading contribution to transverse polarization now involves an operator with an additional derivative @xmath63 .",
    "this reasoning ignores electromagnetic effects . including qed in scet",
    ", there is a collinear photon field with unsuppressed interactions with collinear quarks ( of the same direction ) .",
    "only the transverse photon field is truly a degree of freedom of the theory , since the other two components are either gauge - artefacts , or can be eliminated by the field equations .",
    "hence there is an additional operator @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 is an electromagnetic wilson line formally required to make the operator gauge - invariant ) , which overlaps only with a transversely polarized vector meson . to first order in the electromagnetic coupling",
    "the matrix element can be computed exactly yielding @xmath66(0)|0\\rangle =   -\\frac{2i}{3 } \\,a_{v_2 } \\frac{e^2 f_{v_2}}{m_{v_2}}\\ , \\epsilon_\\perp^{\\ast\\mu } \\label{me2}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 a transverse polarization vector , @xmath68 the decay constant , and @xmath69 a constant that depends on the quark - flavour composition of @xmath14 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "( the convention for the covariant derivative corresponding to ( [ o7 ] ) is @xmath73 with @xmath74 the quark electric charge . )",
    "the crucial point is that the operator @xmath75 scales with @xmath76 , hence this contribution to @xmath62 is a factor @xmath34 larger than even the longitudinal amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we find the tree - level matching equation ( see also @xcite ) @xmath77(0 ) \\big[w_\\gamma^\\dagger   id_{\\gamma\\perp}^\\mu w_\\gamma\\big](0 ) , \\label{scetop}\\ ] ] valid as an equation for the @xmath78 matrix element . in scet",
    "only soft fields can couple to the two brackets representing collinear field products in the two different directions .",
    "but since the photon operator in the second bracket is a colour - singlet , the soft fields decouple , and the matrix element of the right - hand side of ( [ scetop ] ) falls apart into ( [ me2 ] ) and @xmath79 , which is proportional to the scet form factor @xmath80  @xcite at maximal recoil .",
    "( [ scetop ] ) has to be amended by radiative corrections as well as a second operator structure with an additional transverse derivative in the first bracket .",
    "this is very similar to heavy - to - light form factors  @xcite , in fact , these corrections simply restore the qcd tensor form factor . combining ( [ me2],[scetop ] ) , we therefore find @xmath81 which on accounting for the normalization of @xmath82 @xcite reproduces ( [ dal3ew ] ) .",
    "the previous equation should be understood such that the matrix element of @xmath83 ( @xmath24 ) takes the value given only when both @xmath54 and @xmath14 have negative ( positive ) helicity , but is zero otherwise . in general",
    ", the four - quark operators from the effective weak hamiltonian also contribute to the matching coefficient of the scet operator on the right - hand side of ( [ scetop ] ) , and including further spectator - scattering effects replaces @xmath84 by @xmath85 as discussed above .",
    "we now focus on the eight @xmath87 decay modes , where the electroweak penguin amplitude is largest relative to the leading qcd penguin amplitude ( @xmath70 ) . assuming isospin symmetry , the @xmath88 system is described by six complex strong interaction parameters for each helicity @xmath89 . neglecting the colour - suppressed electroweak penguin amplitude and the doubly ckm suppressed qcd penguin amplitude is a good approximation for elucidating the effect of the new ( colour - allowed ) electroweak penguin contribution ,",
    "hence we write @xmath90+e^{-i\\gamma } \\,[t_h+c_h ] \\nonumber\\\\ a_h(\\rho^+ k^{\\ast - } ) & = & p_h+e^{-i\\gamma } \\,t_h \\nonumber\\\\ -\\sqrt{2}\\,a_h(\\rho^0 \\bar k^{\\ast 0 } ) & = & [ p_h - p_h^{ew}]+e^{-i\\gamma}\\,[-c_h ] , \\label{first}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and define @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the qcd penguin amplitude .",
    "the tree amplitudes @xmath93 , @xmath94 are suppressed by the ckm factor latexmath:[$\\epsilon_{\\rm km } = |v_{ub } v_{us}^*|/    is known , one can obtain @xmath92 from an angular analysis of the @xmath96 final state , @xmath97 from @xmath98 , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 from the remaining four decay modes . in principle , this allows for a determination of @xmath101 , which can be compared to the theoretical result . in practice , a complete amplitude analysis will be experimentally difficult .",
    "the sensitivity to the electroweak penguin amplitude is made apparent in cp - averaged helicity - decay rate ratios such as @xmath102 where @xmath103 depends on @xmath100 ( and mildly on @xmath99 ) , and vanishes for @xmath104 .",
    "to estimate @xmath105 , we assume that the positive - helicity amplitudes are negligible as predicted in the sm , and use the observed @xmath106 branching fraction and longitudinal polarization fraction @xmath107 to determine the magnitude of @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we shall also assume that the phase of @xmath110 is not more than @xmath111 away from @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "writing @xmath114\\times t_h$ ] , this amounts to the assumption that no large cp asymmetries will be found in @xmath115 . for all other quantities",
    "we perform a calculation in the qcd factorization framework . in this procedure",
    "there is a considerable uncertainty in @xmath109 due to the discrepant experimental results on @xmath116 @xcite , which may result in an over - estimate of @xmath109 and hence an under - estimate of @xmath117 .",
    "it is therefore not excluded that the electromagnetic penguin effect is more pronounced than in the following theoretical estimates . keeping this in mind",
    ", we find @xmath118 $ ] and @xmath119 , yielding @xmath120 . \\label{s1}\\ ] ] here ( and below ) the numbers in brackets refer to the calculation without the new electromagnetic penguin contribution . despite the current large theoretical uncertainties , which could be removed with more experimental data , eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) clearly shows the impact of this contribution on polarization observables .",
    "the effect is even more significant for the ratio of the two final states with neutral @xmath38 mesons , as @xmath121 [ ( [ r2 ] ) below ] changes by a factor of about 4 whether or not the electromagnetic penguin contribution is included , but for this ratio the tree contamination is also larger .",
    "data is currently not available to test ( [ s1 ] ) , but we may instead consider @xmath122 following the same strategy as above , we obtain @xmath123 , and @xmath124 $ ] . in the absence of direct cp asymmetries @xmath125",
    "is directly related to the corresponding ratio of polarization fractions @xmath126 . including a theoretical estimate of the cp asymmetries , we obtain @xmath127 , \\\\ & & f_-^\\prime = \\frac{1-f_l(\\rho^0\\bar k^{\\ast - } ) } { 1-f_l(\\rho^-\\bar k^{\\ast 0 } ) } =   0.4 \\pm 0.1\\,\\,[{0.8}\\pm 0.1 ] .",
    "\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be compared to the experimental values @xmath128 , @xmath129  @xcite .",
    "finally we comment on the possibility of detecting the presence of new flavour - changing neutral currents in the form of an electromagnetic penguin operator with opposite chirality , @xmath130 .",
    "for this analysis , one must isolate experimentally the positive - helicity amplitudes . theoretically , all positive - helicity amplitudes are suppressed , except for the electromagnetic penguin contribution @xmath131 to the electroweak penguin amplitude . in the naive factorization approximation @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is a @xmath43-suppressed form factor ratio , while @xmath134 is suppressed only by the ratio of wilson coefficients ( see ( [ new2 ] ) )",
    ". a conservative analysis of the @xmath135 branching fraction constrains @xmath136 ,",
    "hence it is possible that the suppression is weak .",
    "this would lead to @xmath137 , in which case the positive - helicity decay rates of the @xmath138 final states are much larger than the @xmath139 ones .",
    "a complete angular analysis of the @xmath140 system should allow a determination of @xmath141 even when it is not dominant , possibly allowing a limit on @xmath142 of order @xmath143 .    in conclusion",
    ", we discussed an electromagnetic penguin contribution to non - leptonic @xmath0 decays that has previously been overlooked .",
    "it is the largest contribution to the negative - helicity electroweak penguin amplitude , and substantially modifies the theoretical expectations for polarization observables in @xmath50 penguin - dominated decays , in particular to the @xmath138 final states .",
    "these observables may therefore be of considerable interest to the search for electromagnetic flavour - changing neutral currents with chirality equal or opposite to the sm .",
