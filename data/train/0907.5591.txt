    "one of the most intriguing issues in cosmology concerns with the state of the universe in the earliest epoch of its evolution .",
    "it is this phase where answers to some of the most difficult questions in conventional cosmology are hidden which includes understanding the initial conditions of our universe .",
    "it is difficult to understand the latter via cosmological models based on classical general relativity ( gr ) since it break downs at very large spacetime curvatures and predicts an initial singularity .",
    "therefore , any viable description of the history of our universe must necessarily have inputs from a framework beyond gr .",
    "not surprisingly , one expects that any such model must capture quantum aspects of gravity in order to be successful .",
    "though a treatment based on a full theory of quantum gravity is beyond the scope at the present stage , nevertheless useful insights have been obtained on the nature of the universe at planck scale in various frameworks . in one of the earliest works in this direction",
    ", wheeler showed that the spacetime near the initial singularity resembles a quantum foam @xcite ( a picture shared with the analysis of quantization of conformal modes in gravity @xcite ) . in recent years",
    "a different picture seems to emerge in some models based on non - perturbative canonical quantum gravity . in loop quantum cosmology ( see ref.@xcite for an introductory review ) a quantization of symmetry reduced spacetimes based on background independent loop quantum gravity , backward evolution of states for different stress - energy contents , show existence of a bounce near the planck scale to a classical contracting branch @xcite .",
    "the quantum bounce is non - singular and allows a unitary evolution across the `` big bang '' _ without any violation of null energy condition ( nec)_. these results indicate that the universe may have a `` pre big bang '' branch which plays an important role in the history and the fate of the universe .",
    "interestingly , though loop quantum cosmology predicts existence of a contracting universe preceding ours , the idea of a pre big bang branch of the universe is not new .",
    "various paradigms in theoretical cosmology have conjectured an existence of such a pre big bang branch and existence of a non - singular bounce is the most crucial element for them to be viable .",
    "as an example , pre big bang branch is envisioned in ekpyrotic / cyclic model paradigm @xcite which is also considered as an alternative to the inflationary scenarios ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is based on the inputs from m - theory where it is envisioned that the universe undergoes cycles of expansion and contraction governed by the inter - brane dynamics of two boundary branes in a five dimensional bulk . our observable universe is hypothesized to be confined on one of the boundary branes which interacts only gravitationally with the other brane .",
    "attraction between the branes leads to their collision , an event which corresponds to a big bang or big crunch singularity for the observable universe .",
    "the transition from the contracting to the expanding branch when the branes collide and separate is a tricky issue in the ekpyrotic / cyclic models . though insights on this problem from the bulk spacetime perspective have been gained ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , its solution remains elusive in the 4-dimensional cosmological picture . in its absence a viable non - singular cosmological model of the early universe",
    "is difficult to construct .",
    "insights on obtaining a non - singular transition in the ekpyrotic / cyclic model is expected from understanding the role of non - perturbative quantum gravitational effects which are well understood in loop quantum gravity . in particular",
    "a lot of progress has been made in recent years on understanding resolution of singularities in the framework of loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "this leads to a natural question ( which is the focus of this work ) : is it possible to obtain a non - singular transition in the ekpyrotic / cyclic model using inputs from loop quantum cosmology ?",
    "loop quantum cosmology is a canonical non - perturbative quantization of homogeneous spacetimes based on dirac s method of constraint quantization .",
    "the gravitational part of the classical phase space is labeled by the ashtekar variables : su(2 ) connection @xmath0 ( which in a cosmological setting is proportional to rate of change of scale factor at the classical level ) and conjugate triad @xmath1 ( proportional to the square of the scale factor ) . the elementary variables used for quantization in loop quantum cosmology are the holonomies of the connection components and triads .",
    "quantization proceeds with expressing the classical hamiltonian constraint , consisting of the field strength tensor of the ashtekar connection , in terms of elementary variables .",
    "the resulting quantum constraint captures the underlying discreteness in quantum geometry ( one of the predictions of loop quantum gravity ) and turns out to be uniformly discrete in volume .",
    "this has been shown to be a property of isotropic models ( for all values of curvature index @xmath2 ) @xcite and bianchi - i spacetimes @xcite where one has rigorous analytical control and extensive numerical simulations have been performed .    some of the novel features of loop quantization can be described as follows .",
    "let us consider a isotropic universe filled with a massless scalar field .",
    "take a state which is peaked at the classical trajectory at late times and evolve it with the loop quantum constraint towards the big bang .",
    "it turns out that the state remains peaked at the classical trajectory till spacetime curvature @xmath3 is approximately @xmath4 of the planck value , however on further evolution there are significant departures from the classical theory . instead of following the classical trajectory till the big bang as in the wheeler - dewitt theory",
    ", evolution leads to a bounce of the universe when energy density of the universe reaches a critical value , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "after the bounce the state then evolves further to peak on the classical trajectory for a contracting universe .",
    "these turn out to be robust features of the theory . using an exactly solvable model",
    "it can be proved that the bounce is a property _ for all the states _ in the physical hilbert space and there exists a supremum for the energy density operator given by the above value @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations are bounded across the bounce and the state which is semi - classical at late times post bounce is also semi - classical at early times pre bounce @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that existence of bounce does not require any fine tuning of initial conditions or a special choice of matter .",
    "in fact for the above case , matter satisfies stiff equation of state throughout the evolution .",
    "existence of bounce and non - singular evolution has also been shown for scalar field with cosmological constant ( for positive @xcite as well as negative values @xcite ) and the inflationary potential @xcite .",
    "another important feature of loop quantum cosmology is that it turns out that there exists a unique consistent loop quantization for the isotropic spacetimes as well as the bianchi - i spacetime @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to write an effective hamiltonian in loop quantum cosmology with a resulting dynamics which approximates the underlying quantum dynamics to an excellent accuracy .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can be derived using coherent state techniques for different matter sources @xcite . assuming that effective dynamics is valid for arbitrary matter ( an assumption which turns out to be true for various cases )",
    ", it is possible to prove that isotropic flat loop quantum cosmology is generically non - singular and geodesically complete @xcite .",
    "it resolves all known types of cosmological singularities .",
    "similar results are expected for curved and anisotropic models .",
    "results obtained in the full quantum theory , numerical simulations and the effective theory strongly indicate that resolution of cosmological singularities is natural in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "the availability of an effective description leads us to explore a viable non - singular bouncing model in the effective description of loop quantum cosmology with the ekpyrotic / cyclic model potential .",
    "this serves as a first step to investigate the role of non - perturbative quantum gravity effects as derived in loop quantum gravity to the ekpyrotic / cyclic models . for the case",
    "when anisotropies are absent , such an analysis was performed earlier @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a non - singular bounce is generically possible for the flat isotropic ekpyrotic / cyclic model in loop quantum cosmology . despite this",
    "a viable model was not possible due to lack of a turn around of the moduli field in the epoch when the branes collide and separate , inhibiting a cyclic phenomena .",
    "it was shown that unless the ekpyrotic / cyclic model potential becomes positive when the singularity is approached it is not possible for the moduli field to turn around in the process of transition from contracting to the expanding branch ( or vice versa ) and lead to cycles .",
    "however in a realistic universe anisotropies are always present , even if their strength be very small .",
    "hence it is important to analyze whether the limitations pointed out in the analysis of ref.@xcite were artifacts of the assumption of pure isotropy .",
    "it is pertinent to ask whether there exists a viable non - singular ekpyrotic / cyclic model for effective loop quantum dynamics incorporating anisotropic properties of spacetime ?",
    "as we will show the answer turns out to be positive .",
    "we will see that the mere presence of shear term in the cosmological dynamics leads to a turn around of the moduli field from the negative region of the potential . instead of a single bounce of the scale factor , the anisotropic effective dynamics obtained from the loop quantization of bianchi - i model exhibits bounces for each of the directional scale factors .",
    "numerical simulations show that the turn around of the moduli occurs in the middle of the transition of the mean scale factor from the contracting to the expanding branch .",
    "further , the anisotropic shear remains bounded throughout the evolution .",
    "thus a non - singular transition from the contracting to the expanding phase with a turn around of the moduli as envisioned in the ekpyrotic / cyclic model paradigm is achieved in the effective loop quantum dynamics .",
    "this is the main result of our analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we re -",
    "visit the classical theory of bianchi - i model in the ashtekar variables .",
    "we describe the way classical generalized friedman equation for an anisotropic model can be derived in a hamiltonian treatment .",
    "iii we consider the effective hamiltonian of the bianchi - i model for the loop quantization performed in ref .",
    "this quantization for bianchi - i model has recently been shown to be the only consistent choice which leads to a bounded shear and expansion factors @xcite .",
    "using hamilton s equations we derive the dynamical equations for connections and triad components ( the dynamical equations for matter such as the klein - gordon equation are not changed by quantum gravitational effects ) and highlight some of the properties of the effective theory .",
    "in sec iv , we use the effective dynamics to analyze the potential in the ekpyrotic / cyclic model . using numerical techniques we study the evolution of the moduli field focusing in particular on the transition from the contracting branch to the expanding branch .",
    "we show that a non - singular turn around of the scale factor along with the same for the moduli field is possible in the effective 4-dimensional description without any extra inputs . we summarize the results and discuss open issues in the concluding section .",
    "the bianchi - i spacetime is one of the simplest examples of spacetimes with anisotropies .",
    "it has vanishing intrinsic curvature and unlike bianchi - ix model , the classical dynamics does not exhibit bkl behavior as the singularity is approached .",
    "the isotropic limit of this spacetime is @xmath6 frw cosmological spacetime .",
    "we consider a homogeneous bianchi - i anisotropic spacetime with a manifold @xmath7 where @xmath8 is topologically flat @xmath9 .",
    "the spatial manifold is non - compact and in order to define the symplectic structure and formulate a hamiltonian theory , it is necessary to introduce a fiducial cell @xmath10 .",
    "the cell @xmath10 has fiducial volume @xmath11 with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath12 endowed on the spatial manifold . here",
    "@xmath13 refer to the coordinate lengths of the each side of the fiducial cell . and one could choose these to be unity .",
    "we do not restrict to this choice in order to stress the independence of physics in the classical and especially the effective theory on the fiducial cell .",
    "the latter feature is not shared by alternative quantizations of bianchi - i model in loop quantum cosmology . ]",
    "due to the homogeneity of the bianchi - i spacetime , the ashtekar variables take a simple form . the matrix valued connection @xmath0 and triad @xmath1",
    "can be expressed as @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively ( where @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "the canonical conjugate phase space variables satisfy \\{c_i , p_j } = 8 g _ ij   where @xmath17 is the barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "the triad @xmath18 are related to the three scale factors @xmath19 of the bianchi - i metric d s^2 = -n^2 d t^2 + a_1 ^ 2 d x^2 + a_2 ^ 2 d y^2 + a_3 ^ 2 d z^2 as [ triadsf ] |p_1| = l_2 l_3 a_2 a_3 ,   |p_2| = l_1 l_3 a_1 a_3 ,   |p_3| = l_2 l_3 a_2 a_3   where the modulus sign arises because of orientation of the triads ( and is suppressed in the following ) .",
    "the only non - trivial constraint to be solved in this model is the hamiltonian constraint which when expressed in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 takes the form : [ clh ] h _",

    "if we choose the lapse function @xmath22 , then using ( [ clh ] ) and ( [ cdot ] ) we obtain [ ceq ] c_i = l_i a_i = l_i h_i a_i   where @xmath23 is the hubble rate in the i - th direction .",
    "similarly we can obtain the dynamical equations for the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "as an example , in case @xmath20 corresponds to a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath24 with momentum @xmath25 ( satisfying @xmath26 ) and potential @xmath27 , the dynamical equations take the standard form [ mateq1 ] = p _ h _",

    "( iii ) it is also possible for the effective dynamics to saturate eq.([rhomax ] ) at the bounce .",
    "however , in that case anisotropy vanishes at the bounce .",
    "these features exhibit richness of the effective dynamics in the bianchi - i model .",
    "they result due to incorporation of quantum geometry effects in the effective bianchi - i spacetime .",
    "when the components of the spacetime curvature become large , there are significant departures from the classical theory .",
    "when these components are small compared to the planck scale then dynamical equations approximate their classical counterparts and one recovers the classical description .",
    "it is important to note that the upper bounds on energy density , shear and hubble rate are direct consequences of the underlying quantum geometry . in the classical limit @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "diverge and the evolution is singular .",
    "the boundedness of these quantities plays the crucial role to construct non - singular ekpyrotic / cyclic model as we we discuss in the following section .",
    "in the previous section we analyzed the effective dynamics of bianchi - i model in loop quantum cosmology for matter with vanishing anisotropic stress . an important feature of quantum geometry modified dynamics turns out to be singularity resolution .",
    "we showed that the energy density , hubble rates and shear are always bounded in loop quantum cosmology independent of the equation of state of the matter content .",
    "this result is very encouraging for the primary question posed in this work : is there a viable non - singular evolution with the ekpryotic / cyclic potential in the effective loop quantum cosmology ?",
    "we now explore the answer to this question .",
    "let us first briefly recall some of the salient features of ekpyrotic / cyclic model which is motivated by m - theory .",
    "it is hypothesized that the observable universe is constrained on a visible brane which interacts gravitationally with a shadow brane .",
    "the collision between these branes constitutes the big bang / big crunch singularities for the observable universe in the 4-dimensional effective description .",
    "the inter - brane separation is determined by a moduli field @xmath78 and the interaction potential is given by @xcite [ cyclicpot ] v = v_o ( 1 - e^-_1 ) ( -e^-_2 )   where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the parameters of the potential .",
    "an attractive feature of the ekpryotic / cyclic models is the different roles which the moduli plays in various epochs . when the branes approach each other , the moduli field moves slowly in an almost flat and positive part of the potential which in the effective 4-dimensional description leads to a period of dark energy domination .",
    "eventually when the potential energy of the moduli balances the hubble expansion rate , the moduli field turns around and the inter - brane separation starts decreasing leading to a contracting phase in the universe .",
    "when the branes approach each other , the moduli potential is steep and negative leading to an ultra - stiff equation of state , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "it turns out that this feature leads to a decrease in the anisotropy of the universe at small scale factors @xcite .",
    "the ultra - stiff equation of state is also responsible for producing a scale invariant spectrum of fluctuations with a significant non - gaussian contribution @xcite .",
    "the latter serves as a distinct prediction to the inflationary scenarios , and is available for test in the near future .",
    "the branes collide at @xmath82 which follows their separation and running of moduli field towards the positive value of potential , leading to a cyclic phenomena .",
    "thus , the 4-dimensional effective dynamics description of the ekpyrotic / cyclic model is very rich and interesting .",
    "a primary issue in the ekpyrotic / cyclic model is to understand the transition from the contracting to the expanding branch .",
    "this transition must be non - singular and is vital to propagate the perturbations generated prior to the collision of the branes to the regime following the collision .",
    "in the 5 dimensional picture , the bulk spacetime near the collision of the branes appears as a compactified milne space and it has been argued that the resulting singularity is milder than the conventional big bang / crunch singularity @xcite .",
    "further , in this picture it may be possible to match the perturbations across the transition @xcite .",
    "this however results in the mixing of the modes with a strong sensitivity of predictions to the process of transition which ignores quantum gravitational effects .",
    "other ideas to understand this transition have been proposed including perturbative string theoretic treatment @xcite and ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "though promising directions to explore , these reveal little about the transition from the contracting to the expanding branch in the 4-dimensional effective theory . if one assumes that the 4-dimensional effective theory has no inputs from a theory beyond gr , this difficulty is not surprising .",
    "the reason is that in gr such a non - singular turn around is forbidden unless matter violates null energy condition . though it is not possible to have this violation in the ekpyrotic / cyclic models , a variant of these has been proposed in form of new ekpyrotic model @xcite which includes a ghost condensate .",
    "the latter is responsible for violation of null energy condition and can result in a bounce .",
    "whether such a non - singular bounce is a generic feature of this model and is not affected by the instabilities is not an open issue .",
    "further , it is not clear whether the 4-dimensional effective picture with a ghost condensate as conjectured in this model is valid at high energies of interest @xcite .    given that non - perturbative quantum geometric modifications and their role in singularity resolution is well understood in the homogeneous models of loop quantum cosmology , we now explore the effective 4-dimensional loop quantum dynamics of the moduli field to understand the transition from the contracting to the expanding branch .",
    "an underlying assumption of such an analysis is the treatment of potential ( [ cyclicpot ] ) as an effective one for the field @xmath24 in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "this enables us to use effective equations derived in the previous section with @xmath24 as the source of matter .",
    "an investigation on these lines was carried out earlier with an additional assumption that the spacetime be isotropic @xcite .",
    "its main conclusions were : + ( i ) the big bang / big crunch singularity is generically avoided irrespective of the choice of the parameters of the potential and initial conditions for the field @xmath24 .",
    "+ ( ii ) however , it is not possible in the isotropic effective loop quantum description for the field @xmath24 to turn around from @xmath83 .",
    "thus a cyclic evolution as envisioned in the ekpyrotic / cyclic model paradigm was not possible in the isotropic loop quantum cosmology .",
    ", then the turn around of the field and a cyclic description is possible @xcite . a modification to the cyclic potential",
    "as proposed in the bicyclic scenario @xcite would hence result in a desired non - singular evolution . ]    it should be noted that the absence of the turn - around of @xmath24 from large negative values is not a limitation of the loop quantum dynamics , but is a feature shared also by the classical theory .",
    "this can be easily seen from the classical friedman equation for the isotropic model . for simplicity",
    "let us assume that the only contribution to the matter energy density originates from the moduli field [ classical_fried ] h^2 = 8 g3 _ where [ rho_moduli ] _",
    "= 12 ^2 + v ( )  . for the moduli field to turn around it is essential that @xmath84 must vanish .",
    "using ( [ rho_moduli ] ) in ( [ classical_fried ] ) we get [ dotphimod ] ^2 = 2 ( 38 g h^2 - v ( ) )  .",
    "it is clear that a turn around of the field is not possible when the potential is negative . since in the ekpyrotic / cyclic model",
    "the potential is negative ( and asymptotes to zero ) when the branes are supposed to collide , @xmath84 can not vanish and the moduli can not turn around .",
    "presence of additional energy density components such as radiation is unlikely to affect this conclusion .",
    "the reason being that in the vicinity of brane collision @xmath85 , the dominant contribution to the energy density comes from the kinetic energy of the moduli .",
    "+ interestingly , above situation changes if the spacetime has a non - vanishing anisotropic shear . in this case , the classical generalized friedman equation yields ^2 = 2 ( 38 g ( h^2 - ^2a^6 ) - v ( ) )  .",
    "the shear term can be seen as an additional component of energy density which scales the same way as @xmath86 . thus depending on the strength of the shear term , it is possible that @xmath24 can turn around even when @xmath87 . however , the classical theory is singular and the above equation breaks down when spacetime curvature becomes very large .",
    "hence , though we get some insights on the possible role of anisotropic to alleviate the above problem , it is not possible to obtain a non - singular cyclic evolution without any additional inputs from quantum gravity or going beyond the scope of the classical theory .    given the non - trivial role the shear term can play in the dynamics of the moduli field in this model , it becomes important to analyze the effective loop quantum equations with anisotropies .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the only contribution to the matter density originates from the field @xmath24 . by specifying the @xmath20 corresponding to the cyclic potential @xcite we can derive the dynamics from hamilton s equations for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the moduli @xmath24 and its momentum @xmath25 as obtained in sec .",

    "the spikes reflect bounces and recollapses of individual scale factors in the planck regime during the transition from the contracting to the expanding branch.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we performed various numerical simulations with different initial data for the moduli field , expansion rates and anisotropy .",

    "this in a sharp contrast to the classical theory where such a transition is forbidden and the contracting and expanding branches are disjoint in the 4-dimensional description .",
    "interestingly as depicted in the fig .",
    "2 we also obtain a turn around of the moduli field .",
    "the moduli starts from the positive part of the potential when the universe is contracting , rolls down the negative region of potential and when the spacetime curvature reaches planck value , it turns around and goes back to the positive part .",
    "in the subsequent evolution the classical friction term stops the moduli field and it turns around causing a contraction of the universe .",
    "thus leading to a cyclic phenomena . in the above numerical simulation",

    "3 shows the evolution of the shear term obtained by the numerical integration .",
    "we find that the shear term varies significantly from its classical value in the region where the transition occurs .",
    "however , it is everywhere bounded and does not affect the occurrence of bounces . as discussed earlier , due to the property of evolution of shear in loop quantum cosmology , the value of shear scalar in the low curvature regime before and after the transition turns out to be the same .",
    "also for this numerical run , the shear scalar is very small when the moduli field turns around .",
    "we also find that the behavior of @xmath72 consists of spikes in the planck regime where the mean scale factor of the universe undergoes multiple bounces .",
    "using the expression of shear factor ( obtained from ( [ sigmascalar ] ) and ( [ sigma1 ] ) for loop quantum evolution ) , the cause of these spikes turns out to be due to rapid variation in the hubble rates in different directions occurring during multiple bounces .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 where in different curves we have shown the behavior of directional hubble rates .",
    "as can be seen the spikes in shear scalar coincide with the spikes in the directional hubble rates which occur due to multiple bounces and recollapse of anisotropic scale factors in the planck regime . +    , @xmath111 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "the shear term is bounded across the evolution with spikes corresponding to multiple bounces and recollapses of the individual scale factors.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]        another example of results obtained from numerical integration are shown in figs .",
    "the parameters of the potential ( [ cyclicpot ] ) were chosen as @xmath115 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the initial conditions specified at time @xmath116 were @xmath117 , @xmath111 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "these initial conditions correspond to two of the anisotropic directions contracting @xmath118 and one expanding ( @xmath119 ) . to understand the non - trivial role played by anisotropic term we also performed analysis of evolution in the isotropic loop quantum model for the same initial conditions for moduli field and the isotropized initial conditions for triad and connection . in fig",
    "5 we have shown the evolution of the scale factor in the present model ( solid curve ) and the isotropic model ( dashed curve ) . we find that the bounce of the scale factor is present both in presence and absence of anisotropy .",
    "the loop quantum evolution with the cyclic potential is thus non - singular with or without anisotropy .",
    "6 shows the evolution of the moduli field and we find that as for the previous case ( fig .",

    "we see that the shear term undergoes a significant variation in the region of non - singular transition but remains bounded .",
    "the spikes in the variation correspond to the spikes in the directional hubble rates which occur due to multiple bounces and recollapses of the scale factors @xmath128 .",
    "further , its value before and after the transition is preserved . unlike the previous case in fig .",
    "2 , the shear scalar is not small at the turn around of the moduli field but shows a spike . the behavior of energy density is shown in fig . 7 which demonstrates that at the bounces of the directional scale factors ( associated with the occurrence of spikes ) the energy density does not saturate to its maximum value , a feature due to the non - vanishing anisotropy at bounces .",
    "in contrast , the energy density at the bounce in the isotropic model always reaches its maximum value , @xmath129 at the bounce .",
    "+ in both of the previous simulations , though the initial anisotropic shear is small it is nevertheless of the same order .",
    "an interesting question which arises is whether the non - singular transition of the scale factor and the turn around of the moduli field occurs if the shear is decreased .",
    "it is to be noted that as shown in ref.@xcite the loop quantization of bianchi - i model leads to an upper bound on the expansion rate and anisotropic shear .",
    "these bounds are generic and independent of initial conditions for the matter content .",
    "the upper bound on the expansion rate implies that the mean scale factor would always bounce for the cyclic model potential as the classical singularity is approached .",
    "further , from the discussion of the classical theory we recall that the turn around of moduli field would require appropriate choice of initial conditions of the scalar field and anisotropy . in various simulations which we performed , we found that there exists a large range of initial data for which the turn around of moduli field can occur even for very small anisotropies .",
    "results from one such example are depicted in figs .",
    "we chose the same values of parameters as in previous simulations .",
    "the initial values are @xmath130 and @xmath121 .",
    "as can be seen from these plots a significant decrease in the initial anisotropy does not affect the bounce of the scale factor or the turn around of the moduli field .",
    "it is interesting to note that in these simulations the behavior of the mean scale factor and the scalar field seems symmetric across the middle of the transition from the contracting to the expanding branch . to understand this we first note that the weak symmetry of the variation of the scalar field in the transition regime stems from lack of interaction with any other form of matter .",
    "we expect that presence of additional matter degrees of freedom would lead to a pronounced asymmetry",
    ". further note that in the plots we depict the mean scale factor which actually suppresses the asymmetry of the individual scale factors across the bounce .",
    "this becomes clear if we plot the anisotropic scale factors as shown in fig .",
    "11 for the numerical simulation for fig . 10 . in fig .",
    "12 we show results from another numerical simulation where the asymmetry in the mean scale factor is not suppressed .",
    "the parameters are chosen as same in previous cases and the initial conditions are @xmath131 and @xmath126 .",
    "as we can see the behavior of scale factor and the scalar field across the bounce is not symmetric .",
    "+ we summarize the main results of the numerical analysis as follows : +    1 .",
    "irrespective of the choice of initial conditions , the classical singularity at @xmath132 is generically avoided in effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology for the cyclic model potential .",
    "starting from arbitrary anisotropic conditions , scale factors in different directions bounce when spacetime curvature becomes close to the planck value .",
    "this causes a bounce of the mean scale factor in the planck regime .",
    "the shear term remains bounded during the evolution and it approaches the constant classical value when spacetime curvature becomes small .",
    "interestingly , it is not difficult to choose the initial conditions such that avoidance of the singularity is accompanied by a turn around of the moduli field in the negative regime of the potential .",
    "the moduli then rushes towards the positive part of the potential , stops at certain positive value of the potential and roll back towards the negative value of the potential .",
    "this leads to a cyclic model of the universe .",
    "ekpyrotic / cyclic model is a very interesting paradigm for the early universe which is considered as an alternative to the inflationary scenarios . a key issue in this model is to understand the transition from contracting to the expanding branch in the 4-dimensional spacetime picture . in the 5-dimensional picture",
    "this transition corresponds to the collision between boundary branes in the bulk .",
    "though novel insights have been gained in the latter phenomenon @xcite , obtaining a non - singular transition in the 4-dimensional picture has remained an open issue .",
    "understanding which is important for various reasons including the way cosmological perturbations propagate from the contracting to the expanding branch . given the penrose - hawking singularity theorems ,",
    "a non - singular transition is not possible in the framework of classical theory .",
    "there are hopes to alleviate this problem in the classical framework by introduction of a ghost condensate , however the approach has its own limitations @xcite .    our analysis is based on the widely accepted notion that resolution of singularities involves going beyond the classical description of gravity . in particular , inputs from non - perturbative quantization of gravity may be necessary to avoid singularities . in our approach",
    "we have used the effective spacetime description of loop quantum cosmology to analyze the dynamics of the ekpyrotic / cyclic model .",
    "it is a non - perturbative quantization of homogeneous spacetimes based on loop quantum gravity and has successfully addressed resolution of cosmological singularities in various settings @xcite with a general picture of replacement of big bang with big bounce at the planck scale . in this work",
    "we have focussed on the resolution of big bang / crunch singularity in the ekpyrotic / cyclic model .",
    "such an investigation has been performed earlier @xcite using the assumption that the spacetime be purely isotropic .",
    "it was found that though the 4-dimensional scale factor generically bounces in the planck regime a viable cyclic model is not possible due to lack of a turn around of the moduli field from the negative region of the cyclic model potential .    to probe whether conclusions reached in the previous work @xcite were artifacts of ignoring anisotropic shear , we include them in the analysis and investigate the dynamics with the effective description of loop quantization of the bianchi - i spacetime .",
    "our analysis assumes vanishing intrinsic curvature ( whose consequences are discussed below ) and the moduli field as the only source of the matter energy density .",
    "the effective dynamical equations are complicated to solve analytically due to which various numerical simulations were performed with different choices of the parameter of the cyclic model potential and initial conditions .",
    "we find that the universe undergoes a non - singular transition from the contracting to the expanding branch accompanied by small multiple bounces for individual scale factors in the planck regime .",
    "in contrast to the previous results , we find that it is possible to easily choose initial conditions such that the moduli field turns around from the negative part of the potential in the planck regime .",
    "thus leading to a potentially viable non - singular ekpyrotic / cyclic model without introduction of any exotic matter .",
    "this is the novel result of our analysis .",
    "it should be noted that the anisotropies play a very non - trivial role to obtain a non - singular cyclic model in our analysis . at first sight",
    "it seems perplexing because in the ekpryosis phase , which occurs when the moduli field is in the steep negative region of the potential , anisotropies become small and the universe evolves towards an isotropic phase .",
    "however as we demonstrated , even though anisotropies may become very small during the evolution , their non - zero value is important to turn around the moduli field in the negative part of the potential .",
    "recall that such a turn around is not possible even for the classical theory in the absence of anisotropies .",
    "hence the loop quantum evolution successfully leads to a turn around of the scale factor and the moduli without affecting nice features of the ekpyrotic / cyclic model .",
    "there remain several open questions which require further investigations .",
    "one of them deals with generalizing our model to include the intrinsic curvature of the spacetime which will require studying loop quantization of spacetimes such as bianchi - ix .",
    "it will also help in obtaining insights on the bkl behavior in loop quantum cosmology and whether it affects the conclusion reached in this work .",
    "a second issue is to gain more analytical control on the effective dynamics of the anisotropic loop quantum cosmology . due to its complexity",
    "it is difficult to obtain an analog of generalized friedman equations with shear term in loop quantum cosmology , however various insights have been obtained on general features of the effective dynamics .",
    "these include , showing that expansion parameter and shear term are universally bounded @xcite .",
    "further analytical studies in this direction on the ekpyrotic / cyclic model will be reported elsewhere .",
    "it will be also useful to understand the full loop quantum dynamics with the cyclic potential and compare with the effective dynamics treatment as done presently .",
    "also in order to have a more realistic ekpyrotic / cyclic model , it is important to include radiation , study its interaction with moduli field and its influence on the non - singular transition obtained in this work .",
    "finally , it is an open problem to introduce inhomogeneities in our framework and understand the role of quantum gravitational effects on their propagation through the bounce .",
    "recent results on study of fock quantized inhomogeneous modes on the loop quantum spacetime are encouraging in this respect @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that incorporation of these inhomogeneities may reveal subtle imprints of quantum gravity on the predictions of the ekpyrotic / cyclic model .",
    "we are indebted to paul steinhardt for insightful discussions and helpful comments .",
