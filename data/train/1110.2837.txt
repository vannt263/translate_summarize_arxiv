    "we simulate cassiopea ( upside - down ) jellyfish in channel flow using a classical immersed boundary method as developed by charles peskin and using datatank ( visual datatools , inc . ) for post processing of images .",
    "we performed laboratory dye visualization using a flow tank constructed by dr .",

    "lot number : 118372 . )",
    "a full pulse of the simulated jellyfish consists of a cycle of a contraction ( 0.6 s ) , a short pause ( 0.13 s ) , a relaxation ( 0.7 s ) and a longer pause ( 2.0 s. ) oscillating and periodic one - directional flows have a frequency of 0.21 hz .",
    "channel flow speeds were simulated at 0.0 cm / s , 1.0 cm / s and 2.0 cm / s as indicated in the videos .",
    "+ each numerical simulation shows a vorticity plot for the fluid around the bell of the model jellyfish .",
    "the simulations show the speed and direction of the current influence the formation and shedding of vortices around the tips of the bell .",
    "the simulations also indicate the prominent oral arms structures play a role in vorticity trapping and shedding .",
    "dye visualization experiments qualitatively reveal similar results ."
