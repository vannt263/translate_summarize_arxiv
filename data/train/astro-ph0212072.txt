    "the flux calibrator was also used as a bandpass calibrator and was observed once for 17 minutes at the beginning of the observing period .",
    "the phase calibrator was observed in 3 minute scans alternating with 25 minute scans on ngc  2613 .",
    "the total on - source observing time was 2.4 hours and on - line hanning velocity smoothing was applied .",

    "the resulting ( ra , dec , velocity ) cube was then examined for broad scale structure .",
    "the calibrated d array uv data were then combined with the previously obtained c array uv data ( on - source observing time = 15.3 hours , see paper i ) to improve the signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio .",

    "this tail is likely produced via an interaction with the companion , eso  495-g017 , to the north - west , whose systemic velocity is separated from that of ngc  2613 by only 143 km s@xmath7 .",

    "[ moments]a and [ pv ] for a more thorough discussion of these features , presented below .",
    "f1 appears similar to what has previously been seen ( fig .",
    "[ carray ] ) , but at lower resolution .",
    "the pv plot for f1 can be seen in slice 2 which reveals it as a distinct feature at a velocity of 250 km s@xmath7 but it can also be seen in slice 1 as well , extending to a projected _ z _ height of at least 100@xmath9 ( 12.6 kpc ) `` above '' ( i.e. positive _ z _ ) mid - plane . a newly seen extension immediately to the west of f1 , sampled by slice 3 , may actually be associated with or part of f1 , since it is seen in pv space as a small arc at about the same velocity as f1 .",
    "f2 ( see slice 1 ) shows several velocity components and is more complex than previously seen . like f1",

    "[ carray ] and is sampled by slice 4 which reveals it as a 2-pronged arc above the disk centered at a velocity of 100 km s@xmath7 .",
    "such double peaks in velocity space are typical of such features and have been seen in other galaxies ( see , e.g. lee & irwin 1997 , lee et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the extension to the left of the f4 label in fig .  [ moments]a ) extends to a height 225@xmath9 ( 28 kpc ) below ( i.e. negative _ z _ ) mid - plane in this map .",
    "as can be seen in slice 3 of the pv map , this feature occurs at a velocity of 50 km s@xmath7 and shows no velocity gradient with height .",
    "f4 reaches the highest _ z _ of all the extensions and , to our knowledge , reaches higher latitudes than any previously seen in an edge - on galaxy , exceeding even the starburst galaxy , ngc  5775 , whose known hi features extend to @xmath4 7 kpc from the plane ( lee et al .",
    "this is remarkable , given that ngc  2613 ( log l@xmath10 = 10.00 ) has a massive ( 0.1 @xmath11 100 m@xmath3 ) star formation rate that is a factor of 3 lower than that of ngc  5775 and a supernova input energy rate per unit area that is a factor of 7 less than ngc  5775 ( irwin et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "feature f5 is sampled by slices 8 and 9 and can most clearly be seen in slice 9 as a vertical feature above the plane in pv space at a velocity of -300 km s@xmath7 . whereas it appeared as a single extension in fig .",
    "[ carray ] , it can now be seen to have a counterpart 55@xmath9 ( 7 kpc ) in projection farther out along the disk which is sampled by slice 10 .",
    "the counterpart clearly occurs at the same velocity and also shows no velocity gradient with height .",
    "these two features may form the base of a large loop or cylinder , similar to what has been seen in galaxies like ngc  5775 ( lee et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the most interesting and well - defined feature , however , is associated with f6 .",
    "for example , slices 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 pass through a feature below the major axis which extends 22 kpc ( 175@xmath9 ) in projection , from the plane and centers at -307 km",
    "individual channel maps of this feature are shown in fig .",
    "[ channels ]",
    ". we will refer to this as the -307 km s@xmath7 feature , rather than f6 since , as revealed by the new data , the feature is more extensive than what was originally seen in fig .",
    "[ carray ] . this feature will be discussed extensively in sect .",
    "[ 307feature ] .",
    "this disk - halo emission is faint ( 3 - 4 @xmath12 typically , note contour spacings in fig .",
    "[ pv ] ) but we consider the above - discussed features to be real because , _",
    "1 ) _ their spatial morphology is typical of the kinds of extensions and loops seen in other edge - on systems , _ 2 ) _ even though the feature might be faint far from the disk , there is evidence for disturbed contours ` beneath them ' even at highly significant contour levels ( see the 5th and 6th contours of fig .",
    "[ moments]a , for example ) , _ 3 ) _ at least the 6 major features , f1 to f6 can be seen in both independent data sets , _ 4 ) _ the features generally occur over several independent beams and/or velocity channels , and _ 5 ) _ in pv space , the features are distinct , yet smooth and connect continuously to the disk , unlike artifacts produced by a badly cleaned beam ( see , e.g. the arc above the disk seen in slice 3 of fig .  [ pv ] at @xmath4 270 km s@xmath7 or the larger structures in slices 9 and 10 ) . in addition , _ 6 ) _ the receding and advancing panels of panels of fig .  [ pv ] ) show _ averages _ over the entire advancing and receding sides of the disk , rather than just selected individual slices as shown elsewhere in the figure . in these panels , therefore , we have basically averaged together signal with noise and weak extensions would be diluted ( i.e. `` beam - averaged '' , where the beam is the size of half the galaxy ) . yet these panels still show the extensions quite clearly , especially on the advancing side where the disk - halo emission is dominated almost entirely by the -307 km s@xmath7 feature .",
    "this feature is seen up to the 4th contour which is a 6@xmath12 detection in the diluted averaged panel .",
    "finally , _ 7 ) _ for at least 4 of the 6 features , there is evidence from independent observations that extraplanar emission is present . for example , our radio continuum image ( see fig .",
    "9 of paper i ) shows extended emission at the positions of f3 , f4 , f5 , and f6 .",
    "also , an early hi image by bottema ( 1989 ) at lower resolution shows extended hi emission at roughly the same locations .    the zeroth moment map of fig .",
    "[ moments]a also shows a number of low intensity  disconnected \" features at high latitudes ( for example , the emission around -300@xmath9 , -200@xmath9 ) .",
    "we do _ not _ claim that all of these are real , but we have chosen to display them for the sake of comparison with future observations and because some of the emission shown in independent lower resolution images ( e.g. bottema 1989 , irwin et al .",
    "1999 ) is so extended .",
    "an example would be the ` knot ' of emission between f3 and f5 which is sampled by slice 6 .",
    "for this feature , the velocities are discordent with respect to the underlying disk ( see fig .",
    "[ pv ] ) and therefore do not satisfy the criteria listed above .",
    "particularly interesting about these very high latitude features is that there is little or no evidence for any lag in velocity with _ z _ , even to very high distances from the place .",
    "the features seen below the plane in slices 3 , 8 , and 9 and features seen above the plane in slices 9 and 10 show no velocity gradient .",
    "the early data of bottema ( 1989 ) also showed that the high latitude hi was co - rotating .",
    "there is some evidence , in our data , for curvature in the smaller features ( cf . slices 3 & 4 above the plane ) , but one could not make any case for a lag . the only slice which shows some evidence for lagging gas is slice 1 , but this slice is also closest to the tidal tail , confusing the interpretation .",
    "the averages of the advancing and receding sides of the galaxy also do not support the presence of a lagging halo . here , we see an asymmetry in the sense of many disk - halo features on the receding side , but the advancing side is dominated by the single -307 km s@xmath7 feature . none of the features , however , show a decline with _",
    "z_. we investigate this further in the next section .",
    "we have modeled the global hi density and velocity distributions for ngc  2613 following irwin & seaquist ( 1991 ) and irwin ( 1994 ) .",
    "this approach models all spectra in the hi cube by adopting a volume density distribution in and perpendicular to the plane , a rotation curve and velocity dispersion ( if required ) , and a position and orientation on the sky . given trial input parameters describing these distributions",
    ", the routine then varies the parameters , examining the residuals , until the best fit solution is found .",
    "various sections of the galaxy can be modeled , including galactocentric rings in the galaxy s plane . in the current version",
    ", we can also isolate slices parallel to the galaxy s plane .",
    "this permits modeling the halo , independent of the disk , which is important in this study in the event that a lagging hi halo might be present . while there is no evidence for lags in the discrete features shown in fig .",
    "[ pv ] , it is possible that the smooth , low intensity halo might be better fit with a lagging velocity distribution , similar to what has been found for ngc  2403 ( fraternali et al .",
    "the routine , called cubit , interfaces to classic aips ; potential users are requested to contact the first author for the code .    for ngc  2613 , the adopted in - plane density distribution is a gaussian ring , described by : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the galactocentric radius , @xmath15 is the galactocentric distance of the center of the ring , @xmath16 is the in - plane density at the center of the ring , and @xmath17 is the scale length .",
    "@xmath17 can have different values for points @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and for points @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the distribution perpendicular to the plane is given by the exponential , @xmath22 , where @xmath1 is the perpendicular distance from midplane and @xmath23 is the exponential scale height .",
    "the rotation curve is described by the brandt curve , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the galaxy s systemic velocity , @xmath26 is the peak of the rotation curve occurring at a galactocentric radius of @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the brandt index which is a shape parameter . a gaussian velocity dispersion , @xmath29 can also be applied , if needed .",
    "note that a velocity dispersion will result from all contributions to line widening along the entire line - of - sight direction , for example , any non - circular motions along the plane , streaming motions due to spiral arms and local turbulence .",
    "thus , @xmath29 may be larger than what might be expected from a local value .",
    "the above distributions result in 10 free parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath15 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , there are 4 more orientation parameters : the position of the galaxy center , ra(0 ) , dec(0 ) , the major axis position angle , pa , and the inclination , i. over the region of the cube occupied by ngc  2613 , there are 552 independent data points ( beam / velocity - channel resolution elements ) above a 2 @xmath12 intensity level in the combined c+d cube , so the 14 parameters are well constrained , over all .",
    "certain parameters may show a larger variation , however , depending on the nature of the distribution ; for example , @xmath27 tends to have a larger error since the point at which the rotation curve changes from rising to flat is not as well constrained by the data as some of the other parameters .",
    "table 2 lists the best fit modeled values for ngc  2613 for the combined c+d array data .",
    "we also modeled the c array data and d array data alone ; the error bars of table 2 reflect the variations in the parameters over the different arrays that result .",
    "given the range of resolution over these arrays , from 26.1@xmath9 @xmath30 20.2@xmath9 ( 3.3 @xmath30 2.5 kpc ) to 96.5@xmath9 @xmath30 42.9@xmath9 ( 12.1 @xmath30 5.4 kpc ) the error bars on the modeled parameters are very small .",
    "the best fit model is shown as dashed curves superimposed on the data in fig .",
    "[ pv ] . taking only residuals ( data cube - best fit model cube ) greater than 3@xmath12 ,",
    "the root - mean - square value is 1.77 mjy beam@xmath7 and the average relative error is @xmath4 10% . a zeroth moment map made from the cube of the residuals of the best fit is shown in fig .  [ residuals ] .    to determine whether there are changes in i , pa , and @xmath23 with galactocentric radius , r",
    ", we also modeled the galaxy in concentric rings .",
    "for example , either a lower value of i with increasing r ( a warp ) or a higher value of @xmath23 with increasing r ( i.e. a flare ) could conspire to make the halo of a galaxy appear to lag .",
    "we find that the inclination does not decrease with radius ( there is a slight increase ) .",
    "there is indeed evidence for flaring such that , in each data set , @xmath23 systematically increases with r. the most significant change is measured for the d array data alone such that the mean scale height between a radius of 140@xmath9 and 300@xmath9 ( 17.6 to 38 kpc ) is 5.5@xmath9 ( 693 pc ) compared to a value of 1.7@xmath9 ( 214 pc ) over the whole galaxy .",
    "thus , the disk is quite thin with a modest flare at large galactocentric radii .    in order to model the halo alone ,",
    "a variety of lower and upper cutoffs to _ z _ were applied and these data were modeled in a similar fashion .",
    "( note that _ z _ refers to the actual distance from the galaxy s midplane , not just the projected distance from the major axis . )",
    "the number of independent data points is reduced typically by about a factor of 3 , depending on which _ z _ limits are chosen , but we have also held some of the parameters ( the central position , position angle and systemic velocity ) fixed . for the halo models ,",
    "we find _ no _ evidence that @xmath26 could be lower at higher _",
    "z_. the same conclusion is reached if the c array and d array data are modeled independently .",

    "a distinct feature occurring at -307 km s@xmath7 ( see the advancing panel of fig .",
    "[ pv ] and fig .  [ channels ] ) has been mentioned in sect .",
    "[ disk - halo ] and extends to a ( negative ) _ z _ height of 22 kpc .",
    "( this feature is also distinguishable on the major axis pv slice of paper i ) .",
    "the channel maps show a complex structure below the plane , although two spurs dominate .",
    "the feature is very well defined in pv space and contributions to the feature can be seen in slices 6 through 9 which covers a range of 13 kpc in projected distance along the disk of ngc  2613 ( fig .",
    "[ moments]a ) .",
    "there is also a distinct height ( _ z _ @xmath4 90@xmath9 = 11 kpc ) at which the feature begins to widen abruptly in velocity ( fig .",
    "[ pv ] ) and also ( approximately ) spatially ( fig .  [ channels ] ) , a point we return to in the model of sect .",
    "[ buoyancy ] .",
    "further support for hi at high _ z _ at this position comes from early hi observations by bottema ( 1989 ) which show an hi  blob \" extending to @xmath4 25 kpc from the plane and sharing the rotation of the underlying disk .",
    "in addition , our low resolution 20 cm continuum map also shows a single large feature at this position extending 21 kpc from midplane ( irwin et al .",
    "thus , we will treat the -307 km s@xmath7 feature to be a single , coherent structure , as implied by its appearance in pv space , centered at a projected galactocentric distance of 15.5 kpc .",
    "this feature occurs over a restricted region of observed radial velocity ( @xmath31 = -307 @xmath32 30 km s@xmath7 ) . assuming that the feature originates in the disk ( see sect .",
    "[ very - high ] ) , this should allow us to place limits on the position along the line of sight from which it originates since the rotation curve of the galaxy is known .",
    "the galactocentric radius is given by @xmath33 ( ignoring sin @xmath34 = 0.98 ) where @xmath35 is the projected galactocentric radius and @xmath36 is the circular velocity at @xmath14 which is approximately constant in this part of the galaxy ( table 2 ) .",
    "allowing a @xmath3230 km s@xmath7 range on @xmath31 , the feature could therefore have originated from @xmath37 kpc or anywhere within @xmath32 7 kpc from this value along the line of sight , corresponding to a range of @xmath14 between 15.5 and 17 kpc . since the projected size of the feature is larger than this range ( fig .",
    "[ channels ] ) , it is likely that there has been some expansion with distance from the plane .    we can also put a limit on the age of the feature .",
    "gas which leaves the disk at an earlier time should have a component of line of sight velocity corresponding to the motion of the underlying disk at that time .",
    "as the disk rotates , gas which leaves later may have a different line of sight velocity component .",
    "consequently , there may be a gradual change in observed velocity with height ( increasing or decreasing ) depending on geometry .",
    "since we see no such change , we can use the velocity half - width of the feature , 30 km s@xmath7 , to place a limit on the angle over which the underlying disk has rotated over the age of the feature .",
    "we find that the feature must have formed over a timescale which is less than the time required for the disk to rotate @xmath32 24@xmath38 at galactocentric radii between 15.5 and 17 kpc . from the circular velocity in this region ,",
    "the corresponding timescale is 4.2 @xmath30 10@xmath39 yr .",
    "these arguments will depend on how the ejected gas may or may not be coupled to the disk and should be considered order of magnitude only .",
    "nevertheless , the result is similar to the kinematic ages found for expanding supershells in other galaxies ( cf . king & irwin 1997 , lee & irwin 1997 , lee et al .",
    "basically the `` straightness '' of the feature in pv space requires that the feature have an age @xmath40 the rotation period .",
    "the mass of this feature , as measured in pv space to the level at which the feature blends with the disk , is ( @xmath41 m@xmath3 .",
    "approximating the feature as a cylinder of height , 22 kpc , width and depth , 13 kpc , the mean density is @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "( reducing the diameter of the cylinder to 7.3 kpc ( 150@xmath9 ) results in a mean density of @xmath44 @xmath43 . )",
    "if the feature has reached a _",
    "z _ height of 22 kpc in 4.2 @xmath30 10@xmath39 yr , the implied mean outflow velocity is 512 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding hi mass outflow rate would be 1.9 m@xmath3 yr@xmath7 .",
    "we can also compute the potential energy of this feature ( see lee et al .",
    "2001 ) which requires a knowledge of the mid - plane stellar density and scale height .",
    "comparing the rotation curve of ngc  2613 ( chaves & irwin 2001 ) to that of the milky way ( sofue & rubin 2001 ) , ngc  2613 is a factor of 4 more massive , and factor of 2 larger in radius .",
    "ngc  2613 also has a thinner disk , if we take the thickness of the hi disk ( 188 pc , table 2 ) to be representative of the stellar thickness .",
    "scaling the mid - plane stellar density from the galactic value ( 0.185 m@xmath3 pc@xmath45 ) yields 0.74 m@xmath3 pc@xmath45 for ngc  2613 and adopting 100@xmath9 ( 12.6 kpc ) ( about half the full _ z _ extent ) to be representative of the height of the feature above the plane , we find a potential energy of 1.5 @xmath30 10@xmath5 ergs for the -307 km s@xmath7 feature .",
    "thus , energy of this order is required to transport the cool gas to the heights observed .",
    "although very large , this value is not unlike that determined for the largest supershells in other edge - on galaxies ( cf . an input energy of @xmath4 3 @xmath30 10@xmath5 ergs for ngc  3556 , king & irwin 1997 ) .",

    "1997 ) . in ngc  5775 ( i = 86@xmath38 )",

    "given the presence of lagging halos in these other galaxies and also some theoretical expectation of lags ( cf .",
    "bregman 1980 , benjamin 2002 , collins et al .",
    "2002 ) , the absence of a lagging velocity gradient along the discrete features ( sect .",
    "[ disk - halo ] ) and the absence of a global lag ( sect .",
    "[ models ] ) in ngc  2613 require comment .",
    "firstly , given the inclination of this galaxy ( 79@xmath38 , table 2 ) and its hi radius of @xmath4 35 kpc , the discrete features must reach a height of _ z _ @xmath47 6.5 kpc before they will be seen beyond the projection of the disk . if it is true that lags only exist up to 3 to 6 kpc and above this",
    "there is no longer a lag ( see above ) , then lags ( if they exist ) along the discrete features would be projected against the background disk .",
    "this would make a velocity gradient ( if present ) impossible to detect along the discrete features .",
    "the ` straightness ' of the -307 km s@xmath7 feature in velocity ( fig .  [ pv ] ) to such high latitudes beyond the projection of the disk is , however , quite remarkable .",
    "if this feature emerges into a hot x - ray corona , as suggested in sect .",
    "[ buoyancy ] , then either the velocity of the broad - scale x - ray corona is not appreciably different from the underlying disk ( although the velocity dispersion is likely much higher ) , or the timescale over which it could appreciably affect this gas column is greater than the age of the feature .    as for a globally lagging halo , our kinematical model is indeed capable of detecting such a lag , even if it is projected against the disk ( see sect .",
    "[ models ] ) provided there is sufficient high latitude emission that halo gas can be detected at all .",
    "what we have found , however , is that ngc  2613 does not have an hi thick disk or halo",
    ". the vertical exponential scale height ( 188 pc , table 2 ) indicates that the disk is , in fact , thin .",
    "if we create a model galaxy using the parameters of table 2 , it is straightforward to show that emission from all high latitude ( _ z _ @xmath47 1 kpc ) hi in fact falls below the map noise .",
    "thus , ngc  2613 does not have a detectable lagging halo because it does not have a halo at all .    as a further comparative test , we consider the hi halo of another galaxy at the same distance , ngc  5775 ( i = 86@xmath38 , d = 25 mpc ) , for which we detected an hi halo with exponential scale height of 9.14@xmath9 ( 1.1 kpc ) using the same technique ( irwin 1994 ) .",
    "if we create a model for the lower inclination ( i = 79@xmath38 ) ngc  2613 in which the vertical density distribution declines exponentially from its in - disk value with the same scale height as ngc  5775 , we find that it could easily have been detected , even at the lower inclination of ngc  2613 .",
    "this result illustrates the importance of using a model , rather than pv slices alone , in drawing conclusions about the possible existence of lagging halos .",
    "for example , the model can disentangle inclination effects from the effects of a thick disk .",
    "for ngc  2613 , since the modeled inclination is now known to be on the low end of the range quoted in chaves & irwin ( 2000 ) , our earlier conclusion of a lag with _ z _ can now be largely explained by projection against the background disk .",
    "this is succintly illustrated via the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ pv ] which show that our thin disk model provides an almost perfect fit to the data .",
    "we have argued elsewhere ( paper i ) , largely on the basis of above / below plane symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ carray ] ) , that the observed features are internally generated and represent outflows .",
    "while these new data show that the galaxy is indeed interacting , it is unlikely that most of the observed features are produced via cloud impacts since the cloud would have to pass completely through the disk , forming similar structures on both sides , in contrast to what is expected theoretically ( see santilln et al .",
    "anomalous velocities are also more likely in the case of impacts , whereas the velocities observed in ngc  2613 are typical of the underlying disk .",
    "thus , the new data are consistent with the outflow interpretation .",
    "we can not , however , rule out the possibility of some impacting clouds in this system and it is also possible that the interaction may assist in the process of disk - halo dynamics , for example via stimulating a starburst or instabilities such as the parker instability .",
    "if the features are internally generated , their very large sizes ( _ z _ up to 28 kpc , sect . [ disk - halo ] imply exceptional energies ( @xmath4 10@xmath5 ergs ) which are difficult to conceive of , especially at large distances from the nuclear vicinity and in a galaxy which is not a starburst .",
    "this energy problem has been known since the first detections of heiles shells in the milky way ( heiles 1979 , 1984 ) and has generated suggestions as far ranging as multiple supernovae and stellar winds ( heckman 2001 ) , gamma ray bursters ( efremov et al .",
    "1998 , loeb & perna 1998 ) , and jet bubbles ( gopal - krishna & irwin 2000 ) to help explain the high energies . in the following section , we suggest that the exceptional heights achieved by the features in ngc  2613 may be as much a result of the environment into which the features emerge , as to the input source itself .",
    "the -307 km s@xmath7 feature ( fig .  [ pv ] , advancing ) is remarkable in its well defined structure , in the very high latitude ( 22 kpc ) that it achieves , and in its sudden and dramatic widening and break up in velocity at a height of @xmath4 11 kpc . in individual slices ( see slices 8 and 9 , in particular ) , this velocity widening gives the feature a mushroom - like appearance and is reminiscent of buoyant gas rising through a higher density medium .",
    "a precedent for this kind of behaviour is the 350 pc galactic mushroom discovered in canadian galactic plane survey data and which has been interpreted in terms of buoyant outflow ( english et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "given this similarity , we here consider whether buoyant outflow could explain the observed high latitude discrete hi features in ngc  2613 .",
    "we present the following as a feasibility study only to see whether the results provide a reasonable match to the data using realistic parameters .",
    "we consider a match to the -307 km s@xmath7 feature only , at this time , since it is the clearest case amongst the disk halo features in ngc  2613 ; however , if the model is correct , it must clearly apply to the other features as well .",
    "a similar development has been presented by avillez & mac low ( 2001 ) for smaller features like the galactic mushroom , but we here consider much larger scales ( many kpc ) , and also include the effects of drag .",
    "the scenario envisioned is one in which a hot , x - ray emitting corona already exists around the galaxy , possibly set up via venting through previous fountain or chimney activity .",
    "some event or events occur within the disk which are sufficiently energetic to produce blow - out . the hi is already entrained or swept up in some way by the time the outflow emerges into the halo .",
    "an initial velocity ( i.e. the velocity at blow - out ) could be present but is not included here .",
    "thus , the velocities achieved in the plume are a result only of buoyant forces .",
    "the attraction of this model is that , rather than requiring that all of the energy in the hi plume be supplied by the instigating event in the disk ( @xmath48 ergs , sect .",
    "[ 307feature ] ) , we require only enough energy to produce the blow - out condition ( e.g. @xmath49 ergs , tomisaka 1998 ) . the remaining energy is extracted from the pressure gradient in the hot coronal gas .",
    "ultimately , the galaxy s potential itself is providing the energy source .",
    "although we do not investigate the details of the entrainment or sweeping up of hi , we assume that the hot gas inside the plume carries the cool hi with it and that the density of the hi declines with _ z _ in a fashion similar to the hot buoyant plume material . in this feasibility study",
    ", we do not consider structure in the corona or outflow plume , other than the cylindrical geometry chosen for the plume , and also neglect the effects of shocks .",
    "the integrity of the hi in the presence of hot gas will be considered in the next section .",

    "photoionization of the hi by starlight should be negligible , considering the high galactic latitudes achieved . as pointed out by murali ( 2000 ) ,",

    "[ introduction ] .",
    "we have so far considered only whether buoyancy is feasible",
    ". there may be other dynamics at work as well ( for example , an initial velocity at blow - out or magnetic fields ) and the proposed hot corona is also unlikely to have the smooth distributions postulated here .",
    "nevertheless , in the context of the model , it is interesting to predict the x - ray luminosity of the corona in the vicinity of the plume .",
    "the results of table 3 show that it is feasible to transfer large masses to high galactic latitudes via buoyancy in a postulated x - ray corona .",
    "this drastically reduces the computed input energy requirements since it is no longer necessary to eject large masses to high altitudes .",
    "it is only necessary to achieve blow - out through the thin hi disk of ngc  2613 .",
    "the conditions required for blow - out have been investigated by a variety of authors ( see tomisaka 1998 , for example ) but energy requirements are typically of order 10@xmath127 ergs , rather than the 10@xmath5 ergs that would normally be required for the -307 km s@xmath7 feature .    while the details of the interaction between the hi and hot outflowing gas are beyond the scope of this paper , it is important to ask whether there would originally have been sufficient hi in the disk from which the 8 @xmath30 10@xmath39 m@xmath3 in the -307 km s@xmath7 feature could have been swept up .",
    "assuming cylinderical geometry , a disk region of radius ,",
    "6.5 kpc ( sect .  [ 307feature ] ) and using the modeled density and thickness of the disk ( table 2 ) , the available hi mass is @xmath4 3 @xmath30 10@xmath128 m@xmath3 suggesting that @xmath4 26% of the disk mass is swept up .",
    "this fraction would be higher for cone - like outflow .",
    "we should also consider whether the mass outflow rate is consistent with that of a galactic fountain .",
    "the estimated hi mass outflow rate ( sect .",
    "[ 307feature ] , sect .",
    "[ buoyancy ] ) is @xmath4 1 to 2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath7 .",
    "thus , the combined hi + hot gas outflow rate will be of order several m@xmath3 yr@xmath7 .",
    "collins et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have estimated the mass flow rate for the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) component in a galactic fountain , assuming a ballistic model of gas clouds .",

    "it is not yet clear , however , whether these galactic fountain values can be directly scaled to the relevant regions of ngc  2613 .",
    "it may be that some additional source of pressure is still required , for example , magnetic fields in the form of a parker instability .",
    "if such fields continue to rise into the corona , the inclusion of this magnetic pressure would relax ( i.e. lower ) the density or temperature requirements internal to the plume ( table 3 ) .",
    "new vla d array data of ngc  2613 have been combined with previous higher resolution observations ( chaves & irwin 2001 ) to show a more extensive hi distribution than previously observed .",
    "the galaxy is now seen to have a tidal tail on its eastern side due to an interaction with its companion , eso  495-g017 , to the north - west .",
    "the three - dimensional hi distribution in ngc  2613 has been modeled following irwin & seaquist ( 1991 ) and irwin ( 1994 ) , a method which allows the volume density distribution to be determined as well as the scale height and inclination to be disentangled .",
    "we find that the inclination of the galaxy ( 79@xmath38 ) is on the low end of the range given in chaves & irwin ( 2001 ) and the model now shows that there is no hi halo in ngc  2613 .",
    "rather , the global hi distribution is well fit by a thin disk of exponential scale height , @xmath132 = 188 pc .",
    "the use of such a model is very important in drawing conclusions about the presence or absence of a global halo in a galaxy of this inclination .",
    "previous reports of a lagging halo from pv slices alone can largely be attributed to projection against the background disk .    while there is no significant global hi halo in ngc  2613 ,",
    "there are more discrete disk - halo hi features than previously detected and these hi features achieve extremely high latitudes .",
    "even though a tidal interaction is occurring , we suggest that most of the discrete kpc - scale features have been produced internally rather than from impacting clouds , although we do not rule out the possiblity of the companion galaxy having some indirect effect ( e.g. triggering instabilities ) . the presence of many discrete features may be related to the fact that the global hi disk is thin , favouring blow - out .",
    "the observed _ z _ heights are quite remarkable ( e.g. up to 28 kpc ) .",
    "the -307 km s@xmath7 feature , in particular , below the plane on the advancing side , reaching 22 kpc in @xmath133 height and of total mass , ( 8 @xmath32 2 ) @xmath30 10@xmath39 m@xmath3 , is very obvious and well - defined in pv space .",
    "its center is likely close to its projected radius of 15.5 kpc and it extends over a large ( @xmath32 7 kpc radius ) projected galactocentric radius .",
    "if this feature has achieved its @xmath133 height as a result of internal processes , then extremely large energies are required , @xmath4 10@xmath5 ergs .",
    "given the very high input energies required for the -307 km s@xmath7 feature , its resemblance to smaller buoyant features ( cf . the galactic mushroom , english et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the fact that x - ray halos are being found around an increasing number of star forming spiral galaxies , we have carried out a feasibility study as to whether this feature can be interpreted as an adiabatic buoyant plume .",
    "the observed hi would be carried out by a hot , low density outflowing gas and , after having achieved blowout , would rise through a hot pre - existing x - ray corona . a reasonable example ( model 5 ) , has a mean plume temperature and density of @xmath134 k and 5.5 @xmath30 10@xmath45 @xmath43 rising into a hot isothermal corona of temperature and mean density , @xmath135 k and 0.035 @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "these conditions produce a stall height of 11 kpc which is where the observed plume widens in velocity and position space .",

    "the maximum outflow velocity in this model is 290 km s@xmath7 and it reaches the stall height in 5.4@xmath9710@xmath39 yrs .",

    "the advantage of such a model is that the energy requirements from the initial event are drastically reduced to being only what is required for blowout , a reduction of several orders of magnitude .",
    "the energy is largely extracted from the gravitational potential of the galaxy rather than the initial event within the disk .",
    "the behaviour of the plume should sample the parameters of the x - ray corona .",

    "<S> we combine new vla d array hi data of ngc  2613 with previous high resolution data to show new disk - halo features in this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the global hi distribution is modeled in detail using a technique which can disentangle the effects of inclination from scale height and can also solve for the average volume density distribution in and perpendicular to the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the model shows that the galaxy s inclination is on the low end of the range given by chaves & irwin ( 2001 ) and that the hi disk is thin ( @xmath0 = 188 pc ) , showing no evidence for halo .    </S>",
    "<S> numerous discrete disk - halo features are observed , however , achieving @xmath1 heights up to 28 kpc from mid - plane . </S>",
    "<S> one prominent feature in particular , of mass , @xmath2 m@xmath3 and height , 22 kpc , is seen on the advancing side of the galaxy at a projected galactocentric radius of 15.5 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> if this feature achieves such high latitudes because of events in the disk alone , then input energies of order @xmath4 10@xmath5 ergs are required . </S>",
    "<S> we have instead investigated the feasibility of such a large feature being produced via buoyancy ( with drag ) within a hot , pre - existing x - ray corona . </S>",
    "<S> reasonable plume densities , temperatures , stall height ( @xmath4 11 kpc ) , outflow velocities and ages can indeed be achieved in this way . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this scenario is that the input energy need only be sufficient to produce blow - out , a condition which requires a reduction of three orders of magnitude in energy . </S>",
    "<S> if this is correct , there should be an observable x - ray halo around ngc  2613 .    </S>",
