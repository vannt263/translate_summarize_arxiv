    "[ [ motivation - and - previous - work ] ] motivation and previous work    topological data analysis aims at finding and reasoning about the underlying topological features of metric spaces .",
    "the idea is to represent a data set by a set of discrete structures on a range of scales and to track the evolution of homological features as the scale varies .",
    "the theory of _ persistent _ homology allows for a topological summary , called the _ persistence diagram _ which summarizes the lifetimes of topological features in the data as the scale under consideration varies monotonously .",
    "a major step in the computation of this topological signature is the question of how to compute a _",
    "filtration _ , that is , a multi - scale representation of a given data set .    for data in the form of finite point clouds ,",
    "two frequently used constructions are the _",
    "( vietoris-)rips _ complex @xmath11 and the _ ech _ complex @xmath12 which are defined with respect to a scale parameter @xmath13 . both are simplicial complexes capturing the proximity of points at scale @xmath14 , with different levels of accuracy .",
    "increasing @xmath14 from @xmath15 to @xmath16 yields a nested sequence of simplicial complexes called a _",
    "filtration_.    unfortunately , rips and ech filtrations can be uncomfortably large to handle . for homological features in low dimensions",
    ", it suffices to consider the @xmath4-skeleton of the complex , that is , all simplices of dimension at most @xmath4 .",
    "still , the @xmath4-skeleton of rips and echcomplexes can be as large as @xmath17 for @xmath0 points , which is already impractical for small @xmath4 when @xmath0 is large .",
    "one remedy is to construct an _ approximate filtration _",
    ", that is , a filtration that yields a similar topological signature as the original filtration but is significantly smaller in size .",
    "the notion of `` similarity '' in this context can be made formal through a distance measure on persistence diagrams .",
    "the most frequently used similarity measure is the _ bottleneck distance _ , which finds correspondences between topological features of two filtrations , such that the lifetimes of each pair of matched features are as close as possible .",
    "a related notion is the _ log - scale bottleneck distance _ which allows a larger discrepancy for larger scales and thus can be seen as a relative approximation , with usual bottleneck distance as its absolute counterpart .",
    "we call an approximate filtration a _ @xmath18-approximation _ of the original , if their persistence diagrams have log - scale bottleneck distance at most @xmath18",
    ".    sheehy  @xcite gave the first such approximate filtration for rips complexes with a formal guarantee .",
    "for @xmath19 , he constructs a @xmath7-approximate filtration of the rips filtration .",
    "the size of its @xmath4-skeleton is only @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the doubling dimension of the metric .",
    "since then , several alternative technique have been explored for rips  @xcite and echcomplexes  @xcite , all arriving at the same complexity bound .",
    "while the above approaches work well for instances where @xmath21 and @xmath4 are small , we focus on high - dimensional point sets .",
    "this has two reasons : first , one might simply want to analyze data sets for which the intrinsic dimension is high , but the existing methods do not succeed in reducing the complex size sufficiently .",
    "second , even for medium - size dimensions , one might not want to restrict its scope to the low - homology features , so that @xmath22 is not an unreasonable parameter choice . to adapt the aforementioned schemes to play nice with high dimensional point clouds",
    ", it makes sense to use dimension reduction results to eliminate the dependence on @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , it has been shown , in analogy to the famous johnson - lindenstrauss lemma  @xcite , that an orthogonal projection to a @xmath23-dimensional subspace yields another @xmath7 approximate filtration  @xcite .",
    "combining these two approximation schemes , however , yields an approximation of size @xmath24 ( ignoring @xmath25-factors ) and does not improve upon the exact case .",
    "[ [ our - contributions ] ] our contributions    we present two results about the approximation of rips and echfiltrations : we give a scheme for approximating the rips filtration with smaller complex size than existing approaches , at the price of guaranteeing only an approximation quality of @xmath26 .",
    "since rips and echfiltrations approximate each other by a constant factor , our result also extends to the echfiltration , with an additional constant factor in the approximation quality .",
    "second , we prove that any approximation scheme for the echfiltration has superpolynomial size in @xmath0 if high accuracy is required . for this result , our proof technique does not extend to rips complexes . in more detail ,",
    "our results are as follows : * upper bound * : we present a @xmath27-approximation of the rips filtration for @xmath0 points in @xmath28 whose @xmath4-skeleton has a size of @xmath29 on each scale .",
    "this shows that by using a more rough approximation , we can achieve asymptotic improvements on the complex size .",
    "the real power of our approach reveals itself in high dimensions , in combination with dimension reduction techniques . in conjunction with the lemma of johnson and lindenstrauss  @xcite",
    ", we obtain an @xmath30-approximation with size @xmath31 at any scale , which is much smaller than the original filtration ; however , for the complete case @xmath32 , the bound is still super - polynomial in @xmath0 . combined with a different dimension reduction result of matouek  @xcite",
    ", we obtain a @xmath33-approximation of size @xmath6 .",
    "this is the first polynomial bound in @xmath0 of an approximate filtration , independent of the dimensionality of the point set . for inputs from arbitrary metric spaces ( instead of points in @xmath28 ) ,",
    "the same results hold with an additional @xmath30 factor in the approximation quality .",
    "our approximations are discrete , and the number of scales that have to be considered is determined by the logarithm of the spread of the point set ( the ratio of diameter and closest point distance ) . in this work",
    ", we tacitly assume the spread to be constant , and concentrate on the complex size on a fixed scale as our quality measurement .",
    "* lower bound * : we construct a point set of @xmath0 points in @xmath34 dimensions whose echfiltration has @xmath8 persistent features with `` relatively long '' lifetime .",
    "precisely , that means that any @xmath35-approximation has to contain a bar of non - zero length for each of those features if @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "this shows that it is impossible to define an approximation scheme that yields an accurate approximation of the echcomplexes as well as polynomial size in @xmath0 .    * methods * : our results follow from a link to lattice geometry : the @xmath38-lattice is a configuration of points in @xmath28 which realizes the thinnest known coverings for low dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the dual voronoi polytope of a lattice point is the _ permutahedron _ , whose vertices are obtained by all coordinate permutations of a fixed point in @xmath28 .",
    "our technique resembles the perhaps simplest approximation scheme for point sets : if we digitize @xmath28 with @xmath39-dimensional pixels , we can take the union of pixels that contain input points as our approximation .",
    "our approach does the same , except that we use a tessellation of permutahedra for digitization . in @xmath40",
    ", our approach corresponds to the common approach of replacing the square tiling by a hexagonal tiling .",
    "we exploit that the permutahedral tessellation is in generic position , that is , no more than @xmath41 polytopes have a common intersection . at the same time , permutahedra are still relatively round , that is , they have small diameter and non - adjacent polytopes are well - separated .",
    "these properties ensure good approximation quality and a small complex . in comparison , a cubical tessellation yields a @xmath42-approximate rips filtration which looks like an improvement over our @xmath2-approximation , but the highly degenerate configuration of the cubes yields a complex size of @xmath43 , and therefore does not constitute an improvement over sheehy s approach  @xcite .    for the lower bound , we arrange @xmath0 points in a way that one center point has the permutahedron as voronoi polytope , and we consider simplices incident to that center point in a fixed dimension . we show a superpolynomial number of these simplices create or destroy topological features of non - negligible persistence .    [ [ outline - of - the - paper ] ] outline of the paper    we begin by reviewing basics of persistent homology in section  [ section : backgnd ] .",
    "next , we study several relevant properties of the @xmath44 lattice in section  [ section : permuto ] .",
