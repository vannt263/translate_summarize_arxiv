    "hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) discovered recently are mainly b type stars with mass @xmath0-@xmath1 and radial velocities up to @xmath2 escaping away from the galactic halo @xcite .",

    "* ) .    to determine which mechanism should be responsible for the detected hvss is an important issue in understanding the stellar dynamics around the central mbh",
    "some observational properties of hvss , such as the binarity , rotational velocity , metallicity , ejection rate / observed frequency , spatial and velocity distribution , etc . ,",

    "however , one uncertain factor in these mechanisms is where the initial progenitors come from .",
    "different origins of the hvs progenitors may also result in different distributions of hvs properties , especially their spatial distribution and the velocity distribution .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to address this problem through monte carlo numerical simulations under the constraints from current observations .",
    "the spatial distribution of the detected hvss is compatible with both the tbk and the bbh mechanism if the progenitors of these hvss are originated from disk - like structures in the vicinity of the central mbh ( e.g. , the clockwise rotating young stellar ( cws ) disk in the gc ) .",
    "the preliminary results that demonstrate the disk(s ) origination of the hvs progenitors have been summarized in @xcite .",
    "we shall further demonstrate in this paper that an isotropic distribution of hvs progenitors is inconsistent with the spatial distribution of the detected hvss if they are originated from the gc .",
    "however , the disk(s ) origination of the detected hvss is consistent with the distribution of the inclination angles ( relative to the disk(s ) ) of the detected hvss which further strengthen the conclusions made in @xcite .",
    "the velocity distribution of hvss is related to not only the production mechanism but also the origin of their progenitors .",
    "@xcite have studied the velocity distribution of hvss .",
    "they found that the velocity distribution of hvss produced by the tbk mechanism for unbound injecting stellar binaries seems to be consistent with the then detected hvss though with limited statistics , while the hvs velocity distribution produced by the bbh mechanism appears to be too flat in comparison with the observations .",
    "their results suggest that the hvs velocity distribution may be useful in distinguishing the ejection mechanisms . in this paper",
    ", we shall further investigate the effects on the velocity distribution of hvss due to different origins of the hvs progenitors , e.g. , those ( binary ) stars initially unbound to the mbh but later injected into the immediate vicinity of the mbh due to some unknown perturbations , and those ( binary ) stars initially bound to the mbh but later evolved onto highly eccentric orbits and migrated into the immediate vicinity of the mbh .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "obs ] , we first summarize the observational results on the spatial and velocity distribution of the detected hvss . in section  [ sec : tbk ] , we explore the detailed dynamics of interactions between binary stars on bound orbits and a central mbh .",
    "the consequences of these interactions are different from that between the unbound binary stars on parabolic ( or hyperbolic ) orbits and the mbh intensively investigated in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reason is that the stellar binary may experience multiple close encounters with the mbh in the former case , while it only experiences a single close encounter in the latter case .",
    "assuming realistic distributions of the properties of the initial stellar binaries , we then simulate both the spatial distribution and the velocity distribution of hvss produced by the tbk mechanism and compare the numerical results with the observations in section  [ sec : result ] . in section  [ sec : bbh ] , we also explore the interactions between single stars on bound orbits with a hypothesized bbh in the gc .",
    "these single stars are assumed to be injected into the immediate vicinity of the bbh from disk - like stellar structures ( e.g. , the cws disk ) surrounding the bbh , which is different from that adopted in @xcite . with reasonable but simple assumptions on the parameters of the hypothetical bbh ,",
    "the spatial and velocity distributions of the ejected hvss are obtained .",
    "comparison between the simulation results and the observations are also discussed in section  [ sec : bbh ] .",
    "the conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "surveys of hvss have detected 16 hvss unbound to the galactic halo , 8 bound hvss , and 4 hvs candidates @xcite .",
    "we summarize their spatial and velocity distributions in this section .",
    "the spatial distribution of the hvss detected so far is probably anisotropic @xcite .",
    "@xcite use great circles to fit the spatial distribution of the detected hvss projected on the sky of an observer located at the gc , and they find that the distribution can be best fitted by two great circles .",
    "their results suggest that the spatial distribution of the detected hvss is consistent with being located on the planes of two thin disks @xcite : ( 1 ) eleven of the unbound hvss ( plus four bound ones and two candidates ; totally 17 objects ) are spatially associated to a thin disk plane with an orientation almost the same as that of cws disk located within half a parsec from the central mbh ( see @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) four of the unbound hvss ( plus three bound ones and two candidates ; totally 9 objects ) are spatially associated to a thin disk plane with an orientation similar to that of the northern arm of the minispiral ( or also the outer warped part of the cws disk ) in the gc .",
    "the normals of the best - fit disk planes for these two hvs populations are ( @xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath5(@xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) in galactic coordinates , respectively @xcite . hereafter , we refer to those detected hvss associated with the above two best - fit planes as the first population and the second population of hvss , respectively .",
    "we denote the inclination angle of each hvs to its corresponding best - fit plane by @xmath10 and describe the spatial distribution of the hvss by a normalized cumulative distribution function of their inclination angles @xmath11 ( hereafter , @xmath10cdf ) , which represents the number fraction of the hvss with inclination angles higher than @xmath10 .",
    "the observational @xmath10cdfs for both populations of the hvss are shown in figure  [ fig : f1 ] and will be compared with the distributions obtained from numerical models in sections [ sec : result ] and [ sec : bbh ] . for each population",
    ", we shall compare the @xmath11 of all the hvss ( including unbound hvss , bound hvss , and hvs candidates ) instead of only unbound ones , because ( 1 ) for the first hvs population , our kolmogorov@xmath12smirnov ( k - s ) test finds a likelihood of @xmath13 that the unbound hvss and all the hvss are drawn from the same @xmath10cdf ; ( 2 ) for the second population , the number of the unbound hvss is only 4 and the error due to poisson noise in the @xmath10cdf is substantial , therefore we do not show their @xmath10cdf in figure  [ fig : f1 ] ( and @xmath14cdf in figure  [ fig : f2 ] below , either ) .",
    "the gravitational potential of the galaxy is not exactly spherical , and its non - spherical component may deflect the radial trajectories of hvss after they were ejected from the gc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the distance and the velocity span ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 , see section  [ subsec : vd ] ) of the detected hvss , however , the deviation due to the flattening of the galactic disk and the triaxiality of the galactic halo is at most several degrees ( typically @xmath17 ) as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "compared with the standard deviation of @xmath10 ( @xmath18 ) shown in figure  [ fig : f1 ] , that small deviation can be ignored .",
    "the detected hvss have been decelerated in the galactic gravitational potential after they were ejected from the gc . to easily compare with results obtained from theoretical models and see the dependence of hvs velocity distributions on different ejection mechanisms , we first remove the velocity deceleration ( caused by the galactic bulge , the disk , and the halo ; see below ) from their observed values with correction for the proper motion and then obtain their velocities at infinity by assuming that they move from the gc to the infinity only in the gravitational potential of the central mbh .",
    "we denote these hvs velocities at infinity by @xmath19 , and their cdf @xmath20 ( hereafter , @xmath14cdf ) represents the number fraction of hvss which have velocities at infinity higher than @xmath19 .",
    "generally , the galactic gravitational potential can be described by four components , @xmath21 , i.e. , the contribution from the central mbh , the galactic bulge , the disk , and the halo .",
    "we have @xmath22 , where the mass of the central mbh in the gc is adopted to be @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the model for the last three components from @xcite , i.e. , _ bulge = - , with @xmath24 and the core radius @xmath25 , _ disk = - , [ eq : fdisc ] with @xmath26 and the scale length @xmath27 , and _ halo = - ( 1 + ) , with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the cosmic critical density , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the cosmic fraction of matter , the virial radius @xmath32 , and the concentration @xmath33 . to see",
    "the velocity deceleration of a star caused by the bulge , disk and halo potentials above , the minimum velocity required for the star starting from the potential center ( in the absence of the mbh ) is @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath2 ) so that they can move to a distance of @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) further away . with the galactic potential model",
    "above , we correct the velocity deceleration and obtain the @xmath14cdfs for both hvs populations , which are shown in figure  [ fig : f2 ] .    in the estimation of @xmath19 above",
    ", we adopted the spherical approximation of the galactic disk potential given by equation ( 2 ) , since all the detected hvss are moving at galactocentric distances much larger than the disk scale length @xmath4 . if using the miyamoto@xmath12nagai potential @xcite to describe the flattened potential of the galactic disk , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the scale length and height of the disk are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , respectively , we find that the difference in the estimated @xmath43 due to the disk flattening is negligible ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "adopting a different galactic potential model may result in a different @xmath14cdf .",
    "for example , choosing the galactic potential as that given by equation ( 8) in @xcite , the resulted @xmath19 ranges from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , which is substantially higher than that shown in figure  [ fig : f2 ] ( from @xmath47 to @xmath48 ) .",
    "however , the slope of the @xmath14cdf in this velocity range is only slightly flatter than that estimated from the potential given by ( @xcite ; also see discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , our conclusions made in sections  [ sec : result ] and [ sec : bbh ] on comparisons of the simulated @xmath14cdf ( mainly the shape ) with the estimated @xmath14cdf here are not sensitive to the choice of the galactic potential ( see further discussions in section  [ subsubsec : veltbk ] ) .",
    "note here that the galactocentric distances of the detected hvss range from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , which correspond to their travel time from the gc ranging from a few tens to @xmath51  myr .",
    "the progenitors of the detected hvss are probably originated from disk - like stellar structures in the gc ( e.g. , the cws disk ) as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "these progenitors are likely to be bound to the central mbh . in order to investigate whether the statistical distribution of the detected hvss shown in section  [ sec : obs ] can be reproduced by the tbk mechanism , here",
    "we first explore the detailed physics of the tidal breakup of binary stars that initially bound to the central mbh as it is still elusive in the literature .",
    "consider that the binary star is moving on an eccentric orbit bound to the mbh and injecting / migrating into the vicinity of the mbh .",
    "for convenience , we denote the injecting / migrating stellar binary by the `` stellar '' binary with semimajor axis @xmath52 , eccentricity @xmath53 , and mass @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the masses of its two components , respectively ) .",
    "the center of mass of the stellar binary and the mbh also compose a binary system , which we denote by the `` outer '' binary with semimajor axis @xmath57 and eccentricity @xmath58 .      we perform three - body experiments of dynamical interactions between stellar binaries and the central mbh .",
    "we use the code dorpi5 based on the explicit fifth(fourth)-order runge@xmath12kutta method @xcite to integrate the set of the equations that control the three - body interactions between the stellar binary and the mbh .",
    "we set the tolerance of the fractional energy error to be @xmath59 for a single orbit integration .",
    "we have also checked that statistically our results are not affected by setting a smaller minimum tolerance of the energy error .",
    "the initial conditions set for the stellar and the outer binaries include ( 1 ) the masses of the two components of the stellar binary ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath60 ) and its mass ratio @xmath61 ; ( 2 ) the initial semimajor axis and eccentricity of the stellar binary ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) ; ( 3 ) the initial semimajor axis and eccentricity of the outer binary ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) ; ( 4 ) the orbital orientations of both the stellar and outer binaries ; and ( 5 ) the initial orbital phases of both the stellar and outer binaries .    for convenience , we also define a dimensionless penetration parameter @xmath66 to describe how close a stellar binary can approach the mbh relative to its tidal breakup radius @xmath67 ( see a similar definition in @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath68^{-1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the initial pericenter distance and @xmath70^{1/3 } a_{\\rm b , i}$ ] .",
    "the penetration parameter @xmath71 corresponds to the tidal breakup radius of a stellar binary , and the range of @xmath66 of interest in this paper is @xmath72 where tidal breakup of stellar binaries is possible .      for the numerical experiments in sections  [ subsec : first ] and [ subsec : multi ] , we simply set the mass ratio of the stellar binary as @xmath73 , and @xmath74 ; but for those in section  [ sec : result ] we adopt more realistic distributions of the mass ratio and the masses of the two components of the stellar binaries according to current observations on binary stars .",
    "we set the initial semimajor axis @xmath62 of the stellar binary in the range from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "yr @xcite . if these binaries are rotating around the mbh with semimajor axis of @xmath77  pc as adopted in this paper , the total time for @xmath78 orbits is roughly @xmath79  yr . therefore , the evolution of stellar binaries due to their dynamical interactions with background stars can be safely ignored . ]",
    "perturbations on a binary star with @xmath80 from the tidal field of the mbh easily lead to the merger of its two components ; while tidal breakup of binary stars with @xmath81 usually leads to ejections of stars with velocities substantially smaller than the hypervelocities interested in this paper .",
    "for demonstration only , we simply choose @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( or 0.1 , 0.3 , and 0.6 alternatively ) in the three - body experiments presented in sections  [ subsec : first ] and [ subsec : multi ] ; but in section  [ sec : result ] , we adopt a distribution of @xmath62 based on the constraint obtained from current observations and @xmath83 .",
    "we set the semimajor axis of the outer binary as @xmath840.04@xmath120.5@xmath85 @xcite , as the stellar binaries are possibly originated from the cws disk within half a parsec from the central mbh .",
    "the pericenter distance of the binary is set to be close to the tidal radius of the stellar binary . in sections  [ subsec : first ] and [ subsec : multi ] , we set the penetration parameter @xmath66 typically to be @xmath8620@xmath12250 and choose @xmath87 for demonstration only .",
    "the orientation of the orbit of the stellar binary , relative to that of the outer binary , @xmath88 $ ] , is assumed to be uniformly distributed in @xmath89 , if not specified .",
    "the initial orbital phases of both the stellar and outer binaries are randomly chosen in all the following calculations .",
    "as the stellar binaries are initially set on orbits weakly bound to the central mbh , binaries with large penetration parameters ( e.g. , @xmath90 ) may revolve around the central mbh for many ( e.g. , 10@xmath12100 or even @xmath91 ) orbits . in our calculations",
    "below , the period of the stellar binary is usually much smaller than that of the outer binary .",
    "therefore , most of the calculation time may be spent on integrating the stellar binary orbit when it is faraway from the mbh . however , when the binary star is faraway from the mbh , the tidal torque from the mbh on the binary star is rather weak , so we can approximate the motion of the stellar binary around the mbh into two independent two - body problems : one is for the stellar binary , and the other is for the outer binary on an elliptical orbit , both of which can be done analytically .",
    "we adopt the above two - body approximation when the tidal force from the mbh on the stellar binary is less than @xmath92 of the gravitational force between its two components ( we have checked the two - body approximation by setting a lower threshold , e.g. , @xmath93 or @xmath94 , and found no significant difference in our results ) . with this approximation , our calculation time",
    "is sped up substantially when @xmath57 is large ( @xmath95 ) and its accuracy can still be maintained .",
    "a star may be tidally disrupted if its close passage to the mbh is @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the mass and radius of the star , respectively .",
    "the radius of a star can be roughly given by @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 otherwise , where @xmath102 is the solar radius ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "due to the tidal disruption , part of the disrupted remnants may be swallowed by the central mbh and part may be ejected out . in our calculations",
    ", we terminate the evolution of the corresponding system once any component of the stellar binary approaches within a radius @xmath103 from the mbh .",
    "the tidal torque from the mbh may change the semimajor axis and the eccentricity of the stellar binary during its close passage to the mbh ( see further discussions in section  [ subsubsec : bound ] ) . in the three - body experiment",
    ", we assume that the two components of the binary star merge into a single star once the distance between the two components becomes smaller than the sum of their radii , and the evolution of the corresponding system is terminated once a merger event occurs .",
    "the consequences on the dynamical interactions of stellar binaries with the mbh can be different depending on whether the stellar binaries are initially on bound or unbound orbits .",
    "if the binary star is initially bound to the mbh , it may revolve around the central mbh for many orbits before its disruption or merger ; while the binary initially unbound to the mbh passes by the mbh only once even if it is not broken up during its close passage ( see further discussions in sections  [ subsec : first ] and [ subsec : multi ] ) .",
    "multiple times of interactions of bound binary stars with a central mbh have been discussed by @xcite , in which they focus on the post - newtonian effects on stellar orbits in the gravitational field of the mbh and mergers of the two components of the binary . in section  [ subsec : first ] , we analyze the consequence of the _ first _ close encounter of the stellar binary with the central mbh , and the changes in the orbital elements of the stellar binary ( if the binary star survives ) .",
    "then we consider the cumulative effects of multiple encounters in section  [ subsec : multi ] .",
    "we focus on discussing how the spatial and velocity distributions of hvss are connected with their originations , ejecting mechanisms , and dynamical environments in the gc .    in section  [ subsec :",
    "first ] , @xmath104 three - body experiments are performed for each of the four set of initial conditions , i.e. , @xmath83 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "if a stellar binary is not tidally broken up during its first close passage to the mbh , the three - body experiment ends up when the stellar binary reaches the apoapsis after its first close passage to the mbh . in section  [ subsec : multi ] , @xmath104 three - body experiments are performed for each set of initial conditions and those experiments that do not lead to disruption / merger / separation within @xmath108 revolutions are excluded .",
    "considering that binary stars are injected toward the mbh on weakly bound orbits with eccentricity close to 1 and @xmath109 , the changes in their orbits , as consequences of the tidal effect from the mbh , after their first close passages , can be characterized by the following five categories .    1 .",
    "the two components of the stellar binary remain bound to each other , but its orbital parameters ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) are changed by the tidal torque from the mbh during the close encounter .",
    "the outer binary is still bound and the stellar binary will encounter with the mbh again in its next close passage . the probability of our three - body experiments below resulted in this category is denoted by @xmath110 .",
    "the binary star is tidally broken up , with one component of the binary being ejected out as a high - velocity star , and the other one being trapped onto an orbit that is tightly bound to the mbh compared to its parent stellar binary .",
    "the probability resulted in this category is denoted by @xmath111 .",
    "the binary is tidally broken up into two single stars , and the two stars are not bound to each other but both bound to the central mbh .",
    "the probability resulted in this category is denoted by @xmath112 .",
    "4 .   the two components of the binary merge into one single star .",
    "the probability resulted in this category is denoted by @xmath113 .",
    "one ( or both ) component(s ) of the binary is ( are ) tidally disrupted and partly swallowed by the central mbh .",
    "the probability resulted in this category is denoted by @xmath114 .",
    "if a stellar binary can still maintain its integrity after its close passage to the central mbh , the eccentricity and the semi - major axis of the binary are generally changed due to the tidal torque from the mbh .",
    "* _ changes in eccentricities_. figure  [ fig : f3 ] shows the simulation results of the changes in eccentricities of the stellar binaries after their first close passages to the mbh . when the penetration parameter is small ( e.g. , @xmath115 ) , the eccentricity of the stellar binaries may be excited ( or de - excited ) to various values in the range from 0 to 1",
    ". the large range of the excited ( or de - excited ) eccentricities is mainly due to various phases of the stellar binaries at the close passages to the mbh and various orientations of the stellar binaries relative to the orbit of the outer binary . for encounters with @xmath116 , excitation ( or de - excitation ) on eccentricities is relatively small , especially for those binaries with @xmath83 .",
    "multiple subsequent encounters of the stellar binary with the mbh should be common at @xmath117 , where both @xmath111 and @xmath113 are small and @xmath110 is large ( see figure  [ fig : f5 ] ) . in these cases , the binary eccentricity ( and semimajor axis ) may then be further changed due to the cumulative effect of multiple subsequent encounters ( see section  [ subsec : multi ] ) .",
    "+    * _ changes in semimajor axes_. as shown in figure  [ fig : f4 ] , the semimajor axis of a binary star can be excited to a larger value but can also be de - excited to a smaller value .",
    "the changes of the semimajor axes depend on the orbital phases of the stellar binary during its close encounter .",
    "if the relative positional vector of the two components of the stellar binary is aligned with the radial vector from the central mbh , the stellar binary is more likely to be stretched and its semimajor axis is changed to a larger value after the encounter ; while the binary can also be shrunk and its semimajor axis may be changed to a smaller value if the relative positional vector of its two components is close to perpendicular to the radial vector .",
    "the time for the binary passing by the periapsis is comparable to , if not substantially smaller than , the orbital period of the stellar binary when the closest approach is roughly the tidal radius of the binary .",
    "therefore , whether the binary is stretched or shrunk is determined by the orbital phase and orientation of the stellar binary during its close encounter with the central mbh . as the stellar binary",
    "is stretched in most of its orbital phases , the semimajor axis of the binary is more likely to be excited rather than de - excited after its first close passage to the mbh ( see figure  [ fig : f4 ] ) .",
    "we also find that the relative change of the semimajor axis of the stellar binary is independent of the initial semimajor axis of the binary , which is verified by our calculations with adopting different @xmath62 .",
    "+    + in addition , we note here that the orbit of the outer binary star almost remains the same after the first close encounter if the stellar binary can maintain its integrity .",
    "our calculations above show that the semimajor axis of outer binaries may change by @xmath118 and the distance to the pericenter of the outer binary may only change by @xmath119 , which suggests that the location of the subsequent close encounters is almost the same as that of the first encounter if no other perturbation takes place on the orbit of the binary star .",
    "figure  [ fig : f5 ] shows our calculation results on the ejection probability @xmath111 and the merging probability @xmath113 .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : f5 ] , @xmath111 increases with decreasing penetration parameters @xmath66 because the tidal force from the mbh increases with decreasing @xmath66 .",
    "and @xmath111 also increases with increasing initial eccentricities of the stellar binaries .",
    "the reason is that the distance between the two components of a binary for given @xmath66 and @xmath52 , and hence the tidal torque on them , is larger if the binary has a larger eccentricity , and therefore the binary is easier to be broken up .",
    "for the same reasons , @xmath113 shown in figure  [ fig : f5 ] decreases with increasing @xmath66 at the large-@xmath66 end , but decreases with decreasing @xmath66 at the low-@xmath66 end due to the significant increase of @xmath111 .",
    "a stellar binary with a larger initial eccentricity is also easier to be excited to an eccentricity high enough for its two components to merge and thus @xmath113 increases with increasing @xmath120 at large-@xmath66 end .",
    "figure  [ fig : f6 ] shows the ejection velocity at infinity ( @xmath43 ) of the ejected component as a function of the penetration parameter ( @xmath66 ) of stellar binaries with different initial eccentricities ( @xmath83 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , respectively ) .",
    "we find that the rms values of the ejection velocities can be well fitted by the following formula : @xmath121 \\left(\\frac{a_{\\rm b , i}}{0.1\\au}\\right)^{-1/2 } \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left(\\frac{m_1+m_2}{6\\msun}\\right)^{1/3 } \\left(\\frac{m_{\\bullet}}{4\\times 10 ^ 6\\msun}\\right)^{1/6 } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the effective penetration parameter for a stellar binary with non - zero eccentricity , and @xmath124 is the normalization of the ejection velocity when @xmath83 and @xmath82 . for stellar binaries with zero initial eccentricities and any @xmath66 in the range of 20@xmath12150 ,",
    "this fitting formula gives a value similar to that given by equation ( 1 ) in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath64 is set to a smaller value , the ejection velocity may be changed by @xmath125 because the ejected star has to first overcome its initial bounding energy .",
    "if @xmath126 , for example , the ejection probability @xmath111 is significantly smaller than that shown in figure  [ fig : f5 ] and the ejection velocity @xmath19 is also substantially smaller because a significant fraction of the stellar binaries end up in consequence 3 instead of consequence 2 .            the tidal effect from the mbh may be not large enough to break up a stellar binary with a large @xmath66 ( e.g. , @xmath127 ) during the first close passage of the binary .",

    "the eccentricity of an outer binary ( or @xmath136 ) may increase ( or decrease ) slowly .",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrated that a secular instability of eccentric stellar disks rotating around the mbh can gradually excite some ( binary ) stars to extremely eccentric orbits ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "the time period for this secular evolution can be hundred to thousand times of the orbital period of the outer binary before the breakup or merging of the stellar binary .",
    "therefore , the probability for the stellar binary to be broken up is substantially even at a large @xmath66 due to the cumulative tidal effect from the mbh before the binary can possibly migrate into the region with a substantially small @xmath66 ( as also illustrated in figure  [ fig : f6 ] ) .",
    "note that the ejection velocity of the component escaping away from the mbh is substantially small if the binary is broken up at a large @xmath66 rather than at a small @xmath66 .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : f10 ] , most hvss are detected in galactocentric distances from @xmath49 to @xmath50 which is partly due to the detection limit and partly due to the limit in the survey area . in the mmt survey of hvss by @xcite ,",

    "figure  [ fig : f11 ] shows the @xmath10cdfs obtained from the `` rw-1 '' model . as seen from this figure , the observational @xmath10cdf for both hvs populations can be well reproduced if the hvss were originated from two disk - like stellar structures with orientations the same as the two best - fit planes and thickness of @xmath183 and @xmath159 , respectively ( also see the top panel of figure  [ fig : f12 ] ) . here",
    ", the thickness of a stellar disk is defined by the standard deviation of the inclination angle of stars in the disk from the disk central plane .",
    "for these two populations of the detected hvss , our k - s tests find the likelihoods of 0.896 and 0.999 that the observational @xmath10cdf are drawn from the same distribution as that obtained from the numerical simulations for the `` rw-1 '' model , respectively .",
    "all the other models ( i.e. , `` lp-1 '' , `` lp-2 '' , `` ub-1 '' , `` ub-2 '' , and `` rw-2 '' ) can reproduce the observational @xmath10cdfs for both hvs populations by choosing suitable thickness ( typically in the range of @xmath184@xmath12@xmath159 ) for the two disks .",
    "the resulted @xmath10cdfs are mainly determined by the thickness of the disks where the hvs progenitors are originated , and also weakly depend on the mechanism adopted that leads to the injection of stellar binaries into the immediate vicinity of the mbh .    alternatively , assuming that the stellar binaries , i.e. , the hvs progenitors , were isotropically distributed but with other initial settings the same as those in the above models , the ejected hvss should also be isotropically distributed in the survey area .",
    "we do similar numerical simulations and obtain the @xmath10cdfs for those isotropically distributed hvss , relative to the two best - fit thin disk planes of the detected hvss , as shown by the dashed curves in figure  [ fig : f11 ] . here , a simulated hvs is assigned to one of the two populations if it is closer to the best - fit plane of that population than to the other plane .",

    "therefore , we conclude that the detected hvss are highly unlikely to be produced from the tidal breakup of isotropically distributed progenitorial binary stars .",
    "this further strengthens the conclusion obtained in @xcite , i.e. , the detected hvss are probably originated from two thin disks with orientations similar to the cws disk and the northern arm of the minispiral ( or the warped outer part of the cws disk ) in the gc , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : f13 ] shows the @xmath14cdfs for both the simulated hvss ( obtained from different models ) and the observations .",
    "our numerical simulations show that the @xmath14cdf is almost independent of the thickness of the disk(s ) where the hvs progenitors are originated , but it does depend on how close the stellar binaries can approach the mbh and on the initial distribution of the semimajor axes of the stellar binaries .",
    "different models produce quite different @xmath14cdfs . in the `` lp '' models and",
    "the `` ub '' models , for example , more than 30% of the resulted hvss ( with @xmath187 ) have velocities larger than the maximum velocity of the detected hvss ( @xmath188 ) , while the `` rw '' models can produce a steep @xmath14cdf which is quite similar to the observational ones .",
    "the models with log - normal distributions of @xmath62 produce less hvss at the high - velocity end because of the fraction of stellar binaries with small @xmath62 ( i.e. , @xmath189 ) is substantially smaller compared with that in those models with the pik law . for the first hvs population , our k - s tests find @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) and @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) likelihoods that the @xmath14cdfs obtained from the `` lp-1 '' ( `` ub-1 '' ) model and the `` lp-2 '' ( `` ub-2 '' ) model are drawn from the same distribution as the observational ones , respectively , which suggests that the first hvs population is unlikely to be produced by either of the `` lp '' model and the `` ub '' model .",
    "for the second hvs population , the k - s likelihood is @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) and @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) for the `` lp-1 '' ( `` ub-1 '' ) model and the `` lp-2 '' ( `` ub-2 '' ) model , respectively .",
    "these numbers suggest that the second population is not likely to be produced by the `` lp '' or `` ub '' models with an initial @xmath62 distribution of @xmath198 but it may not be inconsistent with the `` lp '' ( or `` ub '' ) models with a log - normal distribution of @xmath62 ( though with limited statistics ) .",
    "however , the @xmath14cdfs resulted from the `` rw '' models appear to be consistent with the observations as the k - s tests find the likelihoods of 0.52 ( 0.13 ) and 0.43 ( 0.52 ) that the observational @xmath14cdfs of the first ( second ) hvs population are the same as that obtained from the `` rw-1 '' model and the `` rw-2 '' model , respectively .",
    "adopting a different form of the galactic potential may affect the estimation of the @xmath14cdf for the detected hvss in section 2 and the selection effects discussed in section 4.1 .",
    "for example , if adopting a simple galactic potential model as that described by equation ( 8) in @xcite , the @xmath19 of the detected hvss ranges from @xmath45 to @xmath46 and the slope of the @xmath14cdf is slightly flatter than that estimated in section 2 .",
    "the simulated @xmath14cdfs from the models of `` lp-1 '' , `` lp-2 '' , `` ub-1 '' , and `` ub-2 '' are not likely to be consistent with the @xmath14cdf of the detected hvss , while both the `` rw-1 '' model and the `` rw-2 '' model can produce a @xmath14cdf similar to that estimated for the detected hvss according to the new galactic potential .",
    "our main conclusion that the tbk mechanism can reproduce the detected @xmath14cdf made in this section is not affected by the choice of the galactic potential ( also see discussion in @xcite and @xcite ) .    to close this section , we note here that the fraction of stellar binaries resulting in ejection of hvss with properties similar to the detected ones is around @xmath199@xmath12@xmath200 in those models adopted above ( see table  [ tab : tab2 ] ) .",
    "current observations imply that the total number of hvss similar to the detected ones is @xmath201 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the number of stellar binaries is required to be around a few thousands and the injecting rate is @xmath202 .",
    "this rate appears to be roughly consistent with that estimated by @xcite if the progenitors are injected into the immediate vicinity of the mbh due to secular instability developed in the stellar disk .",
    "however , we caution here that the dynamics leading to the injection of ( binary ) stars is currently not clear , and therefore any argument based on the event rate may have substantial limitation in distinguishing the production mechanism of the detected hvss .",
    "the dynamical interactions between a bbh and single stars can also eject hvss ( the bbh mechanism ) . in section  [ subsec : paraspace ] , we discuss possible constraints on the possible parameter space of a bbh if it exists ( or existed ) in the gc and is responsible for the ejection of the detected hvss . according to those constraints , in sections  [ subsec : paraspace][subsec : bbhvcdf ] , we perform a large number of monte carlo simulations for a few models of the decay of the bbh orbit to investigate whether the spatial and velocity distributions of the detected hvss are compatible with the bbh mechanism .      the parameter space for the secondary bh , if being currently located close to the central primary mbh , has been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "if a bbh is responsible for ejecting the detected hvss , simple constraints on the bbh parameter space may be directly obtained by the properties of the hvss as follows ( see figure  [ fig : f14 ] ) .    * the travel time of the detected hvss ranges from @xmath207 to @xmath51  myr so that the bbh should exist in the gc @xmath51  myr ago and should not have merged into a single bh @xmath207  myr ago , which put a stringent constraint on the location of the hypothetical bbh in the gc .",

    "note that the above constraint on @xmath211 is obtained by assuming that the initial eccentricity of the bbh is @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) and the bbh orbital decay is dominated by the energy loss due to gravitational wave radiation ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "adopting a moderately large initial bbh eccentricity does not change the constraint much ( e.g. , @xmath214 is increased only by a factor of 2.5 if @xmath215 ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the interactions between the bbh and the stars injected from the stellar disk ( e.g. , the cws disk ) may be insignificant to the bbh orbital decay as the number of those stars injected into the vicinity of the bbh is relatively small compared with that from other bound stars .",

    "if the progenitors of the detected hvss were originated from the stellar disk surrounding the mbh and the hvss are ejected out by the bbh mechanism , the bbh ( with a given mass ratio ) should be hard enough to efficiently eject such high - velocity stars . + the rms velocity of the ejected hvss at infinity , if their progenitors are on parabolic ( or hyperbolic ) orbits with eccentricities close to 1 , can be given by @xcite @xmath219 therefore we should have a rough constraint on the bbh semimajor axis when the bbh began to eject those detected hvss , i.e. , @xmath220 , as the minimum velocity of these hvss at infinity is @xmath221 ( the solid line in figure  [ fig : f14 ] ) .",
    "considering that hvss can be ejected by the bbh with a larger semimajor axis , we reset @xmath222 which corresponds to an rms ejection velocity of @xmath223 and is substantially smaller than the value at which the bbh becomes `` hard '' @xcite .      the orbital evolution of a bbh during its hard stage is dominated by three - body interactions of low - angular momentum stars with the bbh . as shown in @xcite , the decay timescale for the hypothetical bbh in the gc is roughly 48  gyr during the hard stage unless the potential of the galactic bulge is significantly flattened or triaxial @xcite or there are a large number of massive perturbers @xcite which lead to efficient transferring of stars onto low - angular momentum orbits .",
    "this decay timescale is substantially longer than the travel time of the detected hvss ( @xmath224  myr ) .",

    "as seen from figure  [ fig : f12 ] , a number of hvss resulted from the bbh mechanism can have substantially large inclination angles relative to their original planes ; while no such hvss appears in the tbk mechanism .",
    "the reason for this difference is that there always exist some hvs progenitors which can interact with the secondary bh at a very small separation and receive a relatively large kick .",
    "these very close interactions lead to the large inclination angles of some simulated hvss",

    "the deviation of the simulated hvss from the central plane of the disk(s ) ( with a given thickness ) is larger if the mass ratio of the bbh is larger ( see the analysis in @xcite ) .",

    "similarly , a different choice of the orientation of the disk plane relative to the orbital plane of the bbh may also result in slightly different @xmath10cdf , but which can also be compensated by different choices of the thickness of the disk(s ) .",

    "the simulated @xmath14cdf is insensitive to the choice of the orientation of the disk relative to the bbh orbital plane .",
    "the simulated @xmath14cdf is also insensitive to the choice of the mass ratio @xmath243 ( if @xmath244@xmath12@xmath245 ) and the eccentricity of the bbh ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : f16 ] , different models produce quite similar @xmath14cdfs and too many hvss with ejection velocities substantially higher than those of the detected hvss .",
    "the primary reason for these similarly flat @xmath14cdfs is as follows .",
    "the hvs progenitors injected into the region with penetration parameter @xmath246 can gain some energy during the dynamical interaction with the bbh , and the mean energy gain is mainly determined by the semimajor axis and the mass ratio of the bbh @xcite but insensitive to the detailed values of @xmath247 . with increasing @xmath247 to be slightly larger than 1 ,",
    "the energy gain dramatically drops to 0 ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the slope of the @xmath14cdf is largely determined by the scatters of the energy gains around their rms value at @xmath246 , and the scatters are mainly due to the different orbital phases of the bbh and insensitive to other bbh parameters . because of these features in the bbh mechanism , even the `` rw '' model for injecting stars , which suppresses the ejection of hvss at the high - velocity end for the tbk mechanism , does not lead to such a suppression for the bbh mechanism here .    with the relevant parameters for the models listed in table  [ tab : tab3 ] , the simulated @xmath14cdfs are all quite flat ( except for the `` fix - ub '' model ) , compared with the observational ones .",
    "for the first hvs population , our k - s tests find that the likelihoods for the simulated @xmath14cdfs to be consistent with the observed distribution are @xmath194 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath250 , and @xmath194 for the `` fix '' , `` fix - ub '' , `` gw1 '' , `` gw2 '' , `` gw3 '' , and `` expd '' models , respectively . except the high likelihood for the `` fix - ub '' model",

    "the k - s likelihoods are @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath195 , @xmath253 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 for the `` fix '' , `` fix - ub '' , `` gw1 '' , `` gw2 '' , `` gw3 '' , and `` expd '' models , respectively .",
    "those likelihoods are not small enough so that the @xmath14cdf for the second hvs population does not appear to be inconsistent with those obtained from the those models , especially for the `` fix - ub '' model . for the combined sample of both the first and the second hvs populations , the ks likelihoods are @xmath251 , @xmath255 , @xmath249 , @xmath256 , @xmath256 , and @xmath253 , respectively",
    ".    for the models in which @xmath240 evolves with time ( i.e. , the `` gw '' and `` expd '' models ) , our simulations indicate a weak dependence of the ejection velocity on time , as the bbh semimajor axis is smaller at a later time and the corresponding ejection velocity is larger ( see equation ( 9 ) ) . compared to our results , the simulated @xmath14cdf obtained by @xcite is flatter , as in their model the bbh decays fast at large separations and more stars with higher velocities are ejected at a later time as the bbh becomes harder . due to the limited statistics of the detected hvss and the uncertainties in the bbh dynamical evolution model",
    ", it appears to be premature to use the @xmath14cdf to distinguish whether the hvss are ejected due to the tbk mechanism or the bbh mechanism and also constrain detailed dynamical models for injecting stars to the mbh(s ) vicinity .",
    "note that the ejected stars are actually moving in the galactic potential , some of those with low velocities ( e.g. , @xmath257 ) may return to the vicinity of the bbh and receive further kicks , which may change the final @xmath14cdf .",
    "we check this effect by doing additional three - body experiments for the ejected stars with low ejection velocities .",
    "we find that the obtained final @xmath14cdfs are only slightly flatter than those shown in figure  [ fig : f16 ] and our conclusions above will not be significantly affected .",
    "in this paper , we first use three - body experiments to study the interactions of the mbh with binary stars bound to the mbh . we find that the probability of ejecting hvss is substantially enhanced due to multiple encounters between the mbh and the stellar binaries injecting into its vicinity even at a distance substantially larger than the tidal breakup radius . given a penetration parameter ( e.g. , @xmath127 ) , the velocities of the hvss ejected after multiple encounters are substantially smaller than those ejected by first encounters because of the excitations of their semimajor axes and eccentricities .    assuming that the progenitors of the detected hvss are originated from stellar disk structures , by using monte carlo simulations we find the distribution of the inclination of hvss relative to the disk planes can be well reproduced by both the mechanism of tidal breakup of binary stars and the mechanism of ejecting hvss by a hypothetical bbh in the gc .",
    "however , an isotropical origination of hvs progenitors is inconsistent with the observed inclination distributions .",
    "we find that the spatial distribution of hvss is primarily determined by the geometrical structure(s ) that their progenitors originated but less sensitive to whether the ejection is due to tidal breakup of binary stars in the vicinity of the central mbh or dynamical interactions of stars with a bbh .",
    "these results strengthen the conclusion in @xcite that the detected hvss are probably originated from the two disk - like stellar structures in the gc , one of which is probably the cws disk .",
    "we find that the hvs velocity distribution should encode some dynamical information in the gc environment .",
    "assuming that the detected hvss were ejected out from the gc by tidal breakup of binary stars , its velocity distribution can be reproduced if the hvs progenitors diffuse onto low angular momentum orbits slowly and most of the progenitorial binaries were broken up at large distances with small ejection velocities . in this scenario , the hvs velocity distribution not only depends on the distribution of the initial semimajor axes of the stellar binaries but also on how the binary stars diffuse onto low angular momentum orbits to reach the vicinity of the central mbh . if the progenitors were injected to the vicinity of the mbh by large perturbations on their orbital angular momenta , the simulated hvs velocity distributions appear to be flatter at the high - velocity end , which are inconsistent with the observed ones .",
    "if the hvss were ejected out by a bbh in the gc , our simulations show that the hvs velocity distribution is not sensitive to the mass ratio and other properties of the bbh but may depend on how the bbh orbit decays ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "we find that it is less likely that the observed hvs velocity distribution can be reproduced with the allowed parameter space of the bbh , as the bbh mechanism produces a relatively flat spectrum at the high - velocity end ; however , the bbh mechanism can not be statistically ruled out , yet .",
    "future deep surveys of hvss and better statistics of the hvs spatial and velocity distributions should enable to distinguish the ejection mechanisms of hvss and shed new light on the dynamical environment surrounding the central mbh .",
    "so far , most of the detected hvss are b - type stars , and their progenitors are associated to some specific stellar structures , such as the cws disk in the gc .",
    "however , there are many late - type stars in the stellar cusp of the gc and injection of these late - type ( binary ) stars into the vicinity of central mbh ( or bbh ) should result in an old population of hvss in the galactic halo .",
    "the spatial distribution of the old population of hvss should be more isotropic as the parent population of their progenitors is dynamically relaxed .",
    "the velocity distribution of this old - population hvss could also be quite different , as their progenitors may have a different dynamical environment and are injected into the vicinity of the central mbh differently .",
    "searching for the old population of hvss @xcite should be helpful in revealing the dynamical environment in the gc .    * note added in proof : * the unbound hvs , he 0437 - 5439 , was proposed to be ejected out from the lmc ( edelmann et al . 2005 ) ; and this object was excluded in the original fits to the two disk planes in lu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . however , a recent measurement of its proper motion by the hst suggests it should be originated from the gc ( brown et al .",
    "as seen from figure 12 , the deviation of he 0437 - 5439 away from the disk plane(s ) is relatively large compared with other hvss , and it is difficult to have its progenitor originated from the best fit disk(s ) under the tbk mechanism .",
    "however , the deviation can be compatible with the disk origin under the bbh mechanism in which a small fraction of hvss with large scatters can be produced ( see discussion in section 5.3 ) .",
    "because of the short lifetime and long traveling time of he 0437 - 5439 , it is suggested that this object was originally a binary star when being ejected out from the gc and lately merged into a single blue straggler ( brown et al .",
    "2010 , perets 2009b ) .",
