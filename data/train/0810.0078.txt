    "hawking s semiclassical analysis of the black hole radiation suggests that most information about initial states is shielded behind the event horizon and will not back to the asymptotic region far from the evaporating black hole  @xcite .",
    "this means that the unitarity is violated by an evaporating black hole .",
    "however , this conclusion has been debated by many authors for three decades  @xcite .",
    "it is closely related to a long standing puzzle of the information loss paradox , which states the question of whether the formation and subsequent evaporation of a black hole is unitary .",
    "one of the most urgent problems in black hole physics is to resolve the unitarity issue . in this direction ,",
    "a complete description of black hole evaporation is an important issue . in order to determine the final state of evaporation process ,",
    "a more precise treatment including quantum gravity effects and backreaction is generally required . at present ,",
    "two leading candidates for quantum gravity are the string theory and the loop quantum gravity .",
    "interestingly , the semiclassical analysis of the loop quantum black hole provides a regular black hole ( rbh ) without singularity whose minimum size @xmath0 is at planck scale @xmath1 , in contrast to the classical one  @xcite .",
    "rbhs have been considered , dating back to bardeen  @xcite , for avoiding the curvature singularity beyond the event horizon in black hole physics  @xcite .",
    "their causal structures are similar to the reissner - nordstrm black hole with the singularity replaced by de sitter space - time with curvature radius @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "hayward has discussed the formation and evaporation process of a rbh with minimum size @xmath3  @xcite which can be identified with the minimal length induced from the string theory  @xcite , and its thermodynamic analysis was performed in  @xcite .",
    "a rigorous treatment of the evaporation process was carried out for the renormalization group ( rg ) improved black hole with minimum size @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the noncommutativity with parameter @xmath5 may provide another rbh with minimum scale @xmath6 : noncommutative black hole  @xcite and its commutative limit is the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "recently , the authors  @xcite have investigated thermodynamics and evaporation process of this noncommutative black hole .",
    "the thermodynamics similarity between the noncommutative and reissner - nordstrm black holes was shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "the entropy issue of this black hole was discussed in  @xcite and the hawking radiation was considered in  @xcite .",
    "the connection between their minimum sizes is given by @xmath7 .",
    "in this work , we construct a new black hole in ads@xmath8 spacetimes by introducing an anisotropic perfect fluid inspired by the 4d noncommutative black hole .",
    "this is a regular black hole with two horizons in three dimensions .",
    "we compare thermodynamics of this black hole with that of non - rotating btz black hole ( nbtz ) .",
    "the first - law of thermodynamics is not compatible with the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "finally , we discuss thermodynamics of 3d noncommutative black holes based on the gaussian distribution .",
    "we start with a cylindrically symmetric line element in three dimensions @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the metric function to be determined .    it has been shown  @xcite that the noncommutativity eliminates point - like structures in favor of smeared objects in flat spacetime .",
    "a way of implementing the effect of smearing is a substitution rule : in four - dimensional ( 4d ) spacetimes , dirac - delta function @xmath11 is replaced by a gaussian distribution of the minimal width @xmath6  @xcite as @xmath12 whose mass distribution is defined by @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the lower incomplete gamma function defined as defined by @xmath15 in the limit of @xmath16 , one finds @xmath17 .    in three dimensions ,",
    "dirac - delta function @xmath18 is replaced by a gaussian distribution of the minimal width @xmath6 as @xmath19 whose mass distribution is simply calculated to be @xmath20 in the limit of @xmath16 , one recovers @xmath21 easily .    the gaussian distribution ( [ 3dgd ] ) may be suitable for describing a three - dimensional ( 3d ) noncommutative black hole",
    ". however , we will show in sec .",
    "vi that this choice makes an difficulty to define a small black hole .",
    "it turns out that the 3d noncommutative black hole does not have two horizons and it takes a degenerate horizon at the origin @xmath22 .",
    "however , the small 3d noncommutative black hole is not defined in the limit of @xmath23 because a smeared ( gaussian ) distribution around the origin is not appropriate to make a small black hole .    on the other hand , the 4d noncommutative black hole has two horizons and thus it becomes an extremal black hole for @xmath24 .",
    "as far as concerned on the study of thermodynamics of black holes , the relevant region to observer at infinity is outside the degenerate horizon .",
    "hence it is promising to obtain a 3d black hole with two horizons .",
    "for this purpose , we wish to look for a different mass distribution which may offer @xmath25 in eq.([4dmd ] ) .    to this end",
    ", we compare the 4d poisson equation of @xmath26 with 3d equation @xmath27 . considering the relation of @xmath28 , a quantity of @xmath29 is a similar object in 3d spacetimes .",
    "hence , we introduce a new mass density of cylindrically symmetric , smeared gravitational source as @xmath30 whose mass distribution mimics the 4d mass distribution @xmath31 as @xmath32 we note that this mass distribution differs from the @xmath33 in eq.([3dmd ] ) for the 3d noncommutative black hole .",
    "this choice is meaningful for a 3d smeared gravitational source because it provides a regular black hole with two horizons . for another 3d noncommutative btz black hole ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .    in order to find a black hole solution in ads@xmath8 spacetime",
