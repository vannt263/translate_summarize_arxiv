    "majorana fermions @xcite , particles identified with their own antiparticles , have recently received a considerable attention in condensed matter physics after the seminal kitaev s proposal @xcite of a spinless chain model which could be realized using a topological superconducting state especially in mesoscopic setups @xcite .",
    "in particular , topological insulators @xcite in combination with @xmath3-wave superconductors are natural candidates for a practical implementation @xcite of the kitaev s model because the edge states in topological insulators provide a single pair of the fermi points .",
    "another practical implementation @xcite of the kitaev s model is based on spin - orbit coupled one - dimensional quantum wires placed in an external magnetic field freezing out one spin component . when this effectively `` spinless '' system is proximity coupled to an @xmath3-wave superconductor , the one - dimensional wire becomes a topological superconductor implementing the kitaev s model .",
    "as soon as the the majorana bound states are created there appears the question how to experimentally detect them .",
    "since these are zero energy modes of a mesoscopic system , it is natural to try to detect them by applying a bias voltage to this mesoscopic system and measuring the current flowing through it .",
    "the differential conductance then should have a maximum at zero bias .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite and signatures of the presence of the majorana fermions in the system have been reported .",
    "schematic picture of the setup .",
    "the quantum dot here represents a non - interacting system with a discrete energy spectrum .",
    "it is coupled via tunneling junctions to left and right normal metallic contacts ( in general the number of normal contacts may be arbitrary ) whose energy spectra are continuum .",
    "the strength of this tunneling coupling is characterized by the energies @xmath4 ( see the text for the details ) . besides",
    ", the quantum dot is coupled to a topological superconductor whose ends support two majorana bound states described by the second quantized operators @xmath5 .",
    "this tunneling coupling is realized via only one majorana mode @xmath6 and is characterized by the energy @xmath7 ( see the text for the details).,width=8 ]    an alternative possibility to detect majorana fermions is to couple the system supporting majorana bound states to a normal system via tunneling .",
    "the majorana fermions are then entangled with normal fermions changing drastically the behavior of the initially normal system .",
    "this approach was used in ref .",
    "@xcite where the normal system was a non - interacting quantum dot as well as in refs .",
    "@xcite where the normal system was a quantum dot with interactions . in both interacting and non - interacting cases",
    "the emphasis was made on the transport properties of the quantum dots coupled to topological superconductors .",
    "the differential conductance was calculated and the zero bias majorana peak was found . in the interacting case",
    "an interplay between the majorana and kondo physics was investigated calculating in addition to the current also the shot noise which is the current - current correlation .",
    "below we adhere to that alternative strategy but instead of the transport properties of a system coupled to a topological superconductor ( or to several topological superconductors ) we focus on the thermodynamics of this system and calculate its entropy @xmath1 and specific heat @xmath2 .",
    "we demonstrate that 1 ) @xmath1 as a function of the temperature has a plateau shape with integer values of @xmath0 on these plateaus in the absence of the topological superconductor or when the two majorana modes within each topological superconductor strongly overlap but 2 ) acquires additional plateaus with non - integer values of @xmath0 when only one majorana mode from each topological superconductor is entangled via tunneling mechanisms with the normal fermions in the quantum dot .",
    "these additional plateaus excite in the temperature dependence of @xmath2 3 ) additional majorana peaks being its first low temperature peaks .",
    "crucially , as it will become obvious from the text below , this alternative approach is very attractive from the point of view of experimental thermodynamic signatures of majorana fermions because the quantum dot can be viewed just as a model of a low energy spectrum of an arbitrary finite ( discrete energy spectrum ) macroscopic system coupled via tunneling mechanisms to topological superconductors .",
    "therefore , our results are quite general and simple to detect in modern experiments .",
    "this is in contrast to setups @xcite where the majorana thermodynamics requires specific kondo spin - flip correlations with the hamiltonian parameters fine tuned which is difficult to implement in real experiments as well as in contrast to setups with more ingredients such as the josephson vortex dynamics @xcite which complicates the experimental observation of the majorana physics and in contrast to setups with only continuum spectra @xcite where the entropy as a function of the temperature does not have a plateau shape and , therefore , it is impossible in a realistic experiment ( always performed at finite temperatures ) to disentangle the majorana and normal fermions contributions to the entropy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mt ]",
    "we discuss a setup with majorana tunneling processes involved and calculate its entropy .",
    "the thermodynamic results are presented and analyzed in section [ rd ] . with section [ concl ]",
    "we conclude the paper .",

    "therefore , its hamiltonian has the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a single - particle index .",
    "the quantum dot is coupled to a number ( two in the figure but can be arbitrary ) of normal metallic contacts with continuum spectra via normal tunneling @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the set of quantum numbers characterizing the contact with the number @xmath12 .",
    "the contacts are assumed to be non - interacting , @xmath13 .",

    "<S> in thermodynamics a macroscopic state of a system results from a number of its microscopic states . this number is given by the exponent of the system s entropy @xmath0 . in non - interacting systems with discrete energy spectra , such as large scale quantum dots , @xmath1 as a function of the temperature has usually a plateau shape with integer values of @xmath0 on these plateaus . </S>",
    "<S> plateaus with non - integer values of @xmath0 are fundamentally forbidden and would be thermodynamically infeasible . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the entropy of a non - interacting quantum dot coupled via tunneling to normal metals with continuum spectra as well as to topological superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the entropy may have non - integer plateaus if the topological superconductors support weakly overlapping majorana bound states . </S>",
    "<S> this brings a fundamental change in the thermodynamics of the quantum dot whose specific heat @xmath2 acquires low temperature majorana peaks which should be absent according to the conventional thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a fundamental thermodynamic understanding of the transport properties , such as the linear conductance . in general our results show that the thermodynamics of systems coupled to majorana modes represents a fundamental physical interest with diverse applications depending on versatility of possible coupling mechanisms . </S>"
