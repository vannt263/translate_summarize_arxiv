    "the example at stake is a lagrangian submanifold @xmath47 of @xmath0 which arises as an orbit for an @xmath48-action , similar to a lagrangian studied by river chiang in  @xcite .",
    "we first define @xmath47 explicitly as a subset of @xmath0 : @xmath49 \\ ; \\mid \\ ; \\alpha , \\beta \\in \\mathbb{c } \\ ,     |\\alpha|^2+|\\beta|^2=1 \\right\\ } \\ .\\ ] ]    the set @xmath47 is a submanifold of @xmath0 diffeomorphic to @xmath1 .",

    "it is interesting also to discuss the image of @xmath47 by the full toric moment map @xmath101 .",
    "this image satisfies the equation @xmath102 because @xmath103 holds at all points in @xmath47 .",

    "these coordinates the fubini - study form is @xmath112 . in these terms",
    "the discussion above shows that the tangent space at any point @xmath113 $ ] of @xmath47 with all @xmath114 contains the tangent vector @xmath115 and is contained in the coisotropic subspace space spanned by @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 ( this subspace is the kernel of @xmath119 ) .",
    "so a generating system of @xmath120 may be chosen to be @xmath121 and @xmath122 of the form @xmath123 for some real functions @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( we used the transversality fact `` @xmath126 on @xmath47 in the interior of the moment polytope '' ; see the proof of lemma  [ lemma_tranversality ] ) .    by shuffling the coordinates",
    "there are other two similar lagrangian submanifolds whose images under the toric moment map are the other two medians ( line segments joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposing side ) .",
    "+ if we consider lagrangians in @xmath0 whose image by the toric moment map is the intersection of the moment polytope with an affine space , there are also the trivial examples given by :    * interior points ( the lagrangians are the action tori ) , * line segments _ not through the vertices _ and with specific rational slopes ( the lagrangians are the preimages by single - circle reduction of an @xmath127 in @xmath2 , which topologically are tori ) and * the full polytope ( the lagrangians are the standard @xmath1 and its toric rotations ) .",

    "there he analysed @xmath47 as a singular fibration over the moment map image tilted segment , within the 2-torus fibers , using our earlier lemmas .",
    "+ the result in lemma  [ once ] is interesting in itself since it shows a contrast between the lagrangian @xmath47 and the standard embedding of @xmath1 in @xmath0 as the fixed locus of complex conjugation : the standard embedding intersects each orbit of the second circle action twice ( in the interior of the moment polytope ) , namely for each point @xmath144 $ ] with @xmath145 there is also the point @xmath146 $ ] related by the second circle action .",
    "similarly for the first circle action .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath47 has also double intersections with orbits of the first circle action : @xmath147 $ ] and @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "the previous two lemmas show that @xmath47 is a one - to - one transverse lifting of a compact lagrangian submanifold @xmath32 in @xmath2 . in order to see that @xmath32 is a great circle it is enough to note that it lies in the middle level set of @xmath149 .",

    "these properties all follow directly from the fact that @xmath47 is hamiltonian isotopic to the standard @xmath1 according to theorem  6.9 of li and wu  @xcite . having chosen the level @xmath153",
