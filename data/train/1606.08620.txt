    "modern measurements of the bound - electron @xmath0-factor in h - like ions have reached the level of fractional accuracy of @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "it shall be possible to conduct similar experiments not only with a single ion in the trap , but also with several ions simultaneously .",
    "such a setup would allow one to directly access differences of the @xmath0-factors of different ions , thus largely reducing systematic uncertainties and possibly gaining about two orders of magnitude in experimental accuracy  @xcite .",
    "so , experimental investigations of differences of the bound - electron @xmath0 factors on a sub-@xmath3 level look feasible in the future . such measurements would become sensitive to the uncertainty of the fine - structure constant @xmath4 , which is presently known up to the fractional accuracy of @xmath5 @xcite",
    ". it might be tempting to use such future experiments as a tool for an independent determination of @xmath4 .    in order to accomplish a competitive determination of @xmath4 from the bound - electron @xmath0-factor experiments , one has to complete theoretical calculations to a matching accuracy , which is a challenging task .",

    "@xcite , a weighted difference of the @xmath0-factors of b - like and h - like charge states of the same element was proposed .",
    "it was shown that the theoretical uncertainty of the nuclear size effect for ions around pb can be reduced to @xmath7 , which was several times smaller than the uncertainty due to the fine - structure constant at the time of publication of ref .  @xcite . since then , however , the uncertainty of @xmath4 was decreased by an order of magnitude @xcite , thus making it more difficult to access it in the bound - electron @xmath0-factor experiments . in our recent letter",
    "@xcite we proposed a weighted difference of the @xmath0-factors of low-@xmath6 li - like and h - like ions , for which a more significant cancellation of nuclear effects can be achieved . in the present paper",

    "( [ eq42 ] ) within its current error bars of @xmath118 @xcite , the corresponding error of @xmath113 can be obtained .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : sens ] shows this comparison for the @xmath0-factor of the ground state of li - like ions @xmath11 , whereas the middle panel gives the same comparison for the @xmath8-weighted difference @xmath113 .",

    "[ fig : sens ] we can conclude that up to @xmath120 , the weighted difference @xmath113 yields possibilities for an improved determination of @xmath4 .",
    "the determination of @xmath4 from @xmath113 has two drawbacks .",
    "the first one is the cancellation of @xmath4 dependence of @xmath113 around @xmath119 , leading to a loss of sensitivity to @xmath4 in this @xmath6 region .",
    "the second one is that @xmath113 contains the same free - qed part which is used for the determination of @xmath4 from the free - electron @xmath0 factor , which means that these two determinations can not be regarded as fully independent .",
    "both drawbacks can be avoided by introducing another difference , @xmath121)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath122 being the weighted difference ( [ eq : xi ] ) for the nuclear charge @xmath6 , and @xmath123)$ ] is the corresponding difference for the nuclear charge @xmath124 $ ] , where @xmath125 $ ] stands for the upper or the lower integer part . in the difference @xmath126 , most free - qed contributions vanish .",
    "so , by a small sacrifice of the sensitivity of the binding effects to @xmath4 , we removed the dip around @xmath119 and made the theory of the weighted difference ( almost ) independent on the theory of the free - electron @xmath0-factor .",
    "the right panel of fig  [ fig : sens ] presents the comparison of the uncertainty due to @xmath4 with the error of the fns effect for the weighted difference @xmath126 .",
    "one finds a smooth dependence of the sensitivity to @xmath4 on @xmath6 , without any dip in the region around @xmath119 .",
    "we observe that in the region @xmath127 , the weighted difference @xmath126 offers better possibilities for determining @xmath4 than @xmath113 .",
    "employing the difference @xmath126 can be also advantageous from the experimental point of view .",

    "we thus observe that @xmath126 can be effectively determined in an experiment by measuring two equal - weight @xmath0-factor differences ( namely , the ones in the first and second rows of the above equation ) and @xmath130 . the equal - weight differences may be measured with largely suppressed systematic errors and thus can be determined in near - future experiments much more accurately than the @xmath0-factors of individual ions .",

    "( [ eq : omega - rewritten ] ) is suppressed by a small factor of @xmath131 \\approx 0.02 - 0.04 $ ] in the region of interest .",
    "therefore , the experimental error of @xmath126 can be significantly improved as compared to that of the absolute @xmath0-factors .",

    "the total theoretical value is compared to the experimental result @xcite .",
    "the errors of the dirac value and of the one - loop free qed ( @xmath133 ) result specified in the table are due to the uncertainty of the current value of @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the fns effect specified in the table is @xmath135 , which is already smaller than the uncertainty of the dirac value due to @xmath4 .",
    "the fns uncertainty is of purely numerical origin , i.e. it does not influenced by the errors due to the rms charge radius and the nuclear charge distribution , and thus it can be further improved in future calculations .",
    "table  [ tab : si ] illustrates another advantage of the @xmath8-weighted difference : the contributions of one - electron binding qed effects to @xmath113 are much smaller than those to @xmath11 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that these effects largely originate from short distances , similarly to the fns effect , and thus are significantly canceled in the difference . in particular , the uncertainty of @xmath136 due to three - loop binding qed effects is on the @xmath3 level , implying that these effects do not need to be known to a high degree of accuracy for the determination of @xmath4 .",
    "table  [ tab : si ] shows that the present experimental and theoretical precision of @xmath137 is on the level of few parts in @xmath138 , which is significantly worse than the precision achieved for other systems ( in particular , h - like carbon , where the present experimental and theoretical uncertainties are , correspondingly , @xmath139 and @xmath140 @xcite ) .",
    "this underperformance is , however , more due to a lack of motivation than due to principal obstacles .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the same precision as for h - like carbon can be also obtained for @xmath141 , with an existing ion trap @xcite .",
    "further experimental advance is anticipated that could bring one or two orders of magnitude of improvement @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , the modern nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics ( nrqed ) approach ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) can apparently provide a theoretical result for li - like carbon with the same accuracy as obtained for its h - like counterpart @xcite . moreover , further theoretical advance is possible : the two - loop qed corrections of order @xmath142 and the three - loop qed corrections of order @xmath143 can be calculated , both for h - like and li - like ions @xcite .    as we are presently interested in light ions , the best way for the advancement of theory would be a combination of two complementary methods .",
    "the first one is the nrqed method ( used , e.g. , in @xcite ) that accounts for the nonrelativistic electron - electron interactions to all orders in @xmath9 , but expands the qed and relativistic effects in powers of @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "the second approach ( used , e.g. , in @xcite ) accounts for the relativistic effects to all orders in @xmath1 but employs perturbation expansions in @xmath4 ( qed effects ) and in @xmath9 ( electron - electron interaction ) .",
    "matching the coefficients of the @xmath1 and @xmath9 expansions from the two methods allows one to combine them together , as it was done for energy levels in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result of this procedure",
    ", only higher - order corrections in @xmath1 will be expanded in @xmath9 and only higher - order corrections in @xmath9 will be expanded in @xmath1 .",
    "this approach should allow one to advance theory to the level required for a determination of @xmath4 .",
    "the principal limitation for the theory is set by the non - trivial nuclear structural effects , such as the nuclear deformation , nuclear polarization , etc . for light ions ,",
    "the leading nuclear effects are described by effective operators proportional to the dirac delta function @xmath144 .",
    "such effects are canceled in the weighted difference @xmath113 .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainty due to the remaining nuclear effects in @xmath113 should be of the same order as the nuclear - model dependence error of the fns effect . from the breakdown in table  [ tab:1 ]",
    "we deduce that for silicon , this error is by about two orders of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty due to @xmath4 . we thus conclude that the nuclear effects do not represent any obstacles for the determination of @xmath4 from @xmath113 and @xmath126 .",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that , for moderately light elements , such weighted difference is nearly free from uncertainties associated with nuclear effects and can be utilized to extract the fine - structure constant from bound - electron @xmath0-factor experiments with an accuracy competitive with or better than its current literature value . </S>"
