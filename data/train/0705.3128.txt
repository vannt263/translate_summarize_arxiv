    "though the investigation of relativistic cosmological models usually has the energy momentum tensor of matter generated by a perfect fluid , to consider more realistic models one must take into account the viscosity mechanisms @xcite . on the other hand in the recent years anisotropic cosmological models with nonlinear spinor field have been extensively studied due to the facts that ( i ) introduction of nonlinear spinor field into the system leads to the isotropization of initially anisotropic universe @xcite ; ( ii ) spinor field nonlinearity in some cases can give rise to singularity - free solutions @xcite ; ( iii ) spinor field can be considered as one of the possible candidate to explain the late time acceleration of the universe @xcite .    given the importance of viscous fluid and spinor field to model a realistic universe , recently we have considered a self - consistent system of nonlinear spinor field and a gravitational field described by a bianchi type i ( bi ) cosmological model filled with viscous fluid @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have thoroughly studied the corresponding field equations .",
    "exact solutions of the field equations were given in terms of volume scale of the bi space - time @xmath5 .",
    "multi - parametric system of equations for volume scale @xmath5 , energy density of the viscous fluid @xmath6 was solved for some special choice of bulk and share viscosity . given the richness of the system mentioned above in this report we study it qualitatively for more general cases . in the absence of viscosity",
    "the system allows integrals of motion , whereas it is either impossible obtain , or there is no first integral at all in general when the viscosity is taken into account . as a result the study of possible modes of evolutions becomes very difficult .",
    "undoubtedly , the result of the investigation should be presented in the form of numerical values and at the same time can not be reduced to a representation of some causally found examples of numerical solutions .",
    "clearly , it should be a classification of modes of the evolution in the parametric space .",
    "actually , it is the task of qualitative analysis .",
    "we consider a self - consistent system of nonlinear spinor and bianchi type - i ( bi ) gravitational fields filled with a viscous fluid in presence of a cosmological term . as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the components of the spinor field and metric functions can be expressed in terms of volume scale @xmath5 of the bi space - time .",
    "so one needs to find the function @xmath5 , explicitly .",
    "corresponding equation can be derived from einstein equations and bianchi identity [ a detailed description of this procedure can be found in @xcite ] . for convenience , we also define the generalized hubble constant .",
    "the system then reads :    [ hven1 ] @xmath7 .",

    "are the bulk and shear viscosity , respectively and they are both positively definite , i.e. , @xmath14 they may be either constant or function of time or energy .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being some positive quantities .",
    "for @xmath18 we set as in perfect fluid , @xmath19 . \\label{pzeta}\\ ] ] note that in this case @xmath20 , since for dust pressure , hence temperature is zero , that results in vanishing viscosity .",
    "note that a system in absence of spinor field has been studied in @xcite . in that case",
    "the corresponding system is analogical to the one given in without the third terms in and .",
    "research on the behavior of the dynamic system given by a system of ordinary differential equations implies the survey of all possible scenarios of development for different values of the problem parameters .",
    "it is necessary to understand at least how the process of evolution comes to an end if it does so at infinitively large time for a given set of initial conditions which can be given anywhere .",
    "so , under the specific behavior of the system we understand the phase portrait of the system , i.e. , the family of integral curves , covering the total phase space .",
    "it is easy to imagine as far as any point of the space can be declared as the initial one and at least one integral curve will pass through it ( or it will be fixed point ) .",
    "certainly , it is difficult to imagine such a set of curves . in many cases , close ( and not only )",
    "curves transform into each other at some diffeomorphism of space .",
    "these curves are known as topologically equivalent .",
    "the differences between them are not very important for our study .",
    "they all behave in the same manner .",
    "this relation - `` the relation of equivalence '' - divides the family of curves into the classes of equivalence . for graphical demonstration it will be convenient to present at least one representative of each class .",
    "the change of the value of problem parameters not always results in significant change of the phase portrait . repeating this method",
    ", we say that one family of integral curves ( covering the total space ) for the given set of parameters is equivalent to the other for another set of parameters , if there exists a diffeomorphism of space transforming the first family into the second .",
    "it is clear that there occurs the division into the classes of equivalence , and we are not very interested in differences between equivalent families .",
    "we argue that the corresponding changes in parameters do not alter anything on principle .",
    "so it is sufficient to demonstrate only one phase portrait for a given set of parameters underlining the features of the given class .",
    "however , for some critical relations between the parameters there occurs significant changes .",
    "these are the boundary relations of parameters , dividing , as usual , parameter space into regions of similar behavior .",
    "thus accomplishes the qualitative classification of the mode of evolution of dynamic system .",
    "now , giving the concrete value of parameters , we can define which region of parameters they correspond to , thus define the type of behavior .",
    "moreover , given the specific initial conditions , we can answer the question to which region of phase space the evolution of the system lead in time .    in our cosmological model , numerical parameters @xmath16 , @xmath21 , @xmath17 , @xmath22",
    "are related to the viscosity , while @xmath23 and @xmath0 are the ( self)-coupling and cosmological constants .",
    "initially , we consider the system of einstein and dirac equations . solving these equations , we find the components of the spinor field and metric functions @xmath24 in terms of volume scale @xmath25 of the bi universe . finally , in order to find @xmath5 from einstein equations and bianchi identity , we deduce three first order ordinary differential equations .",
    "further for convenience we introduce a new function @xmath26 inverse to @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that the system has the dimension greater than 2 , strongly complicates qualitative analysis . note that well known lorentz system of three ordinary differential equations with polynomial right hand side with degree less or equal to 2 , possesses in some region of parameter space chaotic behavior known as a strange attractor and in that region there do not exist first integrals ( i.e. , globally defined invariants ) . though the set of singularities is very simple , there exist only three singular ( fixed ) points : two focus and one saddle .",
    "the presence of such example does not allow us to make an optimistic conclusion on the basis of simple construction of our system ( with polynomials in the right hand side and absence of singular points the in region of space we are interest in , which is even dynamically closed .    nevertheless , on the boundary of the the space @xmath28 , as well as @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , which are dynamically closed themselves , the complete classification has been done .",
    "the dynamical closeness of these planes simultaneously as an obstacle for penetration from positive octant @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 to the region with negative values .",
    "but , there are no singularities , fixed points ( there are fixed points on the boundary ) in the positive octant , we were not able to prove the simplicity of its behavior , e.g. , presence of first integrals , as well as their absence .    thus let us go back to the system in details . as it was already mentioned , tt is convenient to define a new function @xmath27 . in this case",
    "the obvious singularity that occurs at @xmath34 vanishes and @xmath35 corresponds to @xmath36 while @xmath37 to @xmath34 .",
    "the system on account of takes the form :    [ hven2 ] @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{ven2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us now study the foregoing system of equations in details .",
    "let us first study the behavior of the functions @xmath39 and @xmath5 on @xmath35 plane .",
    "the plane @xmath35 is dynamically invariant , since @xmath40 it should be emphasized that the system in this case coincides with one in absence on spinor field and was thoroughly studied in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we write the results obtained in detail . in doing",
    "so we rewrite the eqs . and in the matrix form : @xmath41    * a ) * by virtu of linear independence of the columns of the matrix of the eq .",
    "the critical points are the solutions of the equations    [ cheq ] @xmath42    i.e. , they necessarily lie on the parabola . in view of @xmath43 which follows from , the eq . can be written as @xmath44 the solutions to the system will be the roots of the eq . . the quantity of the positive roots of eq .",
    "according to cartesian law is equal to the number of changes of sign of the coefficients of equations or less than that by an even number .",
    "so , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 or @xmath47 and @xmath48 the number of roots is either @xmath49 or zero . for the remaining cases ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 or @xmath45 and @xmath48 or @xmath47 and @xmath52 there exists only one root .    in table 1",

    "so it is sufficient to consider the case with maximum number of roots .",
    "taking into account the eqs . and",
    "let us now calculate @xmath71",

    "it is obvious that there can be no more than three roots , hence there can not be non - concentric cycles . as a result ,",
    "near the plane @xmath90 there might be cyclic oscillations .",
    "the singular point around which the oscillation takes place has @xmath107 , and therefore , the trajectory of oscillation partially passes in the region which is attractive to the plane @xmath90 and partially in the region that is repulsive . in the long run in the repulsive region at some moment the growth of @xmath6 becomes dominant .",
    "it results in the fact that @xmath6 becomes infinity within a finite range of time .",

    "the second one , i.e. , eq . under @xmath110 ceases to be the integral of motion .",
    "nevertheless , the introduction of bulk viscosity during the course of time generates definite displacement of the surface given by the formula , which allows one qualitatively , i.e. , based only on the continuity , compile the representation about the possible ways of evolution .",

    "@xmath90 and @xmath35 the integral curves closely repeats the integral curves on the sides , each time at least to some extent .",
    "the general property of all the cases is the fact that in the half - space @xmath85 the velocity vectors are directed to the @xmath112 plane , while in the other half opposite to it . as a result",
