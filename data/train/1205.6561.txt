    "the dynamics in complex network has been intensively studied , since the proposal of the small world network and the scale - free network.@xcite in the scale - free network , the degree distribution obeys a power law .",
    "barabsi and albert showed that a power grid in western united states was a typical example of scale - free networks.@xcite however , there is a controversy on the degree distribution of power grids .",
    "some authors reported power - law distributions , whereas others reported exponential distributions.@xcite the distribution might be different for different countries and regions . in some regions , a two - dimensional planar network might be a good approximation .",
    "furthermore , there is a hierarchical structure from the load dispatching center to power stations via many transformer substations in electric power systems .",
    "a serious issue in power grids is a large - scale failure of power supply , called a blackout.@xcite a large - scale blackout or a cascade failure in a power grid network can have disastrous consequences in modern society . from a viewpoint of statistical physics ,",
    "several simple models have been proposed to study the cascade failure.@xcite an abstract network is assumed for a power system in these models .",
    "the nodes in the network correspond to generators or consumers and the links correspond to transmission lines . some removal rules of links in the network were assumed to simulate an elemental failure process .",
    "a cascade failure could be reproduced by numerical simulation of some simple models , and analytical theories were proposed .",
    "however , in actual alternating current ( ac ) systems , not only the network structure but also the electric potentials or phase variables are important to quantitatively describe a large - scale failure of power supply .",
    "for example , there is a phenomenon called voltage collapse , which occurs in power grids . in a voltage collapse , the electric potential at a consumer ( a load )",
    "can not be maintained at a stable stationary value and power supply to the load becomes impossible when the power demand is beyond a threshold , which can lead to a large - scale blackout .",
    "taking the importance of phase variables into consideration , several authors proposed coupled oscillator models similar to the kuramoto model as a model of power grids , and synchronization transition was studied in the models.@xcite in synchronous generators , the generator turbine is driven by mechanical power , and the rotational motion is directly transformed into the sinusoidal oscillation of an alternating current .",
    "the phase variable of the alternating current for the @xmath0th generator is denoted as @xmath1 .",
    "the power produced at a generator is dissipated , accumulated , and transmitted along the electric transmission line .",
    "the output power is expressed using a sinusoidal function of the phase difference between the generators in the ac system .",
    "a simple energy balance equation leads to a set of phase equations : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the standard frequency , @xmath5 is the damping constant , @xmath6 is related to the input power supplied to the @xmath0th element , and @xmath7 is the coupling constant .",
    "the phase variable @xmath8 denotes the difference between @xmath1 and the phase advance @xmath9 by the standard frequency .",
    "the authors performed some numerical simulations and obtained some theoretical results .",
    "when the damping effect is sufficiently large , the kuramoto model is recovered as @xmath10 phase transitions in globally coupled systems were studied in ref .",
    "11 and ref .  12 .",
    "recently , synchronization in scale - free networks has been studied by several authors  @xcite , and a model with two subpopulations corresponding to generators and loads was also studied in ref .  16 . in these models ,",
    "the mutual synchronization is a main issue of research . as a result of the mutual synchronization , a macroscopic oscillation with a certain average frequency appears .",
    "the average frequency of the macroscopic oscillation is determined internally by self - organization in coupled oscillators , such as eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .    however , it is important to maintain the standard frequency @xmath4 at a constant value , such as 50 hz or 60 hz , in electric power systems .",
    "if the power demand exceeds a critical value , the standard frequency can not be maintained , and the frequency begins to depart from the standard value .",
    "this is called loss of synchronization or step out . a step out seriously affects power grids . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new phase model of power grids , composed of sources ( generators ) and consumers ( loads ) , that can simulate the occurrence of the step out phenomenon .",
    "we numerically study cascade failure in an artificially constructed networks : a square lattice and a scale - free network .",
    "the numerical results are compared with a mean - field approximation .",
    "details on electric power systems , including actual generators , can be found in textbooks on electrical engineering , e.g. , ref .",
    "17 . in this paper",
    ", we study a very simplified model that includes generators and loads , although actual power systems are more complicated . for generators , we extend the phase model described by eq .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath8 is written as @xmath11 where @xmath5 is the damping constant , @xmath6 is related to the input power , and @xmath12 denotes the effective output power .",
    "note that @xmath13 denotes the deviation of the frequency of the @xmath0th generator from the standard frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the output power @xmath12 is expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electric potential at the @xmath0th node , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 denotes the resistance between the @xmath0th and @xmath19th nodes , and @xmath20 denotes the impedance between these two nodes . if @xmath21 , then @xmath22 , and the sine of the phase difference @xmath23 multiplied by @xmath24 contributes to the effective power .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is taken for all @xmath19 nodes , including the generators and loads linked to the @xmath0th generator . in this paper , for simplicity , the output voltage @xmath15 for generators is assumed to take a constant value @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast to the models studied in ref .  8 and ref .  9",
    ", the proposed model incorporates an additional equation to keep the effective frequency @xmath26 at zero .",
    "we use a simple feedback control system expressed as @xmath27 this feedback control works as follows .",
    "if @xmath26 is positive or the effective frequency is too fast , the input power is decreased .",
    "conversely , if @xmath26 is negative or the effective frequency is too slow , the input power is increased .",
    "if the feedback control works well , the effective frequency @xmath28 is maintained at zero . under this condition ,",
    "the entire power system , which includes the generators and loads , is synchronized at the standard frequency @xmath4 , such as 50 hz or 60 hz . in actual power generators ,",
    "the frequency is controlled by a local feedback using governors and a global regulation by the control center .",
    "equation ( 5 ) corresponds to the local feedback by governors .",
    "equation ( 5 ) implies that @xmath29const . if the constant is set to zero , then @xmath30 .",
    "then , eq .  ( 3 ) takes a form similar to that of the equation of motion of a damping harmonic oscillator with an output power term .",
    "@xmath31 this is our model equation for generators .",
    "the form of the equation is similar to that of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ; however , the dynamical behavior is rather different from that in the case of eq .",
    "if the power demand expressed by @xmath12 is too large , the input power @xmath6 can not respond to the excessive demand .",
    "if the generators become overloaded , they might break down . to avoid a breakdown ,",
    "the generators might be stopped .",
    "in such an event , the overall synchronization would be lost ; that is , a loss of synchronization or step out would occur , which might lead to a cascade failure . to express such a situation , we assume a simple rule that @xmath15 is set to zero if @xmath6 is beyond a critical value @xmath32 . if @xmath33 is set to zero , the function of the generator is lost .",
    "it is equivalent to effectively removing the generator node @xmath0 from the power network system .    for loads , on the other hand , we use different energy balance equations .",
    "that is , we assume that definite quantities of effective power @xmath34 and reactive power @xmath35 are consumed at each load @xmath0 . the complex power @xmath36 is expressed as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the current supplied to the electric devices at the @xmath0th node , and @xmath39 implies the complex conjugate .",
    "the current @xmath38 is expressed as @xmath40 using the difference between the electric potentials and the admittance . here",
    ", @xmath41 is denoted as @xmath42 .",
    "the powers @xmath34 and @xmath35 are therefore expressed as @xmath43 the summation is taken for all sites @xmath19 , including the generators and loads linked to the @xmath0th node .",
    "equations ( 7 ) are coupled algebraic equations .",
    "the phase @xmath8 and electric potential @xmath15 are determined for each @xmath0 by solving eq .",
    "( 7 ) for specified values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we have numerically solved the coupled equations ( 7 ) with an iterative method . generally ,",
    "if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are sufficiently small , both stable and unstable stationary solutions exist for @xmath15 .",
    "however , if the effective power @xmath34 is gradually increased as a control parameter , the magnitude of a stable solution @xmath15 decreases and that of an unstable one increases . at a critical value of @xmath34 ,",
    "a transition occurs such that the stable and unstable solutions merge and disappear .",
    "there are no stationary solutions beyond the critical value .",
    "this phenomenon is called voltage collapse .",
    "if a voltage collapse occurs , the voltage @xmath15 decreases rapidly , which can lead to an electric failure of the power supply .",
    "a voltage collapse occurs more easily if the reactive power @xmath35 is large .",
    "if a voltage collapse occurs , there is no stationary solution in the coupled equations ( 7 ) . in our simple model ,",
    "we have assumed another rule that @xmath15 is set to zero when @xmath33 decreases to zero .",
    "this operation is equivalent to removing the load node @xmath0 from the network of power grids , because @xmath15 appears as a coefficient for the interaction terms in eq .",
    "thus , we have proposed a new simple phase model of power grids with two removal rules .",
    "the two removal rules simulate the situations of step out and the voltage collapse .",
    "our model is similar to the models in ref .  6 and ref .  7 in that some removal rules are assumed . at the same time , our phase model has a form similar to that of eq .",
    "( 1 ) studied in ref .  8 and ref .",
    "9 , although the dynamical behavior is rather different because feedback control is very important in our model .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of coupled equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) on a scale - free network for the sake of simplicity , although real power - grids are not regular square lattice and a scale - free network .",
    "our model systems can be easily applied to other types of networks . actually , we have performed numerical simulation on a square lattice and found cascade failure .",
    "the scale - free network is constructed using the preferential attachment method of barabsi and albert .",
    "new nodes are randomly assigned as being generators with probability @xmath44 or loads with probability @xmath45 .",
    "in this paper , we show some numerical results for a uniform system where the parameters do not depend on @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . the total number of nodes is denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "some parameters in this paper are fixed , namely , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , whereas @xmath51 and @xmath52 are changed as control parameters .",
    "figure 1 shows a numerical result of a scale - free network of @xmath53 at @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "there are 15 generators and 85 loads in this network .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows a network at @xmath58 , where no failure occurs .",
    "the rhombi denote generator nodes and the plus signs denote load nodes .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows a network at @xmath59 , which is a stationary state .",
    "the input power @xmath6 of one generator @xmath60 of degree 14 goes beyond the critical value @xmath61 , and a loss of synchronization occurs ; hence , the voltage @xmath15 is set to zero .",
    "the generator node @xmath60 is one of the hubs with large degree .",
    "the power demand to the other generators increases by the effective removal of this generator . as a result",
    ", a loss of synchronization occurs successively at two other generator nodes , namely , @xmath62 of degree 24 and @xmath63 of degree 13 .",
    "meanwhile , as a result of the shortage of the power supply , a large - scale voltage collapse occurs for the load nodes .",
    "when the voltage collapse occurs , the load nodes are effectively removed .",
    "then , the successive loss of synchronization stops , because power demand to the other generators decreases .",
    "finally , 12 generators and 5 loads survive in this numerical simulation , as shown in fig .",
    "as the numerical simulation suggests , the loss of synchronization tends to occur like a cascade failure ; however , the voltage collapse tends to suppress the cascade failure because the power demand decreases when the load nodes are removed .    .",

    "the generator nodes that exhibit step out and the load nodes that exhibit voltage collapse are removed ; moreover , the links leaving the removed nodes are also removed . ]",
    "our system can be simplified with a mean - field approximation .",
    "the mean - field approximation is considered to be good if the degree of each node is sufficiently large .",
    "a similar mean - field analysis was performed for coupled phase oscillators in a scale - free network.@xcite note that @xmath65 is assumed in the following equations .",

    "the voltage @xmath69 takes a constant value @xmath71 when the generator nodes do not exhibit step out , and it becomes zero when the generator nodes exhibit step out . on the other hand , @xmath70 s are determined by coupled equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) and become zero if the loads exhibit voltage collapse .",
