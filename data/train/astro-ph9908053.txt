    "the study of emission lines in spiral galaxies has proven to be very useful in determining the distribution of ionized gas , and the physical conditions at the central regions ( burbidge & burbidge 1960a , 1960b , 1962 , 1964 , 1965 ; burbidge , burbidge & pendergast 1960 ; keel 1983a , b ; kennicutt & kent 1983 ; heckman , balick & crane 1980 ; stauffer 1982a , b ; kennicutt 1992a , b ; appenzeller & streicher 1988 ; filippenko & sargent 1985 ; ho , filippenko & sargent 1995 , 1997a , b ; vaceli et al .",

    "optical observations of barred spiral galaxies usually show the presence of symmetric structures around their center ( presumably in the plane of the disk ) which are referred to as _ rings _ ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these symmetric structures are observed at different radii in their host galaxy ; some are seen as extended structures at @xmath5 kpc from the center , but some others are located about @xmath6 kpc , and there are circumnuclear rings at @xmath7 pc from the compact nucleus ( e.g. @xcite,1989b ; @xcite , b,1996 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a dynamical explanation for the origin of the structures has been sought in terms of non - symmetric perturbations to the ` normal ' gravitational potential of spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the standard model to explain the formation of circumnuclear structures requieres knowledge of the angular velocity of the gas and stars ( @xmath8 ) , the epiclyclic frequencies ( @xmath9 ) , and an estimate of the angular velocity of the bar ( @xmath10 ) . in this model",
    ", it is generally assumed that the gravitational potential of the bar and @xmath10 are independent of time ( @xcite ) .",
    "some of these galaxies have nearby neighbors and many numerical models have been carried out to examine the possible role of tidal interactions in the formation of bars and symmetric structures ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we present new optical spectroscopic observations of the central regions of 18 barred galaxies using a long slit .",
    "our main purpose is to provide local velocities and line ratios from the emission lines of [ nii ] , h@xmath2 , and [ sii ] , for both the nucleus and the circumnuclear regions .",
    "we have tried to obtain spectra of the compact nucleus and from the immediate surroundings separately ( in the east and west directions since the slit was oriented at pa@xmath13 e of n ) by adding only the corresponding pixels in the slit .",
    "a clear example of this is in ngc 6951 , where the spatial distribution of h@xmath2 shows the compact nucleus in addition to a circumnuclear ring .",
    "ngc 4314 also presents the circumnuclear ring in h@xmath2 , but no emission from the compact nucleus is detected in this case .",
    "in other six galaxies the spatial distribution of the h@xmath2 emission is more diffuse . in 10 galaxies we were only able to obtain a spectrum of the central emission : compact nucleus and weak ( if present at all ) extranuclear emission .",

    "they also pointed out that the observed ratio is larger than 1 in the nucleus of some galaxies .",
    "more recent observations of several emission lines , with better sensitivity and spectral coverage , have been used to determine the excitation mechanisms in different objects ( @xcite ) . in particular , the emission lines used are : [ nev]@xmath92  , [ oii]@xmath93  , h@xmath94  , heii @xmath95  , [ oiii]@xmath96  , [ oi ] @xmath97  , h@xmath98  , [ nii]@xmath99  . depending on the line ratios , the excitation mechanisms for the line - emitting gas could be : a ) photoionization by ob stars , b ) photoionization by a power - law continuum source , c ) collisional ionization from shock waves , and d ) a combination of the above .",
    "actually , the nuclear regions are usually excited by a power - law source but the circumnuclear rings are excited by uv radiation from recently formed stars .",
    "recent spectroscopic surveys of spiral galaxies show low - ionization emission , suggesting that a flat - spectrum ( power law ) radiation field photoionizes the nuclear gas ( keel 1983a , b , c;@xcite ; ho , filippenko & sargent 1995 , 1997a , b ; @xcite ) . in the nucleus of seyfert galaxies the same mechanism seems to operate and",

    "this is in line with the expectations from galactic dynamics , where large accumulations of material can occur at regions near lindblad resonances , hence , providing suitable conditions for triggering the formation of stars .",
    "our results corroborate these views , and we find that the photionizing agents for the nuclear gas and the circumnuclear rings are of different nature .",

    "the [ nii]@xmath906548/h@xmath2 ratio is on average @xmath103 in the eastern side , @xmath104 in the western side ( table 2 ) .",
    "the ratio is @xmath105 for galaxies without extranuclear emission ( table 3 ) .",
    "the [ nii]@xmath906583/h@xmath2 ratio is on the average @xmath106 in the eastern side and @xmath107 in the western side .",
    "the average ratio is @xmath108 for galaxies presenting spectra from their central regions without circumnuclear structures .",
    "the values found are in agreement with the values found in other barred galaxies like ngc 1097 ( @xcite ) .    in the case of ngc 4314 and ngc 6951 , with clear circumnuclear rings ,",
    "the line ratio was found different from each side of the ring .",
    "the [ nii]@xmath906583/h@xmath2 ratios in ngc 4314 are 0.45 and 0.85 while in ngc 6951 they are 0.48 and 0.93 from their eastern and western circumnuclear regions , respectively .",
    "these values suggest different intrinsic physical conditions as a result of local star formation and evolution in each side of the ring .",
    "we believe that the ratio of [ nii]@xmath3/h@xmath2 of 1.01 quoted by @xcite for ngc 4314 represents the ratio from the western side of the circumnuclear ring and not necessarily from the compact nucleus since images suggest that there is no h@xmath2 emission from the compact nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the ratio [ nii]@xmath3/h@xmath2 from the compact nucleus of ngc 6951 is about 2 , in agreement with previous values reported ( @xcite )",
    ". figure  [ fig3 ] shows the spectrum corresponding to the compact nucleus of ngc 6951 .",
    "ngc 4477 and ngc 5728 also show a ratio of [ nii]@xmath906583/h@xmath2 of @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively , in accord to values found previously ( @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies are classified as seyfert 2 galaxies with physical characteristics that account for the ratio observed in the nucleus ( @xcite ) .      the ratio of [ sii]/h@xmath2 is found in the range from 0.07 to 0.2 with no obvious difference in either side of circumnuclear regions .",
    "it is in the range from 0.1 to 0.3 from the compact nucleus in galaxies with circumnuclear structures and it is 0.1 to 0.4 in central regions of galaxies without circumnuclear regions ( see tables 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the lower values seem to be from the eastern and western side of the nuclei , but further observations with longer integration times and wider slits are needed to confirm this .",
    "ratios with larger values from nuclei and low values from circumnuclear regions have been found in ngc 1097 ( @xcite ) and ngc 5728 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the [ sii]@xmath111/[sii]@xmath112 ratio was found to be in the interval from 0.6 to 1.4 , suggesting electron densities of a few hundred particles per @xmath113 ( see tables 4 and 5 ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented new long slit spectroscopic observations with [ nii ] , h@xmath2 and [ sii ] emission lines from 18 rsa barred spiral galaxies , eight of which have structures around the nucleus .",
    "the main results are the following : a ) we were able to determine the heliocentric optical velocities for the ionized gas from the compact nucleus , and the eastern and western regions , in eight galaxies . with these velocities",
    "we have estimated the inner dynamical mass of each galaxy assuming that the gas move in circular orbits on the plane of the galaxy .",
    "b ) we were able to estimate the line ratios [ nii]@xmath114/h@xmath2 , [ nii]@xmath3/h@xmath2 , [ sii]@xmath111/h@xmath2 and [ sii]@xmath115/h@xmath2 for the eastern , western , and compact nuclear regions , separately , of eight galaxies .",
    "in particular , we found that in galaxies with clear circumnuclear rings , as in ngc 4314 and ngc 6951 , the ratio [ nii]@xmath3/h@xmath2 is lower in the eastern region than in the western region of the ring suggesting different local physical conditions as a result of star formation and evolution .",
    "c ) in ngc 4477 , ngc 5728 and ngc 6951 we found that the ratio [ nii]@xmath3/h@xmath2 is larger than unity in the central nuclear regions , in agreement with values reported .",
