    "spin - crossover ( sc ) transitions between the low spin ( ls ) state and the high spin ( hs ) state are induced by changes in temperature , pressure , photoirradiation , etc.@xcite because the ls or hs state is realized due to subtle balance of the interaction between the electrons and the ligand field .",
    "phenomena originating from these transitions have attracted much attention because they would potentially produce various functional devices@xcite . among them , photoinduced phase transition is a current topic in the field of molecular metal complex solids .",
    "there , much effort has been dedicated to reversible controls of magnetic , electronic , structural properties , etc.@xcite .",
    "molecular sc solids and prussian blue analogs ( pba ) are typical materials that exhibit such properties . in order to understand the phenomena ,",
    "it is necessary to study the dynamical processes of the transitions of photoexcitation and the relaxation of electronic states , where various cooperative effects play important roles .",
    "thus , photoinduced non - equilibrium dynamics is now an area of intense study @xcite .",
    "it has been clarified that sc transitions are not assembly of independent transitions between two electronic states in individual molecules but cooperative phenomena in correlated molecules between a nonmagnetic ( ls , diamagnetic ) phase and a magnetic ( hs , paramagnetic ) phase @xcite .",
    "wajnflasz and pick ( wp ) @xcite theoretically gave the ground of the mechanism of the cooperative transitions by using an ising model with degeneracies .",
    "the wp - model and extended wp - models have explained successfully static and dynamical properties of various cases of sc transitions@xcite .",
    "the discovery of liesst ( lightinduced excited spin state trapping ) @xcite has led to a number of studies concerning relaxation during and after irradiation .",
    "the self - accelerated relaxation of hs fraction after irradiation and lightinduced thermal hysteresis , which are typical features in experiments , were reproduced by an ising - like model based on the wp - model with arrhenius dynamics @xcite .",
    "to reproduce the relaxation dynamics with a slowing down at long time , a treatment beyond mean - filed approaches is necessary@xcite , where short range correlations ( and sometimes long range correlations ) between molecules and spatially non - uniform fluctuation are important .    in a series of related experiments ,",
    "a photoinduced magnetic phase transition was observed in co - fe prussian blue analogues ( pba )  @xcite . at low temperatures , pba shows the transition : fe@xmath0(s=0 ) + co@xmath1(s=0 ) @xmath2 fe@xmath0(s=1/2 ) + co@xmath1(s=3/2 ) by photoirradiation . in the equilibrium ,",
    "the system is in the ls ( the left hand side ) state which is a nonmagnetic state . by the photoirradiation",
    ", the system has a spontaneous magnetization where the spin state is in the hs ( the right hand side ) state .",
    "furthermore a reversible switching between the ls and hs states by irradiations with different frequencies was observed in this compound .",
    "there , the magnetic interaction between the high spins should play an important role in addition to the lattice interaction which drives the ls - hs transition . then , to study such multi - functional phenomena , it has become indispensable to establish a unified formulation which allows us to treat both sc transition and magnetic order - disorder transition simultaneously .    in order to investigate the reversible switching mechanism of magnetization ,",
    "the blume - capel ( bc ) model@xcite , which has a long - lived metastable ferromagnetic state in a parameter region , was studied@xcite .",
    "there , the dynamical process of the two - way switching was explained by focusing on the magnetic interaction and the multi - time scales of microscopic processes , e.g. , the ls - hs transition , spin flip , and photoexcitation .    for cooperated phenomena of the spin - crossover transition and magnetic ordering ,",
    "we have proposed a unified model in which both the inter - molecular lattice interaction and the inter - molecular magnetic interaction are taken into account@xcite .",
    "this generalized model includes both the wp and bc models as special cases and enables us to treat the spin - crossover phenomena and magnetic ordering in a unified way .",
    "we have studied static properties of the model , and obtained its phase diagram as a function of the magnetic and lattice coupling parameters@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamical properties of the generalized model . in particular , we investigate the dynamical properties of the magnetization and the hs fraction under temperature cycles after photoirradiation , and we also study the process under photoirradiation , motivated by the available experiments on pba@xcite .    in order to study the dynamical aspects , we consider a master equation with multi - time scales where the relative relation of the relaxation times of the processes , e.g. , transition between the ls and hs states , spin flip , and photoexcitation , plays an important role .",
    "we adopt here arrhenius dynamics to realize the slow dynamics of the ls@xmath3hs transition at low temperatures , while we use standard glauber dynamics for fast relaxation of the spin flip process .",
    "the process of photoexcitation is taken into account by a local excitation process from the ls state ( 0 ) to the hs state with up or down magnetization ( @xmath4 ) with the same probability .",
    "the strength of the irradiation is controlled in our formulation .    in the present analysis ,",
    "the following properties are clarified . because the interaction between spins is considered ,",
    "the typical shapes of the increase of not only the hs fraction but also magnetization by photoirradiation at low temperatures are naturally observed as non - linear functions of irradiation time@xcite .",
    "experimentally , it has been observed that the hs fraction and magnetization change drastically depending on the temperature cycling processes@xcite .",
    "here , we theoretically study the mechanism of the dynamics under various temperature cycles . in a cycle , we first prepare saturated magnetization under photoirradiation , and after turning off the irradiation the system is warmed up to a certain temperature , and it is cooled down to the initial temperature .",
    "it is found that in the low temperature region where the excited high spin state has a strong metastability , the magnetization almost exactly follows the quasi - static process . on the other hand , if the temperature is raised above the region , the dynamics of the spin state and the magnetization couple and exhibit various types of dynamical cooperative phenomena under time - dependent control of temperature and photoirradiation .",
    "our model explains qualitatively the novel behavior found in the experiments@xcite , and also predicts new phenomena which give useful suggestions for related experiments of photoinduced hysteresis phenomena@xcite .",

    "the time scale of spin inversion ( @xmath31 ) is considered to be much faster than that between ls and hs transition ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) because the latter is accompanied by a structural change . to describe the relaxation process between the hs and ls states adequately",

    "we adopt standard glauber type evolution between @xmath34 and @xmath35 for fast relaxation of the spin flip process . with these choices the difference between the dynamics of ls@xmath3hs transition and spin flip can be effectively taken into account .    in arrhenius dynamics",

    ", we take @xmath54 .",

    "in this section , we study three kinds of temperature cycles ( heating and cooling ) after switching off irradiation to simulate the experiments@xcite .",
    "first , the system is irradiated ( @xmath65 ) at a very low temperature ( @xmath66 ) under a magnetic field ( @xmath67 ) until the state becomes the saturated magnetic hs state ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .    in fig.[initial_photo ]",
    "we show the time evolution of @xmath70 ( solid line ) and that of @xmath71 ( dashed line ) at @xmath72 under irradiation with @xmath67 .",
    "the change of @xmath70 follows that of @xmath71 because at this low temperature the magnetic moments of excited hs states rapidly align in the direction of the magnetic field due to the magnetic interaction .",
    "here , we find characteristic time evolution of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "that is , at the beginning of the irradiation , @xmath70 and @xmath71 increase slowly with concave shapes .",
    "then , they are accelerated and finally saturate slowly with convex shapes .",
    "this time dependence is consistent with the experiments@xcite .",
    "this result indicates the following . at the beginning of the photoirradiation ,",
    "the irradiation makes local excited hs states but the cooperative effect tends to put them back to ls states because almost all neighboring sites are in the ls state , and thus the growth of @xmath71 and @xmath70 is suppressed .",
    "it should be noted that this initial suppression is due to the cooperative interaction between ls sites . in the present scheme ,",
    "this effect is automatically taken into account .",
    "when the number of hs sites is increased , the cooperative effect between hs sites becomes significant , resulting in the acceleration of @xmath71 and @xmath70 .    after switching off the irradiation and field (",
    "setting @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , we change the temperature .",
    "the temperature is gradually increased up to @xmath75 , and then decreased to the initial temperature @xmath72 ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) .",
    "here we change the temperature in 1k steps . at each temperature , first @xmath77 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) are discarded for a transient time , and then @xmath77mcs is used to measure the quantities .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the quantities denotes their time dependence .",
    "the following three cases are studied .",
    "( a ) @xmath78k , ( b ) @xmath79k and ( c ) @xmath80k .",
    "we will see that , depending on the value of @xmath75 , the system shows qualitatively different dynamical behavior of @xmath71 and @xmath70 .",
    "the time ( and temperature ) dependence of @xmath70 ( solid line ) and that of @xmath71 ( dashed line ) in process a are depicted in fig .",
    "the magnetization @xmath70 decreases with heating and disappears around @xmath81k .",
    "the magnetization in the cooling process almost exactly follows that in the warming process .",
    "this indicates that the dynamics of @xmath70 follows the quasi - static magnetization process .",
    "it is noted that @xmath82 is constant during the whole process .",
    "although the free energy in the static mean - field theory for the equilibrium state as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath71 does not have metastability for @xmath68 , the strong metastability of @xmath68 appears as a result of arrhenius kinetics with a relatively large @xmath83 as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "indeed , it is found that the metastability appears in the dynamical mean - field theory , where the time evolution of the magnetization is given by the van hove equation : @xmath84 as far as @xmath85 at low temperatures , the free energy is given by @xmath86 where a double well potential of @xmath70 is realized .",
    "thus , under the metastability of @xmath71(=1 ) , @xmath70 behaves quasi - statically and shows a typical temperature dependence of the second - order magnetic transition in both warming and cooling processes . assuming @xmath68 , the transition temperature is given by the curie temperature of 3d ising model on the simple cubic lattice@xcite : @xmath87k .",
    "this quasi - static behavior is consistent with experiments@xcite .",
    "next , we study a case with a high value of @xmath75 ( @xmath79k , case b ) .",
    "figure  [ hight ] shows the time ( and temperature ) dependence of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "now we find self - accelerated ( sigmoidal ) relaxation of @xmath71 in the region 90 - 110k , above which @xmath71 disappears until the sc transition occurs at a higher temperature .",
    "we find hysteresis behavior in the region 160 - 220k which is due to the sc transition .",
    "the dependence of @xmath71 and that of @xmath70 on the temperature cycle have been found in the experiments of pba@xcite . in the process , the magnetic interaction has negligible contribution to the thermal transition of @xmath71 because of @xmath88 .",
    "thus the transition point of the spin crossover where @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 because @xmath91 is less than the ising phase transition point : @xmath92 , the system exhibits the first - order phase transition at @xmath91@xcite .",
    "thus , the center of the hysteresis depends on @xmath93 and @xmath11 and the width of the hysteresis depends on the ratio @xmath94 for fixed @xmath11 and the changing rate of the temperature , which indicates varieties of hysteresis loops in the experiments@xcite . after arriving at @xmath95",
    "the system is cooled down . in the cooling process below the spontaneous thermal hysteresis region ,",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 are zero , where the system is in the equilibrium state .",
    "if we stop warming at some temperature on the way to @xmath75 from @xmath72 in process b and maintain the temperature , we observe characteristic sigmoidal relaxations of @xmath71 with a tail as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sigmoidal_relax ] .",
    "these relaxation curves with temperature dependence are also observed commonly in the related experiments@xcite .",
    "let us consider the third case c ( @xmath96k ) .",
    "just before arriving at this @xmath75 in the warming process , @xmath71 begins to relax . in fig .",
    "[ middlet ] , the time ( and temperature ) dependence of @xmath70 ( solid line ) and that of @xmath71 ( dashed line ) are plotted .",
    "the relaxation of @xmath71 is observable until @xmath97k in the cooling process .",
    "the quantitative relaxation profile depends on the changing rate of the temperature , but qualitative features are common .",
    "when the temperature is further decreased , @xmath71 freezes with a non - saturated value of @xmath98 . because @xmath99 , the substrate for the magnetic order is in a sense diluted , and the magnetic transition temperature in the cooling process is lower than the curie temperature @xmath100 for @xmath68 . in this process ,",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are large .",
    "thus , we take average over ten independent simulations , and plot the average with error bars in fig .",
    "[ middlet ] .",
    "this lowering of the magnetic transition temperatures was observed also in the experiments@xcite .",
    "in this section , we investigate the time ( and temperature ) dependence of the order parameters under photoirradiation , which would give useful suggestions to related experiments .",
    "we study the same temperature cycle as b under photoirradiation ( @xmath101 ) . in fig.[photo ] ( a ) , the time ( and temperature ) dependence of @xmath71 under the irradiation ( dotted line ) is shown in comparison with the data in the case of no irradiation ( same dashed line as in fig.3 ) . because photoexcitation enhances the hs state and suppresses the relaxation of @xmath71 , the thermal hysteresis of @xmath71 in the region 160 - 220 k",
    "is shifted to the low temperature side .",
    "in addition , lightinduced hysteresis is observed at lower temperatures ( 10 - 120 k ) .",
    "the sigmoidal relaxation of @xmath71 , which is the right branch of this hysteresis , starts at a higher temperature than in the case with no irradiation .",
    "this tendency is consistent with the dynamical mean - field analysis of the ising - like model@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ photo ] ( b ) , the time ( and temperature ) dependence of @xmath70 ( solid line ) and that of @xmath71 ( dotted line ) are shown , focusing on the low temperature region . in the warming process , @xmath70 disappears at a transition temperature which is the same as @xmath100 .",
    "indeed we find eq .",
    "( [ f_van_hove ] ) has no @xmath52-dependence when @xmath68 under irradiation ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in the cooling process , @xmath70 appears at a temperature lower than @xmath100(@xmath103k ) .",
    "the irradiation causes growth of the hs fraction @xmath71 around 30k and after a delay the magnetic order appears at @xmath104k . before the full saturation of @xmath71 , the hs sites have a diluted distribution ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "thus , the critical temperature of the magnetization is lower than @xmath100 . at the critical point @xmath105 , the high spin fraction is @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ photo ] ( b ) .    for this value of @xmath71",
    ", the magnetic order should appear at 0.53@xmath100@xcite in the randomly diluted lattice ( percolated lattice ) .",
    "the present @xmath107 is higher than this value , which should be attributed to correlated high spin states .",
    "the nature of this correlation of the hs sites will be studied in detail elsewhere .",
    "the present observation suggests that if the temperature at which the left branch of the photoinduced hysteresis of @xmath71 appears is near @xmath100 , we find the magnetic hysteresis driven by the photoinduced hysteresis of @xmath71 in the temperature cycle .",
    "if @xmath71 appears at a much higher temperature , the temperature dependence of @xmath70 is the same as that in the warming process .",
    "we expect that this magnetic hysteresis will be found in experiments by controlling the strength of irradiation .",
    "we have presented a three - state model which allows us to describe both sc and magnetic properties of pba with photoirradiation . by using this model , the time ( and temperature ) dependence of magnetization ( @xmath70 ) and",
    "that of the high spin fraction ( @xmath71 ) were observed under several temperature cycling processes . in the case of the temperature cycle in the low temperature region ( @xmath78k )",
    ", the second order magnetic transition takes place at the curie temperature ( @xmath108k ) of the corresponding 3d ising model in both the warming and cooling processes , because the strong metastable high spin state is realized ( @xmath85 ) in this temperature region .",
    "when @xmath75 is high ( @xmath109k ) , @xmath71 disappears showing the self - accelerated ( sigmoidal ) relaxation , and it appears again at a high temperature and the thermal hysteresis of spin crossover is observed . in the cooling process ,",
    "the system is in equilibrium ( diamagnetic state ) below the thermal hysteresis region .",
    "when @xmath75 is moderate ( 93k ) , partial relaxation of @xmath71 is observed in the cooling process , and a magnetic phase transition occurs at a temperature lower than @xmath100 .",
    "there , the saturated @xmath70 is less than the fully saturated @xmath110 because the saturated @xmath71 is less than 1 .",
    "our results reproduce the experimental results@xcite qualitatively , and thus we believe that the dynamics that we adopted here represents an important aspect of the real dynamics of pba .",
    "we have also investigated the dynamical properties in the temperature cycle under irradiation .",
    "a shift of the sigmoidal relaxation of @xmath71 to a higher temperature and a shift of thermal hysteresis to a lower temperature are observed , because the photoexcitation makes high spin state more stable .",
