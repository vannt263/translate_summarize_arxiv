    "sgr a east has frequently been interpreted as a supernova remnant due to its shell structure and non - thermal spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ; and see the more recent references in @xcite ) .",
    "some recent research , however , has suggested that the energetics , size , and elongated morphology ( @xmath11 arcmin or @xmath12 pc at @xmath13 kpc ) of sgr a east can not have been produced by a typical supernova @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the required energy to produce sgr a east to be more than @xmath14 ergs .",
    "modeling of the entire spectrum of sgr a east by @xcite , which fits very well with the observations of the non - thermal emission of sgr a east and egret @xmath15-ray sources , supports the energy estimate by @xcite .",
    "those authors concluded that a single supernova explosion could explain the existence of sgr a east only if it occurred within the cavity formed by the stellar wind from a progenitor star . in that scenario , however , the formation of the cavity takes too much time ( @xmath16 yr ) compared with the orbital period ( @xmath17 yr ) of matter circling around the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that a different kind of explosive event could create sgr a east .",
    "the energy required to make a huge shell such as sgr a east has been associated with a ` hypernova ' @xcite .",
    "@xcite hypothesize that sgr a east may be the remnant of a solar mass star tidally disrupted by a massive black hole .",
    "their model can naturally explain the elongated shape of sgr a east as well as the extreme energetics .",
    "however , from their observation with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , @xcite suggest that sgr a east should be classified as a metal - rich ` mixed morphology ' supernova remnant .",
    "they argue that the model of @xcite can not reproduce the metal - rich abundances observed at the centre of sgr a east .",
    "they also conclude that a single type ii supernova explosion with an energy of @xmath18 ergs into an homogeneous ambient medium with a density of @xmath19 can most simply explain the results of both radio and x - ray observations , and thus that the extreme energy of @xmath20 ergs is not required .    in principle",
    ", the energy of the explosive event can be directly measured by studying regions where sgr a east is colliding with ambient interstellar material . by tracing the dynamics of molecular gas , an interaction between the eastern part of sgr",
    "a east and the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) m-0.02 - 0.07 ( also known as the ` @xmath21 cloud ' ) has been inferred @xcite .",
    "recent observations of nh@xmath10(3,3 ) emission in the region show that sgr a east impacts material to the north and west as well ( see fig .  [ fig_target ] ) @xcite . as direct evidence of this interaction ,",
    "several 1720 mhz oh masers , which are a good diagnostic of the continuous , or c - type , shock excitation @xcite , have been detected along the southern edge of sgr a east and to the north of the circum - nuclear disc ( cnd ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite detected h@xmath2 line emission in regions where oh - masers have been detected .",
    "in most cases h@xmath2 line emission arises either from thermal excitation ( e.g. by shock heating ) or from non - thermal excitation by far - uv absorption @xcite .",
    "one can in principle distinguish between these two mechanisms by comparing near - infrared ( near - ir ) line intensities .",
    "the @xmath7 / @xmath8 ratio has been an effective discriminant in a number of shocked regions ( where the ratio should be @xmath22 ) and photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) ( where it is about 0.5  0.6 ) .",
    "however , a ` thermal ' line ratio can be observed in a pdr  even though fluorescence is the dominant excitation mechanism  if the gas density is high ( @xmath23 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite observed the cnd and concluded that the h@xmath2 molecules are excited by collisions , while the results for larger regions ( about @xmath24 deg@xmath25 ) by @xcite are consistent with non - thermal excitation .",
    "the interpretation of @xcite and @xcite that the line emission in sgr a east is thermal is supported by the presence of the 1720 mhz oh masers .",
    "it is therefore likely that sgr a east is indeed driving shocks into the adjacent gmcs to the south and into the cnd .",
    "the fields observed by @xcite and @xcite are restricted to the vicinity of the cnd and cover only some of the regions where interaction of the sgr a east shell with surrounding material is expected .",
    "before one can hope to estimate the energy released in the event that created sgr a east , it is necessary to observe additional interaction regions in diagnostic lines of h@xmath2 at high spectral resolution . in this paper",
    "we present velocity - resolved , near - ir h@xmath2 observations at the northeastern boundary of sgr a east . by measuring @xmath7 / @xmath8 line ratios and line profiles",
    "simultaneously we aim to study the excitation and kinematics of the interaction between sgr a east and m-0.02 - 0.07 .",
    "we observed the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 spectra at the 3.8 m united kingdom infra - red telescope ( ukirt ) in hawaii on 2001 august 3 and 4 ( ut ) , using the cooled grating spectrometer 4 ( cgs4 ; @xcite ) with a 31 l / mm echelle grating , 300 mm focal length camera optics and a two - pixel - wide slit .",
    "the spatial resolution along the slit was 0.90 arcsec for @xmath4 with the grating angle of 64691 and 0.84 arcsec for @xmath7 with 62127 , respectively ; the slit widths on the sky were 0.83 and 0.89 arcsec , respectively , for these two configurations .",
    "the slit length is @xmath9  90 arcsec .",
    "the instrumental resolutions , measured from gaussian fits to sky lines in our raw data , were @xmath28 for @xmath4 and @xmath29 for @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "ten parallel slit positions were observed , sampling a @xmath3 arcsec area on the northeastern boundary of sgr a east .",
    "the slit was oriented @xmath30 east of north for each measurement ; adjacent slit positions were separated by 3 arcsec perpendicular to the slit axis .",
    "the coordinates at the centre of the observed area are @xmath31 ( j2000 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_target ] ) . the southwestern part of this region includes the ` outer h@xmath2 clumps ' from which h@xmath2 emission was detected by @xcite",
    ". only the ninth slit position , hereafter called ` slit 9 ' , was observed in both @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "the telescope was nodded between object and blank sky positions every 25 minutes , to subtract the background and telluric oh line emission .",
    "the sky positions were offset by about 25 ( @xmath32 ) from the on - source positions .",
    "initial data reduction steps , involving bias - subtraction and flat - fielding ( using an internal blackbody lamp ) , were accomplished by the automated observatory reduction and acquisition control ( orac ) pipeline at ukirt .",
    "iraf was used for the remainder of the reduction .",
    "we corrected the spectral distortion along the dispersion axis using the spectrum of the standard star hr 6496 as a template .",
    "the sky oh lines were then used to correct for spatial distortion perpendicular to this axis and also for wavelength calibration .",
    "we also corrected for the motions of the earth and sun in order to determine local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocities .",
    "only part of the flux from a standard star is detected due to the narrow slit ; hence for proper flux calibration the measured signal must be corrected .",
    "we assumed a circularly symmetric psf for the star , based on the flux profile along the slit length , to estimate the missing flux .",
    "the correction factor , which varies with the seeing , ranged from 2.06 to 2.56 .",
    "near - ir emission from the galactic centre is attenuated by interstellar material in the foreground ( mostly 4  8 kpc from the galactic centre ) and by material in the galactic centre itself . since we believe that the h@xmath2 line emission originates from the surface of the cloud , we ignore the latter @xcite and correct only for foreground extinction ; which we assume to be @xmath33 mag @xcite .",
    "bright ( 1.6  21 @xmath5 ) h@xmath2 emission was detected from most of the observed region ( @xmath3 arcsec ) along the northeastern boundary of sgr a east .",
    "we created a se ",
    "nw cut parallel to the boundary of sgr a east ( ` cut b ' ) by extracting spectra from each of the ten slit positions .",
    "a second cut perpendicular to the boundary ( i.e. , sw  ne ) is composed of six positions from slit 9 .",
    "the positions of cut b and slit 9 are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig_target ] . along cut b",
    ", the intensity of nh@xmath10 emission varies dramatically ; we can investigate both high and low density regions along this cut .",
    "slit 9 is the only slit observed both in @xmath4 and @xmath34 , the line ratio of which we can use to constrain models for the excitation of h@xmath2 . in this paper , we present the results of these two cuts , rather than the whole data set , as a preliminary report .",
    "we aim to concentrate on the excitation mechanism of the detected h@xmath2 emission , and the map the structure and kinematics perpendicular to and parallel to the boundary . from the sixteen @xmath4 spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig_spect_bcut ] & [ fig_spect_nw12 ] we measure line centres and line widths along the interaction region .",
    "each spectrum is well fitted by one or two gaussian components .",
    "[ fig_param_bcut ] & [ fig_param_nw12 ] show the distributions of the derived @xmath4 line parameters along cut b and slit 9 , respectively . for direct comparison ,",
    "we include in these figures data from the nh@xmath10(3,3 ) observations of @xcite ; the nh@xmath10 emission essentially traces the cool ( @xmath35 k ) , dense ( @xmath36 ) , cloud material . from these data we note the following .    * in figs .",
    "[ fig_param_bcut](a ) & [ fig_param_nw12](a ) there are two velocity components , at @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "both components are evident in h@xmath2 and nh@xmath10 , although the 0 @xmath6 features are not spatially coincident . the variation in the velocity of either component is less than @xmath39 along both slit 9 and cut b. * the h@xmath2 line widths in figs .",
    "[ fig_param_bcut](b ) & [ fig_param_nw12](b ) are much broader than the nh@xmath10 widths and show no obvious trend along either slit 9 or cut b. * along cut b , the distribution of the total intensity of h@xmath2 ( the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig_param_bcut](c ) ) is quite different from the nh@xmath10 ( the dashed line ; the units are arbitrarily scaled ) .",
    "the nh@xmath10 emission increases to the southeast as the cut passes deeper into the body of the gmc m-0.02 - 0.07 , but the h@xmath2 emission decreases in this direction .",
    "the decrease in h@xmath2 may be explained either by exhaustion of the source of excitation ( e.g. shock energy or uv photons ) or by obscuration , at the inner , more dense , regions of the cloud , or by the geometry of the interaction region ( see section 3.3 ) . * along slit 9 , the distribution of the h@xmath2 intensity ( solid line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_param_nw12](c ) is generally similar to that of nh@xmath10 ( dashed line ) .",
    "it should be noted that nh@xmath10 is attenuated at positions greater than @xmath40 by the edge of the primary beam in the vla mosaic @xcite .",
    "there is a small discrepancy between nh@xmath10 and h@xmath2 between @xmath41 and @xmath40 which may be the result of the same effects discussed in cut b. note that slit 9 covers a very large spatial scale ( 90 arcsec ) .",
    "the brightest emission along slit 9 , between offsets @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( the southwestern part ) , arises from the outer h@xmath2 clumps of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 line was detected at three locations along slit 9 , at positions ne @xmath44 , sw @xmath45 , and sw @xmath46 relative to the centre of the slit ( @xmath47 ; j2000 ) . from these data we measured line ratios ( @xmath7 / @xmath8 ) of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_spect_nw12 ] ) . at other positions",
    "only the @xmath4 line was detected , with 3@xmath51 upper limits to the ratio of 0.5 , 0.6 , and 0.1 at offsets of ne @xmath52 , ne @xmath53 , and sw @xmath54 along slit 9 , respectively .",
    "fluorescent excitation in a low - density pdr ( @xmath55 ) should yield a ratio of about 0.6 .",
    "a lower ratio is expected in a more dense pdr environment @xcite , or in a shock .",
    "there are two basic types of shock ; ` jump ' or j - type and ` continuous ' or c - type ( see @xcite for a review ) . a j - type shock is formed in a highly ionized or weakly magnetized gas .",
    "fluid parameters such as density and temperature undergo a discontinuous change ( jump ) at the shock front where the molecules may be dissociated .",
    "j - type shocks ( with velocities greater than about 24 @xmath6 ) will completely dissociate the molecules @xcite ; h@xmath2 emission occurs from a warm , recombination plateau in the post - shock region .",
    "j - type shocks typically produce low line intensities and @xmath56 line ratios as large as 0.5 are possible @xcite . at lower shock velocities , below the h@xmath2 dissociation speed limit",
    ", j - type shocks may yield much lower line ratios ; @xmath57 @xcite . in a c - type shock , where the magnetic field softens the shock front via ion - magnetosonic wave propagation so that the fluid parameters change continuously across the shock front , the h@xmath2 dissociation speed limit is much higher ( @xmath9 45 @xmath6 ; depending on the density and magnetic field strength in the pre - shock gas )",
    ". smaller line ratios of about 0.2 are then predicted @xcite .    from the observed ratios",
    "alone we are not able to unambiguously distinguish between excitation mechanisms .",
    "our results can either be explained by fast j - type shocks or dense pdrs , or by a combination of fluorescence and either c - type shocks or slow j - type shocks , since the higher line ratios associated with fluorescence will be tempered by the low @xmath7 intensities associated with collisional excitation in shocks .    to help distinguish between the h@xmath2 excitation mechanisms , we consider kinematic information and the spatial variation of the line ratio along slit 9 . at most positions in figs .",
    "[ fig_param_bcut](b ) & [ fig_param_nw12](b ) , the h@xmath2 line widths are high ( typically 40  70 @xmath6 , but as high as 120 @xmath6 in some positions ) .",
    "this suggests shock excitation and turbulent motions in the gas and tends to exclude the pure fluorescence models ( in which the h@xmath2 line emission generally arises from the stationary gas at the edges of neutral clouds illuminated by far - uv photons from early - type stars ) .",
    "however , in other shocked regions the line ratio is found to be constant over a wide range of @xmath4 intensities and spatial positions @xcite , although this is not necessarily predicted from theory @xcite .",
    "conversely , in a pdr the ratio is sensitive to the incident fuv flux and the molecular gas density ( the @xmath4 intensity increases but the @xmath7 / @xmath8 ratio decreases with increasing gas density or uv intensity ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus an unchanging @xmath56 ratio is found in shocks , while a varying ratio is expected in the pure fluorescent case . the measured line ratio and the @xmath4 intensity in fig .",
    "[ fig_param_nw12](c ) , show evidence of an anti - correlation in our data , as expected in dense pdrs .",
    "although the wide line profiles point to shock excitation , fluorescence appears to play a significant role at at least some locations .",
    "considering the kinematics further , we note that j - type shocks produce narrow lines that peak at the velocity of the shock , while c - type shocks produce broader lines which peak at the velocity of the pre - shock gas and extend up to the shock velocity . figs .",
    "[ fig_param_bcut](a ) & [ fig_param_nw12](a ) show that there are two velocity components that are similar in h@xmath2 and nh@xmath10 .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission traces hot ( @xmath58 k ) gas and the nh@xmath10 cool ( @xmath59 k ) gas .",
    "thus , if we assume that shocks are driven by sgr a east into cold molecular gas , whose velocities are given by the nh@xmath10 data , then fast j - type shocks are inconsistent with our results , due to the low peak velocities of the h@xmath2 lines relative to the molecular clouds .    in summary , then , the wide line profiles and low peak velocities indicate c - type shock excitation .",
    "however , the high values of the line ratio at some positions along slit 9 and the spatial variation in that ratio , point to a fluorescent component to the excitation in some locations . a combination of c - type shocks and fluorescence ( see e.g. @xcite ) is therefore the most reasonable explanation for the h@xmath2 excitation . for the fluorescence",
    ", the source of the uv radiation could be either nearby early type stars or j - type shocks .",
    "however , as noted above , we see no evidence of j - type shocks in our data .",
    "also , we can not establish whether nearby stars are the source of the uv flux due to the lack of information on where or how many early type stars there are in the region .",
    "the extended + 50 @xmath6 component of the nh@xmath10 emission traces the gmc m-0.02 - 0.07 , while the 0 @xmath6 component corresponds to the ` northern ridge ' of @xcite ( see the nh@xmath10(3,3 ) channel maps in their fig .",
    "the nh@xmath10 component at @xmath9 + 20 @xmath6 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_param_nw12](a ) at negative offsets seems to trace hotter gas according to the nh@xmath10(2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) line ratio map by @xcite , which they suggest may be the result of an impact by sgr a east .",
    "the difference in line width between nh@xmath10 and h@xmath2 as well as the different spatial locations of their 0 @xmath6 features ( fig .",
    "[ fig_param_nw12](a ) ) indicate that the nh@xmath10 and h@xmath2 trace fundamentally different components of the gas .",
    "the narrow nh@xmath10 line widths arise in ambient clouds .",
    "the broader h@xmath2 line emission traces shocked gas where the nh@xmath10 molecules are likely destroyed .",
    "one can envision a situation in which sgr a east is located adjacent to both m-0.02 - 0.07 ( the + 50 @xmath6 component ) and the northern ridge ( the 0 @xmath6 component ) , with sgr a east driving c - type shocks into these clouds .    on the other hand , the fact that the two h@xmath2 velocity components overlap along the line - of - sight , yet are roughly equally bright seems somewhat unlikely , as one must be attenuated by the molecular cloud associated with the other .",
    "the rough equality might be explained by clumpiness of the foreground cloud , regardless of which one is in the foreground , where a small filling factor of high density clumps are embedded within a less dense medium @xcite .",
    "the size of such clumps seems to be @xmath60 ",
    "@xmath61 pc @xcite , which is smaller than our resolution of @xmath9 1 arcsec ( @xmath62 pc at the distance of @xmath9 8.5 kpc to the galactic center ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_structure ] , this clumpy structure could explain both the observed decrease of nh@xmath10 line emission and the observed increase of h@xmath2 line emission toward the edge of the cloud ( see the + 50 @xmath6 components in figs .",
    "[ fig_param_bcut](c ) & [ fig_param_nw12](c ) ) .",
    "we observed the northeastern part of the sgr a east shell in order to investigate its interaction with the gmc m-0.02 - 0.07 .",
    "the bright @xmath4 emission is strong evidence that sgr a east is physically adjacent to , and interacting with , m-0.02 - 0.07 .    by comparing the relative intensities of @xmath4 and @xmath7 emission",
    ", the distribution of the @xmath7 / @xmath8 line ratio , and the radial velocities of the h@xmath2 emission , we can to some extent distinguish between excitation mechanisms for the h@xmath2 .",
    "the line ratios tend to support emission in either fast j - type shocks or a dense pdr . however , on considering the bright @xmath4 intensity , the large line widths , and the spatial variation in the line ratio , we conclude that a combination of c - type shocks and fluorescence is required .",
    "the presence of shocks is direct evidence that sgr a east is driving into the surrounding material , and is consistent with the detection of 1720 mhz oh masers to the north of the cnd and to the south of sgr a east @xcite .",
    "very recently @xcite detected the 1720 mhz oh masers also at two positions near our target region , which is more direct evidence supporting our conclusion on the c - type shocks .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission covers most parts of our targeted region ( @xmath63 arcsec ) .",
    "the line profiles are made up of two velocity components both of which extend over a significant portion of the region ( @xmath64 arcsec ) .",
    "we find that the nh@xmath10(3,3 ) emission lines observed by @xcite also show a similar kinematic structure , with almost the same velocities .",
    "we suggest that the h@xmath2 line emission arises at the interfaces between sgr a east and two independent molecular clouds , with line - of - sight velocities of @xmath9 + 50 @xmath6 ( m-0.02 - 0.07 ) and @xmath9 0 @xmath6 ( the northern ridge ) .",
    "both the observed two velocity components of the h@xmath2 emission and the difference in the intensity distributions between the h@xmath2 and nh@xmath10 emission can be understood if the molecular clouds are composed of small dense clumps with a very small filling factor .    to study the origin and evolution of sgr a east , it would be important to know the total h@xmath2 luminosity and the total cooling rate ( based on that ) over the interaction region , which could be compared with those of well studied snrs",
    ". however , it is very difficult to estimate them with the small amount of information we have at present . given the uncertainty in the emission mechanisms , even estimating the total h@xmath2 luminosity in the small mapped region would be difficult , without considering the entire interaction region .",
    "it would be premature for us to estimate the required energy to make the sgr a east shell",
    ". we will be able to do this in the future , after observations of more of the interaction region .",

    "<S> we have detected the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines of h@xmath2 in the galactic centre , in a @xmath3 arcsec region between the northeastern boundary of the non - thermal source , sgr a east , and the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) m-0.02 - 0.07 . </S>",
    "<S> the detected @xmath4 emission has an intensity of 1.6  21 @xmath5 and is present over most of the region . </S>",
    "<S> along with the high intensity , the broad line widths ( fwhm = 40  70 @xmath6 ) and the @xmath7 to @xmath8 line ratios ( 0.3  0.5 ) can be best explained by a combination of c - type shocks and fluorescence . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of shocked h@xmath2 is clear evidence that sgr a east is driving material into the surrounding adjacent cool molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath2 emission lines have two velocity components at @xmath9 + 50 @xmath6 and @xmath9 0 @xmath6 , which are also present in the nh@xmath10(3,3 ) emission mapped by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this two - velocity structure can be explained if sgr a east is driving c - type shocks into both the gmc m-0.02 - 0.07 and the northern ridge of @xcite .    </S>",
