    "the discovery by @xcite of an emission feature near 11.2@xmath0 m in spectra of planetary nebulae opened a new era in the study of interstellar matter .",
    "it is now recognised as one of the strongest of the ` unidentified infrared ' ( uir ) or ` aromatic infrared ' ( aib ) bands that lie between 3 and 20@xmath0 m and which are generally attributed to vibrational transitions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( for a review see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , in no case has it proved possible to identify a specific pah molecule .",
    "this is unfortunate because knowledge of pah shape , size distribution and degree of hydrogenation and/or ionisation would allow much greater exploitation of the spectra as probes of astrophysical conditions and processes .",
    "the advent of infrared ( ir ) satellites including iso , spitzer @xcite and akari @xcite has revealed the richness of the aib spectrum and also significant differences in the profiles of individual bands ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "interpretation of these variations in terms of the physical and chemical properties of pahs and the astronomical objects in which they are found could assist in the identification of pah sub - groups , and thus narrow down the number of possible pahs as carriers of aibs .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the 11.2 @xmath0 m feature , which is one of the most distinctive bands in the aib spectrum .",
    "it has been assigned to the c - h out - of - plane ( oop ) bending mode of solo - containing neutral pahs @xcite , although their precise molecular shapes and size distribution has not been established .",
    "weaker emission features around 11.0  @xmath0 m are generally attributed to the same type of transition in pah cations @xcite .",
    "we present here an emission model based on density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of vibrational transitions and intensities for a set of pah molecules .",
    "the model considers the emission process following optical / uv excitation using the relevant stellar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and includes the temperature dependence of the emission wavelength ( band position ) as the pah molecule cools through emission of ir photons .",
    "the results are used to explore the variation of the 11.2@xmath0 m profile in a range of astronomical objects with particular reference to the influence of the pah mass distribution .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec : char ] the characteristics of the 11.2@xmath0 m band are reviewed .",
    "the theoretical approach and the results of a series of dft calculations are presented in section[sec : calc ] and the emission model is described in section[sec : model ] .",
    "sections[sec : res ] and [ sec : dis ] contain the results and discussion of their astrophysical implications . a possible contribution from acenes to the 11.0@xmath0 m feature in the red rectangle",
    "is also discussed .",
    "the 11.2@xmath0 m feature has an asymmetric shape with a steep blue side and an extended red tail @xcite . following analysis of iso observations of objects in the galaxy , @xcite proposed two classes of 11.2@xmath0 m sources ( * a@xmath1 * and * b@xmath1 * ) and introduced a description using a _ tail - to - top _ ratio , _",
    "i.e. _ the strength of the red wing relative to the peak intensity of the overall profile with maximum near 11.2@xmath0 m .",
    "@xcite introduced a third class , * c@xmath1*. the class characteristics , illustrated with examples in fig . 1 , are :    * a@xmath1 * : :    - the most common , with a peak wavelength ranging between 11.20 and    11.24@xmath0 m and a relatively short red tail .",
    "sources    belonging to this class have a low value of _ tail - to - top _ ratio and    comprise various types of interstellar matter - reflection nebulae ,    h@xmath2 regions and the general interstellar    medium . * b@xmath1 * : :    - less common , with a peak wavelength of 11.25 @xmath0 m    and a long tail .",
    "objects in this class , such as the red rectangle    ( hd  44179 ) , have a high value of _ tail - to - top _ ratio and are usually    associated with circumstellar matter .",
    "* c@xmath1 * : :    - only a few examples , with peak wavelength ranging between 11.35 and    11.40@xmath0 m and an approximately symmetric shape .",
    "bands    belonging to this class are found in carbon - rich objects .",
    "some objects ( mostly planetary nebulae ) are classified as class * a(b)@xmath1 * and have a mixture of the characteristics of the a and b classes , with a peak wavelength of class a@xmath1 and a _ tail - to - top _ ratio of class b@xmath1 objects ( see for example bd+30@xmath3 3639 in fig.[11.2_cl ] ) .",
    "also , within the single reflection nebula ngc  7023 , variation in the 11.2@xmath0 m spectra from type a to a(b ) has been found @xcite .",
    "the a / b - type classification has also been applied to other spectral features in the 3@xmath0 m and 6 - 9@xmath0 m regions .",
    "based on a study of mid - ir _ spitzer _ spectra of carbon - rich post - agb stars in the lmc , @xcite have introduced separate classifications for the 6 - 9@xmath0 m and 10 - 14@xmath0 m regions , where the spectra for the latter region are classified as @xmath4 and @xmath5 . as the spectra we consider here are high - resolution data from iso - sws @xcite , we have elected to use the * a@xmath1 * , * b@xmath1 * and * a(b)@xmath1 * classification of @xcite .",
    "interpretation of the shape and the variation in the profile of the 11.2@xmath0 m band is a significant challenge which requires an explanation of ( a ) the steep short - wavelength side , ( b ) the variable peak wavelength and ( c ) the extension to longer wavelength . considering these in turn :    \\(a ) the wavelength at half peak intensity ( @xmath6 ) on the short - wavelength side of the 11.2@xmath7 m feature in 16 spectra of class a@xmath1 sources is almost invariant , which we determine to be 11.171  ( 2@xmath8  =  0.002)@xmath7 m ; the origin of this striking property is not understood .",
    "if the short - wavelength edge is considered to be part of a lorentzian profile this would correspond to a fwhm of only _ c. _",
    "4  @xmath9 which is narrow compared with other uir bands .",
    "\\(b ) the peak wavelength of the 11.2@xmath0 m feature has been found to depend on the effective temperature , t@xmath10 , of the exciting star @xcite .",
    "[ 11.2_temp ] collects together data from various authors .",
    "the peak wavelength of the 11.2  @xmath11 m band is independent of temperature for class a@xmath1 objects ( squares ) , but starting from class b@xmath1 ( triangle - the red rectangle ) it shifts to longer wavelength with decrease in stellar temperature .",
    "this change has been interpreted in terms of relatively newly formed material near to low temperature carbon - rich or herbig ae / be stars ( class c@xmath1 ) compared with older processed material in the higher temperature environments of planetary nebulae and hii regions @xcite .",
    "\\(c ) @xcite suggested that the long red tail of the 11.2@xmath0 m band may be due to superimposed transitions between higher vibrational levels such as v  =  2  @xmath12  1 . in the absence of laboratory data",
    "this contribution was incorporated assuming that the v  =  2  @xmath12  1 band falls at an arbitrarily chosen wavenumber 5  @xmath9 lower than for the fundamental transition .",
    "more recently , @xcite noted that while a feature of class a(b)@xmath1 could be considered as coming from the same pah population distribution as that which gives rise to class a@xmath1  but with higher internal energy , they commented that the difference between the a@xmath1 and b@xmath1 classes could not readily be explained by anharmonic effects alone .",
    "a contribution to emission in the red tail could potentially come from duo - hs of compact pah cations @xcite , c  h oop transitions in pah anions @xcite or from protonated pahs @xcite .",
    "in addition @xcite have discussed the possible role of @xmath13c isotopic substitution .",

    "the shapes of the aibs have been modelled @xcite ; the most detailed study of the 11.2@xmath7 m band is that of @xcite and includes both intermode anharmonicity ( which from laboratory measurements of @xcite allows the effect of cooling on emission wavelength and linewidth to be estimated ) , and intramode anharmonicity which is a contribution from vibrational transitions of the type @xmath14  @xmath12  @xmath15 with @xmath14  @xmath16",
    "a mass distribution for the pahs was included of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of carbon atoms .",
    "this affects the response of the pahs to optical excitation and their subsequent cooling .",
    "however , in considering molecular diversity , it was assumed that all pahs contributing to the 11.2@xmath7 m band profile had exactly the same infrared active mode frequency .",
    "it was deduced that the asymmetric profile appeared to be characteristic of the anharmonicity of molecular modes , and that including a spread of frequencies according to molecular size and geometry would lead to a change in overall band shape and consequent difficulty in achieving a good fit to the observed band .",
    "this contrasts with the work reported here where we find that the dependence of the vibrational transition frequencies on the masses of the 11.2@xmath7 m carriers and their relative abundance are key factors in determining the overall 11.2@xmath7 m band profile and its variation between objects .",

    "two closely related models were developed .      in the first application of the above approach ( short - dashed line in fig.[em_mod ] ) , the experimentally - based temperature - dependence for the band frequency and width ( eq .  1 . and 2 .",
    "respectively - see section 4.2 ) for ovalene were taken to hold for the larger molecules in the set ( _ i.e. _ independent of pah mass ) .",
    "however , as each molecule has a different initial peak temperature ( determined by the stellar sed ) and a different vibrational solo - oop frequency according to molecular size , the cooling cascade and resultant emission profile necessarily differs in each case .",
    "a @xmath90 minimisation was undertaken with the only variable being the relative adundance of the four pahs .",
    "this model provides a reasonable match with the peak wavelength and long - wavelength tails of the bands , but it does not account very well for the steep short - wavelength side seen in many astronomical spectra including orion  h2s1 and ngc  7027 .",
    "this discrepancy falls in the part of the profile where high - mass pahs are expected to contribute most strongly and lies near to the asymptotic limit discussed in section  [ sec : res disc ] .",
    "+ considering the experimental observations for the widths of the infrared active c  h stretch transitions in naphthalene , pyrene and coronene ( equation2 ) , then for a given temperature the width of the band is found to decrease with increase in pah mass ( see tab.2 and fig.4 in * ? ? ?",

    "additionally , as higher mass pahs do not reach as high an internal temperature  for the same exciting sed , high - mass pahs have narrower absorption ( and emission ) band widths than their lower mass counterparts .",

    "this fwhm represents the upper limit on the width of a single contribution to the shorter wavelength side of the 11.2@xmath0 m band .",
    "a similar value has been suggested by @xcite .",

    "there are many questions as to the origin(s ) of feature(s ) in the 11.0  @xmath11 m region .",
    "it was inferred earlier that the red rectangle has a population of lower - mass pahs than for orion  h2s1 and ngc  7027 ( section  [ sec : massdistbn ] ) , so it is of interest to explore whether low - mass pahs including acenes might contribute to the 11.0@xmath0 m region in this object .",

    "the ir vibrational spectrum of neutral , long acenes is dominated by strong c - h oop modes ( solo and quarto ) @xcite .",
