    "recent transport experiments @xcite have established that the resistivity of a two - dimensional electron system with weak disorder and valence orbital landau level filling @xmath4 close to @xmath5 is anisotropic when the valence orbital landau level index @xmath6 .",
    "apparently the ground state spontaneously breaks orientational symmetry , a property believed to be associated with the uni - directional charge - density - wave ground states predicted @xcite in this regime by hartree - fock mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) state consists of electron stripes of width @xmath7 with local landau level filling factor @xmath8 , separated by hole stripes of width @xmath9 with local filling factor @xmath10 .",
    "here @xmath11 , the cdw period , is comparable to the landau level s cyclotron orbit diameter . because of symmetry properties shared with the smectic state of classical liquid crystals , emphasized by fradkin and kivelson @xcite , these states",
    "have been referred to as quantum hall smectics , a practice we follow here .",
    "the most important transport property of quantum hall smectics is that dissipation occurs over a wide range of filling factors surrounding @xmath12 and is not activated at low temperatures .",
    "this behavior is _ not _ consistent with the properties of a cdw state , which would be pinned by the random disorder potential and have a large gap for mobile quasiparticle excitations , and suggests that , although hartree - fock theory hints at the energetic motivation for a ground state with broken orientational symmetry , the description which it provides of the ground state is flawed .",
    "several recent theoretical papers @xcite have addressed the properties of quantum hall smectics and the energetic competition between cdw states , compressible composite - fermion states , and paired incompressible quantum hall states .",
    "in one recent paper @xcite we have described a theory of quantum hall smectics which starts from the hartree - fock theory ground state , recognizes the electron stripes as coupled one - dimensional electron systems , and treats residual interaction and disorder terms neglected by hartree - fock theory using the convenient bosonization techniques of one - dimensional electron physics .",
    "the most important conclusions of this work are the following : i ) the quantum hall smectic state is _ never _ the ground state but instead is always unstable , for @xmath4 close to @xmath5 likely to an anisotropic electron wigner crystal state ; ii ) for @xmath13 the interaction terms responsible for the wigner crystal can be neglected at temperatures available in a dilution fridge ; and iii ) weak disorder which scatters electrons from stripe to stripe , enabling hard - direction transport , leads to non - linear transport . in this article",
    "we emphasize and expand on an experimentally important prediction of this work , namely that the strength of the transport non - linearity is sensitive to the nature of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "in particular we predict that the transport non - linearity can be enhanced by placing a screening plane close to the two - dimensional electron system .",
    "in section ii we explain our theory of transport in quantum hall smectics and discuss how the coefficients which govern the power - law behavior of the differential resistivity for weak disorder are related to correlations in the coupled one - dimensional electron stripes . in section iii we briefly review our theory of these correlations and explain why long - range electron - electron interactions weaken transport non - linearities . in section",
    "iv we present numerical results for the non - linear transport coefficients for a model in which interactions in the two - dimensional electron layer are screened by a metallic layer co - planar with the electron system but separated from it by a distance @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude in section v with a brief summary .",
    "our transport theory @xcite is built on a semiclassical boltzmann - like approach ; microscopic physics enters only in the calculation of scattering rates . we choose a coordinate system where the @xmath14 ( horizontal ) direction runs along the stripes which are separated in the @xmath15 ( vertical ) direction .",
    "we assume that the charge density wave itself is pinned and immobilized by both the edges of the sample and weak impurities which couple to the electrons within the stripes . in this case ,",
    "collective sliding motion of the charge - density will be absent , and electrical transport will be dominated by single - electron scattering across and between electron stripes .",
    "an important property of electronic states in the quantum hall regime , is the spatial separation of states which carry current in opposite directions . in the case of the electron stripes in quantum hall smectics ,",
    "the fermi edge states which carry oppositely directed currents along the stripes ( left - going and right - going ) are located on opposite sides of the stripe .",
    "translational invariance along the @xmath14 direction , allows us to use a landau gauge where this component of wavevector @xmath16 is a good quantum number in the absence of interactions and disorder .",
    "the single - particle states at the stripe edges have velocity magnitude @xmath17 , the fermi velocity . in the landau gauge , @xmath14 direction momenta",
    "are related to @xmath15 direction positions by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnetic length , so that states on opposite sides of the same stripe differ in momenta by a @xmath20 and the adjacent sides of neighboring stripes differ in momenta by @xmath21 .",
    "we now summarize the basic assumptions on which our semiclassical transport theory is based and quote the expressions implied by these assumptions .",
    "for further details see ref .",
    "we assume that in the steady state , each edge of each stripe is characterized by a local chemical potential .",
    "translational invariance in the @xmath15 direction implies that the chemical potential drops across each stripe and between any two adjacent stripes are the same ,",
    "mf @xmath22 is the chemical potential drop across an electron stripe , it follows that the potential drop between stripes is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the hard - direction electric field , the field which supports a steady state transport across the stripes .",
    "the electric field in the @xmath14 direction produces a semiclassical drift in momentum space which drives the system from equilibrium .",
    "we assume that disorder scattering across and between stripes , then attempts to reestablish equilibrium and that the drift and scattering processes are in balance in the steady state .",
    "the scattering currents in the hard - direction are characterized by relaxation times @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the current along a stripe is analogous to the quantized current in a long narrow hall bar and is proportional to the chemical potential difference across that stripe .",
    "combining these ingredients leads @xcite to the following expressions for the resistivities : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath12 , this theory makes a parameter free prediction for the product @xmath31 which has been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "in fact , as emphasized @xcite by van oppen _ et al .",
    "_ , this feature of our results has a greater validity than would be suggested by our assumption of largely intact electron stripes .",
    "our main interest here however , is in expanding on our predictions @xcite for non - linearities in the easy and hard direction differential resistivities .",
    "these predictions were made on the basis of a simple lowest order renormalization group scheme for handling the infrared divergence which appear when disorder terms which scatter electrons either across or between stripes are treated perturbatively .",
    "this analysis leads to @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are golden - rule scattering rates at the characteristic microscopic energy scale @xmath35 , here @xmath36 is @xcite the scaling dimension of the operator which scatters an electron across a stripe , which we discuss in the next section , and @xmath37 is the scaling dimension of the operator which scatters an electron between neighboring stripes .",
    "the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 depend on correlations induced by electron - electron interaction between stripes , and are sensitive in particular to the range of the microscopic electron - electron interaction . at @xmath38 , the case on which we will concentrate , @xmath39 .    given these expressions",
    ", it follows @xcite that the non - linear differential resistivity in the hard direction @xmath40 with an exponent @xmath41 .",
    "similar considerations apply for the easy direction current : @xmath42 with an exponent @xmath43 . in the next section",
    "we show that both @xmath44 and @xmath45 increase when the distance to the screening plane is comparable to or smaller than the cdw period .",
    "the cdw state of hartree - fock theory @xcite is a single - slater - determinant . in the valence landau level",
    ", groups of landau - gauge single - particle states with adjacent @xmath46 ( adjacent @xmath15 ) are occupied to form stripes and separated by groups which are unoccupied .",
    "small fluctuations in the positions and shapes of the stripes can be described in terms of particle - hole excitations near the stripe edges .",
    "the residual electron - electron interaction terms which scatter into these low energy states are ignored in hartree - fock theory and fall into two classes :  forward \" scattering interactions which conserve the number of electrons on each edge of every stripe , and",
    " backward \" scattering processes which do not .",
    "the latter processes involve large momentum transfer and are unimportant @xcite at accessible temperatures for @xmath4 near @xmath5 .",
    "the quantum smectic model @xcite , briefly described in this section includes forward scattering only .",
    "the interactions are bilinear in the 1d electron density contributions from a particular edge of a particular stripe : @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "since the density of a single filled landau level is @xmath49 , the displacement of an edge is related to its associated charge density contribution by @xmath50 .",
    "the quadratic hamiltonian which describes the _ classical _ energetics for small fluctuations has the following general form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 . here",

    "it will be important for our present interest that the hamiltonian must be invariant under : @xmath64 . for short - range interactions",
    "this implies that at long wavelengths @xmath65 characteristic of classical smectic elasticity . as we will discuss , this conclusion must be modified in the case of long - range interactions .",
    "a _ quantum _ theory of the quantum - hall smectic @xcite is obtained by imposing kac - moody commutation relations on the chiral densities : @xmath66 = \\frac{i}{2\\pi } \\alpha \\delta_{\\alpha,\\beta } \\delta_{n , n ' } \\partial_{x } \\delta(x - x').\\ ] ] together with eq .",
