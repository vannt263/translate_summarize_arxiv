    "alumina is non - magnetic while chromia is antiferromagnetic .",

    "the combination of grain boundaries of different planes through this bulk spin structure can make predicting the preferred spin state difficult .",
    "therefore , several spin states were tried for each interface with the most energetically preferred spin state used for grain boundary .",
    "all the spin states used can be arranged into three groups .",
    "the first group is where the spin structures are aligned as if they were within a continuous bulk structure .",
    "two examples of this are seen for the prismatic gb with screw symmetry in figure [ img : pris]b and the cr terminated pyramidal gb with glide symmetry shown in figure [ img : pyra]a",
    ". however , due to the symmetry of the interfaces , this is often not a reasonable spin configuration .",
    "this leads to the second type of spin state where the spins at the interface are the inverse of spins expected in the next row of a single grain .",
    "this will be referred to as the two grains being anti - aligned with each other .",
    "the rhombohedral gb with vacancy terminated screw symmetry is an example of anti - aligned spin states as seen in figure [ img : rhom]c .",
    "the final spin state is shown in figure [ img : basal]a , where the basal gb with rotational symmetry has a horizontally shifted spin state between the two grains that is neither aligned nor anti - aligned .",
    "it can be seen that the spin orientation for the basal gb has been shifted by one cr atom in the [ @xmath16010 ] direction in relation to what would exist for a spin aligned system like that seen for the prismatic screw gb .",
    "to aid in the understand of the energy ordering among the various gb planes we first discuss the structural details , the changes in the electronic density of states , dos , of all the gb interfaces of cr@xmath0o@xmath1 , and compare the energetic stability among them .      for the rhombohedral systems the energy ordering of the three symmetry / interfacial systems can be described based upon an analysis of the bond distances between the cr - o bonds , cr - cr spacing , and o - o spacing in the first layers from the interface .",
    "this is because all three of the systems considered for the rhombohedral gb ( the o terminated interface with glide symmetry rg(o ) , the cr vacancy terminated interface with glide symmetry rg(v ) , and the cr vacancy terminated screw symmetry rs(v ) ) have anti - aligned spins at the interface .",
    "it causes the magnetic effects to only amplify the energy ordering resulting from the strained bond distances .",
    "starting with the least energetically favorable rhombohedral interface , rg(v ) , two features of the interfacial structure can be seen that affect the interfacial energy of the system .",
    "first , the spacing between o atoms on either side of the interface is 2.24 @xmath25 , which is @xmath26 0.4 @xmath25 shorter than the smallest spacing seen in the bulk ( 2.66 @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is after an expansion of around 2% in the [ @xmath27 direction during the optimization demonstrating the strain at this interface .",
    "in addition there is a large number of strained cr - o bonds ( both compressed and stretched ) at the interface with 2/3 of the bonds for each cr atom at the interface strained by @xmath260.1 @xmath25 .",
    "this is followed energetically by the rg(o ) rhombohedral system , which contains reasonable o - o separation but has a large strain in the cr - o bonds in the first couple of atomic layers of the interface .",
    "each cr at the interface has 2/3 of its bonds strained by between 0.1 and 0.2 @xmath25 , which corresponds to a 5 - 10% strain in the bond .",
    "finally , the most energetically favorable rhombohedral system is the rs(v ) system , which has a reasonable o - o bond and a lesser strain in the cr - o interfacial bonds than the rg(o ) system with a single bond ( 1/6 ) for each interfacial cr stretched by 0.1 @xmath25 .",
    "this energy ordering and the corresponding analysis matches with marinopoulos _ et al . _ @xcite who observed the same energy ordering for al@xmath0o@xmath1 due to o spacing .",
    "they also see more strained bonding in the rg(v ) and rg(o ) systems compared to the rs(v ) .",
    "this is shown within the density of states , dos , in figure [ img : dosrglidev]-[img : dosrglideo ] where the rg(v ) and rg(o ) systems both get significant changes in shape of the deep @xmath28 electrons and create spin polarized states composed of the @xmath29 and @xmath3 orbitals directly below the fermi energy .",
    "there is no major change of the dos of rs(v ) ( figure [ img : dosrscrewv ] ) main over the same energies ) , which results in the low energy for the rs(v ) gb .",
    "the basal gb plane is particularly interesting because of the close structural relationship between the mirror , bm(o ) , and glide - mirror , bg(o ) , systems .",
    "it is important to note that the bg(o ) system during unconstrained optimization shifted to the bm(o ) symmetry .",
    "however , we felt that the bulk portion of each grain would prevent this shift in physical systems .",
    "therefore , several layers in the `` bulk '' of each grain were constrained to the locations of the idealized symmetrical grain boundary .",
    "this resulted in a gradual shift in atomic position between the two bulk regions with the atoms at the interface resembling the bm(o ) interface as shown in figure [ img : basal]b - c . since the bg(o ) and the bm(o )",
    "interfaces are similar , it is the constraint of fixing the bulk regions of the bg(o ) that shifts this system to slightly higher energies .",
    "the difference in energy between the bm(o ) interface and the br(cr ) interface can be explained by the same structuring as seen by the al@xmath0o@xmath1 basal interface  @xcite .",
    "the bulk corundum structure as shown in figure [ img : planes ] has a stacking of cations parallel to the [ 0001 ] direction of the form void - cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-void ( two vertical sets offset by a single step ) with a spacing of 2.72 @xmath25 between cr sites .",
    "however , for the basal gbs this stacking is changed . in the br(cr )",
    "interface shown in figure [ img : basal]a the two stacks change to one stack being void - cr(@xmath30)-void with the other becoming void - cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-cr(@xmath31)-void with spacing between cr of 2.58 @xmath25 and 2.63 @xmath25 ( between similar spins ) . for the bm(o )",
    "interface shown in figure [ img : basal]b the first stack stays the same i.e. void - cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-void with cr spacing of 2.75 @xmath25 , while the second stack becomes void - cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-void with cr spacing of 2.63 @xmath25 , 2.46 @xmath25 , and 2.63 @xmath25 . when the difference between the cr spacing in each stack is compared we see that the bond distances are similar except for the addition of the 2.46 @xmath25 for the bm(o ) interface .",
    "this addition compression of 0.15 @xmath25 ( effectively doubling the other distances ) is expected to be the cause of the increase in e@xmath32 for bm(o ) in comparison to the br(cr ) even with the two same spin neighbors in the br(cr ) system .",
    "the dos of the basal plane gbs for figure [ img : dosbglide ] - [ img : dosbrot ] supports this analysis with the bands beneath the fermi energies of the bm(o ) and bg(o ) systems shifting position by around an ev while the br(cr ) system shifts band shape with a slight increase in energy with the band just below the fermi energy being spin polarized .",
    "this large shift in the band positions with respect to the br(cr ) corresponds to the higher energy of the bm(o ) and bg(o ) systems .",
    "both prismatic gb planes are terminated in cr - o planes . for the glide plane interface , prg ,",
    "the interface plane is in - between two cr - o planes parallel to the [ 0001 ] direction , while for the screw plane interface , prs , the interface is at a cr - o plane .",
    "the biggest difference between the bulk and either the prg or the prs interfaces is the distribution of the cr atoms within the o anion lattice . in the bulk",
    "the cr cations are distributed in a single plane in the ( 1010 ) direction in pairs of the form void - cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-void with each plane offset by one place ( i.e. the next plane has the distribution of cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-void - cr(@xmath30 ) ) .",
    "the intra - cr spacing distance for the bulk is 2.959 @xmath25 with the two cr offset slightly in the ( 0001 ) direction .",
    "for both the prg and the prs gbs , aside from minor changes in the o positions due to geometry optimization , the interface occurs where this distribution of cr atoms has changed as shown in figure [ img : pris ] . in the prg system",
    "the abc plane distribution of the cr atoms at the interface has planes of a=(void - void ) , b=(void - cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-void ) , and c=(void - cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-void ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the middle two cr atoms in both the b and c planes are not shifted in the ( 0001 ) direction .",
    "this also increases the number of neighboring in - plane cr atoms from 1 ( for bulk ) to 2 and 3 for the c plane interface cations .",
    "both of these effects are expected to raise the energy of the interface .",
    "the prs interface also has an abc plane distribution .",
    "however , for prs the values are a = ( void - cr(@xmath30)-void ) , b = ( void - cr(@xmath30)-cr(@xmath31)-cr(@xmath30)-void ) , and c = ( void ) . for the b plane",
    "the middle cr atom has 2 in - plane cr neighbors , which causes a smaller increase in the interface energy than for the prg interface .",
    "therefore , the prs interface is the most energetically preferred prismatic twin grain boundary .",
    "this agrees with the al@xmath0o@xmath1 prismatic gbs as described by fabris _",
    "_ @xcite the dos in figure [ img : dospriss ] and [ img : dosprisg ] for these two systems show a large deviation from the bulk regions of each interface with new states generated above both the @xmath28 and @xmath29/@xmath3 clusters of states .",
    "these are due to the additional cr neighbors due to the modified stacking order .",
    "like the other gb planes the pyramidal gb planes were selected from those considered in the al@xmath0o@xmath1 literature  @xcite .",
    "this resulted in two glide symmetry systems , one with cr termination , pyg(cr ) , and one with o termination , pyg(o ) .",
    "however , when these two structures were constructed for cr@xmath0o@xmath1 the pyg(o ) system shifted the first atomic layers upon optimization to become the pyg(cr ) interface .",
    "it can therefore be concluded that unlike the al@xmath0o@xmath1 structure pyg(o ) is not stable in cr@xmath0o@xmath1 . during the optimization of the pyg(o )",
    "system a quasi - stable system arose that resembled the al@xmath0o@xmath1 pyg(o ) system .",
    "this cr@xmath0o@xmath1 system has a spacing of 2.51 @xmath25 between interfacial cr , compared to the 2.72 @xmath25 in bulk , and an inter - o spacing of 2.02 @xmath25 compared to the 2.66 @xmath25 minimum distance between o atoms in the bulk .",
    "these highly strained inter - cr and inter - o spacing is the cause of the pyg(o ) interface shifting to the pyg(cr ) interface .",
    "however , this is not strongly portrayed in the dos as shown in figure [ img : dospyras ] and [ img : dospyrag ] where the dos do not significantly change in relation to the bulk structures .      using [ eqn : eint ] to calculate the interfacial energy allows for comparison among the interfaces .",
    "particularly , it allows for the comparison of the energies of the surface bonding and interface splitting that would be major determining factors in which interfaces exist at grain boundaries .",
    "as can be seen in table [ tab : gbenergy2 ] the six most energetically favorable interfaces are the prs @xmath33 rs(v ) @xmath33 prg @xmath33 br(cr ) @xmath33 rg(o ) @xmath33 pyg(cr ) .",
    "this is consistent with the calculations of fang _",
    "@xcite , which has the prismatic interface energy being at lower energy than either the cr or o terminated basal interfaces . for the cr@xmath0o@xmath1 gbs two of the first three most favorable systems",
    "are the prismatic symmetries considered because the o lattice is effectively unchanged for the prismatic systems and only the cr ion stacking ( in the [ 10@xmath160 ] direction ) is changed as discussed above .",
    "this effectively changes the bonding structure of the cr without changing the o lattice .",
    "conversely , the rhombohedral system , which is the second most favorable system , is characterized by moderate strain at the interface demonstrated by the single strained cr - o bond for the interfacial cr and the o , which does not significantly modify the dos .",
    "this results in an energetically stable structure between the two prismatic systems .",
    "the energetically favorable basal plane system follows the prismatic and rhombohedral interfaces because the rotational symmetry system combines the strained interface with a cr ordering change ( this time in the [ 0001 ] direction ) .",
    "finally , the single stable pyramidal plane interface is of the highest energy of the four planes considered because of the high number of strained atomic planes as discussed above with both the cr - cr interfacial plane distance and the o - o interfacial planes distance compressed between 0.2 @xmath25 and 0.4 @xmath25 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied twin grain boundaries with multiple symmetries for each of the rhombohedral , basal , prismatic , and pyramidal planes based upon the structures from the literature for al@xmath0o@xmath1 , which has the same corundum structure followed by a dos analysis . from this",
    "we see that the prismatic screw with a cr - o plane interface is energetically the most preferred system .",
    "the rhombohedral screw symmetry interface with vacancy termination , the prismatic glide symmetry interface and the basal rotational symmetry interface being the second , third and fourth energetically preferred systems respectively , with a range of @xmath260.4 j / m@xmath15 among them . the remaining interfaces then start with at least this much higher energy than the basal rotational system .",
    "this suggests that other systems are significantly less likely than these four preferred systems , which therefore means that these four interfaces will be the most common twin grain boundaries found in poly - crystalline cr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "further the dos reveal that the prismatic systems have higher polarized defect states than the rhombohedral screw interface .",
