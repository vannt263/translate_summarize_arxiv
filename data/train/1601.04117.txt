    "we will explain this other option in ",

    "note also that @xmath922 this leads us to consider @xmath923 with the quadratic form given by @xmath924 .",
    "then , we have @xmath925 .",

    "if @xmath936 , then the ( anti)-involutions are given by @xmath937 and @xmath938 the even and odd parts of the clifford algebra are given by @xmath939 the clifford algebra @xmath848 embeds in the clifford algebra @xmath901 via @xmath940 and therefore , we will identify @xmath941 with @xmath942 .",

    "if @xmath20 is one of the orthogonal geometries of  [ symmetric ] , and one writes @xmath981 for some orthogonal geometry @xmath65 , where @xmath982 is a line with quadratic form @xmath881 , then the authors of @xcite are working with the short exact sequence @xmath983 whereas we are rather working with the following short exact sequence @xmath984 our approach has the advantage that we can study directly the weyl group instead of only the even part of the weyl group .",
    "moreover , the formulas giving the reflections are simpler in our situation . to be precise , the authors of @xcite also work over @xmath252 instead of @xmath672 , but it seems to clarify the picture quite a bit if one works over @xmath672 instead of over @xmath252 . as a last remark , we also point out that we are not dealing with an explicit set of known generators for the groups @xmath985 as was done in @xcite for @xmath986 and @xmath987 for instance .",
