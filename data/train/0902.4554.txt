    "since the discovery of the first extrasolar planet around a solar - type star @xcite , observers have now detected 322 planets around stars outside the solar system .",
    "many of these planets have roughly jovian masses and orbit their host stars in orbits with semi - major axes less than @xmath0 au , the so - called `` hot jupiters '' ( hjs ) . in both of the giant planet formation scenarios , core accretion and gravitational instability , we are unable to produce hjs in situ .",
    "we require the formation of close - in planets much further out ( @xmath1 several au ) in the protoplanetary disc , before a migratory process that brings the planet in towards the star and to its present location @xcite .",
    "the formation of systems with giant planets can be thought of as occurring in two oversimplified stages @xcite . during stage 1",
    "the cores of the giant planets are formed , they accrete gas and undergo migration , driven by the dynamical interaction between the planets and the gaseous protoplanetary disc ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this stage lasts a few myr until the gas dissipates , by which time a population of gas giants may exist .",
    "if these form sufficiently closely packed then stage 2 follows .",
    "this stage lasts from when the disc has dissipated and continues until the present , and primarily involves gravitational interactions and collisions between the planets .",
    "recent studies into stage 2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown that this is a chaotic era , in which planet - planet scatterings force the ejection of all but a few ( @xmath2 ) planets from the system in a period of large - scale dynamical instability lasting @xmath3yr .",
    "this mechanism can excite the eccentricities of the planets to levels required to explain observations .",
    "planet - planet scatterings tend also to excite the inclinations of the planets with respect to the initial symmetry plane of the system , potentially leading to observable consequences via the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect , which allows a measurement of @xmath4 , the sky - projected angle of misalignment of the stellar spin and the orbit @xcite .",
    "misaligned orbits are not predicted from stage 1 alone , so if @xmath4 is measured to be appreciably nonzero in enough systems , then it could be seen as evidence for planet - planet scattering , or alternatively kozai migration ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is because gas - disc migration does not seem able to excite orbital inclination ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , if observed planets are all found with @xmath4 consistent with zero , this could rule out planet - planet scattering or kozai migration as being of any importance .",
    "one important consideration is that at such close proximity to their parent stars , strong tidal interactions are expected to change @xmath4 ( actually the true spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath5 ) over time .",
    "if tides can significantly change @xmath4 since the time of formation , we may have difficulty in distinguishing between the possible hj formation mechanisms of planet - planet scattering , kozai migration and gas - disc migration .",
    "below we approach the problem of studying the effects of tidal friction on such inclined orbits .",
    "the efficiency of tidal dissipation in a body is usually parametrised by a dimensionless quality factor @xmath6 , defined by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the maximum energy stored in an oscillation and the integral represents the energy dissipated over one oscillation period .",
    "we find it convenient to define @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the second - order potential love number , since this combination appears together in the theory .",
    "@xmath11 is in principle a function of the tidal forcing frequency and the amplitude of the tidal disturbance , and is a result of complex dissipative processes in each body @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that @xmath11 for solar - type stars depends in a highly erratic way on the tidal forcing frequency @xcite . in light of the uncertainties involved in calculating @xmath11 , and the difficulty of calculating the evolution",
    "when @xmath11 depends on tidal frequency , we adopt a simplified model based on an equilibrium tide with constant lag time , using the formulation of @xcite .",
    "this formulation is beneficial because it can treat arbitrary orbital eccentricities and stellar and planetary obliquities .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite or @xcite for the full set of equations used .",
    "observations of solar - type stars show that the mean stellar rotational velocity decreases with main - sequence age @xcite , following the relation @xmath12 .",
    "magnetic braking by a magnetised outflowing wind has long been recognised as an important mechanism for the removal of angular momentum from rotating stars @xcite , and such a mechanism seems able to explain ( on average ) most of the observed stellar spin - down @xcite .",
    "here we include the effects of magnetic braking in the tidal evolution equations , through the inclusion of the magnetic braking torque of @xcite .",
    "this gives the following term into of the equation for @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 yr , giving a braking timescale @xmath16 yr for the sun .",
    "we study the effects of magnetic braking on a simplified system of a circular , coplanar orbit under the influence of only the stellar tide and magnetic braking .",
    "the following set of dimensionless equations can be derived @xcite : @xmath17 where we have normalised the stellar rotation @xmath18 and orbital mean motion @xmath19 to the orbital frequency at the stellar surface , together with a factor @xmath20 ( to some power ) .",
    "@xmath20 is the ratio of the orbital angular momentum of an orbit with semi - major axis equal to the stellar radius @xmath21 , of a mass @xmath22 , with the spin angular momentum of an equally rapidly rotating star of radius @xmath21 , mass @xmath23 and dimensionless radius of gyration @xmath24 .",
    "the reduced mass is @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath20 is important for classifying the stability of the equilibrium curve @xmath26 in the absence of magnetic braking , and it can be shown that this equilibrium is stable if @xmath27 i.e. no more than a quarter of the total angular momentum can be in the form of spin angular momentum @xcite .",
    "we have thus defined the following dimensionless quantities : @xmath28    there is only one parameter ( @xmath29 ) that completely characterises the solution in the @xmath30-plane , and its value may be estimated as @xmath31 for a jupiter - mass planet orbiting a sun - like star undergoing magnetic braking ( with standard @xmath32 and with @xmath33 ) .",
    "the size of this term shows that in general magnetic braking dominates the stellar spin evolution .",
    "we plot some solutions on the @xmath34-plane , restricting ourselves to @xmath35 .",
    "this represents the full range of orbits of the hjs , since @xmath36 corresponds to an orbital semi - major axis of @xmath37 au , and @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath39 au .    with the inclusion of magnetic braking ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : withmbplots ] ) , an initially rapidly rotating solar - type star hosting a hj for which @xmath40 , will spin down as a result of the magnetic torque . during this stage of spin - down the spin frequency of the star",
    "may temporarily equal the orbital frequency of its close - in planet , but the rate of angular momentum loss through magnetic braking will exceed the tidal rate of transfer of angular momentum from orbit to spin .",
    "the stellar spin continues to drop well below synchronism until the efficiency of tidal transfer of angular momentum from orbit to spin can compensate or overcompensate for the braking .",
    "the planet continues to spiral into the star once it moves inside corotation , and @xmath41 , unless the planet has sufficient angular momentum to be able to appreciably spin up the star .",
    "note that any bound orbit will eventually decay in a finite time since the system has no stable equilibrium .    without magnetic braking , the evolution is qualitatively different ( see right plot fig .",
    "[ fig : withmbplots ] ) , with orbits initially outside corotation ( @xmath42 ) asymptotically approaching a stable equilibrium @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "orbits initially inside corotation with @xmath43 near corotation , also approach a stable equilibrium ( though no such curves are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : withmbplots ] , since they occur only in the far bottom left of the plot , near the origin ) .",
    "this is when the corotation radius moves inwards faster than the orbit shrinks due to tidal friction , resulting in a final stable equilibrium state for the system if the corotation radius `` catches up '' with the planet . for orbits inside corotation",
    "for which this condition is not satisfied , the planet will spiral into the star under the influence of tides .",
    "it is common practice to interpret the effects of tidal evolution in terms of simple timescale estimates .",
    "the idea behind these is that if the rate of change of a quantity @xmath44 is exponential , then @xmath45 will be a constant , so we can define a timescale for the evolution of @xmath44 , given by @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 const , then @xmath48 may not accurately respresent the evolution .",
    "a tidal inspiral time can be calculated from @xmath49 ( see @xcite for the full evolution equations from which these timescales are derived ) , since @xmath50 .",
    "this assumes @xmath18 is constant , which we have seen is unreasonable unless @xmath51 , due to magnetic braking .",
    "if the orbital and stellar equatorial planes are misaligned by a small angle @xmath52 , then dissipation of the stellar tide would align them after a time @xmath53^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the orbital and stellar rotational periods .",
    "@xmath56 is the ratio of orbit to spin angular momentum . the validity of these timescales to accurately represent tidal evolution is an important subject of study , since they are commonly applied to observed systems .",
    "@xcite recently found it essential to consider the coupled evolution of @xmath57 and @xmath58 to accurately model tidal evolution , and that both the stellar and planetary tides must be included .",
    "they showed that the actual change of @xmath57 over time can be quite different from simple circularisation timescale considerations , due to the coupled evolution of @xmath58 . in the following we consider the validity of @xmath59 to accurately model tidal evolution of @xmath52 , using xo-3 as an illustrative example",
    "the only system currently observed with a spin - orbit misalignment is xo-3 @xcite , which has a sky - projected spin - orbit misalignment of @xmath60 .",
    "this system has a very massive @xmath61 planet on a moderately eccentric @xmath62 , @xmath63 d orbit around an f - type star of mass @xmath64 .",
    "its age is estimated to be @xmath65 gyr .",
    "note that even if the star is rotating near breakup velocity ( @xmath66 d ) , the planet is still subject to tidal inspiral , since @xmath67 ( where we henceforth assume @xmath68 , which may slightly _ underestimate _ @xmath52 ) .",
    "@xcite quote a spin - orbit alignment timescale of @xmath69 yr for this system , but we find that this is in error by @xmath70 .",
    "we believe that the reason for this discrepancy is that their estimate was based on assuming that the spin - orbit alignment time for xo-3 b is the same as for hd17156 b , which is a less massive planet on a much wider orbit .",
    "we find @xmath71 myr assuming @xmath72 to align the whole star with the orbit .",
    "integrations for this system are given in fig .",
    "[ figxo-3 ] for a variety of stellar @xmath11 values . for the system to survive and remain with its current inclination for @xmath73",
    "gyr we require @xmath74 .",
    "these integrations highlight the importance of considering coupled evolution of the orbital and rotational elements , since timescales for tidal evolution are quite different from simple estimates .",
    "indeed , the actual spin - orbit alignment time from integrating the coupled equations is about an order of magnitude smaller than that from the simple decay estimate , due to coupled @xmath58 evolution .    for this system , and for typical hjs , we find that @xmath75 .",
    "this means that if we observe a planet , then its survival implies that tides are unlikely to have aligned its orbit .",
    "in addition , for systems on an accelerating inspiral into the star , the rate of inclination evolution will have been much lower in the past ; therefore , if we observe a planet well inside corotation with a roughly coplanar orbit , we can assume that it must have started off similarly coplanar .",
    "an explanation for the survival and remnant orbital inclination of xo-3 b could be the result of inefficient tidal dissipation in the host star .",
    "a calculation of @xmath11 using the numerical method of @xcite and a stellar model appropriate for this star was performed @xcite .",
    "this predicts that the dissipation is weak , and @xmath76 for most tidal frequencies for the host star xo-3 .",
    "this can explain the survival and remnant inclination of this planet , since both inspiral and spin - orbit alignment take longer than the current age of the system .",
    "magnetic braking is important for calculating the long - term tidal evolution of hjs unless @xmath51 , and changes the qualitative behaviour of the evolution significantly . tidal evolution can be much faster than simple timescale estimates predict when coupled integration of the orbital and rotational elements is considered .",
    "in addition , we find that @xmath77 for typical hjs , so the orbits of most close - in planets have probably not aligned , and are likely to be a relic of the migration process .",
    "this means that rm effect observations of transiting planets can potentially distinguish between planet - planet scattering , kozai migration and gas - disc migration ."
