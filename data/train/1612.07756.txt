    "de sitter space is a lorentzian manifold of constant positive curvature , which is a solution to the einstein s field equations with a positive cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "it plays very prominent roles in theoretical cosmology , since the observed accelerating expansion of the universe is very well explained by just such a @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , de sitter space also provides the arena for early inflationary universe .",
    "although in cosmology one often uses the flat slicing of de sitter space , such a slicing does not cover the entire spacetime .",
    "here we are more concerned with the actual , _ global _ , structure of de sitter space .",
    "globally , the topology of de sitter space  _ as we have come to know it _",
    " is @xmath3 .",
    "however , a little known fact is that de sitter himself did _ not _ have the same topology in mind for `` de sitter space '' @xcite .",
    "instead , he preferred to topologically identify the antipodal points on the @xmath1 .",
    "this yields the projective space @xmath4 , which , like @xmath1 , is an orientable spin manifold , and thus is a well - behaved spatial geometry for a spacetime .",
    "( this is not true for real projective spaces in all dimensions @xcite . )",
    "@xmath0 admits the same metric as that of @xmath1 , since the metric tensor is a local quantity which is not sensitive to the global topology .",
    "this is the reason why einstein s field equations  a system of differential equations  can not uniquely fix the topology .",
    "specifically , a 3-sphere with sectional curvature @xmath5 admits a metric tensor of the form @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . for a real projective space",
    ", we have _ exactly the same _ metric expression : @xmath9,\\ ] ] but now the coordinates on the 3-spheres are mapped in such a way that antipodal points are identified .",
    "namely , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "we will refer to this as the _ antipodal map_.    the topology of de sitter space , as de sitter understood it , is therefore @xmath13 , which , following @xcite , we shall denote by @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "similarly , the de sitter space with @xmath3 topology will be denoted by @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the reason de sitter favoured @xmath14 $ ] over @xmath15 $ ] is that , following schwarzschild s paper in 1900 @xcite , the fact that @xmath1 has antipodal points means that the global geometry `` forces a correlation '' between these two otherwise faraway points . geometrically",
    ", any two coplanar geodesics in @xmath1 would intersect twice , whereas in @xmath0 they would intersect only once . since the intersection of geodesics is a matter of _ local _ physics",
    ", it would seem strange that this would somehow force a correlation at the antipodal point , which is well outside the current observable universe ! it is for this reason that de sitter considered @xmath0 to be `` the simpler case , and it is preferable to adopt this for the physical world '' @xcite .",
    "the penrose diagram of both @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath14 $ ] are shown in fig.([penrose1 ] ) . in the familiar case of @xmath15 $ ] , there are two causal patches that are out of causal contact .",
    "an observer centered at the  arbitrary ",
    "pole @xmath16 would not be able to see the antipode of the @xmath1 ( namely , _ the other _",
    "@xmath16 ) at the other end of the universe . in @xmath14",
    "$ ] , due to the topological identification , _ there is no antipode_. since the left and right hemispheres of the @xmath1 are identified by the antipodal map , only half of the penrose diagram of @xmath15 $ ] remains .",
    "the equator of @xmath1 is a @xmath17 , which , under the antipodal map , becomes a @xmath18 .",
    "thus , in the penrose diagram of @xmath14 $ ] , which is on the right of fig.([penrose1 ] ) , each point on the double line corresponds to a @xmath18 .",
    "an observer , say , alice , who started at @xmath16 and travels toward the @xmath18 equator , would , upon traveling through @xmath18 , find herself now traveling back toward @xmath16 , since she is `` reflected '' back by the topological identification .",
    "it is , however , not exactly a reflection ( since alice is traveling _ through _  not _ within _ ",
    "@xmath18 ) . instead",
    ", she would find that the universe seems to have been rotated upside down .",
    "see @xcite for more discussions .",
    "note that this `` reflection '' is not imposed as a boundary condition by hand , instead it is an unavoidable consequence of the topological identification .",
    "$ ] ; * right : * the penrose diagram of @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "each point of the double line corresponds to a @xmath18 on the equator of @xmath0 .",
    "slanted lines are cosmological horizons . the dashed lines and the regions labeled a , b , c should be ignored at this point ; they will be discussed later.[penrose1],width=332 ]    to our modern eyes , it does not seem that @xmath14 $ ] with a nontrivial topology is `` simpler '' than @xmath15 $ ] . to better appreciate what de sitter meant ,",
    "let us reproduce the example in @xcite , which is to consider a schwarzschild - de sitter black hole . to this end , let us start with a stellar collapse in @xmath15 $ ] , which produces a black hole at the pole @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting schwarzschild - de sitter metric tensor reads    g[[^3]]=&-(1 - -)t^2 + + & + r^2(^2 + ^2 ^ 2 ) .    here , the notation @xmath19 $ ] only serves to remind us that for @xmath20 , we recover a de sitter space with @xmath1 cross section .",
    "the topology of this spacetime with a black hole is of course not @xmath3 .",
    "since there are two locations that correspond to @xmath16 ( namely the north and the south poles of the @xmath1 ) , introducing a black hole at one pole apparently also implies the existence of another black hole at the other pole .",
    "in fact , this then forces us to add more black holes _",
    "ad infinitum _ , and the resulting penrose diagram of schwarzschild - de sitter black hole extends indefinitely in the horizontal direction , as in fig.([penrose2 ] ) .",
    "this scenario is not physical , since we do not expect that a _ local _ gravitational collapse would produce another black hole at the `` other side '' of the universe , much less infinitely many black holes . a possible way out of this conundrum is to topologically identify the spacetime such that one obtains what naively looks like the maximally extended version of an asymptotically flat schwarzschild black hole ( the kruskal - szekeres spacetime ) , as shown in fig.([penrose2b ] ) . at this point , one should ask : does this picture now represent a physically acceptable geometry ? in the asymptotically flat case , the answer is yes  in the sense that in a realistic gravitational collapse , the interior is replaced by the infalling stellar matter so that the second asymptotically flat region on the other side of the einstein - rosen bridge is removed .",
    "however , this can not be done here . due to the topological identification ,",
    "the second region that should be removed in a realistic gravitational collapse is , in fact , _ identical _ to the exterior spacetime .",
    "that is , to quote @xcite , `` _ _ the ` other ' universe which we so casually consign to non - existence is in fact our own . _ _ '' the conclusion is that neither the picture in fig.([penrose2 ] ) nor the one in fig.([penrose2b ] ) can be considered physical . however ,",
    "if we take de sitter space to be @xmath14 $ ] , then this problem does not arise , since introducing a black hole at `` @xmath16 '' does not entail another black hole at the other pole , simply because there is _ no other pole _ !",
    "the diagram extends indefinitely toward the right , as well as the left hand side.[penrose2],width=288 ]    $ ] , but with topological identification , so that instead of indefinitely many black holes as in fig.([penrose2 ] ) , we only have one black hole . [ penrose2b],width=268 ]    despite the aforementioned discussion , since the universe is likely to be large enough that its global topology can not be observed directly , one is tempted to argue that whether @xmath14 $ ] should be preferred over @xmath15 $ ] is merely based on philosophical or aesthetic grounds , or at best , on mathematical grounds . however ,",
    "this is not the case  while there is no problem with quantum field theories in @xmath14 $ ] , there _ are _ physical observables that could _ in principle _ tell us whether our universe is indeed @xmath14 $ ] , or @xmath15 $ ] @xcite .",
    "for example , an inertial observer who couples to a free scalar field through a monopole detector could distinguish the difference between these two spaces , although the difference become exponentially small in the distant past or future on the observer s worldline @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . )    in @xcite , mcinnes argued that the distinction between @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] could be an important one in the context of _ quantum cosmology_. in particular , the distinction could be important in the attempt to understand the horizon entropy of a de sitter universe  while @xmath14 $ ] , with its richer structure at conformal infinity , allows a relatively straightforward interpretation of the horizon entropy as entanglement entropy , surprisingly , @xmath15 $ ] _ does not_. ( the argument relies on the mathematical fact that the connected sum of two @xmath0 is not the same as that of two @xmath1 .",
    "the latter is trivial : @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xmath22 . ) since the horizon entropy of de sitter space shares the same properties with the bekenstein - hawking entropy of black holes , i.e. , it is a quarter of the horizon area in planck units @xcite , and it exhibits a temperature much like that of hawking temperature , it is likely they both have the same underlying physical origin . lately",
    ", it seems increasingly likely that black hole entropy is indeed entanglement entropy ( though some questions remain  see @xcite ) , so it would seem that the @xmath14 $ ] picture does have some advantages .",
    "moreover , black holes in @xmath14 $ ] have causal structures that can be argued to be more physical than that of a black hole in @xmath15 $ ] , as was discussed earlier .",
    "( a black hole in @xmath14 $ ] has some similarities with the so - called `` geon black holes '' @xcite , but they are different geometries altogether .",

    "a major research program in quantum cosmology concerns the study of the wave function of the universe , known as the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the wave function can be derived from a euclidean path integral , which is schematically of the form @xmath23}=",
    "\\int \\mathcal{d}[g]\\mathcal{d}[\\varphi ] e^{-i[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\varphi]},\\ ] ] involving a sum over all possible geometries , and over all histories that are connected by two hypersurfaces .",
    "( if the euclidean geometry is not connected , i.e. , in the `` nothing - to - something '' scenario  see below  we remove the initial hypersurface @xmath24 and @xmath25 . )",
    "the euclidean path integral is a good approximation of the ground state wave function , which can be approximated by solving for on - shell solutions known as `` instantons '' .",
    "specifically the wave function is to a good approximation , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the action of a saddle - point solution which satisfies the euclidean einstein s field equations with some prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "instantons provide a mean to calculate the probability of one geometry tunneling into another , @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "one possibility is that the universe was initially some lorentzian spacetime , but underwent a tunneling into a different lorentzian spacetime .",
    "such a picture is provided by , e.g. , the farhi - guth - guven tunneling @xcite , and fischler - morgan - polchinski tunneling @xcite .",
    "mathematically , an instanton is a complete non - singular euclidean manifold that `` connects '' these two lorentzian spacetimes . in the language of @xcite , such kind of tunneling",
    "is dubbed `` something - to - something '' .",
    "( of course , it is possible that not everywhere in the initial spacetime undergoes such tunneling , but only a `` small '' patch , which leads to a `` pocket universe '' . )",

    "more precisely , by `` connected '' , we mean the following : start with @xmath30 foliated by a family of spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath34 , where @xmath35 $ ] corresponds to the time direction in which @xmath34 evolves via einstein s equations . at time @xmath36",

    ", we do not usually consider the contracting phase . in this case , we take only the top half of the left figure in fig.([interpretation ] ) , and interpret the tunneling as `` creation from nothing ''",
    " la hartle and hawking @xcite .    ,",
    "width=336 ]    an alternative interpretation of the tunneling was proposed by brown and weinberg @xcite , in which the @xmath36 hypersurface of the right causal patch of the lorentzian de sitter space is treated as the `` initial state '' , while the @xmath36 hypersurface of the left causal patch is treated as the `` final state '' .",

    "such an argument that involves causal patches of de sitter space should now be familiar to us  it is exactly the sort of issues that are relevant to the debate whether ds[@xmath0 ] should be preferred over ds[@xmath1 ] . in the case of ds[@xmath0 ] , there is _ only one _ causal patch .",
    "one thus naturally wonders , whether in the case of ds[@xmath0 ] , the instanton tunneling still admits both `` nothing - to - something '' and `` something - to - something '' interpretations .",

    "[ estatic],width=316 ]    this naively admits a `` something - to - something '' tunneling to @xmath14 $ ] . in fig.([penrose1 ] ) , we show the penrose diagrams of both @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath14 $ ] , but with the spacelike slice @xmath36 highlighted .",
    "the significance of this slice will become clear in a moment . note that under the antipodal map , e.g. , region c in the left diagram is identified with a , so in the right diagram , we only have half of the `` original '' diagram , and again the double line on the right boundary of @xmath14 $ ] denotes the @xmath18 equator .",
    "a `` something - to - something '' tunneling can naively be constructed by pasting region a and region b of the lorentzian @xmath14 $ ] to the euclidean @xmath109 $ ] , so that the @xmath36 slice of region b serves as the initial state , which `` rotates '' through the euclidean sector and ends with @xmath36 slice of section a ; see fig.([wickrotaterp3 ] ) .",
    "note that every point on the red double line in fig.([wickrotaterp3 ] ) is a @xmath18 . in this picture",
    ", we take @xmath114 to be the poles of our @xmath76 , so that under antipodal map , the resulting @xmath110-orbifold has fixed points there . due to the fixed points being exactly on the hypersurface on which the lorentzian geometry is pasted with the euclidean one ,",
    "an obstruction arises from the nature of the fixed point .",
    "as we have mentioned , the fixed point under the antipodal map means that the geometry is not a riemannian manifold at the neighborhood of the fixed point , but the lorentzian spacetime is a manifold everywhere .",
    "more crucially , on the purported matching surface , each point on the euclidean side is @xmath18 , but the lorentzian geometry is @xmath17 ( except at the black dot , i.e. , on the cosmological horizon , where it is also @xmath18 ) .",
    "therefore this `` matching surface '' is not allowed topologically .",
    "such an obstruction would mean that case i is _ not _ an acceptable picture .",
    "another possibility is to consider wick - rotating along the blue dashed line as shown in fig.([fixedpoints ] ) .",
    "this gives rise to a `` nothing - to - something '' tunneling as shown in fig.([nts ] ) .",
    "this scenario has been previously analyzed in @xcite .",
    "however , it would be difficult to consider an inhomogeneous instanton in this case .",
    "in fact , there are several problems regarding this scenario .",
    "* there are fixed points ( indicated by the blue dots in fig.([fixedpoints ] ) ) . upon",
    "wick - rotating to lorentzian signature , there is only one fixed point to be considered ( fig.[nts ] ) but it is not clear whether this will give rise to any problem when one calculates the action .",
    "note that this fixed point is `` far away '' from the identification surface where the euclidean geometry meets the lorentzian one , so there is no problem at least at the level of pasting the surface to the lorentzian geometry .",
    "nevertheless , one might worry that the calculation of the wave function might be `` obstructed '' by the presence of a fixed point .",
    "* if we do couple a scalar field to gravity , then we have to worry about the boundary condition .",
    "if we prescribe the neumann condition at the blue dashed line ( @xmath115 ) , then there may be some non - trivial oscillating solutions ( with @xmath116 symmetry @xcite ) .",
    "such a solution has more than one negative mode @xcite .",
    "therefore , this may not be the most preferred path for tunneling . *",
    "even if there is no scalar field , the probability of the instanton tunneling is much less than that of the original hawking - moss instanton . to see this , note that the volume of the euclidean manifold is halved under the antipodal map , and since @xmath117 is negative for de sitter space",
    ", we have the probability @xmath118 .",
    "is shown . *",
    "right : * the resulting quotient geometry consists of a hemisphere of @xmath76 , the boundary in blue corresponds to a @xmath0 .",
    "we have two fixed points indicated by the blue dots .",
    "[ fixedpoints],width=316 ]        another possibility is to consider a `` something - to - something '' tunneling , but instead of a euclidean projective space as the instanton , we just take the good old euclidean 4-sphere @xmath76 .",
    "we illustrate this possibility in fig.([noid ] ) , which bears a lot of resemblance with fig.([wickrotaterp3 ] ) .",
    "however , at the matching surface , instead of a red double line that denotes @xmath0 equator , we now have a red single line that denotes the usual , @xmath1 , equator .",
    "note that except the black dot in the middle which is quite peculiar , every interior point in this diagram corresponds to a @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , this means that topologically there is no obstruction at the matching surface _ almost everywhere _ ( in the technical sense of a lebesgue ( volume ) measure ) .",
    "the only problem is at the black dot  there on the euclidean side it is a @xmath17 , but on the lorentzian side it is @xmath18 , so matching fails at the cosmological horizon .",
    "however , it is not clear if this is a serious obstacle , since the problematic region is a set of measure zero .",
    "since the instanton is @xmath76 , the probability of tunneling into @xmath14 $ ] is the same as the tunneling probability from @xmath76 to @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "thus case iii , if it works , has tunneling probability that is higher compared to case ii .",
    "discussion the accelerating expansion of the universe is well - described by the presence of a positive cosmological constant @xmath119 . despite many attempts to explain the accelerating expansion using either modified gravity or various forms of dark energy , the cosmological constant remains the simplest explanation that also fits the observational data very well .",
    "our universe is therefore well - modeled by an asymptotically de sitter space .",
    "however , on the theoretical level , the effort to understand asymptotically de sitter spaces has just barely begun ( it is _ not _ true that since @xmath2 is small , one can always assume that the results obtained in asymptotically flat geometries apply straightforwardly , see @xcite ) , and many puzzles remain to be fully solved @xcite .    in this work , we are concerned with the global topology of the de sitter space , which although commonly taken to be @xmath3 , is _ not _ what de sitter originally had in mind . instead , what de sitter considered was a spacetime with topology @xmath13 , which we denoted as @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "following @xcite , we explained why @xmath14 $ ] is arguably more physical than @xmath15 $ ] , despite @xmath0 is often thought of as a `` more complicated '' geometry relative to @xmath1 in modern eyes .",
    "given the nice features of @xmath14 $ ] from both the classical perspective and quantum cosmological perspective ( as far as entanglement entropy is concerned ) @xcite , we are motivated to explore the quantum cosmological aspect of @xmath14 $ ] further .    our main concern is to study how @xmath14 $ ] can be created from instanton tunneling . in this work",
    ", we found two ( potentially ) viable scenarios : a `` nothing - to - something '' tunneling in which the euclidean geometry corresponds to a @xmath110-orbifold , and a `` something - to - something '' tunneling in which the euclidean manifold is @xmath76 .",
    "the latter scenario has a higher tunneling probability , however the matching surface between the euclidean geometry and the lorentzian geometry fails at a point ( where the cosmological horizon meets the @xmath18 equator on the lorentzian side ) .",
    "this might not be a serious problem since it is a set of measure zero , but a further investigation will be required to check if this is indeed a viable tunneling scenario .",
    "the `` nothing - to - something '' tunneling from @xmath110-orbifold is not without issue since it has a fixed point at the south pole , which although `` far away '' from the matching surface , might be problematic in the actual computation of the action .",
    "however , the fixed point is milder than the singularities in `` singular instantons '' .",
    "again , a further study is required to understand whether this tunneling picture works .",
    "we ruled out the `` something - to - something '' tunneling between the @xmath110-orbifold to @xmath14 $ ] since the fixed points are on the `` matching surface '' , and further more said matching can not be done at all due to the euclidean section having different topology than the lorentzian section .    to conclude , it was shown in @xcite that the euclidean version of @xmath15 $ ] admits two different tunneling pictures : `` something - to - something '' and `` nothing - to - something '' . here , we argue that @xmath14 $ ] might very well also admit these two pictures of tunneling ( and so the possibility that our universe is in fact @xmath14 $ ] remains viable in the context of euclidean quantum cosmology ) , but there remain some subtleties that deserve further investigations .",
