    "teleportation @xcite makes possible a wide variety of nonlocal quantum processes provided sufficient prior entanglement and classical communication are available . to change the quantum state of two systems @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "separated in space it is only necessary to teleport the @xmath0 state to the laboratory where @xmath1 is located , carry out the desired operation , and teleport the result back again . the present paper is concerned with certain types of operations , nonlocal unitaries , which can be achieved at lower cost , in particular less prior entanglement than is needed for two - way teleportation .    protocols of this sort for qubits were developed by eisert et al.@xcite and reznik et al .",
    "@xcite , and our work builds upon theirs .",
    "see @xcite for other deterministic and probabilistic protocols .",
    "we only consider the deterministic case in which the desired unitary is carried out with probability 1 ; finding efficient protocols that allow for some noise is a challenging problem not addressed here . while our protocols can be applied to an arbitrary nonlocal unitary , only in special cases",
    "are they more efficient than teleportation .",
    "there are two separate motivations behind studies of the sort presented here .",
    "first , it seems likely that nonlocal operations will play a significant role in future quantum computers , especially schemes for distributed computation @xcite , and achieving them using prior entanglement is an option that deserves consideration . since",
    "producing entanglement is likely to be expensive , there is an obvious advantage to protocols which use as little of it as possible . by comparison , classical communication",
    "is usually thought of as cheap , since it does not have to be protected from decoherence .",
    "however , protocols that minimize its use might still have an advantage over those that require more .",
    "a second motivation is the desire to better understand the role of different types of quantum information @xcite in various information - processing tasks .",
    "general nonlocal unitaries require physical influences to propagate from one side to the other , in fact in both directions , and one would like to understand these in rational terms rather than by invoking quasimagical `` collapses '' and the like .",
    "it turns out that unitary operations place particularly stringent conditions on the presence or absence of different types of information at different locations and different times throughout a protocol , and knowing what these are can provide insight into why certain gates and measurements need to be employed rather than others . in this respect",
    "our analysis represents an advance over earlier work .",
    "our protocols are based upon expanding a nonlocal unitary on @xmath2 in the form @xmath3 where the hilbert spaces @xmath4 , @xmath5 have finite dimensions @xmath6 respectively , the @xmath7 operators satisfy special conditions , or are of a particular type , and the expansion coefficients @xmath8 , obviously constrained by the requirement that @xmath9 be unitary , may have additional special properties . in the simplest situation of",
    "`` controlled '' unitaries , the one easiest to understand in information - theoretic terms , the @xmath7 form a projective decomposition of the identity on @xmath4 , and the @xmath8 are arbitrary unitaries on @xmath5 . a more complex , but also more general case is unitaries of `` group '' form ( or `` group - unitaries '' ) , when the @xmath7 are unitary operators that form a representation , possibly a projective representation , of a group @xmath10 , and the sum in is a sum over elements in this group . here",
    "the @xmath8 may also be proportional to unitary operators forming a ( projective ) representation of the same group @xmath10 , but that is not a requirement of our protocol . actually any bipartite unitary can be written in this form with some suitable choice of the group @xmath10 , thus the term `` group - unitaries '' should be regarded as describing the form of expansion of @xmath9 , rather than a property of @xmath9 itself .",
    "there is some relationship between our use of groups for nonlocal unitaries and the protocol of klappenecker et al . @xcite for implementing local unitary gates .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sct2 ] indicates the general strategy for our protocols , shows through a diagrammatic approach why groups are useful , establishes an information theorem that is useful when discussing unitaries , and a lower bound on how much entanglement is needed .",
    "the discussion of particular protocols begins in sec .",
    "[ sct3 ] with controlled unitaries that generalize @xcite and are easily understood in information - theoretic terms .",
    "the presentation of the main group - unitary protocol in sec .",
    "[ sct4 ] begins with a general definition and a quantum circuit , followed by a detailed analysis in sec .",
    "[ sct4b ] of why the protocol works .",
    "a procedure related to group fourier transforms is used in sec .",
    "[ sct4c ] to give a general parametrization of unitaries which can be realized in this fashion .",
    "a particular case in which the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems are treated in a symmetrical fashion is the subject of sec .",
    "[ sct4d ] , and in sec .",
    "[ sct4e ] it is shown that the controlled unitaries of sec .",
    "[ sct3 ] can be rewritten in the group form in an efficient way .",
    "several specific examples of nonlocal unitaries are presented in sec .",
    "this is followed by a summary of the paper in sec .",
    "[ sct6 ] , which notes some issues deserving further study .",
    "the appendices contain proofs and other subsidiary material .",
    "the protocols discussed in this paper all have a common structure indicated schematically in fig .",
    "the two parties share an entangled state on ancillary systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "alice performs a unitary gate @xmath13 on systems @xmath11 and @xmath0 , followed by a measurement of the @xmath11 system .",
    "she sends the ( classical ) measurement result to bob , who uses this to determine which unitary @xmath14 to carry out on @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "bob then measures the @xmath12 system and sends the result back to alice , who uses this information to choose a unitary @xmath15 carried out on @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noting that the straightforward teleportation protocol mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sct1 ] can also be represented using fig .",
    "[ fgr1 ] provided the initial entangled resource is large enough to allow teleportation in both directions .",
    "( we leave as an exercise to the reader working out the details of the unitaries @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 needed to achieve this . )",
    "such protocols are inherently asymmetric in that one party has to take the first step , while the second party acts according to the information received from the first party .",
    "our most powerful protocols are based on expansions of the desired nonlocal unitary @xmath9 in terms of a matrix representation of a finite group .",
    "indeed , all unitaries can be expanded in this way . here , we explain why groups are useful utilizing an intuitive and visual presentation involving diagrams @xcite , from which as an additional benefit we will gain insight into one of our most important contributions , that unlike in previously published protocols , the schmidt rank @xmath16 of the entangled resource can be chosen independently of the dimensions @xmath6 of hilbert spaces @xmath17 on which @xmath9 acts .",
    "we note that it was by using these diagrams that we discovered the first of our protocols , which uses a uniformly entangled state to implement unitaries of the form @xmath18 with @xmath19 two sets of unitaries , and the operators @xmath20 form an ordinary representation of a group .",
    "all other protocols based on groups were then discovered as generalizations of this one .",
    "the idea underlying our diagrams is that the presence of entanglement on systems @xmath21 effectively creates multiple images of the states of other systems , in our case , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see @xcite for detailed discussion of these ideas ) .",
    "that is , the state @xmath22 on systems @xmath21 and @xmath23 on @xmath24 , can be represented by the diagram shown in fig .  [ fgr2 ] .",
    "following their respective controlled unitaries . ]",
    "given the way these images are distributed through the diagram , it is clear that alice and bob independently have `` access '' to each of the individual images , and by performing controlled unitaries , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , on each side , can together attach to each image one of the operators appearing in the terms of the sum for @xmath9 in .",
    "what we ultimately want is a particular linear combination of all these terms . to see how to accomplish this , note that a measurement on @xmath11 with outcome @xmath27 picks out a single row of the diagram , and thus a single image . on the other hand , a measurement outcome @xmath28 , places a sum of all the rows into a single row , which will appear as in fig .",
    "[ fgr3 ] ( all other rows disappearing ) , with each column containing one of the terms @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , if alice measures @xmath11 in the fourier basis ( or equivalently , performs a discrete fourier transform on @xmath11 and then measures in the standard basis ) , then for any outcome the diagram is collapsed into a single row , with each column containing one of the terms @xmath30 multiplied by a phase factor .",
    "these phase factors , @xmath31 , can easily be removed by bob performing @xmath32 on system @xmath12 leaving , for all outcomes of alice s measurement on @xmath11 , the diagram in fig .  [ fgr3 ] .",
    "the next step is for bob to make a measurement of his own on system @xmath12 , designed to place the factors @xmath33 on the appropriate images and to take linear sums of these terms , collapsing the diagram finally into a single small box .",
    "if he first performs a unitary @xmath34 , the first row of which is given by @xmath35 , and then measures in the standard basis with outcome corresponding to state @xmath36 , the result will be precisely the desired unitary operation , @xmath37 the question is how to complete this unitary , @xmath34 .",
    "clearly , we can not simply copy the first row into all the others , as the rows of a unitary matrix must all be mutually orthogonal , even though this would produce for every outcome of bob s subsequent measurement .",
    "one possibility that turns out will always work ( see sec .",
    "[ sct4d ] ) is to choose all the other rows of @xmath34 as permutations of its first row .",
    "this choice does not automatically yield , however , but we instead obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the permutation for the given outcome and @xmath40 , implying that our protocol has failed unless we can find a way to correct it .",
    "such a correction is certainly possible if there exist local unitaries on @xmath41 that together transform @xmath30 to @xmath42 , and hence @xmath43 into @xmath9 .",
    "this is where the notion of groups enters the picture . indeed , recalling that @xmath44 , then if alice and bob perform @xmath45 , and can choose @xmath46 such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath39 corresponding to the multiplication table of a group @xmath10 , then this transforms @xmath43 into @xmath9 and we have successfully , and deterministically , implemented @xmath9 .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sct4d ] for further details .",
    "note that the requirement expressed in the previous discussion is that @xmath49 each form a representation of the group @xmath10 .",
    "one could consider the possibility that they are non - unitary representations , but the corrections just described would then not generally be possible deterministically .",
    "therefore , we consider only unitary representations in the sequel .",
    "finally , we note that it should be clear from this discussion that @xmath16 can be chosen as a completely independent quantity ; in particular , there is no reason for it to be constrained by the values of @xmath50 or @xmath51 , as has been the case in previously known protocols .",
    "hence , the amount of entanglement needed to implement a given nonlocal unitary depends only on the form of the unitary itself  in particular for our protocols , on the possible ways it can be expanded in terms of a group  and not on the size of the local hilbert spaces upon which it acts .      to understand various aspects of our protocols",

    "[ fgr1 ] , by replacing measurements and classical communication with appropriate controlled unitaries , fig .  [ fgr4 ] . an easy way of seeing the equivalence of the two circuits in terms of their action on systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 is to imagine that the ancillary systems in fig .",

    "is one where the @xmath315 blocks of that make up @xmath9 contain mostly zeros , so can be conveniently written using dyads : @xmath320    one can also construct unitaries of the double unitary form , for example , with identical representations on two systems of equal dimension : @xmath321 since the @xmath255 and @xmath134 form representations of the same group , sets of possible coefficients @xmath262 , some of them shown in table  [ tbl1 ] , can be generated using formula , with the @xmath268 on the right side of this equation arbitrary unitaries that serve to parametrize the possible @xmath262 .",
    "the schmidt rank can not , of course , exceed 5 , and this can be achieved both with six and with five of the @xmath262 nonzero . as any five of the @xmath134 are linearly independent , the schmidt rank is equal to the number of nonzero @xmath262 s when the latter is five or less .",
    "@xmath322    examples with @xmath323 where the @xmath324 contain all three inequivalent irreducible representations are also easy to construct . in this case",
    "the @xmath134 are linearly independent so @xmath9 may have a schmidt rank of 6 . whatever the size of @xmath51 the protocol only requires an entanglement of @xmath317 , so it is more efficient than two - way teleportation for @xmath325 . here is a collection of simple @xmath326 blocks ,",
    "see , that yields @xmath9 with a schmidt rank of 6 when @xmath327 .",
    "@xmath328 one can also construct examples of the type with the @xmath262 determined in the same manner discussed earlier , in particular the four possibilities shown in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "now , however , the schmidt rank is simply the number of nonzero @xmath262 , consistent with the last column of the table .",
    "the nonabelian dihedral group @xmath329 of order 8 is of interest in that in addition to ordinary representations it also has projective representations with a nontrivial factor system . corresponding to the ordinary representations",
    "there are five inequivalent irreducible representations with dimensions 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , and 2 . analyzing nonlocal unitaries based on these is a problem similar to that discussed earlier in the case of @xmath306 ( @xmath307 ) .",
    "the nontrivial factor system gives rise to two inequivalent irreducible representations , each of dimension 2 , on which we now focus our attention .",
    "the simplest situation of interest is one in which @xmath323 and @xmath330 is the direct sum of the inequivalent projective representations just mentioned .",
    "then using a fully entangled state of schmidt rank 8 , entanglement of @xmath331 , our protocol can carry out any nonlocal unitary @xmath9 of the form @xmath332 , , where each block @xmath228 is a @xmath333 matrix .",
    "a simple example for @xmath334 is provided by the following collection of block matrices , see : @xmath335 another example , now for @xmath327 , uses the @xmath326 block matrices : @xmath336 the unitaries @xmath9 for both these examples have a schmidt rank of 8 . note that even for @xmath334 the entanglement cost of the protocol , @xmath331 , is less than two - way teleportation of the qutrit from @xmath1 to @xmath0 and back again .",
    "one expects that in the generic case unitaries of this type will have schmidt rank 8 , e.g. , if they are chosen randomly subject to having the appropriate block structure , though of course smaller schmidt ranks can also occur .",
    "it is also possible to construct unitaries of the form using the @xmath134 in .",
    "again all possible sets of @xmath262 can be generated using formula , but it is important to notice that the @xmath337 form a representation with a factor system equivalent to the trivial factor system , and which can be made trivial by choosing appropriate phases for the projective representation matrices on the right side of .",
    "consequently , the @xmath338 that appear on the right side of are the five ordinary irreducible representations of @xmath329 , while the @xmath268 in this formula are arbitrary complex numbers of unit magnitude for @xmath308 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , and an arbitrary @xmath339 unitary matrix for @xmath340 .",
    "our central result is the protocol in sec .",
    "[ sct4 ] which permits a unitary @xmath9 of the group form to be implemented nonlocally provided the @xmath134 form a projective unitary representation of a group @xmath10 , and the @xmath145 satisfy the condition .",
    "since the unitarity of @xmath9 guarantees the existence of a suitable set of @xmath145 even when the @xmath134 are not linearly independent , theorem  [ thm5 ] , the problem of constructing an efficient scheme using our protocol comes down to minimizing the number of terms in the sum , the order @xmath16 of the group @xmath10 , a task accomplished in @xcite .",
    "this is because the protocol requires a uniformly entangled state of schmidt rank @xmath16 ( entanglement equal to @xmath341 ) , and @xmath342 bits of classical communication , @xmath341 in each direction .",
    "an expansion of the group form is possible for any bipartite unitary @xmath9 , since if @xmath50 is the dimension of @xmath4 it is always possible to choose a representation of @xmath10 that is a basis of @xmath296 unitary operators for the operator space of @xmath4 as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sct5a ] . while our protocol works in this case , the required entanglement and communication resources are exactly the same as those required to teleport the quantum state of @xmath0 to the location of @xmath1 and back again .",
    "thus there is no gain in efficiency over simple teleportation , but on the other hand there is also no loss in generality : our protocol can be used for any bipartite unitary at a cost no greater than teleportation .    thus what makes our protocol of some interest from the point of view of efficiency is the existence of special unitaries @xmath9 for which the number of terms in the group expansion is smaller than @xmath296 , as illustrated by the examples in sec .",
    "these special @xmath9 are , to begin with , characterized by certain _ algebraic _ properties of the summands in or , properties which , in contrast to teleportation , make no direct reference to the dimensions of either @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "hence our examples can be realized in a large number of ways on spaces of different dimensions , and in the case of large dimensions the savings over teleportation can be substantial .",
    "a second useful characterization of these special unitaries is their schmidt rank , which is obviously a lower bound on the number of terms in , thus a lower bound on the order of the group and the amount of entanglement required for our protocol .",
    "furthermore , theorem  [ thm2 ] indicates there is a similar lower bound for any other protocol based on prior entanglement and classical communication , at least in terms of the schmidt rank of the entangled resource .",
    "the schmidt rank of a nonlocal unitary on @xmath2 will typically be the minimum of @xmath296 and @xmath343 , and only if a unitary has a schmidt rank less than this can our protocol hope to be more efficient than teleportation .",
    "a third requirement , not at all trivial , that must be met if a bipartite unitary is to be efficiently realized using our protocol is that it must possess a block diagonal form for an appropriate basis choice on one side@xmath4 in our discussion  a form commensurate with the structure of irreducible representations of an appropriate group , in the manner discussed in sec .",
    "[ sct4c ] and illustrated in some examples in sec .",
    "the requirement is slightly less stringent than appears at first sight , since initial and final local unitaries might be used to place @xmath9 in the appropriate block form .",
    "obviously , more study is needed in order to give a precise characterization of the class of unitaries that can be efficiently realized by our protocol .",
    "our protocol requires a fully or uniformly entangled state , one with @xmath16 equal nonzero schmidt coefficients .",
    "could one instead make efficient use of a partially entangled state of the same schmidt rank in a deterministic protocol of the sort we have been considering ?",
    "this would be consistent with theorem  [ thm2 ] if the entangling strength of the unitary were not too great .",
    "but even in the simplest case of a unitary on two qubits the answer is not known ( at least to us ) ; all published protocols that use an entangled state of schmidt rank 2 require a fully entangled state , even if the entangling strength of the unitary is very small .",
    "is there some principle of quantum information that requires the use of a fully - entangled state ?",
    "nondeterministic protocols or those which use an entangled state of higher schmidt rank are another matter ; for some interesting results in this connection see @xcite .",
    "we have introduced some information theoretical considerations in sec .",
    "[ sct2c ] and subsequently seen in secs .",
    "[ sct3 ] and [ sct4 ] how those can motivate or provide reasons for the choice of certain parts of the quantum circuit , and also a picture of how information contained initially in the @xmath0 system can be used to influence the @xmath1 system without leaving an unacceptable record in the ancillary systems .",
    "one suspects that similar considerations might lead to additional insights into the functioning of other efficient protocols .",
    "teleportation physically transports all of the @xmath0 information to the distant laboratory .",
    "a more efficient protocol seems possible only if not all of this information is really needed for the desired unitary , and the part which is needed can somehow be separated out and transferred at less cost than full teleportation . making these ideas precise and quantifying them could be useful in designing better protocols , as well as clarifying what quantum information is all about .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the national science foundation through grant nos .",
    "phy-0456951 and phy-0757251 .",
    "smc has also been supported by a grant from the research corporation .",
    "it is obvious that ( i ) implies ( ii ) and ( iii ) in theorem  [ thm1 ] , and that ( iii ) implies with @xmath69 times a constant in place of @xmath9 .",
    "however , as @xmath54 is assumed to be an isometry , @xmath69 times this constant must be unitary , i.e. , it preserves inner products of states @xmath60 in @xmath55 .",
    "thus ( iii ) implies ( i ) , and to complete the proof we need only show that ( ii ) implies ( i ) or ( iii ) .",
    "this follows from a quite general argument on information location , the somewhere theorem of @xcite , but can also be shown directly as follows .",
    "the absence of information from @xmath61 implies that if we do a measurement on @xmath63 in any orthonormal basis of @xmath61 , the probabilities of measurement results will be independent of the input state @xmath60 .",
    "consider measuring in the @xmath66 basis .",
    "the probability of the measurement outcome corresponding to @xmath344 @xmath345 is independent of @xmath60 , so @xmath346 is proportional to the identity @xmath347 or , equivalently , @xmath348 is proportional to a unitary operator ( since @xmath348 maps @xmath55 to itself ) .",
    "but the same is true of any kraus operator @xmath349 associated with a different orthonormal basis of @xmath61 .",
    "thus given any two kraus operators , say @xmath350 and @xmath351 , from the original set it follows that @xmath352 and @xmath353 must be proportional to unitaries , and from the fact that @xmath354 , @xmath355 , @xmath356 and @xmath357 are proportional to @xmath347 , we conclude that @xmath358 is also proportional to @xmath347 , so @xmath350 and @xmath351 are both proportional to the same unitary . by applying this argument to every pair one sees that the @xmath348 are of the form specified in ( iii ) .",
    "it is convenient to discuss the schmidt rank and the entangling strength of @xmath9 by mapping them onto properties of an entangled ket @xmath359 in the following manner .",
    "define @xmath360 where @xmath361 and @xmath362 are auxiliary systems isomorphic to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath363 if @xmath364 and likewise @xmath365 are maximally entangled states on @xmath366 and @xmath367 , the schmidt rank of @xmath359 on @xmath80 is equal to that of @xmath9 by the following argument .",
    "the latter can be defined as the number of ( nonzero ) terms @xmath368 in the schmidt operator decomposition @xmath369",
    "satisfying the operator orthogonality conditions @xmath370 inserting in yields @xmath371 given that @xmath372 and @xmath365 are fully entangled it follows that the inner products of kets of the type @xmath373 for different @xmath27 coincide with the operator inner products @xmath374 aside from normalization .",
    "thus is a schmidt decomposition and the schmidt ranks of @xmath359 and @xmath9 coincide .",
    "we are interested in simulating @xmath9 using the entangled resource @xmath375 along with separable operations ( this includes locc ) .",
    "thus there is a quantum operation @xmath376 with @xmath377 , @xmath378 such that for any @xmath379 @xmath380 where the @xmath381 are complex numbers , and the kraus operators satisfy the usual closure condition @xmath382 .",
    "this can be extended in an obvious way to include the auxiliary systems @xmath361 and @xmath362 so that @xmath383 with @xmath384 and @xmath385 .",
    "the schmidt rank of @xmath386 on @xmath387 is the same as @xmath71 on @xmath388 , and multiplying the former by the product operator @xmath389 can not increase it .",
    "thus the schmidt rank of @xmath359 can not exceed that of @xmath71 .",
    "this includes the case discussed previously in which the schmidt rank of @xmath359 is equal to that of @xmath9 .",
    "hence the latter can not exceed the schmidt rank of @xmath71 .",
    "the proof of the second part of the theorem uses the fact that a separable operation applied to a pure state can not increase the average entanglement , see ( v ) in sec .",
    "iii of @xcite , and as the entanglement of @xmath386 on @xmath390 , for any choice of @xmath372 and @xmath365 in , is the same as @xmath71 on @xmath391 , the entanglement of @xmath359 on @xmath392 , and hence the entangling strength of @xmath9 , can not be greater than the entanglement of @xmath71 .",
    "see @xcite , pp .  615 , for a compact discussion of the group fourier transform and references to the literature .",
    "the orthogonality theorem for group representations , which applies to projective as well as ordinary representations ( e.g. ,  @xcite , p.  274 ) , states that @xmath393 where @xmath394 is the unitary matrix representing the group element @xmath129 in the irreducible representation @xmath204 ; note that all these representations belong to the same factor system .",
    "now is equivalent to the assertion that @xmath395 , with @xmath209 , defined by @xmath396 has orthogonal and normalized rows , thus is a unitary matrix .",
    "consequently it is nonsingular ( and the same is true of @xmath207 ) , and its inverse is the matrix @xmath397 .",
    "this allows one to invert after multiplying both sides by @xmath398 , and the result is .",
    "before proving the theorem , we first prove that the @xmath399 s defined in form a projective representation of @xmath10 .",
    "this can be easily checked : @xmath400 where the final equality is a consequence of the associative rule @xmath401 for the factor system .",
    "[ see , e.g. , ch .",
    "12 of  @xcite , where @xmath399 is identified as the projective regular representation . ]",
    "what is important for our purposes is that , just as in the case of ordinary representations , it contains each inequivalent irreducible representation @xmath188 of @xmath10 a number of times equal to @xmath270 .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ thm5 ] begins with the connection of ( iii ) in ( a ) to ( b ) and to ( c ) . from and it follows that @xmath402 thus if the @xmath145 satisfy , @xmath403 , and @xmath9 is unitary . on the other hand , if the @xmath134 are linearly independent , for every @xmath112 the coefficient ( an operator on @xmath5 ) of @xmath138 on the right side of is uniquely determined by the left side , so the unitarity of @xmath9 implies .    the proof of ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) will thus be complete once we show the equivalence of the three statements in ( a ) .",
    "the equivalence of ( i ) and ( iii ) follows from upon replacing @xmath9 in the preceding argument by @xmath150 and @xmath134 by @xmath399 , and noting that the @xmath399 are linearly independent , since for each @xmath129 the right side of involves a unique set of dyads .",
    "that ( i ) implies ( ii ) comes from noting that with @xmath134 replaced by @xmath399 in the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sct4c ] , @xmath150 can be written in the form , and the unitarity of each @xmath228 is a consequence of the unitarity of @xmath150 . thus the @xmath145 are indeed given by for a collection of unitary @xmath228 .",
    "conversely , if holds for some collection of unitary @xmath228 , then @xmath150 expressed in the form will be unitary , so ( ii ) implies ( i ) .    to prove ( d ) , note that by theorem [ thm4 ] if the @xmath134 form a dependent collection , some of the irreducible representations must be missing , and thus @xmath9 determines , through , unitary @xmath228 matrices for only some values of @xmath188 .",
