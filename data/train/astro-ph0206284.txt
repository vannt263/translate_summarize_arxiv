    "the standard picture of solar - type magnetic activity is expected to break down for very - low mass stars : being fully convective throughout the interior they lack the interface between radiative core and convective envelope in which the solar - type @xmath0-dynamo is thought to reside . in spite of these theoretical predictions x - ray and h@xmath1 activity",
    "has been observed on stars with masses below the fully convective boundary , corresponding to spectral type @xmath2m3 ( fleming et  al .",
    "1995 , gizis et  al .",
    "recent h@xmath1 observations of ultracool field dwarfs indicate , however , a decline of activity setting in near the substellar limit at spectral type m9 ( mohanty & basri 2002 , see also basri this volume ) .",
    "while there is a substantial data base on chromospheric activity , only few x - ray observations of very low - mass ( vlm ) field dwarfs have been performed so far .",
    "virtually all of the x - ray emitting field dwarfs with spectral type later than @xmath2 m7 have been detected only during a temporary outburst , with quiescent emission below the detection threshold ( see sect .  3 ) . whether this is due to a lack of sensitivity of the respective observations , or whether these objects indeed are x - ray quiet",
    "can now be tested with a new generation of x - ray instruments onboard _ xmm - newton _ and _",
    "chandra_.    x - ray observations with _ rosat _ have shown that young brown dwarfs ( bds ) are more readily detected than older ones , as they show higher levels of activity ( neuhuser et  al . 1999 ) .",
    "due to the absence of an internal energy source the evolution of bds goes along with a decrease of effective temperature .",
    "the accompanying drop of the ionization fraction may prevent coupling of the gas to the magnetic field , thus shutting off activity .",
    "probing the relation between activity and the evolution of atmospheric conditions requires high - sensitivity x - ray observations of vlm stars and bds at different ages .",
    "in order to examine the dependence of x - ray emission on age and/or effective temperature , we observed two bds in different evolutionary stages : ( a ) the @xmath3myr old bd cfht - pl12 in the pleiades cluster , and ( b ) denisj1228 - 1547 which is a bd binary in the field at an age of @xmath4myr .    the pleiades cluster has been extensively monitored with past and present day x - ray instrumentation ( see sky map in fig .",

    "none of the earlier observations was deep enough to reach into the substellar regime .",
    "in particular the limiting sensitivity of pointed _ rosat _ observations in the pleiades region is @xmath5  erg / s ( stelzer & neuhuser 2001 ) . two long exposures with _ chandra _ included no bds in the field ( krishnamurthi et  al .",

    "is located in a region of the cluster which is widely unexplored in x - rays so far .",
    "cfht - pl12 is the optically brightest of the bd candidates in the pleiades , and its position above the main - sequence in the color - magnitude diagram indicates it could be a binary ( bouvier et  al .",
    "unresolved binaries should have a higher probability of detection , and therefore also denisj1228 - 1547 , a bd binary with @xmath6 separation , is a favorable target for x - ray studies .",
    "the data were analysed using the standard _ xmm - newton _ sas , version 5.3.0 .",
    "strong background flaring restricted the useful exposure time to @xmath7ksec for cfht - pl12 and @xmath8ksec for denisj1228 - 1547 .",
    "source detection was performed in three energy bands in the range from @xmath9 to @xmath10kev using a combination of local , map , and maximum likelihood detection mechanism .",
    "neither cfht - pl12 nor denisj1228 - 1547 are detected at a @xmath11 detection threshold of @xmath12 .",
    "upper limits to the source flux derived under the assumption of a one - temperature , 1kev raymond - smith spectrum plus photo - absorption are listed in table  1 . to facilitate comparison with earlier x - ray observations of vlm objects ,",

    "2 the newly derived upper limit for denisj1228 - 1547 is compared to x - ray observations of other field dwarfs : m - stars from the catalog of nearby stars ( cns ; gliese & jahreiss 1991 ) detected in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( = rass ; data from hnsch et  al .",

    "the _ xmm - newton _ observation of denisj1228 - 1547 presented here is the first attempt to extend the study of x - ray activity into spectral class l. the upper limit derived from the rass is improved by @xmath2 1 order of magnitude for this object despite the considerable loss of observing time ( due to high background ) .",
