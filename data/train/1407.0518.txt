    "the standard jump - diffusion model used for modeling many stochastic processes is an it semimartingale given by the following differential equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are processes with cdlg paths , @xmath5 is a brownian motion and @xmath6 is an it semimartingale process of pure - jump type ( i.e. , semimartingale with zero second characteristic , definition ii.2.6 in @xcite ) .    at high frequencies , provided @xmath4 does not vanish , the dominant component of  @xmath7 is its continuous martingale component and at these frequencies the increments of @xmath7 in ( [ eqxcont ] ) behave like scaled and independent gaussian random variables .",
    "that is , for each fixed @xmath8 , we have the following convergence : @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a brownian motion , and the above convergence is for the skorokhod topology ; see , for example , lemma  1 of @xcite .",
    "there are two distinctive features of the convergence in ( [ eqlg ] ) .",
    "the first is the scaling factor of the increments on the left - hand side of ( [ eqlg ] ) is the square - root of the length of the high - frequency interval , a  feature that has been used in developing tests for presence of diffusion .",
    "the second distinctive feature is that the limiting distribution of the ( scaled ) increments on the right - hand side of ( [ eqlg ] ) is mixed gaussian ( the mixing given by @xmath4 ) .",
    "both these features of the local gaussianity result in ( [ eqlg ] ) for models in ( [ eqxcont ] ) have been key in the construction of essentially all nonparametric estimators of functionals of volatility .",
    "examples include the jump - robust bipower variation of @xcite and the many other alternative measures of powers of volatility summarized in the recent book of @xcite .",
    "another important example is the general approach of @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) where estimators of functions of volatility are formed by utilizing directly ( [ eqlg ] ) and working as if volatility is constant over a block of decreasing length .    despite the generality of the jump - diffusion model in ( [ eqxcont ] ) , however , there are several examples of stochastic processes considered in various applications that are not nested in the model in ( [ eqxcont ] ) .",
    "examples include pure - jump it semimartingales [ i.e. , the model in ( [ eqxcont ] ) with @xmath11 and jumps present ] , semimartingales contaminated with noise or more generally nonsemimartingales . in all these cases ,",
    "both the scaling constant on the left - hand side of ( [ eqlg ] ) as well as the limiting process on the right - hand side of ( [ eqlg ] ) change .",
    "our goal in this paper , therefore , is to derive a limit theory for a feasible version of the local gaussianity result in ( [ eqlg ] ) based on high - frequency record of @xmath12 .",
    "an application of the developed limit theory is a feasible and pivotal test based on kolmogorov  smirnov type distance for the class of it semimartingales with nonvanishing diffusion component .",
    "the result in ( [ eqlg ] ) implies that the high - frequency increments are approximately gaussian , but the key obstacle of testing directly ( [ eqlg ] ) is that the ( conditional ) variance of the increments , @xmath13 , is unknown and further is approximately constant only over a short interval of time .",
    "therefore , on a first step we split the high - frequency increments into blocks ( with length that shrinks asymptotically to zero as we sample more frequently ) and form local estimators of volatility over the blocks .",
    "we then scale the high - frequency increments within each of the blocks by our local estimates of the volatility .",
    "this makes the scaled high - frequency increments approximately i.i.d .",
    "centered normal random variables with unit variance . to purge further the effect of `` big '' jumps",
    ", we then discard the increments that exceed a time - varying threshold ( that shrinks to zero asymptotically ) with time - variation determined by our estimator of the local volatility .",
    "we derive a ( functional ) central limit theorem ( clt ) for the convergence of the empirical c.d.f . of the scaled high - frequency increments ,",
    "not exceeding the threshold , to the c.d.f . of a standard normal random variable .",
    "the rate of convergence can be made arbitrary close to  @xmath14 , by appropriately choosing the rate of increase of the block size , where @xmath15 is the number of high - frequency observations within the time interval .",
    "this is achieved despite the use of the block estimators of volatility , each of which can estimate the spot volatility @xmath4 at a rate no faster than @xmath16 .",
    "we further derive the limit behavior of the empirical c.d.f . described above in two possible alternatives to the model ( [ eqxcont ] ) .",
    "the first is the case where @xmath7 does not contain a diffusive component , that is , the second term in ( [ eqxcont ] ) is absent .",
    "models of these type have received a lot of attention in various fields ; see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second alternative to ( [ eqxcont ] ) is the case in which the it semimartingale is distorted with measurement error . in each of these two cases , the empirical c.d.f . of the scaled high - frequency increments below the threshold",
    "converges to a c.d.f . of a distribution different from the standard normal law",
    "this is the stable distribution in the pure - jump case and the distribution of the noise in the case of it semimartingale observed with error .",
