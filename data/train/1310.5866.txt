    "gravitational microlensing technique initially developed to search for machos ( massive astrophysical compact halo objects ) in the galactic halo by long observational campaigns towards several directions in the sky @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite , has become nowadays a powerful tool to investigate several astrophysical phenomena .",
    "microlensing observations have been used : + @xmath0 to map the amount and distribution of luminous matter in the galaxy , magellanic clouds and m31 galaxy @xcite ; + @xmath0 to carry out detailed studies of different classes of variable stars which actually do change their brightness due to changes in size and temperature @xcite ; + @xmath0 to test stellar atmosphere models via the detection of limb - darkening effects @xcite ; + @xmath0 to discover and fully characterize exoplanetary systems , via the detection of anomalies in the microlensing light - curves expected for single - lens events .",
    "indeed , up to now , 22 planetary systems in the galaxy have been discovered with this technique ( see http://exoplanet.eu ) .",
    "moreover , the anomaly in pixel lensing found in @xcite can be explained with an exoplanetary system in the m31 galaxy @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the possibility that during a microlensing event , depending on the nature of the source star and the parameters of the microlensing event , a characteristic polarization signal of the source star light might arise .",
    "it has already been shown that polarization measurements offer an unique opportunity to probe stellar atmospheres of very distant stars and also to measure the lens einstein radius @xmath1 , if the physical radius @xmath2 of the source is known . moreover , since the polarization curve is sensitive to the presence of lens planetary companions , polarization measurement may help to retrieve the parameters of the binary - lens system .",
    "polarization of the stellar light is caused by photon scattering in the stellar atmospheres of several classes of stars .",
    "in particular : + @xmath0 in the case of hot stars ( o , a , b type ) , light is polarized by thomson scattering on free electrons .",
    "this phenomenon has been completely studied by chandrasekhar @xcite , showing that the linear polarization increases from the center to the star limb , where about 12 per cent of the light is polarized .",
    "however , hot stars are rather rare and , indeed , no source star of this type has been observed as source in microlensing events .",
    "+ @xmath0 in the case of main sequence stars of late type ( g , k , m ) , light is polarized by the coherent rayleigh scattering on neutral hydrogen and molecules @xcite .",
    "these stars constitute the larger fraction of the source stars in microlensing events , but the polarization degree is lower ( about 3 order of magnitude ) with respect to hot star case .",
    "+ @xmath0 in the case of cool giant stars , the stellar light is polarized by photon scattering on dust grains contained in their envelopes powered by large stellar winds @xcite .",
    "cool giant stars constitute a significant fraction of the lensed sources in microlensing events towards the galactic bulge , the lmc and the m31 galaxy .",
    "moreover , the polarization signal is expected to be relevant , particularly for red giants having large dust optical depth .",
    "these source stars are the more valuable candidates for observing a polarization signal during a microlensing event with source stars in the galactic bulge . in this paper",
    "we concentrate particularly on this kind of sources .    a variable polarization across the stellar disk",
    "is currently observed only for the sun @xcite and , as expected , the polarization degree increases from the center to the star limb . in the case of distant stars ,",
    "the stellar disk is not resolved and only the overall polarization is relevant .",
    "this is usually zero , since the flux from each stellar disk element is the same .",
    "a net polarization of the stellar light is produced if some suitable asymmetry is present in the stellar disk due , e.g. , to hot spots , tidal distorsions , eclipses , fast rotation or magnetic fields .    in the microlensing context",
    ", an overall polarization of the stellar light is always present since different parts of the source star disk are differently magnified by the lens system .",
    "moreover , due to the relative motion between source and lens , the gravitational lens scans the disk of the source star giving rise also to a time dependent polarization signal .",
    "the polarization signal will be relevant , and possibly observable , in events with high magnification ( both single lens and binary ) , which also show large finite source effects , namely for events in which the source star radius is of the order or greater than the lens impact parameter .",
    "in a recent work @xcite we considered a specific set of highly magnified , single - lens events and a subset of exoplanetary events observed towards the galactic bulge .",
    "as an illustration , we also considered the expected polarization signal for the pa-99-n2 exoplanetary event towards m31 .",
    "we calculated the polarization profiles as a function of time taking into account the nature of the source stars .",
    "given a @xmath3 band typical magnitude at maximum magnification of about 12 and a duration of the polarization signal up to 1 day , we showed that the currently available technology , in particular the polarimeter in fors2 on the vlt , may potentially allow the detection of such signals .    besides the interest related to stellar astrophysics , the analysis of a polarization profile ( which is related to the underlying magnification light - curve ) may in principle provide independent constraints on the lensing parameters in binary events .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that , given sufficient observational precision , polarization measurements are able to solve a specific type of ambiguity , namely the planet or binary interpretation of anomalies present in microlensing light curves .",
    "the general method is similar to that of @xcite in which the presence in giant stars of resonant lines with intensity increasing from the center to the star limb ( and a variable magnification across the stellar disk ) leads to narrow band ( centered on the resonance line ) stellar fluxes with a two peaks structure .",
    "similarly , we obtain polarization profiles with a double peak structure and the observable time interval between them becomes an important tool to investigate both the source and lens parameters .",
    "high magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detect planets , via the detection of perturbations near the peak of the events .",
    "it is known that these perturbations can be produced by a planet or a binary companion to the primary lens and that both types of solutions can be generally distinguished , due to different magnification patterns around caustics . however , there are cases ( that are expected to be common ) , in which the degeneracy between the planet and binary solution can not be resolved by the analysis of the light curves .",
    "we consider in particular the ogle-2011-blg-0905/moa-2011-blg-336 event case @xcite and we show that the expected polarization curves are different for the planet and binary case , potentially allowing to solve the ambiguity .",
    "of course , since accurate polarization measurements can not be obtained with a survey telescope , alert systems are necessary allowing large telescopes to take polarimetry measurements during a microlensing event .",
    "following the approach outlined in @xcite we define the intensities @xmath4 and @xmath5 emitted by the scattering atmosphere in the direction making an angle @xmath6 with the normal to the star surface and polarized as follows : @xmath4 is the intensity in the plane containing the line of sight and the normal , @xmath5 is the intensity in the direction perpendicular to this plane .",
    "we choose a coordinate system in the lens plane with the origin at the center of mass of the binary system .",
    "the @xmath7 axis is directed towards the observer , the @xmath8 axis is oriented parallel to the binary component separation . the location of a point @xmath9 on the source star surface is determined by the angular distance @xmath10 from the projected position of the source star center @xmath11 and by the angle @xmath12 with the @xmath8 axis ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) . in the above coordinate system @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the angular source radius . here and in the following all angular distances",
    "are given in units of the einstein angular radius @xmath17 of the total lens mass .",
    "to calculate the polarization of a star we integrate the unnormalized stokes parameters and the flux over the star disk @xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the unmagnified star flux , @xmath22 is the point source magnification due to the lens system and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are intensities related to the considered polarization model .    as usual @xcite ,",
    "the polarization degree is @xmath25 and the polarization angle @xmath26 .",
    "since we are dealing with binary events for which the source trajectory may intersect either fold caustics or cusps ( where the lensing magnification of a point source becomes infinite ) , instead of directly solving the lens system equations @xcite , we evaluate the magnification @xmath22 at any point in the source plane by using the inverse ray - shooting method @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the magnification depends on the mass ratio @xmath27 between the binary components and on their projected separation @xmath28 ( in units of the einstein radius @xmath29 ) .",
    "further parameters entering in the above equations are the coordinates @xmath11 of the source star center .",
    "these are given , at any time @xmath30 , in terms of the other lens system parameters , that are : the maximum amplification time @xmath31 , the impact parameter @xmath32 ( which is the minimum distance between source star center and the center of mass of the lens system ) , the einstein time @xmath33 and the angle @xmath34 of the source trajectory with respect to the @xmath8 axis connecting the binary components .",
    "polarization during microlensing of source stars with extended envelopes has been studied for single - lens events @xcite and for binary lensing @xcite . as emphasized in these works ,",
    "the model is well suited to describe polarization in evolved , cool stars that exhibit stellar winds significantly stronger than that of the sun .",
    "the scattering opacity responsible for producing the polarization is the photon scattering on dust grains",
    ". however , since the presence of dust is only possible at radial distances at which the gas temperature is below the dust sublimation temperature @xmath35 k ( depending on the grain composition ) , in our model a circumstellar cavity is considered between the photosphere radius and the condensation radius @xmath36 , where the temperature drops to @xmath37 .",
    "the dust number density distribution is parametrized by a simple power law @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radial distance from the star center , @xmath40 is the dust number density at the radius @xmath36 of the central cavity and @xmath41 is a free parameter depending on the velocity structure of the wind : @xmath42 holds for constant velocity winds while larger values correspond to accelerated winds .",
    "we estimate @xmath36 according to simple energy balance criteria .",
    "we consider the balance between the energy absorbed and emitted by a typical dust grain as a function of the radial distance from the star @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the stellar flux , @xmath45 is the grain absorption efficiency , @xmath46 the dust temperature , @xmath47 the black body emissivity and @xmath48 the dust grain size .",
    "this calculation assumes that the heating by non radiative processes and by the diffuse radiation field is negligible so that we limited ourselves to compute @xmath45 for a typical particle size distribution @xcite with optical constants derived by draine and lee @xcite .",
    "specifically , the numerical value of @xmath36 is obtained by using equation ( [ bilancio ] ) with @xmath49 .",
    "assuming @xmath35 k , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the ratio @xmath50 as a function of the stellar surface temperature @xmath51 .",
    "this figure allows us to derive @xmath36 , once @xmath2 and @xmath51 are given .",
    "the explicit form of the intensities @xmath52 and @xmath53 is given in refs .",
    "it turns out that the polarization @xmath54 linearly depends on the total optical depth @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the scattering cross - section and the scatterers are taken to exist only for @xmath57 .",
    "an estimate of the order of magnitude of @xmath58 is derived assuming a stationary , spherically symmetric stellar wind @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the dust - to - gas mass density ratio , @xmath61 @xmath62 g@xmath63 is the dust opacity at @xmath64  , @xmath65 is the mass - loss rate and @xmath66 the asymptotic wind velocity .    to estimate @xmath58 for cool giant stars , we relate @xmath65 to the stellar parameters of the magnified star .",
    "indeed , it is well known that from main sequence to agb phases , @xmath65 increases by 7 order of magnitude @xcite . by performing numerical simulations of the mass loss of intermediate and low - mass stars",
    ", it was shown that @xmath67 obeys to the relation @xmath68 for the more common stars evolving from main sequence to red giant star phases , @xmath65 values in the range @xmath69 are expected .",
    "this corresponds , from eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) to values of @xmath58 in the range @xmath70 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]",
    "in the following we focus in particular on the event ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336 . this high magnification event presents central perturbations in the light curve that may be caused either by a binary lens ( model a ) or a planetary lens ( model b ) @xcite .",
    "however , by simply fitting the light curve , it is not possible to distinguish between the two solutions and this gives rise to a specific degeneracy in the parameter space . in figs . 1 and 2 of the above mentioned paper the degeneracy of the solutions is fully described . despite the basically different caustic shapes and the resulting magnification patterns of the two solutions , the source trajectory in both cases is crossing ( with different angles ) the regions of _ negative _ perturbation in such a way that the morphology of the resulting perturbations are the same .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are summarized in table [ table ] and the simulated event light - curves ( almost identical for the two models a and b ) are shown in the fig .",
    "[ curvadiluce ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for the model a , we show simulated polarization curves @xmath71 ( in units of @xmath58 ) evaluated by fixing the best - fit binary parameters given in table [ table ] and varying the polarization model parameters @xmath41 and @xmath36 values .",
    "a typical polarization curve has two maxima and one minimum , bracketed by the maxima , which coincides with the instant @xmath31 of maximum amplification .",
    "similar results ( not shown ) are obtained for the model b. the polarization signal gets the maximum when the condensation radius @xmath36 ( the radius of the central cavity in the stellar atmosphere ) enters and exits the lensing region .",
    "two peaks appear at symmetrical position with respect to @xmath31 and the characteristic time scale @xmath72 between them is related to the _ transit _ duration of the central cavity @xmath73    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( upper panel , where @xmath74 ) , we explore the effect on the polarization signal of varying the parameter @xmath41",
    ". as one can see , the maximum polarization value increases with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "this behavior is expected since the dust density gradient across @xmath36 ( which is _ transiting _ the lensing region ) increases with increasing @xmath41 and this has the effect to reinforce the asymmetry across the stellar atmosphere which , ultimately , is at the origin of the polarization signal for cool giant stars .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we fix @xmath75 , shows that for increasing @xmath36 values the distance between the two maxima increases . the effect is present in the polarization curves ( not shown ) evaluated for different @xmath41 values .    from these results",
    "it is evident that the only relevant model parameter is @xmath36 , which is directly related to the observable time interval @xmath72 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ transittime ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 , related to the wind acceleration mechanism , remains instead largely undetermined , since it does not exist an observable uniquely related to it .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , by taking as an illustration @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we compare the expected polarization profiles for the best - fit models a and b in the ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336 event .",
    "the position of the two maxima is different and such difference remains for any selected values of @xmath41 and @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , an independent determination of @xmath36 , based ( as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ) on a direct observation of the source star temperature @xmath51 and the determination of the source radius @xmath2 ( through the best - fit to the event light - curve ) , allows us to distinguish the two models a and b , namely the binary or planetary solution to the lens system .",
    "actually , in the case of the considered event ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336 , the radius and the surface temperature of the source are unconstrained by observations and therefore our analysis of the simulated polarization profiles remains an exercise that , anyhow , shows the potentiality of the method .",
    "we emphasize that the detection of the polarization signals in forthcoming microlensing events is technically reachable , as already noted in @xcite .",
    "however , to that aim , it is necessary to select , among all microlensing events , the class of the highly magnified events that also show large finite size source effects , in particular events with source stars belonging to the class of cool , giant stars @xcite .",
    "these evolved stars have both large radii ( giving rise to relevant finite size source effects ) and large stellar atmospheres , where the light get polarized by photon scattering on dust grains . for these events ,",
    "hopefully , the dust optical dept @xmath58 could be @xmath77 so that the polarization signals @xmath78 could be detectable , due to both the high brightness at maximum and the large time duration of the polarization signal",
    ". this observational programme may take advantage of the currently available surveys plus follow up strategy already routinely used for microlensing monitoring towards the galactic bulge ( aimed at the detection of exoplanets ) . in particular , this allows one to predict in advance for which events and at which exact time instant the observing resources may be focused to make intensive polarization measurements .",
    "we conclude by noting that polarization measurements in a binary microlensing event ( ogle-2012-blg-0798 ) have been performed recently .",
    "the data analysis , with the aim of distinguish among the several models that give a good fit of the observed light curve , is at present in progress @xcite .",
