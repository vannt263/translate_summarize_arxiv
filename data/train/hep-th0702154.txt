    "over the past decade observations of the microwave background temperature anisotropy have revealed that the large scale structure in our universe originates from primordial perturbations that are nearly scale - invariant , adiabatic and gaussian .",
    "since these coincide with the predictions of the simplest inflationary models , this is widely regarded as evidence for inflation .",
    "however this does not constitutes a proof , and it is prudent to keep in mind that the seeds for structure formation could originate from a different mechanism .",
    "ultimately our faith in inflation must rely on the absence of a compelling alternative paradigm .    in this paper",
    ", we present a fully consistent and complete scenario of early universe cosmology which produces a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of density fluctuations without invoking a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "the model is strongly inspired by and borrows key ingredients from ekpyrotic  @xcite and cyclic  @xcite cosmology , in particular the idea that density perturbations are generated during a slow contracting phase prior to the big bang . a key difference , however , is that the cosmological evolution is now completely non - singular and avoids any big crunch singularity .",
    "moreover , perturbations remain in the linear regime throughout .",
    "thus , entirely at the level of a 4d effective theory , we are able to produce a scale - invariant spectrum of density fluctuations , track its evolution through the reversal from contraction to expansion , and its transmission to the matter - radiation fluid at the onset of the hot expanding phase .",
    "the idea of a contracting phase prior to the big bang originated in pre - big bang cosmology .",
    "density perturbations and the evolution from the contracting to the expanding phase have been discussed in this context .",
    "see  @xcite for a review .",
    "the key ingredient in ekpryosis is a scalar field rolling down a negative , nearly exponential potential .",
    "if the coefficient in the exponent is sufficiently large , then , as the scalar field rolls down the potential , its fluctuations acquire a nearly scale - invariant spectrum spanning 60 e - foldings in comoving wavenumber  @xcite .",
    "since the potential energy is negative , this occurs in a slowly contracting friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) geometry and , hence , with a rapidly decreasing hubble radius . in some sense",
    "this ekpyrotic phase is `` dual '' to inflationary cosmology  @xcite , which , in contrast , is a period of exponential expansion with nearly constant hubble radius .",
    "the difference in dynamics , however , leads to a distinguishing observational prediction : the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum is nearly scale - invariant , whereas that of ekpyrosis is not  @xcite . in ekpyrotic theories ,",
    "the gravitational wave spectrum is strongly blue and , hence , the amplitude is exponentially suppressed on all observable scales  @xcite .",
    "an important obstruction facing ekpyrotic theory is how to `` bounce '' from the contracting phase to an expanding phase , which requires a violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "this is no small feat , however , since non - singular theories that violate the nec generally suffer from violent instabilities , such as ghosts or tachyons of arbitrarily large mass  @xcite . in the big bang / big crunch",
    "ekpyrotic scenario of  @xcite , as well as in the cyclic model  @xcite , one therefore allows the flrw space - time to crunch , invoking stringy effects to effectively violate the nec and generate a smooth bounce .",
    "this is motivated by the relative mildness of the singularity  @xcite .",
    "( understood , for example , as a collision of end - of - the - world branes in heterotic @xmath0-theory  @xcite , only the fifth dimension shrinks to zero size while the 3 large dimensions remain finite . ) despite considerable effort in string theory  @xcite and compelling physical arguments  @xcite , there is still no proof that a bounce is possible .",
    "recently , however , nec - violating solutions  @xcite have been derived in the context of ghost condensation  @xcite .",
    "since these models involve higher - derivative kinetic terms , they evade the assumptions of  @xcite and therefore yield ghost - free solutions .    in this paper",
    ", we show explicitly how the nec - violating ghost condensate can be merged consistently with the preceding ekpyrotic phase to generate a non - singular bouncing cosmology .",
    "this merger involves many subtleties .",
    "for instance , since the energy density of an nec - violating fluid grows in an expanding universe , whereas everything else redshifts , it quickly comes to dominate the universe .",
    "but in a contracting universe precisely the opposite happens : the nec - violating component goes to zero while any amount of radiation or scalar kinetic energy blueshifts . thus achieving a bounce",
    "hinges on an efficient transfer of energy from the ekpyrotic scalar , which dominates during the ekpyrotic phase , to the ghost condensate , which achieves the bounce .",
    "to realize this we therefore propose that they are , in fact , one and the same field .",
    "the higher - derivative kinetic function is chosen to be nearly canonical during the ekpyrotic phase , while higher derivatives become relevant only as we approach the bounce .",
    "this translates into consistency relations between the kinetic function and the scalar potential , which we derive explicitly .",
    "we argue that these conditions are realized for a wide class of kinetic functions and scalar potentials .",
    "armed with a non - singular cosmological evolution , we can address the propagation of density perturbations through the bounce , an issue that has stirred a lot of controversy over the past few years  @xcite .",
    "although the fluctuations in the scalar field and the gauge - invariant newtonian potential are scale - invariant , it turns out that their growing mode precisely cancels out of @xmath1  the curvature perturbation on uniform - density hypersurfaces  @xcite .",
    "the latter is a useful variable to track since it is conserved on super - horizon scales , in the absence of entropy perturbations .",
    "thus , as long as 4d general relativity is valid , @xmath1 remains constant independent of the physics of the bounce . in the context of the big bang / big crunch",
    "ekpyrotic or cyclic models , however , 4d gravity must break down near the singularity and therefore the issue of what happens to @xmath1 remains unresolved .",
    "some maintain that the likely matching condition is for @xmath1 to be continuous , most convincingly  @xcite , while others argue that higher - dimensional effects near the singularity could lead to mode - mixing and endow @xmath1 with a scale - invariant contribution  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one must also deal with the fact that this mode diverges logarithmically near the singularity , resulting in a breakdown of perturbation theory , although matching prescriptions based on analytic continuation have been proposed  @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "the evolution is completely non - singular and , hence , the outcome of the perturbations is unambiguous : @xmath1 is conserved . to generate a scale - invariant spectrum we rely instead on a recently proposed mechanism using entropy perturbations  @xcite . for earlier and closely related work ,",
    "see  @xcite . if we have two scalar fields , each rolling down a steep , negative , and nearly exponential potential , then each of them acquires a scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations , as described earlier .",
    "moreover , the entropy perturbation  corresponding to the difference in the scalar fluctuations  is also scale - invariant  @xcite . by converting this entropy perturbation into the adiabatic mode ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 ) , the curvature perturbation thus becomes scale - invariant long before the bounce . in the inflationary context , the idea of using a spectator field to generate a scale - invariant spectrum of entropy perturbations , later to be imprinted on the adiabatic mode , was also considered in the curvaton  @xcite and modulon scenarios  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a concrete realization of the entropy generation mechanism .",
    "we consider two ekpyrotic scalar fields , each with its own negative potential and its own higher - derivative kinetic function . as",
    "the fields roll down their respective potentials , the entropy perturbation acquires a scale - invariant spectrum . to convert this spectrum into the adiabatic mode",
    ", we assume that the ekpyrotic potentials are such that one field exits the ekpyrotic phase and enters the ghost condensation regime before the other .",
    "more precisely , the potential in the ekpyrotic phase is steep and negative , as mentioned earlier , while in the ghost condensate phase it must be positive .",
    "thus this transition is marked by a sharp rise in the potential .",
    "if the potentials are such that one field hits the transition before the other , this will result in a sharp turn in the trajectory in field space , and in the process @xmath1 will acquire a scale - invariant piece from the entropy perturbation .",
    "we calculate the resulting @xmath1 explicitly and find an expression that closely resembles its inflationary counterpart .",
    "this confirms earlier claims that the required level of tuning on the ekpyrotic potential is comparable to that in inflation .    for _ exact _ exponential potentials ,",
    "we find that the resulting spectral tilt is slightly  blue \" , which at first sight is disturbing in light of the recent wmap evidence for a small  red \" tilt .",
    "however , we show that deviations from the pure exponential form can lead to a small red tilt .",
    "see also  @xcite for an independent derivation .",
    "this is shown explicitly in the case that the potentials for the two scalar fields are identical , albeit not exactly exponentials .",
    "this simplification is made only to facilitate the analysis , and we do not believe that the resulting red tilt hinges on it . in this limit",
    "we derive an exact evolution equation for the entropy perturbation , cast entirely in terms of the background equation of state , which closely resembles analogous results in inflation  @xcite and old ( single - field ) ekpyrotic theory  @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectral tilt acquires a dependence on the degree of departure from pure exponential form , and , in particular , can be red .",
    "coming back to the background evolution , one of the potential dangers with contracting universes is that the flrw background is unstable to the onset of chaotic mixmaster behavior  @xcite . in  @xcite it was shown that mixmaster behavior is suppressed if the dominant energy component has equation of state @xmath2 , as is the case in the ekpyrotic contracting phase . in singular ekpyrotic theories ,",
    "as the universe approaches the singularity the equation of state must eventually revert to @xmath3 , and mixmaster behavior can potentially resurface . a necessary condition to avoid a chaotic bounce",
    "is that the anisotropy and curvature components be exponentially suppressed at the onset of the @xmath3 phase so that they remain subdominant all the way to the string or planck scale , where 4d gravity breaks down anyway .",
    "mixmaster issues also apply to our new scenario but are trivially satisfied since the bounce is non - singular .",
    "the @xmath2 ekpyrotic phase exponentially suppresses anisotropy and curvature components .",
    "the latter grow again during the nec - violating phase , but only by an insignificant amount since the bounce occurs within one e - fold of contraction .    to summarize , our scenario is a complete and unambiguous template for early universe cosmology .",
    "it provides an alternative explanation for the origin of the seeds of structure formation in which perturbations are generated long before the bounce , all within a singularity - free and finite flrw background . the bounce is entirely described at the level of a consistent effective theory , which is free of ghost - like instabilities or other pathologies .",
    "mixmaster behavior is trivially avoided .",
    "perturbations remain in the linear regime , and their evolution can be tracked through the bounce . since 4d",
    "gravity remains valid throughout , the curvature perturbation @xmath1 goes through unscathed . and since @xmath1 acquires a scale - invariant spectrum long before the bounce , thanks to the entropy perturbation conversion mechanism , it is unequivocally scale - invariant after the transition .",
    "the universe therefore emerges in a hot big bang phase , endowed with a super - horizon spectrum of scale - invariant fluctuations .",
    "while the approach presented here is closely related to and borrows key elements of the original ekpyrotic scenario  @xcite , our new scenario resolves all of its short - comings , such as generating a bounce .",
    "it also resolves the important issues of singularity - avoidance and the fate of the perturbations that occurs in  @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , we call it `` new ekpyrotic cosmology '' .",
    "as it stands the new ekpyrotic scenario is precisely that , a scenario . in principle",
    ", it might be implemented in various ways in different fundamental theories of particle physics .",
    "that being said , this scenario maintains the motivations of the original ekpyrotic model  @xcite , namely , as the cosmology associated with the singularity free collision of a bulk five - brane  @xcite in heterotic m - theory with the observable boundary wall .",
    "indeed , we have computed the potential in such a theory and find that it can satisfy many of the constraints required in the new ekpyrotic model .",
    "this potential will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a further motivation is that a realistic matter spectrum can appear on the observable wall of such theories , see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite .",
    "hence , our scenario can potentially occur in a realistic context . more generally , we emphasize that , with the exception of the so - called no - scale theories , a supersymmetric minimum in the scalar space of any 4d @xmath4 supergravity theory , including effective low energy superstring theories , has a negative cosmological constant .",
    "this can remain true in the presence of flux and non - perturbative effects , even for a vacuum that breaks supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore , potentials consistent with ekpyrotic cosmology , _",
    "i.e. _ , where scalars roll down a steep negative potential energy , appear naturally in this context .",
    "a more pressing question is whether a ghost condensate can occur in string theory .",
    "it has been argued that this is impossible given the known analytic properties of the string s - matrix  @xcite .",
    "see  @xcite , however , for a recent attempt to overcome these difficulties . without question higher derivative interactions do occur in string theories , but whether they are of the requisite form is an open issue .",
    "ultimately a non - singular bounce might arise from very different physics , unrelated to string theory .",
    "in fact , the nec could conceivably be smoothly violated by a different mechanism than ghost condensation .",
    "be that as it may , many of our results would continue to apply to any such mechanism .",
    "the rationale for focusing here on the ghost condensate is to provide an explicit and complete realization of our new scenario .    in sec .",

    "[ conclude ] provides some concluding remarks .",
    "at the level of a 4d effective description , the basic ingredients of the simplest ekpyrotic scenario are essentially the same as in inflation , namely a scalar field @xmath5 rolling down some self - interaction potential @xmath6 . a key difference , however , is that while inflation requires a flat and positive potential , its ekpyrotic counterpart is _ steep _ and _ negative_. this has a dramatic impact on the cosmological evolution . instead of accelerated expansion ,",
    "an ekpyrotic theory has slow contraction . instead of an exponentially growing scale factor and nearly constant hubble radius , corresponding to approximate de sitter geometry",
    ", we now have a nearly constant scale factor and rapidly shrinking hubble radius , corresponding to approximately flat space .",
    "a generic ekpyrotic potential , shown in fig .",
    "[ pot ] , consists qualitatively of three parts . in the region denoted by  ( a ) ,",
    "the potential must be steep and negative . as the field rolls down this part of the potential ,",
    "there is a scaling solution , which is an attractor , corresponding to very slow contraction .",
    "it is also during this phase that large - scale density fluctuations are generated as modes exit the horizon . as we will review later , in order for the spectrum to be nearly scale - invariant , the potential must satisfy the `` fast - roll '' conditions  @xcite : 1;||1 , where m_pl^-2()^2 ; 1- , [ fastroll ] are fast - roll parameters , in analogy with the standard slow - roll parameters in inflation and @xmath7 . ] . here",
    "@xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the `` reduced '' planck mass : @xmath10 gev .",
    "these conditions respectively require the potential to be steep and nearly exponential , and thus region  ( a ) of the potential can be approximated by v()-v_0(- ) , [ expneg ] with @xmath11 .",
    "much as inflation ends when the flatness condition breaks down , here as well the scaling behavior terminates once equations  ( [ fastroll ] ) are no longer satisfied . in order to avoid being left with a large negative vacuum energy at the end of the ekpyrotic phase ,",
    "let us assume that the potential has a minimum and rises back up towards positive values , as shown in region  ( b ) of fig . 1 .",
    "there is considerable freedom in specifying the shape of the potential further to the left of the minimum , that is , in region ( c ) .",
    "since it is in this region that the universe reverses from contraction to expansion , the detailed shape of the potential is dependent on the explicit mechanism producing the bounce . in this paper",
    ", we will use ghost condensation to generate a non - singular bounce where all instabilities are under control . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ ghostcond ] , this requires a flat and positive potential in region ( c ) , as sketched in fig.1 .",
    "the ekpyrotic phase occurs as the field rolls down the steep , negative exponential part of the potential ; region ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ pot ] . in this paper",
    ", we take the background geometry to be a homogeneous , isotropic friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time which is spatially flat .",
    "that is , @xmath12 furthermore , in this section , @xmath5 is chosen to have canonical kinetic energy and no higher derivative interactions",
    ". the equations of motion are then given as usual by the friedmann equation , 3h^2m_pl^2 = ^2 + v ( ) , as well as the evolution equation for the scalar field : + 3h = -v _ , .",
    "[ phieom ]    for the potential  ( [ expneg ] ) , it is easily seen that these equations allow for an exact scaling solution  @xcite & & a(t)~(-t)^p;h = ; + & & ( t ) = m_pl(- t ) , [ scaling1 ] where @xmath13 is negative and increases towards zero .",
    "hence the solution describes a slowly contracting universe . since @xmath11",
    ", we see that the kinetic and potential energy of the scalar are both large in magnitude , but nearly cancel each other to yield a small total energy density . in other words , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "this scaling solution , moreover , has the desirable property that it is an attractor .",
    "indeed , the scalar field has the equation of state of a very stiff fluid : w = -11 .",
    "this means that its energy density behaves as @xmath16 .",
    "but since @xmath11 , this energy component _ blueshifts _ much more rapidly than any other relevant contribution to the friedmann equation .",
    "any curvature ( @xmath17 ) , matter ( @xmath18 ) , radiation ( @xmath19 ) , or anisotropy ( @xmath20 ) component , for instance , quickly becomes subdominant to the scalar field energy density .",
    "incidentally , this is precisely analogous to inflation where the scalar potential gives a nearly constant source in the friedmann equation .",
    "such a term therefore redshifts much more slowly than any of the aforementioned relevant contributions , which is why accelerated expansion is an attractor .      by far the most important feature of a negative exponential potential",
    ", however , is that it generates a scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations in the scalar field , even when the gravitational interactions are turned off . indeed , in the absence of gravity ,  ( [ phieom ] )",
    "can be integrated trivially : = - , where we have set the total energy to zero . for the pure exponential potential  ( [ expneg ] ) , the solution is -t = _ -^d = m_pl = .",
    "[ tsoln ] now fluctuations in the scalar field satisfy the perturbed equation _ k + ( k^2 + v_,)_k = 0 , which , using  ( [ tsoln ] ) , can be written as _ k + ( k^2 - ) _ k = 0 .",
    "[ pert ] this describes a harmonic oscillator with a time - dependent mass . assuming standard bunch - davies boundary conditions  @xcite , @xmath21 as @xmath22 , the general solution for the mode functions is given by a hankel function of the first kind : @xmath23 . in the long - wavelength limit , @xmath24 ,",
    "this gives _",
    "k^2~k^-3 , corresponding to a scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "scale invariance can be traced back to the factor of 2 coefficient in the time - dependent term in  ( [ pert ] ) .",
    "remarkably , from  ( [ tsoln ] ) we see that this holds for any @xmath25 .",
    "when we include gravitational interactions , however , we will find that scale invariance requires @xmath11 .",
    "turning on gravity , the gauge - invariant variable that faithfully reproduces the above scale - invariant spectrum is the newtonian potential @xmath26 , the scalar metric fluctuation in newtonian gauge .",
    "it is convenient to do the analysis in terms of a related gauge - invariant variable , @xmath27 , where primes denote differentiation with respect to conformal time @xmath28 .",

    "is @xmath31 , corresponding to a slight red tilt . for more general potentials ,",
    "the expression for @xmath32 in terms of the fast roll parameters  ( [ fastroll ] ) closely resembles its slow - roll counterpart in inflation : n_s - 1 = -4(+ ) .",
    "[ single ] in particular , potentials with non - trivial @xmath33 , characterizing deviations from pure exponential , can lead to a blue tilt .",
    "the nearly static nature of the geometry during this ekpyrotic phase is underscored by the fact that only a few e - folds of contraction are needed to generate 60 e - folds worth of perturbations .",
    "the comoving wavenumber for any given mode is related as usual to the moment of horizon crossing by @xmath34 . letting @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote respectively the initial and final time during which perturbations are generated , we therefore have e^60 = ~()^1-p~()^(1-p)/p .",
    "since the spectral tilt is constrained observationally to be within 5% of exact scale - invariance , we have @xmath37 , and therefore ( ) 3/2 . [ smalln ]",
    "thus , in contrast with inflation where the universe grows exponentially big as the relevant range of modes is generated , here the universe only shrinks by a factor of order unity .      while @xmath38 is all we need to specify the scalar metric perturbations , it is useful to keep track of another gauge - invariant variable @xmath1  the curvature perturbation on uniform - density hypersurfaces .",
    "this variable has the virtue of being constant on super - horizon scales , since there is no entropy perturbation in this single - field case .",
    "thus , the large - scale spectrum of @xmath1 calculated during the scaling phase automically agrees with the spectrum at horizon re - entry after reheating .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that the scale - invariant growing mode of @xmath26 calculated above precisely projects out of @xmath1 .",
    "since the two are related by = ( )  , it is easy to check using  ( [ usoln ] ) and the background solution that the newtonian potential precisely behaves as @xmath39 on large scales , leaving @xmath1 with an unnacceptably strong blue tilt .",
    "this cancelation is at the core of all the controversy about the ekpyrotic spectrum of perturbations .    while the derivation is rigorous , the conclusion is not without caveats .",
    "a crucial assumption is that the physics of the bounce from contraction to expansion all lies within the regime of validity of 4d effective theory , since the statement about @xmath1 remaining constant relies on the equations of 4d gravity and matter .",
    "the possibility that higher - dimensional effects relevant at the bounce could imprint a scale - invariant contribution to @xmath1 has been the subject of ample literature  @xcite .    in this work , however , we shall exploit an alternative possibility relying on two scalar fields and based on an observation by n.  turok  @xcite and work of lehners , mcfadden , steinhardt and turok  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was suggested by  @xcite and exploited in  @xcite .",
    "namely , with two scalar fields each rolling down their steep exponential potential , the entropy perturbation acquires a scale - invariant spectrum on large scales .",
    "if this can subsequently be imprinted onto @xmath1 , then @xmath1 is endowed with a scale - invariant spectrum well before the bounce . after reviewing the mechanism of  @xcite",
    ", we will show how the entropy perturbation imprints a scale - invariant contribution to @xmath1 if one of the two fields reaches the minimum of its potential ( region b ) of fig .",

    "since this field loses much kinetic energy in the process , this corresponds to a sharp turn in the trajectory in field space , and triggers a scale - invariant jump in @xmath1 .",
    "then , by the same argument as above , whatever bounce physics comes into play to reverse contraction to expansion , as long as everything remains 4d and perturbative , the scale - invariant @xmath1 will go through unscathed .",
    "remarkably , the scaling solution described above generalizes to two fields  @xcite . consider two scalars @xmath5 and @xmath40 , each with a potential of the form shown in fig .  [ pot ] . in region",
    "( a ) we can approximate the scalar potential as a sum of exponentials , generally with different powers @xmath11 and @xmath41 : v ( , ) = -v_0(- ) - u_0(- ) .",
    "[ v2field ] furthermore , we continue to assume that each scalar field has canonical kinetic energy and that there are no higher derivative interactions .",

    "[ scaling2 ] unlike the single - field case , however , the above solution is not an attractor because of an instability in the direction orthogonal to the field trajectory .",

    "precisely at the onset of nec violation , however , corresponding @xmath165 ,  ( [ pieom ] ) reduces to @xmath166 . hence to proceed to the nec - violating phase , we need @xmath167 .",

    "[ pot ] .    in this subsection",
    "we have shown that the scalar potential in the ghost condensate regime must be positive , flat , and have negative slope .",
    "the last condition follows from our choice that @xmath169 at the ghost condensate point , to be consistent with the field motion during the ekpyrotic phase .",
    "a key approximation that must hold throughout the nec - violating phase and through the bounce for perturbation theory to apply is m^2 .",
    "[ condpi ] to see what this entails on the potential and kinetic function , let us combine  ( [ dothpi ] ) ,  ( [ vlin ] ) and  ( [ fried ] ) to obtain the master equation m_pl^2(3h^2 + 2 ) = ^4(1 + t ) ^4 , [ master ] valid to leading order in @xmath144 . in the last step",
    "we have further assumed that @xmath170 for the period of interest , as we will prove shortly .",
    "now , since @xmath171 , the condition  ( [ condpi ] ) is most stringent when @xmath67 is maximal .",
    "evidently this occurs at the bounce itself , when @xmath112 , and thus @xmath172 .",
    "translated in terms of @xmath144 , it follows that a necessary condition for  ( [ condpi ] ) to be satisfied is ^4 m^4k .",
    "[ lambcond ] but then , looking back at  ( [ fried ] ) , this immediately implies that the hubble rate is also constrained throughout the ghost condensation phase : h .",
    "there is one further condition , namely  ( [ duration ] ) , having to do with the suppression of jeans - like instabilities during the bounce . to see what it implies ,",
    "let us introduce the dimensionless parameters = h , = t , [ master2 ] in terms of which  ( [ master ] ) takes the simplified form 2 + 3 ^ 2=1 + .",
    "[ master3 ]    in terms of these dimensionless variables , the condition  ( [ duration ] ) is just @xmath173 .",

    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the result of numerically integrating  ( [ master3 ] ) for @xmath174 .",
    "the initial conditions are such that @xmath152 at the beginning , ensuring that all instabilities are under control .",
    "these conditions lead to a nec - violating phase , followed by a bounce .",

    "we will see further on that @xmath123 has to be small , therefore  ( [ zh3 ] ) generically implies that @xmath5 moves by a small distance compared to the planck mass during the ghost condensate phase . incidentally , note from  ( [ vlin ] ) that the variation of @xmath143 is then of order @xmath179 , and thus @xmath143 changes by a factor of order one in the process .",
    "this justifies the approximation made in  ( [ master ] ) .",
    "to summarize , perturbation theory around the ghost condensate is valid throughout provided that the scale @xmath0 of the kinetic function is much greater than that of the potential as well as the hubble parameter .",
    "furthermore , in order to keep gradient instabilities under control , we have shown that the parameter @xmath159 characterizing the slope of the potential must be of order unity .",
    "these conditions are easily satisfied for a wide class of potentials and kinetic functions .",
    "it was explicitly shown that this yields a non - singular bounce .",
    "let us now focus on the transition as the field passes through region  ( b ) .",
    "since this corresponds to the transition between the ekpyrotic phase and the ghost - condensate bouncing phase , we will find consistency relations between the kinetic function @xmath126 and the scalar potential @xmath6 .    as we did when discussing perturbations , we model this transition as instantaneous compared to a hubble time .",
    "this is justified since , just before reaching @xmath180 , the field obeys the scaling solution and , therefore , is moving rapidly on a hubble time , as shown by  ( [ scaling1 ] ) : ^2 = h^2 .",
    "if the rise in @xmath143 is sufficiently sharp , then @xmath5 will indeed reach the plateau in a very short time compared to the hubble time . in this case",
    "we can treat @xmath85 as constant during this transition , by energy conservation .",
    "let us denote it by @xmath181 .",
    "then , from  ( [ scaling1 ] ) we obtain m^2_plh_min^2 = -v_min - pv_min .",
    "[ hmin ] of course this is expected since @xmath182 during the ekpyrotic phase .",
    "once we reach the plateau , the assumption is that the field is near the ghost condensate point .",
    "we will see that this constrains @xmath180 to lie within some parametric window .",
    "first , to derive an upper bound , we start from the friedmann equation  ( [ fried ] ) at the onset of the ghost phase : 3h^2_minm_pl^2 - + ^4 . substituting  ( [ hmin ] ) and rearranging ,",
    "we get m^2(+ ) . now",
    "a consistency condition for being near the ghost condensate point is that @xmath183 , as we recall from  ( [ condpi ] ) .",
    "since we already know that @xmath184 from  ( [ lambcond ] ) , it immediately follows that v_min .",
    "[ upper ]    to derive a lower bound , note that by assumption we must have @xmath185 during the ekpyrotic process , since @xmath126 has to be approximately linear corresponding to canonical kinetic energy .",
    "however , we also know that @xmath186 during the scaling phase , and therefore v m^4 [ lower1 ] throughout ekpyrosis .",
    "since at this phase @xmath143 is monotonous we have to require v_ek m^4 , [ lower2 ] where @xmath187 is the value of the potential at the onset of the ekpyrosis .",
    "let us relate @xmath188 and @xmath187 through the number of e - folds @xmath189 .",
    "since during ekpyrosis the scale factor @xmath190 stays approximately constant , the number of e - folds is @xmath191 hence , from the solution  ( [ scaling1 ] ) it follows that @xmath192 equations  ( [ upper ] ) , ( [ lower2 ] ) and  ( [ zh2 ] ) together imply that @xmath180 must lie within the range m^4e^2n v_min .",
    "[ range ] noting that @xmath189 is 60 or so , this requires @xmath123 to be less than @xmath0 by many orders of magnitude .",
    "since these two scales are physically different , the above allowed range can be substantially broad .",
    "indeed , from the above considerations , @xmath0 denotes the cutoff scale by which all higher - derivative terms are suppressed , whereas @xmath123 sets the expectation value of @xmath52 at the minimum of @xmath126 .",
    "incidentally , the upper bound is , in fact , conservative since it follows from the relatively strict requirement that the field be near the ghost condensate point by the time it reaches the plateau .",
    "more general transitions will therefore loosen this bound .    to summarize , in order for the field to land in the vicinity of the ghost condensate point at the end of the ekpyrotic phase",
    ", the minimum of the potential , @xmath180 , must lie within the above range .",
    "the lower bound comes from the requirement that the kinetic energy of @xmath5 is approximately canonical and , thus , is large comparing to @xmath123 . on the other hand it can not be too large .",
    "otherwise by the time @xmath5 reaches the plateau its kinetic function @xmath126 will not be near the condensation point .",
    "since @xmath123 , @xmath0 , @xmath180 and @xmath193 are free parameters at the level of model - building , we see that these conditions are satisfied for a wide class of models .",
    "we conclude with a few words on the generalization to two fields , which is straightforward . essentially both @xmath5 and @xmath40 are assumed to have qualitatively the same @xmath126 and the same qualitative shape for their potentials .",
    "both fields will reach their respective @xmath180 more or less at the same time and will proceed to their respective ghost condensate point .",
    "( of course these transitions can not happen simultaneously since our mechanism for converting entropy to adiabatic perturbations relies on one field reaching @xmath180 before the other",
    ". nevertheless this time delay could be negligible compared to a hubble time , for instance . )",
    "once both fields have reaches their ghost condensate points , both act as nec - violating fluids and drive the universe towards a non - singular big bounce .",
    "after a non - singular bounce has been successfully completed , the energy in the ghost condensate must somehow get converted into matter and radiation degrees of freedom in order to reheat the universe .",
    "we briefly comment on two possible reheating mechanisms , one entirely at the level of a 4d effective theory , the other inspired by the original ekpyrotic scenario and concepts of heterotic m - theory .",
    "let us start with the 4d effective mechanism , which has been mentioned in the ghost inflation context  @xcite .",
    "after the bounce , most of the energy of the ghost condensate is stored in its potential energy  the kinetic energy is proportional to @xmath194 , which is small near the ghost condensate point . to trigger reheating",
    ", one assumes that at some field value the scalar potential displays a precipitous drop towards zero , after which it becomes flat again .",
    "when the field reaches the drop , its kinetic energy will be greatly perturbed away from the ghost condensate point .",
    "if @xmath5 is coupled to matter fields , this non - adiabatic process will excite matter and radiation degrees of freedom .",
    "in other words , the potential energy difference reheats the universe . at the end of the reheating phase , the scalar field settles back to the ghost condensate point , but with negligible residual energy . reheating by this mechanism",
    "is easily achieved within the context of the new ekpyrotic scenario .",
    "much more speculative , the second mechanism is inspired by the original ekpyrotic scenario . here , the ekpyrotic scalar field has the geometrical interpretation of the distance between a bulk m5 brane and the observable end - of - the - world boundary brane .",
    "reheating occurs when the bulk brane inelastically collides and is absorbed by the boundary brane .",
    "this fusion proceeds through a ",
    "small instanton \" transition , during which the nature of the light degrees of freedom can change ; greatly increasing , for example , the number of massless scalar fields at the collision . in the context of new ekpyrosis , higher - derivative corrections to the m5-brane modulus kinetic term could generate a ghost condensate point , allowing for a non - singular bounce before the collision .",
    "the subsequent brane collision then excites these scalars which , in turn , transfer their energy to matter and radiation and reheat the universe . in this context , it is natural to expect that the ghost condensate becomes massive and disappears following the small instanton transition .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new and fully consistent scenario for the origin of the primordial density perturbations . instead of being generated through a rapid phase of accelerated expansion shortly after the big bang , here",
    "the perturbations are generated in a phase of slow contraction , long before the big bang .",
    "the key breakthrough in this paper is a non - singular bouncing cosmology , achieved by successfully merging the ekpyrotic phase with a subsequent nec - violating ghost condensate phase .",
    "we have derived the explicit consistency relations required for this merger to be successful .",
    "these can be fulfilled by a wide class of kinetic functions and scalar potentials .",
    "the entire cosmological evolution is , therefore , under control and can be tracked throughout at the level of a 4d effective theory .",
    "this framework allows us to settle the controversial issue of the fate of perturbations through the bounce .",
    "a non - singular bounce allows perturbations to remain in the linear regime throughout .",
    "more importantly , since the evolution can be described within a 4d effective theory , the curvature perturbation , @xmath1 , is unambiguously conserved and goes through the bounce unscathed . to generate a scale - invariant spectrum for @xmath1 in the pre big bang phase ,",
    "we have made use of a recently proposed mechanism of entropy perturbation generation  @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by having two ekpyrotic scalar fields rolling down their respective negative exponential potentials .",
    "we have found that the resulting amplitude for @xmath1 is remarkably similar to its counterpart in inflation .",
    "this confirms earlier claims in the ekpyrotic literature that the required level of tuning on the ekpryotic and inflationary scalar potentials from cobe normalization is comparable .",
    "additionally , the spectral index is slightly red for a wide class of potentials , consistent with recent evidence from wmap .    as with inflation , the remaining challenge is to embed this scenario within a uv complete theory of quantum gravity , such as string theory .",
    "potentials of the type required in new ekpyrosis can be realized in @xmath4 supergravity , including low energy effective string theories .",
    "however , the question of whether one can realize ghost condensation in string theory remains open . ultimately the bounce could be generated using an entirely different mechanism . and",
    "indeed many of the results described here , such as the generation of a scale - invariant @xmath1 and its propagation through the bounce , would apply equally well .",
    "our motivation in focusing on the ghost condensate was to provide as concrete a realization of our scenario as possible .    at the level of a cosmological scenario , ",
    "new ekpyrotic cosmology \" provides a consistent alternative paradigm to inflationary cosmology .",
    "the two scenarios make distinctive predictions for the gravitational wave spectrum : the inflationary spectrum is nearly scale - invariant , whereas that of ekpyrotic cosmology is very blue and , therefore , unobservable on large scales  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the generic prediction of the simplest inflationary models is a significant gravity wave amplitude , just below the current sensitivity levels of microwave background experiments  @xcite .",
    "ekpyrosis , on the other hand , predicts an unobservably small amplitude .",
    "thus the failure to detect b - mode polarization in upcoming experiments would place inflation in an uncomfortable corner  @xcite , while lending support to the ekpyrotic paradigm . + * acknowledgments * we are most grateful to s.  dubovsky , p.  creminelli , a.  nicolis , p.j .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a new scenario of the early universe that contains a pre big bang ekpyrotic phase . by combining this with a ghost condensate </S>",
    "<S> , the theory explicitly violates the null energy condition without developing any ghost - like instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> thus the contracting universe goes through a non - singular bounce and evolves smoothly into the expanding post big bang phase . </S>",
    "<S> the curvature perturbation acquires a scale - invariant spectrum well before the bounce in this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> it is sourced by the scale - invariant entropy perturbation engendered by two ekpyrotic scalar fields , a mechanism recently proposed by lehners _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ since the background geometry is non - singular at all times , the curvature perturbation remains nearly constant on super horizon scales . </S>",
    "<S> it emerges from the bounce unscathed and imprints a scale - invariant spectrum of density fluctuations in the matter - radiation fluid at the onset of the hot big bang phase . </S>",
    "<S> the ekpyrotic potential can be chosen so that the spectrum has a `` red '' tilt , in accordance with the recent data from wmap . </S>",
    "<S> as in the original ekpyrotic scenario , the model predicts a negligible gravity wave signal on all observable scales . as such </S>",
    "<S> new ekpyrotic cosmology \" provides a consistent and distinguishable alternative to inflation to account for the origin of the seeds of large scale structure . </S>"
