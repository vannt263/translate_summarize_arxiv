    "several pictures are taken of the user s face , with slightly different angles and facial expressions , to allow for more accurate matching . for verification and identification",
    ", the user stands in front of the camera for a few seconds , and the scan is compared with the template previously recorded .",
    "benefits of face biometric systems being that it is not intrusive , can be done from a distance , even without the user being aware of it ( for instance when scanning the entrance to a bank or a high security area ) .",
    "weaknesses of face biometric systems : face biometric systems are more suited for authentication than for identification purposes , as it is easy to change the proportion of one s face by wearing a mask , a nose extension , etc . also , user perceptions / civil liberty : most people are uncomfortable with having their picture taken",
    ". applications of face biometrics include access to restricted areas and buildings , banks , embassies , military sites , airports , law enforcement .",
    "one advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be re - issued .",
    "if a token or a password is lost or stolen , it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version .",
    "this is not naturally available in biometrics .",
    "if someone s face is compromised from a database , they can not cancel or reissue it .",
    "cancellable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics .",
    "it was first proposed by n. k. ratha , j. h. connell and r. m. bolle @xcite .",
    "several methods for generating cancellable biometrics have been proposed . the first fingerprint based cancellable biometric system was designed and developed by s. tulyakov , f. farooq and v. govindaraju @xcite .",
    "essentially , cancellable biometrics performs a distortion of the biometric image or features before matching .",
    "the variability in the distortion parameters provides the cancellable nature of the scheme .",
    "some of the proposed techniques operate using their own recognition engines , such as a. b. j. teoh , a. goh and d. c. l. ngo @xcite and m. savvides , b. v. k. v. kumar and p. k. khosla @xcite . whereas other methods , such as m. a. dabbah , w. l. woo and s. s. dlay @xcite take the advantage of the advancement of the well - established biometric research for their recognition front - end to conduct recognition .",
    "although this increases the restrictions on the protection system , it makes the cancellable templates more accessible for available biometric technologies .",
    "the result of applying an edge detector to an image may lead to a set of connected curves that indicate the boundaries of objects , the boundaries of surface markings as well as curves that correspond to discontinuities in surface orientation .",
    "thus , applying an edge detection algorithm to an image may significantly reduce the amount of data to be processed and may therefore filter out information that may be regarded as less relevant , while preserving the important structural properties of an image .",
    "the edge detection filters used for experimentation are based on discrete laplace operator , sobel operator @xcite , roberts cross operator @xcite , frei - chen operator @xcite and prewitt operator @xcite .",
    "biometric cryptosystems as discussed by y. dodis , r. ostrovsky , l. reyzin and a. smith @xcite , f. hao , r. anderson and j. daugman @xcite , k. nandakumar , a.k .",
    "jain and s. pankanti @xcite , y. sutcu , q. li and n. memon @xcite , use techniques that associate an external key with a user s biometric to obtain helper data .",
    "the helper data should not reveal any significant information about the template or the key and at the same time it can be used to recover the key when the original biometric is presented .",
    "the concept of data hiding in digital watermarks has been discussed by c. t. hsu and j. l. wu @xcite .",
    "encryption algorithm to secure the image using fingerprint and password has been discussed by manvjeet kaur , dr . sanjeev sofat and deepak saraswat @xcite involves more time consuming methods .",
    "a hash function is an algorithm that transforms ( hashes ) an arbitrary set of data elements , such as a text file , into a single fixed length value ( the hash ) .",
    "the computed hash value may then be used to verify the integrity of copies of the original data without providing any means to derive said original data .",
    "this irreversibility means that a hash value may be freely distributed or stored , as it is used for comparative purposes only .",
    "sha stands for secure hash algorithm .",
    "sha-2 includes a significant number of changes from its predecessor , sha-1 .",
    "sha-2 consists of a set of four hash functions with digests that are 224 , 256 , 384 or 512 bits .",
    "we have used sha-256 for our experimentation .",
    "+ the security provided by a hashing algorithm is entirely dependent upon its ability to produce a unique value for any specific set of data .",
    "when a hash function produces the same hash value for two different sets of data then a collision is said to occur .",
    "collision raises the possibility that an attacker may be able to computationally craft sets of data which provide access to information secured by the hashed values of pass codes or to alter computer data files in a fashion that would not change the resulting hash value and would thereby escape detection .",
    "a strong hash function is one that is resistant to such computational attacks .",
    "a weak hash function is one where a computational approach to producing collisions is believed to be possible .",
    "a broken hash function is one where a computational method for producing collisions is known to exist . in 2005",
    ", security flaws were identified in sha-1 , namely that a mathematical weakness might exist , indicating that a stronger hash function would be desirable .",
    "although sha-2 bears some similarity to the sha-1 algorithm , these attacks have not been successfully extended to sha-2 .",
    "the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the u.s .",
    "national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) in 2001 @xcite .",
    "the algorithm described by aes is a symmetric - key algorithm , meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data .",
    "aes is based on a design principle known as a substitution - permutation network , and is fast in both software and hardware .",
    "we have used aes to generate key size of 256 bits ( aes-256 ) .",
    "high speed and low ram requirements were criteria of the aes selection process .",
    "thus aes performs well on a wide variety of hardware , from 8-bit smart cards to high - performance computers .",
    "_ step 1 : _ input face image from dataset ( att , yale or ifd ) which is in greyscale ( or converted ) .",
    "the att dataset of faces ( formerly the orl database of faces ) , yale dataset and ifd ( indian face dataset ) are unmodified except for conversion to jpeg and renaming of the files .",
    "datasets used are att , ifd and yale with sample images shown in figure 3 , figure 4 and figure 5 respectively .",
    "_ step 2 : _ apply edge detection filter .",
    "the edge detection filters used for experimentation are based on discrete laplace operator , sobel operator , roberts cross operator , frei - chen operator and prewitt operator .",
    "_ step 3 : _ invert colors of the image and then auto normalize .",
    "this is done because a major drawback to application of the edge detection filters is an inherent reduction in overall image contrast produced by the operation , which is in turn used to become an advantage in our case since it provides obscuring the original image to an acceptable level .",
    "normalize stretches the histogram , so the whole range of colors is used as to get more information out of the image .",
    "hence by inverting the filtered image and auto normalizing we get the contrast to an acceptable level .",
    "_ step 4 : _",
    "calculate sha-256 hash value of the final cancellable face image and encrypt it with aes-256 bit cipher .",
    "the aes-256 bit cipher is a symmetric key algorithm which uses the same password for encrypting and decrypting .",
    "_ step 5 : _ obtain the final filtered face image and store in the corresponding dataset .",
    "dataset att - l is the set obtained after applying step 2 with laplace edge detector filter and step 3 on att dataset ( sample shown in figure 6 .",
    "dataset att - s is the set obtained after applying step 2 with sobel edge detector filter and step 3 on att dataset ( sample shown in figure 7 ) .",

    "dataset att - p is the set obtained after applying step 2 with prewitt edge detector filter and step 3 on att dataset ( sample shown in figure 10).similarly for yale and ifd datasets .",
    "_ steps 1 to 3 : _ same as in enrolment .",
    "_ step 4 : _ apply face recognition methods to identify the person set . in our experiment",
    "the face recognition methods use the following : pca ( principal component analysis ) , ipca ( incremental pca ) , lda ( linear discriminant analysis ) and ica ( independent component analysis ) .",
    "_ step 5 : _ for the set of images of the matched person , verify the sha-256 hash values after decrypting with aes-256 cipher .",
    "this step ensures that the stored biometric templates have not been tampered with .",
    "the proposed method starts with a non - invertible feature transformation by using edge detection filters and is combined with a key binding biometric crypto system .",
    "the sha-256 hash value , which is aes-256 bit encrypted , helps in binding the cancellable template with an encrypted key .",
    "the aes-256 bit cipher is a symmetric algorithm and hence uses the same password for encryption and decryption . here",
    "the password that is used to bind the values can be user driven or be at the system level , depending on the feasibility of the biometric system .",
    "our proposed method focuses on the roberts cross based edge detector due to its consistently highest matching accuracy across different datasets [ table 1 , table 2 , and table 3 ] .",
    "according to roberts , an edge detector should have the following properties : the produced edges should be well - defined , the background should contribute as little noise as possible , and the intensity of edges should correspond as close as possible to what a human would perceive .",
    "after applying the edge filter(s ) , the image colors are inverted since edge filters discard other information than the detected edges ( first image of figure 11 ) .",
    "the image is then auto normalized edges ( second image of figure 11 ) to the full dynamic range , to further enhance the remaining details . in image processing",
    ", normalization is a process that changes the range of pixel intensity values .",
    "applications include photographs with poor contrast due to glare , for example .",
    "normalization is sometimes called contrast stretching . in more general fields of data processing , such as digital signal processing ,",
    "it is referred to as dynamic range expansion .",
    "the purpose of dynamic range expansion in the various applications is usually to bring the image , or other type of signal , into a range that is more familiar or normal to the senses , hence the term normalization . often , the motivation is to achieve consistency in dynamic range for a set of data , signals , or images to avoid mental distraction or fatigue .",
    "for example , a newspaper will strive to make all of the images in an issue share a similar range of greyscale .",
    "normalization is a linear process .",
    "if the intensity range of the image is 50 to 180 and the desired range is 0 to 255 the process entails subtracting 50 from each of pixel intensity , making the range 0 to 130 .",
    "then for each pixel the intensity is multiplied by 255/130 , making the range 0 to 255 .",
    "auto - normalization in image processing software typically normalizes to the full dynamic range of the number system specified in the image file format .",
    "we have found through our experiment that when the face images are auto normalized after applying edge filter and inverting colors , matching accuracy increases .",

    "the filtered images can thus be stored instead of the unaltered face images , thereby providing a form of encryption .",

    "the cancellable templates can be re - issued which provides new hash values automatically .",
    "due to the non - invertible nature of the templates there is no worry of misuse of lost data .",
