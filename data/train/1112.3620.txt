    "the title of this paper is a paraphrase of that of an article ( `` probably guilty : bad mathematics means rough justice '' ) , appeared in new scientist in october 2009@xcite , whose _ incipit _ induced me to write a ` defense of columbo , ' that finally turned into a _",
    "sui generis _ introduction to probabilistic reasoning  @xcite .",
    "indeed , as i wrote in @xcite , `` i can give firm witness that scientific practice is plenty of mistakes of the kind reported [ in the cited new scientist article ] , that happen even in fields the general public would hardly suspect , like frontier physics , whose protagonists are supposed to have a skill in mathematics superior to police officers and lawyers . '' in fact , although it might sound amazing , the ` bad mathematics ' that induces a judge to form a wrong opinion about somebody s guilt or innocence is _ the same _ that , for example , in april of this year made media and general public",
    "_ believe that particle physicists strongly believed _ (",
    "although not yet certain ) fermilab had made `` the most significant discovery in physics in half a century''@xcite  how else should normal people interpret a statement such as `` this result has a 99.7 percent chance of being correct''@xcite ?",
    "although i am quite used to fake claims of this kind , some of which are discussed in @xcite , and i have no interest in analyzing each individual case , the reason i want to return here to this subject , focusing on the fermilab case , is twofold .",
    "first , due to the modern fast communication on the internet , i was involved in discussions about the issue ` discovery or not ? ' and realized that even people with university background in mathematics or physics were induced to think that it was _ most likely _ a discovery , or at least that fermilab physicists were convinced this was the case .",
    "second , a few days after the cdf announcement , i had to lecture phd students in perugia@xcite and therefore i amused myself to collect related news and comments on the internet , because i expected that claim would have been a hot topic , as it turned out to be the case .",
    "finally very recent interactions with students and young researchers in lecce  @xcite convinced me to resume the paper draft started on the train rome to perugia .",
    "on the 4th of april this year a paper appeared in the _ arxiv _ reporting about the `` _ invariant mass distribution of jet pairs produced in association with a w boson in p@xmath5 collisions at @xmath6tev _ ''  @xcite and the result was officially presented two days later in a ` special joint experimental - theoretical physics seminar ' at fermilab  @xcite . in the meanwhile , on the 5th of april the article `` _ at particle lab , a tantalizing glimpse has physicists holding their breaths _ '' appeared on the new york times  @xcite .",
    "the following days the news spread all around the world ( you can amuse yourself enquiring google with the languages you know ) .",
    "let us sketch how that happened .",
    "figure [ fig : cdf_1 ] reports the upper plots    of figure 1 of the cited cdf paper .",
    "the left side one shows the histogram of the ` data , ' the jet - jet mass distribution in 8 gev bins , for a total of about 10800 events ( points with vertical bars ) .",
    "the colored regions show the predictions split into several contributions , the most important of which is due to the production of two w bosons , or of a w boson together with a z boson ( red ) .",
    "we see that at around 140 gev there are more events than ` expected ' ( an expression which we shall return to later ) .",
    "the right side plot shows the data after the contributions called here ` background ' ( all but the red one of the left plot ) were subtracted ` arithmetically . ' in the five bins between 120 and 160 gev there are about 230 events ( but in the side bins there are even ` negative events ' whose meaning is only mathematical ) .",
    "that was ` the excess ' .      a customary way to quantify",
    "the difference between an observed spectrum and the expected one is the famous @xmath7 statistic .",
    "distribution with @xmath8 _ degrees of freedom _ , our ( probabilistic ) expectation ( ` expected value ' ) is @xmath8 , with expectation uncertainty ( ` standard deviation ' ) @xmath9 .",
    "hence if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are variables of that kind , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , our expectations will be `` @xmath14 '' and `` @xmath15 '' , respectively .",
    "( as a side remark , we notice that , that adding a gaussian component to explain the ` excess ' , the difference between expected and observed value of the test statistic increases , since the @xmath7 goes to 56.7 for the entire region and 10.9 for the ` peak region ' . ) ] the cdf paper reports a `` @xmath7 per degree of freedom '' ( @xmath16 ) of 77.1/84 for the entire spectrum and 26.1/20 for the region 120 - 160 gev . in both cases",
    "statistical practice based on this test states that `` there is nothing to be surprised '' .",
    "i know by experience that , when a test does not say what practitioners would like , other tests are tried  like when one goes around looking for someone that finally says one is right .",
    "indeed , in the statistics practice there is much freedom and arbitrariness about which test to use and how to use it .",
    "this is because _ hypothesis tests _ of the so called _ classical statistics _ do not follow strictly from probability theory , but are just a collections of _ ad hoc prescriptions_. for this reason i do not want to enter on what cdf finally quotes as _ p - value _",
    "( with the only comment that it does not even seem a usual p - value ) .",
    "let us then just stick to the paper , reporting here the claim , followed by a reminder about what a statistician would understand by that name :    * `` we obtain a p - value of @xmath17 , corresponding to a significance of 3.2 standard deviations'';@xcite * `` the p - value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed , assuming that the null hypothesis is true.''@xcite [ the _ null hypothesis _ ( @xmath18 ) is in this case `` only standard physics , without contributions from new phenomena '' . ]",
    "but now we come to the clue point of this paper , since the cdf report @xcite is by itself not so ` dangerous ' .",
    "people do not know about p - values and , as a matter of fact , even those who calculate them for scientific purposes seem to by highly confused about their meaning@xcite , as we shall see later .",
    "normal people only understand what is the chance that a team has made a discovery instead of having just observed a statistical fluctuation . or ,",
    "at least , how much experts believe that the bump is hint of new physics , instead than a fluke .",
    "let us go straight to read how the thing was reported in some online resources ( boldface is mine ) .",

    "the updating depends only on the bayes factor , a function of the probability of @xmath37 given either hypotheses , and _ not on the probability of other events that have not been observed and that are even less probable than @xmath37 _ ( upon which p - values are instead calculated ) .",
    "* one should be careful not to confuse @xmath47 with @xmath39 , and in general , @xmath48 with @xmath49 . or , moving to continuous variables , @xmath50 with @xmath51 , where ` @xmath52 ' stands , depending on the contest , for a _ probability function _ or for a _ probability density function _ , while @xmath30 and @xmath53 stand for an observed quantity and a true value , respectively",
    ".    in particular the latter points looks rather trivial , as it can be seen from the senator vs woman example of the abstract .",
    "but already the gaussian generator example there might confuse somebody , while the ` @xmath53 vs @xmath30 ' example is a typical source of misunderstandings , also because in the statistical jargon @xmath51 is called ` likelihood ' function of @xmath53 , and many practitioners think it describes the probabilistic assessment concerning the possible values of @xmath53 ( again misuse of words !  for further comments see appendix h of @xcite ) .",
    "fake claims of discoveries are mainly caused by statistical prescriptions that do not follow probabilistic reasoning , meant as _ mathematics of beliefs _ , as it was conceived as a whole by laplace and that nowadays is known under the appellative ` bayesian ' . as a consequence    *",
    "the concept of probability of causes is refused ; * the role of bayes theorem to update beliefs is rejected , and hence * * the role of prior knowledge is not explicitly recognized ; * * the myth has been created that a single hypothesis can be ` tested ' without taking explicitly into account alternative(s ) ; * the intuitive concept of ` probabilities of causes ' has been surrogated by _ ad hoc _ hypothesis test prescriptions , * * whose choice and use are rather arbitrary ; * * whose results are routinely misinterpreted .    unfortunately , this wobbly construction faces against the human predisposition to think naturally in terms of degrees of belief about anything we are in condition of uncertainty , including the several causes that might have produced the observed effects .",
    "the result of this mismatch is that    * probabilities of the effects given the causes are confused with the probabilities of the causes given the effects ; * even worse , p - values are used as if they were the probability that the hypothesis under test is true .",
    "in addition , the pretension that ` priors are not scientific and should not enter the game ' ( `` the data should speak by themselves '' ) avoids that sound scientific priors mitigate the deleterious effects of misunderstood p - values .",
    "but , fortunately , being the natural intuition of physicists rather ` bayesian'@xcite , after all it is more a question of _ rough scientific communication _ than of _",
    "rough science_. in fact , even the initial excitement of someone who takes a bit too seriously claims that the rest of the physics community classifies immediately as ` fake '  priors !  is harmless , if the discussions remain in the community .",
    "and the debates are often even profitable , because they offer an opportunity to check how new possible phenomena and new explanations could fit into the present _ network of beliefs _ based on all previous experimental observations .",
    "this is for example what has recently happened with the exchange of ideas that has followed the opera result on neutrino speed , from which most of us have learned something .",
    "as far as the communication of claims to non experts , that include also physicists of other branches , or even of a close sub - branch , my recommendation is of making use , at least qualitatively , of the bayesian odd update , i.e.    * state how much the experimental _ data push _ towards either possibility ( that is the bayes factor , which _ has nothing to do with p - values _ ) ; * state also how _",
    "believable _ are the two hypotheses _ independently of the data in object_.    i am pretty sure most people can make a good use of these pieces of information .",
    "moreover , my recommendation to journalist and opinion makers ( including bloggers and similar ) is that , in the case of doubt :    * do nt accept answers in terms of p - values , unless you are sure you understand them well and you feel capable to explain their correct meaning to the general public without they become somehow probabilities of the hypotheses to be compared ( good luck ! ) ; * refuse as well ` confidence levels ' , ` 95% confidence exclusion curves ' and similar ; * _ ask straight the direct questions _ : * * how probable it is ?",
    "( possibly informing  threatening !  him / her in advance that his / her answer will be reported as `` dr x.y .",
    "considers it such and such percent _ probable _ '' . )",
    "* * how much do you believe ?",
    "( same as the previous one . )",
    "* * how much would you believe in either hypothesis if you did not have this data ?",
    "( the answer allows you to estimate the priors odds . )",
    "* * how much would you believe in either hypothesis given these data , if you considered the two hypotheses initially equally probable ? ( the answer allows you to evaluate the bayes factor . ) * * how much would you bet in favor of your claim ? ( and if you realize there are the conditions described in section [ ss : role_betting ] and figure [ fig : xkcd - neutrinos ] , _ do nt miss the opportunity to gain some money ! _ )    to end , i would like to congratulate all people working at lhc on the amazing high quality work done in these years and on having been able to report these convincing hints on the higgs boson in a record time ( i had never betted in favor of this possibility in 2011 even six months ago ! but now the real exciting bet is _",

    "since , just before i was going to post this paper there has been the joint atlas and cms seminar on the higgs boson search at cern , followed by days of rumors , i can not avoid to add here some last minute comments on these results , comparing them with the cdf case .    the big difference between the fermilab result discussed here and that of cern@xcite is essentially a question of _ priors _ , whose role was discussed in section [ sec : beliefs ] .",
    "if we observe something unexpected , we need an overwhelming experimental evidence before we are convinced this is really a genuine discovery , which is not case of the highly expected higgs at lhc .",
    "these are the arguments in favor of the fact that _ the elusive beast has been finally surrounded _ ( every particle hunter sniffs it , although it will be considered to finally in ` our hands ' only when we shall be able , with the increasing number of events , to study its behavior , such as decay modes etc . ) :    * the so called standard model of particle physics provides an excellent description of a _ network of experimental facts _ , and such a particle is required to give a sense to the theory ; * the indirect information on the higgs boson ( ` radiative corrections ' ) constrains its mass at the _ order of magnitude _ of 100gev ( although with a large uncertainty  see @xcite for a probability distribution , even though this has been slightly changing with time ) ; * direct searches at lep have pushed its mass with _ almost certainty _ above 114gev ; , the 95% cl bound has nothing to do with 95% probability that its value was above the bounds . translating the experimental information from the direct search into probabilistic assessments",
    "is not that easy , because the number also depends on the upper limits . in particular , if there would be ` no ' upper bound on the mass ( that obviously can not weigh grams ! )",
    "there is no way to calculate the required probability . for further details",
    "see @xcite and chapter 13 of @xcite . ] * similarly , direct searches at the lhc and at the tevatron have squeezed its mass value into a relative narrow window ( i save the reader yet another disquisition on the meaning of those limits ) ; * the cern indication shows up * * in the middle of the remaining window of possibility ( and then not in contradiction with other experimental pieces of information ) ; * * with production rate in agreement with the theory and _ with many other experiments _ ( from which the theoretical parameters have been inferred ) ; * * with decay modes also in substantial agreement with expectations ; * * in two detectors , although with some differences that can be considered physiological , taking into account of the difficulty of the search .",
    "in addition , i would also like to remark that the presentations of the two team leaders have been rather prudential , as if , instead of the higgs , it were just an unexpected bunch of extra events in the middle of nowhere .      * the reason why practically every particle physicist is highly confident that the higgs is in the region indicated by lhc has little to do with the _ number of sigma s _ ( i hope the reader understands now that the mythical value of 5 for a ` true discovery ' is _ by itself _ pure nonsense , as it is clear from the comparison between ` ? ? ? ' at the tevatron and the higgs boson at cern _ in the only place it could be _ after it has been hunted unfruitfully elsewhere . ) * this number of sigma s can not be turned in probabilistic statements ( or odds ! ) about higgs or not - higgs , as we read again on the new york times : + _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   _ * the atlas result has a chance of less than one part in 5,000 of being due to a lucky background noise * , which is impressive but far short of the standard for a `` discovery , '' which requires one in 3.5 million * odds * of being a random fluctuation._@xcite + ( again misinterpreted p - values  * basta ! * ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * instead , if we want to make quantitative probabilistic assessments , we _ need the likelihoods _ ( this time this noun has the technical meaning statisticians use ) , per each experiment and per each channel , instead of the frequentistic 95% cl exclusion curves , of dubious meaning and useless to be combined .",
