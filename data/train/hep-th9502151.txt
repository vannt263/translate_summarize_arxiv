    "for over a decade now , the finite - element method has been developed for application to quantum systems .",
    "( for a review of the program see @xcite . )",
    "the essence of the approach is to put the heisenberg equations of motion for the quantum system on a minkowski space - time lattice in such a way as to preserve exactly the canonical commutation relations at each lattice site .",
    "doing so corresponds precisely to the classical finite - element prescription of requiring continuity at the lattice sites while imposing the equations of motion at the gaussian knots , a prescription chosen to minimize numerical error .",
    "we have applied this technique to examples in quantum mechanics and to quantum field theories in two and four space - time dimensions . in particular , recent work has concentrated on abelian and non - abelian gauge theories @xcite , especially on issues of chiral symmetry breaking .    because it is the equations of motion that are discretized , a lattice lagrangian does not exist in minkowski space .",
    "this is because the equations of motion are in general nonlocal , involving fields at all previous ( but not later ) times .",
    "similarly , a lattice hamiltonian does not exist , in the sense of an operator from which the equations of motion can be derived .",
    "however , because the formulation is unitary , a unitary time - evolution operator must exist which carries fields from one lattice time to the next . for linear finite elements",
    "this operator in quantum mechanics has been explicitly constructed @xcite .",
    "construction of this operator requires solving the equations of motion , which are implicit .",
    "therefore , it is most useful , and perhaps surprising , that when matrix elements of the time evolution operator are constructed in a harmonic oscillator basis , they do not require the solution of the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "although these general formulas were derived some years ago , it seems they have not been exploited . our purpose here is to study , in a simple context , the matrix elements of the evolution operator , and see how accurately spectral information and wavefunctions may be extracted .",
    "our goal , of course , is to apply similar techniques in gauge theories , for example , to study chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "let us consider a quantum mechanical system with one degree of freedom governed by the continuum hamiltonian @xmath4 from which follow the heisenberg equations @xmath5 these equations are to be solved subject to the initial condition @xmath6=i.\\ ] ] it immediately follows from ( [ eqm ] ) that the same relation holds at any later time @xmath7=i.\\ ] ]    now suppose we introduce a time lattice by subdividing the interval @xmath8 into @xmath1 subintervals each of length @xmath9 . on each subinterval ( `` finite element '' )",
    "we express the dynamical variables as @xmath10th degree polynomials @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a local variable ranging from @xmath13 to @xmath9 .",
    "we determine the @xmath14 operator coefficients @xmath15 , @xmath16 , as follows :    1 .",
    "on the first finite element let @xmath17 2 .",
    "impose the equations of motion ( [ eqm ] ) at @xmath10 points within the finite element , at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "this then gives @xmath21 3 .",
    "proceed to the next finite element by requiring continuity ( but not continuity of derivatives ) at the lattice sites , that is , on the second finite element , set @xmath22 and again impose the equations of motion at @xmath23 , and so on .    how are the @xmath24 s determined ? by requiring preservation of the canonical commutation relations at each lattice site , @xmath25=[q_0,p_0]=i , \\label{unitarity}\\ ] ] one finds    @xmath26    these points are exactly the gaussian knots , that is , the roots of the @xmath10th legendre polynomial , @xmath27 amazingly , these are precisely the points at which the numerical error is minimized .",
    "it is known for classical equations that if one uses @xmath1 @xmath10th degree finite elements the relative error goes like @xmath28 , while imposing the equations at any other points would give errors like @xmath29 .",
    "let us consider a simple example .",
    "the quartic anharmonic oscillator has the continuum hamiltonian @xmath30 for which the equations of motion are @xmath31 if we use the linear ( @xmath32 ) finite - element prescription given above , the corresponding discrete lattice equations are @xmath33 ( notice the easily remembered mnemonic for linear finite elements : derivatives are replaced by forward differences , while undifferentiated operators are replaced by forward averages . ) by commuting the first of these equations with @xmath34 and the second with @xmath35 the unitarity condition ( [ unitarity ] ) follows immediately .",
    "these equations are implicit , in the sense that we must solve a nonlinear equation to find @xmath36 and @xmath37 in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "although such a solution can be given , let us make a simple approximation , by expanding the dynamical operators at time 1 in powers of @xmath9 , with operator coefficients at time 0 .",
    "those coefficients are determined by ( [ leqm ] ) , and a very simple calculation yields @xmath40 we can define fock - space creation and annihilation operators in terms of the initial - time operators @xmath41 which satisfy @xmath42=1.\\ ] ] here we have introduced an arbitrary variational parameter @xmath43 , which represents the width of the corresponding harmonic oscillator states . the fock - space states ( harmonic oscillator states ) are created and destroyed by these operators : @xmath44 which states are not energy eigenstates of the anharmonic oscillator .",
    "we can now take matrix elements in these states of the dynamical operators at lattice site 1 , using ( [ exp ] ) : @xmath45 and @xmath46 where we have assumed approximately exponential dependence on the energy difference @xmath47 .",
    "equating the coefficients of the terms through order @xmath48 constitutes four equations in two unknowns .",
    "these equations are consistent and yield @xmath49 so the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state is approximately @xmath50 which is only 5% higher than the exact result @xmath51 .",
    "a similar calculation using quadratic finite elements ( @xmath52 ) reduces the error to 0.5% .",
    "numerical results for a large number of energy differences can also be obtained by taking the discrete fourier transform of the time sequence @xmath53 .",
    "for example , for 1000 finite elements , energy differences are computed at the 23% level @xcite .",
    "because the canonical commutation relations are preserved at each lattice site , we know that there is a unitary time evolution operator that carries dynamical variables forward in time : @xmath54 for the system described by the continuum hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in the linear finite - element scheme , we have found @xcite the following formula for @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 ^ 2+v(g^{-1}(4x / h^2)),\\ ] ] @xmath58 the implicit nature of the finite - element prescription is evident in the appearance of the inverse of the function @xmath59 .    given the time evolution operator , a lattice hamiltonian may be defined by @xmath60 . for linear finite elements @xmath61 differs from the continuum hamiltonian by terms of order @xmath48 .",
    "for example ,    [ quadfe ] @xmath62,\\label{hc}\\\\ v={\\lambda\\over3}q^3:\\quad & & { \\cal h}={1\\over2}p^2+{1\\over3 } \\lambda q^3 + h^2\\left[{\\lambda\\over12}pqp+p^3\\right]+\\dots,\\\\ v={\\lambda\\over4}q^4:\\quad & & { \\cal h}={1\\over2}p^2+{1\\over4 } \\lambda q^4 + h^2\\left[-{\\lambda^2\\over24}q^6-{\\lambda\\over8}qp^2q\\right]+\\dots . \\label{ahc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if one uses quadratic finite elements @xmath61 differs from the continuum hamiltonian by terms of order @xmath63 , etc .",
    "remarkably , it is not necessary to solve the equations of motion to compute matrix elements of the dynamical variable . introduce creation and annihilation operators as in ( [ aadag ] ) .",
    "then , in terms of harmonic oscillator states ( [ hostates ] ) the following formula is easily derived @xcite for a general matrix element of @xmath36 : @xmath64 where @xmath59 is given by ( [ gee ] ) , @xmath65 is the @xmath66th hermite polynomial , and we have introduced the abbreviations @xmath67 for the example of the harmonic oscillator , this formula gives for the ground state ",
    "first excited state energy difference @xmath68 , consistent with ( [ hc ] ) , while for the anharmonic oscillator ( [ qaho ] ) if we expand in @xmath9 we obtain precisely the expansion ( [ q1 ] ) .",
    "a similar formula can be derived for the harmonic oscillator matrix elements of the time evolution operator .",
    "( there is an error in the formula printed in @xcite . )",
    "@xmath69 } , \\label{umat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which again is expressed in terms of @xmath59 not @xmath70 .    for the harmonic oscillator , where @xmath71 , ( [ umat ] ) gives for the ground - state energy @xmath72 which follows from ( [ hc ] ) . for the general anharmonic oscillator , @xmath73 , again we expand in powers of @xmath9 , with the result , for the harmonic oscillator ground state , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and    @xmath76    this result also derivable from ( [ quadfe ] ) , using ( [ aadag ] ) , but with considerably more labor .",
    "equating powers of @xmath9 in ( [ woo ] ) gives us two equations , which are to be solved first for the dimensionless number @xmath77 .",
    "once the number @xmath77 is determined , the value of @xmath78 is expressed as @xmath79    for a first estimate , we use only the @xmath80 equation ( [ first ] ) and employ the `` principle of minimum sensitivity '' ( pms ) @xcite that is , use the stationary value of @xmath77 , @xmath81^{1/(k+1)}\\over 2^{(k-1)/(k+1)}}.\\ ] ] specific examples are @xmath82 which are higher than the exact values @xcite of 0.420805 , 0.43493 , and 0.46450 by about 2% , 7% , and 13% , respectively .",
    "in fact , when we solve ( [ woo ] ) for @xmath77 , that is solve @xmath83 , we find complex values , for example , for @xmath3 @xmath84 the imaginary part is small , and the real part is only 0.7% low .",
    "the corresponding result for @xmath85 is @xmath86 , where the real part is now only 2% high .",
    "however , for @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and the real part is still 11% high .",
    "the failure of ( [ wo1 ] ) to be real does not indicate any breakdown of unitarity , but only that the one state approximation is not exact .",
    "we do much better by making a two - state approximation , where we must diagonalize the @xmath89 matrix @xmath90 for @xmath3 we then find the following relation between @xmath91 and @xmath92 : @xmath93 , \\label{omgood}\\ ] ] which , for the @xmath94 sign , is plotted in fig .",
    "this graph shows that the ground - state energy is very insensitive to the value of @xmath77 for a broad range of values .",
    "the principle of minimum sensitivity gives @xmath95 in spectacular agreement with the exact result , being only 0.1% high , while it gives a value for the third state , @xmath96 accurate to 1% .",
    "( the exact value is @xmath97 @xcite . )",
    "solving for @xmath77 from the eigenvalues of ( [ u ] ) gives even better results : @xmath98 where the ground state energy is now low by 0.06% , the imaginary part being negligible .",
    "the real part of the energy of the third state is low by only 0.5% .",
    "these results for the ground state are much better than those resulting from the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "the corresponding pms values for the @xmath85 and @xmath87 oscillators are similarly impressive : @xmath99 ( + 0.9% ) and @xmath100 ( + 2.7% ) , respectively . using the @xmath101 data to compute @xmath77 gives truly outstanding agreement :    @xmath102    where the real parts of the ground - state energies are now low by 0.5% and 0.2% , respectively .",
    "in the process of diagonalizing ( [ u ] ) we find the corresponding wavefunctions in the two - state approximation , that is , the wavefunctions are taken to be linear combinations of @xmath103 and @xmath104 harmonic oscillator states of width @xmath43 .",
    "the real parts of these wavefunctions are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "( the imaginary parts amount to only 2% for the ground - state wavefunction and 5% for the excited - state wavefunction . )",
    "these are normalized to unity at the origin to facilitate comparison with @xcite .",
    "when these are compared with the exact wavefunctions given in @xcite , we see that the approximate ground - state wavefunction is nearly indistinguishable from the exact one , and is much better that the wkb wavefunction given there .",
    "the excited - state wavefunction is quite good , but deviates slightly from the exact wavefunction , and in particular , the minimum at @xmath105 should be about 10% deeper .",
    "this deviation is not surprising , since the exact excited - state wavefunction must contain a substantial mixing with the @xmath106 harmonic oscillator state .",
    "the error in the excited - state wavefunction is also manifested in that fact that in this approximation the two wavefunctions are not quite orthogonal , the magnitude of the overlap being 5% .",
    "the simple calculations given here for quantum - mechanical anharmonic oscillators are the beginning of a program to develop use of lattice hamiltonian techniques to explore gauge theories in the finite - element context .",
    "the numerical results presented in sec .  [ matu ] and [ wf ] also hold in the continuum , by virtue of ( [ quadfe ] ) , but the calculations are much more tedious without the use of the finite - element formula ( [ umat ] ) .",
    "it is in two or more space - time dimensions that the essential nature of the lattice in such calculations comes into play @xcite .",
    "the high accuracy contrasted with the simplicity of the approach leads us to expect that we can extract spectral information , anomalies , and symmetry breaking from an examination of the time - evolution operator in gauge theories .",
