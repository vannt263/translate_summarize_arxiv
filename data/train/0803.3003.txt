    "this flat powerlaw index suggests for a hard source .",

    "emission nebulae ( a few hundred parsecs in diameter ) with both low- and high - ionization emission lines have been detected around some ulxs ( wang 2002 , pakull & mirioni 2003 ) .",
    "higher spatial resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio observations will be able to detect the morphology and kinematics of the nebulosity at the position of the ulx .",
    "an interesting remark regarding the galactic location of ulx is that both ulx and the hii complexes # 5 and # 9 are located in a spiral arm of ngc  5954 .",
    "this spiral arm has a strange appearance because part of it is not curved but straight , this distortion probably being an effect of tidal interaction with the companion sa galaxy ngc  5953 .",
    "the ulx and the mentioned complexes are located where the spiral arm bends becoming straight .",
    "near - infrared images of ngc  5953/5954 were retrieved from the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) archive .",
    "astrometry between the 2mass and the chandra images was done using the nucleus of ngc  5953 ( offset in r.a .",
    "is 0.00@xmath38 and in dec . 0@xmath41.3 ) .",
    "although there are 2mass sources in the area , they do not match peaks in our h@xmath6 data .",
    "no point - like 2mass sources were detected at the ulx position at the detection limit of 20 mag .",
    "the nrao very large array    faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( vla  first , becker , white & helfand 1995 ) image of ngc  5953/5954  field is shown in fig .",
    "the peak flux densities at the nuclei of ngc  5953 and ngc  5954 are 16.72 and 2.95 mjy beam@xmath2 , respectively , with an rms of 0.15 mjy . once again , to help guide the eye , we plot the ellipse at the chandra position of the ulx .",
    "this shows that no radio emission was detected at the position of the ulx during the first observation although there is a weak radio source nearby with integrated flux density around 0.7  mjy .",
    "from _ chandra _  observations of ngc  5953/5954 we have detected a bright ulx , which is most likely an elongated object around 350 pc long .",
    "both powerlaw and bremsstrahlung models fit equally well to the _ chandra _  spectrum of this ulx .",
    "possible optical counterpart of this ulx system is an object of absolute magnitude -(7.1@xmath50.7 )  mag .",
    "we do not know the color of this object .",
    "since , the ulx is a bright x - ray luminous source , we thus expect that its optical companion is an o - type supergiant .",
    "however , the possibility of a young star cluster ( wyder , hodge & cole 2000 ) can not be ruled out , especially when some ulxs have been detected in the vicinity of young star clusters ( zezas et al . 2002 ; karret et al . 2004 ; krauss et al . 2005 ) . from fabry - perot observations ,",
    "we have detected excess diffuse h@xmath6 and [ nii ]  ( @xmath76584  ) emissions , above the ambient background , at the astrometric - corrected _ chandra _  position of the ulx .",
    "fabry - perot velocity maps also show that this ulx is most likely associated with an emission nebula , which is expanding at a rate of 30@xmath57  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "counterparts of this ulx are not detected in the 2mass and vla / first data .",
    "based on these results , different scenarios can be invoked to describe the possible nature of the ulx system : ( 1 ) a foreground star , ( 2 ) a background object , ( 3 ) a gravitational lens system , ( 4 ) ulx consists of two ulxs , ( 5 ) an x - ray transient , ( 6 ) a supernova remnant and ( 7 ) an x - ray beamed system . here",
    "we discuss these possibilities in detail .",
    "the ratio between the x - ray and optical fluxes ( f@xmath51 ) is around 140 , which is extremely large for any stellar object .",
    "value of this ratio for stars ranges between 10@xmath52 and 0.1 ( maccacaro et al .",
    "in addition , the value of the hydrogen column density is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of the galactic value ( table 1 ) . thus , we can rule out the foreground origin of this ulx .",
    "similarly , the value of f@xmath51 for normal galaxies , clusters of galaxies and agns is much lower than the observed value of around 140 ( maccacaro et al . 1988 ; stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) . for blazars",
    ", this ratio could be up to 50 .",
    "even if we assume that the ulx is an x - ray selected blazar with f@xmath51 @xmath4140 , then the expected radio flux density at 1.4 ghz , assuming synchrotron emission from the same population of electrons responsible for the optical emission , the expected flux density will be more than 50 mjy ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ; landt et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is far above the emission detected from the nearby , weak radio source located at 5  from the chandra position of the ulx ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "thus , we can confidently rule out that the ulx is a background object .",
    "if the elongated image of the ulx is due to double sources , then it may be possible that it is a gravitational lens system . in this scenario ,",
    "we expect two optical objects at the positions of the two x - ray sources . however ,",
    "from the hst image we do not see a second object within the astrometric corrected error circle at the _ chandra _  position of the so called second x - ray source .",
    "thus , we rule out this possibility .",
    "it may be possible that the elongated shape of the ulx is due to the presence of two ulxs separated by an arcsec . with the available data we can neither rule out nor establish this hypothesis .",
    "however , it can be mentioned that the radial profile i.e. , the radial distribution of the counts per pixel at the position of the ulx , gradually declines .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 . in addition",
    ", we would like to mention that the chance probability of detecting two ulxs seperated by an arcsec among 4000 sources detected in more than 100 galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _",
    "( swartz et al . 2004 ) is extremely low , less than 3.5@xmath2310@xmath42 .",
    "these results suggest that the _ chandra _  image of cxou j153434.9 + 151149 is elongated .",
    "extremely low values of the ratio of radio to x - ray fluxes ( f@xmath53 ) have been detected in x - ray transients ( fender & kuulkers 2001 ) and also in the ulx candidate in ngc  5408 ( kaaret et al .",
    "non - detection of radio emission at the position of the ulx suggests that the f@xmath53 for the ulx candidate in ngc  5953/5954 is consistent with those of x - ray transients .",
    "however , this ulx was detected three times in three observations .",
    "thus , it may not be an x - ray transient .    extended x - ray morphology of the ulx indicate that a young supernova remnant ( snr ) may explain the properties of this ulx .",
    "typically , young snrs have x - ray luminosities of @xmath410@xmath50 ergs  s@xmath2 , which is two orders of magnitude lower than the x - ray luminosity of ulxs .",
    "however some supernova ( sniin ) explosions are extremely powerful , which can produce x - ray luminosities up to 10@xmath15 ergs  s@xmath2 ( fabian & terlevich 1996 ) .",
    "these rare events occur only in late type galaxies , mainly in sc galaxies , and are thought to be due to the explosion of a massive star in a very dense circumstellar medium , probably ejected in a previous evolutionary phase of the supernova progenitor , i.e. during its red giant phase .",
    "these snrs evolve faster in comparison with the normal evolution of snrs in less dense media and enter into the radiative phase bypassing the sedov phase .",
    "they reach maximum luminosity in less than 20 years after the sn explosion , when their radii are small ( r @xmath10 0.1 pc ) . h@xmath6 luminosities and expansion velocities of these snrs could reach up to 10@xmath1  ergs s@xmath2 and thousands of km  s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "in fact , the evolution and duration of the x - ray bright phase of type iin sne is very uncertain , which is detected up to 25 - 30 years after explosion ( fabian & terlevich 1996 ; lenz & schlegel 2007 ) .    from our fp observations we have found that the nebula around the ulx could be expanding at a rate of 30  km  s@xmath2 , which is too small compared to those of sniin / snrs ( fabian & terlevich 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , the major - axis diameter of the ellipse drawn on the x - ray image of the ulx ( left panel of fig .",
    "2 ) is @xmath42.5 , which corresponds to @xmath4350  pc .",
    "this is extremely large compared to @xmath40.2  pc ( fabian & terlevich 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the observed properties of the ulx in ngc  5953/5954  are different from those of sniin / snrs .",
    "hst / wfpc2 results suggest that the possible counterpart of the ulx in ngc  5953/5954  may be either an o - type supergiant star or a young star cluster .",
    "in addition , steady emissions have been detected from this ulx on all three occasions in excess of 10@xmath1  ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "observed , persistent x - ray emissions may originate from stable accretion disks , which are generally formed through the thermal time scale mass transfer ( king et al .",
    "it has also been shown that both stellar - mass black hole and imbh binaries can emit persistent x - ray emissions ( kalogera et al .",
    "thus , the luminous x - ray emission from cxou j153434.9 + 151149 can be explained in the frame works of both the stellar - mass black hole and the imbh systems ( begelman 2006 ; copperwheat et al .",
    "2007 ; mizuno et al . 2007 ; patruno & zampieri 2007 ) .",
    "it is very likely that high - mass binary stars will form in the environment of strong ob - associations on the spiral arm of the galaxy , where the ulx is located .",
    "fast evolution of these binary stars will lead to high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "thus , beaming from a stellar - mass black hole binary with an o - type supergiant star can emit x - rays in excess of 10@xmath1  ergs s@xmath2 ( king et al .",
    "if we assume that the maximum mass of a stellar - mass black hole is 20  m@xmath9 , which is accreting at the eddington rate , then the beaming has to enhance the emission by a factor of 10 to produce the observed luminosity of the ulx .",
    "this factor of 10 can be equated with @xmath54 , where the doppler factor , @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56 is the lorentz factor of the outflow , @xmath57 is the three velocity of the outflow in units of the velocity of light , @xmath58 is the spectral index ( @xmath58=0.5 , table  1 ) , and @xmath59 is the inclination angle to the outflow ( lind & blandford 1985 ) .",
    "this gives the value of @xmath60 equals to 1.78 .",
    "this value of @xmath60 can be achieved when the values of @xmath59 are 0@xmath8 , 15@xmath8 and 30@xmath8 and the corresponding @xmath57 values are 0.6 , 0.64 and 0.9 , respectively .",
    "these results demonstrate that to enhance the intrinsic x - ray intensity by a factor of 10 , the outflow has to be viewed by the observer , at least , within 30@xmath8 . however , the projected minor - to - major axial ratio of the ellipse ( fig .",
    "2 ) is roughly around @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that the inclination angle to the elongated emission is @xmath453@xmath8 , assuming that the thickness of the elongated emission is sufficiently small . with this value of @xmath59 ,",
    "we have computed a range of values of @xmath60 for different values of @xmath57 between 0.1 and 0.9 and find that the maximum possible enhancement of the x - ray emission will be only by a factor 3.1 with the value of @xmath57 equals to 0.6 .",
    "thus , the observed x - ray morphology of cxou j153434.9 + 151149 , which constrains the inclination angle , indicates that the observed x - ray luminosity can not be explained with beaming from a stellar - mass black hole binary .",
    "however , changes by one pixel in the minor- or major - axis diameters of the x - ray elongated emission will lead to the inclination angle close to 30@xmath8 . then , beaming from stellar - mass black hole binary system will be able to produce the observed x - ray brightness of cxou j153434.9 + 151149 with @xmath57 equals to 0.9 .",
    "thus , high s / n _ chandra _  image of this ulx is essential to accurately determine its morphology .",
    "in addition , kinetic energy of such a highly relativistic outflow ( velocity = 0.9  c ) will inflate the local environment and will form special spatial structure .",
    "ionized nebulae with bubble - like morphology have been detected around some ulxs ( roberts et al .",
    "2003 ; pakull & mirioni 2003 ; pakull , gris & motch 2006 ) .",
    "these bubbles are several hundred parsec in diameter with expansion velocities around 5080 km  s@xmath2 ( rosado et al .",
    "1981 , rosado et al . 1982 , valdez - gutirrez et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the expansion could be due to the combined action of energetic supernova explosions and stellar winds , or to continuous inflation by geometrically - beamed jets ( chu & mac low 1990 , miller 1995 , valdez - gutirrez et al .",
    "2001 , wang 2002 , pakull & mirioni 2003 , pakull , gris & motch 2006 ) .",
    "some nebulae show barrel - type shapes or enhanced emission along opposite directions that could be interpreted as excitation from a beamed source ( roberts et al . 2003 ; pakull & mirioni 2003 ) .",
    "however , some nebulae have displayed spur - shape , which requires an isotropic flux of energetic photons to explain the observed heii flux ( kaaret et al . 2004 ; pakull , grise & motch 2006 ) . nebulae formed by the combined action of supernova remnants and stellar winds are not supposed to have heii emission unless it contains very massive stars . thus , detection of an non - spherical heii nebula at the position of the ulx will support the beaming model of the ulx in ngc  5953/5954 .",
    "based on the x - ray morphology of cxou j153434.9 + 151149 , we have seen above that the beaming could enhance the intrinsic x - ray intensity , at the most , by a factor of three .",
    "this clearly suggests that the mass of the accretor of this ulx system has to be more than 50  m@xmath9 , assuming that it is accreting at the eddington rate .",
    "however , the x - ray colors and spectral results indicate that this ulx is a hard / flat powerlaw source ( @xmath58=0.5 , table  1 and section 2.1 ) , which indicates that it is a sub - eddington system .",
    "if we assume that l@xmath62/l@xmath63@xmath40.1 , then the mass of the accretor will be more 500  m@xmath9 .",
    "this type of imbh system can be hosted in young star cluster , which is most likely present within the error circle at the position of the ulx ( shown in fig .",
    "3 ) . in addition , imbh system will photoionize its local environment , which can be detected from the optical spectra . future observations , which we have planned to carry out , will reaveal the true nature of this system .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have detected a bright ulx in ngc  5953/5954 .",
    "chandra _",
    "image is elongated .",
    "most likely , its optical companion is either an o - type supergiant star or a young star cluster .",
    "this ulx is associated with an extended nebular h@xmath6 and [ nii ]  ( @xmath76584  ) emissions with a [ nii]/h@xmath6 line - ratio of about unity .",
    "this nebula is moving at the characteristic velocities of the galaxy ngc  5954 .",
    "a nearby , faint radio source is located at 5  from the _ chandra _  position of the ulx .",
    "all these results are best explained in the frame work of a model , which consists of mildly - beaming black hole binary of mass more than 50  m@xmath9 . follow - up radio , optical and x - ray observations are highly wanted to clearly establish the nature of this ulx .",
