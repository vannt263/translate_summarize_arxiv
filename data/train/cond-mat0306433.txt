    "studying the dynamics of a simple system interacting with its environment is a very important problem in physics .",
    "the theoretical description of this problem started a long time ago .    in the context of classical mechanics",
    "several master equations , such as the boltzmann equation , the chapman - kolmogorov master equation or the fokker - planck equation , were derived in order to describe the time evolution of the probability density of the system variables .    in the context of quantum mechanics , wich interests us in this paper ,",
    "the time evolution of a system interacting with its environment is described in terms of a reduced density matrix that is obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom of the environment from the total ( system plus environment ) density matrix . in this way",
    ", the first quantum master equation was obtained by pauli @xcite in @xmath0 .",
    "this equation is called the _ pauli equation _ and describes the evolution of the populations ( i.e. , the diagonal elements of the density matrix ) when the system is weakly perturbed by an additional term in its hamiltonian .",
    "the transition rates between populations are given by the fermi golden rule .",
    "in @xmath1 , redfield @xcite derived the so - called _ redfield equation _ in the context of nmr for a system such as a spin interacting with its environment .",
    "this equation has been widely used and applied to many systems where the dynamics of the environment is faster than the dynamics of the system .",
    "this equation is markovian and has the defect of breaking the positivity on short time scales of the order of the environment correlation time for initial conditions near the border of the space of physically admissible density matrices .",
    "many similar master equations for a system interacting with an environment have been derived since then starting from the von neumann equation and making several assumptions ( weak coupling limit , markovianity , separation of time scale between system and environment ) @xcite . in @xmath2 lindblad @xcite",
    "derived the most general quantum master equation which is markovian and which preserves positivity .",
    "the redfield equation has a lindblad form in the case of @xmath3-correlated environments .",
    "more recently , a _",
    "non - markovian redfield equation _ has been obtained that preserves positivity and reduces to the redfield equation in the markovian limit @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that the markovian redfield equation can preserve positivity if one applies a slippage of initial conditions that takes into account the non - markovian effects on the early dynamics .",
    "similar considerations have been proposed for different master equations @xcite .",
    "as far as one considers the weak - coupling regime , all the master equations derived till now in the literature at second order of perturbation theory can be deduced from the non - markovian redfield equation .",
    "the problem is that the non - markovian redfield equation as well as the other aforementioned master equations existing in the literature are based on the fundamental assumption that the environment does not feel the effect of the system .",
    "this assumption seems realistic for macroscopic environments but not in the case of nanoscopic isolated total systems in which the density of states of the environment can vary on an energy scale of the order of the system energy scale . because nanoscopic physics is experimentally progressing very fast",
    ", we expect that such effects will become important and measurable in future applications .",
    "already , quantum dissipation is being envisaged on the nanoscale for applications such as spin dynamics in quantum dots @xcite or isomerizations in atomic or molecular clusters in microcanonical statistical ensembles @xcite .",
    "another possible application is the intramolecular energy relaxation in polyatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to systematically derive from the von neumann equation a master equation which takes into account the fact that the energy of the total system ( system plus environment ) is finite and constant and , therefore , that the energy distribution of the environment is affected by energy exchanges with the system .",
    "the aforementioned equations can be derived from our master equation , which thus appears to be very general .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ genpauleq ] we systematically derive our master equation and the non - markovian redfield equation from the von neumann equation , by perfoming a second - order perturbative expansion in the coupling parameter ( under the assumption of weak coupling ) for general environments .",
    "thereafter , we consider the markovian limit in both cases . we also show how",
    ", in this limit and neglecting the coupling between the populations and the quantum coherences , our master equation reduces to a simple equation of pauli type for the total system , taking into account the modifications of the energy distribution of the environment due to the energy exchanges with the system .",
    "finally , we compare our master equation to the redfield equation and discuss how the redfield equation can be seen as a particular case of our master equation . in sec .",
    "[ spin - boson ] we apply our master equation and the redfield equation to the case where the system is a two - level system interacting with a general environment . in sec .",
    "[ spin - gorm ] , we apply the master equations to the case where the system is a two - level system interacting with a complex environment ( such as a classically chaotic or many - body environment ) that is modeled by random matrices from a gaussian orthogonal ensemble , which we call gaussian orthogonal random matrices ( gorm ) . in sec .",
    "[ numres ] , we compare the solutions of the non - markovian and markovian master equations to the exact solutions of the complete von neumann equation in the case of our spin - gorm model .",
    "conclusions are finally drawn in sec .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total systems that we consider here is made of the sum of the system hamiltonian @xmath4 and the environment hamiltonian @xmath5 plus a coupling term that has the form of the product of a system operator @xmath6 and a environment operator @xmath7 .",

    "the main idea is to describe the time evolution in terms of quantities which are distributed over the energy of the environment .",

    "the assumption ( [ formegenrhopauli ] ) has the effect of neglecting the contributions from the environment coherences to the system dynamics ( albeit the system coherences are kept in the description ) .",
    "we remark that the form ( [ formegenrhopauli ] ) is not supposed to strictly hold at all times but is an assumption in order to obtain a closed set of equations for the quantities @xmath35 .    in order to better understand the meaning of the above definitions , we notice that the reduced density matrix of the system takes the form @xmath42 which can be represented in the basis of the eigenstates of the system hamiltonian as @xmath43 the goal of the precedent choice for the form of @xmath44 is thus to obtain a description in which the state @xmath33 of the system is correlated with the energy @xmath34 of the environment . in other words ,",

    "since the modulations of @xmath225 have a period @xmath226 shorter than the decay time @xmath220 of the bessel function @xmath223 , a shape reminiscent of a bessel function only appears as an envelope of the oscillations of the decay curve .",
    "we conclude that , as expected from theoretical arguments , our master equation gives excellent predictions , especially in situations where the system energy is greater than or of the same order of magnitude as the typical energy scale of variation of the density of states of the environment .",
    "we also notice that for non - markovian dynamics that happen on a time scale of order @xmath222 , the non - markovian redfield equation give the same result as our master equation for short time scales .",
    "but for longer time scales our equation is the only one that correctly describes the dynamics .",
    "we derived in this paper a master equation to study the dynamics of a quantum system interacting with its environment .",
    "this equation is obtained by a perturbative expansion with respect to the coupling parameter between the system and its environment .",
    "our equation is more general than the previously obtained perturbative master equations because our equation explicitly takes into account the exchange of energy between the system and its environment .",
    "this effect is important when the density of state of the environment varies in a significant way on energy scales of the order of the system energy scales .",
    "we showed how the well - known master equations of the literature can be derived from our equation ( [ our.nonmarkov.master.eq ] ) by performing different types of approximations .",
    "our equation reduces to the non - markovian redfield equation ( [ redfield.nonmarkov.master.eq ] ) if one neglect the changes in the density of states of the environment induced by the system .",
    "moreover , we showed that by performing the markovian approximation on our equation and neglecting the coherence contribution to the population dynamics , we get a pauli - type equation ( [ origpaulipop ] ) for the total system ( system @xmath227 environment ) that describes the time evolution in terms of distributions defined on the energy spectrum of the environment .",
    "when one neglects the changes in the energy distribution of the environment , the markovian version of our equation ( that is now equivalent to the redfield equation ) reduces to the master equation derived by cohen - tannoudji and corworkers in ref .",

    "we have applied our equation to a two - level system interacting with a general environment ( spin - environment model ) , especially , in the case where the environment operators are random matrices ( spin - gorm model ) . in this case",
    ", we have carried out numerical simulations of the spin - gorm model ( for which one can computed the exact solutions ) that show the greater accuracy of our master equation with respect to the other well - known master equations in markovian and non - markovian situations .",
