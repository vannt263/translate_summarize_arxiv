    "consider a simple point process @xmath0 without accumulation points in a metric space @xmath1 .",
    "we think of @xmath0 either as an integer - valued measure or as a collection of points ( the support of the measure ) . with the latter viewpoint in mind",
    ", we define the greedy walk on @xmath0 as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "define , for @xmath4 , @xmath5 the set @xmath6 denotes the set of unvisited points of @xmath0 up until ( and including ) time @xmath7 .",
    "we write @xmath8 for the set of points that are never visited by the walk .",
    "once the underlying environment @xmath0 is fixed , the process @xmath9 is deterministic ( except possibly for ties which need to be broken , but these will almost surely not occur in our setting ) .",
    "the greedy walk has been studied before in the literature , with various choices of the underlying point process .",
    "when @xmath0 is a homogenous poisson process on @xmath10 , one can show using a borel  cantelli  type argument that @xmath11 with probability @xmath12 , that is , the greedy walk does not visit all points of the underlying point process .",
    "more precisely , the expected number of times the greedy walk starting from @xmath13 changes sign is @xmath14 @xcite . due to this , rolla _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a related problem , in which each point in the process can be visited either once , with probability @xmath15 , or twice , with probability @xmath16 .",
    "they show that @xmath17 , for any @xmath18 , meaning that every point is eventually visited .",
    "another modification of the greedy walk on @xmath10 is studied by foss _",
    "et al . _",
    "the authors considered a dynamic version of the greedy walk , where the times and positions of new points arriving in the system are given by a poisson process on the space - time half - plane .",
    "they show that the greedy walk still diverges to infinity in one direction and does not visit all points . in the survey paper @xcite ,",
    "bordenave _ et al .",
    "_ state several questions about the behaviour of the greedy walk on an inhomogeneous poisson process in @xmath19 .",
    "we resolve here the problem for @xmath20 .",
    "in this paper we define @xmath0 to be an inhomogeneous poisson process on @xmath10 ( with the euclidean metric ) given by some non - atomic mean measure @xmath21 .",
    "for such a process , the number of points in disjoint measurable subsets of @xmath10 are independent and @xmath22 = \\frac{\\mu(a , b)}{k!}e^{-\\mu(a , b)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any @xmath23 and any @xmath24 , where , for any measurable @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the cardinality of the restriction of @xmath0 to the set @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the number of points in any interval @xmath28 is distributed like @xmath29 . sometimes , but",
    "not always , we will assume that the mean measure @xmath21 is absolutely continuous and given in terms of a measurable intensity function @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 for any measurable @xmath25 .",
    "throughout we let @xmath32 ( note that @xmath33 with probability @xmath12 ) , so that the walk starts in the origin .",
    "the process @xmath9 will be referred to as gwipp . if we want to emphasise the underlying point process , the underlying mean measure , or the underlying intensity function , we write gwipp@xmath34 , gwipp@xmath35 or gwipp@xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we say that the walk jumped over @xmath13 if @xmath37 for some @xmath7 .",
    "if the event @xmath38 occurs , then we say that gwipp is _",
    "recurrent_. otherwise we say that gwipp is _",
    "transient_. this choice of notation is explained by viewing each jump over @xmath13 as a pseudo  visit at @xmath13 .    to avoid certain degenerate cases",
    ", we will typically impose the following two conditions on the measure @xmath21 .",
    "a.   @xmath39 .",
    "[ meas : i ] b.   @xmath40 for all bounded measurable @xmath25 .",
    "[ meas : ii ]    denote by @xmath41 the set of all measures on @xmath10 which satisfy ( [ meas : i ] ) and ( [ meas : ii ] ) .",
    "note that the first condition is equivalent to @xmath42 with probability @xmath12 ; in remark [ rem : notinf ] we consider a case when this condition is not satisfied .",
    "the second condition is equivalent to @xmath43 with probability @xmath12 , for any bounded measurable @xmath25 , which implies that there are no accumulation points of the process . indeed ,",
    "if a process has accumulation points , it is possible that the @xmath44 in the definition of the greedy walk is not well - defined .    if @xmath45 , then gwipp@xmath35 is recurrent if and only if @xmath17 , and gwipp@xmath35 is transient if and only if @xmath11 .",
    "thus the dichotomy between recurrence and transience translates to a dichotomy between `` visits all points '' and `` does not visit all points '' .",
    "this stems from the fact that gwipp essentially can behave in two ways .",
    "either the points of @xmath0 are eventually dense enough that gwipp eventually gets stuck on either the positive or negative half - line and go towards @xmath46 or @xmath47 accordingly ( i.e.  transient ) , or the points of @xmath0 are sparse enough that there are infinitely many `` sufficiently long '' empty intervals on both half - lines , and that gwipp switches sign infinitely many times and thus visits all points of @xmath0 ( i.e.  recurrent ) .",
    "moreover , if gwipp@xmath35 is transient and @xmath21 symmetric around zero , then , by symmetry , gwipp@xmath35 goes to @xmath48 or @xmath47 with probability @xmath14 each .",
    "the aim of this paper is to characterise ( in terms of @xmath21 or @xmath49 ) when gwipp is recurrent or transient .",

    "the proof of this , presented in section [ sec:2 ] , is an application of campbell s theorem ( which allows one to determine whether random sums over poisson processes are convergent or divergent ) and the borel  cantelli lemmas .",
    "we remark a few things .",
    "first , the second part of the theorem is an immediate consequence of the first .",
    "second , this result also states that recurrence ( or transience ) is a zero - one event .",
    "third , it is a straightforward consequence that taking @xmath54 for all @xmath55 , i.e.  taking @xmath0 to be a homogenous poisson process with rate @xmath56 , results in gwipp@xmath36 being transient .",
    "this is well - known and another proof appears in @xcite .",
    "take now two point processes @xmath0 and @xmath57 , and assume gwipp@xmath34 is transient .",
    "consider @xmath58 .",
    "intuitively , adding more points to an already transient process only makes it `` more '' transient , since it will be more difficult to find long empty intervals which allow @xmath59 to change sign .",
    "conversely , removing points from an already recurrent process makes it `` more '' recurrent . since recurrence ( or transience )",
    "does not depend on the point process in any finite interval around @xmath13 , as the following result shows , it suffices to look at what happens far away from the origin .",
