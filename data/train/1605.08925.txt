    "compared to heat transfer by phonons in crystalline materials , heat transfer in amorphous materials is complicated by the existence of three regimes of vibrational modes.@xcite low - frequency propagons are delocalized and have a well - defined wave vector and group velocity,@xcite similar to phonons in crystals , while high - frequency locons are localized and contribute negligibly to thermal conduction.@xcite diffusons have intermediate frequencies and are delocalized , but do not have well - defined wave vectors or group velocities .",
    "the contribution of diffusons to thermal conduction can be notable , however , as they occupy the majority of the vibrational spectrum.@xcite    from kinetic theory,@xcite the contribution of an individual phonon or propagon mode to thermal conductivity is proportional to its mean free path ( mfp ) . because diffusons do not have a well - defined group velocity , it is not clear if they have a mfp or how it can be defined .",
    "their contribution to thermal conductivity can be predicted using their diffusivity , which is well - defined and can be calculated from allen - feldman theory.@xcite nevertheless , it would be insightful to identify a frequency - dependent length scale for propagons and diffusons describing the decay of the heat flux at each vibrational frequency .",
    "such a definition would lift the ( fundamentally ) arbitrary distinction between propagons and diffusons and enable a unified description of heat transfer at all vibrational frequencies .    in this paper , we apply the spectrally - decomposed mfp method@xcite to probe the non - equilibrium mfps of vibrational heat carriers in amorphous silicon ( a - si ) .",
    "this method is based on calculating the spectrally - decomposed heat current ( sdhc)@xcite in systems of different lengths using non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) simulations .",
    "the mfps are determined from the variation of the sdhc as a function of system length at each vibrational frequency.@xcite    we previously used the spectrally - decomposed mfp method to calculate the non - equilibrium mfps in low - dimensional systems such as carbon nanotubes@xcite and anharmonic chains.@xcite we demonstrated that the non - equilibrium mfps transparently describe the ballistic - to - diffusive transition in the length - dependence of thermal conductivity .",
    "compared to previous calculations for a - si , the spectrally - decomposed mfp method has several advantages . unlike in modal life - time calculations,@xcite we do not need to estimate the group velocities of individual modes to calculate their mfps .",
    "we also do not need to distinguish between propagons and diffusons@xcite nor resort to the harmonic approximation.@xcite in contrast to recent calculations studying the spectral conductivity of a - si in fixed - size systems , @xcite we focus on the mfps of heat carriers and the system - size dependence of thermal conductivity .",

    "the calculation methods are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] and the numerical results are discussed in sec . [",

    "we also introduce a simple method for the quantum correction of thermal conductivity from classical md simulations , based on weighting the sdhc by the quantum occupation function . because this quantum correction method operates at the frequency level",
    ", it is more reasonable than quantum - correction methods that operate at the system level ( see ref . and references therein ) and allows us to compare our predictions to experimental measurements .",

    "and the final density is 2,291 kg / m@xmath3 .",
    "after the equilibration of the quenched system , atoms located within a distance @xmath4 nm from the left and right edges of the structure are coupled to langevin heat baths at temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 with bath relaxation times of 1 ps . to prevent sublimation , atoms at the far left and right edges are fixed to their equilibrium positions .",

    "system lengths @xmath2 ( i.e. , the region between the baths ) between 1 and 10 nm at intervals of 1 nm are considered .",

    "[ fig : geom]).@xcite the sdhc @xmath8 between particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 located on opposite sides of this plane is given by the pair - wise sdhc equation @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the simulation time , @xmath13 is the angular frequency , and the interatomic force constant @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 the velocities @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the discrete fourier transforms of the atomic velocities @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( the exact definitions are in ref . ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the displacements of atoms @xmath9 and @xmath10 from their equilibrium positions in directions @xmath22,@xmath23 . in eq .  , @xmath24 is the interatomic potential energy function .",
    "the spectral flux through the plane of decomposition is obtained from eq .   by summing over all pairs of atoms ( one of the left side , denoted by @xmath25 , and one on the right side , denoted by @xmath26 ) within the potential cut - off distance of each other and dividing by the interface area @xmath27 : @xmath28 while eq .",

    "the two results agree within 4% .",
    "we attribute this good agreement to the stiffness of the interatomic bonds in a - si , which ensures that the first - order term in the current ( proportional to the harmonic force constants @xmath30 ) dominates the higher - order terms that are related to anharmonic force constants .",
    "this restriction to the first - order current term at the plane of decomposition does not , however , mean that anharmonic scattering in the bulk is neglected , because all anharmonic effects are included in the nemd simulations.@xcite    frequency - dependent mfps @xmath31 are calculated by determining @xmath32 for different system lengths @xmath2 and fitting the length - dependent @xmath32 to the equation @xcite @xmath33 } , \\label{eq : mfp}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the spectral flux when the baths are in contact ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "both @xmath34 and @xmath31 are determined from the fitting procedure . while @xmath34 depends on the details of the heat baths ,",
    "the mfps extracted from the length - dependence are not expected to depend on the bath details.@xcite the frequency - dependent mfps determined from eq .",

    "correspond to the decay length of the heat flux .",
    "this definition does not necessarily coincide with the conventional definition of the mfp as the decay length of a wave packet.@xcite this distinction is important for diffusons , which do not have a well - defined wave - vector so that the traditional definition can not be applied .",

    "finally , eq .   allows for a simple quantum correction to the thermal conductivity prediction , because the contributions of different frequencies can be weighted by the vibrational mode energy and occupation , as in the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite .",

    "can be written in the familiar landauer - bttiker form as @xcite @xmath47 the proposed quantum correction accounts for the quantum specific heat of the modes at each frequency , but does not account for quantum effects in the dynamics .",
    "the method is thus similar to the one recently introduced by lv and henry,@xcite who weight the modal contributions to the equilibrium green - kubo thermal conductivity by the quantum population function .",
    "all our nemd simulations are performed at a mean temperature of @xmath48 k with temperature bias @xmath49 k. choosing a relatively large temperature bias allows for very good signal - to - noise ratio in the spectral heat flux , suppressing the statistical noise .",
    "we checked that halving the bias to @xmath50 k does not change the spectral mfps .",
    "in addition , we checked that the heat flux is not sensitive to the exact arrangement of atoms arising from the melt - and - quench procedure , which we attribute to the large cross - section of the system giving rise to spatial averaging in the spectral currents .",
    "therefore , we performed a single melt - quench for each system length .",
    "for different system lengths @xmath2 . increasing the system length reduces the heat flux , especially at high frequencies , where the mfps are shorter . at frequencies below 2 thz ,",
    "the heat current is independent of system length , suggesting ballistic transport.,width=325 ]    the spectral heat flux @xmath1 for selected system lengths @xmath2 as a function of frequency @xmath51 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] . the spectral distribution of the heat flux for @xmath52 nm was recently analyzed in detail by zhou and",
    "hu,@xcite so we focus here on its length - dependence . as expected , increasing the system length reduces the heat current throughout the whole frequency range because of increased phonon - phonon scattering .",
    "the reduction is strongest at high frequencies , where the mfps are shorter compared to low frequencies . at frequencies less than 2 thz , the spectral current is nearly independent of system length .",
    "such nearly ballistic conduction suggest that the low frequency mfps are notably longer than the system sizes considered here .",
    "equation suggests that the inverse of the spectral flux will be linearly proportional to the system length , with the slope given by @xmath53^{-1}$ ] . to determine the mfps",
    ", we calculated the spectral flux for system sizes @xmath54 nm , plotted @xmath55 versus @xmath2 and fitted a linear function at each frequency using least squares fitting.@xcite a linear function accurately reproduces the length - dependence of @xmath55 ( not shown ) , as previously also observed for other systems.@xcite        because of the high computational cost associated with calculating the spectral heat fluxes for large systems , we limited our study to systems at most 10 nm long .",
    "this restriction precludes extracting mfps longer than 10 nm accurately , limiting the current analysis to frequencies greater than 2 thz .",
    "the mfps @xmath31 extracted from the linear fitting procedure are shown in a log - log plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfps ] . at frequencies below 5 thz ,",
    "the mfps obey a power - law scaling @xmath56",
    ". this scaling agrees with modal life - time calculations on a - si.@xcite at frequencies greater than 5 thz , the power - law scaling breaks down and the mfps increase with increasing frequency , giving rise to a local maximum around 8 thz .",
    "a similar maximum for a - si has been observed in effective mfps @xcite and in lifetimes.@xcite at higher frequencies , the mfps decrease again and fall below 1 nm , which is on the order of the silicon - silicon bond length . at such high frequencies ,",
    "the uncertainty is large because of the sensitivity of the spectral flux to the system size .",
    "larkin and mcgaughey reported a propagon - diffuson transition frequency of 1.8 thz,@xcite such that the frequency range considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfps ] mostly corresponds to diffuson - like modes . in the analysis",
    "below , we assume that the scaling @xmath56 ( solid line in fig . [",

    "with such scaling , the mfps exceed 100 nm below 530 ghz and 1 @xmath57 m below 170 ghz .",
    "while the @xmath58 scaling may break down in real situations because of defects , boundary scattering , or even the onset of a rayleigh - like @xmath59 scaling at very low frequencies , @xcite we assume it to hold for simplicity .",
    "we now investigate the length - dependence of the thermal conductivity using eq .  .",
    "the calculated thermal conductivity ( continuous line ) is compared with that determined directly from nemd simulations ( data points ) for lengths up to @xmath60 nm in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] . in the evaluation of the integral in eq .",

    "[ fig : mfps ] reproduces the length - dependence of thermal conductivity up to lengths @xmath62 nm to within 2% . this close agreement ( i )",
    "supports the assumption of @xmath61 scaling at low frequencies , ( ii ) shows that the mfp data in fig . [ fig : mfps ] , which were determined from simulations of systems shorter than @xmath63 nm , can be reliably used to estimate the relative contributions of different vibrational frequencies to thermal transport in much larger systems , and ( iii ) provides support for the accuracy of eq . in describing the length - dependence .    because the debye temperature of a - si is @xmath64 k @xcite , which is well above room temperature , we need to apply the quantum correction to compare the predicted temperature - dependence of thermal conductivity to experimental data .",

    "differences may also exist due to the use of the stillinger - weber potential and the classical nature of the nemd simulations .",
    "the increase of thermal conductivity with increasing temperature is well described by the quantum - corrected thermal conductivity . at temperatures higher than 300 k , the experimentally measured thermal conductivity increases slightly slower as a function of temperature than our prediction , but",
    "this disagreement may be related to our approximation that the mfps are independent of temperature . at such high temperatures ,",
    "anharmonic scattering will reduce mfps and therefore decrease the thermal conductivity . without the quantum - correction ,",
