    "this paper is an advanced part of a program that aims at studying propagation of singularities and regularity of solutions to linear hyperbolic equations and systems with non - smooth coefficients in algebras of generalized functions . to explain the setting , consider a wave equation of the form @xmath0 we are interested in the case of non - smooth coefficients @xmath1 and initial data distributions .",
    "the reasons to get into algebras of generalized functions are twofold .",
    "first , it is well - known that the existence of classical solutions requires a minimal degree of smoothness of the coefficients , as does the application of the classical machinery of pseudodifferential operators and fourier integral operators @xcite . in intended applications in seismology and continuum mechanics , the coefficients might have jumps at irregular interfaces or might be continuous , but non - differentiable paths of a stochastic process , thereby lacking the kind of smoothness required in the classical theory @xcite .",
    "second , as the solution is expected to be as singular as the initial data , equation ( [ eq : conswaveintro ] ) involves a nonlinear interaction of coefficient singularities with singularities in the solution , hence a product of distributions .",
    "there is a long history of results ( e.g. @xcite ) that equations of this type can be uniquely solved in the colombeau algebra @xmath2 of generalized functions .",
    "this is an algebra containing the space of distributions as a subspace .",
    "non - smooth coefficients and distributional initial data can be imbedded in this algebra , and hence generalized solutions are available in this setting .",
    "members of the colombeau algebras are equivalence classes of families @xmath3}$ ] of smooth functions that are characterized by certain asymptotic properties as @xmath4 .",
    "representatives of the colombeau solution satisfy @xmath5 where @xmath6 belong to a certain ideal .",
    "the question of regularity and propagation of singularities can be cast in the following form :    * is it possible to detect the singular support of the generalized solution from the asymptotic properties of its representing families @xmath3}$ ] as @xmath4 ?    in this respect ,",
    "a subalgebra @xmath7 of @xmath2 has been introduced in @xcite which satisfies @xmath8 .",
    "it plays the same role in the @xmath2-setting as @xmath9 does in the @xmath10-setting .",
    "in fact , the essential steps of regularity theory and propagation of singularities for colombeau solution have been taken in the past decades , when the coefficients are regular ( @xmath9 or @xmath7 with some additional properties ) .",
    "this starts with elliptic and @xmath7-hypoelliptic regularity , regularity of solutions with @xmath7-regular initial data , propagation of the @xmath7-singular support in the case of constant and of @xmath9-coefficients .",
    "further , a calculus of pseudodifferential operators and fourier integral operators has been developed in the colombeau setting that admits to deduce a number of results on the @xmath7-wave front set of the colombeau solution when the coefficients are @xmath7-regular @xcite .",
    "the central issue of the paper concerns non - smooth coefficients . when imbedded in the colombeau algebra , they should _ not _ belong to the subalgebra @xmath7 and it should be possible to detect the singularities that they produce in the generalized solution .",
    "the difficulty arises that in most of the previous existence results in the colombeau setting , coefficients are required to satisfy certain additional logarithmic or slow scale estimates as @xmath4 , which makes them @xmath7-regular . one way out is to change the scale on which regularity is described , as was done e.g. in @xcite .",
    "another way out is to consider only time - dependent coefficients .",
    "a number of results on propagation of singularities for scalar transport equations ( including refined properties of the @xmath7-wave front set at characteristic curves with kinks ) and on one - dimensional wave equations with time dependent coefficients have been obtained in the literature @xcite .",
    "what has been lacking so far is the important case of @xmath11-dependent coefficients .    at interfaces of discontinuity , incoming singularities produce a reflected and a transmitted wave",
    "in view of the intended applications in seismology and continuum mechanics , it is crucial to be able to detect the @xmath7-singularities carried by these waves .",
    "the present paper closes this gap in the literature by determining precise upper and lower bounds on the @xmath7-singular support of the solution in a number of paradigmatic cases .",
    "the paper has essentially two parts .",
    "in the first part , existence results on wave equations of the type ( [ eq : conswaveintro ] ) in any space dimension are given that do not require a logarithmic regularization scale for the coefficients .",
    "similar results are proven for the one - dimensional , non - conservative case , one - dimensional hyperbolic systems , together with a new existence result ( in the algebra @xmath2 ) for multidimensional wave equations with time dependent coefficients . in the second part , upper and",
    "lower bounds on the @xmath7-singular support of the generalized solution to the one - dimensional wave equation with an initial point singularity and an @xmath11-dependent coefficient with a jump singularity are given .",
    "the same is done for rotationally symmetric solutions to multidimensional wave equations with @xmath12-dependent coefficients .",
    "the paper is complemented by comparing the generalized solution with the distributional solution of the corresponding transmission problem , when it exists .",
    "the paper shows that in paradigmatic cases the colombeau solution carries the required information on the propagation of singularities and indeed answers question ( q ) affirmatively in these cases .",
    "this indicates that the colombeau setting may be appropriate for studying wave propagation phenomena in even more singular media , where no classical counterpart exists .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "required concepts of the theory of colombeau generalized functions are recalled .",
    "section 3 is devoted to new existence and uniqueness results for wave equations with non - smooth coefficients in colombeau algebras .",
    "the main goal is to show that in many situations bounds on the coefficients from above and away from zero suffice  no logarithmic asymptotic estimates are needed . in subsection 3.1 , this is done for the conservative wave equations with @xmath11-dependent propagation speed in any space dimension , in subsection 3.2 for the non - conservative wave equation in one space dimension , in subsection 3.3 for the wave equation with time - dependent propagation speed in any dimension .",
    "subsection 3.4 on scalar transport equations paves the way for the results on hyperbolic systems in one space dimension and @xmath11-dependent coefficients in subsection 3.5 .",
    "subsection 3.6 is a side remark on singularities produced by a discontinuity of the coefficient at time @xmath13 , if compatibility conditions are lacking , and that this classical phenomenon can also be detected in the colombeau setting .",
    "section 4 aims at proving upper _ and _ lower bounds on the singularities of the colombeau solution to wave equations , given initial data with a point singularity .",
    "subsection 4.1 treats the one - dimensional case with a coefficient having a jump at @xmath14 and with a delta function at @xmath15 as initial data .",
    "we prove that the reflected and the transmitted singularity can be detected in terms of the @xmath7-singular support of the colombeau solution , provided the height of the jump satisfies certain bounds .",
    "it is also shown that there is no reflected singularity if the coefficient is @xmath7-regular .",
    "subsection 4.2 addresses the one - dimensional wave equation with a @xmath12-dependent coefficient having a jump at @xmath16 . as a preliminary step",
    ", a regularity result is proven that states that if the initial data are @xmath7-regular , then so is the solution off the line @xmath16 .",
    "then we prove an upper bound on the singular support of the solutions for arbitrary colombeau initial data which are @xmath7-regular off the origin , generalizing our results from @xcite .",
    "the upper bound consists of the rays emanating from the origin at @xmath13 and the refracted and transmitted rays starting at the singularity at @xmath16 .",
    "( in @xcite it was shown that the bound is attained for delta function initial data . )",
    "next , we give sufficient conditions on the initial data such that singularities propagate out from the origin and remain present along the transmitted rays . again , this is complemented by precise bounds on the singular support of the solution if the coefficient is @xmath7-regular .",
    "finally , subsection 4.3 settles the rotationally symmetric case with @xmath12-dependent coefficient and delta function initial data in any space dimension .",
    "the appendix complements the paper by addressing the question of existence of associated distributions ( distributional limits of the family of regularizations defining the colombeau solution ) . extending our results from @xcite ,",
    "we show that in one space dimension , an @xmath11-dependent coefficient with a single jump at the origin and delta function initial data , the colombeau solution admits the distributional solution of the corresponding classical transmission problem as associated distribution . on the side",
    ", it is seen that the @xmath9-singular support of the distributional solution coincides with the @xmath7-singular support of the colombeau solution . as a final note , we remark that most of our existence results are based on @xmath17-versions of colombeau algebras , due to the energy methods used in the proofs .",
    "( exceptions are hyperbolic systems in one space dimension and the one - dimensional wave equation with @xmath12-dependent coefficient , in which cases the usual @xmath18-based algebras suffice . )",
    "we will employ the _ special colombeau algebra _ of generalized functions denoted by @xmath19 in @xcite ( called the _ simplified colombeau algebra _ in @xcite ) .",
    "however , here we will simply use the letter @xmath20 instead . in the context of energy estimates",
    ", we will also need @xmath21-based colombeau algebras , introduced in @xcite .",
    "this section serves to recall the definition and properties required for our purpose . for more details , see e. g. @xcite .    given a non - empty open subset @xmath22 of @xmath23 , the space of real valued ,",
    "infinitely differentiable functions on @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath24 , while @xmath25 refers to the subspace of functions all whose derivatives have a continuous extension up to the closure of @xmath22 .",

    "since @xmath41 and @xmath42 , there is a canonical map @xmath43 .",
    "however , this map is not injective , as follows from the fact that @xmath44 .    turning to @xmath21-based colombeau algebras , we assume for convenience that the open set @xmath22 has the strong local lipschitz property ( cf.@xcite ) , in order to have all required sobolev imbedding and extension theorems at our disposal .",

    "consequently @xmath53 for @xmath54 ; further , these spaces are differential algebras .",
    "let @xmath55 be the differential algebra of all maps from the interval @xmath27 $ ] into @xmath56 .",

    "in order to be able to detect the @xmath7-singular support of a generalized solution to the wave equation with non - smooth coefficients , it is necessary to have existence and uniqueness results that do not require logarithmic bounds on the coefficients ( as is the case with the classical existence results for hyperbolic systems in @xmath2 ) . indeed , if the ( discontinuous ) coefficients of the equation are regularized by convolution with a mollifier @xmath142}$ ] as in example1(b ) , they become @xmath7-regular generalized functions and contribute no @xmath7-singularities to the solution , in particular , no reflected or refracted waves , as will be seen below .",

    "this shows the singularities emanating from the origin due to lack of compatibility conditions of the initial data with the jump data .    as a second consequence",
