    "owing to the exceptionally large dielectric constant,@xcite the bohr radius ( @xmath16 ) is expected to be much larger than the lattice constant of srtio@xmath0 .",
    "consequently , the transport properties of srtio@xmath0 have been understood within a conventional description based on the relaxation time approximation.@xcite in addition , the observed mi transition@xcite around the critical carrier density ( @xmath17 ) of 10@xmath18 @xmath19 has been also interpreted in terms of the mott criterion@xcite @xmath20 for oxygen - deficient srtio@xmath21 using @xmath22 ( @xmath23 : bare electron mass ) and the room - temperature value of @xmath24,@xcite where @xmath16 is defined by @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the dielectric constant of the medium , and @xmath28 is the vacuum dielectric constant .",
    "although the mott criterion gives satisfactory estimates of @xmath17 for a great variety of semiconductors,@xcite the above discussion for srtio@xmath0 is questionable because of the highly temperature dependent dielectric constant@xcite and because of the absence of any insulating behavior in nb - doped srtio@xmath29 crystals down to @xmath30 @xmath19.@xcite furthermore , recent studies suggest that oxygen vacancies in srtio@xmath29 can not be treated as random point defects , but are rather highly clustered around extended crystalline defects.@xcite the resulting inhomogeneity in doping obscures the intrinsic mi transition . in order to extract intrinsic properties of the mi transition , it is crucial to observe critical behavior of the mi transition , namely weak localization , which has not been reported in srtio@xmath0 .    here",
    "we report the investigation of transport properties of undoped srtio@xmath0 single crystals under ultraviolet illumination down to 2 k. photogenerated electrons exhibit high electron mobility comparable to bulk chemically doped samples , while holes do not contribute to transport . by tuning the wavelength of illumination to shorter wavelength",

    "we have observed weakly localized behavior such as negative magnetoresistance when the sheet conductance is close to the two - dimensional mott minimum conductivity .",
    "photocarrier doping may be one of the most suitable techniques to characterize such critical behavior because of the immediate modulation of carrier density just by adjusting the intensity of illumination.@xcite in addition , the effect of inhomogeneity can be minimized as long as the light intensity profile is uniform on the sample surface .",
    "magnetoresistance measurements in different geometries revealed that the electron conduction tends to be two - dimensional at short wavelength .",
    "the result of longitudinal magnetoresistance measurement indicated that the dominant conduction occurs within the thickness estimated from the absorption coefficient of srtio@xmath0 .",

    "in the subsequent results , the temperature was increased above 150 k before changing the band - pass filters in order to remove any history effects originating from trapping states.@xcite in addition , the samples were exposed to illumination for an extended period of time to reach steady state before measurements .",

    "another characteristic response of weak localization appears in the low - field magnetoresistance .",
    "figure 5 shows the transverse magnetoresistance under varying intensity and wavelength of illumination at 2 k. under 310 nm illumination , we observed a small negative magnetoresistance at low field , which is typical of weak localization .",
    "this feature diminishes with increasing light intensity and increasing @xmath49 , until by @xmath45 nm no negative magnetoresistance is observed .",
    "the large positive magnetoresistance under high magnetic field originates from a cyclotron motion driven by the lorentz force , following @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a constant of the order of unity , related to the details of the fermi surface and the shape of the sample.@xcite this wavelength dependent magnetoresistance follows the dimensionality crossover indicated in fig .",
    "3 . under shorter wavelength illumination , electrons tend to localize with decreasing carrier density because the small penetration depth enhances their two - dimensional nature . under longer wavelength illumination ,",
    "electrons extend more three - dimensionally , and the reduced localization effect would be smeared out by the strong positive magnetoresistance .",
    "another reason of the absence of the negative magnetoresistance for @xmath45 nm may be the rather small @xmath58 .",

    "as shown in this figure , the magnetoresistance exhibits anisotropy , indicating that the magnetoresistance is caused by an orbital effect .",
    "moreover , the magnetoresistance in geometry 2 resembles that in geometry 3 .",
    "this clearly reflects two - dimensional behavior because the magnetoresistance in geometry 3 should be identical to the case of geometry 1 if the electronic system were completely three - dimensional .",
    "however , the longitudinal magnetoresistance should be absent in a purely two - dimensional system .",
    "in fact , similar anisotropic magnetoresistance has been observed in metallic thin films such as in@xmath90o@xmath0.@xcite in analogy with those results , magnetoresistance can be observed in the longitudinal geometry when the radius of the lowest landau level @xmath91 crosses the effective thickness of the conducting layer as the magnetic field increases . in fig .",
    "6(b ) , the onset of longitudinal magnetoresistance is about 0.06 t , which corresponds to @xmath92 nm .",
    "this value is comparable to the optical penetration depth value @xmath41(@xmath47 nm)=32 nm .",

    "6(a ) . we observed a logarithmic magnetic field dependence in all three geometries , which is qualitatively consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : amr ] ) .",
    "the observed conductivity correction is , however , the order of @xmath98 s even though the light intensity ( and thus @xmath38 ) is varied , while the theoretically predicted value is the order of @xmath99 s.    in considering this discrepancy , we note that we have observed a temperature dependence of mobility roughly consistent in magnitude with weak localization , while the magnetoresistance was about two orders of magnitude smaller than theoretically predicted .",
    "this asymmetry suggests another contribution to magnetoresistance .",
    "conventionally , electron - electron interaction is known to give a conductivity correction dependent on temperature and magnetic field , qualitatively similar to weak localization in the range of @xmath100 ( @xmath101 : mean free path).@xcite the sign and strength of magnetoresistance from this effect is dependent on the sign ( attractive or repulsive ) and strength of the electron - electron interaction.@xcite in a well screened system satisfying @xmath102 ( @xmath103 : inverse screening length ) , magnetoresistance is expected to be small , while the temperature dependent conductivity correction is the same order as eq .",
    "this is true of the present case because of large dielectric constant @xmath104 of srtio@xmath29  the low @xmath58 allows dynamic screening by the lattice . on the other hand",
    ", we observed a negative magnetoresistance only in the range of @xmath105 .",
    "in addition to the sharp drop of mobility in fig .",
    "3 , these facts indicate that our observations are affected both by weak localization and by electron - electron correlations .",
    "in this study , we have characterized magnetotransport properties of photocarrier - doped srtio@xmath0 single crystals by changing the intensity and wavelength of illumination . at short wavelength ,",
    "a drop of the hall mobility has been observed when the sheet conductance is close to the two - dimensional mott minimum conductivity , suggesting a two - dimensional mi transition .",
    "the uniformity of the light intensity and the tunability of carrier density of photocarrier doping have enabled us to investigate such critical behavior in srtio@xmath0 . although we have observed characteristic responses of weak localization , the negative magnetoresistance was much smaller than theoretically predicted . nevertheless , the geometrical dependence of the negative magnetoresistance clearly indicated dominant two - dimensional electronic transport with finite thickness .",
    "the discrepancy with weak localization theory may be due to the effect of an electron - electron correlation .",
    "an alternative way to precisely control carrier density is electrostatic doping in a field - effect transistor ( fet).@xcite recently , it has been successfully applied to srtio@xmath0 , maintaining rather high mobility.@xcite although an fet is also suitable to confine electrons in two dimensions , the confinement potential may suffer an unfavorable deformation by the gate bias due to the considerably electric - field dependent permittivity of srtio@xmath0.@xcite in contrast , we have demonstrated that the photocarrier doping can be used to precisely tune not only carrier density and but also the effective electronic thickness by separately adjusting the intensity and wavelength of illumination .",
