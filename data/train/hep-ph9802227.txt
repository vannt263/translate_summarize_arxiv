    "remarkbale progress has been made in understanding the physics of heavy mesons composed of a heavy quark and a light quark with the discovery of the heavy quark symmetry . to obtain detailed predictions",
    "one has to employ some specific nonperturbative methods , among which qcd sum rules @xcite is very useful .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite provides a systematic expansion of qcd in terms of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "the spectrum of the ground state heavy meson has been studied with the qcd sum rules in hqet in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the mass of the lowest excited heavy meson doublets @xmath6 and @xmath7 were studied with qcd sum rules in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) up to the order of @xmath8 .",
    "qcd sum rules has been used to analyse the couplings of the heavy hadrons with pions [ 5 - 15 ] .",
    "the widths for pionic decays of the lowest two excited doublets @xmath6 and @xmath7 is calculated with conventional qcd sum rules in the leading order of hqet in @xcite .",
    "light - cone qcd sum rules ( lcqsr ) with the full qcd lagrangian is first employed to derive the strong coupling constants : @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "recently the strong coupling constants : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 were calculated using lcqsr with finite heavy quark mass @xcite .",
    "the couplings of heavy baryons with soft pions have been estimated with qcd sum rules in an external axial field @xcite . in this work",
    "we employ the lcqsr in hqet to calculate the on - shell couplings of the pions with heavy meson doublets @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the leading order of @xmath4 .",
    "the lcqsr is quite different from the conventional qcd sum rules , which is based on the short - distance operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "the lcqsr is based on the ope on the light cone , which is the expansion over the twists of the operators .",
    "the main contribution comes from the lowest twist operator .",
    "matrix elements of nonlocal operators sandwiched between a hadronic state and the vacuum defines the hadron wave functions . when the lcqsr is used to calculate the coupling constant , the double borel transformation",
    "is always invoked so that the excited states and the continuum contribution can be treated quite nicely . moreover",
    ", the final sum rule depends only on the value of the wave function at a specific point like @xmath14 , which is much better known than the whole wave function @xcite .",
    "one difficult problem encountered in studying the decay widths of excited heavy mesons with qcd sum rules is the following .",
    "except for the lowest states @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the spectra contains a pair of states for any spin - parity @xmath17 with close values in their masses but quite different in magnitudes of their decay widths . in our case ,",
    "one of the two @xmath3 states is a narrow resonance decaying mainly by emitting a @xmath18 wave pion , while the other one is a very wide resonance decaying by emitting a @xmath19 wave pion .",
    "an interpolating current used for the narrow @xmath3 state with a small coupling to the other @xmath20 state may cause sizable error in the result of calculation .",
    "it is only in the @xmath21 limit , there is a conserved quantum number @xmath22 , the angular momentum of the light component , which can be used to differentiate the two states .",
    "therefore , hqet has important and unique advantage for this purpose .",
    "these are the motivation for our approach of using lcqsr in hqet .",
    "the proper interpolating current @xmath23 for the states with the quantum number @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath22 in hqet was given in @xcite .",
    "they were proved to satisfy the following conditions @xmath26&&\\times\\ : \\int \\,dt\\delta(x - vt)\\:\\pi_{p , j_{\\ell}}(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the @xmath21 limit , where @xmath27 is the polarization tensor for the spin @xmath24 state , @xmath28 is the velocity of the heavy quark , @xmath29 is the transverse metric tensor , @xmath30 denotes symmetrizing the indices and subtracting the trace terms separately in the sets @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are a constant and a function of @xmath35 respectively which depend only on @xmath25 and @xmath36 . because of equations ( [ decay ] ) and ( [ corr ] ) , the sum rule in hqet for decay widths derived from a correlator containing such currents receive no contribution from the unwanted states with the same spin - parity as the states under consideration in the @xmath21 . starting from the calculations in the leading order , the decay amplitudes for finite @xmath5",
    "can be calculated unambiguously order by order in the @xmath37 expansion in hqet .",
    "in the present work we shall confine ourselves to the lowest lying states in the leading order of @xmath37 expansion . denote the doublet @xmath38 with @xmath39 by @xmath40 and the doublet @xmath1 with @xmath41 by @xmath42 .",
    "there are many combinations for the coupling constant @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 belongs to the three doublets @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . due to",
    "the heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry there exist only six independent coupling constants , i.e. , three independent coupling constants when @xmath44 , @xmath45 belongs to different doublets and another three when @xmath44 , @xmath45 belongs to the same doublet .",
    "for example , from covariance and conservation of the angular momentum of the light component in the @xmath46 limit , the amplitudes for the decay of @xmath47 , @xmath48 to the ground states @xmath49 , @xmath50 in the doublet @xmath51 with @xmath41 have the following forms @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are polarization tensors for states @xmath56 , @xmath3 and @xmath57 respectively .",
