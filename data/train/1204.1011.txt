    "1a , the brightness increases with cell concentration .",
    "thus , in both nm and m samples with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , cells remain homogeneously distributed after 2 hours . while this remains true of the m sample at @xmath16 ,",
    "the nm sample in this case has started to separate into upper and lower phases with low and high concentrations of cells ( ` vapor ' and ` liquid ' respectively ) .",
    "this phase separation process is complete in the nm sample with @xmath17 , while it is only just starting at this @xmath1 for the m cells .",

    "the phase boundary and phase separation kinetics of nm cells correspond to that reported previously @xcite .",

    "we next imaged nm and m samples in the ` pre - transition ' region of the phase diagram , i.e. at polymer concentrations just below the respective phase boundaries . in this region of a classical atomic or molecular system , we expect to find transient clusters ( or ` liquid droplets ' ) .",
    "we found such pre - transition clusters in previous simulations of spherocylinder - polymer mixtures designed to mimic our experimental mixtures of nm bacteria and polymer @xcite .",
    "we observe pre - transition clusters in both nm and m samples : the static snapshots are rather similar ( an example from an m sample is shown in fig .",
    ". movies of the clusters , however , reveal a dramatic difference between nm and m clusters .",
    "nm clusters undergo what is recognizably brownian motion in both translational and rotation ( supplementary movie s1 ) . remarkably , however , the clusters self - assembled from motile cells translate with speeds approaching that of single cells and also rotate ( supplementary movies s2 and s3 ) .",
    "the clusters persist over the entire duration of observation ( minutes ) , during which the rotation is essentially _ unidirectional _ in a frame of reference in which the axis of the rotation is stationary ( see supplementary movies s2 and s3 ) , although the axis of rotation itself seems to drift randomly .",
    "occasional interruptions in this unidirectional rotation do occur , apparently due to collision with single motile cells or other clusters .",
    "the sense of the rotation appears to be random .",
    "this , then , is our second important finding .",
    "the interplay of motility and depletion attraction leads to the self - assembly of spontaneously rotating clusters , or micro - rotors .",
    "note that our self - assembled micro - rotors are qualitatively different from the bacteria - driven rotation of externally added micro - lithographed gear wheels with a built - in chirality  @xcite .",

    "the colours correspond to the propulsion velocity values in ( b ) used to estimate the active force @xmath25.,width=288 ]    in the absence of activity , two particles stay bound at separation @xmath19 until a thermal fluctuation increases this distance to beyond @xmath26 , at which point the particles cease to interact and become free . to estimate the effect of activity on depletion - driven phase separation , we consider two active particles pushing in the opposite directions with an active force @xmath27 while being held stationary by the depletion force .",
    "the particles come free at separation @xmath28 , where the total force acting on the particles becomes zero : @xmath29 giving @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "we take the effective potential confining two active particles to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is chosen such that @xmath34 ( see supplementary material ) , fig .",
    "3a . compared to the bare depletion potential",
    ", @xmath35 is shallower , and has slightly shorter range .    to estimate the phase boundary for particles interacting via @xmath35",
    ", we use the law of ` extended corresponding states ' @xcite , which states that the vapor - liquid phase boundaries ( or ` binodals ' ) of various systems of attractive particles collapse onto a single master curve if the attraction is characterized by its reduced second virial coefficient , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the second virial coefficients of the attractive particles and of equivalent hard spheres respectively .",
    "the law is known to work , e.g. , in relating the phase behavior of protein solutions and colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "we therefore estimate the binodal in our system by mapping onto that of baxter ` adhesive hard spheres ' @xcite  hard spheres with an infinitely short range attraction ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "we find that the shift in the vl binodal strongly depends on the value of the active force @xmath25 with which a stationary bacterium is pushing against the depletion potential .",
    "this force is approximately twice the force produced by the flagella of a free - swimming bacterium ( see @xcite and supplementary material for more details ) , which is proportional to the swimming speed , @xmath39 , of the bacteria .",
    "the measured probability density of the latter , @xmath40 , can be fitted by a schulz distribution @xcite , see fig .",
    "3b , where we indicate by dashed lines the range of speeds used for estimating the value of @xmath25 .    in fig .",
    "3c we plot the contact strength of the depletion potential @xmath41 required to trigger phase separation for the passive and active bacteria - polymer mixtures as a function of cell volume fraction .",
    "we predict that activity shifts the binodal upwards by a factor of @xmath42 , depending on the swimming speed used .",
    "since @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath1 in our system , this should translate into a corresponding shift in the experimental phase boundary .",
    "the predicted shift of the phase boundary by a factor of @xmath43 upwards has the same sign and a similar value as the observed upwards shift by a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "the latter is likely an overestimate , since sedimentation of pre - transition clusters renders the experimental phase boundary for nm cells a lower bound .",
    "( the motility of the active pre - transition clusters means that sedimentation has minimal effect on the observed phase boundary for m cells . )",
    "considering the crudeness of the approximations involved in our theory , we take such a degree of correspondence between experiment and theory as a validation of the basic physical content of our approach , viz .",
    ", that activity renders it easier for thermal fluctuations to ` free ' cells bound by interparticle attraction , an effect that we model by a shallower effective potential , fig .  3a .",
    "note that we have above neglected hydrodynamic forces .",
    "these create an attraction between two particles as they move apart , which is proportional to their relative velocity and therefore vanishes at the balance point between the active and polymer - induced forces .",
    "moreover , hydrodynamic interactions have no effect on barrier heights or phase boundaries in equilibrium systems .",
    "their neglect therefore appears justified within our quasi - equilibrium evalation of the interaction potential .",
    "the simple physical ingredients entering our effective potential theory suggest that the suppression of phase separation by activity should be generic . to test this ,",
    "we performed brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations intentionally preserving _ only _ what we think are the essential features of our experiments : motility and a short - range attraction ( depth @xmath45 ) but _ without _ hydrodynamics",
    ". specifically , we simulated a collection of brownian dumbbells ( each with local frictional drag in the lab frame ) interacting via a non - specific short - range attraction ; a constant force applied along the axis of each dumbbell renders it motile ( see materials and methods and supplementary material ) . while numerical parameters were chosen to resemble our experiments , our qualitative conclusions are valid for a much wider parameter space .",
    "our simulated system is too small to allow reliable direct estimate of the effect of activity on the position of the binodal .",
    "instead , we study how activity renormalizes the @xmath41 axis by quenching otherwise identical starting systems of active and passive attractive dumbbells to low temperatures ( large @xmath41 ) , at densities where the system forms a space - spanning gel .",
    "starting from this configuration , we performed runs at decreasing @xmath45 to locate gel melting as the point at which the potential energy per particle , @xmath46 , abruptly increased , fig .  4 .",
    "intriguingly , the melting transition in the active system appears sharper than in a passive one .",
    "more importantly for our purposes , motility increases the value of @xmath45 which is needed to stabilize the gel by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "choosing different initial conditions and densities does not much affect this result ( see supplementary materials for more details ) .",

    "1b , theory , fig .  3c , and simulations , fig .",
    "4 , on the effect of activity in renormalizing the @xmath41 axis , and the absence of system - specific features in either our theory or simulations , suggest that phase separation suppression by activity is likely generic for attractive particles .",
    ", as the temperature , measured as @xmath41 , is changed , for active ( bold ) and non - active ( thin ) particles .",
    "the energy abruptly increases as the gel melts . ]",
    "we have observed coherently - rotating pre - transition active clusters in both experiments ( supplementary movies s2 and s3 ) and simulations ( supplementary movie s4 ) .",
    "the existence of pre - transition clusters _ per se _ is unsurprising .",
    "however , their persistence ( over at least minutes in experiments ) and unidirectional rotation require explanation .",
    "first , clusters of short - range attractive particles are long - lived due to entropic reasons ( willem kegel , private communication ) .",
    "clustering in atomic systems interacting via van der waals attraction is expected at a well depth of @xmath48 .",
    "a shorter range attraction entails higher loss of entropy upon bonding , which therefore requires a larger @xmath45 .",
    "cluster life time is controlled by the escape rate of a single cell bonded to its neighbors , which itself is dominated by a boltzmann factor , @xmath49 . a quantitative estimate using the kramers formalism (",
    "see supplementary material ) returns a life time of many minutes to months ( depending on the average number of neighbors per cell we use in the calculation ) , consistent the observation of persistent clusters .",
    "secondly , since we found self - assembled rotors in our bd simulations , which did not include fluid - mediated interactions , we may rule out specifically hydrodynamic explanations for the phenomenon , and the self assembly of micro - rotors is likely generic .",
    "we now show that the quantitative features of the micro - rotor motion _ do _",
    "depend on system - specific details .",
    "the angular speed , @xmath50 , of our rotating bacterial clusters ( see materials and methods ) decreases with cluster size , @xmath51 , taken as half the arithmetic average of the longest and shortest dimensions of each cluster , fig .",
    "the data is consistent with @xmath52 , with typical @xmath50 in the range 1 - 20 rad / s .",
    "( see supplementary material for a discussion of the range of cluster sizes represented in our data . )",
    "the physical origin of cluster rotation is clear .",
    "the forces generated by the flagella bundle of each bacterium ( which hereafter we refer to as a single ( effective ) flagellum ) in a cluster do not cancel , giving a residual net torque about the cluster center .",
    "we assume that only bacteria on the surface of the cluster exert torques , implying that the total number of bacteria , @xmath53 , participating in propulsion and rotation of the cluster is equal to @xmath54 , with each bacterium occupying @xmath55 @xmath5m@xmath56 .",
    "if each bacterium exerts a torque of magnitude @xmath57 on the cluster and we assume that these torques are randomly oriented , then the total torque on the cluster , @xmath58 , is given by @xmath59 , since the sum of @xmath53 random vectors of equal length scales as @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath58 is balanced by the rotational friction , which we take to be @xmath61 , where @xmath6  cp is the solvent viscosity .",
    "thus , we predict that @xmath62 if we take each bacterium to be a force monopole of magnitude @xmath25 that contributes a torque @xmath63 , then eq .  [ random ] gives @xmath52 , which is close to our observations .    however , the total force exerted by a swimming bacterium on the fluid must sum up to zero , so that the lowest order approximation with the appropriate symmetry is not a monopole , but a dipole @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that bacterial flagella lie tangentially to the cluster surface . a small portion of the flagellum at some distance from the cluster generates a propulsion force that is transmitted through the whole flagellum to the cluster , while a force of the same magnitude and opposite direction is applied to the fluid locally",
    "the former corresponds to the monopole contribution already discussed .",
    "the latter force generates a fluid flow that has to vanish at the surface of the cluster , which exerts an extra drag force acting on the cluster that partially cancels the ` direct ' force transmitted through the flagellum . summing up the contributions from different parts of the flagellum we find ( see supplementary material ) that the torque exerted per bacterium on the surface is @xmath64 , \\label{torque}\\ ] ] with @xmath65 m being the length of a flagellum .",
    "the right hand side consists of a monopole term @xmath66 and a dipolar correction .",
    "we estimate @xmath25 as the force necessary to propel a @xmath67 m diameter sphere at speeds in the range @xmath68-@xmath69 m/s , fig .",
    "3b , giving @xmath70  pn . the prediction of eqs .",
    "[ random ] and [ torque ] for various values of @xmath25 , fig .  5 ,",
    "is compatible with the data .",
    "note that when @xmath71 , as in our experiments ( fig .",
    "5 ) , the dipolar correction in eq .",
    "[ torque ] does not effectively change the scaling , so that we may expect @xmath52 .",
    "we have assumed that the forces in a cluster add randomly and that their relative disposition is fixed .",
    "the alternative assumption that they add coherently predicts an angular velocity independent of cluster size , clearly at odds with our data in fig .",
    "while it is non - trivial to test experimentally our ` quenched disorder ' assumption , it is supported by an analysis of the ordering of active dumbbells within a rotating cluster in our bd simulations .",
    "these show that orientational ordering is largely absent , and that there is little rearrangement of the dumbbells after the clusters form ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "the neglect of hydrodynamics in our simulations is not a major shortcoming in this respect , as in the micro - rotor phase we expect intra - cluster interactions to be dominated by excluded volume , rather than hydrodynamics .",
    "being @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74pn , correspondingly.,width=220 ]",
    "we have studied phase transition and pre - transition clustering in a mixture of bacteria and non - adsorbing polymers , viewed as an active suspensions with inter - particle attraction .",
    "we find that activity suppresses phase separation compared to the case of non - motile bacteria @xcite .",
    "addition of @xmath75 times more polymer was needed to cause phase separation in a suspension of motile cells .",
    "we rationalize this by modeling the interaction between self - propelled cells by a shallower effective potential , determined by balancing the depletion force and the self propulsion .",
    "quantitative prediction of this upward shift of the phase boundary follows from the extended law of corresponding states @xcite via mapping second virial coefficients .",
    "an alternative interpretation of our results is to ascribe a higher effective temperature , @xmath76 , to our active particle system while leaving the inter - particle potential unchanged .",
    "the idea of a higher effective temperature due to activity has recently been applied to characterise the transport properties of a suspension of synthetic self - propelled colloids @xcite .",
    "each active particle undergoes a random walk in the long - time limit because the direction of its self - propelled motion is subject to thermal fluctuations ( controlled by the thermodynamic temperature @xmath77 ) @xcite .",
    "this random walk is described by an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath78 , where @xmath39 is the self - propulsion speed and @xmath79 is the ( brownian ) rotational relaxation time of an object of radius @xmath80 with ( brownian ) translational diffusion coefficient @xmath81 .",
    "palacci et al .",
    "found that @xmath82 . for our smooth swimming _",
    "e. coli _ strain , we may estimate @xmath83m@xmath56/s @xcite , m to be an estimate of the ` cell body + flagella bundle ' unit ; this is the size that controls brownian rotation . ] giving @xmath84 .",
    "this latter effective temperature for characterizing diffusive transport in the bacterial suspension is four orders of magnitude higher than the effective temperature that we may use to characterize a suspension of the same motile bacteria in the context of phase separation driven by inter - particle attraction .",
    "this ` discrepancy ' highlights an important point : there is no single parameter , ` _ the _ effective temperature ' , that is appropriate for systems away from equilibrium .",
    "indeed , the whole concept of effective temperature may be more appropriate for some situations than others . in a system such as ours ,",
    "we suggest that it is more appropriate to talk of an effective _ potential _ between particles , which is explored by fluctuations that are characterized by the thermodynamic temperature .",
    "remarkably , when the inter - particle attraction is just too weak to cause phase separation , we observe finite clusters that individually break chiral symmetry and rotate unidirectionally .",
    "the spontaneous formation of these micro - rotors constitutes a clear demonstration of the self assembly of functional structures from active suspensions .",
    "we accounted for the observed scaling of cluster rotation speed with cluster size using a hydrodynamic theory .",
    "these ` active clusters ' show minimal sedimentation : their motion confers a high effective temperature in the diffusive sense @xcite .",
    "we have also simulated brownian dumbbells each subject to a body force directed along its axis and with a short - range inter - particle attraction , with parameters chosen to mimic our experimental bacteria - polymer mixtures .",
    "our theoretical framework is also able to account for the melting of gel states in the simulated system , which we take to be a surrogate for the phase boundary in our small simulations .",
    "moreover , clusters in the melted state also show spontaneous rotation .",
    "our experimental system is a very specific one : living bacteria propelled by rotating flagella bundles operating via low - reynolds number hydrodynamics in a chemically - complex buffer with added non - adsorbing polymer ; the latter causes a short - range inter - particle attraction via the depletion mechanism . our phenomenological theory and simulations strip away many of these system - specific features .",
    "the success of the theory and simulations in reproducing experimentally observed phase separation suppression and the self assembly of rotating clusters suggest strongly that these are generic features in attractive active particle systems .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to look for such effects not only in suspensions of other bacteria , but also in suspensions of self - propelled ` janus ' particles @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the competition for ` fuel ' among neighboring particles may act to limit cluster sizes .",
    "finally , we point out that our bacterial suspensions contain a fraction of non - motile organisms @xcite . in the presence of polymer",
    ", these cells should be the first to aggregate , producing ` nuclei ' for the subsequent aggregation of motile cells .",
    "preliminary bd simulations of mixtures of motile and non - motile attractive dumbbells support this picture , which motivates our assumption that cluster rotation and translation are powered by motile cells on the outside .",
    "it also points to possible relevance of our work for aquatic and marine ecology : bacteria aggregating in the presence of non - living organic particulate matter ( detritus ) can trap the latter and keep it suspended for the water column food chain @xcite .",
    "we used _ e. coli _",
    "strain hcb437 , a smooth - swimming mutant .",

    "<S> our work therefore opens up a novel route to self - assembled structures , by exploiting motile activity directly .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the angular velocities of our self - assembled bacterial rotors approximately scale as their inverse size . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a hydrodynamic theory which explains this finding , by assuming that the bacteria on the surface of the clusters exert torques that add up randomly to give a unidirectional , clockwise or anti - clockwise , rotation . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations provide further evidence for this picture , showing that collisions between active particles lead to their random ordering in the rotating clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the only ingredients necessary to explain all our observations are self - propulsion and a non - specific short - range inter - particle attraction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the suppression of phase separation and the self - assembly of active rotors should be _ generic _ features across a wide range of active systems . </S>"
