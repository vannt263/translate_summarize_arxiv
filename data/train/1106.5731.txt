    "mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are rich in emission features , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , molecular hydrogen and prominent forbidden emission lines @xcite .",
    "another spectral feature commonly observed in agns is silicate at @xmath12 9.7@xmath0 m and 18@xmath0 m , both in emission and absorption .",
    "the agn unified model proposes the existence of a dense concentration of absorbing material surrounding the central engine in a toroidal distribution , which blocks the broad line region ( blr ) emission from the line of sight in seyfert 2 ( sy2 ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet clear if the molecular gas and dust detected in mid - ir spectra is actually associated with the absorbing material required by the so - called torus in the unified model .",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of the silicate feature strengths in a sample of 196 agns and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "they found that the spectra of quasars and seyfert  1 ( sy1 ) galaxies are characterized by silicate features in emission , with few sy1s presenting weak absorptions .",
    "in contrast , sy2 spectra are dominated by weak silicate absorption .",
    "these results suggest that the silicate emission ( or absorption ) is related to the line of sight , in the framework of the agn unified model .",
    "in addition , most of the ulirgs show very deep silicate absorption @xcite .    the silicate behavior in agns can be explained using nenkova s torus models @xcite , which consider an ensemble of individual clouds instead of the standard `` solid doughnut '' .",
    "@xcite detected the silicate emission feature in the sy2 galaxy ngc2110 , and compared it with the @xcite clumpy torus models , demonstrating that the presence of silicate emission can also be explained by an edge - on clumpy distribution . from their best - fit model , they conclude that there would be a small number of clouds along the line of sight , with a distribution that does not extend far above the torus equatorial plane .",
    "according to @xcite the presence of strong silicate absorption and the absence of pah features in some active galaxies , can be interpreted as extremely heavily obscuration in these sources .",
    "an example of such an object is ngc3281 .",
    "its spectrum shows a very deep silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath0 m , as well as the forbidden emission lines [ siii]18.7@xmath0 m , [ siv]10.5@xmath0 m , [ neii]12.8@xmath0 m , [ neiii]15.5@xmath0 m , [ nev]14.3@xmath0 m and 24.3@xmath0 m , [ nevi]7.6@xmath0 m and [ oiv]25.8@xmath0 m . no pah emission was detected in the spitzer spectrum @xcite .",
    "in addition , ngc3281 is a luminous infrared galaxy ( logl@xmath13 10.73l@xmath14 , * ? ? ? * ) , classified as a sy2 .",
    "its optical spectrum was studied by @xcite , finding that the kinematics of the kpc extended ionized gas can be described by rotation in a plane , with material outflowing ( @xmath15150 km s@xmath16 ) from the nucleus within a conical structure .",
    "they also suggest that ngc3281 has dust asymmetrically distributed with respect to the ionized gas .",
    "in addition , using advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( _ asca _ ) data , @xcite found that ngc3281 shows an extremely complex x - ray spectrum , with a prominent iron emission line and a large absorbing column density ( n@xmath17 7.1@xmath181.2 @xmath19 10@xmath20@xmath21 ) that when combined with the nuclear extinction inferred from the near - infrared color analysis ( a@xmath22 = 22@xmath1811mag ) , results in a n@xmath23/a@xmath22 ratio one order of magnitude higher than that of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this effect was attributed to an optically thick material along the line of sight of both the x - ray and the infrared emitting regions , which obscures the entire x - ray source but only a fraction of the much larger ir emitting region .",
    "later , @xcite using the italian - dutch satellite _ bepposax _ , found a n@xmath23/a@xmath22 ratio about twice that derived by @xcite , adding ngc3281 to the list of agns presenting dust properties different from the galaxy .",
    "the difference in the n@xmath23/a@xmath22 values derived by both studies , according to @xcite , is due to the limited _ asca _ band - pass .",
    "@xcite also show that its x - ray spectrum ( e@xmath2410kev ) is reflection - dominated , with a relatively strong k@xmath10 iron emission line and a heavily absorbed nuclear continuum ( n@xmath25 10@xmath26@xmath21 ) .",
    "hence , they classify ngc3281 as a compton - thick galaxy . the high values found for the absorption column density in ngc3281 also explain the extremely high ratio f@xmath27\\,}}$]/f@xmath28 @xmath11 0.3 , when compared to the average ( @xmath11 0.02 ) value obtained for a sample of sy2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "it follows from the above discussion that this galaxy has a very heavily obscured nucleus , which makes it a key object to study whether or not the observed dust absortion is associated with the dusty torus of the unified model .",
    "thus , it may provide unambiguous observational evidence of this structure .",
    "we present in this paper ground bases mid - ir high - angular resolution spectra of the galaxy ngc3281 .",
    "the thermal - region camera spectrograph ( t - recs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) attached to the gemini south telescope give a spatial resolution of 16 pc / pix , which is very adequate to study the dust distribution in the @xmath12 200pc central radius of this galaxy .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ observation ] we describe the observation and data reduction processes .",
    "results are discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "summary and conclusion are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "ground - based mid - ir observations of ngc3281 were obtained with the t - recs in queue mode at gemini south , in 2009 april 06 ut , as part of program gs-2009a - q-34 .",
    "conditions were clear , with water vapor column in the range 58 mm , and image quality of 033 in the n band , as measured from the acquisition images of the telluric standards observed right before and/or after the science frames .",
    "all observations used a standard chop - nod technique to remove time - variable sky background , telescope thermal emission , and the effect of 1/_f _ noise from the array / electronics .",
    "the slit was oriented along pa = 315 , with a chop throw of 15 , oriented along pa = 225 , perpendicular to the slit direction , in order to include only the signal of the guided beam position in the frame and avoid possible nod effects in the spatial direction .",
    "the same slit position / nod orientation were used for the telluric standards .",
    "the instrument configuration used the low - resolution ( r @xmath12 100 ) grating and the 036 slit , for a dispersion of 0.0223@xmath0m / pixel and a spectral resolution of 0.08@xmath0 m .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.089 arcsec / pixel in the spatial direction , and the slit is 216 long .",
    "spectral coverage was of 7.1@xmath0 m centered at 10.5@xmath0 m .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 980 sec .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the midir and gnirs sub - packages of gemini iraf package . to extract the final spectrum , we combined the chop- and nod - subtracted frames using the tasks tprepare and mistack in the midir package .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained from the sky lines in the raw frames . to remove the telluric absorption lines from the galaxy spectrum , we divided the extracted spectrum for each observing night by that of the telluric standard stars hd3438 or hd4786 @xcite , observed before and/or after the science target . finally , the spectrum was flux calibrated by interpolating a black - body function to the spectrum of the telluric standard . for this step we used the task mstelluric in the midir package .",

    "panel c shows that the n - band galaxy luminosity profile is extended with respect to that of the n - band stellar profile of hr3438 .",
    "we extracted seven one dimensional ( 1d ) spectra : one centered in the unresolved nucleus ( 4-pixel = 0.36 arcsec , which corresponds to @xmath1265 pc for a distance of 43 mpc , using h@xmath29 = 74 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 ) , plus extractions centered at 130pc , 195pc and 260pc to the northwest ( nw ) and southeast ( se ) directions .",
    "deep silicate absorption is observed at the nucleus and at 130pc in both nw and se directions of the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "the extraction at 195pc nw shows a weak absorption . the remaining extraction does not present silicate absorption .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the dust is concentrated inside a radius of 200pc .",
    "the ngc3281 t - recs spectra ( fig . [ spectra ] ) clearly show that a deep silicate absorption , as well as the [ siv]10.5@xmath0 m and [ neii]12.7@xmath0 m emission lines , are observed up to 130 pc from the nucleus .",
    "in addition , pah emission bands are not detected in the spectra , in agreement with the spitzer spectrum @xcite . as discussed in the introduction , ngc3281 is one exception among sy  2 galaxies , as most ( @xmath1280% ) of the objects in this class present pah emission bands and no deep silicate absorption in their mid - ir spectra @xcite .    in order to estimate the silicate absorption apparent strength ( @xmath30 ) ,",

    "the remaining three extraction have similar values to that of the nucleus .",
    "when dealing with dusty sources , a more physical parameter is the line of sight depth ( @xmath36 ) , which can be estimated from s@xmath34 at 9.7@xmath0 m using the equation @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can derive the apparent optical extinction using a@xmath38 = @xmath3918.5@xmath182 mag @xcite .",

    "[ lines ] that the position labeled as 1 ( 130pc from the nucleus at nw direction ) presents a slightly higher extinction than the central one ( a@xmath2 = 28@xmath188 mag ) .    to estimate in a more robust way the line of sight depth at 9.7  ( @xmath40 ) in ngc3281 we used the pahfit code @xcite , which assumes that the source spectrum is composed by continuum emission from dust and starlight , prominent emission lines , individual and blended pah emission bands , and that the light is attenuated by extinction due to silicate grains .",
    "pahfit models the extinction using the dust opacity law of @xcite , where the infrared extinction is considered as a power law plus silicate features peaking at 9.7@xmath0 m . for details see @xcite .",
    "we used this approach to determine the contribution of the distinct components to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc 3281 as a function of the distance to the galaxy centre .",

    "these results are in agreement with the unified agn model , which requires the presence of a dusty structure that obscures the broad line region in sy  2 galaxies . from the fitted models we would be looking in a direction nearby of the torus equator ( @xmath5 = 60@xmath6 )    in general , the torus parameters derived here are similar to those obtained by @xcite , except for the number of clouds and optical depth per single cloud , where they find only 5 clouds with @xmath4 = 10 in the equatorial radius",

    "using the above , we can then derive a column density of n@xmath61 for the uncontaminated nuclear spectrum of ngc3281 , which is consistent with the values derived by @xcite from x - ray observations ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite demonstrated that for heavily obscured agn the iron k@xmath10 ew values depend on the torus geometry .",
    "we compare the torus geometrical parameters derived in our paper with those of @xcite , and found that the present torus aperture ( @xmath48 = 70@xmath6 ) correspond to @xmath63 = 20@xmath6 in the @xcite s models .",

    "<S> we present mid infrared ( mid - ir ) spectra of the compton - thick seyfert 2 galaxy ngc3281 , obtained with the thermal - region camera spectrograph ( t - recs ) at the gemini south telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra present a very deep silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath0 m , and [ siv]10.5@xmath0 m and [ neii]12.7@xmath0 m ionic lines , but no evidence of pah emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the nuclear optical extinction is in the range 24 @xmath1 a@xmath2 @xmath1 83mag . </S>",
    "<S> a temperature t = 300k was found for the black - body dust continuum component of the unresolved 65pc nucleus and at 130pc se , while the region at 130pc reveals a colder temperature ( 200k ) . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the nuclear spectrum of ngc3281 using a clumpy torus model that suggests that the nucleus of this galaxy hosts a dusty toroidal structure . </S>",
    "<S> according to this model , the ratio between the inner and outer radius of the torus in ngc3281 is @xmath3 = 20 , with 14 clouds in the equatorial radius with optical depth of @xmath4 = 40mag . </S>",
    "<S> we would be looking in the direction of the torus equatorial radius ( @xmath5 = 60@xmath6 ) , which has outer radius of r@xmath7 11pc . </S>",
    "<S> the column density is n@xmath81.2@xmath9 and iron k@xmath10 equivalent width ( @xmath11 0.5 - 1.2kev ) are used to check the torus geometry . </S>",
    "<S> our findings indicate that the x - ray absorbing column density , which classifies ngc3281 as a compton - thick source , may also be responsible for the absorption at 9.7@xmath0 m providing strong evidence that the silicate dust responsible for this absorption can be located in the agn torus . </S>"
