    "among the presently known types of carbon stars , only the ch stars have abundances and kinematics which are indicative of membership in the galactic halo ( mcclure 1985 ) . since stars of mass m @xmath7 0.8m@xmath8 are not thought to experience the third dredge - up mechanism during their ascent of the asymptotic giant branch ( e.g. , iben 1975 ) , the origin of the enhanced abundances of carbon and _",
    "s_-process elements in these giants remained a puzzle until the discovery that _ all _ field ch stars are binaries composed of a red - giant primary and a degenerate ( i.e. , white dwarf ) secondary ( mcclure 1984 ; mcclure & woodsworth 1990 ) .",
    "the peculiar abundances of these objects are therefore thought to be the result of mass exchange via stellar winds or roche - lobe overflow during the ascent of the white - dwarf progenitor up the asymptotic giant branch ( han et al .",
    "clearly , the discovery of _ globular cluster _ ch stars would have important implications not only for nucleogenesis and globular cluster abundance anomalies ( pilachowski et al . 1996 ) , but also for the formation , evolution and destruction of binaries in dense environments ( hut et al . 1992 ) .",
    "however , searches for ch stars in several globular clusters based on spectroscopic surveys of brightest cluster members ( harding 1962 ) , direct imaging through intermediate - band filters ( palmer 1980 ; palmer & wing 1982 ) , and transmission - grating slitless spectroscopy ( bond 1975 ) , have proved , by and large , unsuccessful . at present , a handful of stars having enhanced carbon and _",
    "s_-process elements have been reported in each of @xmath6  cen ( e.g. , harding 1962 ; dickens 1972 ; bond 1975 ) , m22 ( hesser , hartwick & mcclure 1977 ; mcclure & norris 1977 ; hesser & harris 1979 ) , m55 ( smith & norris 1982 ) and m2 ( zinn 1981 ) . however , while the spectra of these stars _ are _ characterized by abnormally high ch absorption compared to other cluster giants , they usually do _ not _ show strong swan bands of c@xmath5 , suggesting that their anomalous carbon abundances probably arise through a different mechanism , such as incomplete cn processing ( vanture & wallerstein 1992 ) , than that operating in  classical \" ch stars .",
    "indeed , among this sample of ch - enhanced stars in globular clusters , only two are likely to be genuine ch stars . both of these stars , rgo 55 ( harding 1962 ) and rgo 70 ( dickens 1972 ) , are found in @xmath6  cen .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the serendipitous discovery of a carbon star in the core of the poorly - studied globular cluster m14 and argue that it is likely to be a  classical \" ch star : a post mass - transfer binary consisting of a red giant primary and a white dwarf secondary ( mcclure & woodsworth 1990 ) .",
    "during an observing run in may 1996 intended to measure radial velocities and mg _ b _ line strengths for globular clusters surrounding the supergiant elliptical galaxy m87 , we used the mos imaging spectrograph on the canada - france - hawaii telescope to obtain long - slit comparison spectra of the integrated light of several galactic globular clusters . during the integrations ,",
    "the telescope was allowed to drift , typically through a spatial extent of about one arcminute , in a direction ( s @xmath9 n ) perpendicular to the slit in order to generate a spectrum representative of the integrated light of the cluster .",
    "all spectra were accumulated using the b400 grism and stis2 ccd which combine to give a dispersion of 3.6   pixel@xmath1 and a resolution of @xmath7 8   .",
    "a blocking filter was used to restrict the wavelength region to 4500  5700  .",
    "unexpectedly , the long - slit spectrum of the integrated light of the galactic globular cluster m14 , obtained on 19 may 1996 , showed strong swan bands of c@xmath5 indicating the presence of a carbon star in the cluster core .",
    "because of the driftscaning technique employed , the immediate identification of the carbon star was in some doubt . by good fortune , however , the carbon star has few bright neighbors to the north or south , allowing a probable identification of the candidate based on its e - w position ( see figure 1 ) . on 20 may 1996",
    ", we obtained a 600s spectroscopic exposure of the suspected carbon star , this time using a 1@xmath10@xmath1110@xmath10 slit .",
    "the blocking filter was removed to extend the spectral coverage to the region 4000  8000  . after standard preprocessing",
    ", the carbon star spectrum was traced , extracted and wavelength calibrated using iraf .",
    "the final spectrum is shown in figure 2 .",
    "of the three published color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for m14 ( e.g. , smith - kogon , wehlau & demers 1974 ; shara et al .",
    "1986 ; margon et al .",
    "1991 ) , only the photographic study of smith - kogon , wehlau & demers ( 1974 ) includes stars brighter than the cluster horizontal branch .",
    "unfortunately , these authors did not publish magnitudes , colors or finding charts for their program stars . therefore , to determine the location of the carbon star in the cluster cmd , we obtained a number of @xmath12 and @xmath13 images of m14 using mos on 19 and 22 may 1996 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "all frames were then reduced using daophot ii ( stetson et al .",
    "empirically we found that the cmd based on the two poorest seeing frames ( fwhm @xmath7 11 ) exhibited less scatter , reflecting the severe mos undersampling ( 044 pixels ) in the other frames .",
    "our instrumental magnitudes were then calibrated using eight unsaturated local photoelectric standard stars ( smith - kogon , wehlau & demers 1974 ) .",
    "these stars span a magnitude range of 12.46 @xmath14 @xmath13 @xmath14 14.59 and a color range of 1.17 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath14 2.05 .",
    "the internal random errors in the calibration are @xmath16 0.02 in @xmath13 and @xmath16 0.04 in @xmath17 .      although the carbon star s small offset of 138 @xmath7 0.3@xmath18 from the cluster center ( shawl & white 1986 ; trager , king & djorgovski 1995 ) and its position near the tip of the cluster red giant branch ( see figure 3 ) suggest that it is physically associated with the cluster , radial velocities for both the carbon star and m14 are needed to provide unambiguous evidence of membership .",
    "in particular , radial velocities are needed to eliminate the possibility that the object is a carbon - rich dwarf residing in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , green et al .",
    "1994 ) , although the _ a  priori _ probability of this is low : to a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 = 18 , the surface density of faint , high - latitude carbon stars ( of which dwarf carbon stars make up @xmath16 13% ) is @xmath16 0.02 deg@xmath19 ( green et al .",
    "moreover , the mos spectrum ( figure 2 ) shows only a weak c@xmath5 bandhead at 6191  , a feature which green et al .",
    "( 1992 ) suggest to be unusually strong in the spectra of dwarf carbon stars .",
    "finally , if the star in question _ were _ a nearby dwarf , it might be expected to show a measureable proper motion .",
    "comparison of our cfht images with a photographic plate taken in 1952 with the mt .",
    "wilson telescope ( see figure 1 of wehlau & froelich 1994 ) shows no evidence for such a proper motion .    on 18 - 19 july 1996",
    ", we used the hydra fiber positioner and bench - mounted echelle spectrograph on the wiyn telescope to measure 505 radial velocities ( median precision @xmath7 1.3 km s@xmath1 ) for 493 stars in a @xmath7 0.5 deg@xmath20 field centered on m14 .",
    "in the course of this survey ( ct & welch 1997 ) , we also obtained an 1800s spectroscopic exposure of the m14 carbon star at a resolution @xmath7 0.33   over the spectral range 4983  5252  .",
    "after the program spectra were traced , extracted and wavelength - calibrated using iraf , they were cross - correlated against a template spectrum of hd223094 , a k5iii radial velocity standard . in the case of the carbon star spectrum , the adopted template was hd156074 , an r star which is known to have a constant heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath21 km s@xmath1 ( mcclure 1996 ) .",
    "from our hydra spectrum of the carbon star , we measure a radial velocity of @xmath22 km s@xmath1 ( heliocentric julian date = 2450282.761 ) . how does this compare to the systemic velocity of m14 ?",
    "available radial velocity measurements for this cluster have been reviewed by webbink ( 1981 ) , who quotes a weighted mean velocity of @xmath23 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this value is based primarily on low - dispersion spectra of the integrated cluster light obtained by mayall ( 1946 ) , as well as a small number of radial velocities ( spanning the range + 9 to @xmath24153 km s@xmath1 ) for four type ii cepheids in the field of m14 accumulated by joy ( 1949 ) .",
    "an image - tube spectrogram obtained by hesser , shawl & meyer ( 1986 ) of the integrated cluster light yielded a radial velocity of @xmath25 km s@xmath1 .",
    "given the obvious difficulties with field star contamination in this direction ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , as well as the large uncertainties of the mayall ( 1946 ) velocities ( typical internal error @xmath7 33 km s@xmath1 , but potentially much larger external errors ; see hesser , shawl & meyer 1986 ) , we have used our new sample of hydra velocities to determine improved estimates of the systemic velocity and internal dispersion of m14 .",
    "we define a sample of probable m14 members by restricting ourselves to those stars which lie within two half - light radii @xmath28 of the cluster center ( i.e. , 2@xmath29 26 ; trager , king & djorgovski 1995 ) .",
    "this sample consists of 20 stars which have a median velocity uncertainty of 1.2 km s@xmath1 and span",
    "the range @xmath30 km s@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath31 photometry for these stars ( see figure 3 ) demonstrates that they are all likely to be cluster members since they define a smooth red giant branch extending from @xmath13 = 14.38 to 16.23 . from this sample ,",
    "we find a mean velocity of @xmath32 km s@xmath1 and a one dimensional cluster velocity dispersion of @xmath33 km s@xmath1 using the maximum - likelihood estimators of pryor & meylan ( 1993 ) . based on the close agreement between the radial velocity of the carbon star and that of m14 , we conclude that the star is indeed a cluster member .",
    "we also note that , if the star in question is similar to the field ch stars studied by mcclure & woodsworth ( 1990 ) , an additional velocity component due to the orbital motion of the red giant primary around the center of mass of the system is expected ; among the eight ch stars monitored by mcclure & woodsworth ( 1990 ) , the velocity semi - amplitudes ranged from 4.3 to 12.1 km s@xmath1 , with a mean of 8.1 km s@xmath1 .",
    "radial velocity surveys of field ch stars have provided compelling evidence that _ all _ of these systems are post mass - transfer binaries .",
    "we therefore conclude that the carbon star in m14 is very likely to be a spectroscopic binary having a white dwarf secondary , although _ confirmation _ of duplicity must await additional radial velocity measurements .",
    "it is perhaps notable that , as the only two clusters known to contain candidate or confirmed ch stars , m14 and @xmath6  cen are both massive , low - concentration systems .",
    "a possible connection between cluster concentration and ch enhancement was noted previously by mcclure & norris ( 1977 ) who , in a prescient remark , suggested that  searches for ch stars in the low - concentration clusters m14 and ngc 2419 might be profitable \" .    does environment play a role in the evolution of globular cluster ch stars ?",
    "the dominant dynamical processes affecting binaries in globular clusters are the _ disruption _ of  soft \" binaries through stellar encounters and the _ shrinking _ of the orbits of  hard \" binaries via energy exchanges with intruder stars ( e.g. , hut et al .",
    "equation ( 1 ) of hills ( 1984 ) can be used to estimate the separation , @xmath34 , of the widest cluster binaries which are expected to have escaped disruption over a hubble time .",
    "since most galactic globular clusters have three - dimensional velocity dispersions @xmath35 km s@xmath1 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) , we find @xmath34 @xmath36 6 au .",
    "this is comparable to the separation of the _ widest _ binaries in the mcclure & woodsworth ( 1990 ) sample of field ch stars ( i.e. , 1 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath37 4.5 au ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the process of ch - star disruption is unlikely to be important for most clusters .    on the other hand , the shrinking of hard binaries may play a more significant role . at the cluster center",
    ", intruder stars will shrink the orbits of hard binaries at the rate @xmath39 where @xmath38 is the semi - major axis of the binary , @xmath40 is the central one - dimensional velocity dispersion and @xmath41 is the central mass density ( hills 1984 ; phinney 1996 ) .",
    "integration of this equation yields the initial semimajor axis @xmath42 of the binary whose size is halved over the lifetime , @xmath43 , of a cluster : @xmath44 the orbits of hard binaries that are initially wider than this shrink rapidly , and have @xmath45 after a hubble time .",
    "conversely , tighter binaries evolve on rather longer timescales , and are largely unaffected .",
    "thus , @xmath42 is the characteristic final separation of surviving cluster binaries ( phinney 1996 ) .",
    "it is worth bearing in mind , however , that equation ( 2 ) refers to the cluster center ; the situation for the cluster as a whole is undoubtedly more complicated .    in figure 4",
    "we plot the distribution of @xmath42 against absolute magnitude , @xmath46 , for all galactic globular clusters ( filled circles ) having measured velocity dispersions and central mass densities ( e.g. , see pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "absolute magnitudes are taken from djorgovski ( 1993 ) .",
    "m14 and @xmath6  cen are shown as open stars .",
    "the open squares show the location of the galactic dsph galaxies ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) . at least _ some _ of the carbon stars seen in several of these galaxies ( i.e. , ursa minor , draco , sculptor and carina ) are likely to be ch stars ( mcclure 1984 ; aaronson & olszewski 1987 ; armandroff , olszewski & pryor 1995 ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the semi - major axis of the shortest - period binary in the mcclure & woodsworth ( 1990 ) sample of field ch stars ( i.e. , @xmath47 1 au ) .",
    "this size is similar to the mean radii of low - mass , thermally - pulsating agb stars ( e.g. , see figure 2 of boothroyd & sackman 1988 ) .",
    "closer initial binary orbits would disrupt the normal evolution of the carbon donor before it reached the thermally - pulsating agb phase , preventing the dredge - up of carbon .",
    "therefore , figure 4 suggests that the low concentrations of m14 and @xmath6  cen correspond to small values of @xmath48 , and hence to @xmath42 large enough to accomodate ch systems with separations typical of field ch stars .",
    "the discovery of a ch star in m14 therefore provides additional support for the notion ( mcclure 1984 ) that the process of ch star formation depends on environment , in particular , on the rate of hard binary shrinking through stellar encounters .",
    "given the incomplete and inhomogenous nature of existing surveys for ch stars in globular clusters , a renewed effort to discover such objects in an expanded sample of clusters ( particularly those objects which lie _ above _ the dashed line in figure 4 ) may provide new insights into the influence of environment on binary evolution .",
    "the authors thank the staffs of the cfh and wiyn telescopes for their outstanding support .",
    "thanks also to robert mcclure and amelia wehlau for helpful discussions .",
