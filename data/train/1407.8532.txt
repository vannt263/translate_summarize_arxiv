    "<S> we employ the lattice qcd data on taylor expansion coefficients up to sixth order to construct an equation of state at finite net - baryon density . </S>",
    "<S> when we take into account how hadron masses depend on lattice spacing and quark mass , the coefficients evaluated using the p4 action are equal to those of hadron resonance gas at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> thus the parametrised equation of state can be smoothly connected to the hadron resonance gas equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the equation of state using taylor coefficients up to second order is realistic only at low densities , and that at densities corresponding to @xmath0 , the expansion converges by the sixth order term .    </S>",
    "<S> lattice qcd , equation of state , hadron resonance gas    [ [ section ] ]    one of the methods to extend the lattice qcd calculations to non - zero chemical potential is taylor expansion of pressure in chemical potentials : @xmath1 the coefficients of this expansion are derivatives of pressure , @xmath2 , with respect to baryon and strangeness chemical potentials , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is temperature throughout the text . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice qcd calculations of these coefficients have matured to a level where both budapest - wuppertal  @xcite and hotqcd  @xcite collaborations have published the final continuum extrapolated results for the second order taylor coefficients , see fig .  [ second ] .        as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ second ] , at low temperatures the coefficients evaluated using the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model agree with the lattice qcd results . </S>",
    "<S> thus we may expect that hrg is an acceptable approximation of the physical equation of state also at finite net - baryon densities . to check </S>",
    "<S> how soon one may truncate the expansion in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pt4 ] ) , we calculate the taylor coefficients in hrg up to sixth order , evaluate the pressure using up to second , fourth or sixth order taylor coefficients , and compare to the actual hrg pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hrg ] , where the pressure at constant @xmath7 mev temperature is shown as a function of inverse of entropy per baryon , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath8 as variable to facilitate easy comparison to heavy - ion collisions at various energies since , unlike net - baryon density @xmath9 , or baryon chemical potential @xmath3 , @xmath10 is ( approximately ) constant during the entire expansion stage of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> we remind that at midrapidity the relevant entropy per baryon is @xmath11 , 100 , 65 , and 40 at collision energies @xmath12 , 64 , 39 , and 17 gev/@xmath13 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus an equation of state based on second order taylor coefficients only  @xcite can be expected to be realistic only at relatively low net - baryon densities , @xmath14 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , at collisions with collision energy @xmath15 gev .            </S>",
    "<S> the taylor coefficients have been evaluated on lattice up to sixth order  @xcite , but unfortunately the fourth and sixth order coefficients suffer from large discretisation errors . </S>",
    "<S> as we have argued previously  @xcite , these errors are mostly due to the lattice discretisation effects on hadron masses : when the hadron mass spectrum is modified accordingly ( for details see  @xcite ) , the hrg model reproduces the lattice data , see fig .  1 of ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly this change can be accounted for by shifting the modified hrg result of purely baryonic coefficients towards lower temperature by 30 mev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on this finding , and because the lattice data agree so well with the modified hrg , we suggest that cutoff effects can be accounted for by shifting the p4 lattice data by 30 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth and sixth order coefficients are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ stamps ] , where the data below 206 mev has been shifted by 30 mev , the data point at 209 mev by 15 mev ( open symbol ) , and the points above 209 mev have not been shifted . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the shifted data now agrees with the unmodified hrg .    </S>",
    "<S> we parametrise the shifted p4 data , and the unshifted , continuum extrapolated stout and hisq data , using an inverse polynomial of five ( second order ) or six ( fourth and sixth order coefficients ) terms : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stefan - boltzmann value of the particular coefficient , @xmath18 are the parameters , and the powers @xmath19 are required to be integers between 1 and 23 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 with scaling factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 gev for the second order coefficients and @xmath23 gev and @xmath24 gev for all other coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we match the parametrisation of second order coefficients to the hrg value at temperature @xmath25 mev , and the fourth and sixth order coefficients at @xmath26 mev by requiring that the taylor coefficient and its first , second , and third derivatives are continuous . </S>",
    "<S> the switching temperatures have been chosen to optimise the fit and lead to smooth behaviour of the speed of sound ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sos ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints fix four ( or five ) of the parameters @xmath18 . the remaining parameters are fixed by a @xmath27 fit to the lattice data . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting parametrizations are shown as solid curves in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ second ] and  [ stamps ] .        </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the pressure at @xmath28 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the coefficient @xmath29 , from the continuum extrapolated stout data for the trace anomaly @xmath30  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which agree with the very recent hisq data  @xcite within errors . as in our earlier parametrisation of trace anomaly  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we fit the lattice result using an inverse polynomial with four terms , and connect it to the hrg trace anomaly at @xmath31 mev temperature , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ trace ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we characterise the equation of state in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sos]a by showing the square of the speed of sound , @xmath32 , on various isentropic curves with constant entropy per baryon . </S>",
    "<S> the curves at @xmath33 , 65 , and 40 are relevant at collision energies @xmath34 , 39 and 17 gev , respectively . at @xmath33 ( </S>",
    "<S> dotted line ) , the equation of state is basically identical to the equation of state at @xmath28 ( thin solid line ) . at larger baryon densities </S>",
    "<S> the effect of finite baryon density is no longer negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the larger the density , the stiffer the equation of state above , and softer below the transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we see some ripples forming in the transition region with decreasing @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> these ripples grow fast with increasing density when one goes beyond @xmath35 , and therefore we consider @xmath35 to give a practical maximum density for our parametrisation .    on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sos]b we have evaluated the square of the speed of sound along the isentropic @xmath35 curve using taylor coefficients up to second , fourth and sixth order . at temperatures above the transition region </S>",
    "<S> they all lead to very similar speed of sound , but below @xmath36 mev , the second order result deviates strongly from the fourth and sixth order results . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that at low temperatures equation of state based on the second order coefficients only is not sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the small difference between the fourth and sixth order equation of state indicates that if @xmath37 , the expansion has basically converged by the sixth order term .    , as a function of temperature on various isentropic curves with constant entropy per baryon ( a ) , and on @xmath35 curve evaluated using fourier coefficients up to second , fourth or sixth order ( b).,width=472 ]    to summarise we have argued that an equation of state based on the taylor expansion up to second order , is realistic only in collisions with larger collision energy than at the rhic beam energy scan . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the temperature shift of 30 mev is a good approximation of the discretisation effects in the lattice qcd data obtained using p4 action . </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed an equation of state for finite baryon densities based on hadron resonance gas and lattice qcd data . </S>",
    "<S> in such an equation of state , the taylor expansion essentially converges by the sixth order term if @xmath0 . </S>"
