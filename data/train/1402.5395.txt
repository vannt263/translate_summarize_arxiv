    "<S> , a natural conjecture is that any deviation from the monotonically increasing behavior of @xmath3 is an indication of non - markovianity . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this conjecture is indeed true .    </S>",
    "<S> we suppose a dynamical quantum process described by a time - local master equation of the form @xmath14 where the lindbladian super - operator @xmath15 @xcite is given by @xmath16\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{i}\\gamma_{i}(t)\\left[a_i(t)\\rho a_i(t)^\\dagger-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{a_i(t)^\\dagger a_i(t),\\rho\\right\\}\\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath18 are the decay rates , and @xmath19 are the lindblad operators . the master equation given above leads to a conventional markovian process , </S>",

    "<S> we should also emphasize that the time dependent decay rates @xmath18 may take negative values temporarily throughout the dynamics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this is closely related to the violation of the divisibility property of a quantum process , described by a master equation of the form of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ master ] ) , since the dynamical map @xmath28 is no longer cptp when we have @xmath29 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the amount of deviation from the divisibility of a given dynamical map is the essence of entanglement - based measures of non - markovianity . </S>",
    "<S> since the entanglement shared by a system and an isolated ancilla can not increase under local cptp operations , it follows from the composition law that any entanglement measure has to monotonically decrease for all divisible processes @xcite . here , we define our measure in a slightly different way as compared to the recipe given by rhp . </S>",
    "<S> we sum the overall increase of @xmath4 throughout the whole time evolution , and , in addition , we include an optimization procedure over all possible initial states since any reliable measure should be independent of the initial parameters of the system . under these considerations , </S>",
    "<S> our entanglement - based measure takes the form @xmath30 where the maximization is taken over all possible pure initial states of the bipartite system @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we specifically choose the eof to quantify the amount of bipartite entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this choice is what enables us to relate the entanglement between the system @xmath1 and the apparatus @xmath2 to the maximum amount of classical information that the environment @xmath0 can access about the system @xmath1 , in a simple way . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also note that the eof has the advantage of being a resource - based measure , meaning that it quantifies the cost of generating a given state by means of maximally entangled resources . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the initial state of the environment @xmath0 is pure . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the tripartite state @xmath6 is pure and therefore , the koashi - winter relation implies @xcite @xmath31 now , it is very important to recall that the isolated system @xmath1 does not directly interact with the environment @xmath0 , and as a result , its reduced density matrix @xmath9 is time invariant when the subsystem @xmath32 is traced over . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , taking the time derivative of the above equation , we obtain @xmath33 this relation clearly tells us that any temporary increase in @xmath4 , during the dynamics of the open system , implies a temporary decrease in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , deviation from the property of divisibility can be signaled by a temporary decrease of @xmath3 , which is a direct entropic measure of information . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , if the amount of information that the environment @xmath0 can access about the system @xmath1 decreases for a time interval , then the considered quantum process is no longer markovian . note that it might be possible for certain nondivisible processes that @xmath4 decays monotonically . </S>",
    "<S> however , in such cases , our proposal in terms of information flow can be adopted as a criterion for non - markovianity on its own .    to illustrate the importance of the above relation </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the system @xmath1 initially correlated to the apparatus @xmath2 , which is given by a two - level ( qubit ) system . also , the apparatus is in contact with a zero temperature reservoir , modeled as a collection of harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> effectively , the reservoir induces an amplitude damping process only on the apparatus @xmath2 , which can be accounted by the following hamiltonian @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 represent the raising and lowering operators of the qubit , which has the transition frequency @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation and creation operators of the environment modes , having the frequencies @xmath38 , are denoted by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a reservoir with an effective spectral density of the form @xmath41,$ ] where @xmath42 denotes the spectral width of the coupling , and is connected to the correlation time of the reservoir @xmath43 by the relation @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath45 is related to the time scale @xmath46 , over which the state of the system changes , by @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> for such a spectral density , the weak coupling regime , where the dynamics is markovian , corresponds to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ jc ] ) , with the considered spectral density , gives rise to a master equation having the form of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ master ] ) , @xmath49 where the time - dependent decay rate is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the apparatus can be described in the operator - sum representation as @xmath52 , where the corresponding kraus operators @xmath53 are @xmath54 satisfying the condition @xmath55 for all values of @xmath23 , and the parameter @xmath56 reads @xmath57 ^ 2\\label{pt}.\\ ] ]        in the supplementary material , we explain the details of the optimization needed for the evaluation of the non - markovianity measure @xmath58 for the above model . from this point on , we consider the initial state as the optimal state of bipartite system @xmath5 , which is the maximally entangled one .        </S>",
    "<S> we use an optical set - up to demonstrate the application of the entanglement - based measure of non - makovianity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental scheme is sketched in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] . a source of polarization entangled photons </S>",
    "<S> is used to prepare states with purity as high as 90% . </S>",
    "<S> the photon in mode a goes directly to detection after polarization analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the other photon in mode b is sent to two nested interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> the first interferometer , mounted with calcite beam displacers bd1 and bd2 , is responsible for the implementation of the quantum channel over the polarization degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by interpreting the output path 1 and 2 of this interferometer as the environmental degree of freedom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second interferometer , formed by the set bd1 , bd2 and bd3 , coherently combines paths 1 and 2 at bd3 , which is necessary to obtain complete information about the environment .    </S>",
    "<S> we can summarize the experiment in three steps . in the first step </S>",
    "<S> the two - photon polarization - entangled state is prepared in a standard way by pumping two thin non - linear crystals of barium - beta - borate ( bbo ) with a cw pump laser , at 325 nm wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> photon pairs are selected with a 650 nm wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the second step is the implementation of the channel for one of the photons . </S>",
    "<S> this is made with the first interferometer where the polarization modes horizontal ( @xmath59 ) and vertical ( @xmath60 ) are split at the input by bd1 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we can insert half waveplates ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) and control the polarization state in each mode independently . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization modes can be recombined in a second beam displacer ( bd2 ) , giving rise to mode 1 in the same polarization state as the input , if the polarization mode @xmath59 is completely changed into @xmath60 by h1 and if the polarization mode @xmath60 is converted into @xmath59 by h2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the time reversal of the splitting in bd1 .    </S>",
    "<S> when it comes to the second stage of the experiment , in order to implement the amplitude damping channel , we can set h1 so that part of the horizontal component is not converted into vertical . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the remaining horizontal component to leak out to mode 2 of the second part of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> modes 1 and 2 are the two possible states of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> mode 1 carries the recombined polarization state , which can be the same as the input , or can have a reduced population due to the amplitude damping . </S>",
    "<S> if the population is reduced , mode 2 of the environment may be populated .    in the third step , we implement the tomographic measurement in the polarization of both photons and in the path degree of freedom of photon b. in this stage , modes 1 and 2 are directed to the third beam displacer ( bd3 ) , which on the one hand acts as a polarization analyzer . on the other hand , bd3 coherently combines these modes , mapping the path states inside the interferometer onto polarization states outside the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> thus , depending on the settings of h3 and h4 , and quarter - wave plates q3 and q4 , one can have all combinations of projections of the photon state onto some given polarization - path state . </S>",
    "<S> together with the measurements on the other photon , this allows tomography of the 3-qubit state .    here , the density matrices are reconstructed using maximum likelihood estimation , and they are used to compute the correlations between the subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> we prepare a three - qubit state describing the composite system involving the partitions @xmath1 implemented by the polarization of the photon in the upper part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] , @xmath2 implemented by the polarization of the photon going through the channel , and the environment @xmath0 implemented by the paths in the second interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> our set - up produces a unitary interaction on the bipartite system @xmath61 , leaving the system @xmath1 untouched . </S>",
    "<S> this unitary interaction is developed in such a way that , when @xmath0 is traced out , the dynamics of @xmath2 is equivalent to that described by the kraus operators of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kraus ] ) , where @xmath56 is given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the setup realizes our scenario , creating correlations between the individual parts of the tripartite system @xmath6 by implementing an amplitude damping channel on @xmath2 , and lets us perform tomography of @xmath0 , which is crucial for our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we should also note that our environment has no inherent memory and in this sense the experiment emulates the non - markovian features .    </S>",
    "<S> we first produce the following tripartite initial state @xmath62_{\\mathcal{sa}}|0\\rangle_\\mathcal{e}.$ ] as a result of the interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath0 , the state of the bipartite system @xmath5 evolves to @xmath63 with @xmath64 , and the state of the bipartite system @xmath65 evolves to @xmath66|00\\rangle\\langle00|$ ] with @xmath67    we implement two kinds of unitary evolution , which are related to two distinct values of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the unitary operation is applied adjusting @xmath56 in a controlled way , which is not actually a function of time in this experiment , but is controlled by @xmath69 , the angle of half waveplate h2 . in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig]a , we set the unitary evolution ( and consequently the way @xmath69 varies ) to implement a dynamics equivalent to the case of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that , as @xmath4 decays monotonically , @xmath3 increases in the same fashion . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , @xmath71 is positive throughout the whole time evolution , as we can see in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig]a . recall that as long as @xmath71 remains positive , the dynamical map is guaranteed to be divisible , implying a markovian process . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig]b shows the results when we adjust the unitary interaction to implement an evolution equivalent to the case of @xmath72 . in this case , @xmath4 can increase ( decrease ) temporarily while @xmath3 decreases ( increases ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that , when @xmath3 decays , @xmath71 takes negative values , as shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig]b . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the dynamical map in this time interval is nondivisible and the considered quantum process non - markovian .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the experimental results confirm our theoretical predictions that the interaction of the environment @xmath0 with the apparatus @xmath2 can increase the entanglement between the system @xmath1 and the apparatus @xmath2 , paying the cost of a decay in the maximum amount of classical information that the environment @xmath0 can access about the system @xmath1 , and that this feature can be used to signal non - markonianity . as a final remark , </S>",
    "<S> note that we have supposed a pure initial state for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can reach a similar conclusion even if we remove this assumption . in this case , without any loss of generality , we can purify the environment @xmath0 by extending the hilbert space to include an extra subsystem @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the total state @xmath74 is now composed of four partitions , and we have @xmath75 , which indicates that the eof shared by the system @xmath1 and the apparatus @xmath2 is still connected to the ai that the bipartite system of the environment @xmath0 and its purification @xmath73 can acquire about the system @xmath1 .    in conclusion , we have established a direct connection between the rate of change of the entanglement shared by a system @xmath1 and its measurement apparatus @xmath2 , and the rate of change of the maximum amount of classical information that the environment @xmath0 can acquire about the system @xmath1 by interacting with the apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> this connection reveals how the proposed entanglement - based measure of non - markovianity is related to the flow of information between the system @xmath1 and the environment @xmath0 in terms of an entropic measure of information . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have presented an experimental realization of this scenario and shown that the results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed measure of non - markovianity links two apparently unrelated approaches @xcite ; it takes into account the reverse flow of information from the environment back to the system as the measure in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and it also provides a connection with the concept of entanglement as the measure introduced in ref . </S>",
