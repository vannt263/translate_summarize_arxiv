    "non - degenerate means that the form induces an injective adjoint map @xmath11 .",
    "the lattice @xmath5 also carries a linear representation of an appropriately extended mapping class group of @xmath4 ; moreover , this representation preserves the hermitian form on @xmath5 .",
    "the integral lattices @xmath5 have a natural definition in terms of the vector - valued quantum @xmath0-invariants for @xmath1-manifolds with boundary ( see below ) .",
    "their existence thus reflects interesting structural properties of quantum invariants and tqft s .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to give an explicit description of these lattices for surfaces of arbitrary genus , possibly disconnected , by describing bases for them .    here , we allow surfaces to be equipped with a ( possibly empty ) collection of colored banded points ( a banded point is an embedded oriented arc ) , where a color is an integer @xmath12 .",
    "but we require the sum of colors on the colored points of any component of a surface to be even ( this is a feature of the @xmath0-theory we consider ) . before",
    ", explicit bases of @xmath5 were known only in the case where the surface @xmath4 is connected and has genus one or two with no colored points @xcite .",
    "the bases we find display some nice `` graph - like '' structure which we believe should generalize to other tqft s , at least for those associated to integral modular categories as defined in @xcite .",
    "one can ask whether the graph - like bases we have found might be related to canonical bases in representation theory .",
    "an interesting new feature is that the usual tensor product axiom of tqft holds only with some modification for the lattices @xmath5 : it turns out that the lattice associated to a disjoint union of surfaces is sometimes bigger than the tensor product of the lattices associated to the individual components , although this phenomenon does not happen for surfaces without colored points .",
    "we remark that kerler @xcite has announced an integral version of the @xmath0 tqft at @xmath13 , but details have not yet appeared .",
    "chen and le have recently constructed integral tqfts from quantum groups @xcite , although without describing explicit bases for the modules associated to surfaces .",
    "we give two topological applications of our theory . in section [ sec.cut ] ,",
    "we prove a conjecture which relates the cut number of a @xmath1-manifold @xmath14 to divisibility properties of its quantum invariants .",
    "the cut number is the same as the co - rank of @xmath15 .",
    "thus this result relates quantum invariants to the fundamental group of a @xmath1-manifold .",
    "our second application concerns the frohman and kania - bartoszynska ideal of @xmath1-manifolds with boundary @xcite which can be used to show that one @xmath1-manifold does not embed in another .",
    "this ideal is hard to compute directly from its definition , except in very special circumstances , as its definition involves the quantum invariants of infinitely many @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "however our integral bases allow us to give an explicit finite set of generators for this ideal ( see section [ sec.fkb ] ) .",
    "we apply this method to exhibit a family of examples of @xmath1-manifolds with the homology of a solid torus which can not embed in @xmath16    the integral tqft - functor @xmath3 is a refinement of the @xmath0-tqft - functor @xmath17 constructed in @xcite , which in turn is , in some sense , an alternative version of a special case of the reshetikhin - turaev theory @xcite of quantum invariants of @xmath1-manifolds . in particular , the lattice @xmath5 is defined in @xcite as an @xmath9-submodule of the tqft - vector space @xmath18 .",
    "the latter is defined over the quotient field of @xmath9 and exists also when @xmath2 is not prime .",
    "in fact , @xmath18 can be defined ( and is a free module ) already over the ring @xmath19 $ ] , see @xcite , and this is the version of @xmath17 that we refer to in the rest of the paper .    as a submodule of @xmath18 ,",
    "the lattice @xmath5 is simply defined as the @xmath9-span of the vectors associated to @xmath1-manifolds @xmath14 with boundary @xmath20 , with the condition that @xmath14 should have no closed components .",
    "it is clear from this definition that the extended mapping class group acts on @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that @xmath5 is a free lattice of rank equal to the dimension of @xmath18 is shown in @xcite .",
    "the hermitian form @xmath10 is obtained by rescaling the natural form on @xmath18 given by gluing manifolds together along their boundary and computing the invariant of the closed manifold so obtained . that such a rescaling is possible depends crucially on the integrality result for this invariant of closed @xmath1-manifolds due to h.  murakami @xcite and masbaum - roberts @xcite ( see @xcite for more details).-invariant for all @xmath1-manifolds and any odd @xmath2 was proven in 2006 by beliakova - le @xcite ( see also le @xcite ) . ]    bases of the free @xmath19$]-module @xmath18 are well understood in terms of admissible colorings of uni - trivalent graphs . here , any uni - trivalent graph which is the spine of a handlebody with boundary @xmath4 , and with the univalent vertices meeting @xmath4 in the colored points , may be used .",
    "the @xmath9-span of such a _ graph basis _ is a sublattice of @xmath5 , but this sublattice is almost never invariant under the mapping class group , and hence can not be equal to the whole integral lattice @xmath5 .",
    "one might hope that a basis of @xmath5 could be obtained by rescaling the elements of a graph basis in some way , but this is not the case .",
    "still , the situation is actually rather nice . we will show that the lattice @xmath5 admits what we call _ graph - like _ bases associated to a special kind of uni - trivalent graph which we call a _",
    "lollipop tree_. roughly speaking , a graph - like basis is obtained from the usual graph basis associated to the lollipop tree by taking certain linear combinations , followed by some overall rescaling depending on the colors .",
    "the nice thing is that the linear combinations are taken independently in each handle . for precise definitions and a statement of the result in the case of connected surfaces ,",
    "see section  [ sec.thm ] .",
    "we remark here that for connected surfaces , @xmath5 has a simple skein - theoretical description shown in @xcite , namely as the @xmath9-span in @xmath18 of banded links and graphs in a handlebody colored in a certain way . this description will be given below in proposition [ vgraph ] .",
    "for the purpose of the present paper , this description can be taken as the definition of @xmath5 . moreover",
    ", our method of constructing a basis will give an independent proof that @xmath5 is indeed a free lattice .",
    "for disconnected surfaces , we describe a basis of @xmath5 in section [ discon.sec ] , where we also discuss the modified tensor product axiom .    in the case of surfaces of genus one and two without colored points ,",
    "the natural hermitian form @xmath10 was shown in @xcite to be unimodular ( here , unimodular means that the adjoint map is not only injective but is an isomorphism ) .",
    "as already observed there , this property no longer holds in higher genus .",
    "it is then natural to consider the dual lattice @xmath21 , defined as @xmath22 note that @xmath23 , with equality if and only if the form is unimodular .",
    "is a free lattice , so is @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , @xmath21 is isomorphic as an @xmath9-module to the dual of the conjugate of @xmath5 , justifying the terminology . ]",
    "the main result about the dual lattices @xmath24 is that they also admit graph - like bases .",
    "in fact , such bases can be described as rescalings of graph - like bases for @xmath5 ( see again section  [ sec.thm ] for a precise statement ) . moreover , the dual lattices play an important role in the proof that our bases are indeed bases , as the proof proceeds by studying the two lattices simultaneously .",
    "the dual lattice @xmath21 is , of course , also preserved by the action of the mapping class group .",
    "note that when one expresses the mapping class group representation on @xmath25 or on @xmath21 in our integral bases , all matrix coefficients will be algebraic integers .",
    "one also obtains a representation by isometries ( of the associated torsion `` linking form '' ) on the quotient @xmath26 , which admits a simple description , at least if @xmath27 : when @xmath4 is connected and has no colored points , @xmath26 is a skew - symmetric inner product space over the finite field @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 , a similar statement holds with a little more effort for a refined theory , see section  [ torsion.sec ] for details .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that here we merely begin the study of these representations of mapping class groups on torsion modules ; we hope to return to this matter elsewhere .    _ acknowledgments .",
