    "the starvation probability of a buffer is an important performance measure for protocol design of telecommunication networks , as well as in storage systems and ecological systems ( e.g. dams ) .",
    "starvation is said to occur when the buffer is empty .",
    "various applications use buffering in order to control the rate at which packets are served at the destination .",
    "as long as there are packets in the buffer , packets arrive at the destination regularly , i.e. they are spaced by the service time of the buffer .",
    "once the buffer empties packets may arrive at the destination separated by larger times , as the spacing between packets now depends also on the inter - arrival times at the queue .",
    "starvation is in particular undesirable in real time voice as well as in video streaming applications .",
    "the time till starvation of a queue is related to the busy period which has been well studied under the assumption of a stationary arrival process ( see @xcite and their references ) .",
    "in contrast to this assumption , we consider a finite number of arrivals as we are interested in statistics of starvation when a file of fixed size is transferred .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to find the _ distribution of the number of starvations _ within a file of @xmath0 packets .",
    "we first model the buffer as an m / m/1 queue , and then extend it to incorporate the bursty packet arrival that is modeled by an _ interrupted poisson process ( ipp)_. in this system , a fixed amount of packets are _ prefetched _ ( also called `` prefetching threshold '' ) before the service begins or resumes after a starvation event .    in this paper , we propose two approaches ( that give the same result ) to compute the starvation probabilities and the distribution of the number of starvations for a single file .",
    "the first approach gives an explicit result based on the _ ballot theorem _ @xcite .",
    "the second approach provides a recursive computation algorithm .",
    "both are done in an m / m/1 queue on a _",
    "packet level_. using ballot theorem , we can compute in a simple way the exact distribution of the number of starvations explicitly .",
    "when the file size approaches infinity , we present the asymptotic starvation probability using gaussian ( interchangeable with normal ) approximation as well as an approximation of the riemann integral . as a special case that the playout buffer is modeled as an m / d/1 queue , the probability of meeting a certain number of starvations can be obtained on the basis of a discrete version of ballot theorem . whereas the ballot theorem provides an explicit solution , we propose an alternative approach which constitutes a recursive algorithm for computing starvation probabilities .",
    "although the recursive approach does not generate an explicit solution , it does perform better than the ballot theorem in terms of complexity under certain circumstances .",
    "in addition , the recursive approach enables us to compute the probability of starvations with on / off bursty packet arrivals .",
    "we further propose a fluid analysis of starvation behavior on the file level .",
    "this approach , instead of looking into the stochastic packet arrivals and departures , predicts the starvation where the servers manage a large quantity of file transfers .",
    "given the traffic intensity and the distribution of file size , we are able to compute the starvation probability as a function of the prefetching threshold .",
    "the fluid analysis , though simple , offers an important insight on how to control the probability of starvation for many files , instead of for one particular file .",
    "the probabilities of starvations developed in this work have various applications in the different fields .",
    "a prominent example is the media streaming service .",
    "this application demonstrates a dilemma between the prefetching process and the starvation .",
    "a longer prefetching process causes a larger start - up delay , while a shorter one might result in starvations .",
    "the user perceived media quality ( or qoe equivalently ) is impaired by either the large start - up delay or the undesirable starvations .",
    "this problem becomes increasingly important in the epoch that web video hogs up to more than 37% of total traffic during peak hours in usa @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the rapid growth of traffic load , the bandwidth provision usually lags behind . in this context ,",
    "media providers and network operators face a crucial challenge of maintaining a satisfactory qoe of streaming service . with the results developed in this work ,",
    "we are able to answer the fundamental question : _ how many packets should the media player prefetch to optimize the users quality of experience ? _ we propose a set of qoe metrics for both the finite and the infinite file size .",
    "the optimal qoe is achieved by configuring the start - up threshold in packets .",
    "recently , the similar qoe issue is studied in the important works @xcite .",
    "liang et al . @xcite studies the bounds of start - up delay , given the _ deterministic _ playout and arrival curves",
    ". authors in @xcite present a minimum prefetching threshold for an m / d/1 queue , other than an exact solution .",
    "they further extend their method to consider the arrival process depicted by a two - state markov chain .",
    "luan et al .",
    "@xcite adopts diffusion approximation to investigate the time - dependent starvation behavior .",
    "their technique is inadequate to provide insights on starvation in a media file with small number of units ( in packets or chunks ) .",
    "compared to state of the art , our approaches target at the exact solution , and can analyze the starvation of small files .",
    "this is particularly important in the evaluation of adaptive streaming where the entire media file is subdivided into many chunks encoded by multiple playback rates .",
    "the starvation is more likely to happen when the packets from one or several high - definition video chunks are being played .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "solve the distribution of the buffer size as a function of time for the m / m/1 queue .",
    "the exact result is expressed as an infinite sum of modified bessel functions .",
    "the starvation analysis of this work is different from the transient queueing analysis in two aspects .",
    "first , the former aims to find the probability generating function of starvation events while not the queue size .",
    "second , the former does not assume a stationary arrival process .    ballot theorem and recursive equations have been used to analyze the packet loss probability in a finite buffer when the forward error - correcting technique is deployed .",

    "our paper differs from state of the art works in the following ways : i ) we present new theories that yield an _ exact _ probability of starvation , and the probability generating function of starvation events ; ii ) we study of asymptotic behavior with error analysis ; iii ) we perform a macroscopic starvation analysis using a fluid model ; iv ) we configure optimal prefetching thresholds to optimize the qoe metrics .",
    "in this section , we study the starvation behavior of an m / m/1 queue with finite number of arrivals . the analytical method is based on the powerful ballot theorem .",
    "we consider a single media file with finite size @xmath0 .",
    "the media content is pre - stored in the media server . when a user makes a request , the server segments this media into packets , and transfers them to the user by use of tcp or udp protocols . when packets traverse the wired or wireless links , their arrivals to the media player of a user are not deterministic due to the dynamics of the available bandwidth .",
    "the poisson assumption is not the most realistic way to describe packet arrivals , but it reveals the essential features of the system , and is the first step for more general arrival processes . after the streaming packets are received , they are first stored in the playout buffer .",
    "the interval between two packets that are served is assumed to be exponentially distributed so that we can model the receiver buffer as an m / m/1 queue .",
    "the maximum buffer size is assumed to be large enough so that the whole file can be stored .",
    "this simplification is justified by the fact that the storage space is usually very large in the receiver side ( e.g. several gb ) .",
    "the user perceived media quality has two measures called _ start - up delay _ and _ starvation_. as explained earlier , the media player wants to avoid the starvation by prefetching packets .",
