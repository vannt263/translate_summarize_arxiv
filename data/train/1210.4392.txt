    "observations from galactic to cosmological scales leave little room to explanations for dark matter ( dm ) other than that it is provided by a new type of particle .",
    "the most studied option for this particle is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "the reason for this is sometime referred to as the `` wimp miracle '' : for a particle of mass of the weak scale ( @xmath0100 gev ) , the annihilation cross section is given approximately by : @xmath1 and at the same time @xmath2 , from considering the relic density of a stable particle produced thermally in the early universe .",
    "wimps are searched for in a variety of ways : by particle production at accelerators , by searching for signals of nuclear recoils ( direct detection ) and last but not least by searching for a signal from secondary products of wimp annihilation or decay , in particular gamma - rays .",
    "+ spectral signatures in gamma - rays can be classified in smoking gun signals and ambiguous signals .",
    "the smoking gun signals are mainly strong spectral features , such as bumps from virtual internal brems - strahlung @xcite or lines from loop processes , e.g. @xcite @xcite , ambiguous signals are due to continuum emission from pion decay , e.g. @xcite or hard power - laws ( e.g. from final state radiation , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ often constraints in the annihilation cross - section , mass plane of wimps are presented under simplifying assumptions on the final state .",
    "specifically , annihilation into quarks is presented together with annihilation into leptons .",
    "annihilation into quarks yields spectral shapes which are relatively independent of flavor ( e.g. @xcite ) , which is why constraints assuming say  100 % branching fraction into @xmath3 can be taken to be representative for a large class of models . a more accurate approach is provided by considering underlying models providing the wimp , e.g. supersymmetry , as is done in in a fit combining several observables in e.g. @xcite@xcite or considering a large set of individual models , e.g. @xcite .",
    "constraints presented here are for predominant annihilation into quarks . + gamma - rays are detected in space by pair conversion telescopes , such as the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat)@xcite and on ground by imaging air cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) , such as hess @xcite , veritas @xcite and magic @xcite , and water cherenkov telescopes , such as milagro @xcite .",
    "most relevant for searches of dark matter are the fermi - lat and iacts , which are complementary in energy coverage .",
    "fermi - lat is mostly sensitive below @xmath4(100 gev ) and is a survey instrument with large field of view ( @xmath0 2.4 sr ) , but with modest effective area ( @xmath5m@xmath6 ) .",
    "iacts are pointing instruments are sensitive mostly to energies above @xmath4(100 gev ) , they have a small field of view ( @xmath0 0.003 sr ) , but effective areas of @xmath7m@xmath6 .",
    "the number of photons created by dm particle annihilation is proportional to the square of the dm density along the line of sight .",
    "n - body simulations show that our visible galaxy is embedded in a much larger roughly spherical halo , which however shows a lot of substructure , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the density is largest at the center of the halo , which is why the galactic centre should provide the largest signal from dm annihilation .",
    "substructure reveals itself by close - by dwarf galaxies , but n - body simulations usually predict more abundant substructure than observed by `` barionic condensates '' , i.e. the existence of dark matter - only satellites is conjectured .",
    "in addition , integrating over density enhancements may yield a galactic diffuse contribution .",
    "the most interesting extragalactic source - type is galaxy clusters , that might yield a signal due to strong substructure enhancement , e.g. @xcite .",
    "diffuse extragalactic emission , originating from integration over all dm halos throughout the universe is another viable channel .",
    "table [ tab : targets ] summarizes the targets .",
    "+ while consideration of dm structure provides guidance regarding possible targets for searches , the remaining ignorance about the density distribution constitutes the most important uncertainty in constraining the particle properties of dm .",
    "the impact of this ignorance depends on the target : for dwarf galaxies relatively robust density profile estimates can be obtained based on measured stellar motions , whose uncertainties affect constraints by factors of a few @xcite or somewhat less for the combined source analysis @xcite . for",
    "the galactic halo and galaxy clusters uncertainties can be several orders of magnitude , inferred mainly from n - body simulations with relatively weak or indirect experimental constraints .",
    "if the very inner part of the galaxy is excluded from the analysis , these uncertainties are somewhat reduced ( factors of a few , see e.g. @xcite ) . + the present status of the most relevant constraints is summarized in figure [ fig : status ] .",
    "note however that none of them ( except the ( fermi - lat combined dwarf analysis , see below ) includes the uncertainties in the dark matter density .",
    ".usual targets for searches for particle dark matter - and some comments .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , < \" , ]      about 20 dwarf spheroidal galaxies , satellites of our own galaxy have been targeted by the main gamma - ray experiments .",
    "fermi - lat presented observations of 14 dwarf galaxies with dm constraints for about 2/3 of them based on availability of reasonable estimates of the dm distribution based on stellar data ( see figure [ fig : status ] ) @xcite .",
    "h.e.s.s presented constraints from the sagittarius dwarf @xcite and canis major @xcite and sculptor and carina @xcite , magic for willman i and draco @xcite @xcite and segue i @xcite .",
    "veritas for bootes i , draco , ursa minor and willman i @xcite and a  using a deep ( @xmath0 50h ) exposure for segue i @xcite .",
    "the typical exposure of the dwarfs for the ground - based experiments is at about 10 - 20 hours , which can be compared to an equivalent 1000 hours ( 11 month of survey mode ) of fermi , which therefore provides comparable constraints even at 1 tev assumed particle mass .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that in the region above 1 tev the iact will be more sensitive than the fermi - lat , thus truly complementary to fermi - lat .",
    "constraints derived from single dwarf analyses are about one order of magnitude larger than the interesting cosmological bench mark @xmath8 .",
    "it is also noteworthy , that it has recently been claimed that the h.e.s.s .",
    "constraint might be over - optimistic by almost one order of magnitude @xcite , due to updated and more accurate estimates of its dm density . +",
    "a particular interesting analysis approach is the stacking of dwarf galaxies , which due to the universality of the dm spectrum in dwarf galaxies , can be performed as a combined likelihood ( `` likelihood stacking '' ) analysis @xcite .",
    "not only is the statistical power increased , but also the impact of individual uncertainties in dark matter density , is reduced .",
    "this approach resulted in the strictest limits on annihilation cross - section , yet arguably most robust , excluding the canonical cosmological cross - section up to masses of about 30 gev . as mentioned previously , the analysis presented in @xcite constitutes a step forward in one other aspect :",
    "the uncertainties in the dm density have been included in the derivation of the constraints in a statistically well established fashion ( `` profile likelihood '' ) .",
    "the galactic centre ( gc ) is expected to be one of the strongest sources for gamma - ray radiation due to dm annihilation . at the same time , the gc is crowded with conventional gamma - ray sources : hess and fermi - lat sources at the gc are consistent with each other and known sources @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "has used the spectrum of the gc sources ( which is inconsistent with being dominantly due to dm ) , to constrain dm models @xcite , which allows constraining models with extreme properties ( for example those having a large contribution from virtual internal bremsstrahlung ) and under assumptions of very cuspy profiles .",
    "+ the more promising approach is to exclude the very center from the analysis .",
    "however , for gev energies the modeling of the diffuse emission in the inner galaxy poses a challenge , which is why fermi - lat has not presented dark matter constraints for the inner galaxy yet . for galactic diffuse emission excluding the inner 15@xmath9 @xmath10 15@xmath9 ,",
    "an analysis attempting to quantitatively take into account the uncertainties in the cosmic ray induced galactic diffuse emission obtaining competitive constraints has been presented in @xcite . + at iact energies the systematics of the diffuse emission become less important .",
    "the analysis presented in @xcite applies an on - off technique , where ( as usual in iacts ) the background is determined by off - source observations . in this particular case ,",
    "the off source region is defined within the field of view , at distances greater @xmath11 kpc from the galatctic center .",
    "the signal region excludes the very center , i.e. distances smaller than @xmath0 0.05 kpc .",
    "this excludes not only the strong galactic centre sources , but also makes the constrain relatively insensitive ( within a factor 2 ) to the assumptions on dm profile .",
    "the background estimate ( except for instrumental systematics ) is sensitive to gradients in galactic diffuse emission predictions only , which should be negligible at these energies . as the gc is observed for almost 100 hours , and the expected signal is expected to be comparably large , the obtained constraints obtained are up to one order of magnitude better than for dwarfs , and the observation of the gc halo seems to be the most promising venue for iact for the moment",
    ". +          the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) will be the next generation imaging air cherenkov telescope @xcite .",
    "cta will cover over 3 decades in energy , from a few tens of gev up to several tens of tev .",
    "the energy resolution and pointing resolution will be improved by a factor 2 to 3 .",
    "the field of view will be up to 10 degrees ( as compared to about 5 degrees for present day instruments ) .",
    "a comprehensive study of ctas capabilities with respect to fundamental physics has been presented in @xcite . as is the case for present day experiments",
    ", the most sensitive target will be galactic center halo .",
    "the forecast is that the thermal wimp cross - section will be constrained from @xmath0 200 gev up to several tev , see figure [ fig : cta_forecast ] .",
    "dark matter lines have been suggested as a smoking gun signal for dm roughly 15 years ago @xcite .",
    "constraints on line emission have been presented using egret @xcite data , fermi - lat @xcite@xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "data @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , very recently , the claim of an indication of line emission in fermi - lat data @xcite @xcite has drawn considerable attention also at this conference @xcite @xcite . using an analysis technique similar to @xcite , but doubling the amount of data as well as optimizing the region of interest for signal over square - root of background",
    ", @xcite found a ( trial corrected ) 3.2 @xmath12 significant excess at a mass of @xmath0 130 gev that , if interpreted as a signal would amount to a cross - section of about @xmath13 .",
    "the signal is concentrated on the galactic centre with a spatial distribution consistent with an einasto profile @xcite .",
    "this is marginally compatible with the upper limit presented in @xcite .",
    "the result was later confirmed by @xcite , who even claimed a ( trial corrected ) 5@xmath12 detection significance .",
    "+ the main challenge to this claim is the fact that the gamma - ray signal from the earth s limb shows an excess of similar significance at the same energy , see e.g. weniger ( this conference ) .",
    "this effect appears after an appropriate zenith cut is applied that takes account for the fact that the fermi - lat is usually not head - on exposed to the earth limb .",
    "gamma - rays in the earth limb are caused by cosmic - ray interaction in the earth atmosphere and their spectrum is featureless .",
    "the sample therefore constitutes a useful control sample for ( not only ) spectral feature searches .",
    "the community is now impatiently waiting for a verdict from the fermi - lat collaboration .",
    "the main problem at this point is the limited statistics in both the gc and limb sample .",
    "the fermi - lat has scheduled increase in statistics for the limb sample , by weekly 3 hour long earth limb observations .",
    "+ should an instrumental origin of the signal be ruled out ( or results are inconclusive ) , fermi - lat could alter its observation mode to increase exposure to the galactic centre @xcite , on the other hand independent confirmation will be necessary .",
    "both the operational hess  ii iact and the future satellite mission gamma-400 @xcite seem to be sensitive enough to provide confirmation @xcite .      for indirect detection ,",
    "constraining annihilation cross - section , gamma - rays are the most attractive probe , providing targets with high signal flux expectation and relatively well constrained astrophysical uncertainties .",
    "as this conference is about gamma - rays , the detailed discussion of results of direct searches and accelerator searches ( as well as other indirect probes ) is out of scope .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out the complementarity of the different probes once again .",
    "this complementarity is ultimately model - dependent , but at least for one of the most attractive candidates for a wimp theory ( supersymmetry ) it is apparent . in figure",
    "[ fig : complementarity1 ] , taken from @xcite , it is obvious that there is little correlation between scattering cross section and annihilation cross - section in phenomenological minimal supersymmetry : direct detection and neutrinos from the sun constrain the model space approximately orthogonal to indirect detection by gamma - rays .",
    "+        another example concerns collider searches for particles beyond the standard model .",
    "collider detection and subsequent measurements of the sparticle mass spectrum and splitings of a supersymmetric model providing dark matter might be used to calculate annihilation cross - sections and relic density @xcite . in the framework of phenomenological minimal supersymmetry ,",
    "however , it is quite conceivable that only after a combination with indirect detection experiments the solution providing dm can be identified @xcite .",
    "since the launch of the fermi - lat indirect detection of dark matter with gamma - rays has reached sensitivities that allow to probe the most interesting parameter space of the wimp paradigm .",
    "the crucial target here are dwarf spheroidal galaxies that are analysed in a combined fashion .",
    "this gain in sensitivity is naturally accompanied by a number of detection claims or indications , the most recent being a line feature at a wimp mass of @xmath0 130 gev at the galactic centre . in the near future ,",
    "ut is now up to the fermi - lat instrument team , as well as possible hess ( within a timescale of about 1 - 2 years ) to confirm or refute this claim .",
    "+ iacts have gained ground .",
    "the constraints obtained from observations of the galactic centre halo constitute a large step forward in terms of constraining wimp parameter space above masses of about a tev .",
    "predictions for cta , employing a galactic center halo analysis , together with forecasts on the fermi - lat constraints obtainable after 10 years arrive at the exciting possibility that the cosmological benchmark cross - section could be probed from masses of a few gev to about 10 tev .",
    "+ as the popularity of the wimp as dark matter candidate rests in large part on the `` wimp miracle '' , it is fair to claim that a non detection in the coming 10 years will imply a serious challenge to the paradigm . or to put it more optimistically : a discovery within the next 10 years is certainly in the cards .",
