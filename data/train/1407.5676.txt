    "the eccentricity of the disk is approximately constant with radius at @xmath33 . during and after the giant outburst",
    ", the eccentricity decays .",
    "there are several mechanisms that may drive eccentricity in a circumprimary disk that we discuss here .",
    "first , eccentricity may be directly excited due to the eccentric companion .",
    "a perturber on an eccentric orbit forces an eccentricity on an initially circular particle orbit .",
    "the particle eccentricity grows nearly linearly in time ( see section iii.c of @xcite ) .",
    "we have performed test particle simulations of a coplanar eccentric binary system including the eccentric forcing of the companion ( see equation  ( 9 ) in * ? ? ?",
    ". the initially constant rate of eccentricity growth of the particle increases strongly with distance from the be star , @xmath34 , as @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 ) . for example",
    ", a particle with an initial distance of @xmath37 , the eccentricity grows linearly at a rate of @xmath38 per binary orbit .",
    "thus , the disk becomes eccentric on a timescale of around 10 orbital periods .",
    "the eccentricity of the particle orbit grows perpendicularly to the eccentricity of the binary orbit .",
    "this is observed in our simulations and thus we suggest that gravitational forcing from the companion is the most likely mechanism for eccentricity growth here . hence , the disk must expand radially in order for eccentricity to be driven .",
    "we will investigate this process in the inclined disk in more detail in a future publication .    secondly , instability at the 3:1 lindblad resonance can lead to eccentricity growth even in an initially circular disk @xcite .",
    "the radius of the 3:1 resonance is @xmath39 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which for our typical parameters is @xmath40 .",
    "finally , it could be possible for eccentricity to be driven by the stream from the outside of the be star disk falling back towards and hitting the be star disk @xcite .",
    "however , there is only a small amount of material involved in the streams . in the coplanar case",
    ", the tidal truncation radius of the disk may be estimated by the radius at which ballistic particle orbits cross . in a circular binary with our parameters this would be at a radius of @xmath41 @xcite . for our parameters",
    "this is @xmath42 . in an eccentric binary ,",
    "the size of the disk is further reduced . for our parameters ,",
    "the truncation radius is around @xmath43 @xcite . in an eccentric binary ,",
    "the disk eccentricity ( with no dissipation ) grows at all radii but the rate is strongly dependent on radius .",
    "thus large eccentricity growth is limited to high inclination disks where reduced tidal torques allow the disk to expand to large radii ( nixon et al . in prep ) . for smaller disks ( lower inclinations ) ,",
    "dissipation can keep the disk close to circular with @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we have run several sph simulations with varying misalignment angle and we find that the disk becomes significantly eccentric only for @xmath45 .",
    "thus , type  ii outbursts are expected only in systems with a large misalignment angle .",
    "here we consider properties of the accretion disk that forms around the neutron star . due to the misalignment between the be star disk and the neutron star orbit it is likely that accretion on to the neutron star proceeds through an initially misaligned disk ( c.f .",
    "* ) . for numerical tractability we can not model the neutron star disk in its entirety and it remains under - resolved even during the peak of the type  ii outburst",
    ". this will be investigated in more detail in a future publication .",
    "however , we have run several sph simulations with a much smaller neutron star accretion radius .",
    "we do not find significant evidence for a neutron star accretion disk during the type  i activity , only during the type  ii .",
    "there is much less material and its circularization radius is much smaller during the type  i outburst phase and thus it accretes more rapidly ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the viscous timescale in the neutron star disk is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the distance from the neutron star , the viscosity is @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the @xcite parameter and the sound speed is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the gas constant and @xmath52 is the gas mean molecular weight .",
    "the temperature of the disk surface is found by assuming a steady profile @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "thus , the accretion timescale of the disk scaled by the orbital period is @xmath54 if the disc is significantly optically thick this is an overestimate .",
    "while a radially extended neutron star disk is present , the accretion on to the neutron star is smoothed on a timescale of several orbital periods .",
    "this explains why there is no orbital modulation observed during a type  ii x - ray outburst .",
    "we do not expect smoothing on this timescale to take place during the type  i activity because the accreting material has lower initial angular momentum and therefore a smaller circularisation radius ( @xmath55 ) and viscous time .",
    "these numbers are approximate and tend to over - predict the viscous time compared to observations as we assume a steady disk .",
    "time dependent processes , such as tides or interactions of the neutron star disk with streams from the be star disk could shorten the viscous timescale .",
    "the corresponding x - ray luminosity of the disk is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the radius of the neutron star and thus @xmath58 thus , for the accretion rates to agree with observations of the x - ray luminosities , we require an initial disk mass of around @xmath59 or smaller .",
    "this agrees well with the be star mass loss rates that are in the range @xmath60 to @xmath61 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lifetimes of the be star disks ( of a few years ) .",
    "the simulations presented here model a warped , eccentric , precessing be star disk . the ejection mechanism for material from the be star to the disk is poorly understood and thus we have considered only the evolution following disk formation .",
    "thus , the disc is an accretion rather than a decretion disc , but over the timescales we simulate this should not affect our conclusions .",
    "the ejection of material from the be star surface in a circular orbit at the inner edge of the disc could affect the eccentricity growth and inclination of the disc .",
    "however , because eccentricity growth is driven more strongly in the outer parts of the disc , this should not affect the type  ii outburst mechanism .    during the type  ii outburst in our simulation ,",
    "the be star disk becomes significantly depleted .",
    "about @xmath62 of the initial disk mass is accreted on to the be star .",
    "this depletion could explain the cycles observed in the optical light curves of be / x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". with mass ejection from the be star included , the disk would build up again and we would expect the type  ii outbursts to recur .",
    "the timescale of recurrence would depend on the accretion rate on to the be star disk .",
    "parameters such as the eccentricity , misalignment and binary separation could be varied to model other be / x - ray binary systems and predict the types of outbursts that may occur .",
    "observations suggest that the type  ii outbursts occur when the disk becomes warped .",
    "however we have found that this is not a sufficient condition , it is necessary for the disk to become eccentric",
    ". an inclined circular disk , which can expand freely as the tidal torques are smaller , becomes eccentric before it becomes large enough for a ns encounter .",
    "if there are no outbursts observed in a be binary system , the binary must have small eccentricity and misalignment .",
    "conversely , if type  ii outbursts are observed , then the system must be highly misaligned .",
    "we find that eccentricity may also be driven in counter rotating discs .",
    "the frequency of outbursts in be / x - ray binary systems will be investigated in future with a disc model including mass injection into the disc from the be  star in order to determine critical inclination angles required for outbursts .",
    "the tidal torque aligns the disk with the binary orbital plane on a timescale of years @xcite . in a long term disk simulation",
    "this alignment may also play a role in ending the outburst cycle .",
    "we have performed 3d sph simulations of a moderately eccentric and highly misaligned be / x - ray binary .",
    "we find that for a binary with orbital period of @xmath63 and eccentricity @xmath64 that type i outbursts occur for all misalignments , including the aligned case .",
    "if the disk is sufficiently misaligned , @xmath45 , the disk is much larger because the tidal torque is weaker .",
    "this allows strong eccentricity growth in the outer parts of the disk from the gravitational forcing of the eccentric companion .",
    "thus , the disk becomes eccentric on a timescale of around ten binary orbital periods .",
    "we suggest that the eccentric disk causes a type  ii x - ray outburst as a large amount of material is transferred to the neutron star .",
