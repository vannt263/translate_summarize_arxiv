    "the insurer of an insurance contract needs to ensure that the premium contains a necessary conservative margin  the so called risk loading or safety loading  to put up the risk capital .",
    "when determining this margin in a multi - period insurance contract , the insurer faces two types of risks to evaluate .",
    "the first one comes from unfavorable fluctuations in the level of investment funded by accumulated premiums .",
    "the second risk comes from the uncertainty of ( life ) time , i.e. , the risk of the unfavorable event occurring at an inopportune time , e.g. , before the funding target is reached .",
    "it is desirable to determine the margin that reflects both types of risks adequately .",
    "however , there seems to be no theoretically established solution to this challenging problem .",
    "the main difficulty is in the inseparable nature of the two types of risks themselves ; the insurance contract guarantees a defined payment at an uncertain time of the insured event occurring by uncertain funding .    in this paper , toward a solution to the problem above , we present a fairly general approach to the multi - period pricing problem .",
    "it is a combination of the _ utility indifference pricing _ and _ optimal intertemporal risk allocation_. though both are quite general concepts , their combination leads us to an interesting new premium calculation method in a multi - period setting .",
    "the general setting of the utility indifference pricing is as follows : we define the _ indifference price _",
    "@xmath0 of a risk @xmath1 by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the utility of a risk @xmath4 and the constant @xmath5 is the initial wealth of the seller of @xmath1 .",
    "the price @xmath0 is the so - called _ selling _ indifference price : @xmath0 is the amount that leaves the seller of the risk @xmath1 indifferent between selling and being paid for @xmath1 , and neither selling nor being paid for @xmath1 . in mathematical finance",
    ", the indifference pricing approach is becoming one of the major pricing methods in incomplete markets ( see , e.g. , hodges and neuberger @xcite , rouge and el karoui @xcite , musiela and zariphopoulou @xcite , bielecki et al .",
    "@xcite , and mller and steffensen @xcite ) .",
    "the indifference pricing also fits the pricing of insurance well .",
    "for example , in the single - period pricing , we can show that many known premium principles are obtained by this method .",
    "the expectation , variance and exponential premium principles are among them .",
    "thus , the utility indifference pricing approach has the potential advantage of pricing products in finance and insurance coherently .",
    "we write @xmath6 for the class of admissible intertemporal risk allocations @xmath7 of @xmath4 over the multi - period interval @xmath8 ( see definition [ defn:2.1 ] below ) : @xmath7 is an essentially bounded adapted process satisfying the risk allocation condition @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the discounted value of @xmath11 . in this paper , we adopt the following utility @xmath12 in ( ip ) : @xmath13 :   ( y_t)_{t\\in\\t}\\in\\mathcal{a}(w)\\right\\}. \\tag{u}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is a time - dependent utility function describing the intertemporal preferences of an economic agent such as an insurance company .",
    "this definition says that if an allocation @xmath15 attains the supremum in ( u ) , then the utility of @xmath4 is based on the choice of @xmath16 .",
    "thus , to precisely investigate @xmath12 , whence @xmath17 , we are led to the problem of finding @xmath15 that attains the supremum in ( u ) , which we call the _ optimal intertemporal risk allocation _ of @xmath4 .",
    "the optimal risk allocation problems date back to the classical work of borch @xcite , where pareto optimality in uncertain circumstances is studied extensively , motivated mainly by reinsurance .",
    "since then , various types of optimal risk allocation problems have been considered by bhlmann @xcite , gerber @xcite , bhlmann and jewell @xcite , and many others .",
    "see also gerber and pafumi @xcite , duffie @xcite , dana and jeanblanc @xcite and dana and scarsini @xcite .",
    "recently , many authors consider the problems based on the preferences defined by coherent or convex risk measures introduced by artzner et al .",
    "@xcite , delbaen @xcite , and fllmer and schied @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "see , e.g. , heath and ku @xcite , barrieu and el karoui @xcite , burgert and rschendorf @xcite , acciaio @xcite , and jouini et al .  @xcite .",
    "unlike most of these references where the problems of optimal risk allocation among several economic agents are discussed , we consider a single agent in the multi - period framework who seeks to find the optimal intertemporal allocation of her / his risk .",
    "as the definition itself suggests , this optimality is closely related to pareto optimality .",
    "note , however , that classical pareto optimality is concerned with allocations of risk among economic agents in single - period models , while the pareto optimality we consider in this paper is concerned with intertemporal allocations of the aggregate risk of a single agent in the multi - period setting , whence it may be called _ time _ pareto optimality .",
    "our key finding about the optimal intertemporal risk allocation ( theorem [ thm:2.8 ] ) is that an allocation @xmath15 is optimal if and only if the following first order condition is satisfied : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the underlying information structure .",
    "it is perhaps interesting that this first order condition involves a martingale property . by applying this characterization to the exponential utility",
    ", we can derive an algorithm to compute the optimal intertemporal risk allocation and indifference price @xmath17 for it ( theorem [ thm:3.4 ] ) .",
    "we illustrate the usefulness of this algorithm by applying it to a popular type of multi - period insurance contract , whereby obtaining an essentially new type of premium calculation method in the multi - period setting ( theorem [ thm:4.3 ] ) .",
    "this method is simple and can be easily implemented numerically .",
    "we see that the results of numerical calculations are well coincident with the risk loading level determined by traditional practices .",
    "the results also suggest a possible _ implied utility approach _ to insurance pricing .    in  2 , we give basic results on the optimal intertemporal risk allocation , including its characterization by ( fo ) and its relationship to pareto optimality . in  3",
    ", we apply the results in  2 to the exponential utility function and derive the optimal intertemporal risk allocation and indifference price for it .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the applications of the results in  3 to insurance pricing .",
    "we also discuss properties of the indifference prices and some results of numerical calculations .",
