    "an attractive feature of the colour dipole approach to high - energy interactions @xcite is that it provides a very simple physical interpretation of the physics at small values of the bjorken variable @xmath2 .",
    "as it can also be justified in the framework of perturbative qcd in the leading logarithm approximation @xcite ( following the bfkl approach @xcite ) , it represents an interesting possibility for the description of hard scattering at small @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , even in its simplest version , the colour dipole model turned out to be rather successful in describing the total @xcite and diffractive @xcite virtual photon - nucleon cross - sections .",
    "its generalizations are now commonly used for the parametrization of data from hera and the tevatron @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of the model are the dipole - dipole cross - section and the distribution of dipoles in the projectile and in the target .",
    "it is formulated in transverse ( configuration ) space , taking advantage of the fact that at very high energy the transverse positions of the colliding objects are - to a good approximation - conserved during the collision .",
    "this is , in fact , the origin of the simplicity of the dipole model approach to high - energy scattering .",
    "it appears important to confront these attractive features of the dipole model to the present knowledge on perturbative qcd resummations at leading and next - to - leading level in logarithms of the energy ( i.e. @xmath1 ) . among the basic",
    "known properties of the sum of the corresponding feynman diagrams , the coupling of external sources ( in particular a virtual photon in deep - inelastic reactions ) is based on the theorem of @xmath0 factorization , proven in the leading logarithmic approximation of qcd @xcite .",
    "the theorem states that the `` unintegrated '' gluon distribution , i.e. the distribution of energy _ and _ transverse momentum of gluons in the target , factorizes from the rest of the process .",
    "the remaining factor is the so - called `` impact factor '' .",
    "this impact factor is an universal quantity , the same in all processes initiated by the same external source , e.g. the photon .",
    "the `` unintegrated '' gluon distribution characterizes the target , but again the target impact factor can also be factorized out , leaving place to an universal interaction term , given by the bfkl pomeron in the same leading logarithmic approach @xcite . at next - to - leading level",
    ", the modified interaction term is now known @xcite but the impact factors are not yet determined .",
    "it should be emphasized that , although both colour dipole model and @xmath0 factorization were ( till now ) justified only at the leading logarithm level , in practical applications it is necessary to go beyond this approximation in order to fix the energy scale of the problem . before knowing the exact next - leading approximation , the current extention beyond the leading order is different in the two approaches . in the dipole model",
    "it is necessary to postulate the relation between @xmath2 and the energy available for the dipole cascade to develop . in the @xmath0 factorization approach used in phenomenology",
    "( see e.g.@xcite ) the relation between @xmath2 and gluon longitudinal momentum is fixed by the kinematics of the corresponding feynman diagram . as neither of these methods can be justified without extensive next - to - leading - order calculations , it remains an open question to know either which one describes better the physical reality or how both are to be modified .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the relation between these two approaches .",
    "we start with the @xmath0 factorized expression for the total cross - section ( with longitudinal polarization of the photon , but the results extend to the transverse one in the same way ) assuming either full kinematics or its leading - log contribution . in the last case",
    "we prove the exact equivalence with the dipole model expression as expected , since they are both based on bfkl dynamics . in the former one ,",
    "we show an explicit violation of the conservation of transverse positions of the colliding objects during the collision . taking as an explicit example the diffractive production of two jets , we extend our discussion to the off - diagonal gluon distributions , where similar differences appear when using the full kinematics .",
    "our main conclusion is that , although equivalent at the leading logarithm level , the extensions of the dipole model and those based on @xmath0 factorization to the next - to - leading order lead to results _ which are not compatible with each other_. this conclusion emphasizes the urgent need for the full next order calculation which would settle the question of validity of the two most favoured approaches to the hard collisions at high energy . in particular , the fate of transverse coordinate conservation in high - energy diffractive collisions is to be examined .",
    "this seems important , as some nowadays quite popular models @xcite-@xcite are based on the assumption that this property remains true not only to all orders of the perturbation theory but even extend to the non - perturbative regime .    in the next section",
    "we remind briefly the results of the qcd dipole model for the total ( virtual ) photon cross - section and show in section 3 that they are equivalent to the results obtained using @xmath0 factorization in the leading logarithm approximation .",
    "next , @xmath0 factorization with exact gluon kinematics is discussed . in section 4",
    "it is shown to be incompatible with the qcd dipole model . in section 5",
    "we extend the arguments to inelastic collisions involving the non - diagonal gluon distributions .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "let us first remind briefly for future reference the results obtained in the dipole model for the total cross - section of the virtual photon on an arbitrary target .",
    "the cross - section formula reads ( c.f .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) ( y;q ) = 2 n_c d^2r dz  ( r;y )   |(r , z;q)|^2 e1 where the factor @xmath3 represents summation over spins and colours of the @xmath4 states describing the virtual photon , and ( through the optical theorem ) ( r;y ) = 2 < , z|t(t=0;y)|,z > 2t(r;y ) e2e is the dipole - target cross - section and @xmath5 is the light - cone photon wave function ( our notation is explicit on fig.1 ) .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath6 is a function of only one transverse vector @xmath7 .",
    "this is the consequence of the diagonal character of the interaction ( following from the conservation of the impact parameter in high - energy collisions ) .",
    "we shall exclusively discuss longitudinal cross - sections and thus give below only the formula for the wave function of the longitudinal photon @xcite : _",
    "l(r , z;q ) =  2z(1-z)qk_0(r ) [ 11 ] with @xmath8 .    in case",
    "the target is itself a dipole of transverse size @xmath9 ( one may more generally expand the target wave - function over a basis of such states ) , the cross - section ( [ e1 ] ) is given by @xcite < , z|t(t=0;y;r_0)|,z>=2 _",
    "s^2r_0 ^ 2 e^()y ( ) ^2h ( ) e2 where ( ) = e3 is the well - known bfkl @xcite kernel eigenvalue and h()=14 ^ 2(1-)^2 .",
    "e4 finally , @xmath10 is the rapidity range available for the dipole cascade to develop .",
    "@xmath10 is not uniquely defined in the context of the dipole model , a consequence of its origin in the leading logarithm approximation .",
    "one expects that @xmath10 is of the form y= ( 1x_bj)- y_0 a6 @xmath11 can -at least in principle- depend on all variables ( except @xmath2 ) which are relevant in the process considered . in the case of the total cross - section a successfull phenomenology @xcite gave @xmath12 but additional dependence on other variables , in particular on @xmath13 can also be envisaged @xcite . as emphasized in the introduction , selecting a definite form of @xmath11 can not be justified in the leading logarithm approximation ( on which the dipole model is based ) and thus represents additional assumption which can only be supported by phenomenological arguments .",
    "we shall now recall the results obtained for the total cross - section in the approach using the @xmath0 factorization as the starting point , and show that , when considered in the leading - log approximation , they are equivalent to the dipole model predictions . as mentioned in the introduction , we introduce the `` unintegrated '' gluon distribution which we shall denote by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the target ( nucleon ) momentum fraction carried by the gluon and @xmath16 is the gluon transverse momentum .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the cross - section is evaluated from the diagram shown in fig .",
    "2 . the relevant formulae can be found , e.g. , in @xcite where one reads    _",
    "l= f_l= _ 0 ^ 1 dz[z(1-z)]^2 +   d^2p ( 1 ^ 2+p^2 - 1 ^ 2+(p+k)^2)^2 g(x_g , k^2 ) 16    using twice the identity 1p^2+^2 = 12d^2r e^i k_0(r ) x1 results in the following expression : _",
    "l= 1(2)^2_0 ^ 1 dz[z(1-z)]^2 d^2r k_0(r)d^2r k_0(r ) +  d^2p  e^i(- ) d ( , ) x2 where d(,)= g(x_g , k^2 ) ( 1-e^-i ) ( 1-e^i ) .",
    "x3    the formulae ( [ x2 ] ) and ( [ x3 ] ) provide the key point of our discussion .",
    "the conservation of transverse position throughout the interaction would mean that d^2p   e^i(-)d ( , ) ^2(- )  .",
    "x3 g as this may happen only if @xmath17 does not depend on @xmath18 , it becomes clear from ( [ x3 ] ) that the question of the gluon kinematics , i.e. the determination of @xmath15 as a function of the other variables , is crucial .",
    "indeed , if the gluon kinematics is taken into account , @xmath15 can be expressed by other variables ( see , e.g.@xcite ) : x_g= x_bj   ; = - ( 1-z )  .",
    "y1 consequently , as seen from ( [ x3 ] ) , @xmath17 does depend on @xmath18 . postponing the detailed discussion of this case to the next section , we shall now consider the formula ( [ x3 ] ) in the leading logarithm approximation ( for which the @xmath0 factorization can be exactly proven ) . in this approximation",
    "the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath15 is not well defined because in the limit @xmath19 , the difference between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is finite and thus any contribution depending on this difference ( or -equivalently- on the ratio @xmath22 ) must be of higher order . taking this ambiguity into account",
    "we can treat @xmath15 in ( [ 16 ] ) as a constant , independent of other variables entering the process factorization @xcite . ] . under this condition (",
    "[ 16 ] ) can be transformed into the form given by the dipole model formula discussed in the previous section @xcite .    indeed ,",
    "since @xmath17 does not depend on @xmath18 , the integral over @xmath23 gives @xmath24 and thus we obtain _",
    "_ 0 ^ 1 dz[z(1-z)]^2 d^2r [ k_0(r)]^2 +   g(x_g , k^2 ) ( 1-e^-i )  .",
    "xx2 using ( [ 11 ] ) this can be written in the form of ( [ e1 ] ) with the function @xmath25 now given by @xcite ( r , y)=g(x_g , k^2 ) ( 1-e^i )  .",
    "[ 19 ] this formula expresses the dipole - target forward elastic amplitude in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution in the target .",
    "it can be inverted . to this end",
    "we calculate the moments of @xmath6 . using ( [ 19 ] ) and the identity _ 0^ [ 1-j_0(u ) ] = 22 one obtains ( , y ) 12 d^2r  r^-2 - 2   t(r , y ) = \\ { } ( x_g , ) 22a where ( x_g,)12k^2 g(x_g , k^2 ) = k^-2 + 2 g(x , k^2 ) 22b and the factor between brackets @xmath26 can be interpreted as the gluon - dipole vertex function @xcite .    using the inverse mellin transform and ( [ 22a ] ) ,",
    "we thus obtain g(x_g , k^2)2  k ^2 - 2  ( x_g , ) + =  k ^2 - 2  ( , y ) 22d where @xmath27 is given by ( [ 22a ] ) .",
    "this is a general formula valid for any target .",
    "if the target is itself a qcd dipole , we can use the formula ( [ e2 ] ) for @xmath6 and obtain g(x_g , k^2)= ( 2)^2 - 2 h ( )  e^ ( ) y. 26",
    "although the validity of the @xmath0 factorization was established only at the leading order in @xmath1 , it is natural to treat the diagrams of fig .",
    "2 as giving the correct structure of the process ( to all orders ) .",
    "this is usually the way @xmath0 factorization is applied for the description of high - energy collisions @xcite-@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it should be realized , however , that such an approach takes into account only part of the higher order corrections and thus can not be justified from the first principles without estimating contributions from other diagrams which appear at higher orders .",
    "the important consequence of this procedure is , in particular , that the kinematics of the diagram is to be fully taken into account and thus the value of @xmath15 in eq.([16 ] ) becomes now well - defined and given by ( [ y1 ] ) . as we have already indicated in the previous section , it turns out that these relations break the connection between the formula ( [ 16 ] ) of @xmath0 factorization and ( [ e1 ] ) of the colour dipole model , established in section 3 at the leading logarithm level .",
    "indeed , in this case we have d(,)= g(x_bj , k^2 ) ( 1-e^-i ) ( 1-e^i ) . y3",
    "thus @xmath28 does depend on @xmath18 and , consequently , the integral over @xmath23 in ( [ x3 g ] ) does not give @xmath29 ( except in the particular case when @xmath30 does not depend on @xmath15 at all , corresponding to the energy - independent cross - section ) . to obtain a better insight , we express the gluon distribution in the form of a mellin transform : g(x_g , k^2)= ( x_g)^-n g_n(k^2 ) y4 and find ( see @xcite ) d^2p   e^i(-)d ( , , ) g_n(k^2 ) + k_1-n ( |-| ) ||^1-n   .",
    "y4y    one thus explicitly sees that the process is no longer diagional in transverse size @xmath31 of the dipole .",
    "since the diagonal character of the dipole interaction in the transverse space is the fundamental ingredient of the colour dipole approach , we must conclude that _ the extension of the theorem of @xmath0 factorization @xcite to non - leading order by including the exact gluon kinematics is not compatible with the colour dipole model_. this conclusion seems important , as it emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the standard phenomenology of hard high - energy interactions .",
    "to complete the argument , we shall discuss also inelastic diffraction .",
    "the simplest example for which results were presented in both models is the two jet production off any target .    in the dipole model the cross - section for this process",
    "can be readily obtained taking as a starting point the formula for quasi - elastic diffraction given in @xcite .",
    "the result is =  |g(,z , t;y^*)|^2 a1 where g(p , z , t;y^*)=12 d^2r ( i  .  )",
    "< , z|t(t;y^*)|,z > ( , z;q )  .",
    "a2 here @xmath18 is the transverse momentum of the jet and @xmath32 is the photon wave function given by ( [ 11 ] ) .    in the case when the target is itself a dipole of size @xmath9 , the amplitude @xmath33 was first discussed in @xcite and explicitly calculated in @xcite . here",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the forward scattering @xmath34 @xcite . in this case",
    "the formula for @xmath6 is much simpler and given by ( [ e2 ] ) , up to the determination of @xmath35 .",
    "as already explained , @xmath35 is the rapidity range available for the dipole cascade to develop .",
    "it should be emphasized again that it remains undetermined and , in particular , need not be the same as in ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "the general formula ( [ a6 ] ) remains valid but in the case of the diffractive production a successful phenomenology @xcite required ( see formula ( [ a6 ] ) ) @xmath36 , i.e. y^*= ( ) ; x_p = x_bj/. aa7    we shall now show that , at the leading logarithm approximation , the formula for the diffractive two - jet production obtained with the help the @xmath0 factorization can also be expressed in the form ( [ a1],[a2 ] ) derived from the dipole model .",
    "we also derive an explicit relation between the dipole elastic amplitude and the off - diagonal gluon distribution .",
    "we start from the formula of @xcite , giving the forward ( @xmath37 ) differential cross - section for diffractive production of two jets ( see also @xcite ) = e_q^2 f(x_bj , x,x,k^2 ) f(x_bj , x,x,k^2 ) _",
    "l(z , k , k,p ) [ 1 ] where the function @xmath38 is the linear combination of the off - diagonal @xcite gluon distributions inside a proton f(x_bj , x,x,k^2 ) = 12 \\{g(x+x_p , x,k^2)+g(x+x_p , x,k^2 ) } [ 2 ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the gluon momenta as explained in @xcite and @xmath41 given by ( [ aa7 ] ) .",
    "since the expression for @xmath42 ( given in @xcite ) can be written in the factorized form _",
    "l = 4q^2z^2(1-z)^2 [ 5 ] where @xmath43 , one sees immediately that ( [ 1 ] ) can be cast in the form ( [ a1 ] ) with g= 2qz(1-z)f(x_bj , x,x,k^2 )   .",
    "+ [ 6 ] it remains to be shown that @xmath44 given by ( [ 6 ] ) can be written in the form ( [ a2 ] ) .    to see this ,",
    "we follow closely the argument of section 3 . using the identity ( [ x1 ] )",
    "we write the first term of ( [ 6 ] ) in the form of an integral over @xmath45 : f(x_bj , x,x,k^2 ) 1p^2+^2 = 12d^2r e^i   f(x_bj , x,x,k^2 ) k_0 ( r )  .",
    "8 the same operation can be applied to the second term and thus we obtain g=12 d^2r  e^ipr  t(r , z , x , x_p )  _ l(r , z;q ) [ 10 ] where @xmath46 is given by ( [ 11 ] ) and t(r , z , x , x_p)=_s ( 1- e^i ) f(x_bj , x,x,k^2 )  . [ 12 ] thus we recover a similar formula as in the case of total cross - section ( see section 2 , eq.([19 ] ) ) , except that now the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath47 is replaced by the unintegrated _ off - diagonal _ gluon distribution @xmath38 , as appropriate for inelastic processes @xcite .",
    "one sees that the eq.([12 ] ) is valid even if exact gluon kinematics is included ( at no place in the derivation we needed the assumption that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants , independent of @xmath18 ) .",
    "its physical interpretation , however , depends crucially on this problem . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath39 and @xmath40 do not depend on @xmath18 , also @xmath6 given by ( [ 12 ] ) is @xmath18-independent and _ only in this case it can be interpreted as the amplitude for scattering of the dipole of a given transverse size @xmath31_. if , on the other hand , the exact gluon kinematics is taken into account ( which includes partly contribution of higher orders ) one has @xcite x= x_p;x ",
    "= x_p [ 3 ] and thus @xmath6 is a function of both @xmath31 and @xmath18 .",
    "this of course can not be the case if it is to be interpreted as the scattering amplitude .",
    "thus we conclude that , similarly as in the case of total cross - section , the description of diffractive scattering in the dipole model is only compatible with the @xmath0 factorization if one restricts to the leading logarithm level .",
    "if one stays at the leading logarithm approximation , one can of course repeat the argument of section 3 and thus conclude that the relations between the dipole amplitude and the gluon distribution of section 3 should be valid with the replacement @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "in particular f(x_bj , x,x,k^2)=  k ^2 - 2  ( , y^ * )  .",
    "14a using ( [ e2 ] ) , one can also write down the explicit prediction of the dipole model for the gluon distribution in the dipole target : f(x_bj , x,x,k^2 ) = _ s ( 2)^2 - 2 e^()y^ * h ( ) . 14",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that _ in the leading logarithm approximation _ the @xmath0 factorization and the colour dipole model give equivalent description of hard processes at high energy .",
    "on the other hand , when one steps beyond the leading logarithmic approximation by supplementing the @xmath0 factorization algorithm with the exact kinematics of the corresponding feynman diagrams ( as is the case in practical applications @xcite ) , the result is _ incompatible _ with the colour dipole model : we have shown that such a procedure leads to a violation of the conservation of transverse positions and sizes of the colliding objects ( which is fundamental for the dipole model interpretation of high - energy collisions ) .",
    "this breaking of diagonality of the interaction in impact parameter should not be surprising : indeed , since the transverse momentum and impact parameter are conjugate variables , conserving one of them in the interaction does not allow to conserve the other one .",
    "in fact , this effect is analogous to that discussed already in @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) as both the colour dipole model and @xmath0 factorization ( with exact kinematics ) are currently used for the description of data @xcite , our result indicates that such analyses must be taken with some care .",
    "\\(ii ) it also emphasizes the need for a complete next - to - leading order calculation which would elucidate the problem of compatibility of the two approaches and also provide the necessary information on the correct energy scale .",
    "\\(iii ) in absence of such a complete calculation , one may only speculate about the origin of the difficulty .",
    "one possibility is that , by including other missing higher order contributions , one recovers the compatibility between the two pictures .",
    "this would mean that the theorem of @xmath0 factorization should be replaced by a sort of `` impact parameter factorization '' .",
    "another possible scenario is that @xmath0 factorization at higher orders will not correspond to impact parameter conservation and thus the dipole model must be abandoned or reformulated .",
    "\\(iv ) speculating about the possibilities of modification of the colour dipole model , one may think necessary to add ( at the next - to - leading order ) the contributions @xmath50 with the two new dipoles having energies of the same order of magnitude .",
    "such a contribution would certainly require a re - interpretation of the conservation of transverse positions in high - energy scattering and thus make more plausible the compatibility with @xmath0 factorization .",

    "<S> it is shown that the colour dipole approach to hard scattering at high energy is fully compatible with @xmath0 factorization at the leading logarithm approximation ( in @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relations between the dipole amplitudes and unintegrated diagonal and non - diagonal gluon distributions are given . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that including the exact gluon kinematics in the @xmath0 factorization formula destroys the conservation of transverse position vectors and thus is incompatible with the dipole model for both elastic and diffractive amplitudes .    </S>"
