    "the current generation of ground based imaging air cherenkov telescopes has been sufficiently sensitive to discover astrophysical gamma - ray emission in the energy range above 100 gev from currently @xmath1 active galactic nuclei ( at the time of writing ) .",
    "the current record - holder as the most distant known gamma - ray source is observed at a red shift of @xmath2.@xcite at this distance , the effect of pair production becomes important at energies above 100  gev leading to the energy - dependent absorption of the primary beam ( see fig .",
    "[ iso ] ) . for objects at a red shift of @xmath3 , absorption is only of relevance at photon energies above 10 tev . +",
    "this energy - dependent effect is well known.@xcite however , the uncertainties ( by roughly a factor of two ) on the amount of background light translate directly to uncertainties on the predicted optical depth @xmath4 , which widely changes the resulting attenuation @xmath5 . +",
    "additional effects related to the production of secondary photons in inter - galactic cascades may have an impact on the observed energy spectrum .",
    "@xcite the observable ( secondary ) flux depends on the intervening magnetic field and plasma properties which can lead to quenching of the cascade . + finally , phenomena beyond the standard model of particle physics could modify this picture in characteristic ways ( see below ) . + before turning to the modifications of the pair production processes , i summarize the current state of knowledge on the extra - galactic background light ( ebl ) drawn from the imprint of absorption in the observed gamma - ray spectra ( for an extended review , see also [ ] ) .",
    "the direct observation of the extra galactic background light ( ebl ) is strongly affected by the dominating _ foreground _ emission from re - processed light in the interplanetary and interstellar medium ( see e.g. , [ ] ) . the indirect approach to infer the amount of ebl present in the universe through the energy dependent imprint of absorption in gamma - ray spectra does not suffer from this uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , it is in principle possible to follow the evolution of the ebl by measuring sources at various red shifts .",
    "+ while in the past , the observed spectra were not determined with sufficient accuracy to derive the amount of absorption , current measurements of various bright sources ( predominantly during flaring episodes , @xcite ) , as well as the combination of available source spectra have been used to estimate the absorption and subsequently provide a measure of the amount of ebl present.@xcite + intrinsic to these analyses is however the ignorance of the intrinsic source spectra which is leading to systematic uncertainties on the reconstructed ebl .",
    "the assumption used , e.g. , that the source spectrum is a power - law , may be over - simplifying : specifically for source spectra observed during flaring episodes , transient spectral components may be present at narrow energy intervals.@xcite combining the observations with lower - energy measurements with the pair - production telescope fermi - lat provides additional information on the un - absorbed energy spectrum and the presence of a spectral cut - off .",
    "+ an interesting feature of the intrinsic spectra is an apparent dependence with red shift : the intrinsic source spectra show a hardening with increasing red shift which is not obviously linked with source characteristics .",
    "this trend is also present in a recent analysis,@xcite and has been pointed out already in previous works.@xcite the apparent hardening of the gamma - ray spectra with increasing red shift could be explained by mixing photons with a light pseudoscalar boson.@xcite additional studies indicate that the excess emission is mostly present in the optically thick part of the spectrum.@xcite    ) and alp ( @xmath6 ) number evolution while propagating through [ bild1 ] the magnetized medium of the galaxy cluster environment , the inter - galactic medium ( including photon absorption processes , but no mixing considered ) and finally through the magnetized halo of the milky way . reprinted figure with permission from @xcite copyright ( 2012 ) by the american physical society . ]    ) and alp ( @xmath6 ) number evolution while propagating through [ bild1 ] the magnetized medium of the galaxy cluster environment , the inter - galactic medium ( including photon absorption processes , but no mixing considered ) and finally through the magnetized halo of the milky way .",

    "the claim of an indication for anomalous transparency ( pair production anomaly@xcite ) has recently been shown to ( mostly ) disappear,@xcite when increasing the data set and using an ebl derived from gamma - ray spectroscopy itself .",
    "the initial search for an anomalous transparency was based upon a flux ratio which is sensitive to excess emission when comparing the extrapolated energy spectrum with the observed value.@xcite + here , we introduce a new approach to characterise the spectral shape for different values of optical depth . + the analysis is based upon the so - called _ gamma - ray cosmology _ sample of blazars with known red shift.@xcite instead of using the power - law index determined from the spectrum observed at small optical depth to compare with the measured values at large optical depth,@xcite a local measurement of the _ observed _ logarithmic slope @xmath7 between two differential flux measurements @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is used : @xmath11 such that the _ intrinsic _ logarithmic slope @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is calculated according to an ebl model of choice .",
    "+ flux points with low statistical significance ( and potentially large flux bias),ie . , which differ by less than 1.5 times the flux uncertainty from a zero value are excluded from the sample .",
    "ad hoc _ flux bias correction has been applied to the remaining flux points , where the flux @xmath16 with uncertainty @xmath17 is corrected in the following way : @xmath18^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath19 derived from a simple toy monte carlo assuming purely gaussian statistics ( a similar procedure is outlined in [ ] ) .",
    "+ the resulting values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are averaged in intervals of @xmath4 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : dom ] and [ fig : bw ] , the data are shown for two different types of absorption models .",
    "the _ observed _ slope @xmath20 ( lower set of points in green ) displays a power - law index of approximately @xmath22 at small optical depth ( in the first bin ) . up to an optical depth of @xmath23 , the _ observed _ slope softens to an average value of @xmath24 , consistent with _ intrinsic _ @xmath25 .",
    "however , with further increasing optical depth , the _ observed _ slope @xmath20 increases again until for @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "+ the result is very similar for both models and repeats also for other tested models of gamma - ray absorption .",
    "the observations discussed above as well as the update on searches for anomalous transparency presented here indicate a puzzling feature in the observed gamma - ray spectra : at optical depth @xmath26 the spectra have a similar spectral slope as at small optical depth , consistent with previous analysis which have considered the global ( ie .",
    ", over the entire observable energy range covered for each source ) power - law index.@xcite      in the presence of transversal magnetic fields , gamma - rays can mix with a light ( mass in the range of @xmath28ev - nev ) pseudoscalar fundamental bosons leading to an attenuation of the energy spectrum above a critical energy which depends on the mass of these particles ( so - called _ alps_- axion - like particles ; for a review see [ ] ) as well as on the magnetic field.@xcite + while the photonic part of the propagating beam is attenuated in the ebl , the pseudoscalar fraction can in principle propagate largely unimpeded until reconverting , e.g. , in the galactic magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "[ bild1 ] , note , the mixing in the inter - galactic space was assumed to be negligible ) .",
    "the mixing can at most convert @xmath29 of an unpolarized photon beam into an alps beam , of which at most @xmath30 can reconvert into photon fields .",
    "overall , in the most favorable conditions , a fraction of @xmath31 of the initial photon beam can re - appear through the effect of conversion and re - conversion .",
    "this component will be however dominating over the attenuated beam if the optical depth @xmath32 ( assuming no mixing in inter - galactic space , the photon beam suffers absorption and is depleted to @xmath33 ; when entering the re - conversion region in the halo magnetic field of the milky way , in maximum mixing , 1/3 of the photons will convert to alps , leaving @xmath34 , where the last term is the re - converted alps part of the beam ; in total @xmath35 can be observed and once @xmath36 , the reconverted part of the beam will dominate ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the observation of a hardening of the observed spectrum for the part of the spectra observed at an optical depth @xmath37 as discussed above .",
    "note , a more quantitative study has been carried out indicating that the required mixing to explain the observations has to be close to maximum , still consistent with other constraints on possible photon - alps coupling.@xcite     ( observed ) and @xmath21 ( corrected for absorption ) for the ebl absorption model reconstructed from gamma - ray spectra.@xcite [ fig : bw ] ]     ( observed ) and @xmath21 ( corrected for absorption ) for the ebl absorption model reconstructed from gamma - ray spectra.@xcite [ fig : bw ] ]      the effect of lorentz invariance violation is expected to be of relevance at energies approaching the planck scale .",
    "however , for the propagation of gamma - rays at tev energies , the threshold for pair production is shifted leading to an energy dependent and characteristic deviation of the optical depth at energies above @xmath38 tev.@xcite for some nearby objects like e.g. , mkn 501 ( @xmath39 ) or mkn  421 ( @xmath40 ) , the observed gamma - ray spectra are sensitive to this effect , observations with future instruments will have the potential to search for the spectral imprint with sources at larger distances.@xcite the analysis of gamma - ray spectra presented here indicates indeed a deviation from the expected absorption .",
    "however , the effect is not tied to a particular energy scale , but rather to a level of absorption ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is at first sight inconsistent with the expectation of a lorentz - invariance violating effect .",
    "however , there are some proposals in which a more complicated structure of the vacuum would lead to a variation of the photon dispersion relation depending on the line of sight or distance of the object.@xcite in this case , such a model may offer an explanation for the observations",
    ".      blazars and flat - spectrum radio quasars are attractive candidates for the sites of acceleration of ultra - high energy cosmic - rays ( uhecrs ) , even though neither the directions of uhecrs nor of energetic neutrinos have so far been found to correlate significantly with nearby blazars or active galactic nuclei in general.@xcite in a scenario , where blazars are powerful accelerators of uhecrs with a luminosity ( in particle acceleration ) of @xmath42ergs / s , the observed gamma - ray emission may be of secondary origin .",
    "while the approach works well in individual cases,@xcite it requires fine - tuning to explain all the data : the transition of primary to secondary gamma - ray dominated part of the energy spectrum depends only on the ratio of primary gamma - ray luminosity and uhecr luminosity .",
    "unless this ratio is tied to the distance in the right way , it would be difficult to re - produce the observed hardening of the spectrum .",
    "the gamma - ray spectra of extra - galactic sources in the energy range from 100 gev to tens of tev continue to be of interest in the context of propagation in the extra - galactic medium .",
    "the standard picture of pair - production absorption in the extra - galactic background light seems to be incomplete .",
    "it does not explain the observations , especially in the tail of the energy spectra observed at optical depth @xmath43 , where in the case of maximum mixing of photons with light axion - like particles , a recovery of the absorbed photon beam is expected to dominate .",
    "alternative explanations ( including effects of lorentz - invariance violation as well as uhecr induced cascades ) are attractive possibilities but require additional assumptions / fine - tuning . clearly , the future gamma - ray instrumentations , both at the high energy end ( e.g. , taiga - hiscore@xcite , lhaaso@xcite ) as well as at the low energy end ( cta@xcite ) will provide important observations to clarify the observational situation .",
