    "the two - arm spectrometer of the dirac experiment @xcite at cern includes a set of planar drift chambers with about 2000 signal wires in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2-planes .",
    "hit wire signals are digitized in on - chamber mounted time - to - digital converters ( tdcs ) .",
    "numbers of hit wires in @xmath0-planes are processed in the trigger system of the setup to find the tracks in both arms of the spectrometer .",
    "the tracks found are compared with respect to the relative momentum of pion pairs @xcite and the accepted events are collected during beam spill in the vme buffer memories .    a feature of these drift chambers is the high current mode of operation @xcite i.e. the signals from sense wires typically have an amplitude of 1  ma and a width about 20  ns at half - maximum .    the on - chamber mounted tdc board is the main unit of the readout system .",
    "it combines 16 input signal discriminators , the 16-channel tdc itself and a data buffer .",
    "the boards are immediately plugged in the signal plane connectors .",
    "up to 8 boards can be read out via a common bus . in comparison with the standard configuration ,",
    "in which the discriminators and the tdcs are separate modules and chambers operate in the proportional mode , the described system has the following advantages :    * the number of modules in the system is reduced ; * the number of cables is reduced .",
    "there are no external connections between the discriminators and the tdcs ; * there are no the time measurement distortions due to crosstalks in a long flat cable , which usually connects the discriminators and the tdcs in the standard configuration .",
    "note that crosstalks between the adjacent channels in a flat cable 30 m long cause a pulse jitter about 1.5  ns ; * due to the high threshold , 0.1  ma , of input discriminators practically all external pickup noise is rejected .",
    "the readout system consists of 8 segments , which handle the hit wire signals in parallel ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "after reset the tdc boards continuously accept the hits until a common stop signal arrives at the readout system .",
    "it causes acquisition to stop and processing of the recorded hits to start .",
    "the hits found inside a tdc time window are loaded into the on - board buffer memory . after all tdcs in the segment have completed the data processing , the selected hit data are transferred from the buffers to the bus driver ( bd ) and , in parallel , to the trigger system ( hit wire numbers only ) .",
    "the tdc boards are read out in a geographical addressing mode , empty buffer memories are skipped . due to a pipeline structure of the tdc boards the recorded data are processed and the selected ones are read out at the rate of 100  ns per hit .    depending on state of the control bus m the individual lines",
    "st are used to fan out the common stop signal or to read out the tdc buffer .",
    "the flag f indicates the board status . similarly the bs and bf lines control the bus driver . with respect to the common",
    "stop the hits selected in a segment will be available for processing in the trigger system at the access time :    @xmath3    where @xmath4  ns is the constant delay , @xmath5 is the maximum number of hits recorded in one of all tdc boards , @xmath6 is the number of hits selected in all tdcs of the segment and 3 is the number of `` pumping '' clocks .    to minimize the access time each @xmath0-plane is connected to only one segment of the readout system .",
    "the selected hits are stored in the bus drivers until the readout controller receives the event accepted or reset signal from the trigger system .",
    "an accepted event is numbered and transferred into the vme buffer memory ( buf ) at the rate of 100  ns / hit .",
    "the reset discards all temporary recorded data . during the beam spill",
    "the readout system is hardware controlled .",
    "it requires only three external control signals : stop , event accepted and reset . during the interval between the spills the vme processor reads out all vme buffers @xcite .",
    "a two - wire bus ( sd ) is used to set the tdcs time window .",
    "the bus drivers and the controller are placed near the drift chambers in a nim crate , which is also used to power the readout system . due to the setup layout",
    "three such systems are used to read out all drift chambers .",
    "the 16-channel tdc board discriminates , digitizes , selects and buffers the hit wire signals .",
    "the last 16 hits in each channel can be recorded .",
    "the tdc operates in the common stop mode therefore no additional delay in the recording channel is required .",
    "the tdc board ( fig.[fig2 ] ) consists of an input discriminators ( dsr ) , a time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) , a magnitude comparator ( cmp ) , a buffer memory ( bm ) , and a control unit ( ctr ) .",
    "two 8-bit shift registers ( srg ) are used to set the maximum time measurement range and the offset value , i.e. the far and near time thresholds , respectively .",
    "the tdc time window is defined as difference between these thresholds .",
    "the input discriminator consists of a protection scheme ( bav99 ) and an ultrafast voltage comparator mvl407s @xcite ( one chip per four channels ) .",
    "the input resistance of 300  @xmath7 was chosen to match the wave impedance of the signal wire .",
    "a test pulse is applied to all inputs via 3  k@xmath7 resistors .",
    "the tdc itself is built on two mtd133b integrated circuits @xcite connected together by a common data bus .",
    "the mtd133b is an 8-channel multihit time - to - digital converter , which measures the separation in time between hits ( transitions ) arriving at the common input and each of eight independent channels .",
    "each channel accepts up to 16 hits . with the acquisition clock frequency of 250 mhz",
    "the time difference is measured with the 0.5  ns least count in the 16-bit dynamic range .    in the acquisition mode",
    "the mtd133b continuously accepts the input hits until the tdc board receives the stop signal ( st line ) .",
    "then the bus driver disables the hit acquisition and starts data processing and buffering . during this phase",
    "the mtd133b computes the time intervals between the recorded hits and the common stop signal and compares them to the far time threshold .",
    "the data less than the threshold are put on the common data bus .",
    "note that after three `` pumping '' clocks a new valid data word is asserted on each readout clock until all the recorded hits are processed .",
    "the external magnitude comparator ( cmp ) compares the time intervals to the near time threshold .",
    "the data which exceed this threshold are loaded into the buffer memory .",
    "thus this buffer contains only hits which arrived at the tdc within the preset time window .",
    "after the last recorded hit has been processed , the tdc board sets a flag on the f line .",
    "the bus driver waits until all tdcs in the segment complete data processing , then switches the f lines to the buffer memory and reads out non - empty memories in a priority order .",
    "this operation is completed when all tdc boards reset the f flags .",
    "the analog and digital parts of the printed circuit board have separate ground and power planes which are connected to the power supply via the differential lc filters .",
    "the discriminator outputs are also differential .",
    "this technique provides an isolation factor more than 66  db .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "the tdc board is designed to operate without tuning and therefore only an after - production test is required .",
    "the test equipment ( fig.[fig3 ] ) is based on the specially designed delay generator operating in the range from 10  ns to 260  @xmath8s with the delay step of 20  ps . in the single hit mode the module generates one hit and",
    "one stop at each trigger coming from the camac bus . in the burst mode up to 16 hits and",
    "one stop are generated .",
    "a set of programs has been written to test all components of the tdc board .",
    "they allows to test and visualise the performance of each tdc channel in the range of time interval between hit and stop from 20  ns to 2048  ns with the step of 20  ps in the single hit or burst mode .",
    "also there is a possibility to scan automatically all positions of the time window in each tdc channel to test the efficiency of the hit selection .",
    "the features of the above - described readout system result in the reduced number of modules ( there are no separate discriminator boards and tdc modules ) , a small numbers of cables and high noise immunity . at the threshold of 0.1",
    "ma the drift chamber efficiency is about 99% and the spatial resolution equals to 85  @xmath9 m @xcite .",
    "the readout system has been successfully operating in the dirac experiment since 1999 . at a typical rate",
    "about @xmath10 counts per spill ( 0.45  s ) in each arm of the spectrometer the average access time is about 2  @xmath9s . the accepted data are transferred to the vme buffers , on average , within 5  @xmath8s .",
    "this operation is not the longest readout of the whole setup and thus it does not increase the setup dead time .",
    "we would like to thank l.nemenov and m.ferro-luzzi for support and coordination of this work , v.kruglov for fruitful discussions and participation in the common job for the system implementation , a.kulikov for support of the setup trigger system , v.olshevsky and s.trusov for readout software support and their help in testing the tdc board prototype .",
    "the work was partially supported by the russian foundation for basic research , project 010217756 ."
