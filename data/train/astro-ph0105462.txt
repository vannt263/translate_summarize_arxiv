    "it is sobering to realize that nearly two decades after the ground - breaking observations of ngc 1068 by @xcite showing that some seyfert 2 galaxies ( s2 ) are basically the same class of object as seyfert 1s ( s1 ) but viewed from a different direction , we still do nt know for certain if this `` unified model '' ( um ) is indeed applicable to _ all _ seyfert galaxies . besides ngc 1068 , there have been plenty of other examples of polarized ( hidden ) broad line regions seen in reflected light ( hblr ) in nearly all types of active galactic nuclei ( agns ; see review by antonucci 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , while there is no question that this um applies to _ some _ type 2 agns , the questions still remain : are _ all _ s2s the same as s1s seen from a different line of sight ? if not , what is the fraction of seyfert galaxies containing s1 ? and what is the exact nature of those s2s that do not show any hblrs : is it an intrinsic property ( i.e. , `` pure '' s2 ) , or are the hblrs too obscured to be detected ?    several polarimetric surveys have attempted to address some of these questions @xcite .",
    "common problems often faced include : ( i ) severe biases in the polarized galaxy sample ; to maximize the use of telescope time , most early spectropolarimetric targets were chosen simply because they were known to be polarized , and ( ii ) number of objects too small for statistical study ; since polarimetric observations are time consuming and tedious , it is difficult to find a suitably large sample of s2s with hblr .",
    "what is needed is a systematic search of a large , complete and unbiased sample of s2s . in this letter , we report the main results and implications of a large survey , of two of the most complete , and best studied samples of seyfert galaxies : the cfa @xcite and the extended 12@xmath0 m  ( rush , malkan , & spinoglio 1993 , rms93 ) samples . the cfa sample has been revered as the most complete and unbiased sample of nearby seyferts that are optically selected ( however , see below ) .",
    "the extended 12@xmath0 m  sample has the advantage of being significantly larger , thereby enabling better statistical analysis , and by selecting in the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) , it is more suitable for detecting buried agns that might have been missed by optical selection technique alone .",
    "comparison of the two samples should prove most revealing .",
    "we carried out the spectropolarimetric observations of s2s selected from the cfa and 12@xmath0 m  samples mostly at lick and palomar observatories , with a few at keck observatory , during 13 runs between 1993 december and 2000 january .",
    "detailed description of the observations and data will be presented in a separate paper ( paper ii ) . typically , each target was observed through the usual polarimetric sequence of 4 @xmath2  900s or 4 @xmath2  1200s , and repeated when necessary to improve s / n . for objects observed at keck , the typical exposure time was 4 @xmath2  300s . since the sample objects all have comparable brightness , these observations probe to similar level of sensitivity for the entire sample .",
    "we also supplement our observations with results from previous surveys .",
    "observation of the cfa sample is complete .",
    "we observed only those classified as s2 by osterbrock & martel ( 1993 , om93 ) .",
    "intermediate seyferts ( i.e. , 1.8 , 1.9 ) were excluded . one object , mrk 461 , for which om93 did not obtain spectrum , turns out to be a h ii galaxy based on our observations , and thus will be discarded from the seyfert consideration . in total , 14 s2s were observed from the cfa sample .    for the 12@xmath0 m  sample , the survey is essentially complete .",
    "in addition to those in table 2 of rms93 , we also include one additional object ( mcg -4 - 2 - 18 ) from their starburst ( sb ) galaxy list ( their table 3 ) and three objects ( ngc 3147 , 3822 , 6552 ) from their `` normal '' galaxy list ( their table 5 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of these sources reveal that they clearly show high ionization spectra worthy of s2 .",
    "we find that 15 objects in table 2 of rms93 are indeed liners , h ii or sb galaxies misclassified as s2 , and thus can not be counted in the statistical analysis of seyfert galaxies . in the course of the survey ,",
    "most nevertheless have been observed .",
    "we will refer to these galaxies as the hls sample ( for h ii , liner , sb galaxies ) , and will present their data in paper ii , but show them in plots in the current paper .",
    "finally , one source , ngc 1194 , is a s1 and will not be considered further .",
    "the total number of s2s in the 12@xmath0 m  sample is thus 51 , of which 43 have been observed either by this or other studies .",
    "most of the remaining eight un - observed s2s are unreachable by telescopes employed in this survey .    in table  1",
    "we summarize the main results of our survey .",
    "the most relevant optical spectropolarimetric , x - ray , ir , and radio properties of the observed galaxies are presented .",
    "besides confirming the spectropolarimetric properties of several galaxies , we discover one new hblr s2 ( ngc 7682 ) in the cfa sample , and four ( f025811136 , mcg -3 - 58 - 7 , ngc 5995 , ngc 6552 ) in the 12@xmath0 m  sample .",
    "figure [ radirc ] shows the two indicators of the relative power of the agn : @xmath3  vs. @xmath1 .",
    "the first measures the nonthermal radio emission normalized by the far - infrared emission ( fir , @xmath4 ) , believed to arise mostly from circumnuclear sb and star formation ( e.g. , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2001 ; ruiz et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the second is the contribution of the mid - ir emission ( @xmath5 ) , believed to come 0.2 cm    mostly from surrounding dust ( e.g. , torus ) heated by the agn @xcite , relative to the fir emission .",
    "a separation is clearly detected , with _",
    "s2s identified as having hblr occupying a clearly distinct region of the plot compared to those without detection of hblr .",
    "_ the hblr s2s tend to show both higher @xmath3  and @xmath1  ratios .",
    "this clearly marks them as truly energetic agn , containing a `` monster '' which is the hidden s1 nucleus . on the other hand , those s2s and liners / sb galaxies without hblr present `` colder ''",
    ", less energetic ratios : @xmath1  @xmath6 0.25 and @xmath3  @xmath6 0.01 .",
    "the warmer infrared color for hblr objects has been noted in numerous previous studies ( e.g. , hutchings & neff 1991 ; heisler et al .",
    "1997 ; tran et al .",
    "1999 ; gu et al .",
    "if all s2 are intrinsically similar , there is no _ a priori _ reason for them to lie in such distinct regions of figure [ radirc ] .",
    "@xcite also advocate the use of another `` diagnostic diagram '' involving [ o iii ] @xmath75007/h@xmath8  vs. @xmath1  to separate the hblr from the non - hblr s2s , with hblr s2s showing generally higher ionization and warmer color . with the current combined cfa+12@xmath0 m  sample , the median values of [ o iii ] @xmath75007/h@xmath8  are 6.8@xmath91.5 and 9.9@xmath91.3 for the non - hblr and hblr s2s , respectively .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath1  are 0.18@xmath90.10 and 0.49@xmath90.19 , respectively , with virtually 0% probability that they come from the same population .",
    "so the dichotomy is clear between these two populations .",
    "the question that arises is : is the lack of hblrs in these galaxies due to the lack of an energetic agn ( and hence blr ) , or to such impregnably high obscuration that we can not even detect the signal from the buried agn ( i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath5 ) ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the scattering may take place very close to the nucleus , in the inner `` throat '' of the torus , and non - hblr s2s are perhaps those with the torus axes tipped at larger inclinations , resulting in higher obscuration of the nucleus and greater obstruction of the scattering region .    to answer the question posed above",
    ", we explore the level of obscuration in these galaxies in the x - ray regime . based on a smaller sample",
    ", @xcite argued that the absorbing column density @xmath11 of hblr and non - hblr s2s do not show any significant difference .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , suggested that hblr s2s may have on average smaller @xmath11 than non - hblr s2s , using data available for a heterogeneous sample of hblr s2s . for our larger and more complete sample",
    "we show in figure [ nhdist ] the distribution of @xmath11 .",
    "formally , the mean log(@xmath11 ) values for the hblr and non - hblr s2s are 23.84@xmath90.24 and 23.86@xmath90.29 , respectively  virtually identical ! arguably , the @xmath11 dataset is incomplete and subject to large uncertainties , and thus may not reflect the true nature of the obscuration in s2s .    as another diagnostic of the obscuration",
    ", we consider the ratio of hard x - ray ( 210 kev ) flux relative to the fir flux , @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ hxirc ] displays the ratio @xmath12  vs. @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath12  is mainly a measure of the obscuration @xcite , but it also represents the strength of the buried agn engine . note that objects with higher obscuration show lower @xmath12  ratio , as expected , and objects with higher agn power relative to the surrounding stellar radiation lie toward the _ right _ of the diagram .",
    "the data are consistent with the model of @xcite , whose three trajectories corresponding to three representative values of @xmath11 are overplotted on fig .",
    "[ hxirc ] .",
    "pure s2s and hls galaxies occupy the _ bottom left _ for all @xmath11 . for a similar range of @xmath11 ( e.g. , same color points ) , as the broad - line , energetic agn component grows , the object moves to the _ right _ , and slightly up . decreased obscuration then shifts it vertically up in the diagram .",
    "close examination of fig .",
    "[ hxirc ] suggests that while the vertical offset is predominantly due to obscuration , the slight trend upward to the top right can be attributed to increased agn luminosity .",
    "therefore , since the distributions of points with and without hblr overlap much with each other over a broad range in @xmath12 , we conclude that _ non - hblr s2 are not any more obscured than hblr s2 _ , consistent with the @xmath11 data , and in contrast with expectation from the @xcite model .",
    "figures [ nhdist ] and [ hxirc ] also show that the non - hblr s2s and hls galaxies do not show any evidence for higher level of obscuration than hblr s2s , as would be expected if starburst activity , which tends to be higher in the former , provides an `` extra '' source of obscuration @xcite in addition to the torus .",
    "the balmer decrement may also be used as a potential probe of the obscuration . for the current combined cfa+12@xmath0 m  sample , the mean h@xmath13/h@xmath8",
    "is 7.16 @xmath9 4.70 and 7.39 @xmath9 5.51 for hblr and non - hblr s2s , respectively .",
    "ks test shows that there is no statistical difference between these distributions , with a probability @xmath14 for the null hypothesis that the two datasets are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "this confirms the similar x - ray result that there is no difference in obscuration between the two s2 types .",
    "our result disagrees with the suggestion of @xcite and @xcite , based on smaller , incomplete samples , that non - hblr s2s tend to display higher galactic extinction .",
    "thus the correlation in figure [ radirc ] , combined with the similarity in obscuration for both the hblr and non - hblr s2s lead us to our most important conclusion : _ non - hblr seyfert 2s do not show hblrs simply because they most likely do not have any . _",
    "the um model apparently is not applicable to _ all _ seyfert galaxies .",
    "there appears to be two types of s2s , one containing an energetic agn with blr , and the other possessing a less energetic agn with weak or absent blr , whose energy output maybe dominated by other nuclear and circumnuclear processes such as starbursts .",
    "this is the `` pure s2 '' model @xcite .    as further support for the pure s2 model ,",
    "very recent analysis of x - ray observations by @xcite shows that some s2s appear to show very little or no absorption , and yet display no broad lines , as would be expected if no obscuration is present .",
    "there are also theoretical reasons to believe that intrinsically weak agns may lack blrs .",
    "nicastro ( 2000 , see also collin & hur 2001 ) suggests that the blr arises from the vertical disk wind from the accretion disk at a radius where it is unstable to radiation pressure . below a certain critical accretion rate , such wind , and hence blr , can not exist .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently weak agn , no blrs are expected .",
    "the `` standard '' um also can not account for the apparent enhanced star forming activity @xcite , or higher frequency of companions @xcite , in s2 compared to s1 ( see however , schmitt et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the pure s2 model ,",
    "the origin of these differences is clear : pure s2 galaxies are intrinsically different from s1 ; they reside in denser environments , which lead to a higher incidence of galaxy interactions , and hence star formation .",
    "we emphasize that the lack of hblr in the non - detected objects can not be attributed to the overwhelming contribution of starlight in the host galaxies .",
    "rather , it is the strength of the agn engine that seems to be dominant factor in determining the visibility of hblr .",
    "starlight level in hblr s2s reaching @xmath15 80 - 90% is quite common @xcite .",
    "both hblrs and non - hblrs appear to have similar levels of starlight domination , and the non - detection of a hblr seems to be unrelated to it @xcite . the fact that many starburst - dominated s2s do contain hblrs ( e.g. , ic 3639 , f05189 - 2524 ; gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "2001 ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2001 ) also strongly suggests that the detectability of hblr is not simply a function of the contribution of the starburst component relative to agn power . for our sample , the mean 20 cm radio powers in units of log solar luminosities for the hblrs and non - hblrs are 3.87 @xmath9 0.60 and 3.10 @xmath9 0.82 , respectively .",
    "ks test shows that the two distributions are significantly different ( @xmath16=0.015 $ ] ) , confirming a similar finding by @xcite for a limited number of objects . very recently , thean et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also confirm that radio sources in the 12@xmath0 m  sample hblr s2s do indeed contain more powerful radio sources .",
    "so , not only are the relative radio to fir fluxes different between the two types of s2s , the absolute radio luminosity also appears to be significantly different .",
    "the detection rate of hblrs is significantly lower in the cfa sample ( 4/14 = 29% ) than the 12@xmath0 m  sample ( 21/43 = 49% ) , although the cfa detection rate is similar to that reported by previous studies ( e.g. , moran et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the higher detection rate in the 12@xmath0 m  sample suggests that previous optically selected samples may have missed many dust obscured agns .",
    "as argued by rms93 , the cfa sample appeared to be incomplete at both the high and low ends of the luminosity function . according to their estimate ,",
    "the incompleteness factor is about 50% . assuming that this translates directly to the same factor in the undercounting of hblr s2s , it brings the detection rate of hblrs in the cfa sample to @xmath15 45% , in much better agreement with the 12@xmath0 m  number .",
    "thus , the @xmath1750% detection rate of hblr in s2s may be more representative than the lower 3035% suggested by the cfa sample and other optically defined samples .",
    "this research has been carried out through the years by hdt while at caltech , lick observatory , llnl , and the johns hopkins university .",
