    "large redshift surveys of galaxies have played a quite important role for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies . in 1990",
    "s , several new deep redshift surveys using large optical telescopes were carried out : e.g. , canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ; lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) , hawaii deep field ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) , autofib / ldss survey ( ellis et al .",
    "1996 ) , the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc1,2 surveys ; yee et al .",
    "1996 and carlberg et al .",
    "some of those surveys reach as deep as @xmath13 , and we have obtained some information about the formation and evolution of galaxies up to @xmath13 . however , little has been known about the properties of @xmath14 galaxies from such redshift surveys due to the limited depth of spectroscopic observations .",
    "even if one uses lris with a keck telescope , the limiting magnitude of spectroscopy is about r@xmath15 , while the limiting magnitude of photometry with hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) wfpc2 is @xmath16 .",
    "there is , however , so called ` photometric redshift technique ' , which enables us to measure redshifts of faint galaxies .",
    "photometric redshift technique was originally suggested by baum et al .",
    "( 1963 ) to determine redshifts of some clusters of galaxies based on multi - band photometry using mean spectra of their member galaxies .",
    "there were , however , only a few applications of the technique ( e.g. , koo 1985 ; loh & spillar 1986 ) before it revived recently to study distant galaxies , in particular , faint galaxies found in the hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams et al . 1996 ) ( connolly et al . 1995 ; lanzetta , yahil , & fernndez - soto 1996 , 1998 ; gwyn & hartwick 1996 ; mobasher et al .",
    "1996 ; sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; connolly et al .",
    "photometric redshift technique is the only method available at present to infer the redshifts of galaxies beyond the spectroscopic limit .    in this work",
    "we improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts of galaxies in the hdf by using a set of template spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we treat the internal absorption of galaxies and the extinction due to intergalactic hi clouds more carefully than previous studies .",
    "we adopt a technique based on a standard @xmath0 minimizing method with a template set which consists of simulated seds .",
    "we apply it to a photometry catalog of galaxies in the hdf ( fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1999 ) , which is the deepest catalog available with some spectroscopic redshifts .    the detailed method , adopted parameters of simulated seds , and the comparison between our photometric redshifts and spectroscopic redshifts are described in   2 .",
    "we show in ",
    "3 the comparison of our improved photometric redshifts with previous studies and the validity of our result .",
    "we present our improved photometric redshift for the hdf galaxies in   4 , where we also discuss the properties of the hdf galaxies such as redshift distribution and cosmic star formation rate .",
    "conclusions are given in ",
    "we may classify photometric redshift techniques into two categories .",
    "one is the training - set method ( connolly et al .",
    "1997 , wang et al . 1999 ) and the other is the @xmath0 minimizing method ( gwyn & hartwick 1996 ; ; mobasher et al . 1996 , 1999",
    "; sawicki et al . 1997 ; giallongo et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the training - set method first makes an empirical formula by fitting polynominals to the photometry data of galaxies with known redshifts .",
    "it then applies the same formula to photometry data of new galaxy samples to determine their photometric redshifts .",
    "this method is superior to the other in the point that the more galaxies we observe for the training set , the more accurate photometric redshifts we obtain .",
    "therefore , yee ( 1998 ) called it the empirical training - set method . for low-_z",
    "_ galaxies , the training - set method seems to work more robust than the @xmath0  method , because it is based on real observed galaxy spectra and because the empirical formula can be determined accurately using a large number of spectroscopic samples ( connolly et al .",
    "1997 ) . recently",
    ", comparably accurate redshifts are obtained by a simpler training - set method which adopts binning of galaxies according to observed colors ( wang , bahcall & turner 1998 ; wang , turner , & bahcall 1999 ) .",
    "csabai , connolly , & szalay ( 1999 ) also succeeded in obtaining accurate photometric redshifts by combining the training - set method and the @xmath0  method .",
    "however , it is difficult to make a good training set for high redshift galaxies , since the number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts is still small",
    ". also we should be cautious in applying the empirical formula obtained at low redshifts to high redshift galaxies , since significant evolution is expected in their seds .",
    "hence , in this study , we use the @xmath0  minimizing method which can include spectral evolution of galaxies directly .",
    "this method searches for the best - fit sed and the redshift of a galaxy by comparing the observed sed of the galaxy with templates prepared in advance . in general , templates are made either from observed spectra of nearby galaxies or from simulated spectra based on a population synthesis model .",
    "coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ; hereafter cww ) and kinney et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1996 ) are widely used sources of observed spectra for the hdf galaxies .",
    "lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 ) and fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used cww s and kinney et al.s spectra .",
    "however , the use of the observed seds of nearby galaxies may make it difficult to directly take the effects of galaxy evolution into account .",
    "accordingly , in this paper we use simulated spectra based on a recent population synthesis model .",
    "gwyn & hartwick ( 1996 ) also used simulated spectra based on bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) made their templates based on both observed spectra ( cww ) and simulated spectra by bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ; hereafter bc96 ) .",
    "we use a stellar population synthesis model by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ; hereafter ka97 ) to make template seds .",
    "ka97 includes the stellar evolutionary tracks after the asymptotic giant branch in addition to the conventional tracks .",
    "hence the model predicts uv flux of galaxies reasonably well , or at least , as good as any previous models .",
    "ka97 was successfully used to obtain photometric redshifts of low redshift galaxies ( kodama , bell , & bower 1999 ) .",
    "our work is the first to use ka97 to obtain photometric redshifts of high-@xmath17 galaxies .",
    "the template seds consist of the spectra of pure disks , pure bulges , and composites made by interpolating the two as shown in table  [ table : sedparam ] .",
    "the parameters for the seds are the power - law index @xmath18 of the initial mass function ( imf ) , the time scale of star formation @xmath19 , the time scale of gas infall from a galactic halo into a disk @xmath20 , and the time when the galactic wind blows @xmath21 . the star formation rate of a galaxy is set to be zero after @xmath21 . for disks , we adopt @xmath22 , @xmath23gyr , @xmath24gyr , and @xmath25gyr ( i.e. , longer than the present age of the universe ) , which are close to the values estimated for the disk of our galaxy .",
    "we adopt from ka97 @xmath26 , @xmath27gyr , @xmath28gyr , and @xmath29gyr for bulges , which are known to reproduce the average color of ellipticals in clusters of galaxies .",
    "we make intermediate sed types by combining a disk component and a bulge component with the same age .",
    "the ratio of the bulge luminosity to the total luminosity in the _ b _ band , which we define as b / t , is changed from 0.1 to 0.9 with an interval of 0.1 .",
    "pure disk seds correspond to young or active star - forming galaxies , and pure bulge seds correspond to elliptical galaxies .",
    "we also prepare very blue seds of age@xmath301gyr , corresponding to blue star - forming galaxies reported by recent deep surveys . in total ,",
    "our basic template set consists of 187 seds .      to simulate the observed seds , we take into account two absorption effects .",
    "one is the internal absorption due to dust in each galaxy .",
    "more light is scattered and absorbed by dust grains in shorter wavelengths .",
    "therefore , internal absorption is one of the key parameters for photometric redshift technique which is sensitive to wavelength dependent effects . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that all galaxies have the same extinction curve , although we change the absolute amount of extinction , indicated by @xmath31 , as a free parameter .    typical features of extinction curves of nearby galaxies including our galaxy are as follows : ( 1 ) the amount of absorption basically increases from the infra - red to the ultraviolet .",
    "( 2 ) some extinction curves have a bump at 2175 , which is usually explained mainly by graphite .",
    "the existence of the bump is reported for our galaxy ( seaton 1979 ; cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) , lmc ( fitzpatrick 1985 ) , and m31 ( bianchi et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , no bump is reported in the extinction curve of smc ( prvot et al . 1984 ; bouchet et al .",
    "gordon , calzetti , & witt ( 1997 ) showed that whether the bump is present or not can not be explained by scattering or geometrical effects , and that galaxies with high star formation activity tend to have no bump in their extinction curves .",
    "there are some studies in which an analytical formula was fitted to observed extinction curves ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ; fitzpatrick 1986,1998 ) .",
    "calzetti ( 1997a ) proposed an analytical formula for nearby star - forming galaxies , including the effect of scattering through star - forming regions .",
    "he inferred that his formula holds for distant young galaxies because these galaxies are probably similar to nearby star - forming galaxies .",
    "we calculated photometric redshifts using the milky - way - like extinction curve by cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) and the smc - like curve by calzetti ( 1997b ) . as a result ,",
    "calzetti s curve gave better results than cardelli et al.s .",
    "therefore , we have decided to adopt the curve by calzetti ( 1997b ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the observed flux and @xmath34 is the intrinsic flux without extinction .",
    "if we normalize the absorption strength by @xmath35 , @xmath36 is expressed as : @xmath37 /\\lambda",
    "+ 1.73\\nonumber\\\\   & & { } \\hspace{2.5 cm } \\mbox{for}\\ 0.63\\,{\\rm\\mu m } \\le \\lambda \\le 1.0\\,{\\rm\\mu m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is not clear whether or not most of distant galaxies have a smc - like extinction curve because of the ambiguity of the uv flux .",
    "figure  [ fig : dustcurve ] shows the observed extinction curves and the model curve calculated by calzetti ( 1997b ) .",
    "the curves are normalized so that @xmath31 is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "we make the template seds using the calzetti s extinction curve with @xmath1 ( dustless ) , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dusttest ] shows the ratio of the flux after extinction with respect to the intrinsic flux as a function of wavelength for three values of @xmath31 .",
    "we also include the effect of absorption due to the intergalactic hi clouds . on the assumption that the _ b_-value , which is the indicator of the velocity dispersion of the clouds , is 35km / s , madau ( 1995 ) computed the median optical depth of the line blanketing as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 correspond to ly-@xmath42 , ly-@xmath43 , ly-@xmath44 , and ly-@xmath45 absorptions , respectively , @xmath46=(1216 , 1026 , 973 , 950 ) , and @xmath47 .",
    "the amount of absorption of lines at shorter wavelengths is negligible compared with these ly-@xmath42 to ly-@xmath45 lines and lyman continuum .",
    "madau ( 1995 ) also showed that the continuum absorption below 912  including lyman limit systems is expressed with a 5% accuracy by : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "here , @xmath51 is the wavelength of the observer s frame and @xmath52=912  and @xmath53 is a redshift of an emitting source .",
    "the total opacity of intergalactic hi clouds , @xmath54 , is expressed by the sum of the opacity due to line absorption @xmath55 and that due to continuum absorption @xmath56 : @xmath57 the relative flux due to intergalactic hi absorption is shown in figure  [ fig : lymantest ] .",
    "we also estimate the amount of the hi absorption integrated within standard broad - band systems as shown in figure  [ fig : lymanmag ] .",
    "we include a variation in opacity as follows .",
    "in addition to madau s original median opacity ( @xmath54 ) , we also use the opacity of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this is because we should take into account a variation of lyman absorptions statistically . here ,",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 are within @xmath62 of the opacity derived by madau ( 1995 ) . as we will see later ,",
    "using three different values around the median value turns out to be more preferable to using just the median opacity .",
    "the fitting procedure to obtain reduced @xmath0  is summarized as follows .",
    "we prepare a set of original 187 seds based on ka97 , which cover a wide range of the spectral - type of observed galaxies .",
    "then , we incorporate the absorption effects due to the internal dust and the intergalactic hi clouds (   [ sec : effects ] ) .",
    "next , we make redshifted seds from @xmath63 to @xmath64 with an interval of 0.05 .",
    "finally , each sed at a given redshift is convolved by the band responses used for the observation .",
    "we compute the flux of template galaxies observed in the @xmath65-th band by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the flux received in @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 is the band response function of the @xmath65-th band .",
    "we compare the convolved flux @xmath70 with the observed flux @xmath71 in each band and calculate @xmath0 by : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of bands used for the observation , @xmath74 is an observational error in the @xmath65-th band .",
    "if flux in the @xmath65-th band is not detected , @xmath75 is set to be zero .",
    "@xmath42 denotes the normalization factor which minimizes the reduced @xmath0 . for a given set of @xmath76 ,",
    "the value of @xmath42 which minimizes @xmath0  is calculated by : @xmath77 then , we find the best - fit sed which gives ` the minimum reduced @xmath0 ' out of all the templates , and the redshift of the best - fit sed is adopted as the photometric redshift of the galaxy .",
    "the most important point to get reliable photometric redshifts is the validity of the template seds .",
    "however , even with an ideal set of templates , large estimation errors in @xmath78 caused by , for example , small signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of photometry are inevitable in some cases .",
    "we should carefully check the results obtained by our simple fitting method . in this work ,",
    "we impose two constraints in order to get robust and accurate estimations .",
    "first , we reject the best - fit seds that give too bright or too faint absolute magnitudes .",
    "we then remove from our sample the best - fit seds which have ` minimum reduced @xmath0 ' larger than some threshold .",
    "it is found that the photometry data of too low s / n tend to give a large value of ` minimum reduced @xmath0 ' .",
    "we apply our method to galaxies in the hdf , where the deepest images of field galaxies were taken .",
    "we use the photometric catalog by fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which is based on seven - band photometry , i.e. , _ ubvi _ with the _ hst _ ( williams et al . 1996 ) and _ jhk _ taken with the 4 m mayall telescope at the kitt peak national observatory ( dickinson et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this catalog also gives one of the most recent estimates of photometric redshifts ( hereafter , @xmath78 ) of the hdf galaxies .",
    "this catalog includes total magnitude and photometric errors for galaxies of @xmath79 with a detection threshold of @xmath80 [ mag arcsec@xmath81 , though the magnitude limit is @xmath82 in the outskirts of the field .",
    "we summarize the limiting magnitudes in table  [ table : obs_hdf ] .",
    "the number of galaxies in the catalog is 1067 in total , and 946 galaxies are in the good s / n region , while 121 galaxies are in the outskirts . out of them , 108 galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts ( hereafter , @xmath83 ) ( cohen et al . 1996 ; steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; lowenthal et al . 1997 ; zepf , moustakas , & davis 1997 ; cohen et al .",

    "we first measure @xmath78  for the spectroscopic sample , using _",
    "ubvijhk _ seven - band magnitudes by the standard @xmath0fitting of the template seds .",
    "figure  [ fig : photoz ] shows the correlation diagram between our @xmath78  and @xmath83 .",
    "we can not find the best - fit sed and fail to measure @xmath78  for two galaxies , and one galaxy at @xmath84 has a very large estimation error , which is called the catastrophic error by sawicki et al .",
    "as seen in fig  [ fig : photoz ] , the redshifts of four galaxies at @xmath83@xmath85 are underestimated by @xmath86 .",
    "a similar trend was seen in fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and some other previous studies ( gwyn & hartwick 1996 ; lanzetta et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; sawicki et al .",
    ". however , we can identify such problematic galaxies by the additional constraints explained in ",
    "[ sec : constraints ] and reject them from the sample to reduce systematic errors .",
    "we examine the minimum reduced @xmath0  value , which is an statistical indicator of the mean residual over _ all _ the observed bands .",
    "figure  [ fig : chi2 ] shows the reduced @xmath0  values against the differences between @xmath78  and @xmath83 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chi2 ] demonstrates that it is difficult to reject the galaxies with bad @xmath78  based on the minimum reduced @xmath0 .",
    "however , we find that the @xmath0  value _ in the b band _ , @xmath87 , is a good indicator for removing bad @xmath78estimates .",
    "we exclude 17 galaxies with @xmath88 from the sample .",
    "the breakdown number of these galaxies for different redshift bins is shown in table  [ table : breakdown ] .",
    "it is probably inappropriate to pursue 100% success in @xmath78 , especially for a sample of very distant galaxies .",
    "it is inevitable that some fraction of the sample fails to give correct @xmath78 .",
    "the important point is how to identify such false @xmath78  and reject them from the sample so that the final sample has the least contamination even with less completeness .",
    "we now have photometric redshifts for 91 out of 108 galaxies in the spectroscopic sample , which are shown in figure  [ fig : photoz_best ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : photoz_best ] , the galaxy pointed by an arrow has very poor s / n .",
    "there are two galaxies with large deviations at @xmath89 .",

    "table  [ table : sigma ] presents the accuracy of our @xmath78  estimates for the 91 galaxies .",
    "we present in table  [ table : sigma ] the standard deviations for three cases , total 91 galaxies , 90 galaxies without the @xmath90 galaxy having a catastrophic error , and 86 galaxies with @xmath91 .",
    "it is found that our method gives almost the same accuracy as previous estimates for galaxies at @xmath8 , and gives more accurate @xmath78  for galaxies at @xmath9 .    in order to show that the @xmath0  minimizing method selects a _ reasonable _ sed from the sed templates for each of the observed galaxies , we present in figure  [ fig : param_specz ]",
    "` 2-d scatter diagrams ' of parameters for the best - fit seds .",

    "figure  [ fig : param_specz ] demonstrates that the distributions of parameters seem to be broadly consistent with the properties of actual galaxies . for example , panel ( a ) , the diagram of ` b / t vs. @xmath31 ' , shows that the population with large @xmath31 is dominated by disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "also in panel ( g ) , the ` @xmath83  vs. age ' diagram , no old galaxies are seen at high redshifts .",
    "we conclude that figure  [ fig : param_specz ] gives indirect support to the validity of our method .    finally , we examine the effects of different s / n on the accuracy of @xmath78  using simulations .",

    "fernndez - soto et al .",
    "and we obtain more accurate @xmath78   over all the redshift range than gwyn et al . and sawicki et al . ,",
    "presumably because 7-band photometry has longer baseline in wavelength and hence is more robust for estimating @xmath78  than 4-band photometry .",
    "the optical 4-band photometry is worse at @xmath106 because in that redshift range the 4000  break of galactic spectra drops out of the optical bands and no significant feature is available .",
    "the photometric redshifts by gwyn & hartwick seem to be worse than sawicki et al.s .",
    "this is probably because sawicki et al .",
    "included lyman absorption into their template seds while gwyn et al . did not .",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : nodust ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : nodust ] indicates that the absence of internal absorption in template seds increases catastrophic errors at @xmath108 .",

    "[ fig : comp](a)-(c ) , we see that galaxies at @xmath113 , especially for the seven - band photometry , tend to be generally estimated at lower redshifts than @xmath83  by the three previous studies .",
    "we are able to remove this systematic error by including three values of opacity due to the intergalactic lyman absorption around the median opacity derived from madau ( 1995 ) : we include @xmath54 , the exact value by madau , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "the systematic errors at @xmath116 emerge if we remove @xmath117 and @xmath118 and use only @xmath54 ( figure  [ fig : tau1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that including a variation of the opacity is essential .",
    "we also examine the template seds with 3@xmath54 , 4@xmath93 , 0.3@xmath54 , and 0.25@xmath54 , and find that the best combination is ( @xmath54,@xmath119,@xmath120 ) .",
    "we should point out that the ambiguities of the stellar synthesis model used for the template seds , especially those in the uv flux , may be coupled with the ambiguity of the internal absorption and the statistical fluctuation of the intergalactic lyman absorption .",
    "if we look at figure  [ fig : param_specz](c ) , best - fit @xmath121 values seem to change with redshift : @xmath122 is more favorable for @xmath83@xmath123 and @xmath118 is more favorable for @xmath83@xmath124",
    ". however , we do not insist that this trend is real considering the fact that we do not have much knowledge about the uv flux of galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , we can obtain more accurate @xmath78  at @xmath105 by carefully treating the intergalactic lyman absorption .",
    "in summary , we find that the internal absorption is effective in reducing the catastrophic errors , while the intergalactic absorption is effective in reducing the systematic error at @xmath116 .",
    "we have used 187 template seds covering a wide range of spectral types . generally speaking , accurate @xmath78 , even for high-@xmath17 galaxies ,",
    "can be obtained using either observed spectra ( cww ; kinney et al .",
    "1993 ) or simulated spectra ( ka97 ; bc96 ) , though absorption effects ( internal and intergalactic absorption ) must be carefully treated . if the purpose of the analysis is just to obtain @xmath78  ( e.g. , fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1999 ) , a few template seds would be sufficient .",
    "however , if we want to determine accurately the sed shape of a target galaxy in order to derive useful information on the sed , much more template seds are necessary as we will see below .",
    "figure  [ fig : photoz_cww4 ] shows @xmath78  of the hdf galaxies using four seds from cww as template seds , which is almost the same procedure as fernndez - soto et al .",
    "adopted ( note that we reproduce the same trend in figure  [ fig : photoz_cww4 ] as seen in figure  [ fig : comp](c ) ) .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath78  based on the four seds is worse than that of our best estimate ( figure  [ fig : comp](c ) ) , but the difference is within a factor of about 2 .",
    "however , there is a large difference in the minimum reduced @xmath0 .",
    "our minimum reduced @xmath0  values are plotted in figure  [ fig : chi2 ] .",
    "figure   [ fig : chi2_cww4 ] is the same plot as figure  [ fig : chi2 ] but for the four - sed case .",
    "the minimum reduced @xmath0  values obtained with the four - sed templates are much larger than those with 3,366 ( @xmath125 ) templates .",
    "the distribution of reduced @xmath0  values can be a measure to determine how many template seds are necessary and sufficient for a given purpose .",
    "we obtain photometric redshifts of 925 galaxies out of the 946 galaxies in the good s /",
    "n region ( see   [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "we call these 925 galaxies the photometric sample .",
    "the redshift distribution @xmath12 of the photometric sample is shown in figure  [ fig : compare_nz ] .",
    "for comparison , the results by fernndez - soto et al .",
    "are superposed .",
    "sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argued that @xmath12 could be an indicator of the error in photometric redshift technique .",
    "they claimed that _ aliasing _ among spectral breaks ( 4000 , balmer , 2800 , and 2635 ) easily leads to an unrealistic @xmath12 , which has typically two prominent peaks at @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the peaks are likely caused by a template set which does not include the internal or the intergalactic absorption .",
    "our @xmath12 does not have such two prominent peaks .",
    "instead , our @xmath12 shows a single peak at @xmath128 and a moderate decrease at @xmath14 at all magnitude bins .",
    "fernndez - soto et al . found that galaxies at @xmath116 have systematically lower photometric redshfits ( figure  [ fig : comp](c ) ) .",
    "we find in this paper that this is attributed to a systematic error which is sensitive to the intergalactic absorption .",
    "this ` small aliasing ' due to the systematic error would make an unlialistic peak at @xmath127 in @xmath12 , especially for faint galaxies . for @xmath129 , the @xmath12 of fernndez - soto et al .",
    "has a prominent peak at @xmath127 .",
    "this is probably due to the small aliasing of galaxies at @xmath130 , because the number of fernndez - soto et al.s galaxies with @xmath9 is smaller than that of our galaxies .",
    "next , we examine @xmath31 of galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : dust_z ] shows the histograms of @xmath31 of the best - fit seds in the five redshift ranges .",
    "the arrow in each redshift range indicates the mean value .",
    "we find that the @xmath31 value of galaxies remains almost constant ( @xmath131 ) for @xmath132 , though it has a small peak at @xmath133 bin .",
    "these values are roughly consistent with those of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath134 derived by sawicki & yee ( 1998 ; @xmath110 ) , because our photometric sample probably includes not only star - forming lyman - break galaxies but also passively evolving elliptical galaxies .",
    "calzetti & heckman ( 1999 ) iteratively calculated the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) and the mean @xmath31 of galaxies using the galactic conversion factor between the gas column density @xmath135 and @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath136 ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) .",
    "the vertical lines plotted in figure  [ fig : dust_z ] are predictions of @xmath31 based on their two typical models .",
    "the model ` a ' corresponds to the cosmic sfr which remains almost constant from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "the model ` b ' corresponds to the cosmic sfr which reaches its peak at @xmath106 and monotonically decreases at @xmath139 .",
    "our results are found to be more consistent with the model ` a ' .",
    "we improve photometric redshifts of 1048 galaxies in the hdf .",
    "a standard @xmath0  minimizing method is adopted for obtaining @xmath78 .",
    "we use 187 template seds representing a wide variety of morphology and age of observed galaxies based on a population synthesis model by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) with two new recipes .",
    "first , the amount of the internal absorption is changed as a free parameter in the range of @xmath1 to @xmath2 with an interval of @xmath3 .",
    "second , the absorption due to intergalactic hi clouds is also changed by a factor of 0.5 , 1.0 , and 1.5 around the opacity given by madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "the total number of template seds is thus @xmath4 , except for the redshift grid .",
    "the introduction of the internal absorption is found to be effective in reducing the catastrophic errors in @xmath78  while the absorption due to the intergalactic hi clouds helps to improve the systematic error in @xmath78  at @xmath116 .",
    "the dispersion @xmath5 of our photometric redshifts with respect to spectroscopic redshifts is @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , which are smaller than the corresponding values ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) by fernndez - soto et al .",
    "significant improvements are obtained , especially at high-@xmath17 . a comparison with previous work and the properties of the best - fit seds for the spectroscopic sample verify the validity of our photometric redshifts .",
    "the redshift distribution of all the 925 galaxies in the photometric sample shows a peak at @xmath140 and a moderate decrease at @xmath14 without any other peak .",
    "the @xmath31 value of galaxies remains almost constant for @xmath132 with a possible weak peak at @xmath133 , which is consistent with the model of a constant cosmic sfr given by calzetti & heckman ( 1999 ) .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to t. kodama & n. arimoto for kindly allowing us to use their new population synthesis code and to anonymous referee for constructive comments .",
