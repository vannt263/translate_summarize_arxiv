    "a symmetry of order parameter is one of central issues in study of superconductivity .",

    "alternative direction of extension was proposed by berezinskii@xcite , where the gap function is `` anisotropic '' in time , i.e. , with an odd - frequency dependence .",
    "this novel state has been investigated extensively in the context of the disordered fermi liquid@xcite , the high-@xmath1 cuprates@xcite , the doped triangular antiferromagnets@xcite , one - dimensional organic systems@xcite , quantum critical spin fluctuations in heavy fermions@xcite , strong - coupling local electron - phonon systems@xcite , and orbitally degenerate systems with full spin polarization@xcite .    besides exploration of possible odd - frequency pairings in homogeneous bulk systems",
    ", it has been argued that the odd - frequency pair amplitude arises in the spatially nonuniform situation , particularly at the surface / interface of the sample , quite ubiquitously@xcite .",
    "it is more promising to induce the odd - frequency pair amplitude in the nonuniform system with lower symmetry .",
    "the case of spatially lower symmetry has also been investigated in noncentrosymmetric systems without inversion symmetry , where even- and odd - parity components are mixed , and it influences many of superconducting properties in a profound way@xcite .",
    "quite analogously a mixing of even- and odd - frequency components should occur in principle , when the time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "the present authors proposed the mixing of the conventional @xmath0-wave singlet with the odd - frequency triplet component under applied uniform magnetic fields through zeeman splitting of the conduction band@xcite .",
    "such a situation may also be relevant to superconductivity coexisting with ferromagnetism@xcite .",
    "when the odd - frequency component is involved , a delicate treatment of the superconducting state should be required .",
    "namely , in describing a superconducting state , there exist two independent gap functions , @xmath2 and its particle - hole converted counterpart @xmath3 , which are usually considered as hermite conjugate pairs .",
    "however , it has been argued that the relation between them is nontrivial in the case of the odd - frequency pairing@xcite .",
    "a guiding principle of determining the relation between them is real and minimum condition of the free energy , and it is concluded that the correct choice is @xmath4@xcite , although it has long been believed @xmath5 in the case of the odd - frequency pairing .",
    "the latter relation was the main source of fatal deficiency of the bulk odd - frequency pairing , such as thermodynamic instability and unphysical negative meissner kernel in the superconducting phase@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we shall discuss in this paper that the above relation , @xmath4 , is no longer satisfied simultaneously for both components in a coexistence case of the even - frequency and the odd - frequency pairings@xcite .",
    "consequently , the _ majority _ component of them takes the ordinary sign , @xmath6 , while the _ minority _ component must have the _ opposite _ sign , @xmath5 , in order to gain interference energy between two components . as a result , it exhibits different behaviors in various physical quantities from those obtained by neglecting this minority component with the anomalous negative sign relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we discuss general structure of the free - energy functional in the coexistence case on the basis of the luttinger - ward functional theory . the real and minimum condition of the free energy requires the opposite sign relations for spin singlet and triplet components . in  3 , we examine the @xmath0-wave singlet with the induced odd - frequency triplet under the applied magnetic fields , based on the ordinary electron - phonon model with a single einstein frequency .",
    "the anomalous feature of the free - energy functional is demonstrated in the strong - coupling limit with single gap approximation .",
    "we show the comparisons of the specific heat and the superfluid density with or without the odd - frequency component by solving the full eliashberg equations .",

    "the closed square represents the minimum of @xmath195 in the case of @xmath108 . by the comparison between figs .",
    "[ fmapl ] and [ g_gap ] , we can see that both the normal and the superconducting states are characterized by the _ saddle points _ of the _ constrained _ free - energy functional with the choice of @xmath107 .",
    "note that an arbitrary initial condition always converges to the solution of the eliashberg equations that corresponds to the saddle point of the constrained free - energy functional in the case of @xmath107 . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath108 ,",
    "the energy of the saddle point is always higher than that of the origin in the constrained free - energy functional , which corresponds to the normal state .",
    "this is the consequence of the wrong choice of @xmath106 .",
    "let us now discuss some physical quantities by solving the full eliashberg equations , ( [ eeqs ] ) , and compare with those obtained by neglecting the odd - frequency component ( @xmath196 is forced to be zero during the computation ) , which corresponds to the limit of vanishing attraction in the triplet channels .",
    "figure  [ g_ct ] shows the comparison of the specific heat @xmath197 and the entropy difference @xmath198 from the normal state . here , @xmath199 is the renormalized sommerfeld coefficient in the normal state .",
    "although @xmath164 is considerably different from each other , the discontinuities at @xmath1 show almost no difference ( @xmath200 ) and the slopes of @xmath197 below @xmath1 differ slightly from each other .",
    "namely , the entropy release in the mixed - frequency solution is more gradual than that in the pure singlet solution .",
    "note that the correct mixed - frequency solution has lower entropy than that of the pure singlet solution .",
    "the comparison of the superfluid density @xmath201 is shown in fig .",
    "the evolutions of @xmath201 near @xmath1 are linear in both cases , but the slope of the mixed - frequency solution is slightly smaller than that of the pure singlet solution . in low enough temperatures , however , the superfluid density of the mixed - frequency solution is larger than that of the pure singlet solution",
    ". this behavior can be interpreted by a paramagnetic contribution from the induced odd - frequency component in the vicinity of @xmath1 , which suppresses the meissner screening slightly .",
    "the majority singlet component gives the ordinary diamagnetic meissner current , which eventually dominates over the paramagnetic contribution from the induced odd - frequency component at low temperatures .",

    "we have investigated general structure of the free - energy functional for the coexistence state of the singlet and triplet pairings with the even - odd - frequency mixing .",
    "the real condition of the free - energy functional for the coexistence state requires the relation between the gap functions and their particle - hole converted counterparts as , @xmath202 where @xmath106 takes either @xmath87 or @xmath88 depending on which component is majority , i.e. , @xmath107 for the singlet majority and @xmath108 for the triplet majority , in order to lower the resultant equilibrium free energy via the interference effect . in the pure singlet or the triplet state",
    ", this requirement reduces to the ordinary relations@xcite , @xmath203 or @xmath204 .",
    "the opposite signs in the singlet and the triplet channels lead to the anomalous structure of the free - energy functional , which is constrained by the above relations , and the equilibrium normal and superconducting states are characterized not by the minimum , but by the saddle point of the constrained free - energy functional .",
    "the minority component with the extraordinary relation , @xmath205 suppresses the superconducting state yielding lower @xmath1 as compared with those obtained by neglecting the minority component .",
    "it also reflects in property of various physical quantities such as the specific heat and the superfluid density .    using the simplest example of the ordinary @xmath0-wave singlet state mixed with the triplet state with the odd - frequency dependence under magnetic fields",
    ", we have demonstrated the saddle - point structure of the constrained free - energy functional , and the induced odd - frequency triplet component ( the minority component with the opposite sign ) alters the @xmath10 dependences of the specific heat and the superfluid density as compared with those obtained by neglecting the odd - frequency triplet component .",
