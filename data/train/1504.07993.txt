    "topological solid states of matter @xcite have the property that their bulk states are gapped , while states at the boundaries are gapless and protected by some discrete quantum symmetry .",
    "the topological aspect emerges when considering the transport properties of the boundary states , where the transport current happens to also be a topological current .",
    "the most well established topological solid states of matter are topological insulators ( tis ) , which are gapped in the bulk and have helical ( or chiral ) gapless states at the boundaries which are protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "helical here means that the electronic spin is locked to momentum due to strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "thus , the boundary states have an helicity determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath1 at each boundary .",
    "topological insulators have been predicted to exist @xcite and confirmed experimentally in subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "although many of the materials investigated experimentally are not perfect insulators in the bulk , the observed boundary helical states are robust features of these materials .",
    "there exists another predicted topological solid state of matter , namely topological superconductors ( tscs ) @xcite , where the experimental situation is less clear .",
    "tscs follow a symmetry classification scheme closely related to tis , as far as hamiltonians of the bogoliubov - de gennes type are concerned.@xcite just like tis , tscs have gapped states in the bulk and symmetry - protected gapless states at the boundaries .",
    "unlike tis , in tscs the @xmath2 symmetry is broken , either spontaneously or by proximity effect .",
    "the gapless boundary states are majorana fermions , which are fermionic particles that are their own anti - particles . in order to support such states at the boundaries ,",
    "the topological superconductivity must feature a @xmath3-wave type of gap .",
    "particle - hole is the underlying symmetry protecting the boundary majorana states . in one dimension ,",
    "a paradigmatic simple model for topological superconductivity has been proposed by kitaev @xcite where the majorana zero - energy states live at the ends of a quantum wire .",
    "an experimental way of realizing a superconducting state in a quantum wire is by proximity effect . in this case",
    "a semiconducting wire with strong spin - orbit coupling is deposited on the surface of an @xmath4-wave superconductor in the presence of an external perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "then by proximity effect @xmath3-wave like superconductivity is induced on the wire for a certain range of parameters.@xcite there are some experimental signatures of majorana modes in indium antimonide nanowires in contact with normal and superconducting electrodes.@xcite more recently , strong support for majorana boundary zero modes have been reported in an experiment with a ferromagnetic chain of iron fabricated on the surface of lead.@xcite    three - dimensional ( 3d ) tscs have also been discussed theoretically , in particular focusing on vortex physics @xcite and possible topological phase transitions.@xcite a distinctive feature of both three - dimensional tis and tscs with respect to their non - topological counterparts is the topological magnetoelectric response induced by a mechanism similar to the so - called chiral anomaly.@xcite when fermions in topological materials interact with the electromagnetic field , a berry phase mixing electric and magnetic fields is induced.@xcite in tis this occurs due to strong spin - orbit coupling that locks spin to momentum .",
    "the resulting berry phases combine in the form of a so - called axion term , which is a magnetoelectric term @xmath5 with a periodic field , @xmath6 , appearing as a coefficient.@xcite this coefficient corresponds to a topological invariant implied by the chern number of the band structure .",
    "if tr symmetry is preserved , there are only two possible values for @xmath6 in a 3d insulator , namely , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the former value corresponding to a topologically trivial insulator.@xcite in the case of tscs a topological magnetoelectric contribution also arises , but now @xmath6 corresponds to the phase difference between order parameters of opposite chirality.@xcite recently , axionic superconductivity has been also discussed in the context of doped narrow - gap semiconductors.@xcite    the 3d tsc constructed by qi _",
    "@xcite should actually correspond to an interacting topological state of matter , going beyond the the symmetry classification of topological non - interacting theories for insulators and superconductors.@xcite according to the standard symmetry classification and an argument following from the gravitational anomaly,@xcite 3d tscs having tr invariance are classified by an integer topological invariant , belonging to the diii class in the free fermion classification table.@xcite thus , unlike tr invariant tis , the electromagnetic axionic response of 3d tscs would involve an axion field having values @xmath7 or @xmath8 , mod @xmath9 . however , as pointed out in ref .",
    ", the axion in tscs is a dynamical phase variable associated with the superconducting order parameter , or higgs field in the language of quantum field theory .",
    "furthermore , the meissner effect gives a mass to the photon via the higgs mechanism .",
    "this is an important difference with respect to the axion electrodynamics of tis , where no u(1 ) symmetry is broken and the gauge field remains gapless .",
    "furthermore , nontrivial chern numbers are associated with the different phases . for the simpler case featuring two weyl fermions with opposite helicity",
    ", we have opposite chern numbers , leading to a topological invariant given by the sign of the gap amplitude.@xcite thus , the arguments in ref . seems to point out to a @xmath10 classification .",
    "however , since the relevant symmetry in the problem is @xmath11 , it has been shown recently @xcite that in topological superconductors with tr symmetry the @xmath12 classification is reduced to @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the higgs mechanism and anomalous hall effect of three - dimensional tscs within the model introduced recently in ref . .",
    "in the simplest case , the model features two superconducting order parameters associated with left and right fermion chiralities interacting with the electromagnetic field , and a topological magnetoelectric term .",
    "we will show that quantum fluctuations in such a sc imply an interacting topologically non - trivial phase that can not be continuously deformed into the interacting topologically trivial one .",
    "our claim is substantiated by a renormalization group analysis .",
    "this result does not follow from the classical lagrangian of the system derived earlier in ref .",
    ", and is a purely quantum effect involving the interaction between photons and higgs fields . we show that due to this behavior , the type i regime of the tsc features a first - order phase transition in the bulk and a second - order phase transition on the surface .",
    "this distinguishes a tsc from a topologically trivial superconductor in the type i regime .",
    "the latter would exhibit a first - order phase transition in the bulk as well as on the surface , provided quantum fluctuations are accounted for @xcite ( this point will be discussed in detail in section iii ) .",
    "another consequence of the topological magnetoelectric term is the occurrence of an anomalous hall effect when an electric field is applied parallel to the surface of a tsc . due to the magnetoelectric effect",
    ", a transverse current is generated from a lorentz - like force involving the relative superfluid velocity @xmath14 and the applied electric field .",
    "the generated transverse current is negative , a situation reminiscent of the anomalous hall effect in superconductors @xcite , and observed high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors.@xcite however , in the latter case the anomalous hall effect occurs due to vortex motion induced by the faraday law , and is typically a very small effect .",
    "furthermore , in this case the lorentz force acts directly on the vortex core , and therefore on the normal components of the superconductor .",
    "for this reason , it automatically leads to dissipation . in the case of three - dimensional tscs ,",
    "on the other hand , the anomalous hall effect occurs even in absence of vortices and is induced solely by an external electric field via the magnetoelectric effect .",
    "dissipationless anomalous hall current is generated on the surface_.    the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "in section ii we discuss how the higgs mechanism works in a topological superconductor .",
    "we will show that after the phases are integrated out , interactions between the photons automatically arise due to the axion term .",
    "this is in contrast to the ordinary higg mechanism , where the phases can be trivially integrated out by a gauge transformation . in section iii",
    "we discuss the role of quantum fluctuations and derive the effective potential on the surface and the renormalization group ( rg ) equations .",
    "we show that the rg equations of the topological superconductor can not be connected to the ones of a topologically trivial superconductor .",
    "this is shown to occur as a direct consequence of the axion term . finally , in section iv we discuss the dissipationless variant of the anomalous hall effect using the london limit of topological superconductors .",
    "the effective lagrangian for a three - dimensional tsc featuring two fermi surfaces is given by @xcite , @xmath15\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{u}{2}(|\\phi_l|^2+|\\phi_r|^2)^2 + 2j(\\phi_l^*\\phi_r+\\phi_r^*\\phi_l),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the charge of the condensate .",
    "the greek indices run from 0 to 3 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq : l - higgs ] ) corresponds to an abelian higgs model with a two - component scalar field @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denote `` right '' and `` left '' chiralities of the two components of the scalar condensate matter field , minimally coupled to the gauge - field @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast to the standard higgs model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : l - higgs ] ) features a so - called axion term @xcite , which is the first term appearing in the lagrangian above .",
    "the term is topological in nature and contains a scalar field ( the axion ) @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the phases of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , i.e. @xmath27 . in terms of electric and magnetic field components ,",
    "the toplogical term reads @xmath28 , which is precisely the magnetoelectric form mentioned in the introductory paragraphs .",
    "a josephson coupling term @xmath29 accounts for the interference between the two superconducting order parameter fields .",
    "this is a characteristic feature in superconductors with two or more components of the order parameter , and is absent only if prohibited by symmetries of the problem .",
    "@xcite below , we show that the josephson coupling is generated by fluctuations , and therefore it is legitimate to include such a term from the very beginning in the lagrangian .",
    "furthermore , the josephson coupling is important for tuning between topologically trivial and nontrivial phases .",
    "in fact , a simple mean - field analysis shows that for @xmath30 the josephson coupling implies @xmath7 , yielding a topologically trivial superconductor . for @xmath31 ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath6 is locked to @xmath8 , thus leading to a topologically non - trivial superconducting ground state .",
    "since @xmath6 is periodic , @xmath32 corresponds to a situation where the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry is preserved @xcite .",
    "thus , at the mean - field level , @xmath33 separates a topologically trivial ground state from a non - trivial one .",
    "thus , varying @xmath34 from positive to negative values induces a topological quantum phase transition",
    ".    in the @xmath2 higgs mechanism the phases disappear from the spectrum due to spontaneous breaking of the local @xmath2 symmetry , being transmuted into the longitudinal mode for the photon , which becomes gapped .",
    "thus , only amplitude modes remain in the spectrum of scalar particles .",
    "the higgs mechanism is equivalent to integrating out the phase degrees of freedom , which in the case of the higgs model automatically leads to a massive gauge particle .",
    "this point of view of integrating out the phases is particularly appealing in the case where a josephson coupling is present .",
    "however , additional non - linearities arise in the presence of the axion term . to see this ,",
    "let us first consider the higgs mechanism in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l - higgs ] ) for the case where the axion term is absent . in this case",
    "we can simply write @xmath35 , @xmath36 and make the shift , @xmath37 which yields , @xmath38 note that in absence of the axion term and for the particular situation of a single scalar field component , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the above effective lagrangian trivially reduces to the usual lagrangian for the higgs model in the unitary gauge . in this particular case",
    "the lagrangian is independent of the phase . for the case relevant to us here ,",
    "where two scalar fields are present , there is a term @xmath41 remaining .",
    "thus , in the absence of josephson coupling there is still a massless ( goldstone ) mode present in the spectrum .",
    "this occurs because there are two higgs fields and one abelian gauge field .",
    "thus , it is only possible to gauge away one phase degree of freedom .",
    "the phase @xmath6 would not couple directly to the gauge field in the absence of the axion term . due to the axion term , integrating out the phases generate direct interactions between photons , even if the amplitudes are assumed to be uniform .",
    "for the topological phase of the system occurring for @xmath31 , we have to integrate out the lowest order gaussian phase fluctuations around @xmath32 . in general",
    ", this renders the induced photon - photon interaction being non - local .",
    "if the amplitudes are uniform , we obtain the effective lagrangian , @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath44 . in the long wavelength regime",
    "the induced photon interaction is strongly screened by the axion .",
    "hence , we have @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting photon - photon interaction simplifies and we obtain@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "we now turn to a crucial aspect of the topological phase with respect to the surface states .",
    "it turns out that in the presence of quantum fluctuations , the topological surface states can not be continuously deformed into topologically trivial ones in the long wavelength limit when crossing the critical point . to see , this let us assume that @xmath6 is uniform on the surfaces , with @xmath32 for the tr invariant case .",
    "note that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are still allowed to fluctuate , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath50 , each surface contains a chern - simons ( cs ) term.@xcite thus , assuming two surfaces perpendicular to the @xmath51-axis , we find that the imaginary time photon propagator at any surface is given by @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the @xmath56 sign is chosen depending on which surface one is referring to . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : photon - prop ] ) the transverse gauge has been fixed . at the phase transition to the normal state",
    "where @xmath57 , the feynman diagram shown in fig .",

    "namely , for all @xmath59 we have , @xmath60 whereas the result is divergent for @xmath7 .",
    "thus , after other one - loop scattering amplitudes are taken into account to obtain the full four - higgs vertex , we see that at the critical point the topological field theory can not be continuously deformed into a topologically trivial one .",
    "this statement holds trivially for topological bogoliubov - de gennes superconductors . here",
    ", we have shown that it also holds in the presence of quantum fluctuations in an interacting system , beyond the bogoliubov - de gennes picture .",
    "this occurs because the photon is topologically gapped , despite the vanishing of the meissner gap ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "note that this result is due to the topological character of the axion term , and not due to a symmetry protection .",
    "indeed , since the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : fish ] vanishes for any @xmath59 , tr invariance is not required .",
    "thus , in this context the topologically non - trivial phase simply corresponds to the case where the axion term is nonzero .",
    "a continuous deformation to the topologically trivial phase can be done in the higgs phase , where there are no gapless modes . at the critical point",
    "such a continuous deformation is not possible .",
    "thus , quantum critical fluctuations in this system will govern topologically stable universal behavior in physical quantities .",
    "this has important implications for critical exponents and amplitude ratios . indeed , as we will see , the vanishing of the diagram shown in fig .",

    "that for a large enough cs coupling ( i.e. , @xmath110 in our notation ) , the first - order phase transition is turned into a second - order one . regarding the result in the london limit without cs term , we note that our analysis in this section is being done in the type i regime , since amplitude fluctuations play an important role in the calculations above . indeed , the theory with @xmath111 yields a fluctuation induced first - order phase transition .",

    "second , and most importantly , the phase transition in the bulk is always a first - order one , while a second - order phase transition is possible on the surface .",
    "this is not the case for the topologically trivial superconductor , where a second - order phase transition on the surface is only obtained for sufficiently large @xmath126 .",
    "we next turn to the meissner effect aspects of a tsc , which as we will now show , implies an anomalous hall effect even in the absence of vortices .",
    "this is more conveniently done by rewriting the lagrangian in a london limit exhibiting explicitly electric and magnetic fields , i.e. , @xmath145 from the effective lagrangian we obtain that the electric displacement and magnetic fields are given respectively by @xmath146 and @xmath147 , while the superconducting current is given by , @xmath148.\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) we obtain the usual london equation in absence of vortices , @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the square of the penetration depth .",
    "thus , the maxwell equation in the presence of the axion field , @xmath151 yields the equation determining the london electrodynamics of the tsc in the form , @xmath152.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the axion field we obtain the equation of motion , @xmath153    in the low frequency regime and in absence of vortices , the london equation ( [ eq : london ] ) simplifies to , @xmath154,\\ ] ] while the current satisfies , @xmath155 the london equation for the electric field is unaffected by the axion term , retaining its traditional form , @xmath156 .",
    "this result is closely related to the fact that the electromagnetic energy density does not contain a magnetolectric term .",
    "we now consider a solution with a simple geometry , namely , a semi - infinite tsc ( @xmath157 ) with a surface at @xmath158 at an external electric field @xmath159 parallel to the surface .",
    "we obtain , @xmath160 where @xmath161 , and @xmath162,\\ ] ] @xmath163 the solution for eq .",

    "thus , we find that the usual boundary condition of the london theory , @xmath169 , is obviously fulfilled by the solution ( [ eq : sol - jy ] ) in the presence of the axion field",
    ". however , the maxwell equation ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) in the static regime implies a boundary condition that deviates from the standard one in the london theory of non - topological superconductors , @xmath170 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sol - jy ] ) and ( [ eq : relation ] ) we see that an approximate solution can be obtained by considering terms proportional to @xmath171 as being of higher order , which amounts to approximating eq .",

    "we can use the domain wall solution @xmath172 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol - jy ] ) , which yields @xmath173 explicitly .",
    "the explicit solution for @xmath173 with @xmath174 in terms of hypergeometric and lerch transcedents , is not very illuminating .",

    "it has a negative sign , just like in the case of the anomalous hall effect in high-@xmath0 superconductors @xcite .",
    "as emphasized in the introductory paragraphs , the anomalous hall effect in non - topological superconductors has a quite different origin from the one discussed here .",

    "the normal state corresponds to @xmath183 , which yields @xmath184 , i. e. , the half - quantum of the quantized hall conductivity .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that due to quantum electromagnetic fluctuations , the higgs mechanism in three - dimensional tscs implies a robust topological state of matter , since its rg flow can not be continuously deformed into the rg flow of a topologically trivial one .",
    "this is an example of a topological state that is protected due to the coupling of phase and electromagnetic fluctuations via the axion term , with tr symmetry not being required .",
    "in fact , tr can be spontaneously broken by quantum fluctuations . in this context , we have also shown that a second - order quantum phase transition happens on the surface of a tsc , while its bulk undergoes a first - order phase transition . without the axion term a first - order phase transition would happen both in the bulk and on the surface ,",
    "provided the superconductor is in the type i regime .",
    "another aspect of the higgs mechanism we have studied is the influence of the axion term in the meissner effect .",
    "we have found that the gradient of the axion field on the surface induces a transverse supercurrent . in the low frequency limit",
    "this implies a london regime leading to the generation of an anomalous hall current with a negative sign .",
