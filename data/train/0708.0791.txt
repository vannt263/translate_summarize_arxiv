    "be / x - ray binaries show two types of x - ray outbursts which are regularly referred to as type i and type ii @xcite .",
    "type i outbursts are associated with the time of periastron passage as the neutron star passes closest to the be donor .",

    "type ii outbursts can occur at any phase of the orbit , they have x - ray luminosities of @xmath8ergs  s@xmath3 and they can last for several weeks @xcite .",
    "a0535 + 262 was discovered by ariel v during a large type ii outburst in 1975 @xcite . since then",
    "the source has been observed to undergo numerous outbursts , however there were no reported detections of x - ray outburst activity from 19942005 @xcite .",
    "the source reappeared in a type ii outburst in may / june 2005 and was detected by swift @xcite and rhessi @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently seen to undergo a type i outburst in august 2005 @xcite .",
    "the orbital parameters of the system were first determined by @xcite following the 1994 outburst :    * p@xmath9  =  110.3  @xmath5  0.3 days * a@xmath10@xmath11  =  267  @xmath5  13 lt - sec * _ e _  =  0.47  @xmath5",

    "a distance to the source of 2  kpc was estimated by @xcite through the observation of the spectral type and the reddening of the optical counterpart of a0535 + 262 .",
    "a number of observations have been made of a0535 + 262 whilst it is in the quiescent phase .",
    "exosat observations were made in 19851986 between outbursts by @xcite ; pulsations were detected and a luminosity of 0.71.4  @xmath1  @xmath2  ergs  s@xmath3 for a source at 2 kpc was measured . during the 19942005 quiescent phase the system was observed by the rxte - pca instrument in 1998 and by bepposax in 2000 @xcite ; both telescopes reported luminosities of @xmath01.54.5  @xmath1  @xmath14  ergs  s@xmath3 which indicated the system was in the centrifugally inhibited regime despite both telescopes detecting pulsations in some of their observations . in this paper",
    "we present soft @xmath15-ray observations of a0535 + 262 during a flare whilst the source was in a quiescent state .",
    "a timing and spectral analysis is performed on the integral data and the results interpreted in the context of previous observations .",
    "the long term pulse history of the source is discussed .",
    "since its launch in october 2002 , integral ( the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ) has been performing regular scans of the galactic plane .",
    "the ibis imaging instrument is sensitive in the 15 kev  10 mev energy range @xcite and includes the integral soft gamma - ray imager ( isgri ) .",
    "recently , the ibis survey team released the 3@xmath16 ibis / isgri soft @xmath15-ray survey catalogue comprising 40 ms of data from the first 3.5 years of core and public program observations @xcite . included in this catalogue was the first announced detection of a0535 + 262 by the ibis survey team ; they observed that it was seen at 9.4  @xmath17 in their all - sky mosaic with an average flux of 3.0  @xmath5  0.3 mcrab in the 2040 kev energy band and an exposure of @xmath0400 ks .",

    "is known to be a transient source we searched back through the integral data archive to identify any outbursts in the catalogue 3 data set .",
    "the integral data is organised in short pointings , known as science windows , of approximately 2000s .",
    "the source was only significantly detected in 3 science windows during integral orbit number 127 ; this corresponds to the source being detected on 28 october 2003 from 09:45:10 to 12:39:54 utc .",
    "prior and post to this the source was outside of the field of view of the telescope . during the observation and afterwards there was increased solar activity ; an x17 solar flare on october 28 and an x10 flare on october 29 @xcite .",
    "the flare on october 28 2003 began at 09:41 ut , was at maximum at 11:10 ut and ended at around 11:24 ut ; spi , the spectrometer onboard integral , showed a strong increase in counting rate at @xmath011:02 @xcite .",

    "is shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "it is clear that the quality of the data during the latter half of the observation has been compromised by the increased background resulting from the solar flare activity .",
    "this is also evident in the increasing amount of instrument dead time throughout the observation .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] does not show any general trend with time such that there is no indication whether the source is beginning or ending an outburst .",
    "the lack of data prior to and post of the observation means that we can not place any real limits on the outburst duration .",

    "the sparsity of the asm data around the integral observation is potentially due to the high solar activity .",

    "a spectrum was extracted from the ibis / isgri data .",
    "unfortunately , a0535 + 262 was outside of the field of view of the integral x - ray monitor , jem - x , and hence only the ibis / isgri spectrum was available for analysis .",
    "the 18 - 100 kev ibis / isgri spectum was fit using the _ xspec _ software , version 12.3 , a systematic error of 2% was included .",
    "the best fit was obtained by an absorbed thermal bremmstrahlung model ( @xmath19  =  1.17 ) with kt=23@xmath20 kev ( see figure  [ fig : spec ] ) , however an absorbed simple power law provided a reasonable fit ( @xmath19  =  1.24 ) . in both cases",

    "it had been believed that the a0535 + 262 system had been in a period of inactivity for the 10 years prior to the 2005 outburst @xcite . in the 19942005 period",
    "a number of x - ray observations were made of the system whilst it was in quiescence .",
    "these include the observations made by the rxte - pca instrument in august and november 1998 which detected the source at a luminosity of 2.04.5  @xmath1  10@xmath24ergs s@xmath3 @xcite .",

    "observations by bepposax in september and october 2000 and march 2001 also observed the source during a state of very low luminosity , 1.54.0  @xmath1  10@xmath24ergs s@xmath3 and again detected pulsations @xcite .    despite a significant level of exposure on this region of the sky , @xmath0400 ks , ibis /",
    "isgri only detects a0535 + 262 on one occasion for a duration of @xmath06 ks at a level of @xmath062 mcrab in the 2040 kev energy band ; this indicates that ibis / isgri observed some level of flaring behaviour .",
    "no other x - ray instrument reports a detection at this time , however , this may be attributable to the high level of solar activity which occurred .",
    "the time of the ibis / isgri detection corresponds to a phase of 0.81  @xmath5  0.07 using the ephermeris of @xcite and orbital period of @xcite ; this is @xmath021 days prior to periastron and is somewhat early to be a type i outburst .",
    "however , the calculated phase is within 3@xmath17 of periastron and be x - ray binary systems have been known to undergo type i outbursts prior to and post periastron .",
    "exo 2030 + 375 , for example , has been seen to outburst between 4 days prior to and 6 days post periastron ( phase 0.91 and 0.09 respectively ) in its @xmath046 day orbit @xcite .",
    "this shift is explained by a density perturbation in the be star s equatorial disk .",
    "@xcite show that the h@xmath25 profiles of a0535 + 262 in dec 2002 and mar 2005 exhibit some asymmetry in the double peaked structure which may indicate a density perturbation in the be disk ; density perturbations in the disk of a0535 + 262 have previously been reported by @xcite .",
    "however , in 2003 at the time of the integral observation , @xcite estimate the be disk size to be at the 7:1 resonance radius of the model of @xcite . for a type i outburst to occur the neutron star must accrete matter through roche lobe overflow ,",
    "this is possible when the circumstellar disk reaches the 4:1 resonance radius , which in the case of a0535 + 262 did not happen until early 2005 @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the activity observed by ibis occurs each periastron passage and that it has not previously been noticed because it is short lived and requires a high sensitivity instrument to be be looking at it .",
    "looking through the integral archive we note that a0535 + 262 has been observed on numerous other occassions by integral between 2003 and 2005 and in two additional instances the pointings coincided with a periastron passage , however in neither of these instances was a significant detection of a0535 + 262 made by integral .",
    "analysis of the rxte all sky monitor ( asm ) x - ray data during 10 years of quiescence of a0535 + 262 by @xcite find a modulation in the x - ray flux on the orbital period with maximum flux at periastron .",
    "the flux of the source is measured as 7.9  @xmath1  @xmath23ergs  @xmath22  s@xmath3 in the 18100 kev band . taking a distance of 2",
    "kpc @xcite implies a luminosity of @xmath03.8  @xmath1  @xmath2ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "this luminosity is at the lower end of what could be expected of a type i outburst which have typical luminosities of @xmath010@xmath26ergs  s@xmath3 and is vastly under - luminous for a type ii outburst which is typically in excess of 10@xmath27ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "earlier estimates of the source distance range from 1.3 to 2.4 kpc @xcite ; within this range the source is still underluminous for either type i or type ii bursts .",
    "additionally , type ii outbursts typically last for approximately a month , consequently we would expect detections by other instruments despite the high solar activity if this were an example of a type ii outburst . whilst the luminosity of the source is compatible with a type i outburst the time of outburst does not correspond to the periastron passage .",
    "as discussed above this may suggest that the source activity is not attributable to a type i outburst .",
    "we suggest that the integral detection may have been a brief flare during the quiescent phase .",
    "this could potentially have been triggered by an increased density of the material thrown out by the stellar wind of the be star .",
    "assuming an efficiency @xmath28=1 in the conversion of gravitational energy into luminosity then we can calculate the mass accretion rate : @xmath29 the magnetic field strength of the neutron star in a0535 + 262 is @xmath04  @xmath1  10@xmath13 gauss @xcite .",
    "for the known magnetic field strength , the mass accretion rate and the spin period of the pulsar the corotation radius is estimated using the formulation of @xcite @xmath30 and the magnetospheric radius is estimated using the formulation of @xcite @xmath31 the corotation radius defines the distance at which the neutron star rotation velocity is equal to the keplerian velocity .",
    "the magnetospheric radius defines the region in which the magnetic field strongly effects the dynamical properties of infalling material .",
    "if the magnetospheric radius is larger than the corotation radius material is then accreted material is stopped at the magntospheric boundary and may be ejected beyond the accretion radius via the propeller effect ; this is known as the centrifugal inhibition regime .",
    "as r@xmath32 r@xmath33 the pulsar can be expected to be outside the centrifugally inhibited regime and consequently should exhibit x - ray pulsations .",
    "however , our estimates of the magnetospheric and corotation radii are within a factor of two indicating that the source may have recently transitioned from the centrifugally inhibited regime",
    ". however , there are a number of uncertainties in the calculation of the magnetospheric radius ; a larger distance or an @xmath341 would imply a higher mass accretion rate and reduce the estimate of r@xmath35 as would a lower magnetic field strength .",
    "ibis / isgri clearly measures the spin period of the pulsar in the a0535 + 262 system as 103.7  @xmath5  0.1 seconds .",
    "if we add this to previous measurements of the spin period of the pulsar we see the long term pulse period history shown in figure  [ fig : pp_hist ] .",
    "it is clear that since the batse observations of @xcite the pulsar underwent a period of consistent spin - down , slowing from @xmath0103.2 seconds to @xmath0103.7 seconds by the ibis / isgri measurement in 2003 . based upon these measurements we estimate a spin - down rate of @xmath36  @xmath0  1.5  @xmath1  10@xmath37  s  s@xmath3 .",
    "spin - down is to be expected as the system has been in a period of inactivity with no reported x - ray outbursts from 1994 - 2005 ; the lack of x - ray activity implies that no substantial accretion disk has formed around the pulsar to provide any accretion torques to spin - up the pulsar . the type ii outburst in",
    "may / june 2005 followed by the type i outburst in august / september 2005 spin the pulsar up to a period of p  =  103.39315  @xmath5  0.00005  s @xcite .    from the magnetic field strength we calculate the expected spin - down through magnetic dipole losses as 9.4  @xmath1  10@xmath38s  s@xmath3 ,",
    "this is many orders of magntitude less than the observed spin - down and hence can not be the cause of the change in the pulsar period .",
    "additionally , the spin - down is of too high a magnitude to be explained by the ejection of matter by the neutron star .",
    "consquently , the spin - down of the pulsar must be the result of torques imparted from an accretion disk around the neutron star ; this implies that the existence of a disk around the neutron star is not restricted to periods immediately surrounding type i or type ii outbursts .",
    "the results presented here examine the high energy emission from a0535 + 262 during a period in which the source was believed to be quiescent .",
    "the source is observed to be transient in the 18100 kev energy band by integral .",
    "the source luminosity is completely incompatible with type ii outbursting behaviour , is at the low end for a type i outburst and is at the high end for quiescent emission .",
    "the outburst occurs @xmath021 days prior to periastron .",
    "although it may be a type i outburst we examine the possibilty that the source activity is attributable to a flare during the quiescent phase .",
    "@xcite report that during the flare the be star circumstellar disk was not of sufficent size to support a type i outburst .",
    "the flaring nature of the source may be attributable to a brief period of increased mass transfer .",
    "we suggest that this increased mass transfer could originate in a period of increased stellar wind density from the be donor star although a low level type i outburst can not be completely ruled out .",
    "measurements of the spin period of the pulsar indicate that the source has continued the spin - down trend which has been observed in the source since it entered the quiescent phase in 1994 .",
    "a pulse period of 103.7  @xmath5  0.1 seconds is longer than any other period estimates made since 1994 and suggests a continuous process of spin - down at a rate of @xmath36  @xmath01.5  @xmath1  10@xmath37  s  s@xmath3 .",
    "such a level of spin - down can only be achieved through torquing drag processes which implies the regular presence of a residual accretion disk around the pulsar .",
    "a0535 + 262 is a well observed system during periods of typical type i and type ii outbursts , however few measurements have been made of it during its quiescent phases .",
    "the integral observations imply that during the quiescent phase this system remains active and , by the nature of the detection , is highly variable . extrapolating the ibis / isgri spectrum using the heasarc _ webpimms _ tool estimates that the count rate in the rxte - asm would have been @xmath02.4 counts s@xmath3",
    "had it observed the source .",
    "however , examining the asm observations of a0535 + 262 in the week before and after the integral observations indicate that the light curve had a mean of 0.75 and a standard deviation of 2.4 counts s@xmath3 .",
    "consequently , it is unlikely that had the asm observed a0525 + 262 at the time of the flare the instrument sensitivity would have been sufficient to identify the activity .",
    "based on observations with integral , an esa project with instruments and science data centre funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : denmark , france , germany , italy , switzerland , spain ) , czech republic and poland , and with the participation of russia and the usa ."
