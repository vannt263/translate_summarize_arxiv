    "the solution of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation with periodic potentials is important due to the possibility of finding interesting models which could be used in physics .",
    "this kind of potentials admits a spectrum composed of allowed energy bands , in which the physical eigenfunctions are bounded , separated by energy gaps , where the eigenfunctions are unbounded and thus they can not have physical meaning due to their exponential growing when we move far away from a given position .    of special interest",
    "are the so - called exactly solvable problems which , unfortunately , in the periodic case include very few potentials , e.g. , lam and some others . to be precise , by exact solvability we mean that for the corresponding potential it is possible to determine analytically the physical eigenfunctions for energies in the allowed bands ( the edges included ) , as well as the non - physical solutions for energies in the gaps .",
    "it is important to notice that in the direct spectral problems the unphysical solutions are neglected because they are apparently useless .",
    "however , in the inverse spectral problems , which somehow include the supersymmetric quantum mechanics as a particular case @xcite , they can be used as seeds to generate exactly solvable potentials from a given initial one @xcite .    in recent times",
    "it has been realized that the associated lam potentials , which include in particular the lam case , admit explicit expressions for the band edge eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to explore if those potentials are exactly solvable in the sense pointed above .",
    "if the answer turns out to be positive , then the band edge eigenfunctions as well as the non - physical solutions for the gaps can be used through supersymmetric quantum mechanics to generate new exactly solvable potentials , some of which could provide some interesting physical information .    in the next section we will consider some particular families of the associated lam potentials and show that they belong to the exactly solvable class .",
    "then , the formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics will be applied to generate new exactly solvable potentials .",

    "it is clear now that the differential equation ( [ aslw ] ) has regular singularities at the poles of @xmath15 and at points congruent to @xmath16 , the latter being absent in lam equation which corresponds to @xmath17 .",
    "our aim is to find two linearly independent solutions @xmath18 of eq .",

    "once we know the product of solutions , it is straightforward to obtain two linearly independent solutions for the associated lam equation ( [ asl ] ) following the same procedure adopted for lam @xcite . up to some constant factors ,",

    "it is not very difficult to check that both solutions ( [ gs1,1,1 ] ) become proportional to the three band edge eigenfunctions for the associated lam potentials with @xmath57 when @xmath1 takes the three eigenvalues @xmath58 , which is consistent with the fact that this potential has one finite energy band and one finite gap @xcite .",

    "in contrast , here we have proved that property by directly finding the general solution for arbitrary @xmath61 . on the other hand , up to constant factors both solutions ( [ gs2,1,1 ] ) reduce to the five band edge eigenfunctions for the associated lam potentials with @xmath62 when @xmath1 takes the five eigenvalues @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this is again consistent with the spectral properties for this associated lam potential which has two finite energy bands and two finite gaps . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "in the modern approach to the first - order supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) , in which a first order differential intertwining operator is used to implement the transformation , the seed schrdinger solution @xmath65 can be either physical or non - physical but it has to be nodeless to avoid singularities in the new potential @xmath66''$ ] ( see the collection of articles in @xcite ) .",
    "this is achieved by taking the factorization energy @xmath67 such that @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the lowest band edge energy . in particular ,",
    "if we chose @xmath65 as any of the two bloch functions @xmath70 derived in the previous section then @xmath71 will be periodic , with the same band spectrum as @xmath72 .",
    "on the other hand , if we choose @xmath65 as a nodeless linear combination of the two bloch functions @xmath70 associated to @xmath67 , then @xmath73 will present a periodicity defect , and the spectrum of @xmath74 will consist of the allowed energy bands of @xmath75 plus an isolated bound state at @xmath67 , for which the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath76 will be square - integrable @xcite .",
    "let us mention that for the second order susy qm , which involves differential intertwining operators of second order , the key function which has to be nodeless is the wronskian of the two seed solutions @xmath77 associated to the factorization energies @xmath78 @xcite . in this frame",
    "it is possible to use solutions for which @xmath78 have unexpected positions , e.g. , both can lie in a finite energy gap and produce however non - singular susy transformations . to be brief ,",
    "in this letter we will not apply the second order susy transformations and we will restrict our discussion to the first order cases mentioned above ( see however @xcite ) .    by applying now the first order susy algorithm to the associated lam potentials with @xmath34 and @xmath79 , using as seed solution any of the bloch functions given by eqs .",

    "if the seed solution is a linear combination of the two positive definite bloch functions , @xmath85 , then for @xmath86 , @xmath65 will have always a node , inducing then a singular susy transformation . for @xmath87 and @xmath88 we will recover once again the previously discussed case when @xmath65 is one of the bloch functions . finally , it is interesting to observe that for @xmath89 , @xmath65 will be nodeless , and the new potential will not be strictly periodic ( it will have a periodicity defect ) . the spectrum for",
    "the susy generated potential @xmath73 will consist of the allowed energy bands of the initial potential plus an isolated level embedded in the infinite region below the ` ground state energy ' of the initial potential .",
    "unfortunately , here the explicit expressions for @xmath73 are not compact .",
    "thus , we decided to illustrate this case graphically , and an example of the susy partner potential with one periodicity defect of the associated periodic lam potential for @xmath34 is given in fig .  1 while for @xmath79",
    "the corresponding susy partner potentials are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "through an appropriate ansatz , we have solved the stationary schrdinger equation for the associated lam potentials with an arbitrary energy corresponding to the parameter pairs @xmath32 and @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests that the associated lam equation with any integer values of the potential parameters is exactly solvable .",
    "this assertion can be proved case by case by appropriately modifying the ansatz , given by eqs .",
    "( [ ansz1]),([ansz2 ] ) and using a fitting procedure to find the corresponding analytic solution .",
    "for instance , one may fit the solution @xmath90^{r}$ ] to ( [ prod ] ) , which will effectively correspond to the point ( 3,2 ) in the @xmath30 plane , and so on .",
    "however , one of the aims of this paper was to show that this can be done through the simplest non - trivial available examples .",
    "on the other hand , the first order supersymmetry transformations were used to generate new exactly solvable potentials which can be either periodic or with a periodicity defect , depending on how we choose the seed schrdinger solutions .",
