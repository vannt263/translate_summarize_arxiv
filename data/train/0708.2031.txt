    "the possible existence of a large number of dark galaxies was suggested to reconcile the drastic difference between the predicted number density of low - mass cold dm halos and the observed number density of low - mass galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite the fact that the gap diminished significantly during the last years thanks to discovery of many very low - mass galaxies in the local group ( e.g. , moore , this meeting ) , it is still too large .",
    "the observational methods of searching for dark galaxies were discussed , e.g. , by @xcite .",
    "the range of global parameters , in which one expects the dark galaxies to exist , was explored in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite based on one of cdm models of disk galaxy formation by @xcite . while the predictions of the original version of @xcite work differed strongly from those of @xcite , the revised analysis by e.  taylor ( this meeting ) resulted in similar ranges of dark galaxy global parameters .",
    "there are a few dark galaxy candidates known to date .",
    "we summarize some of their observational parameters in table  [ tab : dark ] .",
    "three of these four objects were discussed during this symposium in the talks given by m.  haynes , j.  davies and e.  brinks .",
    "no optical counterparts were found for any of them .",
    "the upper limits on their central surface brightness ( sb ) are at the levels of 2727.5 @xmath1-mag sq.arcsec@xmath2 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , except hi j03253655 near fcc 35 , for which no optical counterpart is visible on the serc images ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distance - dependent parameters for hi 1225 + 01  sw are given for two possible distance extremes of 10 and 20 mpc .",
    "v@xmath3 is estimated either from the velocity fields , or from the maximal velocity widths .",
    "the first glimpse on the table reveals a rather large scatter of main parameters for these candidates .",
    "in addition , the new data presented at the symposium , suggests that hijass j1021 + 6824 along with many smaller hi features can have the tidal origin due to the strong interactions in m  81 group ( brinks , this meeting ) .",
    "moreover , according to the alfalfa hi map , virgohi  21 looks like a part of a long tail stretching from the massive spiral ngc  4254 ( r.  giovanelli , this meeting ) which is probably an evidence against its dark galaxy nature .    on the other hand",
    ", there are @xmath4cdm n - body simulations mentioned above , predicting the regions of the parametric space of baryon aggregates in which one can expect to find dark galaxies , defined as baryon `` disks '' inside dm halos with no stars formed so far .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to compare these predicted properties with those of `` dark galaxy '' candidates and of some their possible descendants .",
    "since as told in the introduction , both @xcite and taylor ( 2007 , this meeting ) give in general the consistent ranges of main parameters of dark galaxies , we base our further on the published results of @xcite .",
    "they can be summarized as follows .",
    "the total range of m(hi ) is of 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 , with only @xmath02% of simulated objects to have m(hi)=10@xmath8 - 10@xmath6  m@xmath7 .",
    "hi column densities vary in the range of ( 0.55)@xmath910@xmath10 at .",
    "the range of v@xmath3 is of 5 to 70 km  s@xmath12 , with less than @xmath01% to have v@xmath3 @xmath13 30 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the accepted baryon mass fraction ( m@xmath14/m@xmath15 ) according to theoretical expectations varies between 0.01 and 0.05 .",
    ".main parameters of candidate dark galaxies [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     o / h - in units 12+log(o / h ) from @xcite and @xcite , m(hi ) - in units 10@xmath8  m@xmath7 from @xcite , @xcite , and data in preparation , v@xmath3 in km  s@xmath12 , distance in mpc .",
    "v@xmath3 for sbs  0335052  e , w and ugc 772 are lower and m@xmath14/m@xmath15 are upper limits , since the inclination correction is uknown .",
    "summarising , we conclude that previous ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for i  zw  18 , sbs 0335052  e , w and ddo  68 ) and new ( ekta et al .",
    ". for ugc  772 and sdss j21340035 ) observational data indicate that starbursts in all the lowest metallicity ( o / h @xmath16 7.30 ) xmd bcgs , which are `` massive '' objects with m(gas ) of ( 2.612)@xmath910@xmath8 m@xmath7 , are related to mergers and strong interactions .",
    "their `` high '' baryon and total masses imply that the metal loss due to galactic winds does not affect their chemical evolution .",
    "therefore , their extremely low metallicities suggest that their progenitors are very stable and have produced very few stars / metals ( if any at all ) in previous epochs .",
    "hence , they should be either very low surface brightness galaxies or a kind of protogalaxies , which escaped strong external disturbance .",
    "if some of the xmd bcgs are indeed `` young '' , then dark galaxies are the natural candidates to be their progenitors",
    ". they could become `` visible '' due to recent strong interactions .",
    "it is evident that dark galaxies ( dg ) are treated as superstable against gas collapse only if taken as `` isolated '' objects ( e.i . when the external perturbations are smaller than internal ones ) .",
    "collisions of a fraction of dgs with galaxy - sized objects should affect their stability and induce the sinking of gas to their centers and its collapse .",
    "one can suggest three empirical levels of disturbance due to gravitational interaction : _ significant , strong _ and _ merger_. we call collision / interaction `` significant '' if it triggers gas collapse and sf and elevates the stellar mass and related ( central ) surface brightness above the `` threshold '' level , say of @xmath1726.5  @xmath18-mag  sq.arcsec@xmath2 , which is characteristic of the extremely lsb galaxies .",
    "how much such an object would resemble known elsbgs , depends on its sb radial profile .",
    "for the case of `` strong '' collision / interaction , dg will transform to an object with a more typical central sb , say with @xmath172325  @xmath18-mag  sq.arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "their resemblence to known lsbgs again depends on the resulting sb radial profile . in the case of a merger of a dg and another galaxy - sized aggregate",
    ", the results can be rather different depending on the type and mass of the said counterpart .",
    "such an event can be accompanied by a significant starburst and for some cases can look like a xmd bcg .",
    "it is interesting to note that result of `` significant '' interaction can be transient if a dg keeps its internal stability after the collision .",
    "after 0.51 gyr all massive and intermediate mass newly formed stars will die and the light of this `` elsb '' galaxy will fade below @xmath17 27.5  @xmath18-mag  sq.arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "the object again will be transformed to a dark galaxy .",
    "this discussion of various galaxies , which could be in principle related to a population of dark galaxies in the local universe , shows a serious need for numerical models of dark galaxy interactions .",
    "while the simulations of very gas - rich galaxy collisions have been difficult until recently due to the problem of proper accounting for various feedback processes , there has been significant progress made over the last two years . @xcite and @xcite presented n - body simulations of interacting gas - rich galaxies ( with 99% of baryons in gas ) which reproduce the formation of a disk galaxy in a major merger . up to now the models",
    "have dealt with rather massive objects .",
    "there is a need to extend them to the region of expected `` dark galaxy '' parametric space .",
    "this will allow one to better understand what emerges from their interactions : more or less `` typical '' lsbgs or something unusual .",
    "the models of `` dark galaxy '' mergers will elucidate whether some of xmd bcgs may be related to this process .    i would like to thank my collaborators a.  kniazev , a.  moiseev , j .-",
