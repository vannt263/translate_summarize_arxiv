    "we report here on an important step towards the ultimate goal of constructing numerical relativity codes that calculate accurately in 3d the gravitational radiation at future null infinity . by `` accurately ''",
    "we mean ( at least ) second - order convergent to the true analytic solution of a well posed initial value problem .",
    "thus our goal is to provide an accurate and unambiguous computational map from initial data to gravitational waveforms at infinity . of course",
    ", uncertainties will always exist in the appropriate initial data for any realistic astrophysical system ( e.g. in a binary neutron star system , the data for the metric components would not be uniquely determined by observations ) .",
    "but such a computational map enables focusing on the underlying physics in a rigorous way .",
    "most relativity codes are second - order convergent , but because of boundary problems the convergence may not be to the true analytic solution of the intended physical problem . in order to explain this point , and to give the idea behind our method , we first briefly review some aspects of numerical relativity . the predominant work in numerical relativity",
    "is for the cauchy `` 3 + 1 '' problem , in which spacetime is foliated into a sequence of spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "these hypersurfaces are necessarily of finite size so , in the usual case where space is infinite , an outer boundary with an artificial boundary condition must be introduced .",
    "this is the first source of error because of artificial effects such as the reflection of outgoing waves by the boundary .",
    "next , the gravitational radiation is estimated from its form inside the boundary by using perturbative methods , which ignore the nonlinear aspects of general relativity in the region outside the boundary .",
    "for these reasons the numerical estimate of gravitational radiation is not , in general , convergent to the true analytic value at future null infinity .",
    "the radiation properties of the robinson - trautman metric will be used to illustrate this effect .",
    "an alternative approach in numerical relativity uses the characteristic formalism , in which spacetime is foliated into a sequence of null cones emanating from a central geodesic .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the einstein equations can be compactified  @xcite so that future null infinity is rigorously represented on a finite grid , and there is no artificial outer boundary condition .",
    "however , it suffers from the disadvantage that the coordinates are based on light rays , which can be focussed by a strong field to form caustics which complicate a numerical computation  @xcite .",
    "also , to date , the characteristic initial value problem has only been implemented numerically for special symmetries  @xcite .",
    "our ultimate goal is a 3d cauchy - characteristic matching ( ccm ) code , which uses the positive features of the two methods while avoiding the problems .",
    "more precisely , the interior of a timelike worldtube @xmath0 is evolved by a cauchy method , and the exterior to future null infinity is evolved using a characteristic algorithm ; boundary conditions at @xmath0 are replaced by a two - way flow of information across @xmath0 . in relativity , under the assumption of axisymmetry without rotation ,",
    "there has been a feasibility study of ccm  @xcite ; see also  @xcite .",
    "ccm has been successfully implemented for nonlinear wave equations and demonstrated to be second - order convergent to the true analytic solution ( which is not true in a pure cauchy formulation with sommerfeld outer boundary condition )  @xcite .",
    "while ccm has aesthetic advantages , it is important to ask whether it is an efficient approach .",
    "the question can be posed as follows . for a given target error @xmath1 ,",
    "what is the amount of computation required for ccm compared to that required for a pure cauchy calculation ? it will be shown that the ratio tends to @xmath2 as @xmath3 , so that in the limit of high accuracy the effort is definitely worthwhile  @xcite .",
    "our first step towards ccm is cauchy - characteristic extraction ( cce ) and we will present a partial implementation of cce in this paper .",
    "the idea of cce is to run a pure cauchy evolution with an approximate outer boundary condition .",
    "a worldtube @xmath0 is defined in the interior of the cauchy domain , and the appropriate characteristic data is calculated on @xmath0 ; then characteristic algorithms are used to propagate this gravitational field to future null infinity  @xcite .",
    "cce is simpler than ccm to implement numerically , because in cce the data flow is one - way ( cauchy to characteristic ) whereas in ccm the data flows in both directions .",
    "note that the advantage of computational efficiency applies only to ccm and not to cce .",
    "however , we will show that the advantage of second - order convergence to the true analytic solution does apply , under certain circumstances , to cce .",
    "the work in this paper is part of the binary black hole grand challenge , which is concerned with the gravitational radiation resulting from the in - spiral and coalescence of two arbitrary black holes .",
    "however , the methods described here are not limited to black hole coalescence and could be applied to gravitational radiation from any isolated system , either with or without matter .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we present a formalism for 3d characteristic numerical relativity in which the coordinates are based on null cones that emanate from a timelike worldtube @xmath0 ( recall that existing codes are in 2d with null cones emanating from a timelike geodesic )  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic einstein equations are written as a sum of two parts : quasispherical ( in a sense defined below ) plus nonlinear .",
    "the discretization and compactification of the einstein equations , with the nonlinear part ignored , is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] . a computer code has been written and in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] this code is tested on linearized solutions of the einstein equations , and extraction is tested on the nonlinear robinson - trautman solutions .",
    "the robinson - trautman solutions are also used to investigate the error of perturbative methods in estimating the gravitational radiation at null infinity .",
    "[ sec:5 ] uses the formalism developed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] to estimate the errors associated with the finite boundary in a pure cauchy computation .",
    "this leads to the result concerning computational efficiency of ccm stated above .",
    "in the conclusion we discuss the further steps needed for a full implementation of cce , and also of ccm , and investigate under what circumstances cce can provide second - order convergence to the true analytic solution at future null infinity .",
    "we finish with appendices on the null cone version of gauge freedom and linear solutions of the einstein equations , and on a stability analysis of our algorithm .",
    "this is the first step towards a 3d characteristic evolution algorithm for the fully nonlinear vacuum einstein equations . here",
    "we treat the quasispherical case , where effects which are nonlinear in the asymmetry can be ignored .",
    "thus the schwarzschild metric is treated exactly in this formalism .",
    "however , rather than developing an algorithm for the linearized equations on a given schwarzschild background , we will approach this problem in a mathematically different way .",
    "we adopt a metric based approach in which each component of einstein s equation has ( i ) some quasispherical terms which survive in the case of spherical symmetry and ( ii ) other terms which are quadratic in the asymmetry , i.e terms of @xmath4 where @xmath5 measures deviation from spherical symmetry .",
    "we will treat the quasispherical terms to full nonlinear accuracy while discarding the quadratically asymmetric terms .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 were a scalar function we would make the approximation @xmath7    although this breakup is not unique , once made it serves two useful purposes .",
    "first , the resulting field equations are physically equivalent to the linearized einstein equations in the quasispherical regime .",
    "( in the exterior vacuum region , the spherical background must of course be geometrically schwarzschild but the quasispherical formalism maintains arbitrary gauge freedom in matching to an interior solution ) .",
    "second , the resulting quasispherical evolution algorithm supplies a building block which can be readily expanded into a fully nonlinear algorithm by simply inserting the quadratically asymmetric terms in the full einstein equations .",
    "we use coordinates based upon a family of outgoing null hypersurfaces .",
    "we let @xmath8 label these hypersurfaces , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , be labels for the null rays and @xmath11 be a surface area distance . in the resulting @xmath12 coordinates , the metric takes the bondi - sachs form  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a unit sphere metric . later , for purposes of including null infinity as a finite grid point , we introduce a compactified radial coordinate .",
    "a schwarzschild geometry is given by the choice @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . to describe a linear perturbation",
    ", we would set @xmath21 and would retain only terms in @xmath22 which were of leading order in the linearization parameter @xmath5 . here",
    "we take a different approach .",
    "we express @xmath23 in terms of a complex dyad @xmath24 ( satisfying @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 ) .",
    "then the dyad component @xmath29 is related to the linearized metric by @xmath30 .",
    "in linearized theory , @xmath31 would be a first order quantity .",
    "the 2-metric is uniquely determined by @xmath31 , since the determinant condition implies that the remaining dyad component @xmath32 satisfies @xmath33 .",
    "refer to  @xcite for further details , especially how to discretize the covariant derivatives and curvature scalar of a topologically spherical manifold using the @xmath34 calculus .    because the 2-metric also specifies the null data for the characteristic initial value problem , this role can be transferred to @xmath31 .",
    "terms in einstein equations that depend upon @xmath31 to higher than linear order are quadratically asymmetric .",
    "we do not explicitly introduce @xmath5 as a linearization parameter but introduce it where convenient to indicate orders of approximation .",
    "the einstein equations @xmath35 decompose into hypersurface equations , evolution equations and conservation laws . in writing the field equations",
    ", we follow the formalism given in  @xcite .",
    "we find : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the covariant derivative and @xmath38 the curvature scalar of the 2-metric @xmath39 .    the quasispherical version of ( [ eq : beta ] ) follows immediately from rewriting it as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is quadratically asymmetric .",
    "this defines the quasispherical equation @xmath42 thus in this approximation , @xmath43 . for a family of outgoing null cones which emanate from a nonsingular geodesic worldline , we could choose coordinate conditions so that @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , in minkowski space , we could set @xmath44 for null hypersurfaces which emanate from a non - accelerating spherical worldtube of constant radius . in a schwarzschild spacetime , due to red shift effects ,",
    "@xmath45 need not vanish even on a spherically symmetric worldtube .",
    "thus @xmath45 represents some physical information as well as asymmetric gauge freedom in the choice of coordinates and choice of world tube .",
    "we wish to apply the same procedure to equations ( [ eq : u ] ) and ( [ eq : v ] ) . in doing so , it is useful to introduce the @xmath46 tensor field @xmath47 which represents the difference between the connection @xmath37 and the unit sphere connection @xmath48 , e.g. @xmath49 . in solving for @xmath50 , we use the intermediate variable @xmath51    then ( [ eq : u ] ) reduces to the first order radial equations @xmath52 we deal with these equations in terms of the spin - weighted fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 . to obtain quasispherical versions of these equations ,",
    "we rewrite ( [ eq : qa ] ) and ( [ eq : ua ] ) as @xmath55 where @xmath56 , \\\\ n_u & = & r^{-2}e^{2\\beta}q_{a } \\left(h^{ab}-q^{ab}\\right ) q_b.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the quasispherical versions obtained by setting @xmath57 in ( [ eq : wqa ] ) and @xmath58 in ( [ eq : wua ] ) then take the form @xmath59 in terms of the spin - weighted differential operator @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath60 and @xmath61 are asymmetric of @xmath46 , we use the gauge freedom to ensure that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are @xmath46 .    since @xmath64 in minkowski space",

    "\\label{eq : nj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quasispherical evolution equation follows from ( [ eq : wev ] ) by setting @xmath73 .",
    "the remaining independent equations are the conservation conditions . for a worldtube given by @xmath74 ,",
    "these are given in terms of the einstein tensor by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is any vector field tangent to the worldtube .",
    "this expresses conservation of @xmath77-momentum flowing across the worldtube  @xcite .",
    "these equations simplify when the bondi coordinates are adapted to the worldtube so that the angular coordinates @xmath9 are constant along the @xmath78 streamlines .",
    "then @xmath79 on the worldtube and an independent set of conservation equations is given ( in the quasispherical approximation ) in terms of the ricci tensor by @xmath80 in the context of an extraction problem it is assumed that the interior solution satisfies the einstein equations , and therefore that the conservation conditions are automatically satisfied on the extraction worldtube .",
    "the above equations define a quasispherical truncation of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "because these quasispherical equations retain some terms which are nonlinear in the asymmetry , their solutions are not necessarily linearized solutions in a schwarzschild background .",
    "however , in the perturbative limit off schwarzschild , the linearized solutions to these truncated equations agree with the linearized solutions to the full einstein equations .",
    "in this section we describe a numerical implementation , based on second - order accurate finite differences , of the equations presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",

    "the above algorithm has a local error @xmath132 in each zone . in carrying out the radial march ,",
    "this leads to @xmath133 error at any given physical point in the uncompactified manifold .",

    "the quasispherical evolution equation  ( [ eq : wev ] ) then reduces to @xmath141 where @xmath142 because all 2-dimensional wave operators are conformally flat , with conformal weight @xmath143 , we can apply to ( [ eq : wev1 ] ) a flat - space identity relating the values of @xmath144 at the corners @xmath145 , @xmath62 , @xmath82 and @xmath146 of a null parallelogram @xmath147 with sides formed by incoming and outgoing radial characteristics . in terms of @xmath144 , this relation leads to an integral form of the evolution equation , @xmath148    the corners of the null parallelogram can not be chosen to lie exactly on the grid because the velocity of light in terms of the @xmath104 coordinate is not constant . numerical analysis and experimentation",
    "has shown  @xcite that a stable algorithm results by placing this parallelogram so that the sides formed by incoming rays intersect adjacent @xmath8-hypersurfaces at equal but opposite @xmath104-displacement from the neighboring grid points .",
    "the elementary computational cell consists of the lattice points @xmath149 and @xmath150 on the `` old '' hypersurface and the points @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the values of @xmath144 at the vertices of the parallelogram are approximated to second order accuracy by linear interpolations between nearest neighbor grid points on the same outgoing characteristic .",
    "then , by approximating the integrand by its value at the center @xmath154 of the parallelogram , we have @xmath155 as a result , the discretized version of ( [ eq : wev1 ] ) is given by @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a linear function of the @xmath158 s and angular indexes have been suppressed .",
    "consequently , it is possible to move through the interior of the grid computing @xmath159 by an explicit radial march using the fact that the value of @xmath144 on the world tube is known .",
    "the above scheme is sufficient for second order accurate evolution in the interior of the radial domain .",
    "however , for startup purposes , special care must be taken to handle the second radial point . in determining @xmath160 the strategy ( [ eq : wev2 ] )",
    "is easily modified so that just two radial points are needed on the @xmath161 level ; the parallelogram is placed so that @xmath145 and @xmath62 lie precisely on @xmath162 and @xmath163 respectively .",
    "note that the calculation of @xmath164 poses no problems , since the values of @xmath66 , @xmath63 , and @xmath61 are known on the worldtube and the value of @xmath70 on the worldtube can be calculated by ( [ eq : ww ] ) .    in order to apply this scheme globally",
    "we must also take into account technical problems concerning the order of accuracy for points near @xmath103 .",
    "for this purpose , it is convenient to renormalize ( [ eq : wev3 ] ) by introducing the intermediate variable @xmath165 . this new variable has the desired feature of finite behavior at @xmath103 . with this substitution",
    "the evolution equation becomes @xmath166 where all the terms have finite asymptotic value .",
    "some of the fundamental issues underlying stability of the evolution algorithm are discussed in appendix  [ app : stab ] . we have carried out numerical experiments which confirm that the code is stable , subject to the cfl condition , in the perturbation regime where caustics and horizons do not form .",
    "the first set of tests consist of evolving short wavelength initial null data , with all world tube data set to zero . in this case",
    ", the world tube effectively acts as a mirror to ingoing gravitational waves .",
    "the tests were run until all waves were reflected and radiated away to @xmath103 . in particular , data with @xmath167 was run from from @xmath168 to @xmath169 , corresponding to approximately @xmath170 timesteps , at which time it was checked that the amplitude was decaying .    in the second set of tests , we included short wavelength data with amplitude @xmath171 for the boundary values of @xmath94 , @xmath31 , @xmath63 , @xmath62 and @xmath66 on the world tube ( with compact support in time ) as well for the initial data for @xmath31 ( with compact support on the initial null hypersurface ) .",

    "this test reveals a favorably robust stability of the worldtube initial value problem , since in this case the world tube conservation conditions which guarantee that the exterior evolution be a vacuum einstein solution were not imposed upon the worldtube data .",
    "we now present code tests for the accuracy of numerical solutions and their waveforms at infinity .",
    "the tests are based upon linearized solutions on a minkowski background and linearized robinson - trautman solutions .",
    "these solutions provide testbeds for code calibration as well as consistent worldtube boundary values for an external vacuum solution .",
    "in addition , we use numerical solutions of the nonlinear robinson - trautman equation to study the waveform errors introduced by the quasispherical approximation .",
    "appendices [ app : gauge ] and [ app : lin ] describe how to generate 3-dimensional linearized solutions on a minkowski background in null cone coordinates and their gauge freedom . to calibrate the accuracy of the code ,",

    "however , for larger @xmath221 , corresponding to a total radiative mass loss greater than @xmath227 , this is no longer the case and a noticeable discrepancy arises .",
    "for instance , as illustrated in figure [ fig : kuama_2 ] , the difference between quadratically rescaling @xmath225 and its actual value is about @xmath228 for a mass loss of @xmath229 .    hence , this indicates that not only the first order perturbation treatment but also the second order treatment is grossly inaccurate in this regime .",
    "serious discrepancies arise between @xmath219 and @xmath220 for ranges in which the mass loss is not extreme . in fact , @xmath219 reveals an oscillatory behavior qualitatively quite different from the pure decaying mode of the perturbative solution , which has serious implications for the tidal acceleration which the radiation would produce in a distant gravitational wave antenna .",
    "as measured by the radiative component of the weyl tensor @xmath230 , the tidal acceleration is given by the bondi - time derivative of the news function .",
    "in contrast to the monotonic decay of the perturbative solution , the actual behavior of @xmath230 exhibits damped oscillations . for a @xmath231 initial mode , figure [ fig : radia ] shows the drastic difference between the numerically obtained @xmath232 and the corresponding @xmath233 calculated with the perturbative solution .",
    "similar nonlinear oscillations arise from other choices of initial data",

    "a key feature is that the characteristic evolution can be rigorously compactified , so that the whole space - time to future null infinity may be represented on a finite grid . from a numerical point of view",
    "this means that the only error made in a calculation of the gravitational radiation at infinity is due to the finite discretization @xmath236 ; for second - order algorithms this is @xmath119 .",
    "the value of the matching radius @xmath237 is important and it will turn out that , for efficiency , it should be as small as possible .",

    "on the other hand , the standard approach is to make an estimate of the gravitational radiation solely from the data calculated in a pure cauchy evolution .",
    "the simplest method would be to use the raw data , but that approach is too crude because it mixes gauge effects with the physics .",
    "thus a substantial amount of work has gone into perturbative methods that factor out the gauge effects using multipole expansions and estimate the gravitational field at infinity from its behavior within the domain of the cauchy computation  @xcite .",
    "we will call this method waveform extraction , or we . while we is a substantial improvement on the crude approach",

    "there is an error ( which is difficult to estimate ) due to the artificial cauchy outer boundary condition .",
    "the difference between cce and we is in the treatment of the nonlinear terms between @xmath0 and future null infinity and in the truncation of the perturbative multipole expansion at some low order .",
    "we ignores the nonlinear terms , and this is an inherent limitation of a perturbative method . even if it is possible to extend we beyond linear order , there would necessarily be a cut - off at some finite order .",
    "the quasispherical implementation of cce incorporates all multipole contributions but also ignores the nonlinear terms .",
    "however , it is in principle straightforward to incorporate these terms into the code .",
    "a full implementation of cce would do so , and the nonlinear terms would be treated without error .",
    "we assume that a pure cauchy evolution proceeds in a spatial domain of radius @xmath238 , and the extraction is computed on a worldtube @xmath0 of radius @xmath82 , with @xmath239 .",
    "the evolution equation ( [ eq : wev ] ) may be written : @xmath240 with the nonlinear term @xmath241 given by ( [ eq : nj ] ) ( actually , @xmath241 also implicitly contains contributions from @xmath242 and @xmath243 , and from the quasispherical approximation of terms in ( [ eq : wev ] ) , but these effects are all of the same order as @xmath241 ) .",

    "should this not be the case then constants of order unity would be added to @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath66 , and the effect of this would be to amend ( [ eq : wev ] ) by adding terms to the quasispherical part so that it represents wave propagation on a ( fixed ) non - flat background .",
    "however , the order of magnitude of terms in the nonlinear part would not be affected .",
    "thus there is no loss of generality , and a significant gain in simplicity and transparency , in performing the error analysis on a minkowskian background .",
    "it is straightforward to confirm that the nonlinear correction to ( [ eq : wev ] ) involves terms of order @xmath247 or smaller .",
    "we estimates the waveform at future null infinity from data at @xmath248 .",
    "this could be made exact ( modulo the error introduced by truncating the multipole expansion ) if the nonlinear part of ( [ eq : wev ] ) were zero .",
    "thus the error introduced by ignoring @xmath241 is @xmath249 in the case of the collision of two black holes , with total mass @xmath213 and with @xmath250 , the error is @xmath251 and it is tempting to say that if extraction is performed at @xmath252 then the expected error of the we method is about 1%",

    "we now estimate the amount of computation required for a given desired accuracy .",
    "we make one important assumption :    * the computation involved in matching , and in waveform extraction , is an order of magnitude smaller than the computation involved in evolution , and is ignored .",
    "this is justified by the 2d nature of the extraction and matching processes as opposed to the 3d nature of evolution .    for the sake of transparency",
    "we make some additional simplifying assumptions ( otherwise some extra constants of order unity would appear in the formulas below but the qualitative conclusions would be unaffected ) :    1 .",
    "the amount of computation per grid point per time - step , @xmath259 , is the same for the cauchy and characteristic algorithms .",

    "( because of the assumptions ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) this criterion is not exact but only approximate . )",
    "as stated earlier , the value of @xmath237 is determined by the physics , specifically by the condition that the nonlinearities outside @xmath237 must be sufficiently weak so as not to induce caustics .",
    "the value of @xmath82 is determined by the accuracy condition ( [ eq : ce2 ] ) , and also by the condition that the nonlinearities outside @xmath82 must be sufficiently weak for the existence of a perturbative expansion .",
    "thus we never expect @xmath82 to be significantly smaller than @xmath237 , and therefore the computational efficiency of a ccm algorithm is never expected to be significantly worse than that of a we algorithm .",

    "the computer code described in this paper is a partial implementation of cce .",
    "that is , given data on an @xmath74 worldtube @xmath0 , the code calculates the gravitational radiation at future null infinity in the quasispherical approximation . a full implementation of cce is currently being developed which addresses the following issues :    * the ignored nonlinear terms in the einstein equations must be calculated , discretized and incorporated into the code .",

    "for example , if @xmath0 has radius @xmath82 and the radius of the cauchy domain is @xmath238 ( @xmath272 ) , then causality implies that the gravitational field at @xmath0 will not be contaminated by boundary errors until time @xmath273 , where @xmath274 at the start of the simulation .",
    "there is no analytic error in the characteristic computation , so there will be no analytic error in the gravitational radiation at future null infinity for the initial time period @xmath275 ; under some circumstances this may be the time period that is physically interesting .",
    "further , this time period @xmath275 may be extended by using results from the characteristic computation to provide the outer boundary condition in the cauchy calculation .",
    "this would amount to a partial implementation of ccm since there would be data flow in both cauchy to characteristic , and characteristic to cauchy , directions ( the implementation is only partial because @xmath82 and @xmath238 are very different ) .",
    "since the data flow is two - way , the possibility of a numerical instability arises .",
    "however , the timescale of the growth of any instability would be @xmath275 , and therefore such a computation could be safely run for a time of several @xmath275 ; the results obtained would be second - order convergent to the true analytic solution .",
    "once the technology for cauchy to characteristic , and characteristic to cauchy , data flow across an arbitrary worldtube has been developed , a full implementation of ccm will amount to taking the limit in which the outer boundary approaches the extraction worldtube .",
