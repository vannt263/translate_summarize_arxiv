    "a _ classical link _ @xmath5 consists of finitely many , pairwise disjoint , piecewise smooth closed curves in @xmath6 or @xmath7 ; each individual closed curve is a _ component _ of @xmath5 .",
    "a _ regular diagram _",
    "@xmath0 of @xmath5 is obtained from a regular projection in the plane  that is , a projection whose only singularities are double points called _ crossings _  by specifying the over - and under - crossing arcs at each crossing .",
    "the projection itself is a 4-regular plane graph @xmath3 , the _ universe _ of @xmath0 . saying that @xmath3 is a _ plane graph _",
    "means that it is given with a specific embedding in @xmath8 ; when the embedding is forgotten @xmath3 becomes an _",
    "abstract graph_. we presume @xmath5 is given with orientations of its components ; these orientations make @xmath3 into a 2-in , 2-out digraph @xmath1 .",
    "combinatorial structures associated with @xmath0 incorporate geometric information about its embedding in the plane in various ways  for instance the classical checkerboard graph is defined using the connected components of @xmath9 , a rigid graph specifies for each vertex of @xmath3 the cyclic order of the incident edges , a signed gauss code specifies the cyclic order of the crossings on each link component along with underpassing - overpassing information at each crossing , and an atom includes an embedding of a graph on a surface .",
    "most combinatorial structures associated to classical link diagrams must be adjusted when we try to extend them to _ virtual link diagrams _",
    "each crossing in a virtual link diagram has three possible configurations .",
    "in addition to the two classical configurations with different choices of under- and over - crossing arcs , there is the virtual configuration , in which two arcs of the diagram simply cross each other without intersecting .",
    "the virtual crossings are not really there  @xcite , in the same way that a plane representation of a graph may contain apparent edge - intersections that are not really there .",
    "the universe of a virtual link diagram is an abstract 4-regular graph with vertices corresponding only to the classical crossings ; the virtual diagram gives a regular immersion of the graph in @xmath8 , not an embedding as in the classical case .",
    "the virtual crossings naturally suggest an embedding of the universe on a closed , orientable surface @xmath10 of some genus , and the diagram can then be thought of as representing a link in the thickened surface @xmath11 . consequently one way to extend notions involving the plane geometry of classical link diagrams is to use the geometry of the surface @xmath10 ; for instance the classical checkerboard graphs extend in this manner to atoms associated with virtual diagrams .",
    "( by the way we should make it clear that we use the terms _ link _ , _ virtual link _ and _ classical or virtual link _ interchangeably ; when we want to be restrictive we specify that a link is classical or non - classical . )    the kauffman bracket and jones polynomial of a classical link @xmath5 may be described in a variety of ways using combinatorial structures associated with regular diagrams of @xmath5 ; kauffman s basic description follows .",
    "each crossing of a regular diagram @xmath0 has two _ smoothings _ , one denoted @xmath12 and the other denoted @xmath13 ; distinguishing between them is another example of the use of geometric information mentioned in the first paragraph above , as it involves the orientation of the plane in which @xmath0 is drawn . if @xmath0 has @xmath14 crossings then it has @xmath15 _ states _ , obtained by applying either the @xmath16 or the @xmath13 smoothing at each crossing .",
    "given a state @xmath10 let @xmath17 denote the number of @xmath16 smoothings in @xmath10 , @xmath18 the number of @xmath13 smoothings in @xmath10 , and @xmath19 the number of simple closed curves in @xmath20 , including any crossing - free components that might appear in @xmath0 .",
    "( these simple closed curves are called `` loops '' in @xcite , but we reserve this word for graph - theoretic use . )",

    "a classical link diagram @xmath0 has an _ alternating _ orientation on its universe @xmath3  i.e. , the edges of @xmath3 may be directed in such a way that when one traverses any component of the link , one encounters forward- and backward - directed edges alternately .",
    "such an alternating orientation arises naturally from the cycles that bound the complementary regions of @xmath0 , and is associated with the relationship between kauffman states of @xmath0 and spanning forests in the checkerboard graph that underlies the jones - tutte connection .",
    "this connection between spanning forests and kauffman states is also part of a combinatorial discussion of the alexander polynomial @xcite . by the way ,",
    "the relationship between eulerian circuits and spanning trees in regular directed graphs , known as the best theorem , appeared in the combinatorial literature long before the jones polynomial was introduced @xcite ; the special relationship between circuit partitions in a 4-regular plane graph and the tutte polynomial of an associated checkerboard graph also appeared first outside knot theory @xcite .",
    "the kauffman bracket of a virtual link diagram is described in almost exactly the same way as that of a classical link diagram ; the only difference is that we can not say that @xmath19 denotes the number of _ simple _ closed curves in @xmath10 , as the closed curves need not be simple .",
    "much of the jones - tutte machinery extends directly to virtual link diagrams which possess alternating orientations or ( equivalently ) orientable atoms ; see @xcite and also chapter iv of @xcite .",
    "if the tutte polynomial is augmented with topological information to give an invariant of graphs embedded on surfaces as in @xcite , then the relationship between links in thickened surfaces and virtual links leads to a general relationship between this topological tutte polynomial and the jones polynomial @xcite .    in @xcite zulli and",
    "the present author proposed a different , purely combinatorial approach to the jones polynomials and kauffman brackets of classical and virtual knots ( one - component links ) that uses surprisingly little geometric information about knot diagrams , and does not involve either the ordinary tutte polynomial or the topological tutte polynomial . if @xmath0 is a regular diagram of a classical or virtual knot @xmath22 then the universe @xmath3 of @xmath0 has an interlacement graph defined with respect to the euler circuit obtained directly from @xmath22 , and the kauffman bracket @xmath23 $ ] can be obtained from this interlacement graph without using complementary regions , ordering the crossings , specifying over- and under - crossing arcs , ordering the edges incident on a vertex , distinguishing between smoothings , counting closed curves , or considering closed surfaces of any genus .",
    "all that is required is to record whether each crossing s contribution to the writhe is + 1 or -1 ; this is done by attaching a loop to each vertex that corresponds to a crossing whose writhe contribution is -1 .",
    "the resulting _ looped interlacement graph _ is denoted @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath24 is obtained by considering @xmath3 as an abstract graph rather than an embedded one , so any virtual crossings are really not there ( rather than merely not really there )  as far as @xmath24 is concerned .",
    "the analysis of @xcite describes the jones polynomial of a classical or virtual knot as the result of the composition of three functions .",
    "the first function is the looped interlacement graph construction .",
    "the second function associates a 3-variable graph bracket polynomial to an arbitrary graph , using either a recursion involving the local complement and pivot operations that have appeared in the theory of circle graphs and interlace polynomials @xcite or a formula involving matrix nullities over @xmath25 .",
    "zulli @xcite proved that this formula , when applied to looped interlacement graphs , correctly assesses the number of closed curves in each kauffman state .",
    "the third function modifies the 3-variable graph bracket polynomial so that the resulting graph jones polynomial is invariant under appropriate graph  reidemeister moves .",

    "an interlacement graph of a 4-regular graph or a 2-in , 2-out digraph is constructed by using a specific euler circuit , or if the original graph is not connected a specific _ euler system _ containing an euler circuit for each connected component .",
    "a classical or virtual knot diagram has an euler circuit arising naturally from the diagrammed knot , but in general there is no canonical choice of an euler system in a universe @xmath3 associated to a diagram @xmath0 representing a multi - component link . consequently our discussion of this step in section 2 involves two complications that did not affect @xcite : @xmath3 need not be connected , and we must allow a variety of euler systems in @xmath3 .",
    "the first of these complications is accommodated using a common graph - theoretic convention , which allows graphs to include free loops ; a free loop is not incident on any vertex , but does count as a connected component . if @xmath3 is a disconnected graph with @xmath30 connected components , we record  this fact by inserting @xmath31 free loops into the interlacement graph @xmath4 .",
    "this might seem unnatural at first , but it is necessary if we want to recover the kauffman bracket from @xmath4 ; without some such convention interlacement can not detect crossing - free unknotted components , or ( more generally ) distinguish connected sums from split unions .",
    "[ ptb ]    lbracfi2.ps    the second complication is handled by adopting a convention to identify the euler system used to produce a looped interlacement graph @xmath4 .",
    "we presume the link @xmath5 is given with orientations of its components , and we restrict our attention to directed euler systems of the directed universe @xmath1 .",
    "each crossing of @xmath0 is then marked to record which of the two possible _ transitions _",
    "( edge - pairings ) occurs at that crossing in the euler system @xmath2 used to produce @xmath4 .",
    "( transitions provide a standard combinatorial description of circuits in 4-regular graphs and 2-in , 2-out digraphs ; see for instance @xcite . )",
    "crossings at which @xmath2 follows the incident link component(s ) are left unmarked , and crossings at which @xmath2 is orientation - consistent with the incident link component(s ) but does not  follow it ( or them ) are marked with the letter @xmath32 ; see figures [ lbracfi2 ] and [ lbracfi3 ] . the same convention is used to mark the vertices of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . according to results discussed in @xcite , different directed euler systems of @xmath1 are interconnected through _ transposition _ , a combinatorial operation .",
    "it follows that changing the choice of @xmath2 affects @xmath4 through an appropriately modified version of the pivot operation , which we call a _ marked pivot_.    [ tb ]    lbracfi3.ps    as in @xcite , the second step uses a formula involving matrix nullities over @xmath25 to associate a 3-variable bracket polynomial to an arbitrary graph ; but now we consider arbitrary graphs with marked vertices .",
    "the marked - graph bracket polynomial of a looped interlacement graph @xmath33 is the same as the kauffman bracket polynomial of @xmath0 ; the relationship between the matrix nullity formula and the kauffman bracket is verified using an extension of a combinatorial equality due to cohn and lempel @xcite .",
    "this equality is presented briefly in section 4 , and more fully in @xcite ; it incorporates the cohn - lempel equality along with results used in @xcite .    in section 5",
    "we define the 3-variable marked - graph bracket polynomial and deduce that @xmath34=[d]$ ] .",
    "we also prove a very useful result : the bracket is invariant under the marked pivot operation mentioned above .",
    "this invariance allows us to develop the theory of the marked - graph bracket using many of the results of @xcite , even though marked graphs did not appear there ; in essence , we often use marked pivots to simply push marked vertices out of the way .",
    "for instance , in section 6 we show that the recursion given in @xcite extends to a recursive description of the marked - graph bracket polynomial involving the local complementation and pivot operations .",
    "the recursion uses formulas that can only be applied to special configurations in which certain vertices have no marked neighbors ; such configurations can always be created using marked pivots .",
    "the third step involves proving that the marked - graph bracket polynomial yields a marked - graph jones polynomial that is invariant under certain reidemeister moves on marked graphs ; these graph moves generate the `` images ''  of the familiar reidemeister moves of knot theory under the construction of @xmath4 .",
    "we say _ generate _ because we do not explicitly exhibit all the marked - graph reidemeister moves ; following an idea of stlund @xcite , we only exhibit enough basic moves to generate the rest through composition . as in @xcite , the fact that @xmath4 is defined by considering @xmath3 as an abstract graph rather than",
    "a graph drawn on a plane or a surface is reflected in the fact that we can simply ignore the virtual reidemeister moves of @xcite .    in sum ,",
    "our results show that the kauffman bracket and jones polynomial can be defined for either of the following abstract ( non - embedded ) combinatorial structures .",
    "* a 2-in , 2-out digraph @xmath1 , given with a partition of its edge - set into directed circuits and a partition of its vertex - set into two subsets * an undirected graph @xmath35 , given with a partition of its vertex - set into two subsets    it would be interesting to understand how these two types of abstract combinatorial structures are related to other knot - theoretic notions . for instance , orientable and non - orientable atoms have been used for a variety of purposes , e.g. , to construct khovanov homology for virtual knots @xcite .",
    "atoms involve graphs embedded on surfaces , so they contain more geometric information than the abstract combinatorial structures .",
    "perhaps some constructions based on atoms do not require all of this geometric information , and can be modified to use one of the abstract combinatorial structures .",
    "manturov has also recently introduced the idea of _ free _ knots and links , which are equivalence classes of 4-regular graphs under modified versions of the reidemeister moves @xcite ; they are related to the first kind of abstract combinatorial structure mentioned above , with the vertex - partition forgotten .",
    "perhaps the combinatorial theory of circuit partitions in 4-regular graphs will turn out to be useful in defining invariants of these objects .",
    "it would also be interesting to conduct a purely combinatorial investigation of the bracket as an invariant of either of these structures , apart from the special case in which @xmath1 is the universe of a diagram of an oriented link , the circuit partition of @xmath36 consists of the link s components , the partition of @xmath37 represents the distinction between positive and negative crossings , @xmath35 is the looped interlacement graph of @xmath1 with respect to an euler system @xmath2 , the partition of @xmath38 represents vestigial information regarding @xmath2 , and free loops represent all but one of the connected components of @xmath3 . in particular , we wonder whether there might be a useful relationship between the bracket polynomial and the interlace polynomials of @xcite or the multivariate interlace polynomial of @xcite .",
    "the same comments apply to the jones polynomial , which is naturally regarded as a simplification of the bracket , modified so as to be invariant under a certain equivalence relation which is motivated topologically but may be described in purely combinatorial terms .    before closing this introduction",
    "we should thank l. zulli for many hours spent working together to formulate and make precise the ideas of @xcite , and also for his comments on early drafts of the current paper .",
    "d. p. ilyutko was kind enough to bring @xcite to our attention ; the present work developed as we tried to understand the differences and similarities of the two approaches .",
    "v. o. manturov s good advice improved the paper in several ways .",
    "we are also grateful to lafayette college for its support .",
    "in this section we discuss some terminology and results about eulerian graphs , and then apply these notions to link diagrams .",
    "eulerian graphs have been studied for centuries ; it is not surprising that terminology has varied over the years , and some results have been rediscovered . for us",
    "a _ graph _ may have loops or multiple edges , and each edge has two distinct _ directions _ ; in a _ directed graph _ a preferred direction has been chosen for each edge .",
    "the terms _ adjacent _ and _ neighbor _ refer to non - loop edges only ; no vertex is adjacent to itself or a neighbor of itself . in order to provide appropriate notation for the two different directions of a loop , each edge",
    "is technically regarded as consisting of two distinct half - edges , one incident on each end - vertex ; the preferred direction of a directed edge is expressed by designating one half - edge as _ _",
    "initial _ _ and the other as _ terminal_. we will almost always abuse notation by leaving it to the reader to split edges into half - edges .",
    "a _ path _ in a graph is a sequence @xmath39 ( technically @xmath40 where @xmath41 has the half - edges @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) such that for each @xmath44 , the vertices @xmath45 and @xmath46 are incident on the edge @xmath41 ; in a directed graph a _ directed path _ must respect all edge - directions , and an _ undirected path _ might not respect some edge - directions .",
    "if @xmath47 the path is _ closed _ ; in this case it is customary but not mandatory to omit @xmath48 from the list .",
    "a _ circuit _ is a closed path in which no edge appears more than once ; digraphs have _ directed circuits _ and _ undirected circuits_. an _ euler circuit _ in a connected graph is a circuit in which every edge of the graph appears , and an _ euler system _ in a graph is a  set that contains one euler circuit for each connected component .",
    "a connected , undirected graph has an euler circuit if and only if every vertex is of even degree ; a connected , directed graph has a directed euler circuit if and only if every vertex has equal indegree and outdegree .",
    "we allow graphs to have _",
    "free loops_. these do not interact in any way with the vertices and edges of the graph , and they do not affect anything we would otherwise say about the graph , except for the fact that each free loop is counted as a connected component . in particular , a free loop is not a kind of loop ; indeed if the terminology were not standard we would call them `` empty components . ''  for example , if an undirected graph @xmath49 consists of a 4-cycle and two free loops then @xmath35 is 2-regular , and if @xmath50 are two edges in @xmath35 that are not incident on the same vertex then @xmath51 is bipartite and 1-regular ; @xmath35 has three connected components and @xmath52 has four . as a free loop is a connected component , an euler system for a graph must contain all the graph s free loops . in figures representing graphs ,",
