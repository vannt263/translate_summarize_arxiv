    ", i will try to define it with minimum bias .",
    "boltzmann s epitaph reads @xmath4 with @xmath5 in semi - classical approximation .",
    "@xmath2 is the total energy , @xmath6 is the number of particles and @xmath7 the volume . or , more appropriate for a finite quantum - mechanical system : @xmath8\\label{quantums}\\\\ & = & \\sum{\\scriptsize\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{all eigenstates n of h",

    "this is still up to day the deepest , most fundamental , and most simple definition of entropy .",
    "there is no need of the thermodynamic limit , no need of concavity , extensivity and homogeneity . in its semi - classical approximation , eq.([boltzmann ] ) , @xmath10 simply measures the area of the sub - manifold of points in the @xmath11-dimensional phase - space ( @xmath12-space ) with prescribed energy @xmath2 , particle number @xmath6 , volume @xmath7 , and some other time invariant constraints which are here suppressed for simplicity . because it was planck who coined it in this mathematical form ,",
    "i will call it the boltzmann - planck principle .",
    "there are various reviews on the mathematical foundation of statistical mechanics e.g. the detailed and instructive article by alfred wehrl @xcite .",
    "he shows how the boltzmann - planck formula ( 1 ) , with ( 3 ) can be generalized to the famous definition of entropy in quantum mechanics by von neumann@xcite @xmath13,\\label{neumann}\\]]addressing general ( non projector like ) densities @xmath14 .",
    "wehrl discusses the conventional canonical boltzmann - gibbs statistics where all constraints are only fixed to their mean , allowing for free fluctuations .",
    "he points to the many serious complications of this definition .",
    "however , in the case of _ conserved _ observables we know more than their mean .",
    "we know these quantities sharply . in _",
    "thermodynamics we do nt need von neumann s definition ( [ neumann ] ) and can work on the level of boltzmann - planck s original definition of @xmath3 by eqs.([boltzmann0 ] and [ quantums ] ) .",
    "we thus explore statistical mechanics and entropy on its most fundamental level .",
    "this has the great advantage that the axiomatic level is extremely simple .",
    "because it does not demand scaling or extensivity , it can further be applied to the much wider group of non - extensive systems from nuclei to galaxies @xcite and address the original object of thermodynamics for which it was invented some 150 years ago : phase separations .",
    "the boltzmann - planck formula has a direct and simple but deep physical interpretation : _",
    "@xmath15 or @xmath3 are the measure of our ignorance about the complete set of initial values for all @xmath11 microscopic degrees of freedom which are needed to specify the @xmath6-body system unambiguously _",
    "usually we only know the few time - independent control parameters @xmath16 , of the system ( conserved or very slowly varying ) but have no control of the other fast changing degrees of freedom .",
    "if the information would be complete , i.e. all @xmath11-degrees of freedom sharply known at some time @xmath17 , @xmath15 would be a single cell of size @xmath18 in the @xmath11-dim .",
    "phase space , and @xmath3 would be @xmath19",
    ".    however , many initial values are consistent with the same values of @xmath20 , ( redundancy of control parameters ) .",
    "all the other degrees of freedom vary with time , usually fast , and are normally not under control .",
    "the manifold of all these points in the @xmath11-dim .",
    "phase space is the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "it has a well defined geometrical size @xmath15 and due to eq.([boltzmann0 ] ) a non - vanishing entropy @xmath21 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath22 on its arguments gives the complete thermostatics and equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "it is further clear that the hamiltonian ( liouvillean ) dynamics of the system can not create the missing information about the initial values .",
    "i.e. the entropy @xmath22 can not decrease .",
    "as is further worked out in @xcite and more recently in @xcite the inherent finite resolution of the macroscopic description implies usually an _ increase _ of @xmath15 or @xmath3 with time when a constraint is removed ( second law of thermodynamics ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that this proper _ statistical _ definition of the entropy @xmath22 characterizes the _ whole _ microcanonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "it measures the total number of the _ possible _ states of the system under the information given .",
    "( [ boltzmann],[quantums ] ) are in clear contrast to the definition suggested by @xcite : @xmath23 our _ statistical _ definition ( [ boltzmann],[quantums ] ) called @xmath24 in @xcite has a priori not much to do with the adiabatic invariants of a _ single _ trajectory in the @xmath11-dim . phase space .",
    "as we will see later in section ( [ chsplit ] ) the entropy @xmath0 for non - extensive systems can be convex in contrast to the assumption made by hertz @xcite .",
    "then the temperature or the mean kinetic energy per particle do _ not _ control the energy flow during the equilibration of two systems in thermal contact as was the crucial argument of hertz @xcite to introduce @xmath25,([boltzmann*]-[sbulk ] ) .",
    "in contrast , _ the boltzmann entropy eq.([boltzmann ] ) does still control the direction of the energy - flow under equilibration _ even in these somewhat astonishing and unconventional though ubiquitous situations .",
    "this clearly underlines the role of the boltzmann entropy ( [ boltzmann ] ) as the fundamental quantity and not the temperature for statistical mechanics .",
    "i am fully aware that this contradicts opposite statements given by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the definition of the bulk entropy @xmath26 ( [ boltzmann*]-[sbulk ] ) contains also , energetically , inaccessible states with less energy , which are clearly excluded by our knowledge of the total energy .",
    "_ thus , @xmath25 does not represent the redundancy , or ignorance , of the available information_. therefore it is not acceptable by conceptual reasons .",
    "this is a clear warning that one should not follow some formal definitions and forget the original clear meaning of entropy and statistics as is often done in the literature .",
    "of course , for macroscopic systems the difference between the two alternative definitions of the entropy eqs.([boltzmann]-[quantums ] ) and eqs.([boltzmann*],[sbulk ] ) disappears .",
    "in conventional ( extensive ) thermodynamics thermal equilibrium of two systems ( 1 & 2 ) is established by bringing them into thermal contact which allows free energy exchange .",
    "equilibrium is established when the total entropy @xmath27 is maximal : @xmath28 under an energy flux @xmath29 from @xmath30 the total entropy changes to lowest order in @xmath31 by @xmath32 consequently , a maximum of @xmath33 will be approached when @xmath34 from here clausius first formulation of the second law follows : `` heat always flows from hot to cold '' .",
    "essential for this conclusion is the _ additivity _ of @xmath3 under the split ( eq.[eq1 ] ) .",
    "there are no correlations , which are destroyed when an extensive system is split .",
    "temperature is an appropriate control parameter for extensive systems .",
    "since the beginning of thermodynamics in the middle of the 19.century its main motivation was the description of steam engines and the liquid to gas transition of water",
    ". here water prefers to become inhomogeneous and develop a separation of the gas phase from the liquid , i.e. water boils . as conventional canonical statistics works only for _ homogeneous , infinite _ systems , phase separation remains outside of standard boltzmann - gibbs thermo - statistics .",
    "the weight @xmath1 of the configurations with energy e in the definition of the canonical partition sum @xmath35 becomes here _ bimodal _ , at the transition temperature it has two peaks , the liquid and the gas configurations which are separated in energy by the latent heat .",
    "consequently @xmath0 must be convex and the weight in ( [ canonicweight ] ) has a minimum between the two pure phases .",
    "of course , the minimum can only be seen in the microcanonical ensemble where the energy is controlled and its fluctuations forbidden .",
    "otherwise , the system would fluctuate between the two pure phases by an , for macroscopic systems even macroscopic , energy @xmath36 of the order of the latent heat .",
    "i.e. _ the convexity of @xmath0 is the generic signal of a phase transition of first order _ and of phase - separation@xcite .",
    "it is amusing that this fact that is essential for the original purpose of thermodynamics to describe steam engines was never treated correctly in the past 150 years .",
    "the ferromagnetic potts - model illuminates in a most simple example the occurrence of a convex intruder in @xmath0 which induces a backbending caloric curve @xmath37 with a decrease of the temperature @xmath38 with rising energy @xcite has nothing to do with the periodic boundary condition used here , as claimed erroneously by moretto et.al @xcite .",
    "many realistic microcanonical calculations for nuclear fragmentation as also for atomic - cluster fragmentation , c.f .",
    "@xcite , show the backbending _ without using periodic boundaries_. these are verified by numerous experimental data in nuclear physics c.f . @xcite and cluster physics @xcite .",
    "the errors of the above paper by moretto et .",
    "al . are commented in more detail also in @xcite ] .",
    "a typical plot of @xmath39 in the region of phase separation is shown in fig([figure 1 ] ) .",
    "section [ convex ] discusses the general microscopic reasons for the convexity .",
    "this has far reaching consequences which are crucial for the fundamental understanding of thermo - statistics and thermodynamics : let us split the system of figure ( [ figure 1 ] ) into two pieces @xmath40 & @xmath41 by a dividing surface , with half the number of particles each .",
    "the dividing surface is purely geometrical .",
    "it exists only as long as the two pieces can be distinguished by their different energy / particle @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "constraining the energy - difference @xmath44 between the two , reduces the number of free , unconstrained degrees of freedom and _ reduces _ the entropy by @xmath45 .",
    "( moreover , if the effect of the new surface would also be to cut some bonds : before the split there were configurations with attractive interactions across the surface which are interrupted by the division , their energy shifts upwards outside the permitted band - width @xmath46 , and thrown out of the partition sum ( [ quantums ] ) .",
    "i.e. the entropy will be further reduced by the split . )",
    "if the constraint on the difference @xmath47 is fully relaxed and @xmath47 can fluctuate freely at fixed @xmath48 , the dividing surface is assumed to have no further physical effect on the system .",
    "for an _ extensive _ system [ @xmath49 .",
    "one would argue as follows : the combination of two pieces of @xmath50 particles each , one at @xmath51 and a second at @xmath52 , must lead to @xmath53 , the simple algebraic sum of the individual entropies because by combining the two pieces one normally looses information .",
    "this , however , is equal to @xmath54/2 $ ] , thus @xmath55/2 $ ] .",
    "i.e. _ the entropy @xmath56 of an extensive system is necessarily concave_.    for a _ non - extensive _ system we have in general @xmath57 because again two separated , closed pieces have more information than their unification .",
    "now , if @xmath58 is the point of maximum positive curvature of @xmath56 ( convexity = upwards concave like @xmath59 ) we have @xmath60/2 $ ] like in fig.([figure 1 ] ) . however , the r.h.s . is larger than @xmath61 .",
    "i.e. even though @xmath56 is convex at const .",
    "@xmath6 , the unification of the pieces with @xmath62 and @xmath63 can still lead to a _ larger _",
    "entropy @xmath64 .",
    "the difference between @xmath54/2 $ ] and @xmath61 we call henceforth @xmath65 .",
    "the correct entropy balance , before and after establishing the energetic split @xmath66 of the system , is @xmath67 even though the difference of the first and the last term is positive .    in the inverse direction : by _ relaxing _ the constraint and allowing , on average , for an energy - flux ( @xmath68 ) _ opposite to @xmath69 , against the temperature - gradient ( slope ) _ , but in the direction of the energy - slope , the entropy @xmath70 increases .",
    "this is consistent with the naive picture of an _",
    "energy equilibration_. thus _",
    "clausius `` energy flows always from hot to cold '' , i.e. the dominant control - role of the temperature in thermo - statistics @xcite is violated_. of course this shows again that _ unlike to extensive thermodynamics the temperature is not the appropriate control parameter in non - extensive systems .",
    "_    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath71 of a system with short - range coupling @xmath72 , @xmath73 must go to @xmath19 due to van hove s theorem .",

    "<S> microcanonical thermodynamics @xcite allows the application of statistical mechanics on one hand to closed finite and even small systems and on the other to the largest , self - gravitating ones . </S>",
    "<S> however , one has to reconsider the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics especially its key quantity , entropy . </S>",
    "<S> whereas in conventional thermostatistics the homogeneity and extensivity of the system and the concavity of its entropy @xmath0 are central conditions , these fail for the systems considered here . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. at phase separation the entropy @xmath0 is necessarily convex to make @xmath1 bimodal in @xmath2 ( the two coexisting phases ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is so even for normal macroscopic systems with short - range coupling . </S>",
    "<S> as inhomogeneities and surface effects in particular can not be scaled away , one has to be careful with the standard arguments of splitting a system into two or bringing two systems into thermal contact with energy or particle exchange @xcite : not only the volume part of the entropy must be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of any other external constraint like a dividing surface reduces the entropy . as will be shown here , when removing such constraints in regions of a negative heat capacity , the system may even relax under a flow of heat ( energy ) _ against the temperature slope_. thus clausius formulation of the second law : `` heat always flows from hot to cold '' can be violated . </S>",
    "<S> _ temperature is not a necessary or fundamental control parameter of thermostatistics_. however , the second law is still satisfied and the total boltzmann - entropy keeps constant or rises when constraints are removed . in the final sections of this paper the general microscopic mechanism leading to condensation and to the convexity of the microcanonical entropy @xmath0 at phase separation is sketched . also the microscopic conditions for the existence or non - existence of a critical end - point of the phase - separation are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> this is explained for the liquid  </S>",
    "<S> gas and the solid  liquid transition . </S>"
