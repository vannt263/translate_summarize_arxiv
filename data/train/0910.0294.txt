    "the general term ` pattern formation ' refers to the spontaneous appearance of structure in a dissipative dynamical system in a continuum or spatially discrete medium , when a spatially homogeneous state undergoes an instability of some kind @xcite . in many physical situations",
    "it is appropriate to use mathematical models for which the spatial dynamics are modelled discretely , rather than as a continuum .",
    "such lattice models arise in many physical applications : in particular we mention recent work in nonlinear optics @xcite and mathematical modelling of processes in developmental biology @xcite . in many applications",
    "the existence of domain - filling ( almost ) regular solutions exhibiting spatial periodicity is of interest .",
    "mathematical work on periodic patterns in regular lattices has also been the subject of considerable recent interest @xcite .",
    "in addition , there has been a renewed interest in the study of localized states in nonlinear dissipative systems in recent years , motivated by a wealth of experimental and numerical results both in continuum systems @xcite and spatially discrete models @xcite .",
    "such localized states have been referred to by a number of different names , including ` light bullets ' and ` dissipative solitons ' .    in continuum systems one recurring mechanism for the generation of localized states",
    "is the existence of a subcritical turing ( pattern - forming ) instability . in the simplest case ,",
    "two branches of small - amplitude localized states emerge at the turing instability , also in this context referred to as a hamiltonian ",
    "hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "away from the initial instability they develop into a complicated structure of fully nonlinear localized states which exist on a pair of intertwining curves @xcite ; a complete asymptotic description of the bifurcation structure involves consideration of exponentially - small effects @xcite . in an infinite domain",
    "this ` homoclinic snaking ' behaviour continues , and the width of the localized states increases without bound .",
    "in a finite domain the branches of localized states terminate on the branches of spatially periodic patterns which also originate at the initial turing instability @xcite .",
    "there is now a pretty complete picture of the existence and stability of localized states in canonical 1d model equations , for example the swift  hohenberg model @xcite with quadratic - cubic or cubic - quintic nonlinearities , but in contrast , comparatively little is known about the detailed structure of localized states in spatially discrete problems .",
    "motivation for the detailed investigation of discrete models comes from a number of sources , but in particular discrete models arise as natural descriptions of arrays of waveguides in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "for example , the discrete bistable nonlinear schrdinger equation i_n + c_n + s_n |_n|^2 - _ n|_n|^4 = 0 , [ eqn : dnls ] for an array of complex fields",
    "@xmath0 naturally describes properties of discrete optical ` dissipative solitons ' in a @xmath1-dimensional square lattice whose sites are indexed by the ( multiple ) suffix @xmath2 .",
    "the operator @xmath3 is an appropriate sum of nearest neighbour ( and possibly next - nearest neighbour ) differences depending on the lattice dimension coefficient @xmath1 . substituting the ansatz @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a real stationary field",
    ", we see that @xmath5 must satisfy the real difference equation u_n + c u_n + su_n^3 - u_n^5 = 0 .",
    "[ eqn : ac ] hence the possible steady states correspond to those of a discrete allen  cahn equation @xcite , albeit with a cubic - quintic nonlinearity rather than the well - studied purely cubic case .    in this letter",
    "we investigate the existence of localized states in the canonical nonlinear lattice model  ( [ eqn : ac ] ) in one and two dimensions .",
    "such models are in many senses simpler than the corresponding spatially continuous equations and we discuss the similarities and differences that arise . to aid this discussion we add a time derivative term to  ( [ eqn : ac ] ) which makes stability correspond to that found in the spatially - continuous swift  hohenberg model .",
    "in contrast to previous work on this canonical problem by other authors , our central focus in this paper is on the appearance of isolas .",
    "in particular we show that , firstly , in 1d and on a finite lattice , isolas are an immediate consequence of changing the boundary conditions from periodic to neumann ( or , in fact , dirichlet ) . secondly we show that in 2d isolas exist when periodic boundary conditions are used , and reconnect and then disconnect again as the cell to cell coupling parameter is increased .",
    "we also comment on ( i ) the overall bifurcation structure in 1d , ( ii ) the similarities between the 1d bifurcation structure and that of the continuum 1d swift  hohenberg model and ( iii ) the connections between 1d lattice structures and 2d lattice structures , using the former to explain features of the bifurcation diagram we obtain for the latter .",
    "the structure of the letter is as follows . in section  [ sec:1d ]",
    "we introduce the 1d lattice case and explore the bifurcation structure of localized states .",
    "we discuss the effects of different boundary conditions when the problem is restricted to a finite lattice . in section  [ sec:2d ]",
    "we consider a 2d lattice , highlight the new features that arise , and use the 1d results to explain aspects of the snaking curve .",
    "we summarise the main results of the paper in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "motivated by , after applying the rescaling @xmath6 , rescaling @xmath7 and @xmath8 appropriately , dropping the @xmath9 and adding a time derivative term appropriate for strongly dissipative rather than conservative dynamics , we consider the following equation posed on the integer lattice @xmath10 : [ eq:1d ] _",
    "n = c(u_n+1+u_n-1 - 2u_n ) + u_n + 2u_n^3 - u_n^5 , where @xmath5 is a real scalar variable defined at each lattice site , @xmath8 is the strength of linear coupling between adjacent sites , and @xmath11 is the primary ( real ) bifurcation parameter .",
    "the addition of a time derivative term is , of course , not necessary for the investigation of the existence of equilibrium states .",
    "however , it is a useful addition to indicate stability and to provide a contextual similarity to the studies of the swift  hohenberg equation in spatially continuous systems referred to above .",
    "if @xmath12 then we apply the parameter symmetry given by applying the ` staggering ' transformation [ eq : stagger ] u_n ( -1)^n u_n , c -c , - 4c , which leaves the equation unchanged , but switches the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "thus in this paper we will only consider positive @xmath8 , noting that the existence ( and stability ) of states @xmath13 with @xmath14 is equivalent to the existence ( and stability ) of states @xmath15 when @xmath12 and @xmath7 is shifted as in  ( [ eq : stagger ] ) .",
    "importantly , and in common with the swift  hohenberg equation , equation   is a gradient flow , that is , we can write @xmath16 where the potential @xmath17 is given by f(u ) = _ n c ( u_n+1-u_n)^2 - u_n^2 - u_n^4 + u_n^6 .",
    "thus @xmath18 , so that every solution of   flows down gradients of the potential toward an equilibrium solution , and every stable equilibrium state is a local minimum of the potential .",
    "no periodic or complex dynamics are therefore possible .",
    "there are five homogeneous equilibria : the trivial state @xmath19 , and four non - trivial equilibria @xmath20 , where u_^2 = 1 .",
    "the state @xmath19 is linearly stable for @xmath21 and unstable for @xmath22 .",
    "taking the positive square roots , the lower uniform state @xmath23 exists in @xmath11 and is always unstable , and the upper uniform state @xmath24 exists in @xmath25 and is always stable ; there is a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath26 .",
    "the per - cell potential for a homogeneous equilibrium @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 .",
    "since the system acts to minimize the total potential , the relative values of potential at the homogeneous equilibria are important .",
    "the trivial state has zero potential , and the potential of the upper state @xmath29 depends only on @xmath7 . by looking for a double root of @xmath30",
    "we find that the upper state has zero potential when @xmath31 ; this is the so - called _ maxwell point _ at which the upper uniform state and the trivial state are energetically equal .",
    "when @xmath32 the upper state is energetically more favourable ; when @xmath33 the trivial state is energetically more favourable .      in many physical applications",
    "it is appropriate to consider posed on a finite grid @xmath34 with boundary conditions specified with the aid of ` ghost cells ' @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "there are three obvious choices : periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) for which @xmath37 and @xmath38 , neumann boundary conditions ( nbc ) for which @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and dirichlet boundary conditions ( dbc ) for which @xmath41 .    with pbc or nbc",
    "the homogeneous state is an equilibrium configuration . with dbc",
    "this is not the case and this obvious difference leads us to focus in this discussion only on pbc and nbc : we find there are substantial differences between these two cases that require some discussion .",
    "equation posed on the infinite integer lattice has a symmetry group generated by the independent operations of translation @xmath42 , reflection @xmath43 and an up - down symmetry @xmath44 ( since the nonlinearity is an odd function of @xmath5 ) : : u_nu_n+1 , : u_nu_-n,:u_n - u_n .",
    "thus the full symmetry group of the infinite lattice problem is @xmath45 . posing the equation on a finite lattice implies changes in the symmetry group .",
    "consider the following actions of the elements @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 : : u_nu_n+1(n ) , : u_nu_n+1-n,:u_n - u_n .",
    "with pbc the translation subgroup @xmath10 , generated by @xmath42 , is simply replaced with the cyclic group @xmath46 so that the full symmetry group is @xmath47 . with nbc or dbc",
    "we lose translation symmetry entirely , so the symmetry group becomes @xmath48 .",
    "we will be particularly interested in localized solutions to   which lie in @xmath49 or @xmath50 , which are symmetric under reflection either about a lattice point , or about a point halfway between two lattice points .",
    "we refer to such solutions _ site - centred _ and _ bond - centred_. when @xmath51 is even , site - centred solutions lie in @xmath50 and bond - centred solutions lie in @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath51 is odd , site - centred solutions lie in @xmath49 and bond - centred solutions lie in @xmath50 .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath52 and eigenvalues @xmath53 of the discrete laplacian , obtained by solving @xmath54 on an @xmath51-cell lattice with pbc are easily computed to be @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "thus the zero state undergoes an instability to a mode with ` wavenumber ' parameter @xmath59 when @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath14 the first instability encountered when increasing @xmath7 is a bifurcation to the lower uniform state @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",

    "in contrast , the lower state @xmath61 has many secondary bifurcation points , occuring at = _ k^-- c^2(_k/2 ) , [ eq : instability ] for values of @xmath1 such that the expression under the square root is positive",
    ". the bifurcations are supercritical ` double pitchforks ' , each creating two new bifurcating branches of ` odd ' and ` even ' modulated states which develop into single- and multi - pulse localized states , each of which terminates on @xmath61 at both ends . in figure  [ fig:1dsnake ]",
    "only the single pulse branches are shown for clarity .",
    "this behaviour of secondary bifurcation creating branches of odd and even - symmetric modulated and localized states is extremely similar to that given for the continuum swift ",
    "hohenberg equation in @xcite without the additional complexity that arises from continuous changes of wavenumber along the branch which is prohibited in the present case by the spatial discreteness .",
    "noting that the instability creating single - pulse localized states is the @xmath65 branch , inspection of  ( [ eq : instability ] ) shows that the @xmath65 case is the last instability to remain as @xmath8 increases at fixed @xmath51 .",
    "hence the maximum coupling strength above which there are no modulational instabilities of @xmath61 is @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "@xmath67 therefore also provides an upper bound on the lower limit of the range of @xmath8 over which localized states asymptotic to zero may exist .",
    "we use the numerical continuation program  to explore the bifurcation structure of localized solutions to using both pbc and nbc .",
    "stability results come directly from , since is simply a collection of odes .    with pbc",
    "the bifurcation diagram figure  [ fig:1dsnake ] closely resembles the homoclinic snaking picture for the swift  hohenberg equation in a finite domain , with branches of localized solutions emerging from the uniform branch at @xmath68 and turning around in a succession of fold bifurcations to form two intertwined snakes of localized structures , one of site - centred and one of bond - centred solutions , before reconnecting to the uniform branch at @xmath69 . for @xmath51 even , as is the case in figure [ fig:1dsnake ] , these solutions lie in @xmath50 and @xmath49 respectively ; this is shown clearly in figure  [ fig:1dprofiles ] .",
    "again , just as in the continuum swift ",
    "hohenberg equation , the two snaking branches are connected by ` ladders ' of asymmetric structures : the ladders comprise solutions with no symmetry at all that are always unstable .",
    "these branches bifurcate subcritically from the main snake , at locations near to the fold bifurcations making up the main body of the snake ( not shown in figure [ fig:1dsnake ] ) .",
    "solution profiles at the lowest ( in terms of @xmath70 norm ) six right - hand saddle nodes are shown in figure [ fig:1dprofiles ] .",
    "plane : @xmath71-cell localized state ( red ) , @xmath72-cell ( green ) and @xmath73-cell ( magenta ) .",
    "the front solution is indicated by the blue curves : on an infinite lattice the edges of the snaking region asymptote to these curves as the width of the localized state increases .",
    "the vertical dashed line is the maxwell point @xmath74 for reference .",
    "results obtained for @xmath75.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      with pbc the bifurcation structure of the discrete model exactly parallels that of the continuous bistable swift - hohenberg equation . when we switch to nbc one of the snaking branches persists but the other fragments into a series of isolas ( closed curves of equilibria that no longer connect up into a snake ) and ` bubbles ' ( curves of equilibria that begin and end in bifurcations from the persistent snaking curve ) . in figure  [ fig:1dsnake ]",
    "the persistent snaking branch is indicated in black , isolas are indicated by the red curves and the bubbles are shown in blue . for @xmath51 even , the persistent snaking curve consists of bond - centred states with symmetry @xmath49 .",
    "the two halves of the pitchfork bifurcation where the bond - centred states bifurcate from the uniform state are no longer related by symmetry : in figure  [ fig:1dsnake](b ) we show the branch corresponding to states that are localized in the centre of the lattice rather than at the edges of the lattice .",
    "the snaking curve of site - centred states in figure  [ fig:1dsnake](a ) breaks up in figure  [ fig:1dsnake](b ) into isolas and bubbles which do not directly interact . in figure",
    "[ fig:1dsnake](b ) the lowest isola approaches the bifurcation point where the bond - centred branch connects to the uniform branch but does not bifurcate from either . as the @xmath76 norm increases , isolas alternate with bubbles which do bifurcate from the bond - centred snaking branch .",
    "the bubbles bifurcate from points close to where the ` ladders ' bifurcate in figure  [ fig:1dsnake](a ) and lack symmetry : in fact they comprise states which evolve smoothly from the exactly bond - centred state on the snaking curve and become very close to the subspace @xmath50 before moving back towards @xmath49 and reconnecting with the snaking branch further up .",
    "moreover there are , properly speaking , four copies of each isola and bubble branch of site - centred asymmetric localized states , related by the symmetries @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "this behaviour mimics what has been observed for the swift  hohenberg equation with non - periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it is important to note however , that in contrast with these investigations , the domain size can not be used as a continuously varying parameter in the present context .",
    "in fact , we anticipate that increasing @xmath51 by unity reverses the roles of the bond - centred and site - centred solutions when the boundary conditions are left unchanged .",
    "for example , with nbc as we consider here , when @xmath51 is odd we expect the site - centred snaking curve to persist and the bond - centred one to fragment into isolas and bubbles in a manner similar to that shown in figure  [ fig:1dsnake ] .",
    "in two dimensions our interpretation of  ( [ eqn : ac ] ) must be modified since there are additional possibilities for the coupling terms . on the square lattice @xmath77",
    "there are two natural nearest - neighbour difference operators : @xmath78 this leads to the following 2d generalization of  ( [ eq:1d ] ) [ eq:2d ] _ nm = c^+u_nm + c^u_nm + u_nm + 2u_nm^3 - u_nm^5 , where there are now two coupling parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the coefficients of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) coupling . as in the 1d case ,  ( [ eq:2d ] ) is variational .",
    "for this equation our primary interest is in establishing that even with pbc there are isolas containing stable localized states .",
    "therefore , we confine our presentation to localized solutions that are far from the lower and upper ends of the snake where reconnection to the uniform state occurs in a finite domain . to further simplify the discussion we set @xmath81 for the majority of this letter .",
    "clearly it is of interest to investigate how the snaking structure evolves with @xmath80 nonzero , and we will return to this and other issues in subsequent work .    ,",

    "it is not at all clear theoretically how the well - established theory for homoclinic snaking in 1d extends to 2d since there does not appear to be an analogous paradigm to the spatial dynamics approach .",
    "however , numerical computations show that the bifurcation diagram for localized states contains qualitative similarities ( see figure  [ fig:2dsnake ] ) .",
    "we remark that to generate this figure our computations were carried out using  on a @xmath85 grid . to accelerate the computation we simulated only a quarter of the domain , using appropriate ` reflecting ' boundary conditions to ensure that the new states generated were bond centred .",
    "this imposed symmetry implies that bifurcations to asymmetric ` ladder ' states could not be detected .",
    "other computations indicate that such bifurcations exist , and we will discuss the existence of asymmetric states elsewhere .",
    "the states shown in figure  [ fig : bond - centred ] lie on the snaking curve shown in figure  [ fig:2dsnake](b ) in which the bifurcation parameter @xmath7 is plotted on the vertical axis and the solution measure @xmath86 on the horizontal axis .",
    "@xmath83 is a scaled version of the @xmath76 norm defined as : @xmath87 use of the solution measure @xmath83 confers the advantage that at low coupling strengths it measures the ( near - integer ) number of cells that are ` active ' in the localized state .",
    "figure  [ fig:2dsnake](a ) indicates that ` high peaks ' ( e.g. the saddle - nodes labelled ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) and ( f ) at which the value of @xmath7 is markedly less negative than at most saddle - nodes ) are closely aligned with even integer values of @xmath83 .",
    "these labels correspond to the labelled localized states in figure  [ fig : bond - centred ] that are in the form of complete @xmath88 square arrays of active cells .",
    "the evolution of bond - centred localized states as we move up the snaking curve is shown in figure  [ fig : bond - centred ] .",
    "starting from  [ fig : bond - centred](a ) in which four cells are close to @xmath29 and the rest are near zero , new @xmath29 cells are added to the solution profile starting in the centre of the faces , and then progressing outwards towards the corners until the profile is square , at which point the sequence repeats itself .",
    "numerical continuation suggests that it is possible to proceed arbitrarily far up the snaking curve in this manner as long as the coupling coefficient is sufficiently small .",
    "there are similar snaking curves of site - centred and hybrid localized states which for brevity , and because they are not central to our discussion of isolas , we will not discuss here .",
    "the horizontal lines in each part of figure  [ fig:2dsnake ] indicate the locations of saddle - node bifurcations far up the 1d snake for two values of the coupling coefficient : @xmath89 ( red ) and @xmath90 ( blue ) .",
    "these values are determined from the part of the blue curve in figure  [ fig : muc ] which lies in @xmath91 .    at small coupling strengths it is clear numerically in figure  [ fig:2dsnake](a ) that , as @xmath86 increases and we move far up the snaking curve , the width of the snaking region is given overall by @xmath92 since the existence of square @xmath88 arrays of localized states is determined by the existence of stationary fronts aligned with a lattice direction .",
    "this is easy to see from the lattice equations  [ eq:2d ] ) by removing the dependence on the second coordinate @xmath93 , i.e. setting @xmath94 we recover  ( [ eq:1d ] ) with @xmath95 .",
    "all other saddle - node bifurcations involve localized states which are not complete squares and therefore involve stationary diagonal fronts between @xmath29 and zero . substituting the ansatz @xmath96 where @xmath97 into  ( [ eq:2d ] ) we obtain [ eq:2dreduced ] _",
    "= 2c^+(u_+1+u_-1 - 2u _ ) + c^(u_+2+u_-2 - 2u _ ) + u_+ 2u_^3 - u_^5 .",
    "hence , in the case @xmath81 this reduces exactly to  ( [ eq:1d ] ) with @xmath98 . when @xmath99 and the coupling coefficients are small ( and hence the front is sharp compared to the lattice spacing ) we anticipate that @xmath100 on one side of the front and @xmath101 on the other and so  ( [ eq:2dreduced ] ) can be well approximated by  ( [ eq:1d ] ) setting @xmath102 .",
    "figure  [ fig:2dsnake](d ) shows the bond - centred snake with @xmath103 and @xmath104 . qualitatively there is little difference between this and parts ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we observe two distinct scales in the bifurcation diagram , with the widths of turns on the snake corresponding roughly to those in the 1d model with @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "we anticipate that for @xmath80 small compared with @xmath79 there will be no significant differences from the @xmath81 case , but numerical continuation suggests that larger @xmath80 can alter the snaking curve significantly , especially when @xmath105 .",
    "we should also note that with two independent coupling parameters there is no equivalent to the staggering transformation presented for the 1d model .      as the coupling strength @xmath79 increases the snaking curves qualitatively",
    "depart from the 1d case due to the existence of regions in the bifurcation diagram where the snaking curve turns back on itself and the @xmath76 norm ( or , equivalently , @xmath83 ) of the localized state descreases for a number of twists before turning back again and continuing to snake upwards .",
    "we refer to such an episode as a ` switchback ' .",
    "examples of switchbacks are shown in figure  [ fig:2dsnakecloseups ] . in part",
    "( a ) of figure  [ fig:2dsnake ] switchbacks are observed to begin only at @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in",
    "( b ) an additional switchback appears at @xmath109 . in ( c )",
    "almost all the twists in the switchbacks have disappeared , although the bifurcation curves near @xmath110 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 show clear similarities .",
    "we find that the appearance and disappearance of switchbacks as the coupling strength @xmath79 is varied can be explained by collisions between solution curves in the bifurcation diagram .",
    "when @xmath79 is small it is important to note that there are many localized solutions to possessing square symmetry which do not appear on the snaking curve , e.g. as shown in figure  [ fig : switchback](a ) .",
    "these additional localized states exist on isolas in the bifurcation diagram . as @xmath79",
    "is increased these isolas collide with the snaking branch and form a switchback .",
    "assuming , as is reasonable at low coupling strength , that the isola contained a stable solution , the snaking curve will now contain ( at least ) one extra stable solution , by which we mean a localized state now present , but not present on the snake at lower @xmath79 .",
    "as @xmath79 is increased still further the snake narrows .",
    "intriguingly , and unexpectedly , the switchback may detach itself from the snake as @xmath79 is increased further , re - forming a disconnected isola .",
    "figure  [ fig : switchback ] illustrates these events with a sequence of bifurcation diagrams in the @xmath111 plane .",
    "the processes of attachment and detachment are facilitated by cusp singularities in which pairs of saddle - nodes on the snake collide and disappear as the coupling strength increases .",
    "figure  [ fig : detachment ] shows the cusp bifurcations in the @xmath112 plane corresponding to the attachment and detachment of the isola near @xmath113 shown in figure  [ fig:2dsnakecloseups](a ) and figure  [ fig : switchback ] .    in summary",
    ", these isolas provide a mechanism by which additional turns can be added to the snake , and they explain the unintuitive switchback episodes of the snaking curve as the localized states increase in size .",
    "this process of isola attachment and detachment typically occurs over a remarkably small range of @xmath79 , indicated by the vertical scales in figure  [ fig : detachment ] . at larger @xmath76 norms the complete bifurcation diagram in the @xmath112 plane is complicated since many isolas attach and detach from the snake at nearby values of @xmath79 .",
    "plane by following limit points : on the left an isola attaches itself to the snake as @xmath79 is increased , briefly creating a situation with three limit points , two of which disappear in a cusp singularity [ corresponding to fig .",

    "in this letter we have discussed the bifurcation structure of a model lattice equation , the discrete allen - cahn equation with cubic and quintic nonlinearities , in one and two dimensions .",
    "this equation is of interest in its own right as a model for spatially discrete pattern formation as well as being closely related to coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations which have received substantial recent attention in nonlinear optics .",
    "a subcritical instability of the trivial state , and the resulting bistability , leads to the creation of localized states which are stable over an open interval of the parameter @xmath7 , stabilized by being pinned to the lattice . as remarked on by previous authors ,",
    "these localized states arrange themselves into homoclinic snaking curves . in a finite domain we demonstrated the existence of a maximum coupling strength",
    "above which there is no modulational secondary instability which would allow creation of localized states : in systems with a sufficiently large coupling strength localized states do not appear .    in 1d we showed that breaking discrete translational symmetry , for example by using neumann boundary conditions , allows one of the snakes to persist , but cuases the other to fragment into a sequence of isolas and bubbles ( ` s'shaped curves bifurcating from the persistent snake ) .",
    "this contrasts with the situation in 2d where isolas exist even when discrete translational symmetry is not broken .",
    "these isolas attach and detach themselves from the primary snaking curve as the linear coupling strength is varied , creating kinks in the snaking curve , where the solution norm decreases along a part of the curve before beginning to increase again , that we refer to as ` switchbacks ' .",
    "numerical investigations suggest quantitative relations between the widths of the snaking curves in 1d and 2d . for wide localized states in 2d",
    "the values of @xmath7 that limit the region over which localized states exist correspond to the limiting values for fronts aligned with lattice directions or on the diagonal .",
    "this is the natural interpretation and agrees with the observations and computations by lloyd et al .",
    "@xcite for localized patches of hexagons in the 2d swift  hohenberg equation .",
    "this correspondance between 1d and 2d is asymptotically exact in the limit of small coupling coefficients : higher - order corrections arise at non - zero coupling and from the corners of the wide localized state where the fronts meet .",
    "our results are closely related to the work of carretero - gonzles and chong et al .",
    "@xcite on the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation with cubic and quintic nonlinearities .",
    "they discussed the time - independent allen - cahn equation from a spatial dynamics viewpoint , explaining the one - dimensional snaking curve as arising from intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds of a hyperbolic fixed point in a two - dimensional map .",
    "they also explored a variational approach , minimizing an effective lagrangian to give approximate localized states in one and two dimensions .",
    "our work considers additional mechanisms that complicate the usual snaking picture by causing isolas to appear : these include the effect of boundary conditions in 1d and exploring larger localized states , higher up the snaking curve in 2d where new effects , including the switchbacks , arise .",
