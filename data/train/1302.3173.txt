    "despite the numerous efforts undertaken to understand convection in stars , the treatment of this process in stellar modelling is still rather simplistic and one of the major uncertainties affecting the predictions of stellar evolution theory . in particular , whilst convection is a highly non - local phenomenon , the extension of the convective region is determined by local criteria such as schwarzschild and ledoux ones . nowadays , there are clear evidences that the current description of convection is unsatisfactory : numerical simulations , laboratory experiments , and disagreement between theoretical predictions and observations .",
    "for instance , mixing beyond the convective core formal limit during main sequence ( ms ) is needed to reproduce the morphology of color - magnitude diagrams of stellar cluster and the properties of binary systems ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , observational evidences suggest that the extension of the central mixed region during the core he - burning phase should be larger than determined by the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "in fact , this extension has important consequences on the duration of the he - b phase , but also in the following evolutionary phases , determining , for instance , the ratio between asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and horizontal branch ( hb ) stars .",
    "moreover , the different chemical profiles of c and o from different kind of mixing directly affect the oxygen abundance of white dwarfs ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the nature of the mechanism(s ) inducing extra - mixing , both in ms and he - b phases , as well as its extension are still debated ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "stellar seismology tries to answer some of these questions by looking for seismic indexes based on different oscillation modes and asymptotic relationships , or deviations with respect to them ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "in this context , the most powerful diagnostics are those based on oscillation modes that propagate close to the central region . in particular gravity modes ( g - modes ) and mixed gravity - pressure modes .",
    "some of these seismic indexes were successfully applied to individual stars showing different kind of pulsations : solar - like oscillations in ms stars and sub - giants @xcite and b - type pulsators @xcite .    here",
    ", we show that solar - like oscillation modes in g - k red giants ( rgs ) provide a most effective tool to test convective - core overshooting both during the main - sequence and the core - he - burning phase .",
    "moreover , thanks to @xmath3 and corot observations , such tests can potentially be performed on a large number ( thousands ) of stars encompassing a wide range of stellar parameters .",
    "the evolution of post - ms stars is characterised by a contracting he core and an expanding h - rich envelope , with a h - burning shell in between which becomes thinner and thinner as the star evolves on the rgb .",
    "the contracting core releases thermal energy , part of which is used to increase the temperature as long as the gas is not too degenerate , but which no longer produces heating in highly degenerate conditions . for a given he - core mass",
    "there is a maximum temperature that can be reached by core contraction as any further contraction leads to gas cooling .",
    "highly degenerate cores can not ignite helium burning if their mass is lower than about 0.475  .",
    "such stars keep ascending the rgb until their he cores reach this critical value ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    for total masses lower than about 2  , the he - core mass at the onset of the he flash and at the start of the post flash he - burning phase ( zaheb ) is thus about the same , i.e. @xmath40.475  . with the increase of the total mass ,",
    "the electron degeneracy level is lower and the he - core mass required for he burning decreases . after reaching a minimum value , the he - core mass increases again following the total mass , as a result of the larger and larger convective core mass during the ms phase ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "stars with the minimum he - core mass ( @xmath5  , the lowest mass for a pure he star to start he burning  see e.g. kippenhan and weigert 1990 ) define then a transition between two different behaviours of rg evolution @xcite .",
    "helium - burning stars with masses smaller than the transition stellar mass ( @xmath6 ) populate the so - called red clump ( rc , * ? ? ?",
    "since the luminosity of he - burning stars depends mainly on the he - core mass , the luminosity of rc stars is approximately constant , it rapidly decreases near the transition and then increases drastically as the total mass increases .",
    "the stellar mass at which the transition occurs depends on the he - core mass at the end of ms , hence on the chemical composition and on the amount of overshooting in the ms models .",
    "he - burning stars with masses close to the transition mass form the so - called secondary clump @xcite .",
    "the models presented in this paper were computed with the stellar evolution code aton @xcite .",
    "we followed the evolution from pre - main sequence to central he exhaustion of stellar models with masses from 0.7 to 4.0  , following the he - flash for low - mass models .",
    "figure  [ fig : modes ] ( upper panel ) shows the he - core mass at he - ignition as function of the stellar mass for models computed without and with core overshooting during the main sequence evolution . for the chemical composition considered ,",
    "the transition mass is 2.4  , while the value decreases to 2.2  for models with overshooting .",
    "a similar decrease is obtained by decreasing the metallicity by a factor of two .",
    "the properties of oscillation modes depend on the behaviour of the brunt - visl  ( @xmath7 ) and lamb ( @xmath8 ) frequencies .",
    "because of the high density contrast between the core and the envelope , the rg oscillation spectrum is characterised by a large number of mixed p - g modes in addition to the radial ones ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details )",
    ".    in rgs , once the temperature for he ignition is reached , convection appears in the nuclear burning core and is accompanied by the expansion of the star central regions .",
    "the core structure is , therefore , radically different from that of a rgb star , characterised by a high - density electron - degenerate radiative helium core ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : propag ] ) .",
    "both the presence of a convective core and the decrease of the density contrast ( @xmath9 ) determine significant changes in the brunt - visl frequency distribution near the core and , therefore , in the seismic properties of dipole modes @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic approximation for g - modes @xcite predicts that the periods of two modes of same degree ( @xmath10 ) and consecutive order ( @xmath11 ) are separated by a constant value @xmath12 :    @xmath13    in the he - burning ( he - b ) model the expansion of the central layers leads to a lower @xmath7 maximum , and its location is displaced at larger stellar radius .",
    "moreover , the central convective regions do not contribute to the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq_dp ] ( see fig . [",
    "fig : propag ] , upper panel , for a detailed description ) . the period spacing between consecutive g - modes , as determined from eq .",
    "[ eq_dp ] , is therefore significantly smaller in the rgb model ( @xmath14  s ) than in the he - b one ( @xmath15  s ) .",
    "the asymptotic approximation is , however , no longer valid for mixed modes ( those observed in rgs ) . for a detailed comparisons with the observations we compute therefore adiabatic oscillation frequencies , using the eulerian version of the code losc @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : propag ] where we plot the mode inertia of radial and dipole modes , as a function of the frequencies , as well as the period separation between dipole modes of consecutive radial order @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition to a significant difference in the period spacing itself , the differences between the spectra can be summarised as follows : _",
    "i ) _ in the rgb model the inertia of @xmath17 pressure - dominated modes ( corresponding to local minima in @xmath18 ) is closer to that of the radial models , indicating a weaker coupling between gravity and acoustic cavities compared to the he - b phase .",
    "this is also evident from the gravity - dominated modes of rgb , for which @xmath0 is almost constant ( as expected for pure g - modes ) except for the modes describing the minimum of inertia , while for the g - p mixed modes of the he - b model the deviation of @xmath0 from a constant value is more important . _",
    "ii ) _ the density of @xmath17 modes for the he - b model is lower than for the rgb one ( by a factor of 3 for the models shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : propag ] ) .    to compare theoretical predictions and observational results",
    "it is mandatory to define theoretical indexes as close as possible to the observational ones . to derive the average period spacing equivalent to that measured in @xcite and @xcite we should identify , among all the theoretical modes , those that are most likely to be observed , and thus contribute to the observed period spacing value",
    "that would require non - adiabatic computations , which are very time consuming and unfeasible for the large number of models considered in this study .",
    "moreover , from a theoretical point of view , the detectability of mixed modes not only depends on the models ( stellar structure and time - dependent convection ) which are subject to uncertainties , but it also strongly depends on the duration of observations @xcite and to a lower extent on the instrument . therefore ,",
    "following an adiabatic approach , we consider the modes with lower inertia as those most likely to be detected . these are also the modes contributing to significant deviations from the uniform @xmath0 predicted by the asymptotic approximation ( minima in @xmath0 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : propag ] , lower panels ) .",
    "we define @xmath19 , a theoretical estimation of the measurable period spacing from observed oscillation spectra , following the same procedure as in @xcite and based on the properties of observed oscillation spectra .",
    "we select oscillation modes with angular degree @xmath20 , and 1 and with frequencies @xmath21 in the expected solar - like domain , defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23hz . around each pressure - dominated dipole mode",
    "we consider the values @xmath24 involving @xmath25 modes with frequency lower and higher than that of the inertia minimum .",
    "our choice ( @xmath26 ) is based on current observations ( 3 or 4 values for each radial order ) .",
    "the @xmath24 s obtained in this way are then averaged in the solar - like frequency domain to obtain @xmath19 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath19 as a function of the average large frequency separation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpdnu ] for models in the rgb and in the central he - b phase with different chemical composition .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the recent observational results obtained with _ kepler _ and corot , where the clear difference between the period spacing of rgb and he - b models allowed us to use @xmath27 to identify the evolutionary state of red giants with comparable @xmath28 or @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "both the predicted and observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) period spacing show significant scatter in he - b stars .",
    "this dispersion is partly due to the different mass of the stars , chemical composition , and central helium mass fraction ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "@xcite identified the high-@xmath31low-@xmath0 tail as corresponding to the secondary clump , and we will show here that asymptotic and `` measurable '' values of the period spacing contain additional information on the structure and previous evolution of the star .",
    "@xmath32 depends mainly on the value of the @xmath33 ( density contrast ) , on the dimension of the convective core , and on the location of the h - shell which gives rise to a local maximum of @xmath7 .",
    "all these quantities change during the he - b phase and they do it differently depending on the stellar mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] ( black dots in central panel ) we plot @xmath32 for models with masses between 0.7 and 3.5  during the he - b phase as a function of the stellar mass . by comparison with the corresponding curve of the upper panel",
    ", it seems evident there is a direct correlation between @xmath32 and the mass of the he - core .",
    "@xmath32 is almost constant for low mass stars that begin to burn he in a degenerate core of  0.475  , and presents a minimum at the transition mass , which corresponds also to the minimum of he - mass core ( @xmath5 ) . for higher masses",
    ", @xmath32 increases with the stellar mass , such as the mass of the he - core ( @xmath34 at the end of ms ) .    @xmath35",
    "as described in the previous section , involves additional information related to the coupling between acoustic and gravity cavities , and hence depends on the properties of the evanescent region which can be characterised , roughly speaking , by the value of the integral @xmath36 in the region between the he - core and the envelope .",
    "the gray dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] ( central panel ) represent the corresponding values of @xmath35 for models during the he - b phase .",
    "the difference between asymptotic and `` observable '' values also depends on the stellar mass for low - mass models .",
    "that should not be surprising since the central density of models with 0.7  and 1.5  , their he - core mass and total radius are almost the same , which leads to a very different density ( and temperature ) distributions in their envelope , and hence to a very different coupling .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a clear dependence of @xmath35 on the he - core mass .",
    "@xmath35 like @xmath37 presents a minimum corresponding to @xmath38 , whose value strongly depends on the extension of mixed central region during the ms . in fig .",
    "[ fig : over ] we plot the `` observable '' period spacing , for models with and without overshooting during the ms , as a function of the he - core mass .",
    "two linear relationships appear between @xmath35 and @xmath1 : the first for low - mass rgb models with @xmath0 decreasing as @xmath1 increases due to the larger contrast density as the star evolves , the second one for he - b models . for the latter ,",
    "both families of models follow the same relation , the only difference being the mass of the models occupying the same location in that diagram .    in the framework of adiabatic calculations ,",
    "that is assuming the amplitude of modes directly linked to @xmath39 , we use the ratio between the inertia of a mixed mode and that of the corresponding pressure - dominated one to flag that mode as detectable and thus contributing to the average period spacing value . that ratio depends on details of the stellar structure , and therefore on stellar parameters such as mass , age , and evolutionary state .",
    "in fact , we should expect to observe less mixed modes as the inertia ratio increases , which is the case for models with better trapped dipole modes .",
    "we are aware that this detectability limit is an arbitrary choice since the relation between inertia and amplitude is only a proxy , nevertheless the current available non - adiabatic computations confirm that assumption @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can expect more modes to be detected in longer time series , changing the value of @xmath0 obtained from the mean value of individual measured period spacings , and @xmath40 being an upper limit .    to see how our results depend on the choice of the detectability limit and on the number of mixed - modes considered as observables , we estimated @xmath19 changing these parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] we compare the results obtained for he - b models adopting @xmath26 and a limit value of the inertia ratio ( i.e. , the standard procedure used in this work in figs .",
    "[ fig : modes ] ,  [ fig : dpdnu ] , and  [ fig : over ] ) with the @xmath19 values that results when 4 mixed modes at lower and higher frequency of each pressure - dominate mode in the solar - like frequency domain are considered , and that without imposing any detectability limit .",
    "an additional increase of @xmath25 does not introduce noticeable changes on the behaviour of @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath19 for lowest mass models is only slightly affected , and that the more important effect is obtained for secondary clump models .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the case of secondary clump stars such a large number of detected mixed modes around the pressure - dominated ones allows us to derive @xmath0 as a function of frequency , and then do a detailed analysis of their stellar structure .",
    "we stress that for a theoretical interpretation of the observations it is mandatory to use definitions of theoretical and observational indexes as close as possible .",
    "that is true for @xmath19 , but also for @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "even if the specific values of @xmath19 may change with the number of mixed modes considered , a linear relation between @xmath19 and he - core mass remains .",
    "the @xmath25 value must be adapted to the current observations , i.e. , changing according to the duration of time series and instrument features .",
    "period spacing in he - b red giant stars provides a stringent test of the central mixing during the h - ms .",

    "the value of the asymptotic period spacing depends on the central distribution of @xmath7 , and hence on the size of the convective core .",
    "[ fig : dp_rcc ] shows @xmath44 as a function of convective - core radius for models in the he - b phase , with @xmath30 between 0.9 and 0.1 , and masses from 0.7 to 4.0 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : dp_rcc ] the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is , to a good approximation , linear .    for a given mass ,",
    "the trend of @xmath44 changes when @xmath46 due to the much lower temperature dependence of the nuclear reaction @xmath47 which , at that stage , becomes the dominant energy source in the core . for massive stars @xmath45 and @xmath44 decrease for models with @xmath48 because @xmath49 increases as he is exhausted .",
    "for models with @xmath50 the mass and radius of the convective core follow a linear relation , which however disappears when @xmath47 takes over the @xmath51 reaction : in that case @xmath52 increases even more quickly but @xmath45 decreases .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite showed that @xmath2 can be inferred from the observed period spacing of dipole mixed modes . checking the procedure with our theoretical frequencies for 1.5  models the he - b phase , we were able to recover the asymptotic period spacing with a precision of 2% when we take into consideration 68 mixed modes for each radial order , such as in @xcite ( see their fig .  2 ) .    a first comparison between the predictions of our models ( using eq .",
    "[ eq_dp ] ) and the values of @xmath44 derived by @xcite for a sample of _ kepler _ giants is shown in fig .",

    "all these models were computed without extra - mixing during the ms and during the he - b phases .",

    "we should decrease the contribution of @xmath7 in the innermost regions of the star , which can be easily done by extending the adiabatically stratified and chemically homogeneous core .",
    "we computed stellar models and oscillation frequencies for @xmath55  with central extra - mixing during the he - b evolution described by an instantaneous and adiabatic overshooting of length @xmath56 . as expected , both the asymptotic and the minimum values of period spacing increase as the size of homogeneous core increases . in fig .",

    "note that the last values ( @xmath44 and @xmath60 ) are similar to those of a 4.0  without overshooting .",
    "the exact @xmath44 value depends on the extension of the extra - mixed region , but also on the details of the mechanism at the origin of different @xmath7 profiles : a mechanical overshooting with adiabatic temperature gradient in the extra - mixed region , or an induced overshooting with a semi - convective layer outside the convective core .",
    "the latter will provide , for the same extension of the adiabatic region , a smaller period spacing than the former .",
    "the behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp_rcc ] for @xmath61 is also found for different metallicities .",

    "similar results were found using the mesa code @xcite , considering models with and without overshooting during the he - b phase .",
    "from the computation of stellar models with masses from 0.7 to 4.0  and from the study of their adiabatic oscillation spectra , we find a good agreement between theoretical and observational behaviour of period spacing .",
    "we also show the potential of dipole - mode period spacing in rgs to constrain the extension of central extra - mixing during the h- and he - central burning phases :    * the `` observed '' period spacing of stars with masses close to the transition value ( 1.8 - 2.4  depending on chemical composition and mixing ) presents an almost linear relation with the he - core mass and , therefore , contains information on the extension of the convective core during the h - ms .",
    "these stars define the so - called `` secondary clump '' , and the value of their mass has been identified as the best index of the mixing processes during the ms in stellar clusters@xcite .",
    "currently , seismology allows us to derive mass and secondary clump membership for a huge number of field rgs .",
    "nevertheless , a fruitful exploitation of the enormous potential of seismic properties , allowing the comparison of observational results with predictions from synthetic stellar populations models , would also require information on chemical composition .",
    "so , a theoretical @xmath35 as function of the total mass , initial chemical composition ( @xmath63 ) and evolutionary state ( @xmath30 or @xmath1 ) will provide the expected @xmath35 distribution for synthetic stellar populations .",
    "its comparison with observed distributions will shed some light on the mixing processes during the h - ms .",
    "it is also worth recalling that stars in the secondary clump spend long time in the he - b phase , and that their ages depend mainly on the ms extra - mixing ( 38% larger for stars with ms overshooting ) but are chemical composition independent @xcite . *",
    "the seismic properties of stars in the red clump seem independent of core extra - mixing during ms , as low - mass stars reach the same kind of structure at he ignition .",
    "we have shown , however , that a linear relation exists between the asymptotic period spacing of dipole modes and the extension of the convective core in the he - b phase .",
    "non extra - mixing he - b models predict @xmath6420% smaller than values inferred from observations .",

    "a more direct comparison between models and observations shall be carried out , and will provide information not only on the extension of the central mixed region , but also on the detailed properties of the chemical composition gradient inside the star ."
