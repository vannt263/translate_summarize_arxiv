    "inflation is one of the most important achievements in modern cosmology[1 ] . it has became the standard scenario for the early universe since it has the potential to solve some outstanding problems present in the standard hot big - bang cosmology .",
    "more importantly , it produces the cosmological fluctuations for the formation of the structure that we observe today . despite the great successes of inflation paradigm ,",
    "there are several serious problems with no concrete solutions ; natural realization of inflation in a fundamental theory , cosmological constant and dark energy problem , unexpected low power spectrum at large scales and egregious running of spectral index are some of these problems ( for a list of theoretical problems in inflation paradigm , see [ 2 ] ) .",
    "another unsolved problem in the spirit of inflationary scenario is that we do not know how to integrate it with ideas in particle physics .",
    "for example , we would like to identify the inflaton , the scalar field that drives inflation , with one of the known fields of particle physics .",
    "furthermore , it is important that the inflaton potential emerges naturally from underling fundamental theory[3 ] .    in the spirit of the braneworld scenarios ,",
    "there are promising evidences to overcome some of these difficulties .",
    "brane models are inspired from m / string theory and branes are topological solitons in nonperturbative m / string theories in @xmath0 or @xmath1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "as horava and witten have shown , gauge fields of the standard model are confined on two @xmath2-branes located at the end points of an @xmath3 orbifold[4 ] .",
    "based on the horava - witten model , the idea that our universe is a 3-brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime has received a great deal of attention in recent years(see [ 5 ] and references therein ) . in the braneworld scenario ,",
    "the standard model particles are confined on the 3-brane , while the gravitation can propagate in the whole space . since string theory claims to give us a fundamental description of the nature , it is important to study what kind of cosmology it predicts .",
    "furthermore , despite the fact that inflationary models have been analyzed in standard four - dimensional cosmology , it is challenging to discuss them in alternative gravitational theories such as brane gravity . among various braneworld scenarios ,",
    "the model proposed by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) [ 6 ] is different in this respect that it predicts deviations from the standard @xmath4-dimensional gravity even over large distances . in this scenario ,",
    "the transition between four and higher - dimensional gravitational potentials arises due to the presence of both the brane and bulk einstein terms in the action .",
    "existence of a higher dimensional embedding space allows for the existence of bulk or brane matter which can certainly influence the cosmological evolution on the brane . in the dgp model ,",
    "the bulk is a flat minkowski spacetime , but a reduced gravity term appears on the brane without tension .",
    "maeda , mizuno and torii have constructed a braneworld scenario which combines the randall - sundrum ii ( rs ii ) model and dgp model[7 ] . in this combination ,",
    "an induced curvature term appears on the brane in the rs ii model .",
    "this model has been called _ warped dgp braneworld _ in literature[8 ] .",
    "braneworld model with scalar field minimally or non - minimally coupled to gravity have been studied extensively(see[9 ] and references therein ) .",
    "the introduction of non - minimal coupling is not just a matter of taste ; it is forced upon us in many situations of physical and cosmological interests such as quantum corrections to the scalar field theory and its renormalizability in curved spacetime[10 ] . in the spirit of braneworld inflation scenario ,",
    "there are numerous studies which we highlight some of these studies based on their importance and relevance to present work . the chaotic inflation model on the rs",

    "in addition to these studies , there are several other extensive studies in braneworld inflation which can be obtained in literature(for a recent but uncomplete list see[19 ] ) . here",
    "we are going to investigate non - minimal inflation in warped dgp braneworld . in this direction , inflation model with _ minimally coupled _",
    "scalar field on the warped dgp braneworld has been studied by cai and zhang[8 ] .",
    "recently , non - minimal inflation and running of the spectral index have been studied by li in usual 4-dimensional spacetime[20 ] .",
    "this study which is restricted to 4-dimensional cosmology , has been extended to high derivative coupling by chen _",
    "et al_[21 ] .",
    "the issue of non - minimal inflation on a warped dgp brane has not been studied yet and therefore our goal in this paper is to do this end to fill the existing gap .",
    "we study an inflation model on the warped dgp scenario where inflaton is non - minimally coupled to induced ricci scalar on the brane .",
    "we calculate parameters of our inflation model to study implications and predictions of the model .",
    "we assume inflation of the universe is driven by a single scalar field non - minimally coupled to induced gravity with exponential potential on the warped dgp brane .",
    "we show that the inflationary phase can exit spontaneously by a suitable choice of non - minimal coupling .",
    "as we will show , depending on the values of non - minimal coupling , the running of the scalar spectral index can take negative values , which is in agreement with high precision observations of wmap[22 ] .",
    "we study the constraints imposed on non - minimal coupling from observational data .",
    "as faraoni has shown , with non - minimal coupling it is harder to achieve inflation and accelerated expansion[10 ] .",
    "however , since inclusion of non - minimal coupling is forced upon us from quantum field theory considerations in curved space , it is interesting to study the effect of non - minimally coupled inflaton on a warped dgp brane .",

    "the energy scale of inflation for different values of non - minimal coupling will be discussed in the next section .",
    "+ before a detailed analysis of parameter space , we should stress that with non - minimal coupling of inflaton and curvature , one can perform a conformal transformation to a new metric for which the coupling of the inflaton to the metric becomes minimal(see for example [ 10 , 30 - 33 ] ) . in the new frame(einstein frame ) , the inflaton potential gets an additional term . as",

    "physical observable such as spectral index attain a new and complicated form depending on both warp factor and non - minimal coupling as follows @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136\\hspace{5cm}\\ ] ] in fact as has been shown in [ 30 ] , only for @xmath137 physical observables of inflation do not depend on @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , in our case both warp factor and observable quantities are different relative to minimal case and a frame ( conformal ) transformation alone can not relate our results to the results of minimal case studied in [ 8 ] .",

    "in which follows , in all numerical calculations and resulting figures we have set @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "to explore cosmological implications of this non - minimal inflation model , we perform some numerical analysis of parameter space",

    "as this figure shows , the situation for non - minimal case is different in some respects .",
    "for example , if @xmath74 , it is impossible to reach @xmath66 and therefore , there is no spontaneous exit from inflation with this non - minimal coupling within our framework . for negative larger values of non - minimal coupling",

    "figure @xmath77 shows the slow roll parameter @xmath141 versus @xmath107 for different values of non - minimal coupling on the branch @xmath76 of the warped dgp braneworld .",
    "as this figure shows , for small values of non - minimal coupling it is impossible to exit inflationary phase spontaneously and within reasonable time scale .",
    "however , for larger values of non - minimal coupling , in contrast to minimal case[8 ] , it is possible to exit from inflation spontaneously in branch @xmath76 with some values of the non - minimal coupling in a reasonable time scale .",
    "for instance , as figure @xmath142 shows , if we set @xmath143 or larger , it is possible to reach @xmath66 in this branch .",
    "this is one of the main differences between our model and the minimal model studied in [ 8 ] .",
    "figure @xmath4 shows the scalar spectrum index with @xmath68 . in minimal case , this index is always less than unity(red spectrum)[8 ] .",
    "we see that for negative non - minimal coupling it is possible to find scalar spectrum index larger than unity(a blue spectrum ) .",

    "in other words , non - minimal inflation can be supported by wmap3 data with running of spectral index .",
