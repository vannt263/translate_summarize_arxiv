    "the quarkonia produced in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions are considered as excellent effective probes of the strongly interacting medium and also proposed as a signature of deconfinement  @xcite .",
    "in such hot deconfined matter , the color screening dissolves the binding of the heavy quark anti - quark pair .",
    "this leads to the higher excited quarkonium states to dissolve at lower temperature .",
    "studying the suppression pattern of quarkonia in aa collisions ( where the plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected to form ) , along with the comparative quarkonia production in pp collisions will allow one to set an estimate of the initial temperature of the medium  @xcite .",
    "extensive experimental results at sps  @xcite(including feeddown from other less bound resonances like @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and rhic  @xcite of j/@xmath1 production in aa collisions clearly indicate that even the strong bound j/@xmath1 ground state is suppressed .",
    "however at large hadron collider(lhc ) energies the j/@xmath1 production could be even enhanced due to the coalescence of un - correlated @xmath7 pairs in the medium which can cause a regeneration  @xcite .",
    "initial state effects like modifications of the parton distribution functions in the nucleus relative to the nucleon ( also known as shadowing ) need to be taken in account  @xcite .",
    "the final state effects like nuclear absorption are expected to be practically irrelevant at lhc energies .",
    "studying the pa collisions at lhc energies is henceforth crucial to quantify the role of initial shadowing effects . using the muon spectrometer  @xcite",
    "charm and beauty particles can be measured in the forward rapidity region via its di - muon decay .",
    "the alice muon spectrometer physics program  @xcite is based on the measurement of heavy - flavor production in forward rapidity region ( @xmath0 ) for pp , pa and aa collisions at lhc energies .",
    "j/@xmath1 @xmath8 in pb+pb at @xmath2  tev as a function of @xmath9 compared with phenix results in au+au collisions at @xmath10  gev.,width=302 ]     j/@xmath1 @xmath11 as a function of centrality compared with atlas results .",
    "error bars represent the statistical uncertainties , open boxes show the centrality - dependent systematic uncertainties while the centrality independent uncertainties are represented by filled boxes.,width=302 ]",
    "the first pb+pb collisions were delivered by lhc at a centre of mass energy @xmath2  tev in the fall of 2010 at an un - explored regime of almost 14 times higher than top rhic energy .",
    "the results presented here are based on sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 @xmath12b@xmath13 .",
    "the nuclear modification factors defined as @xmath8 or @xmath11 allow us to quantify the medium effects on j/@xmath1 production .",
    "@xmath8 gives the deviation in j/@xmath1 yields from aa collisions relative to the scaled ( according to the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ) yields of j/@xmath1 from pp collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : raa ] shows the inclusive j/@xmath1 @xmath8 measured at forward rapidity(@xmath0 ) as a function of the average number of nucleons participating to the collision ( @xmath9 ) which has been calculated using the glauber model .",
    "@xmath9 has been weighted by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath14 ) due to the bias caused by large centrality bins .",
    "this correction is small , except for the most peripheral bin where @xmath9  =  46 while the weighted value is 70 .",
    "these results show weak centrality dependence and an integrated @xmath15 .",
    "comparison with the rhic measurements at @xmath10  gev  @xcite from the phenix experiment shows that the inclusive j/@xmath1 @xmath8 at 2.76  tev in the alice forward rapidity region are higher than that measured at 200  gev in the rapidity domain of @xmath16 .",
    "however , the midrapidity values at 200  gev ( except in the most central collisions ) are closer .",
    "the contribution from the b feed down to the j/@xmath1 production in our rapidity and @xmath17 domain has been measured and estimated to be @xmath18 in pp collisions at @xmath19  tev  @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 can provide similar information based on the relative yield in central(c ) and peripheral(p ) collisions scaled by the mean number of binary collisions , but does not depend on the reference pp system .",
    "figure  [ fig : rcp ] shows the alice forward rapidity measurements of j/@xmath1 @xmath11 results compared with the atlas measurements for the same centrality classes  @xcite .",
    "the j/@xmath1 mesons measured at forward rapidity down to @xmath20 are less suppressed than the high-@xmath17 j/@xmath1 mesons at midrapidity ( 80% of the j/@xmath1 particles measured by atlas have a @xmath17 larger than 6.5 gev/@xmath21 ) .",
    "nuclear modification factors @xmath8 or @xmath11 are measured in the first heavy - ion 2010 run of lhc . the inclusive j/@xmath1 production in pb+pb collisions at",
    "@xmath2  tev shows a notable suppression and no significant dependence on centrality . at central events ,",
    "a smaller suppression has been found compared to phenix results at rhic energies .",
    "the regeneration mechanism may explain these experimental results .",
    "the roles of the suppression and regeneration mechanisms could be disentangled by quantifying the initial shadowing effect with data from the forthcoming p+pb run at lhc , planned for late 2012 .",
