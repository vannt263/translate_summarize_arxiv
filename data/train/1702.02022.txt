    "the response of nanomaterials to alternating electromagnetic fields is of great importance nowadays in the biomedical field , where new approaches to treat diseases are under development",
    ". one of the most innovative and important applications is related to heat delivery through the interaction of nanomaterials with electromagnetic fields .",
    "this heat delivery method can be used to release drugs@xcite , activate biological processes@xcite and even treat tumors@xcite . indeed , using maxwell s equations and",
    "the first law of thermodynamics one finds that the heat loss per unit volume per cycle is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the nanomaterial volume , @xmath2 is the heat loss , @xmath3 the electric field , @xmath4 the free volumetric density current , @xmath5 the electric polarization , @xmath6 the vacuum magnetic permeability , @xmath7 the magnetization and @xmath8 the magnetic field .",
    "the first term in equation correspond to the `` free - current '' loss , whereas the last two describe dielectric and magnetic losses .",
    "moreover the `` free - current '' loss term has an important impact on the biomedical application since it is related to a biological constraint .",
    "this term states that the frequency ( @xmath9 ) and magnitude of the alternating magnetic fields need to be lower than a critical value in order to inhibit possibly harmful ionic currents in the patient s body@xcite .",
    "for instance , for a frequency of 100 khz the maximum field amplitude is in the order of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) for a single air - core coil radius of @xmath12 ( expected dimension for breast cancer application@xcite ) .",
    "note that this value is higher than the one usually reported ( order of @xmath13 ) only because the estimation of atkinson used a coil radius of @xmath14 . since the free current loss is proportional to the square of the distance from the coil axis , an estimation of the critical field for a given coil radius ( @xmath15 )",
    "might be obtained from @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the biological critical field as a function of field frequency in the usual therapeutic hyperthermia range using atkinson s criteria@xcite , which indicates that the higher the frequency the lower is this field ( the parameters used to generate the curve are presented in the figure captions ) .    on the other hand , the last terms of eq . , which represent hysteretic losses ,",
    "has been the subject of analytical models within the linear response theory ( lrt ) and was used to estimate optimal particle size , understand particle - particle interaction effects and maximum heat generation for hyperthermia@xcite .",
    "curiously , most lrt studies from the literature do not discuss a fundamental limitation of the model , namely , that it is only valid at the low particle size range and low field amplitudes .    in fig.[figure1",
    "] we show the range of validity of the lrt , which , as can be seen , is far below the typical fields used for hyperthermia studies .",
    "there are several suggestions for identifying this limit .",
    "for example , carrey et al.@xcite found that the hysteresis area for a longitudinal case ( field applied parallel to the easy axis - see fig .",
    "5(g ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) deviates from the lrt for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 - where @xmath19 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 is the temperature ) , which suggests that this model can only be applied for particles below a critical size . alternatively ,",
    "verde et al . suggested that deviations occurs for fields @xmath22(@xmath23 is the anisotropy field , that for uniaxial case is @xmath24 with @xmath25 the anisotropy constant)@xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that experimentally , it is possible to determine if one is still in the linear regime or not , by verifying if the the heating efficiency ( also known as specific loss power - slp ) scales quadratically with the field . throughout this manuscript , when discussing the theoretical models , low magnetic fields mean values within the lrt range .",
    "in addition , in fig . [ figure1 ] we also include an estimation of the range of validity of the nonlinear response model ( nlrt ) developed in this work , which will be shown later in the manuscript to be @xmath26 .",
    "this corresponds to a 7-fold increase in the range of field validity in comparison to the lrt definition used above .",
    "the result suggests that the model may be useful for biomedical applications , in particular for magnetic hyperthermia .    in the subject of heat loss ,",
    "the term `` nonlinear '' has been used in a variety of ways .",
    "for instance , nonlinear dielectric effects have been related to the correlation of distinct relaxation times@xcite . in this case , a superposition of debye processes is used , which predict heat loss scaling with the square of field amplitude .",
    "conversely , for relaxor ferroelectric materials a nonlinear polarization term is included in the dynamic response equation@xcite .",
    "such approach allowed the authors to investigate the third harmonics of the relaxor . on the other hand , in magnetic materials ,",
    "nonlinear response is investigated using the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( sllg ) equation@xcite . in this case ,",
    "thermal fluctuations are addressed using the brown s approach@xcite , where the giant spin hypothesis allow one to use the fokker - planck equation to the magnetic moment orientational distribution function .",
    "one can then show that this leads to an infinite hierarchy of equations , which can be solved numerically to find the magnetic moment response of the nanoparticle @xcite .",
    "the method is valid for any field amplitude , but due to its mathematical complexity , it does not yield simple analytical expressions that could be useful in the applied field .    indeed , the field and frequency - dependence of heat loss in magnetic materials have been attracting the attention for a long time due to technological applications @xcite . in general",
    ", the loss in magnetic materials can show several contributions , spanning from eddy currents ( that scales with @xmath27 ) , anomalous eddy current con- tributions ( due to complex domain wall dynamics which scales with @xmath28 ) up to multidomain magnetichys- teresis contribution .",
    "the later term can be explained us- ing the rayleigh correction to the magnetic permeability and reveals a power loss scaling with @xmath29 .",
    "curiously , this type of behavior had been reported before in mag- netic nanoparticle hyperthermia experiments @xcite .",
    "the authors suggest that this can be explained by the exis- tence of large particles in the sample @xcite .",
    "so , multi- domain particles could be relevant to heat generation through domain wall motion loss .",
    "however , for most used magnetic fluid samples , multidomain particles are not expected .",
    "for example , in magnetite nanoparticles the single - domain limit is around 80 nm @xcite .",
    "moreover , on the theoretical point of view , carrey et al .",
    "inves- tigated the slp field exponent using numerical simula- tions of the sllg equation ( see fig",
    ". 7 of ref .",
    "the authors found theoretically that this exponent is size de- pendent and showed values below or higher than 2 .",
    "this type of behavior was found experimentally by verde et al .",
    "however , in both works , no simple analytical expression was used to explain this behavior .    here",
    "we show that through a modification of bloch s equation , which is linear with respect to the magnetization , one is able to obtain a heat loss expression valid beyond the lrt . indeed , different from other works from the literature",
    ", we demonstrate that even the linear frequency term has higher order field contributions .",
    "also , our model introduces a nonlinear frequency term which adequately describes the magnetic response within the hyperthermia therapeutic window .",
    "the validity of the model is explicitly tested by comparing it with numerical simulations of the sllg approach .",
    "in addition , we included experimental magnetic hyperthermia data that supports our theoretical findings .",
    "twelve powder samples were studied , including cobalt - ferrite , copper - ferrite , nickel - ferrite , maghemite and manganese - ferrite ( doped with zn or co and also undoped ) based nanoparticles .",
    "the analytical nonlinear response model is believed to be useful not only for improving our understanding of magnetic losses , but also may impact other related areas , which could benefit from analytical expressions , as for example , magnetic particle imaging@xcite and magnetic nanothermometry@xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss several models from the literature . in particular",
    ", we present the linear response theory ( lrt ) , the nonlinear ferguson - krishnan model ( fk ) ( usually applied in magnetic particle imaging ) , the perturbation method developed by raikher and stepanov ( rs model ) , and finally the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert model , which is expected to be the exact solution of the magnetic response of the nanoparticle at alternating field conditions . all the models are critically compared showing the necessity of developing a simple nonlinear analytical model .",
    "the sllg model is than compared with the proposed nonlinear response model ( nlrt ) developed in section iii .",
    "section iv we present the experimental procedure , i.e. the synthesis and characterization of magnetic fluids . in section v we discuss all the theoretical and experimental results .",
    "here we focus on magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia , but also compare our model with the third - harmonic magnetic particle imaging data from the literature .",
    "finally , in section vi we summarize our findings .",
    "( expected for small tumors in breast @xcite ) , which results in a @xmath30 .",
    "human treatment can only occur below this field .",
    "the lrt limit is calculated assuming @xmath22 for a particle diameter of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the nonlinear response critical field for our model ( nlrt ) corresponds to the solid line . ]",
    "all the models discussed in this manuscript are valid within the single - domain range .",
    "also , they assume the giant - spin hypothesis of brown@xcite , i.e. coherent spin rotation . here",
    "we will consider the case of uniaxial magnetic nanoparticle , where the energy is given by @xmath37 the first term is the uniaxial anisotropy energy , while the other is the zeeman interaction .",
    "@xmath38 represents the angle between the magnetic moment of the nanoparticle and the easy axis direction , while @xmath39 corresponds to the angle between the magnetic dipole and the applied field .",
    "it is common to name the longitudinal case as @xmath40 , which is the case where the field is applied in the anisotropy axis direction .",
    "the simplest quasi - static magnetization model in the literature , named langevin model , neglects the anisotropy term , which can only be done if the ratio of this anisotropy contribution to the thermal energy is very low . in this case",
    "the magnetization can be calculated from @xmath41 @xmath42 is the langevin function , whose series expansion to fifth order gives @xmath43 the first term is the initial ( linear ) susceptibility , the second the cubic , and there on .",
    "the first linear response model to describe heat loss was probably described by debye in the context of rigid electric dipoles@xcite . here",
    "we focus in the magnetic case .",
    "let us first start by assuming that a magnetic particle is subjected to a harmonic field @xmath44 , with the magnetic susceptibility @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 corresponds to the real and imaginary linear susceptibility terms , respectively .",
    "so , the magnetization term can be written as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 with @xmath9 the field frequency . therefore , defining the heating efficiency ( slp ) as the frequency times the hysteresis loss divided by the particle density ( @xmath50 ) one finds @xmath51 this equation represents the heat loss of the magnetic material .",
    "so , one now needs an expression for the imaginary susceptibility term .",
    "if the projection of the magnetization , @xmath52 , in the field direction satisfies the bloch equation , i.e. @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the magnetization relaxation time , one can show the linear susceptibility term is @xmath55 , revealing that @xmath56 @xmath57 is the equilibrium susceptibility , which within the langevin model is equal to @xmath58 .",

    "this expression returns to the later in the absence of an applied field .",
    "the first one to describe this heat loss for magnetic fluids was rosensweig@xcite .",
    "the model above predicts a loss proportional to the square of the applied field .",
    "however , this is only true experimentally at low field amplitudes as found in several cases dealing with magnetic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "note that the same issue occurs in the electric case for dielectrics@xcite or relaxor ferroelectrics@xcite .",
    "in addition , the lrt model predicts elliptical magnetic hysteresis curves , which have been observed at low field amplitudes ( less than @xmath69 ) by eggeman et al .",
    "@xcite and tomitaka et al .",
    "however , this is not consistent with findings at higher field amplitudes , as for instance in magnetic particle imaging where a nonlinear response plays a crucial role @xcite .      in an attempt to include nonlinear phenomena in the description ,",
    "ferguson and krishnan@xcite proposed a generalization of linear magnetization , using the langevin function : @xmath70 this approach assumes that the frequency response of higher field order ( quasi - static ) terms are the same as the linear dynamic susceptibility term and neglects the quasi - static contribution from the magnetic anisotropy energy term .",
    "this expression is usually used to obtain the nth - order harmonic magnetization , which represents an important quantity in magnetic particle imaging @xcite .",
    "the harmonic calculation will be discussed in detail in section iii .",
    "using perturbation theory , raikher and stepanov@xcite , included the anisotropy term and showed that the magnetization could be written as @xmath71 .",
    "however , different from the fk model above , the frequency dependence of the cubic term was found to be different from the linear term .",
    "the authors found that the cubic susceptibility could be written as    @xmath72    where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the particle volume fraction of the assembly and @xmath75 .",
    "so , the real and imaginary susceptibility terms are given by @xmath76    @xmath77    using up to the cubic term the magnetization of the nanoparticle in the rs model gives @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , with @xmath81 and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are given by eq .",
    "[ eq : rechi3rs ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : imchi3rs ] .",
    "note that those expressions are valid for an ensemble and low field amplitudes . in order to obtain",
    "the equivalent expressions for the nanoparticle one only need to neglect the particle volume fraction in the equilibrium susceptibilities . because of the perturbation approach this model is expected to be valid only at very low field amplitudes .",
    "the model that is expected to correctly describe the magnetization response of a single - domain nanoparticle at any field amplitude and frequency range is the sllg model . in this case , the magnetic moment of the nanoparticle is assumed to be described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xmath84 where @xmath85 the effective field has three contributions : the applied external field , the anisotropy field and the thermal fluctuation field . so the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation for a magnetic dipole is augmented with a gaussian white noise thermal field @xmath86 whose cartesian coordinates satisfy the statistical properties : @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the kronecker and dirac deltas indicates that the thermal field is both spatial and temporally uncorrelated . in principle",

    "however , the approach of brown was to connect the sllg equation to the fokker - planck equation of the magnetic moment orientational distribution function @xcite , which can be used to obtain the nanoparticle magnetic moment response .    in this work we focus in the longitudinal case .",
    "the first authors to study in detail this problem analytically was dejardin and kamilkov @xcite .",

    "the only model that shows a significant difference from lrt is the fk model .",

    "other ratios are also shown in the figure .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that in general it is of great importance to include the anisotropy term when investigating the magnetic response of nanoparticles .",
    "as in lrt model , let us assume that a magnetic particle is subjected to a harmonic field and that the projection of the magnetization , @xmath52 , in the field direction satisfies the bloch equation , i.e. @xmath119 where @xmath54 is the relaxation time and @xmath120 is a function of the alternating field .",

    "the steady - state solution of the bloch equation is therefore @xmath128    in this approach , the corresponding slp is @xmath129    this means that one only needs to worry with the coefficient @xmath130 .",
    "this comes from the fact that in the heat loss integral only the terms obtained from @xmath105 is nonzero .",
    "note that the first term corresponds to the usual debye model , if one assumes that @xmath131 , i.e that @xmath132 is the quasi - static limit linear coefficient .",
    "also , it might be important to mention that the existence of the higher order field dependent terms indicate a correction not reported before in the literature .",
    "as for instance , if one uses the magnetization equation of the rs model , only the the quadratic field term appears .",
    "the same approach can also be used in the dielectric loss case .",
    "for example , the electric field dependence dielectric loss of glycerol ( see inset of fig . 3 of ref @xcite ) .",
    "according to equation , the bloch solution for the magnetization @xmath52 up to cubic terms in the field is @xmath133 where @xmath123 are the nth - order magnetic susceptibility coefficients . in the equation above",
    "is clear that higher - order terms are also relevant to the magnetization dynamics . as for instance",
    ", this nonlinearity effect can be identified even for the first harmonic contribution , which shows higher field order terms .",

    "if one assumes that the nth - order susceptibility terms are equal to the quasi - static terms ( @xmath110 ) and that the nanoparticle is at the superparamagnetic regime , than @xmath136 .",
    "note that the first term of this equation has been used systematically in both , magnetic particle imaging ( mpi)@xcite and magnetic nanothermometry ( mnt)@xcite . in mnt the magnetization expression was shown to be useful only at the low frequency range@xcite , which is easily explained by our model due to the range of validity of the later expression .",
    "moreover , in mpi the magnetization is similar , but not identical to our model , and differs mainly due to the term @xmath137 and that the later assumes quasi - static susceptibility terms and superparamagnetic particle . as a consequence ,",

    "further , eq . shows that the bloch equation predicts the same frequency dependence as the lrt , which will result in elliptical - like hysteresis curves that are in disagreement with experiment .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that bloch s equation is linear , whereas the underlying physical phenomena is not , as discussed before in section ii - d .",
    "one way to circumvent this is to assume that the coefficients @xmath123 depend explicitly on @xmath139 .",
    "the exact form of this dependence is problem specific , but it must be such that when @xmath110 , one recovers the equilibrium nonlinear susceptibilities . the heuristic improvement approach , also used by others@xcite , is able to better represent the magnetization dynamics .",
    "so , to correct for the aforementioned deficiency of the bloch approach , we replace @xmath123 with a frequency dependent function and compare the approximation with exact results , which are obtained for the longitudinal case using the sllg model@xcite . in this strategy",
    "we wrote @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is a function of the frequency .",
    "the quasi - static susceptibility coefficients were obtained from the series expansion of the quasi - static longitudinal solution@xcite . also , from our assumption is obvious that one should have @xmath142 .",
    "moreover , for the first term we should have @xmath143 , which corresponds to the lrt result . for the cubic term we found that @xmath144    similarly as the rs model , the magnetization can be written in the same functional form as eq .",
    ". however , now the real susceptibility terms are    @xmath145    @xmath146    while the imaginary terms are @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "those results indicate that the susceptibility terms are distinct from the rs model ( see eqs . 10 and 11 ) , even though the quasi - static susceptibility coefficients give the same result .",

    "@xcite .    after the size - sorting process powder samples were analyzed by xrd ( shimadzu 6000 ) to separate samples with similar sizes .",
    "the previous analysis was performed using the well - known scherrer equation , which is given by @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the scherrer constant , @xmath182 is the x - ray wavelength , @xmath183 is the line broadening in radians obtained from the square root of the difference between the square of the experimental width of the most intense peak to the square of silicon width ( calibration material ) , and @xmath184 is the bragg angle of the most intense peak ( 311 ) .",
    "this procedure allowed us to select three distinct samples of similar sizes containing @xmath185 , @xmath186 , or @xmath187 nanoparticles .",
    "all the nanoparticles were surface - coated with citric acid , which guarantee stability at phisiological conditions .",
    "the samples were also characterized by vsm ( ade magnetics , model ev9 , room temperature measurements , field up to 2 t ) . table [ table1 ] summarizes the relevant characterization properties of the nanoparticles .",
    "finally , magnetic hyperthermia data was obtained in two systems , one home - made which operates at 500khz , and another one from nanotherics . in particular , the later system operates in a broad frequency range , spanning from 110 up to 980khz . while details about the home - made hyperthermia system has been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the calorimetric method used to obtain the experimental slp of the sample used the equation @xmath188_{max},\\label{chicomg-1 - 1 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath189 is the heat capacity of the sample ( here assumed as the heat capacity of the liquid carrier due to the low concentration of particles ) , @xmath190 is the mass of magnetic nanoparticles in unit of grams ( obtained from the analysis of the magnetisation curves of the colloid samples ) , @xmath21 is the temperature of the sample measured with a fibre optic thermometer . note that in the slp calculation we use the value of the maximum rate of temperature increase ( @xmath191_{max}$ ] ) , as discussed previously by others @xcite .",
    "this method is believed to better estimate slp than the most common initial - slope procedure that can underestimate this value @xcite .",

    "( h ) slp as a function the square of the field for the lrt ( dash ) , nlrt ( solid ) and exact solution using the sllg ( points ) for @xmath150 values of 6 and 10 . ]",
    "several experimental results show the existence of an optimal particle size for hyperthermia @xcite .",
    "this is also contemplated in eq . , which predicts that this optimal size should occur when @xmath195 .",
    "this , however , is only true at low field amplitudes . increasing field amplitude one notice a shift of maximum size towards larger particles in a noninteracting system .",
    "this can be easily modelled within lrt using the field dependent magnetization relaxation time @xcite .",
    "indeed , such drift becomes clear when @xmath196 ( see discussion of fig .",
    "[ figure3](f ) below ) .",
    "further , numerical dynamic hysteresis simulations using the sllg model or kinetic monte carlo method @xcite show that , as the field amplitude increases , the optimal size shifts towards larger particles . it may even disappear , depending ( also ) on the magnetic anisotropy of the nanoparticle @xcite .",
    "most of the results above consider a noninteracting system .",
    "however , in colloids , or real in vivo situation , agglomerate formation plays a key role . in this case , it has been shown within lrt , that the opposite effect occurs , i.e. increasing the strength of particle interaction shift the optimal diameter to lower sizes @xcite . the same was found including particle - particle interaction using a mean field approach to the sllg model at the low field regime @xcite .",
    "anyway , a valuable analytical nonlinear response theoretical model ( nlrt ) should be able to explain at least some of the features discussed above .    a comparison between the hysteresis curves obtained from the lrt , our nlrt model and the numerical solution of the sllg model is shown in fig.[figure3](a)-(d ) , for distinct @xmath150 values considering @xmath104 and @xmath197 .",
    "it is found that the inclusion of the corrected cubic term leads to a good agreement with the numerical simulations , adequately describing the deviations from the linear response .",
    "note that the agreement is far better than any other model discussed previously ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2](a ) ) .",
    "the lrt model is shown as a dash line , the exact result using the sllg equation is shown as dash - dot line , while nlrt ( considering eq . ) is shown as solid line .",
    "it is very surprising that , with such a simple assumption , an interesting nonlinear effect is obtained able to represent far better the magnetization dynamics .",
    "indeed , we found that the present model works very well close to this limit of anisotropy value ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "it also has a slight frequency dependence which can be monitored by nonphysical results in the magnetization curve or kinks in the slp versus @xmath150 curves increasing the field . at higher fields we observe deviations from the exact solution that might be only addressed if higher - order terms are determined",
    "nevertheless , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( see the nlrt line ) , the range of validity of the model is almost completely within the hyperthermia therapeutic window .",
    "this suggests that this model might be applicable for real clinical situations .",
    "figure [ figure3](e ) shows the slp as function of @xmath150 for the lrt ( dashed line ) and the nlrt ( solid line ) for distinct field amplitudes . for simplicity , we are not considering the field dependence on the relaxation time .",
    "one can clearly observe a shift of the maximum of slp towards higher particle sizes in the nonlinear case .",
    "also a decrease of the maximum slp value for the nlrt case .",
    "the phenomenon is strictly related to the nonlinear effect introduced in the model and not due to the field effect from the relaxation .",
    "this result is in accordance with numerical simulations from the literature @xcite . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ figure3](f ) also shows slp as function of @xmath150 in both cases , but now investigating the field effect on the relaxation time for @xmath199 .",
    "similar behavior as before is observed .",
    "nevertheless , in comparison with the lrt , the nlrt-@xmath200 shows a larger size shift . as for instance , the optimum anisotropy term change from @xmath201 for lrt to @xmath202 for nlrt-@xmath200 , which corresponds to a shift in optimal diameter of the order of 4% .    as discussed in section",
    "ii , there are other nonlinear models .",
    "in particular , cubic susceptibility expressions using the rs model had been suggested to represent experimental data of noninteracting magnetic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure3](g ) shows the cubic susceptibility terms , imaginary and real , for the rs model and the nlrt model as a function of temperature . here",
    "the parameters used were @xmath203 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "as found in ref .",
    "@xcite the real cubic term in the rs model shows a significant variation as a function of temperature , in particular in the range below @xmath204 , where a quite high positive cubic value is found theoretically .",
    "it is curious to notice that experimentally such effect has not been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for noninteracting nanoparticle samples .",
    "in fact , discrepancies between the rs model and data of ref .",
    "@xcite had been attributed to polydispersity and particle - particle interaction effects .",
    "note that the inclusion of such effects could be responsible for some of those differences between theory and data .",
    "however , there might be another explanation .",
    "as we have just shown , the nlrt model represents far better the magnetization response . differently from the rs model ,",
    "the real cubic susceptibility from nlrt does not show such strong positive contribution at low temperatures . as a consequence",
    "it might represent better experimental data .",
    "another point that could be commented about the improvement in the nlrt model in comparison to others is the slp calculation .",
    "note that in the rs model the slp calculation , using the magnetization expression of eq .",
    ", provides the same result as the lrt .",
    "so , although the magnetization equations are not the same , the hysteresis area is the same as the lrt case .",
    "again , this is in contradiction with several experimental results . from the experimental point of view , after obtaining the slp data of the samples as a function of the applied alternating field , it is common to try to describe the heating efficiency in terms of a field exponent , i.e. one might try to fit the data with an allometric expression as @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a constant and @xmath207 the field exponent .",
    "if this exponent is equal to 2 one might argue that the sample is within the linear response regime .",
    "figure 3(h ) shows the slp as a function of the quadratic field for distinct @xmath150 values considering the lrt ( dash ) , nlrt ( solid ) and sllg ( points ) .",
    "both situations shows that depending on the particle size or anisotropy , deviations from the expected quadratic field dependence of the lrt are found . at the low barrier regime ( @xmath208 ) , i.e. for particle sizes lower than the optimum value , the field dependence exponent is lower than 2 . while at the high barrier regime , an exponent higher than 2 is observed .",
    "the same behavior is found from sllg , as expected since nlrt model is based on the assumption that sllg is the exact result .",
    "however , because in the nlrt only the cubic term was introduced , deviations between both models are expected for higher fields .",
    "the nonlinear regime has been studied experimentally before on ref .",
    "@xcite , where the transition to the nonlinear regime was explained using the sllg model , though without any analytical expression . the explanation for such behavior may be understood using eq . .",
    "note that @xmath116 , so when @xmath209 the high - order contribution term lowers the linear slp field dependence term .",
    "the consequence of this is an apparent field exponent lower than 2 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath210 the higher order slp term changes sign , which now adds a value to the first order term .",
    "in this case exponents larger than 2 might appear if the field is high enough .",
    "evidence of nonlinear behavior the slp field dependence can be found in distinct ferrite - based powder samples .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarizes the parameters obtained from sample analysis .",
    "four sets of samples were studied .",
    "the first set is composed of three samples : manganese - ferrite based nanoparticles undoped , doped with zinc and doped with cobalt .",
    "since samples were produced using the same method , have ( approximately ) the same magnetization , and the same diameter , this set allow the study of anisotropy influence over slp versus @xmath211 behavior .",
    "the second set is composed by other three samples : cobalt - ferrite , maghemite and copper - ferrite .",
    "these samples have very different magnetization and anisotropy , but the same diameter ( some results published in ref .",
    "the third set is composed by other three samples of cobalt - ferrite , which have a high anisotropy , with different diameters . and",
