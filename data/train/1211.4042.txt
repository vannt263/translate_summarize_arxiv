    "intense ultrafast laser excitation of solids can alter dramatically the interatomic forces by depositing substantial amounts of energy into free - carriers on a time scale that is short compared to energy relaxation .",
    "the resulting non - thermal distribution of electrons in the bands of the material can drive coherent phonon motion , as well as dissipate its energy to the lattice by incoherent electron - phonon scattering .",
    "the evolution of the interatomic forces following photoexcitation is strongly dependent on the evolution of the electron distribution as it relaxes back to thermal equilibrium .",
    "free carrier relaxation in metals , semimetals and semiconductors is strongly influenced by the electronic density of states at the energies where electrons and holes are present .",
    "near equilibrium , electrons and holes in both metals and semimetals lie in an energy range of a few @xmath4 of the fermi energy ( @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath6 is the absolute temperature ) .",
    "the significant difference between the two is in the density of states at the fermi level : for a typical metal , this is of the order of 1  ev@xmath7 ( per unit cell ) ; for a semimetal like bismuth , it is of the order of @xmath8  ev@xmath7 . in metals ,",
    "the relatively high density of final states gives rise to a momentum relaxation time of the order of a few femtoseconds @xcite , whereas the very low density of states in semimetals suppresses relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium , particularly in equilibration between the electron and hole distributions@xcite .",
    "bismuth is an indirect semimetal ",
    "its electron and hole band extrema lie in different regions of the brillouin zone ( @xmath9 and @xmath6 points respectively )  so that electron - phonon scattering is the dominant mechanism by which equilibrium is established between electrons and holes  @xcite . in semiconductors , whereas thermalization of carriers within each band occurs on a sub - picosecond timescale , an energy band gap separates the electron and hole state energies , eliminating recombination by electron - phonon interaction and giving rise to typical recombination times of the order of ns .    in the group",
    "v semimetals , the photoexcitation of modest plasma density leads to large amplitude atomic motion corresponding to a coherent zone - center fully symmetric ( a@xmath10 ) optical phonon @xcite .",
    "the initial photoexcited electronic distribution is determined by the intensity , photon energy and polarization of the incident light .",
    "the intensity determines the overall number of carriers , the photon energy their energy distribution within the bands and the optical polarization gives rise to anisotropy in the distribution ( i.e. differences in the photoexcited carrier occupation ) between equivalent regions of the brillouin zone .",
    "this distribution relaxes back to the thermal equilibrium distribution over time in a series of stages . electron momentum relaxation ( due to electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering ) removes the anisotropy on a timescale of the momentum scattering time .",
    "the electronic energy distribution relaxes more slowly because many scattering events are required to change significantly the energy of an electron . when this process is due to electron - phonon scattering , heat is simultaneously transferred from the electronic to the vibrational degrees of freedom , raising the lattice temperature .",
    "finally , scattering between conduction and valence bands , which can occur by electron - phonon scattering only when electrons are very near the bottom of the conduction band , establishes equilibrium in the occupation of conduction and valence bands on the timescale of the electron - hole recombination time@xcite .",
    "recently there has been considerable interest in the dynamics of the a@xmath10 mode in the limit of a dense electron - hole plasma , particularly for bismuth @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed that the frequency of the mode is impulsively softened and chirped toward the equilibrium value over a few picoseconds .",
    "@xcite demonstrated both experimentally using double pulse excitation and theoretically using constrained density functional theory ( dft ) and frozen phonon calculations , that the chirp was dominated by electronic softening and the evolution of the dense electron - hole plasma .",
    "later , the theoretical studies were extended to include softening of the entire phonon spectrum @xcite .",
    "the general results for the @xmath11 mode were confirmed by @xcite using femtosecond x - ray diffraction to measure the quasi - equilibrium position and curvature of the excited state potential .",
    "however , the results of measurement of ultrafast oscillations in the debye - waller factor by @xcite suggested that the coupling of the plasma with low - frequency acoustic phonon modes may not be well described in current theoretical models@xcite .    the calculations in ref . and assume that a single electron - hole pair is created by each absorbed photon and that , whereas intraband scattering rapidly establishes a fermi - dirac distribution of carriers in each band , the electron - hole recombination time is substantially longer than the period of the relevant phonon and , as a result , the chemical potential for the conduction bands differs from that of the valence bands ( two chemical potential model ) .",
    "this `` two chemical potential '' model is implicit in the previous analyses of low - temperature ultrasonic attenuation in semimetals @xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite performed frozen phonon calculations on the zone - center mode , also assuming rapid scattering and equilibration throughout all conduction and valence bands , but using a single chemical potential , in which the carrier density is determined solely by the temperature of the electron - hole plasma .",
    "@xcite performed depth resolved femtosecond x - ray diffraction to measure the phonon dynamics and concluded that the two - chemical potential model may be appropriate only on a time - scale less than a single phonon period , transitioning a single chemical potential model . @xcite",
    "have analyzed the bragg peak intensities , reported in ref .  , using the model that assumes rapid thermalization of the carrier distribution throughout all bands and finds agreement with the experimental results that is as satisfactory as that obtained with the two chemical potential model .",
    "recently @xcite measured a 23 ps lattice thermalization time of the photoexcited carriers in the limit of dense excitation using ultrafast electron diffraction , indicating a rapid energy transfer from carriers to the lattice .",
    "still the dynamics of the photoexcited carriers are not well understood .",
    "the rapid transfer of energy to the lattice suggested in ref . may call into question the detailed quantitative conclusions of analyses ( including those of refs .  ) that have assumed insignificant heat transfer from the electron - hole plasma to the lattice vibration modes in the first few picoseconds following photo - excitation .    here",
    "we report results of ultrafast counter - propagating pump - probe measurements of the photoexcited carrier dynamics in a series of optically thick single crystal bismuth films of various thickness at room temperature . by measuring the transient reflectivity signal on the opposite face of the film ,",
    "we are able to separate the effects of carrier dynamics , lattice heating and strain , whereas the effects are coupled when probed on the same face as the pump @xcite . in this manner , we are able to measure separately the ambipolar diffusivity along the trigonal axis and the carrier recombination rate . by comparing the reflectivity changes at the front and back of the film at delay times from 100 to 500 ps , we find that the film is heated much more at the front than at the back , consistent with recent grazing incidence x - ray diffraction measurements on the thermal transport in thin bi films@xcite and confirming unambigously that most of the heat transfer from the electron - hole plasma to the lattice occurs in the 5 ps following photoexcitation , before the plasma diffuses to a uniform density within the film @xcite .    the principal aim of the current experiment is to estimate the timescales of momentum relaxation , heat transfer to the lattice , and electron - hole recombination . in particular , by investigating the diffusion of carriers to the back of films of various thickness , we estimate the momentum scattering time . by comparing the final heating of the front and back sides of the film",
    ", we put lower limits on the rate of heat transfer to the lattice , and by observing the decay of the plasma at the back of the film , we estimate the timescale of electron - hole recombination .",
    "we interpret each of these timescales within a common framework of electron - phonon scattering and with reference to the known band structure of bismuth and find qualitative agreement between the various relaxation times observed .",
    "we discuss the relationship of these results to early studies  @xcite of low - temperature electron - hole recombination rates and to the relevant electronic density of states in various regimes of electronic excitation .",
    "we argue , based on a picture of electron - phonon scattering , that the relaxation of carrier momentum within the hole and electron bands of the initially excited plasma should occur at a rate typical of metals ( with a relaxation time of the order of a several femtoseconds ) , that cooling of the plasma and corresponding lattice heating should occur on a timescale of a few picoseconds and that electron - hole recombination should occur substantially more slowly than either of these processes .",
    "we argue that as the plasma cools towards room temperature the electron - hole recombination rate and the plasma cooling rate should be of similar magnitude as a greater proportion of the excited carriers lie in the energy range where the conduction and valence bands overlap .",
