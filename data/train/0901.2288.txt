    "the _ complexity _ @xmath9 of @xmath1 is the minimum number of true vertices among all almost simple spines of @xmath1 .",

    "a complete classification of closed orientable prime manifolds up to complexity 12 can be found in @xcite .    in general , the computation of the complexity of a given manifold is a difficult problem .",
    "so , two - sided estimates of complexity become important , especially when dealing with infinite families of manifolds ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    by (",
    "* theorem 2.6.2 ) , a lower bound for the complexity of a given manifold can be obtained via the computation of its first homology group . moreover , for a hyperbolic manifold a lower bound can be obtained via volume arguments ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand",

    "we deal with the possibility of calculating complexity via heegaard decompositions .",
    "this way of representing 3-manifold has revealed to be very useful in different contests .",

    "we use heegaard diagrams to define modified heegaard complexity of compact 3-manifolds and compare this notion with matveev complexity .",
    "a widely studied family of manifolds , defined via heegaard diagrams , is the one of dunwoody manifolds ( see @xcite ) .",

    "in this section we introduce the notions of modified complexity for heegaard diagrams and for manifolds , comparing these notions with matveev complexity of manifolds .",
    "let us start by recalling some definitions .",
    "let @xmath17 be a closed , connected , orientable surface of genus @xmath18 .",
    "a _ system of curves _ on @xmath17 is a ( possibly empty ) set of simple closed curves @xmath19 on @xmath17 such that @xmath20 if @xmath21 , for @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , we denote with @xmath23 the set of connected components of the surface obtained by cutting @xmath17 along the curves of @xmath24 .",
    "the system @xmath24 is said to be _ proper _ if all elements of @xmath23 have genus zero , and _ reduced _ if either @xmath25 or @xmath26 has no elements of genus zero .",

    "note that a proper reduced system of curves on @xmath17 contains exactly @xmath18 curves .",
    "we denote by @xmath29 the graph which is dual to the one determined by @xmath24 on @xmath17 .",
    "thus , vertices of @xmath29 correspond to elements of @xmath23 and edges correspond to curves of @xmath24 .",
    "note that loops and multiple edges may arise in  @xmath29 .    a _ compression body _",
    "@xmath30 of genus @xmath18 is a 3-manifold with boundary , obtained from @xmath31 $ ] by attaching a finite set of 2-handles @xmath32 along a system of curves ( called _ attaching circles _ ) on @xmath33 and filling in with balls all the spherical boundary components of the resulting manifold , except from @xmath34 when @xmath35 .",

    "we call @xmath97 _ closed dunwoody diagram_. the _ generalized dunwoody manifold _",
    "@xmath98 is the manifold @xmath99 .",
    "since both the diagram and the identification rule are invariant with respect to an obvious cyclic action of order @xmath11 , the generalized dunwoody manifold @xmath98 admits a cyclic symmetry of order  @xmath11 .",

    "as proved in @xcite , the class of dunwoody manifolds coincides with the class of strongly - cyclic branched covering of @xmath16-knots .",

    "this result allows us to find upper bounds for the modified complexity ( and so for matveev complexity ) of generalized dunwoody manifolds . in the following subsections",
    "we specialize the estimates to the cases of some important families .",

    "hence by theorem  [ prop ] @xmath160 in case ( i ) the upper ( and lower ) region of the dunwoody diagram has @xmath119 vertices that are not identified together by the gluing , while for all the other regions it is clear that @xmath161 .",
    "more precisely , the six vertices of hexagonal regions remain all distinct if @xmath162 , while two of them are identified if @xmath163 .",
    "if @xmath164 then @xmath98 is not a dunwoody manifold since @xmath47 is not reduced .    in case ( ii )",
    "the dunwoody diagram has regions with @xmath165 vertices .",

    "proposition  [ prop8 ] allows to obtain an upper bound for the complexity of cyclic branched coverings of 2-bridge knots ( corollary  [ cor9 ] ) and some families of torus knots ( corollary  [ cor11 ] ) , and a family of seifert manifolds ( corollary  [ cor12 ] ) .",
    "this result improves the upper bound obtained in @xcite , where the lower bound has been obtained in the hyperbolic case ( i.e. @xmath181 ) via volume estimates .",
    "now we give a lower bound for the remaining cases .",
    "obviously @xmath184 since @xmath185 is the mirror image of @xmath186 .",
    "moreover @xmath186 is the torus knot of type @xmath187 and therefore @xmath188 is the brieskorn manifold of type @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "its first homology group is @xmath190 if @xmath11 is even , and @xmath191 if @xmath11 is odd ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since the manifold is irreducible ( and different from @xmath15 ) , the result follows by applying theorem  2.6.2 of @xcite .",
    "we remark that an algorithm developed in @xcite allows us to obtain a presentation of each @xmath11-fold cyclic branched covering of a torus knot as a dunwoody manifold and so to compute an upper bound for the complexity by using proposition  [ prop8 ] .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that if @xmath211 and @xmath212 , @xmath139 , @xmath213 , then seifert manifolds @xmath214 are dunwoody manifolds that generalize the class of neuwirth manifolds introduced in @xcite and corresponding to @xmath215 and @xmath216 . below we will give upper and lower estimates for complexity of these seifert manifolds .",
