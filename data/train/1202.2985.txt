    "the discovery 6 years ago of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in graphene sparked an immediate interest in the metrological community  @xcite .",
    "the qhe is a fascinating macroscopic quantum effect occurring in two - dimensional conductors and relates the resistance quantum , @xmath2 only to the fundamental constants of nature , @xmath3 , the planck constant and , @xmath4 , the elementary charge  @xcite .",
    "although the qhe has been used successfully in metrology to realise the resistance scale for more than two decades  @xcite , graphene is a material with properties like no other .",
    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal crystal lattice structure , is a truly two dimensional metal with a linear dispersion relationship characteristic of massless dirac - type charge carriers  @xcite .",
    "the unique bandstructure of this semi - metal has both practical and fundamental implications .",
    "firstly , the massless nature of the charge carriers leads to a landau level spectrum with an energy gap between the first two levels which is around 5 times larger than that in semiconductor materials for magnetic fields around 10 tesla .",
    "this implies that the qhe in graphene can be observed at much reduced magnetic fields and/or much higher temperatures  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the marked difference in bandstructure and charge carrier characteristics between graphene and semiconductor systems allows for a demonstration of the universality of the quantum hall effect through a rigorous test of the material independence of the value of @xmath5 , the von klitzing constant .",
    "theory predicts no measurable corrections to the simple relation @xmath1 . the quantum hall resistance is considered to be a topological invariant  @xcite , not altered by the electron - electron interaction , spin - orbit coupling , or hyperfine interaction with nuclei .",
    "it has also been shown that the quantised hall resistance is insensitive to much more subtle influences of the gravitational field  @xcite .",
    "recently , a quantum electrodynamical approach to charge carriers in a magnetic field has predicted a tiny correction to the von klitzing constant of the order of @xmath6 for practical magnetic field values  @xcite .",
    "however , the size of this predicted correction is about 10 to 8 orders of magnitude smaller than the most accurate measurement techniques available and therefore untestable .",
    "nevertheless , the fundamental nature of the hall resistance quantisation makes experimental tests of its universality of the utmost importance , in particular , for improving our knowledge of two fundamental quantities of nature : the electron charge and the planck constant .",
    "the precision obtained through a universality test as presented here is much greater than is possible by a comparison of the best values of the constants @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the complete set of published results carried out by codata  @xcite showed no deviation from @xmath2 to within @xmath7 , which calls for more accurate measurements .",
    "universality of @xmath5 will strongly support the pending redefinition of the si - units for mass and current in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison of the hall resistance in two different substances does not prove the exactness of the relationship @xmath1 ; however , material independence is a significant factor in establishing the fundamental nature of @xmath5 .",
    "this material independence turns out to be rather difficult to establish .",
    "indeed the characteristics of qhe samples must satisfy very stringent requirements  @xcite and in 30 years only silicon mosfets ( metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ) and iii - v ( gaas / algaas or ingaas / inp ) heterostuctures did so .",
    "the first accurate measurements of the qhe in graphene were performed by giesbers _",
    "_  @xcite on exfoliated samples .",
    "the precision obtained in these measurements was 15  ppm and limited by the high ( @xmath8 ) contact resistances together with a small ( @xmath9 ) maximum source - drain current which these samples could sustain before breakdown of the qhe occurred .",
    "a large measurement current determines the maximum signal - to - noise ratio and increasing this breakdown current is key to high resolution measurements .",
    "one established method of increasing the breakdown current is to increase the sample width  @xcite which is not easy to achieve with the exfoliation technique .    in 2009 a number of groups around the world almost simultaneously succeeded in growing large - area wafers of epitaxial graphene by sublimation of sic with a quality good enough to observe the quantised hall resistance  @xcite . in an indirect comparison with a gaas / algaas device via an intermediate room - temperature standard resistor , we demonstrated universality of @xmath5 with an uncertainty of 3  parts in @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the measurement system  @xcite was identical to that used by giesbers _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the key factors in the improvement were the very low contact resistances and large sample size which were achieved , resulting in an order of magnitude increase in the breakdown current .",
    "subsequently we undertook a direct comparison between epitaxial graphene and two gaas / algaas devices using a modified measurement system demonstrating equivalence to an accuracy of 8.6 parts in @xmath11  @xcite . recently",
    ", much progress has been made on metrological quantum hall measurements in exfoliated graphene devices with accuracies continuously increasing to around 5 parts in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed description of the graphene device characterisation , measurement system , data analysis and resulting uncertainty budget which underpins the direct comparison result  @xcite .",

    "the values for the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] . ]    in  @xcite we reported the first accurate measurements of the quantum hall effect in large high - quality epitaxial samples .",
    "the material studied in our experiments was grown on the si - terminated face of a 4h - sic(0001 ) substrate  @xcite .",
    "the reaction kinetics on the si - face are slower than on the c - face because of the higher surface energy , which helps homogeneous and well - controlled graphene formation .",
    "graphene was grown at 2000  @xmath17c and 1  atm ar gas pressure , which result in monolayers of graphene atomically uniform over more than 50  @xmath18 , as shown by low - energy electron microscopy .",
    "twenty hall bar devices of different sizes , from 160  @xmath19 down to 11.6  @xmath20 were produced on each 0.5  @xmath21 wafer using standard electron beam lithography and oxygen plasma etching ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) images revealed that the graphene layer covers the substrate steps like a carpet , preserving its structural integrity  @xcite .",
    "contacts to graphene were produced by straightforward deposition of 3  nm of ti and 100  nm of au through a lithographically defined mask followed by lift - off , with a typical area of graphene - metal interface of @xmath22 for each contact . using transport measurements in low magnetic fields",
    ", we established that the manufactured material was n - doped , with the measured electron concentration in the range of @xmath23 , mobility about @xmath24 at room temperature and between 4000 and @xmath25 at 4.2  k , almost independent of device dimensions and orientation with respect to the substrate terraces .",
    "all results presented in this work were obtained on the largest hall bar ( i.e. 160  @xmath26 35  @xmath27 ) .",
    "in fact epitaxial graphene grown on sic is always strongly n - type doped with carrier densities typically in the range of @xmath28 .",
    "the doping of the graphene is caused by the so - called `` dead layer '' of carbon atoms in between the sic substrate and graphene .",
    "this layer is non - conducting and characterised by a @xmath29 supercell of the reconstructed surface of sublimated sic .",
    "missing or substituted carbon atoms in various positions of such a huge supercell in the dead layer create localised surface states with a broad distribution of energies within the bandgap of sic .",
    "it appears that the density of such defects is higher in material grown at low temperatures ( @xmath30 ) resulting in graphene doped to a large electron density  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the material used in this work is grown at high temperatures in a highly pressurised atmosphere of ar which seems to improve the integrity of the reconstructed dead layer , leading to a lower density of donors on the surface and , therefore , producing graphene with a much lower initial doping  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows a typical measurement of the longitudinal and transverse resistivity as a function of magnetic flux density @xmath31 at low temperatures .",
    "wide plateaux are observed in the transverse resistivity which are accompanied by a vanishingly small value of the longitudinal resistivity .",

    "a small weak localisation peak is visible - a signature of quantum coherence in disordered fermi liquid in epitaxial graphene  @xcite .",
    "charateristic scattering lengths have been determined from the analysis of the weak localisation correction to the drude conductivity . for our graphene grown on sic we find that the phase coherence length @xmath33 at low temperatures , the intervalley scattering length @xmath34 and the intravalley scattering length @xmath35 , the latter two being virtually temperature independent .",
    "these experimental scattering lengths set a limit of at least 50  ps on the spin relaxation time in this material .",

    "table  [ contacts ] shows the measured contact resistances for our device and demonstrates that this condition is satisfied for most of the contacts .",
    "our graphene device was approximately two years old at the time of these measurements and had been thermally cycled between 300  mk and room temperature more than a dozen times .",
    "also the contacts have been re - bonded several times in the to8-header which has caused damage to some of the bonding pads and is the most likely cause of the poor resistance of contacts @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( on pristine devices we routinely get all contact resistances below 1  @xmath43 ) .",

    "this is achieved by coating the device with a polymer bilayer , a spacer layer ( pmma ) followed by an active polymer ( zep520 ) able to generate potent electron acceptors under uv light exposure .",
    "the effect can be reversed by heating the sample to 170@xmath17c just above the glass transition temperature of the polymer .",
    "using this technique the carrier density of our device was reduced to @xmath46 resulting in an extremely wide @xmath45 quantum hall plateau as can be seen in figure  [ fig3](b ) .",
    "accurate quantum hall resistance measurements require that the longitudinal voltage remains zero ( in practice , below the noise level of the voltmeter ) to ensure the device is in the non - dissipative state , which can be violated by the breakdown of the qhe at high source - drain current levels .",

    "we can be confident that the longitudinal resistivity is vanishingly small and that there is a considerable safety margin on @xmath48 in our experiments .",
    "a few measurements were performed at a lower magnetic flux density around 11  t. for these measurements a lower @xmath48 of @xmath60 was chosen and a smilar extrapolation of the high source - drain currents gives @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "returning to figure  [ fig3](b ) , we note that the measured @xmath53 for contact pairs on either side of the device is virtualy identical . @xmath53 as a function of magnetic flux density shows a rather unusual dependence as the breakdown current continues to increase in the @xmath45 quantum hall state reaching @xmath63 at our maximum field of @xmath64 .",
    "this behaviour is very different from that observed in conventional semiconductor systems where the breakdown current peaks at the exact integer filling factor  @xcite indicated by the dashed blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by a magnetic field dependent charge transfer mechanism between the interfacial layer and graphene  @xcite .",
    "the amount of charge transfer is determined by the interplay of classical ( as a result of the geometry ) and quantum ( as a result of the density of states ) capacitance of the device structure .",
    "the density of states oscillates as the landau levels ( ll ) pass through the fermi level when the magnetic field increases .",
    "the result is that the carrier density in the graphene layer is also oscillating and specifically when the fermi level is between the @xmath65 and @xmath66 ll , the carrier density increases linearly with magnetic field .",
    "this effectively pins the filling factor at @xmath45 over a broad range of magnetic field resulting in _ a novel quantum hall state which is ideally suited for high precision resistance metrology_. the anomalous pinning is responsible for the _ extremely high breakdown current _ and _ wide operational parameter space _ of an epitaxial graphene quantum hall device .",

    "the fact that the sign of @xmath77 changes with the @xmath31-field direction indicates that the observed relation between @xmath73 and @xmath37 is due to inhomogeneity of the charge density in the sample as proposed by van der wel _",

    "it can be seen that the data do not quite follow a linear dependence as might be expected .",
    "a likely reason for this deviation is the fact that as a function of @xmath31 the charge carrier density in epitaxial graphene is not constant which could result in a variation of @xmath77 as a function of @xmath31 .    comparing the performance of our graphene device with that of gaas devices shows a significantly wider operational parameter space for the @xmath45 quantum hall state . in gaas",
    "the field range is usually a few tenths of teslas up to 1 tesla for the best devices and for temperature the operational range is generally below 2  k  @xcite .",
    "this result is not surprising given the fact that the energy spacing between the @xmath92 and @xmath93 landau levels is approximately seven times larger in graphene than in gaas around a magnetic flux density of 10  t. also the breakdown current in graphene compares favorably with that in gaas .",

    "it is important to note that for the lowest charge carrier density ( @xmath96 ) in our graphene device we have not yet reached the centre of the @xmath45 quantum hall plateau and the operational parameter space is likely to be even wider at higher magnetic flux densities or in devices with even lower charge carrier density .",
