    "due to recent substantial progress in the field of ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices,@xcite an almost complete real - time control of the parameters of a quantum system has become experimentally feasible .",
    "the study of ultracold fermions in optical lattices thus offers unique new possibilities to understand the non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems .",
    "symmetries play an important role for the quantum dynamics .",
    "particularly interesting are `` dynamical symmetries '' where the time - dependent expectation value of an observable is the same for certain different initial states due to the invariance of the observable as well as of the time - evolution operator under an ( anti-)unitary transformation ( see appendix [ sec : dsym ] ) .",
    "recently , the expansion of an initially confined quantum gas of fermions in the lowest band of a homogeneous optical lattice has been studied after suddenly switching off the confining potential , and the observed independence of the dynamics on the sign of the ( hubbard - type ) interaction could be explained by a dynamical symmetry.@xcite    here , we study a different situation where a dynamical symmetry holds _ locally _ for two different initial states but is broken due to their coupling to the environment .",
    "we consider the dynamics of a system of strongly interacting spin-1/2 fermions in a two - dimensional hubbard model at half - filling on a square lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "this has become accessible to studies of ultracold quantum gases.@xcite the local density of spin-@xmath2 particles , @xmath3 , is our observable of interest .",
    "it has been demonstrated recently with bosons that the parity of the number of particles can be measured with single - site resolution even in a strongly correlated system .",
    "@xcite for the hubbard model and observables @xmath3 , we will argue that a particular combination @xmath4 of time - reversal , an asymmetric particle - hole and a staggered sign transformation represents a dynamical symmetry .",
    "an interesting question is how fast an initially prepared `` classical '' state builds up entanglement and correlations .",
    "this can be studied by preparing the initial state as the ground state of the model with isolated plaquettes @xmath5 , i.e.@xmath6 , while for the subsequent time evolution ( @xmath7 ) the inter - plaquette hopping @xmath8 is suddenly switched on at @xmath9 .",
    "double - well systems in one dimension@xcite as well as plaquette systems in two dimensions@xcite have recently been studied experimentally .",
    "a non - trivial dynamics , already for an isolated plaquette , is obtained by preparing the plaquette initial state with the help of local fields producing a classical nel state with staggered spins @xmath10 or a charge - density wave @xmath11 and by suddenly switching off the field at @xmath9 . in case of full polarization , these states transform into each other under @xmath4 while the plaquette ground state in the absence of the fields , @xmath12 , is not invariant under @xmath4 . by comparing the time evolution of @xmath3 starting from the initial plaquette product state with a global nel excitation with the corresponding one for a global cdw excitation , we study the effects of the dynamical symmetry . in case of a nel or cdw excitation that is localized to a single plaquette , we expect a breakdown of the dynamical symmetry due to the inter - plaquette coupling .",
    "another goal of the present paper is a methodical one : studying the real - time dynamics of a strongly - correlated lattice - fermion model in two dimensions far from equilibrium is a highly non - trivial task .",
    "standard methods as dynamical density - matrix renormalization group@xcite or quantum monte - carlo@xcite approaches can not be used in this case .",
    "we therefore resort to a cluster ( plaquette ) mean - field approach that has been developed recently for one - dimensional and impurity - type models , namely the non - equilibrium variant @xcite of the cluster - perturbation theory ( cpt).@xcite the ne - cpt can be characterized as a time - dependent multiple - scattering approach .",
    "it is exact for the non - interacting model with hubbard-@xmath13 and in the case of disconnected clusters , i.e.  @xmath14 . in the general case ,",

    "to discuss the main idea of the non - equilibrium cluster - perturbation theory ( ne - cpt ) and the necessary steps for an extension to two - dimensional lattice fermion models , we consider the single - band hubbard model.@xcite using standard notations , the hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for @xmath7 is given by : @xmath15 we formally allow for an explicit time dependence of @xmath16 but will restrict ourselves to @xmath17 for the evaluation of the theory . in the latter case ,",

    "the third term represents the hopping interlinking the different clusters , and the corresponding matrix elements are denoted by @xmath21 . the hilbert space associated with an isolated cluster",
    "is assumed to be sufficiently small such that all cluster physical quantities of interest can be calculated exactly by numerical means .",

    "a local doublon - holon excitation of the ground state of the half - filled model has been considered .",
    "the doublon is found to delocalize quickly on a time scale of a few @xmath173 , very similar to doublon delocalization in an empty - band system , @xcite but , on a scale of several tens of @xmath173 , does not completely _ decay _ as higher - order many - body scattering processes are necessary in the strong - coupling regime to break up the repulsively bound fermion pair consistent with energy conservation .",

    "our results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results_glob ] ) are again qualitatively consistent with the dmrg data : at @xmath177 we find the local occupation numbers close to unity ( @xmath178 ) or zero ( @xmath179 ) . here",
    ", we can easily estimate @xmath180 .",
    "as the occupation - number dynamics @xmath181 does not differ very much from the dynamics for an isolated plaquette on the time interval considered here , we expect the same for @xmath175 .",
    "for the isolated plaquette , we in fact find @xmath175 slightly oscillating around a value smaller but close to 0.5 .",
    "the generalization of the cluster - perturbation theory to systems with a non - trivial real - time dynamics of an initial non - equilibrium state provides a conceptually appealing approach that has been demonstrated as numerically feasible even for two - dimensional lattice models of strongly correlated fermions .",
    "the ne - cpt represents a non - self - consistent cluster mean - field - type approach where the effect of the scattering at the inter - cluster potential on the self - energy is neglected . for the particle - hole and spin symmetric hubbard model",
    ", it nevertheless respects macroscopic conservation laws and has previously been shown @xcite to be able to reliably describe relaxation dynamics on short time scales for one - dimensional and impurity - type models .",
    "the present study has addressed important numerical improvements that are necessary to study two - dimensional models : first , for a numerically efficient evaluation of the ne - cpt equations on the keldysh - matsubara contour , we have rewritten and implemented the ne - cpt equations for the different components of the non - equilibrium green s function .",
    "this leads to a considerable increase of the numerical accuracy and the accessible times . secondly and more important , however",
    ", we have demonstrated that standard concepts of multiple - scattering theory , known from _",
    "ab initio _ electronic - structure theory , can successfully be applied to the non - equilibrium case .",
    "the iterative scheme of coupling of only two equal or different building blocks at a time represents an efficient and flexible concept that is applicable to the two - dimensional case but may also be useful in different and even more complicated situations , e.g.  in cases with fewer spatial symmetries .    as a concrete example , the dynamics of the hubbard model on a @xmath0 square array has been considered for initial states prepared as plaquette - product states .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of the spin - dependent local occupation numbers to understand relaxation effects induced by inter - plaquette correlations building up in the course of time .",
    "their real - time dynamics in the two states @xmath126 and @xmath127 with a _",
    "global _ staggered spin or charge excitation is found to be identical .",

    "this dynamical symmetry prevents a fast relaxation of the cdw initial state which was expected to take place on a short time scale @xmath167 related to charge dynamics .    if , on the other hand , the dynamical symmetry is broken by preparing the spin or charge excitation _ locally _ on the plaquette @xmath72 only while the rest of the system is given as a product of plaquette ground states @xmath182 , a clear separation of energy and time scales is observed in the relaxation dynamics : the occupation numbers in the spin - excited plaquette ( @xmath183 ) show an overall slow coupling to the environment on the scale @xmath184 , with some fast but small oscillations due to residual charge fluctuations on top .",
    "contrary , a charge dynamics on the scale @xmath185 is seen to result in a fast relaxation of the of occupation numbers for the charge - excited state @xmath186 .",
    "one might speculate on the long - time limit that is not accessible to real - time greens - function - based approaches as the ne - cpt : for the global spin and charge excited states , the dynamical symmetry enforces equal time evolutions although the total energies per site are largely different ( @xmath187 ) which therefore implies different thermal states characterized by different temperatures eventually .",
    "in fact , the dynamical symmetry translates into a symmetry of the thermal states as @xmath188 under @xmath4 implies a transformation of the ( normalized ) thermal mixed state @xmath189 with a negative temperature @xmath190 . for the locally excited states , on the other hand",
