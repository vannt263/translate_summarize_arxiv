    "fractional calculus is a generalization of integration and derivation to non - integer order fundamental operator @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the limits of the operation .",
    "the two definitions used for the general fractional differintegral are the grnwald definition and the riemann - liouville definition @xcite .",
    "the idea of fractional calculus has been known since the development of the regular calculus , with the first reference probably being associated with leibniz and lhospital in 1695 .",
    "fractional calculus was used for modelling of physical systems , but we can find only few works dealing with the application of this mathematical tool in control theory ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the aim of this paper is to show , how by using the fractional calculus , we can obtain a more general structure for the classical @xmath6 controller , for controlled systems with memory and hereditary behaviour , and how to model fractional - order systems in the frequency domain . on the other hand",
    ", we can analyse the fractional - order systems and specify the conditions of stability in bode s and nyquist s frequency response .",
    "we will be studying the control system shown in fig.[f1 ] , where @xmath7 is the controller transfer function and @xmath8 is the controlled system transfer function .      the fractional controlled system will be represented with fractional model with frequency transfer function given by the following expression : @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 are generally real numbers , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 are arbitrary constants .",
    "identification methods @xcite for determination of the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath16 @xmath15 were developed , based on minimisation of the difference between the calculated and experimentally measured values .",
    "the optimisation consists in minimising the square norm of the difference between the measured frequency response @xmath17 and the frequency response of the model @xmath8 .",
    "the quadratic criterion is given by the expression : @xmath18 is the number of measured values of frequencies .",
    "the fractional @xmath19 controller will be represented by frequency transfer function given in the following expression : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are arbitrary real numbers @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the proportional constant , @xmath25 is the integration constant and @xmath26 is the derivation constant .    taking @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we obtain a  classic @xmath6 controller .",
    "if @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 , we obtain a  @xmath31 controller , etc .",
    "all these types of controllers are particular cases of the @xmath19 controller , which is more flexible and gives an opportunity to better adjust the dynamical properties of the fractional - order control system .    the @xmath19 controller with complex zeros and poles located anywhere in the left - hand @xmath32-plane may be rewritten as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a gain , @xmath35 is the dimensionless damping ratio and @xmath36 is the natural frequency .",
    "normally , we choose @xmath37 . when @xmath38 , the condition is called critical damping @xcite .",
    "the tuning of @xmath19 controller parameters is determined according to the given requirements .",
    "these requirements are , for example , the stability measure , the accuracy of the regulation process , dynamical properties etc .",
    "one of the methods being developed is the method ( modification of roots locus method ) of dominant roots @xcite , based on the given stability measure and the damping measure of the control circuit .",
    "another possible way to obtain the controller parameters is using the tuning formula , based on gain and phase margins specifications .",
    "the graphical interpretation of the frequency transfer function for different values of the angular frequency @xmath39 in the range @xmath40 is called the frequency characteristic .",
    "the practical meaning of the frequency characteristics is in the determination of the stability of control circuits from the behavior of the frequency characteristic .",
    "stability is an asymptotic qualitative criterion of the quality of the control circuit and is the primary and necessary condition for correct functioning of every control circuit .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate the stability of a fractional - order control circuit by examining its characteristic equation either by finding its dominant roots or by algebraic methods .",
    "the methods given are suitable for integer - order systems . in our case",
    "we use bode s and nyquist s frequency characteristic to investigate the stability @xcite .    for the frequency transfer of the open control circuit @xmath41 with respect to ( [ gs ] ) and ( [ gr ] ) ,",
    "we have @xmath42    it is known from the investigation theory of stability of regulation circuits that the system is stable if the roots of the characteristic equation are negative or have negative real parts if they are complex conjugate .",
    "this means they are located left of the imaginary axis of the complex @xmath32-plane of the roots . in the case of frequency methods of evaluating the stability we transform the plane of the roots @xmath32 into the complex plane @xmath41 while the transformation is realised according to the transfer function of the open circuit . during the transformation",
    "all the roots of the characteristic equation are mapped from the @xmath32-plane into the critical point @xmath43 in the plane @xmath41 .",
    "the mapping of the @xmath32-plane into plane @xmath41 is conformal , that is , the directions and locations of points in the @xmath32-plane are preserved also in the plane @xmath41 .    in the nyquist frequency characteristic to find out the stability of the control circuit , it is necessary to investigate the behavior of the curve @xmath41 for @xmath44 relative to the critical point @xmath45 .",
    "based on the above it follows that also the fractional - order control circuit is stable , if the frequency characteristic passes on the right side of the critical point , when going in the direction of increasing values @xmath39 .",
    "if the frequency characteristic passes on the left of the critical point , the circuit is non - stable .",
    "the passing of the frequency characteristic through the critical point means the circuit is on the border of stability .",
    "we give in this section an example of modelling the stable dynamical system by using fractional calculus in frequency domain .",
    "the fractional - order control system consists of the real controlled system with the frequency transfer function @xmath46 and the fractional - order @xmath31 controller , designed on the stability measure @xmath47 and damping measure @xmath48 , with the frequency transfer function in the form : @xmath49    0.5 mm    figure 2:nyquist plot ( and details ) for ( [ sys ] ) and ( [ cont ] )    figure 3:bode plots for ( [ sys ] ) and ( [ cont ] )    5 mm in fig . 2 and fig . 3",
    "are showed the frequency characteristics of the fractional - order control system consists of the fractional - order controlled object ( [ sys ] ) and the fractional - order controller ( [ cont ] ) .",
    "the above methods make it possible to model and analyse fractional - order control systems in the frequency domain .",
    "the stability of a fractional - order control system can be investigated via the behavior of the frequency plot ( see fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 ) . these properties of the fractional - order systems can be used in the controller parameters design .",
    "the results of this and previous works also show that fractional - order controllers are robust .",
    "this can even lead to qualitatively different dynamical phenomena in control circuits .",
    "this work was partially supported by grant _ fractional - order dynamical systems and controllers : discrete and frequency - domain models and algorithms _ from austrian institute for east and south - east europe and partially supported by grant vega 1/7098/20 from the slovak agency for science .",
