    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocol is the only physically secure method for the distribution of a secret key between two distant partners ( called _ alice _ and _ bob _ ) .",
    "the physical secure comes from the well - known facts that an attacker ( called _ eve _ ) can not measure an unknown quantum state without modifies the state itself , and she can not duplicate the state and forward a perfect copy to bob .",
    "the facts are proved by two principles , `` uncertainty principle '' and `` no cloning theorem '' .",
    "bb84 protocol @xcite is the first single - photon qkd protocols , which use a random string of signal states which , for example , can be realized as single photons in horizontal , vertical , right circular or left circular polarization states .    in recent years",
    ", several long - distance implementations of bb84 protocol have been developed , that use photons as information carriers and optical fibers as quantum channels .",
    "most often alice sends to bob a coherent weak laser pulse in which she has encoded the bit . in weak pulses qkd system , there are the pulses which contains more than one photon with non - negligible probability .",
    "it implies that for these pulses eve no longer limited by `` no cloning theorem '' , and she can perform new types of attacks to obtain the secret key without introducing errors . in such the attacks , there are photon number splitting ( pns ) attacks @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "although pns attacks are far beyond today s technology , if one includes them in the security analysis , the consequences are dramatic and long - distance weak laser pulse qkd systems no longer have physical security .    in this paper , we propose a new qkd protocol robust against pns attacks , achieved by alternative of bb84 protocol and sarg protocol @xcite .",
    "the protocol is more secure than both of bb84 protocol and sarg protocol , especially long - distance weak laser pulses qkd systems .",
    "the advantage of this protocol is that it is easy to implement , just because it is composed of an existing quantum key distribution system , where the classical sifting procedure is only changed which is easier than making a perfect single - photon source .",
    "our protocol uses four quantum states @xmath0 such that @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "the four states are also used by bb84 protocol and sarg protocol . @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the eigenvectors of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with eigenvalue @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "our protocol contains following phases ;    1 .",
    "quantum communication phase + alice selects randomly one of four states @xmath10 and sends @xmath11 to bob .",
    "bob measures either @xmath7 or @xmath8 , and gets a state @xmath12 .",
    "we call @xmath11 and @xmath13 _ raw keys_. 2 .   selecting annoucement phase + alice performs a procedure , in which she obtains @xmath14 with the probability @xmath15 , and @xmath16 with the probability @xmath17 , and she gets @xmath18 .",
    "the probability @xmath15 is determined uniquely by the length of fiber and @xmath19 . if @xmath20 , go to step 3 - 1 and 4 - 1 , and otherwise , go to step 3 - 2 and 4 - 2 .",
    "classical announcement phase ( for @xmath20 ) + alice announces publicly a pair of two states @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it means that alice announces a pair of orthogonal states .",
    "4 .   sifting and decoding phase ( for @xmath20 ) + when @xmath24 , they get bits , called _ sifted keys _ , from @xmath11 and @xmath13 with the convention that @xmath25 and @xmath26 code for @xmath14 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 code for @xmath16 . + when @xmath29 , they discard their raw keys . 5 .   classical announcement phase ( for @xmath30 ) + alice selects randomly one of two pairs of states @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 and @xmath31 , and announces publicly @xmath32 to bob .",
    "it means that alice announces a pair of nonorthogonal states .",
    "6 .   sifting and decoding phase ( for @xmath30 ) + when @xmath29 , bob obtains @xmath33 from @xmath13 , such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and they get sifted keys from @xmath11 and @xmath33 with the convention that @xmath5 code for @xmath14 and @xmath6 code for @xmath16 .",
    "+ when @xmath24 , they discard their raw keys .    bb84 is described as the proposed protocol with @xmath36 , and sarg is same as this protocol with @xmath37 .",
    "in weak pulses qkd system , alice sends to bob a weak laser pulse in which she has encoded the bit . each pulse is a priori in a coherent state of weak intensity , which can be rewritten as a mixture of fock states , @xmath38 , with the number @xmath39 of photons distributed according to the poissonian statistics of mean @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "consider now the implementation of the proposed protocol with weak pulses .",
    "bob s detector is triggered with probability , taking into account intensities of weak laser pulses , channel losses and imperfect detection efficiencies .",
    "then , in the absence of eve , bob s raw detection rate , which is the probability that he detects a photon per pulse sent by alice , is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the quantum efficiency of a detector and @xmath44 is the channel transmission .    in this case , if we endow eve with unlimited technological power within the laws of quantum physics , the following attacks , named a _ storage attack _ and an _ intercept resend with unambiguous discrimination attack _ ( shortly an _ irud attack _ ) , are possible in principle @xcite .",
    "( we will explain details of these attacks later . )",
    "if alice and bob are connected by a lossy channel ( @xmath45 ) and eve has a lossless channel ( @xmath46 ) which connects alice and bob , eve performs either attacks on a fraction @xmath47 of pulses , that is , she tries as follows :    1 .   eve performs a procedure , in which she obtains @xmath14 with the probability @xmath47 and @xmath16 with the probability @xmath48 .",
    "when she gets @xmath16 , she only forwards the pulse to bob using her lossless channel .",
    "when she gets @xmath14 , she performs one of the two pns attacks .",
    "the attack probability @xmath47 depends on both a type of her attack and the length of lossy channel , such that alice and bob do not notice any change in the expected raw rate and eve remains undetected .",
    "we will explain the procedure of a storage attack @xcite in the following .    1 .",
    "eve counts the number of photons in the pulse , using photon number quantum nondemolition measurement .",
    "if the pulse contains only one photon , eve discards the photon .",
    "when eve detects that it is a multiphoton pulse , she keeps one of the photons in a quantum memory and forwards the remaining photons to bob , using a perfectly transparent quantum channel , @xmath46 .",
    "3 .   by the information in classical announcement phase , eve correspondingly measures the photon stored in her quantum memory .",
    "when eve applies a storage attack on a fraction @xmath47 of the pulses , bob s raw detection rate is @xmath49 by lemma [ lemma : info ] , her mutual information of the key is @xmath50 where @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "eve is now faced with the problem of detecting two states ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , having an overlap @xmath55 .",
    "then she applies the measurement maximizing her information , obtaining @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "[ lemma : info ]    given @xmath44 , eve chooses @xmath47 such that @xmath58 and her mutual information of the sifted key is @xmath59      an encoded pulse containing three photons is rewritten as one of the four states @xmath60 in this case , there exist four orthogonal states of three qubits , @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we can perform a measurement @xmath63 , that distinguishes unambiguously among @xmath64 , with a probability of success @xmath65",
    ".    we will explain the procedure of an irud attack @xcite in the following .    1 .",
    "eve measures the number of photons and discards a pulse containing less than three photons .",
    "2 .   on the pulse containing at least three photons",
    ", eve performs the measurement @xmath63 .",
    "if the result is conclusive , she sends a new photon prepared in the good state to bob using a perfectly transparent quantum channel .",
    "if not conclusive , eve discards the result and the pulse .",
    "when eve applies the irud attack on a fraction @xmath66 of the pulses , bob s raw detection rate and eve s mutual information are @xmath67 and @xmath68    when eve chooses @xmath47 such that @xmath69 , her mutual information of the sifted key is @xmath70",
    "in this section , we evaluate security against pns attacks with @xmath71 . in proposed protocol , the sifted key rate , which is the probability that alice and bob share a sifted key per a pulse , is given by @xmath72    it is easy to see that security against pns attacks will be decreasing the sifted key rate .",
    "therefore , we shall evaluate a security under the condition that a sifted key rate is constant regardless of the selecting probability @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "then , we change @xmath40 to @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the mean photon number when using bb84 protocol . in this paper",
    ", we use a typical value @xmath75 .        consider alice and bob share a secret key using weal laser pulse qkd system and our proposed protocol .",
    "they choose the selecting parameter @xmath15 @xmath78 to minimize eve s mutual information of the shared key .",
    "when eve performs only the storage attack , the best paramter is @xmath37 , that is , they use sarg protocol . on the other hand ,",
    "when eve performs the irud attack , the best is @xmath36 , that is , they use bb84 protocol .            .",
    "if @xmath87 , they only use @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath88 , they increase @xmath15 shown in the dotted line . comparing with figure [ fig : pns ] , our protocol is more secure against pns attacks than both of two protocols .",
    ", width=321 ]    . if @xmath87 , they only use @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath88 , they increase @xmath15 shown in the dotted line . comparing with figure [ fig : pns ] , our protocol is more secure against pns attacks than both of two protocols . , width=321 ]              at figure [ fig : pns ] , we show eve s maximal mutual information of a sifted key when she performs either of two pns attacks , as a function of the communication distance .",
    "we use typical values @xmath100 , @xmath101}$ ] and @xmath102}$ ] , where @xmath103 is the length of the fiber .",
    "we say that , in the case of @xmath104 , the proposed protocol with @xmath105 is better than sarg protocol because @xmath106 .",
    "second , consider that alice and bob choose @xmath15 to minimize eve s mutual information when she performs the most convenient pns attack , in which her mutual information is @xmath107 by figure [ fig : opt ] , we can say that , by choosing an optimal @xmath15 , the ultimate limit of robustness is shifted from @xmath108 , which is the ultimate limit of sarg protocol , to @xmath109 , which is the longest record among experimental qkd systems in the world .",
