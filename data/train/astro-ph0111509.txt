    "cosmological microlensing was first discussed by chang & refsdal  ( 1979 ) , gott  ( 1981 ) and young  ( 1981 ) who pointed out that the relative motion between stars in other galaxies and background sources should cause variability in the observed flux , providing an avenue to investigate an otherwise inaccessible mass regime .",

    "this can be attributed to the fact that the highest values of @xmath0 occur for image positions inside the einstein radius , where the image magnification drops substantially . in the case of microlensing by stars ,",
    "the most likely value of @xmath0 near the line - of sight is insensitive to @xmath115 .",
    "however , an @xmath115 of 0.5 reduces the total amount of microlensing by a factor of two , which reflects the importance of the contribution of multiple images to the statistics of microlensing by stars . for cdm halos , where @xmath176 is monotonic and the magnification of the central image is finite , large values of @xmath0 are significantly more common as a result magnification bias . because we have assumed an nfw profile , which has a low central density compared with an isothermal sphere ,",
    "there are few multiply imaged sources .",
    "however these sources are significantly magnified .",
    "luminosity functions with large values of @xmath115 therefore significantly increase the likelihood of observing a source through a region of large microlensing optical depth .",
    "this can be seen from the spikes in the distributions in fig .",
    "[ nfw_bias ] ( for @xmath177 ) . in this case (",
    "source at redshift 3 ) , the probability of a large value of @xmath0 can be increased more than 100 times in the presence of a magnification bias due to a luminosity function with a large @xmath115 . the spikes in the distribution",
    "may be understood as follows . in the absence of magnification bias , radial depletion of images",
    "occurs near the einstein radius where the source position lies near the optical axis , and at the critical radius for multiple imaging where radial arcs form . at both",
    "radii the large magnifications associated with the depletions result in local probabilities that are very sensitive to the source luminosity function .",
    "furthermore , the einstein radius and the critical radius for multiple imaging are found in the region where the profile is approximately isothermal .",
    "the values of @xmath0 near these radii are therefore nearly constant with @xmath10 , resulting in the narrow peaks seen in fig .",
    "[ nfw_bias ] .",
    "the increase in the total probability for microlensing due to magnification bias ( @xmath115 ) is only about 50 percent , demonstrating that multiple images are not a significant contributer to the microlensing statistics for nfw halos .",
    "the microlensing optical depth can be computed for objects distributed randomly in co - moving volume ( press & gunn  1973 ; turner , ostriker & gott  1984 ) .",
    "for comparison with our probability distributions , we have therefore computed the values of @xmath178 that result from the redistribution of stellar and galactic halo mass uniformly in space .",
    "for uniformly distributed matter the differential distributions for microlensing optical depth analogous to those computed in this paper are delta functions at @xmath178 , and the resulting cumulative distributions are step functions .",
    "these distributions are plotted ( light lines ) in figs .",
    "[ sisell1]-[nfw_bias ] . in both the cases of microlensing by stars and by dark matter , the clustering results in a probability distribution for @xmath0 whose mode is smaller than @xmath178 .",
    "this is expected since in the limit of high clustering , all lines of sight have zero optical depth to microlensing . however , the distributions have significant probability spread over several orders of magnitude in @xmath0 , including a long tail extending to large @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "microlensing by stars in galaxies is much more likely ( @xmath179 percent ) to be observed in images that have @xmath0 s near the line of sight larger than @xmath178 ( with a most likely value around 1 ) .",
    "the coincidence of multiple imaging and large values of @xmath0 ( which doubles the chances of observing an image with @xmath0 ) , as well as the presence of smooth ( dark ) matter results in a microlensing rate for stars that is about a factor of 3 larger than that due to a uniform microlens distribution .",
    "in contrast , microlensing in galactic dark matter halos is most likely to be observed with @xmath0 s near the line of sight that are smaller than @xmath178 , although the mode lies atop a very broad peak .",
    "this results in a fraction of microlensed sources that ( depending on magnification bias ) is lower by nearly a factor of 2 than for uniformly distributed microlenses .",
    "probability distributions were computed for the microlensing optical depth @xmath0 due both to microlensing by stars in galaxies , and , assuming dark matter to be in the form of compact objects , by microlenses in the dark halos around galaxies .",
    "these distributions were contrasted with the values of @xmath0 in universes having uniformly distributed microlenses .",
    "around 1 percent of high - redshift sources are microlensed by stars at any one time . in keeping with the strong lensing rate",
    ", incidences of microlensing by stars will be higher in elliptical / s0 than spiral galaxies .",
    "interestingly , multiply - imaged sources dominate the stellar microlensing statistics , with less than 50 percent of microlensing by stars being of singly imaged ( by the galaxy ) sources .",
    "our model suggests that in spiral galaxies , about 30 percent of microlensing will be in single images , and that these will be mostly located in the disk , with microlensed multiple images being located in the bulge .",
    "however if cdm halos are comprised of compact objects , then more than @xmath169 high redshift source in 10 is microlensed at any one time .",
    "in addition , the vast majority of these sources are not multiply - imaged . where compact objects are distributed in dark galactic halos , the simple calculation of microlensing probability from uniformly distributed objects provides reasonable results ( to within a factor of 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , the typical @xmath0 near lines of sight to microlensed images in dark matter halos will usually be comparable to or lower than the uniform value .",
    "in contrast , for microlensing by stars the typical optical depth is significantly larger than in the uniform case . even more importantly , microlensing by stars",
    "will usually be observed at optical depths of order 1 ."
