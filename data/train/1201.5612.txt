    "the theory of measurements in quantum physics has a long tradition .",
    "first , it requires a good understanding of the measurement devices . in quantum optics ,",
    "the foundations for the photodetector have been established in the pioneering works of mandel  @xcite , kelley and kleiner  @xcite as well as glauber  @xcite . on this basis ,",
    "more elaborate measurement techniques have been developed , such as balanced homodyne detection  @xcite , unbalanced homodyne detection  @xcite and eight - port homodyne detection schemes  @xcite .",
    "all mentioned schemes provide the possibility to collect information to completely characterize an arbitrary quantum state of light .",
    "once , the experimental techniques are well - known , one needs suitable tomographic methods to convert the raw experimental data into a convenient representation of the quantum state . in case of balanced homodyne measurements , in which one records phase dependent quadratures",
    ", there are several approaches which have been proposed . in  @xcite",
    ", the so - called inverse radon transform is applied to estimate the wigner function of the quantum state .",
    "this approach can also be generalized to obtain different quasiprobability distributions , such as the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0 function  @xcite . in order to calculate density matrices , one may choose between fourier techniques  @xcite , direct sampling schemes  @xcite or more involved maximum likelihood methods  @xcite .",
    "however , there has only been little interest in the statistical properties of quantum state estimation .",
    "the theoretical foundations have already been considered in  @xcite , but in particular for quantum state tomography , the statistical uncertainties of the estimates are not examined deeply .",
    "first examinations have been performed in  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the sampling approach is that it directly gives an simple estimate of the statistical uncertainty of the estimated quantity  @xcite , which we will shortly review below . in case of the maximum likelihood approach",
    ", statistical uncertainties can be evaluated by the inverse of the so - called fisher information matrix , which requires some numerical effort  @xcite .",
    "alternative methods for the estimation of uncertainties can also be found in  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we compare the statistical uncertainty , which arises in the direct sampling approach , to the quantum mechanical variance , which provides a lower bound set by the quantum nature of light . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider functions of a single observable , which can be directly measured , and show that the variance of the corresponding pattern function equals to the quantum mechanical one . in sec .",
    "iii , we examine observables for which complete quantum state tomography is required .",
    "explicitly , we show that sampling from balanced homodyne detection data does not operate on the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty , and find that the statistical independence of quadratures at different phases is the reason .",
    "we also discuss the estimation of phase - space distributions in sec .",
    "iv , and show that the unbalanced homodyne detection scheme provides estimates with quantum mechanical uncertainties .",
    "section v is dedicated to an example in quantum state tomography to illustrate the impact of the results .",
    "as a first step , let us assume that we observe a single physical quantity @xmath1 and estimate the expectation value of a function of this observable , @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath2 is a hermitian operator , it can be written in its spectral decomposition @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an eigenvector of @xmath1 with the eigenvalue @xmath5 .",
    "the set @xmath6 is the set of all eigenvalues . in case of discrete eigenvalues ,",
    "the integration has to be replaced by the corresponding sum .",
    "the eigenvectors can be chosen orthogonal , @xmath7 where the right hand side has to be interpreted as the kronecker symbol in the case of discrete eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , the eigenstates provide a resolution of identity , @xmath8    let us now consider an experiment which records a set of @xmath9 eigenvalues @xmath10 from @xmath6 as outcomes .",
    "the underlying quantum state shall be denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "then , the _ empirical expectation value _ of some function @xmath12 can be estimated as @xmath13 the tilde indicates that this quantity is a random number , since it is obtained from measured ( and therefore random ) values @xmath10 , whose probabilities shall be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the expectation value of this random number @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 as above , the integral has to be seen as a sum over the probabilities if the set of eigenvalues is discrete .",
    "the key point is now that eq .",
    "provides a good estimate for the _ quantum mechanical expectation value _ of the operator @xmath2 .",
    "the probabilities of the outcomes are connected to the underlying quantum state by @xmath17 inserting this into eq .   and applying  , we find @xmath18 the eqs .  , and   form the basis of the sampling technique . in order to find an unbiased estimate of the expectation value of @xmath2 , one simply has to insert his measurement outcomes @xmath10 into the so - called pattern function @xmath12 and calculate the empirical mean @xmath19 of the values according to eq .  .    for the ability to make justified statements ,",
    "one still needs a measure of the uncertainty of the estimate  .",
    "the _ empirical variance of the sampling points _",
    "@xmath20 is given by @xmath21 this number quantifies the spreading of the points @xmath22 .",
    "the factor @xmath23 guarantees that the estimate is unbiased , i.e. @xmath24 ^ 2 da.\\ ] ] practically , the estimation of the empirical variance requires the calculation of the second moment of @xmath12 , @xmath25 we easily see that this is exactly the sampling equation  , just with the square of the function @xmath12 . therefore , and due to the orthogonality of the eigenstates @xmath4",
    ", its expectation value again equals to the quantum mechanical one , @xmath26 the same holds for arbitrary moments of the function @xmath12 . as a consequence , also the _ quantum mechanical variance _ of @xmath2 , @xmath27 ^ 2\\ } - [ { \\rm tr}\\{\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{f}(\\hat{a})\\}]^2\\ ] ] can be estimated without bias from the set of sampling points @xmath20 : @xmath28 finally , we are interested in the statistical uncertainty on the estimate  . from estimation theory , this is just the empirical variance @xmath29 of the sampling points , divided by the number of measurements : @xmath30 the factor @xmath31 guarantees that for an increasing number of data points @xmath9 , the uncertainty of the empirical mean value is decreasing . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the latter approaches stochastically the quantum mechanical expectation value .    in conclusion",
    ", we may estimate the quantum mechanical expectation value of the operator @xmath2 by the sampling equation  , and the variance of @xmath19 is exactly expected to match the quantum mechanical variance @xmath33 , divided by the number of data points . in this sense , we may state that the determination of @xmath34 can be done on the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty .",
    "there are no other sources of noise contributing to the uncertainty , and it is not possible to achieve less fluctuations with classical statistical means .",
    "we emphasize that so far we only considered a function of the directly measurable operator @xmath1 , making this result possible .",
    "after briefly discussing some examples , we show that the situation becomes completely different when we require several non - commuting observables to estimate the expectation value of an operator @xmath35 .      as a first example , let us consider the measurement of the quadrature operator @xmath36 , which is frequently done in balanced homodyne measurements . in this case , the set of eigenvalues is given by the continuous spectrum @xmath37 .",
    "according to the above calculations , any function of a single quadrature can be estimated at the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty .",
    "this includes all kinds of moments of the quadrature , for instance normally ordered ones .",
    "however , note that we only may use a quadrature at a single phase .",
    "if we consider functions of quadratures of different phases , the situation will become completely different , as we will show below .",
    "photon number resolving detectors can record the outcomes of the photon number operator @xmath38 . here",
    ", the set of eigenvalues is the discrete spectrum @xmath39 .",
    "again , we can state that the expectation value of any function of the photon number operator can be estimated at the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty .",
    "we still note that in practice one can only record a finite number of measurements , leading to some uncertainty on photon number probabilities with very low values , which typically occur for very large photon numbers .",
    "however , this problem can be minimized by increasing the number of measurements .",
    "measurements of a single operator , such as the quadrature or the photon number , can not characterize a quantum state completely .",
    "for some operators , one needs more information about the state in order to estimate some expectation value .",
    "for instance , measurements of the quadrature distributions for all phases in @xmath40 are informationally complete  @xcite , and we may calculate any expectation value from this measurement outcomes . on the other hand , it has been shown that so - called quasiprobability representations of quantum states can be retrieved by photon number resolved measurements , when one displaces the quantum state in phase space before the measurement  @xcite . in the following , we consider these methods more in detail .      for having a meaningful reference ,",
    "we start with the calculation of the quantum mechanical variance of some operator @xmath35 . here , we express it in terms of the characteristic functions of the wigner function of the density operator @xmath11 of the state and of the observable @xmath35 . in general , the characteristic function of the wigner function is defined as @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the well - known displacement operator  @xcite . for hermitian operators , we have the relation @xmath43 . moreover , if @xmath35 is the density operator of a state , we will omit the index of @xmath44 throughout the paper .",
    "conversely , the operator may be retrieved from its characteristic function by @xmath45 with these quantities at hand , we may calculate the expectation value of @xmath35 with respect to the state @xmath11 by @xmath46 let us now express the second moment of @xmath35 in terms of characteristic functions .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "for the operator @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath47 by applying the equality @xmath48 and writing both integrals in polar coordinates , we find the final expression @xmath49 in our notation , the integrals over the angles @xmath50 range from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , while the integration over @xmath53 covers the full real line .",
    "the variance can then be easily calculated as @xmath54 ^ 2.\\label{eq : var : f}\\ ] ] equation   will be the reference for comparison with the variance arising in sampling methods .",
    "let us assume that the state @xmath11 is sent to a balanced homodyne detector  @xcite , recording quadrature values @xmath55 at different phases @xmath56 . here",
    ", we assume that the phase values are uniformly distributed within this interval .",
    "then , the quadrature @xmath57 follows the quadrature distribution @xmath58 , which is conditioned on the value of @xmath59 .",
    "the joint probability distribution is given by @xmath60 .",
    "sampling is an established technique to estimate the expectation value of an hermitian operator @xmath35 from this set of data by an empirical mean of a suitable pattern function @xmath61 , @xmath62 analogously to eq .",
    ", this number @xmath19 is a random variable , whose expectation value is given by @xmath63 the pattern function has to be designed such that this expectation value equals to the quantum mechanical one , @xmath64 let us now find such a suitable pattern function belonging to the operator @xmath35 .",
    "the characteristic function of the state is connected to the quadrature distribution as @xmath65 inserting this equation into eq .   and writing the integration over @xmath66 in polar coordinates , we obtain @xmath67 from this relation , we easily see that the pattern function is given by @xmath68 by construction , the expectation value of this pattern function with respect to the joint quadrature distributions @xmath60 always equals to the quantum mechanical expectation value , see eq .",
    ".    moreover , we are interested in the empirical variance of the single data points , which can be estimated from the experimental data by @xmath69 being completely analogous to eq .  .",
    "consequently , the expectation value of this variance is given by @xmath70 ^ 2 } - \\overline{f(x,\\varphi)}^2.\\label{eq : pattern : variance}\\ ] ] finally , the variance of the estimate @xmath71 for the expectation value of the operator @xmath72 can be obtained from @xmath73 this number quantifies the uncertainty of the estimate  .",
    "let us now examine if we can expect the empirical variance eq .   to match the quantum mechanical variance of the operator @xmath72 .",
    "contrarily to the procedure above , the operator @xmath72 now depends on quadratures at different phases @xmath74 , whose operators do not commute . for getting a deeper understanding",
    ", we concentrate on the second moment of @xmath75 . by using the inverse relation of eq .",
    ", @xmath76 we find @xmath77 ^ 2\\\\      & = & \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2 } \\int dx\\ , d\\varphi\\ , db\\ , db'\\ , db''\\,|b'||b''| e^{i(b'+b''-b)x}\\nonumber\\\\&&\\times \\phi(i b e^{i\\varphi})\\phi^*_{\\hat{f}}(i b ' e^{i\\varphi } )       \\phi^*_{\\hat{f}}(i b ''",
    "e^{i\\varphi}).\\label{eq : expect : f2:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we substitute @xmath78 in order to remove the imaginary unit @xmath79 in the arguments of the characteristic function .",
    "a careful analysis shows that we do not have to change the integration domain due to the periodicity of the integrand .",
    "moreover , the integral over @xmath80 can be evaluated as @xmath81 which can be used to evaluate another integral in : @xmath82 together with eq .",
    ", we find the theoretically expected variance of the sampling method .",
    "we stress that this equation is not directly evaluated in practice , since the underlying quadrature distribution is unknown , and we only have a sample of quadrature measurements @xmath83 .",
    "instead , we use the empirical variance given in eq .  .",
    "however , the theoretical expectation is given by eq .",
    "in combination with eq .   and and the basis for all following considerations .",
    "let us compare the quantum mechanical variance   with the variance expected from the sampling method  .",
    "since the first moments of the sampling method and quantum mechanics are equal by construction , it is sufficient to examine the second moments of @xmath84 and @xmath35 .",
    "the expressions from the sampling method and the quantum mechanical calculation look quite similar , but they are different : in , one integration over @xmath85 is missing .",
    "a closer look reveals that if one replaces @xmath86 in the quantum mechanical expectation , one finds the expression for the pattern function .",
    "obviously , since we only observe the quadrature distribution @xmath87 at a fixed phase @xmath74 , and all measured quadratures for different @xmath74 are stochastically independent , the `` correlations '' of the quadrature distributions between different phases @xmath74 and @xmath85 are not taken into consideration .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath87 is not the joint distribution of all quadratures , whose marginals are the observed quadrature distributions .",
    "the definition of the joint distribution suffers from the problem of the non - commutativity of the corresponding quadrature operators and is closely related to the different phase - space distributions . as a consequence ,",
    "the quantum mechanical variance is not equal to the empirical variance of the pattern function . in this sense ,",
    "the statistics of the balanced homodyne measurements is not at the quantum mechanical level , since the expectation value of @xmath35 can not be estimated with quantum mechanical uncertainty .",
    "the definition of a joint probability of two quadratures suffers from the problem of the non - commutativity of two quadratures for different phases . in this context there",
    "appear similar problems as the well known ambiguity of the definition of phase - space distributions .",
    "we also note that the statement does not change when the examined operator is phase - insensitive , i.e.   @xmath88 in this case , it is sufficient to record the completely phase - diffused quadrature distribution @xmath89 which can be easily done by choosing a uniform phase distribution of the local oscillator coherent state .",
    "this scheme may be practically more simple , since one does not have to record the phase values .",
    "however , it is still necessary to guarantee the uniform phase distribution in  .",
    "moreover , it does not bring any statistical benefit , since the variance   of the pattern function remains the same .",
    "therefore , the same number of data points is required to obtain the same statistical precision .",
    "finally , we might ask if it is possible to experimentally construct a bipartite state described by the characteristic function @xmath90 , which appears in eq .  .",
    "the arguments @xmath91 and @xmath92 are assigned to each of the two subsystems .",
    "if this was possible , one could use it for estimating the quantum mechanical variance from eq .  .",
    "practically , we would need to measure joint quadrature distributions @xmath93 which seems to require joint balanced homodyne measurements on the bipartite state .",
    "the problem is just that @xmath90 does not refer to a physical state .",
    "this becomes clear when we examine the covariance matrix .",
    "the required moments can be obtained by taking the derivatives of @xmath90 at @xmath94 .",
    "we note that all moments of the bipartite state can be expressed in moments of the state @xmath44 , since @xmath95 therefore , if the state described by @xmath44 has a quadrature covariance matrix @xmath96 the bipartite state can be characterized by the matrix @xmath97 in order to describe a physical state , this matrix has to satisfy the nonnegativity condition  @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 however , the @xmath100 minors of @xmath101 are always negative , e.g. @xmath102 therefore , eq .   is violated by the covariance matrix @xmath101 of the bipartite characteristic function @xmath90 , and @xmath90 can never correspond to a physical quantum state , which could be generated in an experiment . as a consequence",
    ", it seems unfeasible to estimate the variance   on the quantum mechanical level .",
    "next , we consider a more general setting .",
    "first , we assume that we look at a family of observables @xmath103 , being constructed by a coherent displacement of some initial operator @xmath35 : @xmath104 the characteristic function of these operators is given by @xmath105     with a coherent state . ]",
    "furthermore , we also apply the displacement to the state @xmath11 , but we look at a suitable experimental realization .",
    "let us send the initial state , described by @xmath106 , to a beamsplitter with real transmissivity @xmath107 and reflectivity @xmath108 , satisfying @xmath109 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) . at the second input of the beamsplitter , we irradiate a coherent state with amplitude @xmath110 , described by its characteristic function @xmath111 the resulting output state has the characteristic function @xmath112 we have chosen the amplitude of the coherent state such that the reflectivity does not appear in all calculations .",
    "note that the transmissivity @xmath107 can also be used for taking the detector quantum efficiency into account .",
    "it is well known that an imperfect detector with efficiency @xmath113 can be modelled by first mixing the input state with a fraction of @xmath114 of vacuum and subsequently performing the measurement with an ideal detector .",
    "the transmissivity of the corresponding beamsplitter is given by @xmath115 . by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : mix : input : with : coh ] ) on the state @xmath116 with transmissivity @xmath117 and coherent state amplitude @xmath118 , we find @xmath119 therefore , an imperfect detector can be simply taken into account by replacing the transmissivity @xmath107 of the beam splitter by the effective transmissivity @xmath120 . in consequence , we may consider only ideal detectors .",
    "of course , the expectation value of the pattern function corresponding to @xmath121 with respect to the new output state is exactly the quantum mechanical expectation again .",
    "let us look at the second moment of the pattern function , by inserting eq .   and into :    @xmath122",
    "we focus on the following aspect : we want to estimate the quantum mechanical expectation value of the operator @xmath123 with respect to the initial state . for this purpose",
    ", we have two possibilities :    1 .   we do not displace the initial state and omit the beamsplitter .",
    "mathematically , this is given by @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath123 is obtained by choosing the pattern function corresponding to @xmath123 , i.e.  by suitable calculations after the balanced homodyne measurement .",
    "we displace the state by @xmath126 .",
    "the calculations after the measurement only require the pattern function for @xmath35 , i.e.  we set @xmath127 in eq .  .",
    "the expectation value of the sampling procedure is in both cases the same , namely the quantum mechanical expectation .",
    "however , the uncertainties differ : in the second case , the initial state enters as @xmath128 , which is the state after exposition to losses with @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , we may expect a worse result than in the first scheme , which only depends on the perfect state .",
    "this finding also holds when we consider imperfect detection : if the quantum efficiency of the balanced homodyne detector equals to @xmath130 , we had to replace @xmath131 in the first case and @xmath132 in the second case .",
    "therefore , the beamsplitter which displaces the initial state introduces unavoidable losses .",
    "this has consequences for the discussion of quantum state tomography .",
    "in the case of quantum state tomography , one is interested to find a complete representation of the quantum state . here",
    ", we discuss the representation with means of quasiprobabilities . in many cases ,",
    "these quasiprobabilities can be represented as the expectation value of a displaced operator @xmath35 , which is phase - insensitive : @xmath133 the coefficients @xmath134 in the fock basis expansion of @xmath35 , @xmath135 determine a specific quasiprobability .",
    "for instance , the wigner function is obtained by choosing @xmath136 , while the @xmath137 function arises from @xmath138 .",
    "more generally , the coefficients of @xmath139-ordered quasiprobabilities  @xcite can be written as @xmath140 with @xmath141 being the @xmath142th laguerre - polynomial .",
    "for the family of @xmath143-parameterized quasiprobabilities , one chooses @xmath144 , for nonclassicality quasiprobabilities one uses a suitable nonclassicality filter  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed different techniques for estimating expectation values of the form  .",
    "first , we notice that the so - called cascaded balanced homodyning technique  @xcite does not provide any advantage over the standard balanced homodyne detection .",
    "the former corresponds to the method 2 described in the previous section , where one displaces the state and estimates @xmath35 for @xmath127 , while the latter is realized by the method 1 .",
    "obviously , the former suffers a reduction of the quantum efficiency by the transmissivity of the first beamsplitter .",
    "this is not affected by the fact that @xmath35 is phase - independent , and recording of the phase values is not required in the cascaded measurement .",
    "one can only improve the situation by choosing a beamsplitter with high transmissivity .",
    "second , we note that balanced homodyne measurements followed by sampling of quasiprobabilities does not work on the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty .",
    "therefore , we can not expect that this scheme is optimal for this purpose .",
    "indeed , if one is interested in quasiprobabilities , there is a better alternative : the unbalanced homodyne detection technique is based on a different interpretation of eq .  :",
    "first , the quantum state is displaced in the same way described in sec .",
    "[ sec : displacement : and : operators ] .",
    "afterwards , the expectation value of the phase - independent operator @xmath35 is sampled from photon number measurements . since this",
    "only requires the measurement of a single observable , namely the photon number , the estimation of the quasiprobability at a specific point @xmath145 is performed on the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty .",
    "provided that the balanced homodyne detector and the photon number resolved detector had the same quantum efficiency , we recommend to choose the latter one , since we expect it to give better results .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the unbalanced scheme is optimal for the estimation of the phase - space representation at fixed points @xmath145 , but does not cover correlations between different points @xmath146 . therefore ,",
    "if one wants to estimate quantities which require the knowledge of the quasiprobability at different @xmath145 , one can not expect to achieve this at the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty as well .",
    "for instance , quadrature distributions are better measured in balanced homodyne detection schemes . in this sense",
    ", the unbalanced measurement is optimal for the estimation of quasiprobabilities , but not always the best in different cases .",
    "to demonstrate the difference of the statistical uncertainty in balanced homodyne and photon - number resolved detection , let us consider the determination of a nonclassicality quasiprobability of a squeezed state  @xcite .",
    "its variances are @xmath147 and @xmath148 , whereas the variance of the vacuum state shall be @xmath149",
    ". we will apply @xmath150 as a filter , with @xmath151 .",
    "the prefactor guarantees that @xmath152 , and the filter width is fixed with @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , the pattern function   is defined by choosing @xmath154 .    for the balanced homodyne detection scheme",
    ", we generate a set of @xmath155 data points , each consisting of a pair @xmath156 .",
    "the phase values @xmath59 are uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath40 , whereas @xmath57 follows the quadrature distribution @xmath157 conditioned on the value of @xmath59 . from this simulated set of data",
    ", we sample the nonclassicality quasiprobability together with its statistical uncertainty . for reasons of simplicity ,",
    "we assume to have an ideal detector , i.e.  @xmath158 .    in case of the unbalanced homodyne detection scheme",
    ", we calculate the photon - number distribution @xmath159 together with its variance theoretically , the maximum photon number is restricted to @xmath160 .",
    "then we derive the statistical uncertainty from the result by means of linear error propagation .     and @xmath148 .",
    "]    . ]    . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : pomega ] shows the nonclassicality quasiprobability .",
    "we observe negativities for some real @xmath145 , being signatures of the nonclassicality of the squeezed state , the minimum is achieved at @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "figures  [ fig : stddev : homo ] and [ fig : stddev : unbalanced ] show the standard deviations @xmath163 and @xmath164 , which are obtained from balanced or unbalanced homodyne measurements respectively .",
    "they are calculated from eq .   and  ,",
    "each divided by the number of measurements @xmath9 .",
    "obviously , they show a completely different behavior .",
    "the uncertainty from balanced homodyne detection is more than a factor of @xmath165 larger than the one from the unbalanced technique , the exact difference depends on the point in phase space and on the examined state . in particular , at @xmath166 , the homodyne measurement provides @xmath167 , leading to an insufficient significance of the negativity of @xmath168 standard deviations .",
    "contrarily , we have @xmath169 in the unbalanced case , leading to a significance of about @xmath170 standard deviations",
    ". therefore , in case of equal quantum efficiency , the unbalanced scheme proves to be much better than the balanced one .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] illustrates this conclusion clearly .",
    "we compared different approaches for estimating the expectation value of some physical quantity with respect to its statistical uncertainty .",
    "first , we showed that whenever one can estimate a quantity of interest as a function of a single operator , which can be directly measured , then the estimate is on the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty , i.e.  the empirical variance equals to the quantum - mechanical one . in practice , this works for quadratures and photon number measurements , for instance .    however , for many operators a direct measurement is not known , and techniques for quantum tomography have to be applied .",
    "we considered sampling methods , which are applied to phase - dependent quadrature data from balanced homodyne measurements .",
    "we show that the cascaded balanced homodyne measurement has no statistical advantage over the standard technique , although the first method only requires a phase - randomized local oscillator .",
    "moreover , both methods do not operate on the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty . on the contrary",
    ", the unbalanced measurement technique can achieve the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty .",
    "therefore , the latter shall be generally the best of the considered methods .",
    "we also identified the main reason for the difference between the variance from balanced homodyne measurement and the quantum mechanical variance : it is due to the fact that quadratures at different phases are always measured stochastically independently . therefore , there seems to be a lack of `` phase correlations '' in the experimental data .",
    "the severe question is how this problem affects other quantum state reconstruction methods , like maximum likelihood techniques  @xcite . in particular , it is unclear if the latter method is able to perform the estimation on the quantum mechanical level .",
    "our results have direct implications to the different approaches for reconstructing quasiprobabilities or density matrices of states .",
    "we showed the advantage of the unbalanced measurement with the example of a nonclassicality quasiprobability of a squeezed state . therefore ,",
    "if photon - counting devices with quantum efficiencies comparable to balanced homodyne detectors will be available in the future , our findings suggest to prefer the unbalanced scheme for quantum state estimation .",

    "<S> in quantum physics , all measured observables are subject to statistical uncertainties , which arise from the quantum nature as well as the experimental technique . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the statistical uncertainty of the so - called sampling method , in which one estimates the expectation value of a given observable by empirical means of suitable pattern functions . we show that if the observable can be written as a function of a single directly measurable operator , the variance of the estimate from the sampling method equals to the quantum mechanical one . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , we say that the estimate is on the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if the observable depends on non - commuting operators , e.g.  different quadratures , the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty is not achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the results on quantum tomography is discussed , and different approaches to quantum tomographic measurements are compared . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown explicitly for the estimation of quasiprobabilities of a quantum state , that balanced homodyne tomography does not operate on the quantum mechanical level of uncertainty , while the unbalanced homodyne detection does . </S>"
