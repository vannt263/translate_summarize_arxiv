    "it is widely believed that the present cosmological observations are consistent with low density cold dark matter ( cdm ) models with scale invariant adiabatic density fluctuations .",
    "the required energy density of non - relativistic matter is about @xmath2% of the critical density ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite experiments on anisotropies of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) strongly suggest that our universe is flat , which is also the prediction of the inflationary universe .",
    "thus , there exists dark energy which fills the gap between @xmath4 and the total energy density @xmath5 .",
    "although usually the dark energy is assumed to be the cosmological constant , a slowly evolving scalar field with positive energy can also account for the dark energy @xcite .",
    "such a scalar field is called quintessence and has been studied by many authors @xcite .    at present ,",
    "the quintessence models are classified into two types ; tracker type @xcite and cosine type @xcite .",
    "the former has an attractor - like solution which explains the present dark energy without fine - tuning of the initial condition , while the latter needs tuning of the initial value of the scalar field .",
    "this is why the tracker type is favored among cosmologists .",
    "however , even for the tracker - type models the model parameters should be fine - tuned to produce the required value of the present quintessence density .",
    "in addition , the potential for the tracker field is very exotic and hard to realize in particle physics models .",
    "one of the observational effects produced by the existence of the quintessence is the cmb anisotropies . in many cases , the quintessence dominates the universe at late times ( @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being redshift ) after the recombination . at that epoch",
    "the gravitational potential is changed because the equation of state for quintessence is different from that for non - relativistic matter , which leads to an enhancement of the cmb anisotropies at large angular scales @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the index of spherical harmonics ) due to the late - time integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite .",
    "the quintessence also changes the locations of the acoustic peaks in the cmb angular power spectrum @xcite because the projection of the horizon at last scattering onto the present sky is enlarged compared with models with the cosmological constant .",
    "furthermore , in the case of cosine - type models , during inflation the quintessence scalar field is effectively massless and has significant quantum fluctuations as large as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "these fluctuations behave as isocurvature mode and hence the quintessence may have both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations .",
    "the isocurvature fluctuations produce adiabatic ones once their wavelengths enter the horizon .",
    "therefore , we expect larger anisotropies in cmb angular spectrum for cosine - type quintessence models . in this paper",
    "we study the cmb anisotropies produced by quintessence models paying attention to the cosine - type quintessence models .",
    "it is shown that the isocurvature fluctuations have significant effects on the cmb angular power spectrum at low multipoles in some parameter space , which may be detectable in future satellite experiments and can be an interesting signal of the cosine - type quintessence models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "zeromode ] , we discuss dynamics of the scalar - field zero mode . in section [ sec : fluctuation ] , behaviors of the fluctuation in the quintessence amplitude are discussed .",

    "thus , for @xmath16 , the energy density and the pressure of the quintessence field are @xmath17 respectively , where the `` dot '' represents the derivative with respect to time @xmath18 .",
    "if the kinetic energy of @xmath19 is negligible compared to the potential energy , the equation of state becomes @xmath20 and the energy - momentum tensor of the quintessence field behaves like that of the cosmological constant .    the zero mode @xmath21 obeys the following equation of motion @xmath22 where the `` prime '' denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath19 . in the very early universe where @xmath23 , the slow - roll condition is satisfied and the motion of @xmath21 is negligible even if @xmath21 is displaced from the minimum of the potential .",
    "if the slow - roll condition is satisfied until today , the equation of state @xmath24 is always very close to @xmath25 and the quintessence is indistinguishable from the cosmological constant .",
    "however , this is not always the case .",
    "if the effective mass of the quintessence may become larger than the expansion rate , @xmath19 starts to move and @xmath24 varies .",
    "in addition , since the quintessence is a dynamical field , its energy density may fluctuate . due to these facts",

    "the angular diameter distance in the quintessence model is , however , different from that in the @xmath32cdm models .",
    "since the quintessence models provides larger total energy density of the universe than the @xmath32cdm models in the earlier epoch , the angular diameter distance in the quintessence model becomes smaller than that in the @xmath32cdm models . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : cl(adi ) ] , the location of the peaks is shifted to lower multipole @xmath9 for the quintessence models . if we take a parameter in the oscillatory region , this feature becomes more prominent .",

    "when the slow - roll condition is satisfied for the quintessence , fluctuation for the scale larger than the horizon scale takes its initial value . on the contrary , for @xmath183 , @xmath105 behaves like an oscillator with frequency @xmath184 , and the fluctuation red - shifts as the universe expands .",
    "due to the red shift , the magnitude of @xmath105 is approximately proportional to @xmath185 and @xmath186 for modes entering the horizon in the matter - dominated and radiation - dominated universe , respectively . if the slow - roll condition is satisfied until the present universe , @xmath99 for @xmath187 is suppressed .",
    "if @xmath188 , however , the quintessence field may start to oscillate at some stage of the universe .",
    "( we call the horizon scale at this epoch as @xmath189 . )",
    "once the quintessence starts to oscillate with frequency @xmath190 , then all the modes universally damps as far as @xmath191 .",
    "thus , for @xmath192 , @xmath105 is independent of @xmath92 . on the contrary ,",
    "modes with @xmath193 acquire extra suppression as we discussed , and @xmath105 for such a small scale becomes smaller . in our analysis",
    "we only consider cases where @xmath194 is close to the present horizon scale . in those cases ,",
    "the isocurvature fluctuation in the quintessence field dominantly affects @xmath140 with small @xmath9 , as we will see below .",
    "= 0.75    in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_q ] , we also plot the scale dependence of the energy density perturbation in the quintessence field normalized by @xmath43 @xmath195 for the isocurvature contribution , the energy density perturbation is dominated by that of the quintessence and hence it induces the metric perturbation @xmath72 .",
    "this becomes a source of the cmb anisotropy through the sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "when the slow - roll condition is satisfied for the quintessence , @xmath196 is approximated as @xmath197 and it changes its behavior at the scale @xmath198 or at @xmath199 , as a consequence of the scale dependence of @xmath105 .",
    ".@xmath200 for several values of @xmath114 .",
    "we take @xmath201 , and ( a ) @xmath202 gev , ( b ) @xmath203 gev , ( c ) @xmath204 gev , ( d ) @xmath205 gev , and ( e ) @xmath206 gev .",
    "notice that the points a @xmath131 e are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now , we consider the cmb anisotropy in the case with the isocurvature mode .",
    "we calculate the cmb anisotropy for various cases , and in table [ table : c2/c10 ] , we show the quadrupole @xmath207 normalized by @xmath208 .    if we limit ourselves to the parameter region which is consistent with the cobe , boomerang , and maxima observations with simple scale - invariant primordial fluctuation , effect of the isocurvature mode is quite small as far as @xmath209 .",
    "this is because , in such cases , there is a severe upper bound on @xmath32 to suppress the late time isw effect which enhances @xmath140 with small @xmath9 .",
    "as a result , the quintessence field can not dominate the universe when @xmath30 .",
    "then , the isocurvature fluctuation in the quintessence density also becomes a minor effect until very recently .",
    "as one can see in table [ table : c2/c10 ] , for the best - fit value of @xmath32 ( i.e. , for the point a given in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] ) , the enhancement of @xmath207 is about 2 % even for @xmath210 . if we consider larger value of @xmath32 , effect on @xmath207 is more enhanced . for @xmath211 ( i.e. , for the point c given in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] , which is allowed at 99 % c.l . )",
    ", we calculate the cmb angular power spectrum and the result is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_2pointc ] . in this case , @xmath207 can be enhanced by the factor 2.6 if @xmath210 .",
    "= 0.75    = 0.75    one should note that angular power spectrum of the cmb anisotropy strongly depends on the primordial spectrum of the fluctuations .",
    "thus , the constraint on the @xmath31 vs.  @xmath32 plane is sensitive to the scale - dependence of the primordial adiabatic fluctuation which is determined by the model of the inflation .",
    "therefore , if we adopt a possibility of a non - trivial scale dependence of the primordial fluctuation , the constraint on the @xmath31 vs.  @xmath32 plane given in the previous section may be relaxed or modified .",
    "if this is the case , larger value of @xmath32 may be allowed and the energy density of the quintessence field may become significant at earlier stage of the universe .",
    "thus , we also consider such cases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_2pointd ] , we plot @xmath140 normalized by @xmath208 for @xmath212 .",
    "in addition , in table [ table : c2/c10 ] , the ratio @xmath200 is shown for the points d and e. as one can see , effect on @xmath207 is much more significant than the previous case .    at low multipoles the uncertainty of the cmb data",
    "is dominated by `` cosmic variance . '' for @xmath207 which is mostly enhanced by the isocurvature fluctuations , the cosmic variance gives @xmath213 error to observation .",
    "thus , it is difficult to see the effect of the isocurvature mode when @xmath209 if the quintessence field does not oscillate so much until the present epoch .",
    "however , if a large value of @xmath32 is possible , the isocurvature effects may be detectable even with @xmath214 , which is realized , for example , in the chaotic inflation model with @xmath215 with @xmath216 ( see , for example , point e in table [ table : c2/c10 ] ) .",
    "we have studied the cmb anisotropies produced by cosine - type quintessence models . in particular , effects of the adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations",
    "have been both discussed .    for purely adiabatic fluctuations with scale invariant spectrum",
    ", the existence of the quintessence suppresses the relative height of the first acoustic peak of the angular power spectrum compared with the @xmath32cdm case .",
    "this is because , in the quintessence models , the `` dark energy '' due to the quintessence may dominate the universe earlier than the cosmological constant case , and hence the late time isw effect becomes more effective . as a result ,",
    "the cmb anisotropy for large angular scale is more enhanced , which relatively suppresses the height of the acoustic peaks .",
    "because of this effect , we have seen that the cmb data from cobe , boomerang and maxima have imposed the stringent constraint on the model parameters of the quintessence models .",
    "we have also seen that the location of the the first acoustic peak shifts to lower multipole @xmath9 compared with @xmath32cdm models .    in the case of the cosine - type quintessence models ,",
    "the quintessence field has a negligible effective mass during inflation and hence its amplitude may acquire sizable fluctuation due to the quantum fluctuation in the de sitter background . such a fluctuation becomes isocurvature fluctuation .",
    "we have shown that the isocurvature fluctuations have significant effects on the cmb angular power spectrum at low multipoles in some parameter space , which may be detectable in future satellite experiments .",
    "this signal may be used to test the cosine - type tracker model , combining with the global shape of the cmb angular power spectrum . in particular , enhancements at low multipoles",
    "do not exist in the minimal @xmath32cdm models .    in the tracker - type models ,",
    "the cmb angular power spectrum may be also affected by the isocurvature mode @xcite .",
    "contrary to the cosine - type case , however , tracker field starts to evolve in the early universe and hence its effective mass is as large as the expansion rate of the universe . as a result ,",
    "fluctuation in the tracker field damps while the tracker field follows the attractor solution .",
    "in addition , in the tracker case , the flatness of the tracker potential is not guaranteed by any symmetry during the inflation .",
    "( notice that for the cosine - type case some symmetry may keep the flatness of the potential . ) as a result , in the de sitter background , the tracker field may acquire effective mass as large as @xmath86 during the inflation .",
    "this is the case for , for example , quintessence models based on supergravity with minimal khler potential .",
    "if such a large mass exists , fluctuation generated during the inflation is damped , as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ q(k ) ] ) .",
    "these effects may drastically suppress the signal of the isocurvature mode .",
    "detailed analysis of the tracker models will be given in elsewhere @xcite .",
    "since very accurate measurements of the cmb anisotropy are expected in the near future , in particular by the map @xcite and planck @xcite experiments , we will have more stringent constraints on the quintessence models as well as on the @xmath32cdm models .",
    "importantly , the quintessence and @xmath32cdm models may have different predictions on the shape of the cmb angular power spectrum , and some of the models may be confirmed or excluded once better observations of the cmb anisotropy become available . in particular , in the cosine - type quintessence models ,",
    "we have seen that the isocurvature perturbation may enhance the cmb angular power spectrum at low multipoles ( in particular , @xmath207 ) , which may be an interesting signal of the cosine - type quintessence models .",
