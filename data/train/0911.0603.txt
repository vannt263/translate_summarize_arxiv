    "steam reforming is an important industrial process , where natural gas ( ch@xmath7 ) is converted into synthesis gas ( co and h@xmath2 ) according to the overall reaction @xmath8 the synthesis gas is subsequently transformed into more valuable chemicals , such as ammonia , methanol , and diesel . since steam reforming acts as a source of hydrogen , it is also potentially important for any emerging hydrogen economy . for a detailed review of the steam reforming process and its applications the reader can consult ref .  .",
    "commercially the steam reforming reaction is conducted over a ni - based catalyst due to the relatively low cost and good activity of nickel .",
    "this reaction has been studied in detail on the close - packed ni(@xmath4 ) surface and on the stepped ni@xmath9 ) surface by means of density - functional theory.@xcite the major technological challenge for ni catalysts is the formation of carbonaceous deposits , termed coke , that lead to catalyst deactivation . in refs .",
    "it was established that the step edges on ni surfaces act as growth centers for graphite .",
    "other transition metals ( tm ) , such as ru , rh , pd , ir , and pt also show high activity and selectivity towards steam reforming@xcite and have a high resistance against carbon formation .",
    "however , these materials are scarce in nature and expensive",
    ". therefore new materials that are resistant to carbon formation are needed .",
    "transition - metal carbides ( tmc s ) have gained quite some attention since levy and boudart reported that they have \" platinum - like behavior  for certain reactions.@xcite the starting material for the production of carbides is cheap and abundant and therefore it has been suggested that they can replace the noble metals in catalysis .",
    "the main problem with the carbides has been to produce materials with sufficiently high surface area for them to be interesting for catalytic applications .",
    "this problem has been overcome and several studies report on carbides with surface areas as high as 200  m@xmath10g.@xcite    in refs .   and , it was shown that carbides of molybdenum and tungsten are stable and extremely active catalysts for not only the steam reforming but also the dry reforming and the partial oxidation of methane at elevated pressure . moreover ,",
    "no macroscopic carbon was deposition on the catalysts during the catalytic reactions .",
    "the relative activity of a number of steam reforming catalysts was established as : ru @xmath11 rh @xmath11 ir @xmath12 mo@xmath2c @xmath11 wc@xmath11 pd @xmath11 pt .",
    "several density - functional theory studies concerning adsorption on tmc s have been conducted , for example , atomic adsorption,@xcite o@xmath2 adsorption,@xcite co adsorption,@xcite nh@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) adsorption,@xcite methanol adsorption,@xcite ch@xmath13 ( @xmath15 ) and c@xmath2h@xmath7 adsorption.@xcite in addition , the water - gas - shift reaction has been studied in refs .  .    to our knowledge , a theoretical understanding of the steam reforming reaction on tmc s is missing in the literature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate how the tmc s are suited for the steam reforming reaction by performing a set of density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations on different surfaces of @xmath1-mo@xmath2c , tic , vc , and @xmath6-moc in order to catch the trends between tmc s composed of different tm atoms and of different structures .",
    "the influence of the surfaces being covered with oxygen is also investigated .",

    "the mo  c system can occur in several crystalline forms , see for example the phase diagrams in refs .   and",
    ". there are two types of mo@xmath2c phases , one orthorhombic ( @xmath1 ) and one hexagonal ( @xmath16 ) , which is a high temperature phase . in this study",
    ", we focus on the @xmath1 phase . for this phase",
    "the mo atoms are only slightly distorted from an hcp arrangement and the carbon atoms occupy one half of the octahedral interstitial sites . in the present molybdenum carbide literature",
    "there seems to be a confusion when it comes to the attribution of the symbols to the different phases , especially regarding the @xmath1 and @xmath16 phases .",
    "this is probably because the @xmath1-mo@xmath2c phase was originally assigned a hexagonal structure but refined experiments identified the structure to be of orthorhombic type@xcite , with lattice parameters @xmath17   , @xmath18    and @xmath19  .@xcite    the close - packed surface of @xmath1-mo@xmath2c is the ( @xmath5 ) surface .",
    "it consists of alternating mo and c layers and can be either mo- or c - terminated .",
    "experimental studies of @xmath1-mo@xmath2c(@xmath5 ) show that the surface termination and structure depend strongly on the cleaning procedure .",
    "both the mo- and the c - terminated surfaces have been observed .",
    "@xcite therefore we consider both the tm- and the c - terminated carbide surfaces .    the tic , vc and @xmath6-moc",

    "the ( @xmath5 ) surface of these carbides consists of layers of equal amounts of tm and c atoms .",

    "one important difference is that the c - terminated @xmath1-mo@xmath2c(@xmath5 ) surface has half the amount of c atoms as compared to a c - terminated tmc(@xmath4 ) surface .    in this paper , we report the results from dft calculations on ( i ) the tm- and c - terminated surfaces of @xmath1-mo@xmath2c(@xmath5 ) , tic(@xmath4 ) , vc(@xmath4 ) , and @xmath6-moc(@xmath4 ) ; ( ii ) the o - covered surfaces in ( i ) ; and ( iii ) the ( @xmath5 ) surfaces of tic , vc and @xmath6-moc .",

    "the bulk structure of @xmath1-mo@xmath2c was obtained by minimizing the total energy of the unit cell with respect to the length of the lattice vectors using a newton - raphson scheme and allowing for complete internal relaxation at each step .",

    "these relaxed surfaces and the corresponding vc and tic surfaces are used as starting points for the modeling of the steam reforming reaction .",
    "the investigated steam reforming reaction is assumed to have the following nine elementary steps : @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( 2@xmath34 ) denotes one ( two ) empty surface site and @xmath35 denotes the adsorbate @xmath36 bonded to this site .",

    "first of all we notice that the span of the potential energies of the investigated surfaces is huge . compared to the ni surfaces  @xcite ,",
    "all the tmc surfaces are much more reactive because they bind the intermediates too strongly .",

    "we present the trends in reactivity that are found when changing the tm atom in the tmc compound . for each of the considered tmc s",
    ", the c - terminated surface is found to be more reactive than the tm - terminated one .",
    "this is to be expected since the tmc(@xmath4 ) surfaces are found to be tm terminated under uhv conditions.@xcite all the tm - terminated tmc(@xmath4 ) surfaces have similar potential energy shape as a function of the reaction intermediates .",
    "the same is found for the c - terminated group of tmc surfaces . for the tm - terminated tmc surfaces , the reactivity can be ordered as tic(@xmath4 ) @xmath11 vc(@xmath4 ) @xmath11 @xmath1-mo@xmath2c(@xmath5 ) @xmath11 @xmath6-moc(@xmath4 ) , while for the c - terminated tmc surfaces we find that the reactivity order is tic(@xmath4 ) @xmath11 vc(@xmath4 ) @xmath11 @xmath6-moc(@xmath4 ) @xmath11 @xmath1-mo@xmath2c(@xmath5 ) .",

    "the largest minimum in the potential energy surface is found upon adsorption of o - carrying intermediates , that is , a strong o  surface bond is formed .",
