    "another case widely studied is the scenario with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we can obtain this state from the case studied in the previous section , antisymmetrizing the first and the last free spin 1/2 variables .",
    "this state is unique , as follows given that the coordination number for each spin is two @xcite .    in this state",

    "the tensors @xmath169 and @xmath170 are respectively given by    @xmath171    as with the case studied in section [ 1/2boundary ] , it is easy to see that if we write the partial density matrix in the form @xmath172 the partial transposed density matrix @xmath173 is isomorphic ( up to change of basis ) to @xmath174 .",
    "we can use again the convexity of the space of density matrices to prove that the matrix @xmath174 is also a density matrix , for @xmath175 from this result we see that negativity vanish for @xmath176 .",
    "understanding the entanglement structure of aklt states is important because aklt states have recently been recognized as useful resources for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "we have computed the entanglement between non - complementary blocks of spins in such a system .",
    "we have found that the aklt chain allows an analytic computation of the negativity between non - complementary blocks in a short range ( realistic ) spin model , which has not been accomplished in the other models studied to date .",
    "the entanglement properties of a system of two blocks made up from the ground state of an aklt system depends dramatically on whether the blocks touch each other .",
    "we have proved that the negativity of a system of two blocks separated by @xmath177 sites obtained from a unique ground state ( [ vbs_state ] ) , is strictly zero .    in the case when all the sites contain a spin 1 and open boundary conditions , the entanglement properties , and particularly the negativity , depends on the configuration between the sites at the boundary .",
    "each of the spin 1 variables can be constructed from the symmetrization of two spin 1/2 states . in particular , the sites at the boundary can be constructed through this process . in this boundary sites , however , one of those spin 1/2 can be in any state , i.e. @xmath178 or @xmath179",
    ". we can construct bell states between the first and the last spins 1/2 in the chain .",
    "this states have non vanishing negativity regardless the separation between the subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 inside the chain .",
    "if , on the other hand , the spins 1/2 at the end of the chain are in one of the four separable states ( i.e. calling the first and the last site @xmath17 and @xmath3 respectively , @xmath180 , @xmath181,@xmath182,@xmath183 ) then the negativity vanish when the subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 are separated .",
    "thus , in practice , as there is no easy way to isolate one of those aklt ground states which have a bell state between its end spins , we would expect vanishing negativity even for the case when all sites contain a spin 1 .",
    "we have also shown that the vanishing negativity between separated blocks of spins also holds for the periodic aklt which has a unique ground state .",
    "other important results of our work include a general expression for the reduced density matrix of an arbitrary pair of blocks of spins in a aklt chain that includes the case of separated blocks , and the negativities between those non - complementary blocks that touch each other at a point .",

    "<S> the existence of nonzero negativity is signal of entanglement , but , as pointed out in @xcite , vanishing negativity does not imply zero entanglement .    in this paper , we present the result for the negativity of two blocks defined as subsystems of the aklt ground state . in quantum information , </S>",
    "<S> entanglement between separated systems is a valuable resource . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> it is important to calculate the entanglement between separated ( i.e. non - complementary ) blocks of a system . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to examine whether such an entanglement resource is present in the aklt model whose ground state has already been demonstrated to be an ideal resource for measurement based quantum wires @xcite in 1d , and quantum computation @xcite in 2d . it is a realistic model of spin systems in the sense of being short range and models the gapped nature of integer spin models . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps its most attractive feature is its analytic solvability and thereby it holds the promise of the first ever analytic computation of negativity for a short range model . </S>"
