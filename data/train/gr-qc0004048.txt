    "the neutrino oscillations have been a hot topic in the high energy experimental and theoretical phycics recently  @xcite , in particular , with highly confident atomspheric neutrino experiment of super - kamiokande to assure the neutrino mass  @xcite . as a natural extension of the theoretical consideration",
    ", the description of neutrino oscillation in the flat spacetime should be replaced by that in the curved spacetime if the gravitational background is taken into account . in other words , the physics related to the neutrino oscillation in minkowski spacetime with lorentz invariant will be extended to riemanian spacetime with general coordinate transformation .",
    "the pioneer theoretical considerations on the gravitationally induced neutrino oscillation were proposed by wudka  @xcite , and later advocated by ahluwalia  @xcite who for the first time presented the three flavor neutrino oscillations in the weak field expansion scheme .",
    "further some thoughtful idea on the nongeometrical element in the description of the gravitational theory , trigered by the gravitationally induced neutrino oscillation clock , was also provided  @xcite . moreover",
    "the violation of the equivalence principle was also employed to account for the significant influence on the msw effect  @xcite for the solar neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "more recently , from the different angle , the gravitational effects on the neutrino oscillations have been paid much attention by a number of authors  @xcite , but , unfortunately , debates and conflicts occur in the understanding of the gravitationally induced neutrino oscillations  @xcite .    in this paper , we will discuss the particle interference phase in a gravitational field in a unified version , i.e. , provide a unified description of the phases for both high energy particle ( two mass neutrinos ) and low energy particle ( cow thermal neutrons ) . in order to develope the treatments by using the null condition to calculate the neutrino relative phase and appling the weak field condition to calculate cow thermal neutron phase , we employ the accurate particle world line ( geodesic ) to calculate both phase factors , and at last we can obtain the correct neutrino relative phase by dividing a factor of 2 and obtain the cow neutron interference phase by the convenient approximated condition .",
    "the energy condition in the gravitational field to account for the relative phase of mass neutrinos often makes the confusions and even conflictsahl96,ful96,bha99 .",
    "apparently , we point out that almost all debates related to the neutrino oscillation in curved spacetime originate from the inconvenient use of this condition . it is noted that replacing the null by the geodesic to calculate the neutrino oscillation phase will produce a factor of 2 error .",
    "however this factor of 2 will be automatically deleted when considering the two neutrino arrival time differncebha99 . here",
    ", we still follow the plane wave treatment for the extremely relativistic neutrinos in the framework of the standard treatment  @xcite , otherwise the wave packet treatment will be applied for the general case  @xcite .",
    "for the reason of simplicity , we confine our treatment in two generation neutrinos ( electron and muon ) and mainly in schwarzschild geometry with radial propagation and nonradial propagation respectively .",
    "the purpose of the paper is threefold .",
    "first we point out the general treatment of the high ( low ) energy particle phase in a gravitational field , include the type - i and type - ii phases .",
    "second we give the complete description of neutrino phase along the geodesic , and point out the relation to that by the null in the high energy limit .",
    "third we apply the covariant geodesic phase to the cow thermal interference phase , then we can find that the geodesic phase can result in the correct results for the interference phases of both the two mass neutrinos and the thermal neutron by the standard treatment .",
    "so the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss dirac equation and the treatments of particle interference phase in the curved spacetime , which includes type - i and type - ii phases . in sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the neutrino oscillation phase in schwarzschild spacetime along the geodesic , and compare it with that along the null , in the radial and nonradial directions respectively .",
    "the application of the unified geodesic phase to the cow thermal neutron interference is done in sec .",
    "v. furthermore , discussions and conclusions involved in the high energy neutrino oscillations and low energy thermal neutron interference in curved spacetime are given .",
    "we set @xmath0 throughout this article .",
    "previous to entering our main point , we stress that the semiclassical approximated dirac particle does not follow the geodesic exactly , but the force aroused by the spin and the curvature coupling has a little contribution to the geodesic deviation  @xcite .",
    "so here we take the neutrino as a spinless particle to go along the geodesic  @xcite .",

    "the above phase calculation is a precisely treatment , and we do not use any approxamations , except the final approximated simplification .",
    "however , we admit that the schwarzschild coordinates employed to calculate the phase factor is not the real physical distance although there exists some complications between them in the general case .    in order to illustrate the validity of the geodesic phase treatment ,",
    "we calculate the geodesic phase again from the other method . from the equations ( [ mseq1 ] ) and ( [ dsdr2 ] ) , the derivative between the time - like and the space - like coordinates ,    [ dtdr ] dt dr & = & [ 1 - ( m p_o)^2 g_oo]^-1/2 + & & ( 1 + ^2 ) , if the neutrino mass @xmath48 , then @xmath62 , which leads to the null condition @xmath63 that is conventionally used in the standard treatmentful96,for96 . for the electron neutrino , the mass @xmath64 ev and the energy @xmath65 mev , @xmath66boe92,bah94 , which is really a little quantity .",

    "it is not strange that the geodesic phase is double of the result by the null  @xcite .",
    "this also indicates that the application of the null condition arises the correct result , and the geodesic phase of two neutrinos despises the two neutrino arrival time differencebha99 .",
    "now we discuss the physical coordinate problem because the schwarzschild coordinate employed in eq.([rpap ] ) is not the proper physical distance , however , which is given by    l - l_o & & _ r_o^r dr + & = & r - r_o + & + & .",
    "we consider the case of a weak field , then the physical distance is approximately obtained l - l_o r - r_o + 2 , [ apd ] where l(@xmath68 ) is the proper physical distance corresponding to the coordinate r ( @xmath69 ) . in the case of weak field as well as",
    "the conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we obtain    r = ( 1 - 2l ) l = l , [ rl ] where @xmath72 is the gravitational potential expressed by the physical distance .",
    "so the relative phase of the mass neutrinos is    = m^22p_ol , [ dpw ] where @xmath73 is the mass square difference .",
    "so the oscillation length can be given by the usual manner    l_osc = 2 .",
    "likewise , as stated by cardall and fuller  @xcite , @xmath45 does _ not _ represent the neutrino energy measured by a locally inertial observer at rest at finite radius , but rather the energy of the neutrino measured by such an observer at rest at infinity .",
    "it is generally not possible to extract a separate `` gravitational phase '' from the expression ( [ dpw ] ) ; nevertheless , it is clear that gravity has an effect on the oscillations of the radially propagating neutrinos , corresponding to the gravitational redshift . in the weak field limit",
    "one could define a `` gravitational phase , '' however , the energy definition and coordinate condition should be apparently declared .",
    "in this section we contrast the radially propagating neutrinos with the nonradically propagating neutrinos in order to demonstrate how the gravity affects vacuum neutrino oscillations . as a further application",
    ", the general covariant phase can be applied to solve the nonrelativistic thermal neutron interference . for the general nonradial propagation of the mass particle ,",

    "type - ii phase is proportional to the square of the effect of gravitational red shift .",
    "namely , type - i phase is the first order effect of the gravitational potential and type - ii phase is the second order effect of the gravitational potential .",
    "so we can neglect the type - ii phase when dealing with the physical problems in the solar system , such as atomspheric neutrino , solar neutrino as well as the thermal neutron interference in cow experiment .",

    ", we can speculate that the type - ii phase should play an important role in the strong rotational gravitational field , especially near kerr black hole , where the high order terms of gravitational potential will effect .",
    "the velocity of an extremely relativistic neutrino is nearly the speed of light . despite of this",
    ", the propagation difference between a massive neutrino and a photon can have important consequences . in the standard treatment of the neutrino oscillation ,",
    "the neutrino is usually supposed to travel along null - lines  @xcite , and almost no attention has been paid to this small difference .",
    "although seemingly irrelevant , this tiny deviation becomes important for the understanding of the neutrino oscillation .",
    "motivated by this argument , we will compare the neutrino phase when calculated along the geodesic and along the null - line . with this",
    ", we will be able to verify the factor of 2 error when the null is replaced by the geodesic .",
    "this study can be shown to remain valid in the case of flat spacetime .",
    "let @xmath97 and @xmath98 be the tangent vectors to the geodesic and to the null - line , respectively , their difference @xmath99 being a small quantity for the case of an extremely relativistic neutrino . here",
    ", we suppose that the two neutrinos , the massless and massive , start their journey at the same initial spacetime position a , and their _ space _ routes are almost the same .",
    "but , there will be an arrival time - difference at the detector position b. this means that their 4-dimensional spacetime trajectories are not the same , and consequently the tangent vectors will present a small difference .",
    "thus , we have [ nne ] n^ = ^ + ^ , p^ = ^ + m^ , where @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) is the 4-momentum along the geodesic ( null - line ) with ^ = dx^d = d^ds and n^ = dx^ds . in these expressions , @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    "are respectively affine parameters along the null and the geodesic lines .",
    "these two tangent vectors satisfy the mass shell relations of the geodesic and the null - line : [ gn ] g _ n^n^ = 1 and [ nn ] g _ ^^ = 0 .",
    "now , substituting ( [ nne ] ) into ( [ gn ] ) , we obtain [ msg2 ] g _",
    "( ^ + ^ ) ( ^ + ^ ) = 1 , or , by using ( [ nn ] ) , [ nne2 ] 2 g _ ^ ^ + o(^2 ) = 1 .",
    "we can estimate the order of @xmath104 and @xmath105 by noting that @xmath106 , which implies that @xmath107 , where @xmath108 @xmath109 for a relativistic neutrino .",
    "the neutrino phase induced by the null condition , as in the standard treatment , comes from the 4-momentum @xmath110 defined along the geodesic line , and the tangent vector @xmath111 to the null - line  @xcite .",
    "we notice that , if the 4-momentum @xmath112 defined along the null - line was instead used to compute the null phase , we would obtain zero because of the null condition .",
    "therefore , the phase along the geodesic line ( geodesic phase ) and the phase along the null - line ( null phase ) can be written respectively as  @xcite [ nrpb ] ( geod)= m ds = g_p^n^ds , and ( null ) = g_p^^ds .",
    "therefore , the difference between the geodesic phase and the null phase , by using eq.([nne2 ] ) , is ( geod ) & - & ( null)= g_p^(n^ - ^ ) ds + & = & g_p^ ^ ds = g_^^ ds + o(^2 ) + & = & 12 m ds + o(^2 ) = 12(geod ) + o(^2 ) , that is ( geod ) = 2 ( null ) + o(^2 ) .",
    "this conclusion , valid for a general curved spacetime , is similar to that found in in a schwarzschild  @xcite spacetime . concerning the schwarzschild spacetime , bhattacharya _ et al _  @xcite have the following argument for the factor of 2 . as the neutrino energy is fixed , but the masses are different , if a interference is to be observed at the same final spacetime point b@xmath113 , the relevant components of the wave function could not both have started at the same initial spacetime point a@xmath114 in the semiclassical approximation",
    "instead , the lighter mass ( hence faster moving ) component must either have started at the same time from a spatial location @xmath115 , or ( what is equivalent ) started from the same location @xmath116 at a later time @xmath117 .",
    "hence , there is already an initial phase difference between the two mass components due to this time gap , even before the transport from @xmath116 to @xmath118 which leads to the phase @xmath119 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the additional initial phase difference may be taken into account  @xcite .",
