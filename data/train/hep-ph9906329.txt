    "the continuing experimental success of the standard model ( sm ) suggests the possibility that additional particles and/or non - standard interactions may only be found at scales much larger than @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "several questions remain unanswered within the sm framework that may require new dynamics in order to be addressed .",
    "chief among these questions are the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and of fermion masses . in principle",
    ", it could be argued that the energy scales of the new dynamics related to these questions may be so large as to be irrelevant to observables at the electroweak scale .",
    "however , it is known that the physics behind the higgs sector , responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry , can not reside at scales much higher than few tev .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that the origin of the top quark mass might be related to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , at least in some cases , the dynamics associated with new physics may not reside at arbitrarily high energies and there might be some observable effects at lower energies .    the effects of integrating out the physics residing at some high energy scale @xmath7 , can be organized in an effective field theory for the remaining degrees of freedom . such a theory for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector of the sm involves the electroweak gauge bosons as well as the nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) associated with the spontaneous breaking of @xmath8 down to @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the effective theory must be studied up to next - to - leading order for the possible departures from the sm to appear .",
    "this program resembles that of chiral perturbation theory for pions in low energy qcd where , for instance , the presence of the @xmath10 resonance results in deviations from the low energy theorems . for the case of the electroweak interactions ,",
    "a variety of electroweak precision measurements and flavor changing neutral current processes provide testing ground for possible deviations originating in the ewsb sector of the sm .",
    "the next - to - leading order terms in the effective theory will generally contribute to oblique corrections , triple and quartic anomalous gauge boson couplings , and corrections to the ngb propagators that result in four - fermion interactions  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the low energy description of the interactions of the ewsb sector ( i.e. gauge bosons plus ngbs ) one may consider the possibility that the new physics above @xmath11 may also modify the effective interactions of the sm fermions to the electroweak gauge bosons . in principle",
    ", this also has a parallel in low energy qcd , as it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where symmetry alone is not enough to determine the axial coupling of nucleons to pions .",
    "in fact , the departure of this coupling from unity is a non - universal effect , only determined by the full theory of qcd .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is suggested that in addition to the effects in the ewsb sector of the theory , it is possible that the interactions of fermions with the ngbs are affected by the new dynamics above @xmath11 , resulting in anomalous interactions with the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "this is particularly interesting if fermion masses are dynamically generated , as is the case with the nucleon mass .",
    "interestingly , the proximity of the top quark mass to the electroweak scale @xmath12gev , hints the possibility the top mass might be a dynamically generated `` constituent '' mass .",
    "thus , it is of particular interest to study the couplings of third generation quarks to electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "processes involving fcnc transitions in @xmath0 and @xmath13 decays are a crucial complement to precision electroweak observables , when constraining the physics of the ewsb sector .",

    "on the other hand , the anomalous couplings of third generation quarks to the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 can come from dimension - four and dimension - five operators .",
    "the indirect effects of the dimension - four operators have been considered in relation to electroweak observables in ref .",

    "for completeness , we also present the analysis of the dimension - four operators .",
    "we discuss that with the very natural assumption of chiral symmetry , in fact enforcing vanishing fermion mass renormalization in the chiral limit , the effects of dimension - four operators found in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1 are not so dramatic .",
    "moreover , we will see that the effects of dimension - five operators are comparable and may even dominate over the supposedly leading lower dimension contributions .    in section  2 we present a brief introduction to the effective theory approach and set our notation .",

    "finally , we discuss the results and conclude in section  5 .",
    "if the higgs boson , responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , is very heavy , it can be effectively removed from the physical low  energy spectrum . in this case and for dynamical symmetry breaking scenarios relying on new strong interactions ,",
    "one is led to consider the most general effective lagrangian which employs a nonlinear representation of the spontaneously broken @xmath17 gauge symmetry @xcite .",

    "the effects of new dynamics on the couplings of fermions with the sm gauge bosons can be , in principle , also studied in an effective lagrangian approach .",

    "( [ c12 g ] ) , ( [ c11z ] ) and ( [ c11box ] ) suggests the possibility of an enhancement , this is not enough .",
    "this is obviously true for the coefficients @xmath161 and @xmath162 , which as we argue above should be proportional to @xmath166 .",
    "but even when considering @xmath173 , the effect is suppressed by an effective scale given by @xmath174gev , which should be compared with the typical momentum transfers in @xmath0 decays .",
    "the remaining group of coefficients we dubbed left - handed includes @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 plus @xmath180 which actually is the coefficient of a vector operator , but since is not chirally suppressed is included with the lh in this part of the analysis .",
    "these operators affect mainly the @xmath16 rates .",
    "thus it is possible to imagine that the underlying new physics preserves chiral symmetry at the same time that does not generate a large value of @xmath163 , resulting in no deviations in @xmath1 ; but that the effects of the new interactions give rise to large effects in the dilepton modes .",
    "although these have not been observed yet the experimental sensitivity is very close to the sm predictions and it will reach them in the near future .",
    "the leading effects in @xmath16 come from the coefficients @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath180 . for simplicity",

    "[ lh ] it is apparent that cancellations occur when the three coefficients are similar .",
    "the effect of considering only @xmath177 shows than even larger effects are possible . in any case ,",
    "sizeable deviations in @xmath16 are possible even in the absence of effects in @xmath1 .",
    "processes involving fcnc transitions in @xmath0 and @xmath13 decays are a crucial complement to precision electroweak observables , when constraining the physics of the ewsb sector . in this paper",
    ", we have considered the effects of anomalous couplings of third generation quarks to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 gauge bosons .",
    "we computed the effects of all possible dimension - five operators in @xmath0 fcnc transitions such as @xmath1 and @xmath16 . for completeness",
    ", we have also also presented the analysis of the dimension - four operators .",
    "we have shown that with the natural assumption of chiral symmetry , in fact enforcing vanishing fermion mass renormalization in the chiral limit , the effects of the dimension - four operators with coefficient @xmath116 for @xmath183 , are not as dramatic as found ref .",
    "@xcite , and somehow smaller than those of @xmath124 , which can produce important deviations in the branching ratio that could be resolved in the next round of experiments at @xmath0 factories .",
    "on the other hand , we have found that the dimension - five operator with coefficient @xmath185 , for which no additional chiral suppression is expected , can give rise to an observable deviation of the @xmath1 branching ratio from its sm expectation even for rather small values of @xmath163 .",
    "left handed operators , on the other hand , affect mainly the @xmath151 rates and we have illustrated that in several scenarios sizeable deviations in @xmath16 are possible even in the absence of effects in @xmath1 .",
    "the dimension - five operators , just as in the case of the more studied dimension - four operators , can be generated at high energies scales by the presence of new particles and/or interactions .",
    "for instance , as a simple example , a heavy scalar sector with both charged and neutral states , would give contributions to many of the coefficients of the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lags ] ) .",
    "richer dynamics at the tev scale might generate also some of the vector and/or tensor couplings of eq .",
    "( [ lagv ] ) and  ( [ lagt ] ) .",
    "the @xmath186 @xmath0 factories at cornell , kek and slac are expected to reach better measurements of the @xmath1 branching ratio , which will largely constrain the dimension - five coefficient @xmath163 and to a lesser extent the dimension - four coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , these experiments as well as those at the fermilab tevatron , will reach the sm sensitivity for the @xmath16 branching fraction .",
    "the present analysis , together with previous ones addressing the effects of other anomalous higher dimensional operators in these decay modes , will enable us to interpret a possible pattern of deviations from the sm and perhaps point to its dynamical origin .",
