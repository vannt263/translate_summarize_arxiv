    "diffractive @xmath0 interactions are characterized by a leading ( high longitudinal momentum ) outgoing proton or antiproton and/or a large _ rapidity gap _ , defined as a region of pseudorapidity , @xmath2 , devoid of particles .",
    "the large rapidity gap is presumed to be due to the exchange of a pomeron , which carries the internal quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "rapidity gaps formed by multiplicity fluctuations in non - diffractive ( nd ) events are exponentially suppressed with increasing @xmath3 , so that gaps of @xmath4 are mainly diffractive . at high energies , where the available rapidity space is large , diffractive events may have more than one diffractive gap .",
    "the ratio of two - gap to one - gap events is unaffected by the presence of color exchanges in the same event that tend to `` fill in '' diffractive gaps and suppress the gap formation cross section ( gap survival probability  @xcite ) , since the presence of one gap is sufficient to guarantee that no color exchange occurred .",
    "thus , two - gap to one - gap ratios can be used to test qcd based models of diffraction without having to simultaneously address the problem of gap survival .",
    "diffractive events that incorporate a hard scattering are referred to as _ hard diffraction_. in this paper , we first present a brief review of hard diffraction results obtained by cdf at the tevatron and place them in perspective relative to results obtained at hera and relative to theoretical expectations .",
    "then , we review the recent double - gap results reported by cdf , and finally conclude with remarks pertaining to both soft and hard diffraction .",
    "the cdf results on hard diffraction fall into two classes , characterized by the signature used to identify and extract the diffractive signal : a large rapidity gap or a leading antiproton .      using the rapidity gap signature to identify diffractive events ,",
    "cdf measured the single - diffractive ( sd ) fractions of @xmath5  @xcite , dijet  @xcite , @xmath6-quark  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite production in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath8 gev and the fraction of dijet events with a rapidity gap between jets ( double - diffraction , dd ) at @xmath8  @xcite and 630  @xcite gev .",
    "the results for the measured fractions are shown in table  [ table_frac ] .",
    ".diffractive fractions [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_ratios ]    -0.2 cm -3.2 cm",
    "-0.2 cm -3.2 cm    the ratio of dpe to inclusive sd events was evaluated for @xmath9 .",
    "the results for @xmath101800 and 630 gev are presented in table  [ table_ratios ] and shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : idpe]b . also presented in the table are the expectations from gap probability renormalization  @xcite , regge theory and factorization , and pomeron flux renormalization for both exchanged pomerons  @xcite .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are largely systematic for both data and theory ; the theoretical uncertainties of 10% are due to the uncertainty in the ratio of the triple - pomeron to the pomeron - nucleon couplings  @xcite .",
    "the data are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the gap renormalization approach .",
    "the experimental data on soft and hard diffraction obtained at the tevatron by the cdf and d collaborations show the following remarkable characteristics :    * all diffractive differential cross sections can be factorized into two terms : + ( a ) a term representing the rapidity gap dependence or _ gap probability distribution _ , and + ( b ) a second term consisting of the @xmath0 total cross section at the sub - energy of the diffractive cluster(s ) .",
    "the diffractive sub - energy @xmath11 is defined through the equation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a diffractive mass and all energies are in gev . for sd , i=1 and @xmath14",
    "is the @xmath15-@xmath16 collision energy ; for double diffraction , i=2 and @xmath17 are the dissociation masses of the @xmath16 and @xmath18 ; and for dpe , i=1 and @xmath14 is the @xmath15-@xmath15 collision energy . in all cases",
    ", @xmath19 is the rapidity width occupied by the diffraction dissociation products .",
    "the rapidity gap width is @xmath20 .",
    "this term of the cross section , ( b ) , is multiplied by a factor @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the ratio of the triple-@xmath15 to the @xmath23 coupling and @xmath24 is the number of gaps per event in the process under study ; @xmath22 is interpreted as a color factor for gap formation  @xcite . *",
    "the differential shape of all cross sections is correctly predicted by regge theory , apart from an overall normalization , which is suppressed at high energies .",
    "differential shapes are also predicted correctly by a parton model approach to diffraction  @xcite . *",
    "the term representing the rapidity gap dependence does not depend explicitly on @xmath25 .",
    "this feature represents a scaling law for diffraction and forms the basis of the renormalization model proposed to account for the suppression of the regge cross sections at high energies  @xcite . * two - gap to one - gap ratios",
    "are not suppressed , and thus can be used for testing qcd - based diffractive models without the complications arising from gap survival effects .",
