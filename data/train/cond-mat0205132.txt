    "the theory of quasi - static fractures in brittle media @xcite calls for solving different equations depending on the mode of fracture . in this paper",
    "we present an approach based on iterated conformal maps which can be adapted to solve all three modes of fracture ( known as mode i , ii and iii ) , including the effects of inhomogeneities and randomness of the brittle material itself .",
    "basically , the theory of fracture in brittle continuous media is based on the equation of motion for an isotropic elastic body in the continuum limit @xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the field describing the displacement of each mass point from its location in an unstrained body and @xmath2 is the density .",
    "the constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the lam constants . in terms of the displacement field",
    "the elastic strain tensor is defined as @xmath5 for the development of a crack the important object is the stress tensor , which in linear elasticity is written as @xmath6 when the stress component which is transverse to the interface of a crack exceeds a threshold value @xmath7 , the crack can develop .",
    "when the external load is such that the transverse stress exceeds only slightly the threshold value , the crack develops slowly , and one can neglect the second time - derivative in eq .",
    "( [ eqmot ] ) .",
    "this is the quasi - static limit , in which after each growth event one needs to recalculate the strain field by solving the lam equation @xmath8 the three  pure \" modes of fracture that can be considered are determined by the boundary conditions , or load , at infinity .",
    "these are @xmath9 we will study the fracture patterns of these two modes in 2-dimensional materials .",
    "mode iii calls for a third dimension @xmath10 , since @xmath11 such an applied stress creates a displacement field @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 in the medium .",
    "thus , in spite of the third dimension , the calculation of the strain and stress tensors remain two dimensional . nevertheless , the equations to be solved in mode iii and modes i and ii are different . in mode iii fracture",
    "@xmath15 , and the lam equation reduces to laplace s equation @xmath16 and therefore @xmath17 is the real part , re @xmath18 , of an analytic function @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 . the boundary conditions far from the crack and on the crack interface can be used to find this analytic function . on the other hand , for mode",
    "i and mode ii fractures in plane elasticity one introduces @xcite the airy potential @xmath21 such that @xmath22 the airy potential @xmath23 solves the bi - laplacian equation @xcite @xmath24 the solution of the bi - laplacian equation can be written in terms of _ two _ analytic functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27 \\ . \\label{uphichi}\\ ] ] this difference requires therefore a separate discussion of mode iii and modes i and ii .",
    "the problem of quasi - static crack propagation is difficult not only because it is hard to solve eq .",
    "( [ lame ] ) for an arbitrarily shaped crack .",
    "another source of difficulty is that the equation does not dictate how to propagate a crack when the stress tensor exceeds the threshold value @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we consider only 2-dimensional , or effectively 2-dimensional ( i.e thin slabs ) brittle materials in @xmath28 . we can then describe a crack of arbitrary shape by its interface @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the arc length which is used to parameterize the contour .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath31 to describe respectively the transverse and normal directions at any point on the two - dimensional crack interface .",
    "the literature is quite in agreement that the velocity of propagation of the crack has a normal component which is some function of @xmath32 for mode i and ii , and of @xmath33 for mode iii . in both cases",
    "@xmath7 is a measure of the strength of the material , and fracture occurs only if the local stress tensor at the boundary of the crack exceeds this quantity ( which can also be a random function of position ) .",
    "there is hardly a consensus however on what that function is .",
    "the simplest choice @xcite is a linear function , @xmath34 when @xmath35 , and @xmath36 otherwise .",
    "other velocity laws are possible @xcite . in our study of mode",
    "iii fracture we will examine also a quadratic and an exponential velocity law : @xmath37 it is important to study these variants of the velocity law to ascertain the degree of universality of the geometric characteristics of the resulting cracks .",
    "one of our results is that these characteristics _ may depend _ on the velocity law .",
    "while this may be a disappointment from the point of view of fundamental physics , it may help to identify the correct physical mechanisms of fractures in different media .",
    "the lack of universality is even more obvious when we add quenched noise , or random values of @xmath38 .",
    "the geometric characteristics of the cracks may depend on the probability distribution of random values of @xmath38 . again",
    "this may give a handle on the characterization of inhomogeneous brittle materials .",
    "at any point in time there can be more than one position @xmath30 on the interface for which @xmath39 does not vanish .",
    "we choose the next growth position randomly with a probability proportional to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "there we extend the crack by a fixed area of the size of the  process zone \" ( and see below for details ) .",
    "this is similar to diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) in which a particle is grown with a probability proportional to the gradient of the field .",
    "one should note that another model could be derived in which all eligible fracture sites are grown simultaneously , growing a whole layer whose local width is @xmath39 .",
    "this would be more akin to laplacian growth algorithms , which in general give rise to clusters in a different universality class than dla @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ confsec ] we discuss the growth algorithm in terms of iterated conformal maps . in sect .",
    "[ modeiii ] this method is applied to mode iii quasi - static fracture .",
    "a preliminary report of the method for this case was presented in @xcite . in sect .",
    "iv we present new results including the consequences of the different velocity laws ( [ quad ] ) and ( [ exp ] ) , and those of quenched randomness .",
    "we discuss the geometric properties of the fracture patterns , including issues of roughening and exponents .",
    "we point out that the roughening exponents are not always well defined , since the fracture patterns do not have stationary geometric characteristics .",
    "there is an increased tendency for ramification as the fracture develops .",
    "this is reflected in an apparent increase in the roughening exponents of the backbone of the pattern . in sect .",
    "[ modei ] we discuss the theory of mode i and ii fracture .",
    "sect.[mode12results ] presents the results .",
    "we will see that the fracture patterns in mode i and ii are much less rough then in mode iii ( for the same velocity law ) , in agreement with the analysis of @xcite .",
    "we will conclude the paper in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the main conclusion is that mode iii results in cracks whose geometric characteristics are in a different class than modes i and ii .",
    "the former creates cracks that exhibit a cross over in the roughening exponent from about 0.5 to a higher scaling exponent on the larger scales .",
    "in contrast , modes i and ii create cracks that are not rough on the large scales . quenched randomness may affect the geometry of the cracks as is exemplified and discussed in this paper .",
    "the direct determination of the strain tensor for an arbitrary shaped ( and evolving ) crack is difficult .",
    "we therefore proceed by turning to a mathematical complex plane @xmath40 , in which the crack is forever circular and of unit radius .",
    "next invoke a conformal map @xmath41 that maps the exterior of the unit circle in the mathematical plane @xmath40 to the exterior of the crack in the physical plane @xmath10 , after @xmath42 growth steps . the conformal map will be univalent by construction , and we can write its laurent expansion in the form @xmath43 for all modes of fracture we take @xmath44 , and the iterative dynamics calls for the calculation of the transverse component of the stress tensor on the boundary of the crack . the arclength position @xmath30 in the physical domain",
    "is mapped by the inverse of @xmath45 onto a position the unit circle @xmath46 .",
    "we will be able to compute the stress tensor on the boundary of the crack in the physical domain by performing the calculation on the unit circle .",
    "in other words we will compute @xmath47 or @xmath48 on the unit circle in the mathematical plane .",
    "the actual calculation of this component of the stress tensor differs in modes i , ii and mode iii .",
    "we perform the calculation iteratively , taking the stress as known for the crack after @xmath49 fracture events .    in order to implement the @xmath42th cracking event according to one of the required velocity laws ( [ vel])-([exp ] )",
    ", we should choose potential positions on the interface more often when @xmath50 is larger .",
    "consider for example the linear velocity law ( [ vel ] ) .",
    "we construct a probability density @xmath51 on the unit circle @xmath52 which satisfies @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the heaviside function , and @xmath55 is simply the jacobian of the transformation from mathematical to physical plane .",
    "the next growth position , @xmath56 in the mathematical plane , is chosen randomly with respect to the probability @xmath57 . at the chosen position on the crack ,",
    "i.e. @xmath58 , we want to advance the crack with a region whose area is the typical process zone for the material that we analyze . according to @xcite",
    "the typical scale of the process zone is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a characteristic fracture toughness parameter . denoting the typical _ area _ of the process zone by @xmath61",
    ", we achieve growth with an auxiliary conformal map @xmath62 that maps the unit circle to a unit circle with a bump of area @xmath63 centered at @xmath64 .",
    "an example of such a map is given by @xcite : @xmath65 -1 \\right \\ } ^a \\nonumber\\\\     & & \\phi_{\\lambda,\\theta } ( w ) = e^{i \\theta } \\phi_{\\lambda,0}(e^{-i     \\theta }     w ) \\",

    "in this section we discuss how to compute the stress tensor when the load is mode iii , using the method of iterated conformal maps .",
    "the first step is the determination of the boundary conditions that the analytic function ( [ analytic ] ) needs to satisfy .",

    "we only need to make sure that it satisfies the boundary conditions .",
    "however , if we have a good solution in the mathematical plane , we need just to compose it with an analytic function that takes us from the physical to the mathematical plane . the required analytic function @xmath88 is given by the expression @xmath89\\big({\\phi^{(n)}}^{-1}(z ) - 1/{\\phi^{(n)}}^{-1}(z)\\big ) \\ .\\ ] ] ( if @xmath45 is conformal , @xmath90 is analytic by definition ) . from this",

    "[ fracture ] exhibits in the upper panel a typical fracture pattern that is obtained with this theory , with @xmath94 , after 10 000 growth events . the threshold value of @xmath7 for the occurrence of the first event ( cf .",

    "we always implement the first event .",
    "for the next growth event the threshold is @xmath96 .",
    "we thus display in fig.1 a cluster obtained with @xmath97 , to be close to the quasi - static limit .",

    "[ quenched ] . with fixed @xmath7",

    "the geometric characteristics of the fracture pattern are _ not _ invariant to the growth . for this reason it makes little sense to measure the fractal dimension of the pattern ; this is not a stable characteristic , and it will change with the growth . on the other hand , we should realize that the fracture pattern is not what is observed in typical experiments .",
    "when the fracture hits the boundaries of the sample , and the sample breaks into two parts , all the side - branches of the pattern remain hidden in the damaged material , and only the backbone of the fracture pattern appears as the surface of the broken parts . the backbone does not suffer from the geometric variability discussed above . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fracture ] we show the backbone of the pattern displayed in the upper panel .",
    "this backbone is representative of all the fracture patterns with the linear velocity law .",
    "we should note that in our theory there are no lateral boundaries , and the backbone shown does not suffer from finite size effects which may very well exist in experimental realizations .    in determining the roughness exponent of the backbone , we should note that a close examination of it reveals that _ it is not a graph_. there are overhangs in this backbone , and since we deal with mode iii fracturing , the two pieces of material _ can _ separate leaving these overhangs intact . accordingly , one should not approach the roughness exponent using correlation function techniques ; these may introduce serious errors when overhangs exist @xcite .",
    "rather , we should measure , for any given @xmath99 , the quantity @xcite @xmath100 the roughness exponent @xmath101 is then obtained from @xmath102 if this relation holds . to get good statistics we average , in addition to all @xmath103 for the same backbone , over many fracture patterns .",

    "the short length scale exponent of order 0.5 is also in agreement with recent simulational results of a lattice model @xcite ( which is by definition a short length scale solution ) .",
    "bouchaud @xcite proposed that the cross - over stems from transition between slow and rapid fracture , from the  vicinity of the depinning transition \" to the  moving phase \" in her terms .",
    "obviously , in our theory we solve the quasi - static equation all along , and there is no change of physics .",
    "in addition , there is no reason to expect the experiment to be a pure mode iii , and as we will see below modes i and ii do not show similar roughening",
    ". nevertheless , as we observed before , the fracture pattern begins with very low ramification when the stress field exceeds the threshold value only at few positions on the fracture interface .",
    "later it evolves to a much more ramified pattern due to the increase of the stress fields at the tips of the mature pattern .",
    "_ the scaling properties of the backbone reflect this cross - over_. we propose that this effect is responsible for the cross - over in the roughening exponent of the backbone .",
    "on the other hand , this non - stationarity in the geometric characteristics should be handled with care , since it may mean that there is no definite roughening exponent , as it may depend on _ where _ the analysis is done , near the center of the fracture patterns or near the edge .",

    "the development of the @xmath45 then follows the same lines as before .    to compute @xmath157 at the boundary of the crack we use the fact that follows directly from the definitions that @xmath158=4\\text{re}\\left[\\frac{\\tilde \\varphi'(\\omega)}{\\phi^{'(n)}(\\omega)}\\right ] \\ .\\ ] ] since this is the trace of the stress tensor , which is invariant under smooth coordinate transformation , it is also equal to @xmath159 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath160 vanishes on the boundary we can write finally @xmath161 \\ .\\ ] ] this result is of some importance ; it shows that to compute the component @xmath157 of the stress tensor _ on the boundary _ we do not need to compute @xmath162 at all . of course , to know the stress tensor anywhere else in the body we need both functions .",
    "for the growth algorithm this is not necessary .",
    "we note that @xmath163 is computed from eqs .",
    "( [ power_sol1 ] ) , and this contains only @xmath164 with negative @xmath165 . in order to derive a numerical scheme to compute the tangent stress component @xmath157 on the crack we now truncate the series for @xmath163 to get an approximation @xmath166 we see from eq .",
    "( [ power_sol1 ] ) that if we wish to compute this series up to an order n , we need to compute the coefficients @xmath167 up to @xmath168 and then solve the linear system ( [ power_sol1 ] ) .",
    "note that the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ uapprox ] ) corresponds to a truncation of the series ( [ expmap ] ) which in turn corresponds to a truncation of the conformal map @xmath45 .",
    "since we are interested in the macroscopic stress distribution along the fracture rather than in the bumpy microstructure , this effect is of no harm as long as we choose n large enough to resolve the desired patterns .",
    "the actual fracture patterns that we find for modes i and ii are dramatically different from those found for mode iii for the same velocity law . in fig .",
    "[ mode12 ] we show the fracture patterns for the linear velocity law after about 800 fracture events .",
    "first , mode i and ii are very similar , except for the obvious forty - five degree tilt in mode ii due to the tilt of the symmetry axis of the loading .",
    "the highly ramified structure seen in mode iii is gone , and the resulting patterns are more akin to the exponential velocity law in mode iii , cf . fig .",
    "[ mode3exp2 ] .",
    "the roughening plot @xmath106 is also qualitatively different from mode iii with the same velocity law .",
    "we do not observe a cross over to a higher exponent , indicating that there is no increased roughening at large scales .",
    "for mode i fracture , averaged over 11 fracture patterns .",
    "the line indicates a slope of 0.5 . ]    indeed , for these modes of fracture the stress field is found to be very highly peaked at the tip of the fracture pattern .",
    "moreover , when there appear deviations towards side branching they are quickly corrected in later growth . to make this point clearer we present in fig .",
    "[ sigmadist ] the stress field at the boundary of the crack in the vicinity of the tip .",
    "one can observe that the stress component is such that the slight tilt of the tip will be corrected at the next growth event .",
    "we therefore do not expect large scale roughening in this mode of fracture .",
    "lastly , we present cracks with quenched disorder .",
    "first we followed the growth of a crack in mode i , using the same strategy of subsect .",
    "[ quenched ] . in fig .",
    "[ modeiquench ] show for example the crack obtained with @xmath7 taken from a flat distribution with @xmath169 .",
    "contrary to the case of mode iii the effect of quenched disorder on the roughening is not impressive .",
    "the roughening exponent is still about 0.5 for small scales , with a failure to roughen on the large scales .",
    "this finding remains invariant to changing the type of quenched disorder to a power law like eq.([psigma ] ) .",
    "we also do not observe roughening on the large scales when we put quenched disorder , and grow deterministically at the point of highest value of @xmath170 .",
    "taken from a flat distribution .",
    "the pattern is similar to the one in fig .",
    "[ mode12 ] , with the same roughening behavior . ]",
    "we have presented a solution of the problem quasi - static fracture using the method of iterated conformal map .",
    "all modes of fracture can be treated , although mode iii is much more straightforward since the equation to be solved is the laplace equation .",
    "the bi - laplacian equation that is involved in mode i and ii requires heavier analysis and more cumbersome numerics .",
    "notwithstanding , we believe that our fracture patterns represent accurate solutions of the problem with the stated laws of evolution .",
    "the geometric characteristics of mode iii are different from those of modes i and ii .",
    "the fracture pattern is very ramified , and if we look at the backbone , ( which is what is observed as the boundary between the two parts of the broken material ) , we find that it is rough on all scales . on smaller scales",
    "the roughening exponent is about 0.5 , and on larger scales the roughening increases , having an average roughening exponent which depends on the length of the fracture pattern analyzed .",
    "the exponent 0.5 is intimately related to the randomness that is introduced by our growth rules .",
    "the higher apparent exponents are due to the increased ramification on the larger scales as is explained in sect.[results3 ] .",
    "the roughening plots may appear to be in close agreement with some experimental observations , which however are not conducted as mode iii .",
    "experimentally one expects that modes i and ii are more relevant , but here we do not observe the cross over to roughness characterized by exponents of the order of 0.75 . quite on the opposite , it appears that the roughness saturates , leading to a globally flat fracture patterns on the large scales .",
    "this leaves us with the question of how to interpret the observed roughness in experiments .",
    "one possibility is that experiments are not quasi - static .",
    "we do not have much to say about this possibility .",
    "another possibility is that in experiments the material has remnant stresses and other sources of quenched disorder .",
    "this is a possibility that we can put to test .",
    "indeed , we find that mode iii is very sensitive to quenched disorder , cf . subsect .",
    "[ quenched ] . with power law disorder",
    "we can change the geometric characteristic of the fracture patterns altogether .",
    "this is not the case however with modes i and ii , where the priority of the tip in attracting the stress field is overwhelming . these cracks do not appear to roughen on the large scales even with quenched disorder .    in summary , we believe that the experimental observations pose an interesting riddle whose resolution will need a careful assessment of the experimental conditions and their inclusion in the theory .",
    "it is our hope that the solution presented above will turn out to be a useful tool in achieving this goal .",
