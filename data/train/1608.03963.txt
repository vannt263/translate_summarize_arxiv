    "in 1911 , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermann_weyl[hermann weyl ] , who at that time was a young german mathematician specializing in partial differential and integral equations , proved the following remarkable asymptotic formula describing distribution of ( large ) eigenvalues of the dirichlet laplacian in a bounded domain @xmath0 : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of eigenvalues of the ( positive ) laplacian , which are less than @xmath3 @xmath2 is called the _ eigenvalue counting function_. ] , @xmath4 is a volume of the unit ball in @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the volume of @xmath7 .",
    "this formula was actually conjectured independently by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnold_sommerfeld[arnold  sommerfeld ] @xcite and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hendrik_lorentz[hendrik  lorentz ] @xcite in 1910 who stated the _ weyl s law _ as a conjecture based on the book of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_william_strutt,_3rd_baron_rayleigh[lord rayleigh ] `` https://archive.org/details/theoryofsound02raylrich[the theory of sound ] '' ( 1887 ) ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "h.  weyl published several papers @xcite(19111915 ) devoted to the eigenvalue asymptotics for the laplace operator ( and also the elasticity operator ) in a bounded domain with regular boundary . in @xcite , he published what is now known as _",
    "weyl s conjecture _",
    "@xmath8 for dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions respectively where @xmath9 is the @xmath10-dimensional volume of @xmath11 .",
    "both these formulae appear in the toy model of a rectangular box @xmath12 and then @xmath2 is the number of integer lattice points in the part of ellipsoid @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 for dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions respectively finding sharp asymptotics of the number of the lattice points in the inflated domain is an important problem of the number theory . ] .",
    "after his pioneering work , a huge number of papers devoted to spectral asymptotics were published .",
    "mong the authors were numerous prominent mathematicians .",
    "after h.  weyl , the next big step was made by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_courant[richard courant ] @xcite(1920 ) , who further developed the variational method and recovered the remainder estimate @xmath16 .",
    "the variational method was developed further by many mathematicians , but it lead to generalizations rather than to getting sharp remainder estimates and we postpone its discussion until section  [ sect-3 - 2 ] . here",
    "we mention only https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%91%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd%2c_%d0%9c%d0%b8%d1%85%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bb_%d0%a8%d0%bb%d1%91%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87[mikhail birman ] , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elliott_h._lieb[elliott lieb ] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barry_simon[barry simon ] and their schools .",
    "the next development was due to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torsten_carleman[torsten carleman ] @xcite(1934 , 1936 ) who invented the _",
    "tauberian method _ and was probably the first to consider an arbitrary spacial dimension ( h.  weyl and r.  courant considered only dimensions @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) followed by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_levitan[boris levitan ] @xcite(1952 ) and v.  g.  avakumovi @xcite(1956 ) who , applied _ hyperbolic operator method _",
    "( see section  [ sect-1 - 2 ] ) to recover the remainder estimate @xmath19 , but only for closed manifolds and also for @xmath20 away from the boundary where here and below @xmath21 is the schwartz kernel of the spectral projector . ] .",
    "after this , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lars_h%c3%b6rmander[lars  hrmander ] @xcite(1968 , 1969 ) applied fourier integral operators in the framework of this method .",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_duistermaat[hans  duistermaat ] and victor  guillemin @xcite(1975 ) recovered the remainder estimate @xmath22 under the assumption that    [ 1 - 1 - 3 ] the set of all periodic geodesics has measure @xmath23    observing that for the sphere neither this assumption nor ( [ 1 - 1 - 2 ] ) hold . here , we consider the phase space @xmath24 equipped with the standard measure @xmath25 where @xmath7 is a manifold in fact the general scalar pseudodifferential operator and hamiltonian trajectories of its principal symbol were considered . ] .",
    "this was a very important step since it connected the sharp spectral asymptotics with classical dynamics .",
    "the main obstacle was the impossibility to construct the parametrix of the hyperbolic problem near the boundary or even inside for elliptic systems with the eigenvalues of the principal symbol having the variable multiplicity . ] .",
    "this obstacle was partially circumvented by robert  seeley  @xcite(1978 , 1980 ) who recovered remainder estimate @xmath19 ; his approach we will consider in subsection  [ sect-4 - 1 - 2 ] .",
    "finally the author  @xcite(1980 ) , using very different approach , proved ( [ 1 - 1 - 2 ] ) under assumption that    [ 1 - 1 - 4 ] the set of all periodic geodesic billiards has measure @xmath23 ,    which obviously generalizes ( [ 1 - 1 - 3 ] ) .",
    "using this approach , the author in  @xcite ( 1982 ) proved ( [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 1 - 1 - 2 ] ) for elliptic systems on manifolds without boundary ; ( [ 1 - 1 - 2 ] ) was proven under certain assumption similar to ( [ 1 - 1 - 3 ] ) .",
    "the new approaches were further developed during the 35 years to follow and many new ideas were implemented .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide a brief and rather incomplete survey of the results and techniques .",
    "beforehand , let us mention that the field was drastically transformed .",
    "first , at that time , in addition to the problem that we described above , there were similar but distinct problems which we describe by examples :    1 .",
    "[ sect-1 - 1-b ] find the asymptotics as @xmath26 of @xmath2 for the schrdinger operator @xmath27 in @xmath5 with potential @xmath28 at infinity ; 2 .",
    "[ sect-1 - 1-c ] find the asymptotics as @xmath29 of @xmath2 for the schrdinger operator in @xmath5 with potential @xmath30 at infinity ( decaying more slowly than @xmath31 ) ; 3 .",
    "[ sect-1 - 1-d ] find the asymptotics as @xmath32 of @xmath33 the number of the negative eigenvalues for the schrdinger operator @xmath34 .",
    "these four problems were being studied separately albeit by rather similar methods .",
    "however , it turned out that the latter problem [ sect-1 - 1-d ] is more fundamental than the others which could be reduced to it by the variational _ birman - schwinger principle_.    second , we should study the _ local semiclassical spectral asymptotics _",
    ", i.e. the asymptotics of @xmath35 where @xmath36 supported in the ball of radius @xmath37 in which actually , in the proportionally larger ball .",
    "] @xmath38 is of magnitude @xmath37 sometimes , however , we consider _ pointwise semiclassical spectral asymptotics _ , i.e. asymptotics of @xmath39 . ] . by means of scaling we",
    "generalize these results for @xmath40 supported in the ball of radius @xmath41 in which @xmath38 is of magnitude @xmath42 with @xmath43 because in scaling @xmath44 .",
    "then in the general case we apply partition of unity with _ scaling functions _ @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "third , in the _ singular zone _ @xmath47b we can apply variational estimates and combine them with the semiclassical estimates in the _ regular zone _ @xmath48 .",
    "it allows us to consider domains and operators with singularities .",
    "some further developments will be either discussed or mentioned in the next sections .",
    "currently , i am working on the monster book  @xcite which summarizes this development .",
    "it is almost ready and is available online and we will often refer to it for details , exact statements and proofs .    finally , i should mention that in addition to the variational methods and method of hyperbolic operator , other methods were developed : other tauberian methods ( like the method of the heat equation or the method of resolvent ) and the almost - spectral projector method @xcite .",
    "however , we will neither use nor even discuss them ; for survey of different methods , see @xcite .",
    "the method of the hyperbolic operator is one of the tauberian methods proposed by t.  carleman .",
    "applied to the laplace operator , it was designed as follows : let @xmath21 be the schwartz kernel of a spectral projector and let @xmath49 observe , that now @xmath50 is the spectral parameter .",
    "then , @xmath51 is a _",
    "propagator _ of the corresponding wave equation and satisfies @xmath52 ( recall that @xmath53 is a positive laplacian ) .",
    "now we need to construct the solution of ( [ 1 - 2 - 2])([1 - 2 - 3 ] ) and recover @xmath54 from ( [ 1 - 2 - 1 ] ) .",
    "however , excluding some special cases , we can construct the solution @xmath51 only modulo smooth functions and only for @xmath55 , where usually @xmath56 is a small constant .",
    "it leads to @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the fourier transform , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 in fact , there is a complete decomposition . ] .    then using hrmander s tauberian theorem which was already known to boris  levitan . ]",
    ", we can recover @xmath63    to get the remainder estimate @xmath64 instead , we need some extra arguments . first , the asymptotics ( [ 1 - 2 - 4 ] ) holds with a cut - off : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a @xmath23-order pseudo - differewntial operator ( acting with respect to @xmath67 only , before we set @xmath68 ; and @xmath69 is a small enough constant .",
    "then the tauberian theory implies that @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a natural measure on the _ energy level surface _ @xmath72 and we denote by @xmath73 the support of the symbol @xmath74 .    on the other hand , propagation of singularities ( which we discuss in more details later ) implies that if for any point @xmath75 geodesics starting there are not periodic with periods @xmath76 then asymptotics ( [ 1 - 2 - 6 ] ) and ( [ 1 - 2 - 7 ] ) hold with @xmath56",
    ".    now , under the assumption ( [ 1 - 1 - 4 ] ) , for any @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we can select @xmath79 and @xmath80 , such that @xmath81 , @xmath82 and for @xmath83 geodesics starting from it are not periodic with periods @xmath76 . then , combining ( [ 1 - 2 - 7 ] ) with @xmath84 and with @xmath85 , we arrive to @xmath86 with arbitrarily large @xmath56 and arbitrarily small @xmath78 and therefore @xmath87 holds . in these settings , @xmath88 .",
    "more delicate analysis of the propagation of singularities allows under certain very restrictive assumptions to the geodesic flow to boost the remainder estimate to @xmath89 and even to @xmath90 with a sufficiently small exponent @xmath91 .",
    "as we mentioned , the approach described above was based on the representation of the solution @xmath51 by an oscillatory integral and does not fare well in ( i ) domains with boundaries because of the trajectories tangent to the boundary and ( ii ) for matrix operators whose principal symbols have eigenvalues of variable multiplicity .",
    "let us describe our main method .",
    "we start by discussing matrix operators on closed manifolds .",
    "so , let us consider a self - adjoint elliptic matrix operator @xmath92 of order @xmath93",
    ". for simplicity , let us assume that this operator is semibounded from below and we are interested in @xmath94 , the number of eigenvalues not exceeding @xmath3 , as @xmath95 .",
    "in other words , we are looking for the number @xmath33 of negative eigenvalues of the operator @xmath96 with @xmath97 if operator is not semi - bounded we consider the number of eigenvalues in the interval @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 ) which could be reduced to the asymptotics of the number of eigenvalues in the interval @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 ) of @xmath102 . ] .",
    "thus , we are now dealing with the semiclassical asymptotics .",
    "therefore , instead of individual functions , we should consider families of functions depending on the _ semiclassical parameter _",
    "@xmath103 which in quantum mechanics is called planck constant and usually is denoted by @xmath104 . ]",
    "and we need a _",
    "semiclassical microlocal analysis_.",
    "we call such family _ temperate _ if @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes usual @xmath107-norm .",
    "we say that @xmath108 is _",
    "@xmath109-negligible _ at @xmath110 if there exists a symbol @xmath111 , @xmath112 such that @xmath113 .",
    "we call the _ wave front set of @xmath114 _ the set of points at which @xmath114 is not negligible and denote by @xmath115 ; this is a closed set . here , @xmath116 .",
    "our first result is rather trivial : if @xmath117 , @xmath118 where @xmath119 ; we call @xmath120 the _ principal symbol _ of @xmath121 and @xmath122 the _ characteristic set _ of @xmath123 .    we need to study the propagation of singularities ( wave front sets ) . to do this",

    "this time , we can not decompose it as the difference of two integrals because each of them is diverging at infinity ( since @xmath949 decays there not fast enough ) .",

    "this changes both the thomas - fermi theory and properties of the thomas - fermi potential @xmath1553 and thomas - fermi density @xmath1552 .",
    "finally , as we using scaling to bring our problem to the standard one , we get that in the zone @xmath1619 , the effective semiclassical parameter is @xmath1620 which leads to @xmath1621 again exactly as for @xmath1610 .    as a result , assuming that @xmath1622 , we can recover asymptotics for the ground state energy @xmath1485 with the scott correction term but with the remainder estimate @xmath1623 . for @xmath1599 and @xmath1547 ,",
    "our estimates are almost as good ( provided @xmath1624 ) , but deteriorate when both @xmath1625 and @xmath183 are large .",
    "the main obstacles we need to overcome are that now @xmath1553 is not infinitely smooth but only belongs to the class @xmath1627 and that for @xmath1599 , the nondegeneracy assumption ( @xmath1628 after rescaling ) fails .      on the other hand , for @xmath1629 , the the main contributions to the ( approximate ) electronic charge and the energy @xmath1607 come from the zone @xmath1630 and ( for @xmath1613 ) @xmath1631 if @xmath1632 but @xmath1633 if @xmath1617 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath1634 .",
    "further , as we using scaling to bring our problem to the standard one , we see that in the zone @xmath1635 , the effective semiclassical parameter is @xmath1636 and therefore unless @xmath1637 , the semiclassical approximation fails and the correct answer should be expressed in completely different terms @xcite .        again the main obstacles we need to overcome are that now @xmath1553 is not infinitely smooth but only belongs to @xmath1627 and that for @xmath1599 , the nondegeneracy assumption ( @xmath1628 after rescaling ) fails .    for details , exact statement and proofs ,",
    "see sections  [ book_new - sect-26 - 1 ] and  [ book_new - sect-26 - 6 ] of @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the left - hand expression of ( [ 7 - 3 - 5 ] ) and are able to obtain results similar to those mentioned in section  [ sect-7 - 4 ] . for details and proofs , see sections  [ book_new - sect-26 - 7][book_new - sect-26 - 8 ] of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1641 where @xmath646 is an unknown magnetic field and the underlined term is its energy .",
    "one can prove that an `` optimal '' magnetic field exists ( for given parameters @xmath1642 ) but we do not know if it is unique if it was unique , then for @xmath1622 , the spherical symmetry would imply that @xmath1643 . ] .    using the same arguments as before",
    ", we can reduce this problem to the one - particle problem with @xmath1644 replaced by @xmath1645 plus some other terms .",
    "however , in the estimate from below , most of the terms do not depend on @xmath646 and in the estimate from above , we pick up @xmath646 .",
    "then after the usual rescalings , the problem is reduced to the problem of minimizing @xmath1646 and then the optimal magnetic potential @xmath646 must satisfy @xmath1647 where @xmath391 is the schwartz kernel of the spectral projector @xmath1648 of @xmath1649 and @xmath1502 is the matrix trace . as usual , we are mainly interested in @xmath1650 ( and then @xmath1651 ) .",
    "first , ( [ 7 - 5 - 6 ] ) allows us to claim a certain smoothness of @xmath646 .",
    "second , the right - hand expression is something we studied in pointwise spectral asymptotics , and the weyl expression here is @xmath23 , so the right - hand expression of ( [ 7 - 5 - 6 ] ) is something that we could estimate",
    ". surely , it is not that simple but improving our methods in the case of smooth @xmath620 , we are able to prove that @xmath646 is so small that the ordinary asymptotics with remainder estimates @xmath954 and @xmath407 would hold in both the pointwise asymptotics and the trace asymptotics . moreover , under standard conditions",
    ", we would be able to get the remainder estimates @xmath955 and @xmath956 in the eigenvalue counting and the trace asymptotics respectively .",
    "however , in reality , the above is not exactly true since @xmath620 has coulomb - like singularities @xmath1652 with @xmath1653 . if @xmath1622 , @xmath1654 , a singularity leads us to the scott correction term @xmath1655 derived in the same way as without a self - generated magnetic field .",
    "however , we do not have an explicit formula for @xmath1656",
    "; we even do not know its properties except that it is non - increasing function of @xmath1657 ; we even do not know if we can take @xmath1658 .",
    "if the optimal magnetic potential @xmath646 was unique , then @xmath1643 and @xmath1659 , which corresponds to this term without a magnetic field .",
    "then as @xmath1599 , the scott correction term is @xmath1660 in the general case .",
    "however , as @xmath1661 we need to decouple singularities as all of them are served by the same @xmath646 and it leads to decoupling errors depending on the internuclei distance .      as a result",
    ", we derive the ground state asymptotics with the scott correction term @xmath1662 .",
    "we also estimate the left - hand expression of ( [ 7 - 3 - 5 ] ) and are able to obtain results similar to those mentioned in section  [ sect-7 - 4 ] . for details , exact statements and proofs , see sections  [ book_new - sect-27 - 3][book_new - sect-27 - 4 ] of @xcite .",
    "we can also combine a constant strong external magnetic field and a self - generated magnetic field .",
    "results are very similar to those of subsection  [ sect-7 - 5 - 1 ] , but this time , the scott correction term and the decoupling errors are like in subsection  [ sect-7 - 5 - 2 ] . for details , exact statements and proofs , see chapter  [ book_new - sect-28 ] of @xcite ."
