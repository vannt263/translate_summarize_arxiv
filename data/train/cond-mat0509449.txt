    "recently there is an increasing research activity on the role of noise in spatially extended systems @xcite .",
    "one of the challenging problems to be understood is the formation of large scale spatial correlations . in this work we present a theoretical investigation on the role played by the colored noise in the transient dynamics of the spatial distributions of two competing species .",
    "the colored noise in spatially extended systems has been investigated in the past @xcite ( and references cited there ) , @xcite .",
    "aim of the work is to present a stochastic model with a realistic noise and to suggest a possibility of application to biological systems , where the presence of fluctuations , such as random variability of temperature , can modify strongly the dynamics of an ecosystem  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results in fact may be compared with the experimental data obtained for the biomass of species measured in the sicily channel  @xcite . our investigation could contribute ( i ) to select environmental forcings which affect the dynamics of biological systems  @xcite , and ( ii ) to implement physical models for the interpretation of spatial distributions of marine species .",
    "to study the colored noise effect on the formation of large scale spatial correlations of two species densities , we consider a coupled map lattice model  @xcite    -0.2 cm    @xmath0    -0.2 cm where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the densities of two species in the site ( @xmath3 ) at the time step @xmath4 , @xmath5 is proportional to the growth rate , @xmath6 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath7 is the sum over the four nearest neighbors , and @xmath8 is the interaction parameter .",
    "here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are ornstein  uhlenbeck colored noises at each site ( @xmath3 ) , and correspond to the value of the stochastic continuous process @xmath11 given by the equation    -0.2 cm @xmath12 taken at the time step _ n_. here @xmath13 @xmath14 are gaussian white noises within the ito scheme with zero mean and correlation function @xmath15 .",
    "the correlation function of the processes of eq .",
    "( @xmath16 ) is @xmath17 and gives @xmath18 in the limit @xmath19 . in absence of noise , for @xmath20 both species survives in a coexistence regime , while for @xmath21 one of the two species vanishes after a certain time and an exclusion regime takes places . to describe the noisy interaction between species and the environment we consider an ito stochastic differential equation for the parameter @xmath22 with a periodical driving force  @xcite    @xmath23    here @xmath24 describes the two stable states of the ecological system ( coexistence and exclusion )    @xmath25    the values of the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "depend on intrinsic biological characteristics of the species , as stability of their life cycles respect to external perturbations and ability of one species to compensate the increase or decrease of the other species .",
    "the periodical driving mimics the climatic temperature oscillations , and @xmath29 is a white gaussian noise with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath8 of eqs .",
    "( [ lotka_eq_1 ] ) , ( [ lotka_eq_2 ] ) corresponds to the value of the stochastic process @xmath32 of eq .",
    "( [ beta_eq ] ) taken at the time step _ n_. in the absence of the additive noise , @xmath32 oscillates periodically and its values always remain below @xmath33 , giving rise to a coexistence regime .",
    "we fix the additive noise intensity at the value @xmath34 corresponding to a competition regime with @xmath22 periodically switching from coexistence to exclusion regions .",
    "this produces the appearance of stochastic resonance ( sr ) effect in the dynamics of interaction parameter @xmath22 and noise - induced anticorrelated periodic oscillations in the time evolution of the two species densities  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the spatial distribution of the ecosystem in this sr dynamical regime , by varying both the intensities of multiplicative colored noise in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .      by using a square spatial lattice with @xmath35 sites , and species densities vanishing on the grid borders ,",
    "we obtain the spatio - temporal distributions of the two species for uniform initial condition and for three values of the correlation time @xmath36 , namely @xmath37 .",
    "we find that for the lowest value of the correlation time ( @xmath38 ) , the spatial distribution is almost the same as that found for multiplicative white noise @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the spatial distributions of the two species are obtained with correlation time @xmath39 and for @xmath40 .",
    "we see that for very low noise intensity ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) the spatial distributions of the species are uniform as at @xmath41 . for higher noise intensities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) an anticorrelation between the two species is observed : the two species tend to occupy different positions",
    ". further increase of the noise causes the anticorrelation to disappear and the two species densities become uncorrelated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) .",
    "we observe that anticorrelated behavior is stronger for increasing @xmath36 .",
    "in particular by comparing the distributions obtained with different values of correlation time @xmath36 we note that for @xmath42 the two species densities are strongly anticorrelated .",
    "this is expressed by the presence , in the same spatial region , of a high density ( dark zones ) of species 1 ( species 2 ) corresponding to a low density ( light zones ) of species 2 ( species 1 ) ( see figs .  [ fig1](b ) ) .      to analyze the role of the colored noise on the correlation between the two species , we calculate for different values of the correlation time @xmath36 , at the time step @xmath4 , the correlation coefficient @xmath43 defined on the lattice as @xmath44 with @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the mean value and the root mean square respectively of species 1 and species 2 , obtained over the whole spatial grid at the time step @xmath4 , @xmath50 is the corresponding covariance and @xmath51 is the number of sites of the considered lattice .",
    "the behavior of the correlation coefficient @xmath43 as a function of time has been obtained for @xmath37 , and for different levels of the multiplicative colored noise . for @xmath52 the species are strongly correlated and @xmath43 is constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we report the behavior of @xmath43 for @xmath38 .    for low levels of the multiplicative colored noise ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , the values of @xmath43 oscillate between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , showing a stronger correlation between species for lower values of @xmath57 .",
    "for intermediate values of noise intensity , namely for @xmath58 the spatial correlation coefficient @xmath59 oscillates between @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the frequency of the periodical forcing , showing strong anticorrelation between the two species . by increasing the noise intensity ,",
    "the anticorrelation is reduced and finally it disappears ( @xmath62 ) , that is the species are totally uncorrelated . a nonmonotonic behavior of the correlation coefficient as a function of the multiplicative intensity appears clearly .",
    "this behavior is more evident by considering the time average correlation coefficient @xmath63 as a function of the multiplicative noise intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "the minimum in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) corresponds to the anticorrelated oscillations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "moreover this behavior is connected with the anticorrelated oscillations present in the time evolution of two competing species in each point of our spatial grid @xcite . by comparing the results shown in fig .  2 with the white noise case @xcite",
    "we observe that the effect of a small correlation time @xmath36 is to produce an enlargement of the minimum of @xmath63 towards higher values of the multiplicative noise intensity .",
    "the ecosystem remains in his anticorrelated regime for a longer time due to the memory of the colored noise .",
    "the two noise sources have different roles on the dynamics of our ecosystem .",
    "specifically the additive noise affects directly the dynamical regime , while the multiplicative noise breaks the symmetric dynamical behavior of the two species by producing a coherent response of the system  @xcite , which is responsible for the appearance of anticorrelation in the spatial distributions of the two species . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the behavior of @xmath43 and @xmath63 is reported for @xmath39 .",
    "as in the previous case we observe a nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath43 as a function of the multiplicative noise intensity . for low noise intensities ( @xmath54 , @xmath64 ) , the species are strongly correlated and @xmath43 is almost constant . for @xmath65 strong oscillations between @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "this effect is due to the colored noise , in fact the ecosystem remains periodically in the correlated or anticorrelated regime for a time interval of the order of the correlation time of the noise . for greater noise intensity ( @xmath68 ) , the anticorrelation regime takes place ( @xmath69 ) . by increasing the noise intensity ( @xmath70 )",
    ", @xmath43 goes through a nonmonotonic behavior , taking on values around zero ( uncorrelated regime ) . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we observe that the presence of a bigger correlation time @xmath36 determines a stronger anticorrelation in the two species distributions .",
    "the minimum of the time average correlation time @xmath63 is deeper and it is shifted towards higher values of the multiplicative noise intensity for greater values of correlation time @xmath36 .",
    "a highly correlated noise therefore produces two effects : ( i ) the system is pushed towards a strongly anticorrelated regime ( @xmath71 ) ; ( ii ) this regime takes place for higher values of multiplicative noise intensity .",
    "the colored noise produces therefore a persistence of the dynamical regime experienced by the ecosystem .",
    "in this work we analyze the effects of the colored noise in the spatial distributions of two competing species . by using a discrete time evolution model , which is the discrete version of the lotka ",
    "volterra equations with diffusive terms , in the presence of a multiplicative colored noise , with a random interaction parameter , we analyze the spatio - temporal behavior of the two species .",
    "we find that the colored noise determines an enhancement of the effects observed in the presence of white noise  @xcite , that is ( i ) formation of large scale spatial correlations with the same periodicity of the deterministic force and ( ii ) anticorrelation in the spatial distributions of the two species .",
    "finally we observe that ( i ) the intensity of the anticorrelation increases as a function of @xmath36 , ( ii ) the system remains in the anticorrelated region for a bigger range of multiplicative noise values as @xmath36 increases .",
    "the noise spectrum of a real physical system is characterized by a cut - off ( correlated noise ) .",
    "therefore data from real ecosystems , whose dynamics is strongly affected by fluctuations and by environmental physical variables , can be modeled using sources of colored noise .",
