    "nuclear physics is an essential piece in the present understanding of many astrophysical processes related to the energy generation and nucleosynthesis in stellar scenarios .",
    "the properties of both stable and exotic nuclei play different roles at different stages of stellar evolution .",
    "while the former are relevant to describe steady regimes , the latter are implicated in the description of explosive events .",
    "network calculations and astrophysical models rely on the quality of the input information , in particular , on the quality of the nuclear input .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental information available for exotic nuclei is still very short and thus , most of the astrophysical simulations of violent phenomena must be based on nuclear model predictions of limited quality and accuracy .",
    "this is the case of the x - ray bursts , generated by a thermonuclear runaway in the hydrogen - rich environment of an accreting compact object ( typically a neutron star ) which is fed from a binary companion ( typically a red giant ) .",
    "the ignition takes place on the surface of the neutron star at high densities ( @xmath1 ) and temperatures ( @xmath2 ) , and eventually peak conditions of @xmath31 - 3 gk and @xmath4-@xmath5 g @xmath6 are reached @xcite .",
    "the mechanism leading to x - ray bursts is the rapid proton ( @xmath0 ) capture process @xcite , which is characterized by proton capture reaction rates that are orders of magnitude faster than any other competing process , in particular @xmath7-decay .",
    "it produces rapid nucleosynthesis on the proton - rich side of stability toward heavier proton - rich nuclei and the energy observed in x - ray bursts .",
    "nuclear reaction network calculations ( the set of differential equations for the various isotopic abundances ) are performed @xcite to follow the time evolution of the isotopic abundances , to determine the amount of energy released by nuclear reactions , and to find the reaction path for the @xmath0 process . in general",
    ", the reaction path follows a series of fast proton - capture reactions until further proton capture is inhibited .",
    "then the reaction flow has to wait for a relatively slow @xmath7-decay and the respective nucleus is called a waiting point ( wp ) .",
    "the half - lives of the wp nuclei along the reaction path determine the time scale of the nucleosynthesis process and the produced isotopic abundances . in this respect ,",
    "the weak decay rates of neutron - deficient medium - mass nuclei under stellar conditions play a relevant role to understand the @xmath0 process .",
    "the nuclear structure problem involved in the calculation of these rates must be treated in a reliable way .",
    "in particular , this implies that the nuclear models should be able to describe at least the experimental information available on the decay properties ( gamow - teller strength distributions and @xmath7-decay half - lives ) measured under terrestrial conditions .",
    "although these decay properties may be different at the high @xmath1 and @xmath2 existing in @xmath0-process scenarios , success in their description under terrestrial conditions is a requirement for a reliable calculation of the weak decay rates in more general conditions . with this aim in mind",
    ", we study in this letter the dependence of the decay rates on both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , using a nuclear model that has been tested successfully and reproduces the experimental information available on both bulk and decay properties of medium - mass nuclei very reasonably .",
    "this model is the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) . here ,",
    "we focus our attention to the deformed wp isotopes @xmath8kr and @xmath9sr , where the gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions have been measured with high accuracy by @xmath7-decay over most of the @xmath10-window @xcite and are well reproduced by theoretical calculations based on deformed qrpa @xcite .",
    "while the half - lives give only a limited information of the decay ( different strength distributions may lead to the same half - life ) , the strength distribution contains all the information .",
    "it is the first time that the weak decay rates under stellar @xmath0 conditions can be studied using a nuclear structure model that reproduces the gt strength distributions and half - lives under terrestrial conditions @xcite .",
    "there are several distinctions between terrestrial and stellar decay rates caused by the effect of high @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the main effect of @xmath2 is related to the thermal population of excited states in the decaying nucleus , accompanied by the corresponding depopulation of the ground states .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the weak decay rates of excited states can be significantly different from those of the ground state , enhancing the total decay rates .",
    "a case by case consideration is needed .",
    "another effect related to the high @xmath1 and @xmath2 comes from the fact that atoms in these scenarios will be completely ionized and the electrons will be no longer bound to the nuclei , but forming a degenerate plasma obeying a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this opens the possibility for continuum electron captures ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "these effects make weak interaction rates in the stellar interior sensitive functions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , with @xmath12 gk and @xmath4 g @xmath6 , as the most relevant conditions for the @xmath0 process @xcite .",
    "the general formalism to calculate weak interaction rates in stellar environments as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 was introduced in the pioneering work of fuller , fowler , and newman @xcite .",
    "further improvements have come mainly on the nuclear structure aspect , either from the shell model @xcite or from qrpa @xcite .",
    "the decay rate of the parent nucleus is given by @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the angular momentum ( excitation energy ) of the parent nucleus state @xmath15 , and thermal equilibrium is assumed . in principle , the sum extends over all populated states in the parent nucleus up to the proton separation energy .",
    "however , since the range of @xmath2 for the @xmath0-process peaks at @xmath12 gk ( @xmath16 kev ) , only a few low - lying excited states are expected to contribute significantly in the decay .",
    "specifically , we consider in this work all the ( collective ) low - lying excited states below 1 mev @xcite ( exception made of the @xmath17 kev in @xmath18sr ) , @xmath19 kev and @xmath20 kev in @xmath21kr ; @xmath22 kev and @xmath23 kev in @xmath24kr ; @xmath25 kev in @xmath26sr ; and @xmath27 kev in @xmath18sr .",
    "then , all these states are considered to be thermally populated although for @xmath12 gk the population is negligible beyond 500 kev . in fig .",

    "the decay rate for the parent state @xmath15 is given by    @xmath29    where the sum extends over all the states in the final nucleus reached in the decaying process .",
    "the rate @xmath30 from the initial state @xmath15 to the final state @xmath31 is given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 .",

    "for @xmath41 transitions and very neutron deficient nuclei with @xmath42 , the superallowed fermi transition to the isobaric analog state has to be taken into account .",
    "however , for @xmath43 nuclei , fermi transitions are not possible except for isospin impurities .",
    "the discussion is therefore limited to the decay via allowed gt transitions .",
    "the theoretical formalism used here to calculate the gt strengths is based on the qrpa .",
    "the quasiparticle basis corresponds to a deformed selfconsistent skyrme hartree - fock calculation with sly4 @xcite force and pairing correlations treated in bcs approximation .",
    "the residual interactions are spin - isospin forces in both particle - hole and particle - particle channels .",
    "the initial and final states in the laboratory frame are expressed in terms of the intrinsic states using the bohr - mottelson factorization @xcite , which is a very good approximation for well deformed nuclei .",
    "the effect of all these ingredients ( deformation , pairing , residual forces ) on the decay rates has been studied elsewhere @xcite and their relevance in this mass region has been stressed .",
    "more details of the formalism can be found in ref .",
