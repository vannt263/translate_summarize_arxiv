    "the presented scheme , based on heterodyne optical mixing onto a parallel detector used as a selective frequency filter , is particulary suited to high resolution spectral imaging .",
    "an tunable frequency component of the object field is acquired at a time .",
    "the camera finite exposure time and the finite measurement time lead to a frequency domain bandpass filter , which width is the reciprocal of the measurement time .",
    "the small dissymmetry of the frequency domain instrumental response should be taken into account in quantitative measurements .",
    "the available range of frequency shifts at which measurements can be made is not limited to the photo - mixer bandwidth ( contrary to wide - field laser doppler @xcite ) , and benefits from heterodyne amplification .",
    "the measurement is sensitive : thanks to the off - axis holographic setup , the self beating intensity contributions resulting from laser instabilities and scattered light self interference within the camera bandwidth can be efficiently filtered - out .",
    "the propensity to separate spatially cross terms intensity contributions from self beating contributions lies in the use of a spatial heterodyne method .",
    "the presented scheme is the association of a spatial and a temporal heterodyne detection .",
    "+ both temporal and spatial resolution are potentially high .",
    "this combination is enabled by a wide field measurement performed at one frequency point at a time .",
    "the data transfer rate bottleneck implies a tradeoff between the number of pixels in the image and the frame rate of the detector , which should be guided by the application needs in terms of temporal , spectral and spatial resolution . in a few words , combining a spatiotemporal modulation and demodulation of a coherent probe light allows one to achieve a sensitive wide field detection of a tunable hertz - resolved spectral component with an array detector .",
