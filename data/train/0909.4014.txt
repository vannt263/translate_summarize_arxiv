    "following the first observation of extensive air showers by the air fluorescence technique@xcite , the fly s eye experiment pioneered analysis techniques@xcite that are largely unchanged to this day .",
    "most relevant to this paper are the analysis techniques needed to exploit the feature of fluorescence detectors to observe directly the development profile of air showers in the atmosphere .",
    "the shower profile provides a direct measurement of the depth of shower maximum , @xmath0 in gm/@xmath1 , and provides an almost model - independent measurement of the cosmic ray energy@xcite .",
    "historically , the shower profile was parameterized@xcite using three parameter gaussian or four parameter gaisser - hillas@xcite ( gh ) functions to characterize the shower brightness _ versus _ shower depth , @xmath7(gm/@xmath1 ) .",
    "the gaussian parameterization was appealing , as it depended on distance from shower maximum , @xmath8 , and depended on one parameter to characterize the shower width . as the precision of fluorescence detector measurements improved the gaussian parameterization",
    "was discarded , as it did not model the true shape of shower profiles that are asymmetric in shower depth with respect to shower maximum .",
    "the use of the four parameter gh function was often limited by the realities of data signal uncertainties or by the limited fraction of the shower profile observed for any given shower .",
    "more recently the hires / mia collaboration@xcite analyzed a composite shower profile using three functional forms : gaisser - hillas@xcite ( noted previously ) , a form motivated by analytic shower theory and popularized by greisen@xcite ( greisen ) , and a new form motivated by the observation that showers were rather symmetric when plotted in shower age , termed _ gaussian in age _",
    "( gia)@xcite . interestingly , the three functions were almost indistinguishable and described the data comparably well .",
    "the paper found a strong correlation between two of the gh parameters and suggested that a simpler ( 3 parameter ) form should be adequate to describe the shower profiles .",
    "a closely related comparison of gh and gia functions to monte carlo simulated showers@xcite generated using corsika@xcite , again found comparably good agreement using gh or gia profile functions .",
    "interestingly the monte carlo study@xcite observed the near equality of the width at half - maximum , @xmath3 , of proton , iron and photon showers but did not exploit this fact .",
    "motivated by the history above , in this paper we write the gh , gia and greisen functions in terms of 4 parameters : the intensity at shower maximum , @xmath9 , the depth of shower maximum , @xmath0 , and two other parameters that in the case of gh are the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the introduction of @xmath10 allows for a more symmetrical comparison to gh as well as allowing these forms to be applied to _ e.g. _ neutrino induced showers . ] . in all cases",
    "the profile functions can then be re - expressed in terms of a physical distance @xmath12 , a composite parameter , @xmath13 , and a ( forth ) dimensionless parameter , @xmath14 .",
    "we will now show that @xmath15 depends both on shower width , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath3 , and on a shower asymmetry parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter , @xmath14 depends only on the shower asymmetry , @xmath4 .",
    "we now summarize the three profile functions : gh , gia and greisen .",
    "the gaisser - hillas function@xcite is conventionally written : @xmath16    if we introduce the new variable : @xmath13 and the distance from shower maximum : @xmath12 , the gh function can then be written as : @xmath17    it is useful to introduce two dimensionless quantities : @xmath18 and @xmath19 . then a minimal form , useful for comparisons , is obtained :    @xmath20    this form emphasizes the role of a physical quantity , the distance from shower maximum , @xmath21 , in comparison to _ e.g. _ an unphysical quantity , @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore @xmath21 is scaled by a parameter @xmath15 potentially resolving a tension between @xmath0 and @xmath10 in a parameter optimization to _ fit _ experimental shower profiles .",
    "while the new variables , @xmath23 , are less intuitive than the standard gh parameters @xmath24 , we will show that they are related to two very intuitive parameters : the shower width , @xmath3 and a dimensionless shower asymmetry parameter , @xmath4 .    for later reference the integral of the gh function@xcite",
    "is given by :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the euler gamma function .",
    "the gaussian in age function@xcite is conventionally written : @xmath27    where `` @xmath28 '' is the shower age and @xmath29 at shower maximum .",
    "motivated by the definition of the gh function , the conventional definition for @xmath30 is then modified by replacing : @xmath31 and @xmath32 . then with the same definitions as used for the gh function ( above ) , the redefined age variable is : @xmath33 .",
    "note that this definition preserves @xmath29 at shower maximum and @xmath34 in the limit of @xmath35 ,  but differs from `` @xmath36 '' at other shower depths . as with the gh function , a minimal form for the gia function",
    "is obtained :    @xmath37      the greisen function@xcite is conventionally written@xcite : @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the depth in the shower in radiation lengths , @xmath40 is the depth of shower maximum and `` @xmath28 '' is shower age .",
    "following the modification of gia : @xmath41 and @xmath42 , then converting from depth in radiation lengths to depth in gm/@xmath1 , @xmath43 , and using the same notation as for gh and gia ( above ) we obtain the minimal form :    @xmath44    where the conversion constant `` 36.7gm/@xmath45 '' ( per radiation length ) is treated as a parameter@xcite , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that eqn .",
    "2 , 4 and 5 depend only on @xmath48 and one additional dimensionless parameter : @xmath19 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 . as noted above",
    ", we will now show that @xmath15 depends on both shower width and asymmetry : @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath14 depends only on shower asymmetry : @xmath4 .      while there are now some similarities between the three profile functions , a simple connection between the profile parameters and the appearance of a shower does not exist .",
    "a natural choice is to use the width of the shower ( at _ e.g. _ half - height ) , @xmath3 and an asymmetry parameter , @xmath4 . using the profile in fig .",
    "1(left ) , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath3 has dimensions ( gm/@xmath1 ) and @xmath4 is dimensionless .",
    "furthermore , because real and simulated shower profiles rise more steeply than they fall @xmath4 will always be less than 0.5 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a remaining issue is how best to apply four parameter shower profile functions to less than ideal data . in these circumstances",
    "the tendency is to fix , or constrain , one or more of the parameters .",
    "an equivalent point of view is the assumption that @xmath53 gm/@xmath1 in the gia or greisen function and/or that the parameter @xmath47 gm/@xmath1 ( per radiation length ) in the greisen function .    to study this issue , shower profile parameters from conex showers",
    "are shown in fig .  6 for proton showers with energies @xmath54ev .",
    "for each simulated shower , the shower @xmath3 and asymmetry , @xmath4 , are determined .",
    "the values are plotted in fig .",
    "6(lower right ) . following sect .",
    "2.5 the @xmath3 and @xmath4 values are used to determine the corresponding parameters for gh , gia and greisen profiles .",
    "the results are plotted in the other quadrants of fig .",
    "the conventional shower shape parameters : ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) , ( @xmath10,@xmath49 ) , and ( @xmath10,@xmath46 ) show significant correlations while ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) do not .",
    "in particular the correlation coefficients for gh , gia and greisen parameters are in the range : @xmath55 for conex@xcite proton and iron showers while the correlation coefficients for ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) are @xmath56 for proton showers and @xmath57 for iron showers .",
    "while the gh correlation results appear consistent with the observation of parameter correlations in ref.@xcite , our analysis does not ( then ) support the use of gia ( or greisen ) shower profiles with the @xmath10 parameter set to zero@xcite . rather than the correlation being evidence that three parameters are sufficient to describe shower profiles , it is more likely that gh , gia and greisen parameters need to fulfill the calorimetric energy constraint of eqn .",
    "7,@xmath11 ) must be compatible with the full with half maximum of the shower . ] . as noted above",
    ", this constraint is almost insignificant with the choice of variables ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) . in summary",
    "the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) shower shape parameters appear less correlated that the other shower parameter pairs ( while still assuming a wide range of values ) .",
    "that said , it is likely that shower details lead to correlations with any choice of shower parameters . in that regard , this study is compatible with shower reconstructions using partial constraints@xcite ; we recommend that the constraints be applied to @xmath3 and @xmath4 rather than the gh parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this analysis has studied three functions used to parameterize the shower profiles of ultra - high energy cosmic rays : gaisser - hillas ( gh ) , gaussian in age ( gia ) and an analytical form popularized by greisen ( greisen ) . as part of this analysis",
    ", we have generalized the gia and greisen functions to 4-parameters consistent with the gh function .",
    "to then study the relation between the three shower parameterizations , and to use more physically descriptive parameters , this work uses the shower full width half - maximum , @xmath3 , and shower asymmetry parameter , @xmath4 , to parameterize the _ shape _ of the shower profiles . for profiles with the same ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , the gh and greisen shower profiles are essentially identical and systemically less than gia for shower depths away from shower maximum .",
    "of the three functions , gh is most convenient as the integral of the gh profile is an analytic function .",
    "monte carlo simulated air showers using conex , and parameterized in terms of the new parameters : ( @xmath5 ) , have correlations ( between those parameters ) greatly reduced over the standard parameterizations _",
    "e.g. _ gaisser - hillas parameters : ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this allows shower profile reconstructions to add constraints ( if needed ) on the mostly uncorrelated parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the conex shower simulations suggest that the shower asymmetry parameter , @xmath4 , may have some sensitivity to the incident cosmic ray particle type : _ e.g. _ p , c / n / o , fe or @xmath2 .",
    "we wish to recognize discussions with miguel mostafa , paul sommers , jaroslav urbar and marcelo vogel during early work on this paper .",
