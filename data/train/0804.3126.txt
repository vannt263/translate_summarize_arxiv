    "are always observed .",
    "the period of the superhumps are a few percent longer than that of the orbital period of the system , which is attributed to prograde precession of tidally deformed accretion disc @xcite .",

    "is not only the different @xmath24 , but also the light curves themselves : a precursor was present for the 2004 superoutburst while it was absent for the 2001 superoutburst .",
    "one interpretation is that an appearance of the positive or constant / negative @xmath24 depends on the maximum radius of the accretion disc during the superoutburst @xcite . @xcite",
    "have further stated that systems which show both types of @xmath24 will be restricted to short period su uma stars , because the tidal truncation radius should be significantly larger than the 3:1 resonance radius ( see @xcite ) . with this respect ,",
    "the 2005 superoutburst of fl tra had a large disc radius , which is consistent with the large amplitude of the outburst .",
    "another important finding is that unfittable cycle counts by the equation ( 2 ) exists at the earliest stage of our run .",
