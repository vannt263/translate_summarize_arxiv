    "braneworld models give rise to interesting new physical effects @xcite . the well - known dvali  gabadadze  porrati ( dgp ) model , for instance , can lead to an accelerating universe without the presence of either a cosmological constant or some other form of dark energy @xcite .",
    "generalizations of the dgp model can result in a phantom - like acceleration of the universe at late times @xcite .",
    "this class of models can also lead to new cosmological behaviour at _ intermediate redshifts _ : the loitering @xcite and mimicry @xcite scenarios provide examples of cosmologies which are close to lcdm at late times but can show significant departure from lcdm - like expansion at @xmath6 . in both cases , the age of the high - redshift universe turns out to be larger than in lcdm , while the redshift of reionization is lower . whether the universe has properties which are easier to explain within the braneworld context is an intriguing possibility demanding further exploration . in this paper",
    ", we examine yet another property of braneworld models which does not have parallels in general relativity : the possibility that the universe may encounter a _ quiescent future singularity _ as it expands @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the rate of expansion of the universe and its ultimate fate depend on the system of equations governing evolution ( general relativity , scalar - tensor theory , braneworld theory etc . ) as well as on the form of matter and , particularly , on its equation of state . in general relativity ( gr ) , if one assumes that matter satisfies the strong energy condition ( sec ) @xmath7 , then , within a friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) setting , the evolution of the universe is strongly dependent upon the spatial curvature : a spatially closed universe turns around and collapses whereas open and flat cosmologies continue to expand forever .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated ( and interesting ! )",
    "if one of the following assumptions is made : ( i )  the expansion of the universe is not governed by gr , ( ii )  matter can violate the sec and even the weak energy condition ( wec ) @xmath8 . in the latter case , if @xmath9 , then the expanding universe can encounter a `` big rip '' future singularity at which the density , pressure , and hubble parameter diverge . in the former case ,",
    "if the equations of motion have been derived from a braneworld action @xcite , then the expanding universe can encounter a different kind of ( quiescent ) future singularity , at which the density , pressure and hubble parameter _ remain finite _ , but derivatives of the hubble parameter , including @xmath0 , diverge as the singularity is approached @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of this singularity is related to the fact that the equations of motion are no longer quasi - linear ( as they are , for instance , in gr ) but include terms which are non - linear in the highest derivative .",
    "examples of such singularities can be found in models other than the braneworld model ; for instance , @xcite refer to singularities in which the deceleration parameter tends to infinity as the `` big brake '' while , in @xcite , they are called `` sudden '' singularities ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the geometrical reason of a quiescent singularity in braneworld models is connected with the fact that the brane embedding in the bulk becomes singular at some point ( see @xcite for details ) . since quiescent singularities can occur both in the past and in the future",
    ", they might provide an interesting alternative to the more conventional `` big bang''/``big crunch '' singularities of general relativity . an important distinction between the quiescent and",
    "the sudden singularity is the following : the existence of the quiescent singularity does not require matter with unusual properties , hence , both density and pressure remain finite near this singularity . for the sudden singularity , on the other hand , the pressure diverges as the singularity is approached , implying the presence of matter with exotic properties .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the issue of how quantum effects might influence a braneworld which encounters a quiescent singularity during expansion .",
    "it is well known that quantum effects come into play when the space - time curvature becomes large , as happens , for instance , in the vicinity of a black hole or near the big - bang and big - crunch singularities of general relativity @xcite . since @xmath3 as one approaches a quiescent ( sudden ) singularity , one might expect quantum effects to become important in this case too ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . as we demonstrate in this paper , quantum corrections to the equations of motion at the semi - classical level result in several important changes in the evolution of the universe :",
    "due to the ( local ) effects of vacuum polarization , ( i )  the quiescent singularity changes its form and becomes a much weaker `` soft '' singularity , at which @xmath4 and @xmath0 remain finite but @xmath10 ; ( ii )  vacuum polarization effects can also cause a spatially flat universe to turn around and collapse . both ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "demonstrate that the incorporation of quantum effects into the braneworld equations of motion can radically alter the future of the universe and lead to behaviour which differs significantly from general - relativistic cosmology .",
    "since the quiescent singularity ( and the associated quantum effects ) arise as the density drops below a threshold value , it follows that those regions which are significantly underdense ( voids ) may be the first to encounter the quiescent singularity .",
    "we also briefly discuss whether particle production effects could be significant as the universe approaches a quiescent future singularity .",
    "an interesting possibility that may arise in this case is that the universe expands in a regime in which the hubble parameter vacillates about the de sitter value .",
    "we consider the simplest generic braneworld model with action of the form @xmath11 + \\int_{\\rm brane } \\left ( m^2 r - 2 \\sigma \\right ) + \\int_{\\rm brane } l \\left ( h_{ab } , \\phi \\right ) \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath12 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath13 in the five - dimensional bulk , and @xmath14 is the scalar curvature of the induced metric @xmath15 on the brane , where @xmath16 is the vector field of the inner unit normal to the brane , which is assumed to be a boundary of the bulk space , and the notation and conventions of @xcite are used .",

    "this assumption simplifies the situation significantly since , in this case , the stationary points of eq .",

    "we consider only the second eigenvalue , @xmath115 , so the two signs in the expressions given below always corresponds to two different equations of motion .",
    "the equations for the fixed points are @xmath119    substituting the value of @xmath120 obtained from this equation into ( [ f_2 ] ) , we can rewrite it in the form @xmath121    we classify solutions corresponding to the upper sign ( `` @xmath53 '' ) and the lower sign ( `` @xmath54 '' ) as the `` @xmath53 '' branch and `` @xmath54 '' branch , respectively .",
    "then , for the `` @xmath53 '' branch , the expression in the brackets is positive , so we make our first conclusion :    * fixed points of the `` @xmath53 '' branch are stable with respect to quantum corrections if @xmath106 .",

    "( [ fixed ] ) with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "the solutions are given by @xmath122 however , it is necessary to be careful about the two different branches .",
    "there are two possible cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath123 . in this case , we have one solution for the `` @xmath53 '' branch ( with the upper sign in ( [ solutions ] ) ) , and one solution for the `` @xmath54 '' branch ( with the lower sign in ( [ solutions ] ) ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath124 . in this case , two solutions ( [ h^2 ] ) belong to the `` @xmath54 '' branch , while the `` @xmath53 '' branch does not have fixed points .    for @xmath125",

    "consider the first situation .",
    "we already know that stability of a fixed point for the `` @xmath53 '' branch requires @xmath106 .",
    "for the `` @xmath54 '' branch , we have @xmath126 at a fixed point .",
    "as we have now @xmath127 , the second term in the brackets is always smaller than @xmath128 , so the whole expression in the brackets is positive .",
    "this implies the following conclusion :    * if the `` @xmath54 '' branch has only one stable point , its stability requires @xmath106 .    for the second case ,",
    "both solutions ( [ h^2 ] ) belong to the `` @xmath54 '' branch .",
    "the upper sign gives the same expression for @xmath117 as in ( [ odin ] ) .",

    "[ classical ] , we obtain the following picture :    the simplest case corresponds to the classical points described by fig .",
    "note that now the horizontal axis represents @xmath25 , because we are dealing with the stationary points only .",
    "each equation , with `` @xmath53 '' and `` @xmath54 '' sign , has only one possible stationary point , and these are stable for @xmath106 .    for the range of the parameter @xmath24 corresponding to fig .",

    "( [ dyn ] ) are located in the de part .",
    "their stability also requires @xmath106 .",
    "however , stationary points of the equations of motion with `` @xmath53 '' sign are located in the whole admissible region ac . for @xmath132 ( see fig .",
    "3a ) , we have two possible stationary points , one on the ab branch , and the other on the bc branch . their stability properties are opposite to each other . in particular , the unusual condition @xmath133 is required for the points on bc branch to be stable .",
    "this conclusion is , however , not so important because the branch bc can not be reached as a result of conventional cosmological evolution in the classical picture .",
    "more interesting situation is realized for @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ pos ] ) . equation ( [ dyn ] ) with `` @xmath54 '' sign again has stationary points on the cd branch , and that with `` @xmath53 '' sign has it on the ac branch .",
    "if @xmath106 , points on the ab branch are stable , and those on the bc branch are unstable ; for @xmath133 , the situation is opposite .",
    "however , now classical and quantum dynamics differs significantly . in the classical picture",
    ", the bc branch is part of the evolution track of the brane2 , and it can be reached during a cosmological evolution from some high - energy initial phase .",
    "the effects of vacuum polarization make this branch unreachable for a braneworld with @xmath106 .",
    "these results can be interpreted from a different point of view .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the evolution of a brane should be close to the classical picture in regions which are far removed from singularities .",
    "that is why we are interested only in the case @xmath106 .",
    "what is the fate of a braneworld if we take quantum corrections into account ?",
    "in general , this problem requires numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ dyn ] ) ; however , we can make several qualitative statements .",
    "[ neg]b contains only stable branches , so the dynamics with quantum corrections is qualitatively the same , with recollapse somewhere in the neighbourhood of the points b and d. in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ neg]a , the brane1 evolution de does not change much and results in a recollapse .",
    "the brane2 branch ab in the classical picture meets a quiescent future singularity with @xmath4 finite and @xmath134 at the point b. such a singularity is absent in the quantum picture because the expression under the square root in ( [ dyn ] ) is positive if @xmath135 .",
    "numerical simulations show that the ultimate fate of the brane2 universe in the case with @xmath63 and with a large negative @xmath25 is also a recollapse .",
    "on the other hand , in the case @xmath64 , recollapse becomes impossible since the existence of a square root in ( [ dyn ] ) requires @xmath136 .",
    "this restriction is valid also for the classical equation ( [ main ] ) .",
    "however , during the classical evolution , a braneworld reaches the point c , where @xmath137 , with @xmath109 , and then enters the cb branch , which corresponds to super - exponential expansion @xmath138 but which is impossible in the quantum case .",
    "our numerical results show that , instead , the universe reaches some point with @xmath139 and @xmath83 .",
    "this causes the square root in ( [ dyn ] ) to vanish , which , in turn , leads to the divergence of @xmath5 , while @xmath140 remains finite . as a result , instead of a quiescent future singularity with @xmath141 at the point b ,",
    "the universe encounters a much weaker singularity with @xmath10 in the neighborhood of the point c. similarly , the brane2 universe misses the point b and falls into a singularity with @xmath10 .",
    "the preceding discussion focussed on a homogeneous and isotropic universe whose expansion was governed by the brane equations of motion . since the real universe is quite inhomogeneous on spatial scales @xmath142  mpc , it is worthwhile to ask whether any of our previous results may be generalized to this case .",
    "although we are not yet able to provide a self - consistent treatment of the brane equations for this important case , still , some aspects of the problem can be discussed at the phenomenological level .",
    "consider , for instance , the expansion law ( [ solution ] ) @xmath143 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { \\lambda_\\b \\over 6 } + { 1 \\over \\ell^2 } \\left [ \\sqrt { 1 + \\ell^2 \\left({\\rho + \\sigma \\over 3 m^2 } - { \\lambda_\\b \\over 6 } \\right ) } \\pm 1 \\right]^2 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a necessary condition for the existence of a quiescent singularity is that the matter density @xmath40 drop to a value which is small enough for the square root on the right - hand side of ( [ cosmo ] ) to vanish .",
    "when this happens , the universe encounters the quiescent singularity at which @xmath40 and @xmath4 remain finite , but @xmath144 and higher derivatives of the scale factor diverge .",
    "note , however , that , according to ( [ cosmo ] ) , the universe encounters the quiescent singularity _ homogeneously _ , , every part of the ( spatially infinite ) universe encounters the singularity at _ one and the same _ instant of time .",
    "this follows from the fact that the density in ( [ cosmo ] ) depends only upon the cosmic time and upon nothing else . in practice , however , the universe is anything but homogeneous , its density varying from place to place .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the density of matter in galaxies is @xmath145 times the average value while , in voids , it drops to only a small fraction of the average value .",
    "this immediately suggests that the brane should encounter the quiescent singularity in a very inhomogeneous fashion .",
    "underdense regions ( voids ) will be the first to encounter the singularity . even in this case , since the density in individual voids is inhomogeneously distributed , more underdense regions lying closer to the void center will be the first to experience the singularity .",
    "it therefore follows that the quiescent singularity will first form near the centers of very underdense regions .",
    "as the void expands , its density at larger radii will drop below @xmath146 , where @xmath147 consequently , the singularity will propagate outward from the void center in the form of a quasi - spherical singular front .",
    "( for simplicity , we have assumed that all voids have a spherical density profile ; this assumption may need to be modified for more realistic cases ; see @xcite and references therein . )    the above approach provides us with a very different perspective of the quiescent singularity than that adopted in the previous sections ( and in @xcite ) .",
    "for one thing , the singularity may be present in certain regions of the universe _ right now _",
    ", so it concerns us directly ( as astrophysicists ) and not as some abstract point to which we may ( or may not ) evolve in the distant future .",
    "the second issue is related to the first , since the singularity could already exist within several voids ( there are as many as a million voids in the visible universe in at least some of which the condition @xmath148 could be satisfied ) , a practical observational strategy needs to be adopted to search for singularities in voids .",
    "( similar strategies combined with strenuous observational efforts have led to the discovery of dozens of black holes in the centers of galaxies @xcite . )",
    "a number of important issues therefore need to be addressed :    1 .   since @xmath3 within a finite region at the very center of a void",
    ", it follows that , unless this region is contained within an event horizon , we will find ourselves staring at a naked singularity ! ( as shown earlier , quantum effects do soften the singularity so that @xmath149 may remain finite if these effects are included . ) 2 .   in the discussion in sec .",
    "[ quantum ] , the issue of particle production was ignored since it was assumed that we were dealing with conformally coupled fields which are not created quantum mechanically in the ( conformally flat ) homogeneous and isotropic universe which we have been considering up to now . however , the moment we drop the homogeneity assumption , the issue of particle production immediately crops up , and we must take it into account if our treatment is to be at all complete @xcite .",
    "( in a related context , the quantum creation of gravitons takes place even in a homogeneous and isotropic universe , since these fields couple minimally , and not conformally , to gravity @xcite . )",
    "let us discuss the possible effect of particle production in more detail .",
    "first , we consider the model of homogeneous universe taking it as an approximation to the situation inside an underdensity region ( void ) .",
    "gravitational quantum particle production occurs as the singularity is approached . since the local value of the hubble parameter remains finite at the singularity , production of the conformally coupled particles ( like photons )",
    "is expected to be negligible .",
    "however , particles that are non - conformally coupled to gravity ( which could be , for example , higgs bosons in the standard model ) will be copiously produced as the acceleration of the universe @xmath150 rapidly increases .",
    "the rate of particle production depends not only on their coupling to gravity but also on their coupling between themselves .",
    "gravitationally created primary particles will decay into conformally coupled secondaries ( electrons , photons , neutrino , etc . ) , which will influence the rate of production of the primaries by causing decoherence in their quantum state .",
    "the whole process is thus not easy to calculate in detail .",
    "however , from very general arguments it can be seen that creation of matter due to quantum particle production is important for the dynamics of the universe during its later stages .    for the sake of physical simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the case of vanishing bulk cosmological constant @xmath151 and write eq .",
    "( [ cosmo ] ) in the form @xmath152 where @xmath153 and where we have chosen the physically interesting `` @xmath53 '' sign in eq .",
    "( [ cosmo ] ) .",
    "thus , we have two free parameters in our theory , namely , @xmath44 and @xmath146 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is assumed to be of the order of the planck mass . in this case",
    "the early - time behaviour of the universe follows the standard friedmann model , as can be seen from ( [ cosmo ] ) or ( [ cosmo1 ] ) .",
    "let the average particle energy density production rate be @xmath154 .",
    "then , differentiating eq .",
    "( [ cosmo1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath155 where @xmath156 corresponds to the effective equation of state of matter in the universe : if @xmath157 , then @xmath158 .",
    "the second term in the numerator of ( [ rate ] ) follows from the conservation law and describes the effect of the universe expansion on the matter density .",
    "( note that @xmath40 includes contributions from quantum and classical matter . )    in order to qualitatively assess the effects of particle production , let us examine two fundamentally distinct possibilities .    1 .",
    "suppose that , in the course of evolution , @xmath159 is reached in a finite interval of time .",
    "since the hubble parameter is a unique function of the energy density , given by ( [ cosmo1 ] ) , and since the singularity value @xmath146 of the energy density is approached from above , it follows that @xmath160 in the neighbourhood of the singular point . in the purely classical case",
    "we find , after setting @xmath161 to zero in ( [ rate ] ) , that @xmath162 as the quiescent singularity is approached .",
    "it is well known , however , that particle production effects are sensitive to the change in the rate of expansion @xcite , and it is expected that @xmath163 will go to infinity as @xmath162 . since @xmath164 , this will result in @xmath165 becoming positive , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath166 . + therefore",
    ", under the assumption that the critical density @xmath146 is reached in a finite time , the only possibility for @xmath165 is to _",
    "remain bounded_. in other words , the rate of particle production should exactly balance the decrease in the matter density due to expansion , turning the numerator in ( [ rate ] ) to zero : + @xmath167 + in this case , the universe reaches its singular state with the energy density due to particle production exactly balancing the density decrease caused by expansion , as given by ( [ prodrate ] ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the above regime will be realized or whether , if realized , it will be stable , since it requires the exact balancing of rates ( [ prodrate ] ) at the singularity .",
    "a second distinct possibility is that , due to the presence of particle production , the value of @xmath168 always remains bounded from below by a nonzero density . in this scenario",
    ", @xmath165 initially decreases ( @xmath169 increases ) under the influence of the increasing factor @xmath170 in ( [ rate ] ) .",
    "however , a large value of @xmath169 induces active particle production from the vacuum which leads to an increase in the value of @xmath163 in ( [ rate ] ) .",
    "as the value of @xmath171 reaches its ( nonzero ) minimum , we have @xmath172 at this point , according to ( [ cosmo1 ] ) , after which the rate @xmath165 becomes positive due to self - sustained particle production that continues because of the large value of the second time derivative @xmath140 .",
    "after a period of extensive particle production , the universe reaches another turning point @xmath172 after which is continues to expand according to ( [ cosmo1 ] ) with decreasing energy density .",
    "thus , we arrive at a model of cyclic evolution with periods of extensive particle production alternating with periods of classical expansion during which quantum particle production is negligible .",
    "this scenario bears a formal resemblance to quasi - steady - state cosmology proposed in a very different context by hoyle , burbidge , and narlikar @xcite .",
    "the particle production rate in our case is estimated by the quantity @xmath161 given in ( [ prodrate ] ) , which is approximately the value it takes at the turning points where @xmath172 .",
    "the hubble parameter in this scenario periodically varies being of the order of @xmath173 , and the energy density is of the order @xmath146 , so that particle production rate is @xmath174    our discussion thus far was limited to quantum processes within a single underdense region ( void ) which was assumed for simplicity to be perfectly homogeneous .",
    "let us now ( qualitatively ) discuss whether this scenario can be generalized to the real ( inhomogeneous ) universe .",
    "clearly , the particle production rate @xmath161 in this case should be regarded as being averaged over the entire universe , to which several significantly underdense voids are contributing .",
    "equation ( [ rate ] ) should therefore be treated as an ensemble average , where the _ mean _ particle production rate depends upon the distribution as well as dynamics of _ local _ underdensity regions . as a result , equation ( [ rate ] ) is not expected to explicitly depend upon the behaviour of the hubble parameter and , in principle , particle production can proceed even in a de  sitter - like universe , in which the hubble parameter @xmath4 remains constant in time .",
    "the rate of particle production in this case is given by equality ( [ rate ] ) with zero left - hand side : @xmath175    the value of the hubble parameter in such a steady - state universe can be related to the @xmath176-parameter in matter @xmath177 where we have used the basic eq .",
    "( [ cosmo1 ] ) . for the average energy density",
    ", we obviously have @xmath178 .",
    "hence , @xmath179 or , finally , . ]",
    "@xmath180    in principle , one might use these preliminary results to construct a braneworld version of steady - state cosmology , in which matter is being created at a steady rate in voids rather than in overdense regions ( as hypothesized in the original version @xcite ) .",
    "this would then add one more model to the steadily growing list of dark - energy cosmologies @xcite .",
    "these conclusions must , however , be substantiated by a more detailed treatment which takes into account the _ joint _ effect of vacuum polarization and particle production near the quiescent singularity . clearly , whether one or the other effect dominates will depend upon the number of conformal and non - conformal fields contributing to the vacuum , their spin weights , etc .",
    "we propose to return to this issue in a future work .",
    "cosmological models based on braneworld gravity have the interesting property of giving rise to singularities which are not commonly encountered in general relativity .",
    "this is largely due to the possibility of different kinds of embedding of the brane in the higher dimensional ( bulk ) space - time .",
    "singular embedding implies that the expansion ( in time ) of the brane can not be continued indefinitely .",
    "the singularities which we have examined in this paper arise because of this reason .",
    "they have the property that , while the density , pressure , and hubble parameter on the brane remain finite , higher derivatives of the hubble parameter blow up as the singularity is approached .",
    "for this reason , we refer to these singularities as being `` quiescent . '' despite its deceptively mild nature , the quiescent singularity is a real curvature singularity at which the kretschmann invariant diverges ( @xmath181 )",
    ". the importance of quantum effects in regions of large space - time curvature has been demonstrated in a number of papers @xcite , and it should therefore come as no surprise that these effects can significantly alter the classical behaviour near the quiescent singularity , as demonstrated by us in this paper . examining the vacuum polarization caused by massless conformally coupled fields ,",
    "we find that these weaken the quiescent singularity resulting in an exceedingly mild ( soft ) singularity at which the values of @xmath4 , @xmath182 , and @xmath1 remain finite while @xmath5 and higher derivatives of the hubble parameter diverge .    unlike the classical big - bang singularity",
    ", the quiescent singularity in braneworld models is reached in regions of _ low density _ and is therefore encountered during the course of the universe expansion rather than its collapse .",
    "densities lower than the mean value are known to occupy a large filling fraction within the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the braneworld model is a true representation of reality , one might speculate that it is likely to encounter the quiescent singularity ( or its quantum - corrected counterpart , the `` soft singularity '' ) within large underdense regions , or voids .",
    "the rapidly varying space - time geometry near the quiescent singularity can , in addition to vacuum polarization , also give rise to quantum creation of fields which do not couple conformally to gravity .",
    "( examples include massive ( leptons , higgs , etc . ) as well as massless ( gravitons ) particles . )",
    "a preliminary estimate made by us in this paper shows that , if this process is sufficiently intensive , then the universe will expand at late times in a manner which is reminiscent of quasi - steady - state cosmology , with the hubble parameter showing oscillations about a constant value . a more detailed estimate of particle production , however , lies beyond the scope of the present paper , and we hope to return to it in a future work .",
