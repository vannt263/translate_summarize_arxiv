    "ultrafast semiconductor spectroscopy provides a unique laboratory for the investigation of coherence and scattering effects in solids :  @xcite a short laser pulse creates electron - hole pairs propagating in phase with the exciting laser ; this initial phase coherence is consecutively destroyed through mutual interactions among the photoexcited carriers and couplings to environmental degrees of freedom , e.g. phonons , thus leading to _ decoherence _ ,",
    "@xcite which can be monitored again by means of ultrafast spectroscopy .",
    "recent years have seen spectacular examples of such ultrafast semiconductor spectroscopy , e.g. the observation of phonon quantum beats  @xcite or the buildup of screening ,  @xcite and have revealed dephasing and relaxation times of the order of femto- and picoseconds for carrier - carrier and carrier - phonon interactions , respectively .    in semiconductor quantum dots",
    ",  @xcite sometimes referred to as _ artificial atoms _ , the strong confinement in all three spatial directions results in a substantial suppression of decoherence as compared to higher - dimensional semiconductors , i.e. , bulk , quantum - wells , or quantum wires .",
    "on the one hand , coulomb interactions among carriers captured in the dot do not result in scattering but only give rise to energy renormalizations of the electron - hole few - particle states .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , at low temperatures phonon - mediated dephasing of the electron - hole states of lowest energy is of only minor importance ,  @xcite and can become even negligible in comparison to spontaneous emission of photons which occurs on a nanosecond time scale .",
    "@xcite these remarkable features render quantum dots ideal candidates for the solid - state implementation of quantum engineering ,  @xcite e.g. , for the purpose of quantum computation , which has led to considerable research activities in recent years .",
    "@xcite    observation of optical coherence effects in ensembles of dots is usually spoiled by inhomogeneous line broadening due to dot size fluctuations , with typical broadenings comparable to the level splittings themselves . to overcome this problem , within the last couple of years a number of experimental techniques were developed to allow the observation of single quantum dots , hereby establishing the rapidly growing field of _ single - dot spectroscopy_.  @xcite such single - dot measurements are not only indispensable for the observation of quantum coherence and the implementation of quantum engineering , but also open the possibility to study decoherence and relaxation in _ single _ quantum systems .",
    "the theoretical analysis of single quantum system , however , is more cumbersome as compared to ensembles of corresponding systems . in the latter case ,",
    "one usually employs the framework of quantum transport theory or quantum kinetics  @xcite which describes the time evolution of macroscopic quantities , e.g. , the interband polarization , directly accessible to experiment ; here , the detailed evolution of one specific subsystem is completely irrelevant , which allows to submit the problem to the laws of statistical physics .",
    "on the other hand , for a single system one has to be more specific about the occurrence of single scatterings and their monitoring through a measurement apparatus .",
    "the question of how to theoretically describe such problems first arose almost two decades ago when it became possible to store single ions in a paul trap and to continuously monitor their resonance fluorescence , and led to the development of the celebrated _ quantum - jump approach_.  @xcite this approach combines the usual master - equation approach with the rules of demolition quantum measurements ,  @xcite and provides a flexible tool for the description of single - system dynamics subject to continuous monitoring .    in this paper",
    "we employ the quantum - jump approach to two representative examples for the observation of single scatterings in single semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "first , we study the cascade decay of a biexciton , which has recently attracted considerable interest :  @xcite in a first step , the biexciton decays through emission of a photon to the spin - degenerate exciton states ; this final - state ambiguity leads to an _ entanglement _ of photon and exciton ; when subsequently the exciton decays , the photon - exciton entanglement is transferred to a two - photon entanglement .",
    "@xcite as shown below , for dots with an exciton fine - structure splitting  @xcite the two - photon correlation function of this cascade decay exhibits an oscillatory behavior , provided that the photons are detected in a properly chosen polarization basis ( see ref .   for a similar experiment ) .",
    "our analysis carefully examines the photon emission processes , and improves upon the simple - minded framework of fermi s golden rule to provide a proper description of the problem under concern .",
    "our second example is based on an experiment recently performed by zrenner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in which the authors used a quantum dot embedded in a field - effect structure to transform an optically excited exciton through tunneling into a photocurrent . here , we study the decay of a charged exciton , i.e. , of a coulomb - renormalized complex consisting of two electrons and a hole .",
    "@xcite through the tunneling process one electron with either spin - up or spin - down orientation is transferred from the dot to the reservoir ; since the electron in the dot has an opposite spin orientation , the spins of the reservoir- and dot - electron become entangled .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the optical biexciton decay additional difficulties arise because the tunnel - generated electron and hole do not propagate freely , as photons would in the corresponding scheme , but are subject to interactions in the contact .",
    "we develop a prototypical , though simplified , description scheme of the scattering channels in the reservoir , and demonstrate that this spin entanglement is robust against spin - unselective scatterings and is only deteriorated by spin - selective scatterings .",
    "we have organized our paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two.photon ] we discuss the monitored biexciton cascade decay in a single quantum dot .",
    "we specify our model system , provide a short discussion of the master - equation and quantum - jump approach , and finally show how to obtain the system s time evolution through unraveling of the master equation .",

    "@xcite within this scheme , the hamiltonian of the quantum - dot states reads :    @xmath13    where energy zero is given by the groundstate . in what follows",
    ", we shall make use of the fact that the groundstate is optically connected to the biexciton state @xmath5 through two independent pathways , namely 013 and 023 , which allows to establish a _ quantum coherence _ between the single - exciton states directly observable in optical experiments .    because of the important role of states @xmath4 we shall find it convenient to introduce the pauli matrices @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which together with the unit matrix @xmath17 form a complete basis within the single - exciton subspace .",

    "hence , a laser pulse propagating in @xmath8-direction with polarization along @xmath6 or @xmath7 allows to selectively excite one of the two single - exciton eigenstates . on the other hand ,",
    "any other light polarization will induce a superposition state , e.g. ,    @xmath19    for circular polarization @xmath20 .",
    "further below we shall find it convenient to switch between the linear basis @xmath4 and the circular one , eq .",

    "thus , if the system is initially prepared in , e.g. , state @xmath24 ( which is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ) , it will start to oscillate between @xmath25 where the oscillation period is given by @xmath26 .",
    "we describe the light - matter coupling within the usual dipole and rotating - wave approximations  @xcite    @xmath27    here , @xmath28 is the electric field of the light evolving with positive or negative frequency components ,  @xcite    @xmath29    the _ interband polarization _ of the quantum dot , @xmath11 the dipole moment , @xmath30 a unit vector along @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and @xmath31 denotes the state with polarization perpendicular to @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that the quantum dot initially in its groundstate is excited by a short laser pulse .",
    "we assume that @xmath28 is sufficiently intense to be treated classically , and that the spectral width of the pulse is sufficiently broad to excite both 0@xmath2 transitions with comparable strength but narrow enough to inhibit transitions between @xmath2 and 3 .",
    "then , such a pulse with circular polarization @xmath32 will induce a superposition @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are determined by the laser parameters .",
    "since @xmath24 is not an eigenstate but a _ coherent superposition _ of states @xmath4 , as time goes on the system will oscillate between @xmath36 .",
    "this optically induced quantum coherence corresponds to an oscillating interband polarization which can be directly monitored by a second , time - delayed laser pulse ( see , e.g. , refs .   for the observation of such _ coherence beats _ ) .",
    "let us assume that the frequency of the second pulse is tuned to the @xmath23 transitions and that the delay time is short as compared to the decoherence times .",
    "then , the absorption of the second pulse will sensitively depend on the time delay between the two pulses , and will exhibit oscillations on a time scale of @xmath26 .",
    "in this paper we shall address the question whether it is possible to observe a similar effect by means of incoherent optics .",
    "we assume that initially the dot is in the biexciton state  @xcite and consider the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : biexciton]a , where the optical decay of photons along @xmath37 is monitored by two photo detectors . for",

    "thus , time - resolved photon correlation measurements together with appropriate frequency and polarization filtering should provide a means for the measurement of quantum coherence in an incoherent optical experiment .    at this point",
    "we encounter a conceptual problem .",

    ", the photon correlations would strongly depend on the choice of the basis @xmath42 : in the circular basis , the detection of a @xmath40 photon would correspond to an optical decay from 3 to @xmath24 and would result in the aforementioned coherence beats . on the other hand , in the linear basis the detection of a @xmath40 photon had to be associated with equal probability to either the 31 or 32 decay , and",
    "the state after photoemission would be a mixture _ without any quantum coherence between @xmath4 _ ( since the nature of a scattering is intrinsically incoherent ) .",
    "here is the problem : within the framework of fermi s golden rule different predictions arise for different basis sets .",
    "this is a very unfortunate situation which calls for a more careful theoretical analysis .",
    "it is the purpose of the remainder of this section to reexamine the problem of photon correlation measurements from the biexciton decay and to provide a comprehensible answer .",

    "( [ eq : lindblad.disentangle ] ) , the density operator after disentanglement still exhibits a classical correlation where the spins of the electrons in the reservoir and dot are antiparallel ; apparently , it would require additional spin - flip processes to completely decouple the two electrons .",
    "see also ref .   for a discussion of how such spin entanglement could be measured experimentally and possible quantum information applications .       of eq .",
    "( [ eq : unraveling ] ) as discussed in the text .",
    "times are measured in units of the inverse tunneling rate @xmath151 ; we assume @xmath152 for the spin - unselective and @xmath153 for the spin - selective scatterings .",
    "the black dashed line shows the sum of @xmath154 and @xmath155 which corresponds to the degree of spin entanglement . ]",
    "we finally list in table  [ table : entangler ] the various contributions of the cascade decay to the density operator , i.e. , corresponding to the step before tunneling , after tunneling , after dephasing , and after disentanglement .",
    "the probabilities for the corresponding contributions are determined by our unraveling procedure and can be obtained as follows : initially , the system is in the charged - exciton state , i.e. , @xmath156 ; because of tunneling @xmath157 decays mono - exponentially ; correspondingly , the increase of the contribution after tunneling @xmath158 is proportional to the decrease of @xmath157 , which again diminishes because of dephasing , and so forth . within this scheme ,",
    "we can easily obtain the time evolution of the various probabilities as shown in the last column of table  [ table : entangler ] , with the initial conditions @xmath156 and @xmath159 for @xmath160 . fig .",
    "[ fig : entanglement ] sketches the various contributions for representative values of @xmath138 and @xmath149 .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed single scatterings in single semiconductor quantum dots for two representative examples .",
    "first , for the cascade decay of a biexciton it has been shown that an exciton fine - structure splitting results for appropriately chosen polarization filters in an oscillatory behavior of the two - photon correlations . in our second example we have investigated the tunneling decay of a charged exciton inside a field - effect structure into a photo current , and have shown that the spins of the electrons in the dot and reservoir become entangled . we have discussed that this entanglement is robust against dephasing and spin - unselective scatterings , and thus benefits from the long spin lifetimes in semiconductors .",
    "our theoretical approach has been based on a master - equation approach in lindblad form in conjunction with the quantum - jump approach for the description of photon measurements .",
    "we have seen that the description scheme in terms of lindblad operators , suitable for the environment couplings of our present concern , is superior over related quantum - transport descriptions based on the markov and adiabatic approximations .",
    "@xcite first , no assumption about the final states of a ` scattering ' has to be invoked , and it suffices to assume a sufficiently short - lived memory kernel of the reservoirs instead .",
    "secondly , lindblad operators associated to measurement , e.g. , photon detection , allow for the application of the quantum - jump approach and provide a means to describe single - system dynamics .",
    "finally , the distinction of out- and in - scatterings in the master - equation makes possible a flexible solution scheme through unraveling , which appears to be highly elegant in particular for the cascade processes discussed in this work .",
    "we expect our findings to be useful for the analysis of time - resolved single - system measurements and for the simulation of quantum - information applications .",

    "in this appendix we show how to evaluate contributions of the form @xmath161 .",
    "first , the polarization vector of a photon with wavevector @xmath43 and polarization @xmath44 can be expressed as  @xcite    @xmath162    the integral over the angular - dependent part can be evaluated to    @xmath163    i.e. , only terms with @xmath164 give a nonzero contribution .",
    "finally ,    @xmath165    is the wigner - weisskopf decay rate for a dipole radiator embedded in a medium with refractive index @xmath136 .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the master equation of a generic two - level system .",
    "since the pauli matrices @xmath166 together with the unit matrix @xmath167 form a complete basis , we can expand the density operator as      with the vector @xmath169 .",
    "from @xmath170 we find @xmath171 and @xmath172 implies that @xmath173 is real .",
    "analogously , a generic lindblad operator is of the form @xmath174 , where @xmath175 and @xmath176 can be decomposed into real and imaginary parts .",
    "the master equation corresponding to this lindblad operator is of the form          then , for the lindblad operator @xmath179 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lindblad.disentangle ] ) for disentanglement we find @xmath180 and @xmath181 , which can be easily solved to arrive at the final result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : disentangled ] ) .",
    "such selective biexciton population could be achieved similar to quantum - dot based single - photon experiments :  @xcite first , a short laser pulse creates electron - hole pairs in continuum states in the vicinity of the quantum dot ; carrier capture results in a multi - exciton complex within the dot , which decays through successive emission of photons ; because of environment coupling , after each photon emission the system quickly relaxes to the electron - hole state of lowest energy . in what follows , it is sufficient to assume that during this cascade process the dot will eventually pass through state @xmath5 .",
    "such selective charged - exciton occupation can be achieved as follows .",
    "suppose that initially the spin direction of the doping electron is undetermined , i.e. , the corresponding density operator is a mixture @xmath182 .",
    "when at time @xmath183 the dot is subject to an unpolarized optical @xmath184-pulse  @xcite the system will be excited in accordance to our assumption to state @xmath127 ."
