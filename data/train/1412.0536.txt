    "the non - trivial structure of the qcd vacuum attracted much attention in light of recent heavy - ion experiments performed at rhic and lhc .",
    "these experiments make it possible to study the strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) in hadronic scale magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial gluonic configurations may induce an imbalance between densities of left- and right - handed light quarks ( chirality ) . as a strong magnetic field",
    "is applied to the system , the imbalance can give rise to a net electric current in sqgp along the magnetic field ( chiral magnetic effect @xcite ) .",
    "so far it was difficult to build a first - principles theory , describing this and similar effects , since the physics of sqgp is essentially nonperturbative .",
    "however , there is a need in such a theory , because constant axial chemical potentials , introduced by hand , break unitarity @xcite and lead to various consistency and stability problems @xcite . at the same time , without the knowledge of all possible anomalous effects of a similar kind , one will face difficulties in the experimental searches for each of them .",
    "fortunately , it seems that such a theory can be established ( and it is sketched below ) , because qcd contains a long - wave axion - like degree of freedom , which can play a role of carrier for the chirality .",
    "indeed , one can consider qcd coupled to qed with an auxiliary gauged @xmath0 , and bosonize quarks with dirac eigenvalues smaller than some fixed scale @xmath1 . since there is no gauge @xmath0 in nature",
    ", one can choose a pure gauge form of the external axial vector field and , as a result of the procedure , one obtains the following effective euclidean lagrangian @xcite , @xmath2 where the axion - like field @xmath3 originates from the fermionic ir modes , while source currents can be formed by the uv modes .",
    "the physical value for the cut - off @xmath1 is different in different regimes and can be found from the dependence of the chirality on the axial chemical potential @xcite : @xmath4 at high temperatures ; @xmath5 at strong magnetic fields ; @xmath6 at small temperatures and weak ( or absent ) magnetic fields .",
    "the @xmath3-field can be deduced from qcd even without mentioning its microscopic origins , see @xcite for a non - dynamical case , where @xmath7 was introduced formally as a source of the topological charge density density and generates similar currents .",
    "one more interesting case , when anomalous effects are reproduced , is an axionic field , coupled to the topological charge density , but propagating in a bulk of a holographic model @xcite . as a last remark ,",
    "it is important that the @xmath3-field is _ not _ a ghost , which can be seen from the sign of its kinetic term in ( [ lagrangian ] ) and from the analysis of ref .",
    "chiral superfluidity is a hydrodynamic model of the sqgp in the range of temperatures @xmath8 derived from the effective lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the essential idea of the model is to consider the sqgp as a two - component fluid with two independent motions : a curl - free motion of the near - zero quark modes ( the `` superfluid '' component ) ; and the thermalized medium of dressed quarks ( the `` normal '' component ) .",
    "the first one is described by a pseudo - scalar field @xmath3 , while the second one is represented by a four - velocity @xmath9 .",
    "hydrodynamic equations can be written in the following way @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the axial anomaly coefficient , e.g. @xmath12 and the `` axion decay constant '' @xmath13 .",
    "the constitutive relations can be written in the gradient expansion , @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the energy - momentum tensor of the liquid ( total energy - momentum tensor minus the ones of free vector fields ) , @xmath16 is the total electric current , @xmath17 is the axial current .",
    "the listed equations are similar to the ones of a relativistic superfluid @xcite , suggesting the name `` chiral superfluid '' for our model .",
    "( [ josephson ] ) is the josephson equation .",
    "one should , of course , distinguish our situation from the conventional superfluidity as , first , there is no spontaneously broken symmetry and , second , the normal component is axially neutral .",
    "dissipative corrections @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are due to finite viscosity , electric resistivity , etc .",
    ", and do not contain terms proportional to the chiral anomaly coefficient @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "additional electric current @xmath21 is induced by the `` superfluid '' component and can be represented by a sum of three terms @xmath22 where the electric and magnetic fields in the `` normal component '' rest frame are defined as @xmath23    the first term in ( [ phenom ] ) corresponds to the chiral magnetic effect @xcite , i.e. generation of an electric current along the external magnetic field .",
    "the second one is the chiral electric effect @xcite  generation of the current transverse to the electric field .",
    "the third term we call the chiral dipole effect , which is a generation of electric charge on the inhomogeneities of @xmath3 field .",
    "if the profile of @xmath3 is a solitary wave , then this effect will induce a dipole moment on it .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the field @xmath3 itself is a 4d generalization of the chiral magnetic wave @xcite ) . in the presence of a strong magnetic field , in becomes",
    "exactly the one described in @xcite , because all higher order terms in ( [ lagrangian ] ) disappear in the @xmath24 limit , making the bosonization procedure exact , which is a manifestation of the dimensional reduction of the quark dynamics to 2d .",
    "finally , let us consider an effect of rotation on the chiral superfluid",
    ". the idea will be similar to the one considered in ref .",
    "vorticity ( a measure of rotation ) of the superfluid component is defined on the superfluid velocity , @xmath25 , via @xmath26 in derivation of the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath3 field was assumed to be smooth . in this case",
    "the superfluid component is irrotational , because of the contraction of the levi - civita symbol with two derivatives in ( [ vorticity ] ) .",
    "however , in the presence of rotation , the superfluid component can acquire a nonzero total vorticity through the development of singularities , similar to axionic strings @xcite , @xmath27\\theta=2\\pi \\delta^{(2)}(\\vec{x}_\\perp ) , \\label{eq : defect}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are in the plane perpendicular to the vortex line ( string ) .",
    "this form of singularity quantizes the vorticity as @xmath30 per vortex . ) would not change the final result . ]",
    "the presence of the delta - function in ( [ eq : defect ] ) creates problems , as , e.g. , validity of the derivative expansion . following an elaborated study @xcite ,",
    "we resolve them by introducing a smoothing function @xmath31 , @xmath32 which modifies the chern - simons part of the effective action ( [ lagrangian ] ) , @xmath33 this takes into account the near - string microscopic physics and introduces a core of the string with a finite thickness .",
    "we do not need the exact profile of @xmath34 for our studies .",
    "varying the effective action with respect to @xmath35 we obtain the electric current @xmath36 where @xmath37 should be understood as a smoothed delta - function , see @xcite . here",
    "the first term is identical to ( [ phenom ] ) away from the string .",
    "the second term is a new current along the string .",
    "let us consider a particular case of rotation around @xmath38 axis and the presence of ( ordinary ) chemical potential @xmath39 , which can be introduced via @xmath40 .",
    "the current can be rewritten then as @xmath41 which is the chiral vortical effect in our superfluid , compare to other hydrodynamic results , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "introduction of @xmath42 separates nicely the bulk currents from the string currents .",
    "finally , the electric field parallel to the vortex line , if present , will break the gauge - invariance on the string , @xmath43 but not in the full theory due to the induced anomaly inflow , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "physically , the electric field will induce bulk electric currents , going radially toward the vortex lines , and then flowing into and along them .",
    "so far we are not able to describe precisely the microscopic structure of the collective field @xmath3 .",
    "however , the fact that it may consist of the zero or near - zero fermionic modes can be deduced from various recent studies . by considering probe quarks",
    "one can show that the fermionic spectrum at the intermediate temperatures in interest ( @xmath8 ) consists of near - zero modes and the bulk of the spectrum , separated from the former by a gap ( see @xcite and refs . therein for early and quenched studies , as well as @xcite for the most recent results with dynamical fermions ) .",
    "this situation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "a near - zero peak in the second figure was expected since long ago from the interacting instanton liquid model @xcite .",
    "a long - wavelength mode slightly above @xmath44 was also obtained in a different way in ref .",
    "this gives us more hints supporting the two - component model .    regarding the space- and time - dependent picture",
    ", one of the possibilities might be the long - distance propagation of light quarks along the low - dimensional extended structures , populating the qcd vacuum ( see , e.g. @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) , if the structures exist beyond the probe quark limit .",
    "another study @xcite shows that , in the copenhagen ( `` spaghetti '' ) model of the qcd vacuum , the fermionic zero modes are localized on the chromodynamic flux tubes and propagate along them in a direction specified by their chirality .",
    "this may give us a clue of the collective behavior of the quark zero modes .",
