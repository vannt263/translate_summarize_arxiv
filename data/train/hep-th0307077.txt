    "although the idea that the universe could have experienced a bounce in its remote past is old  @xcite , it has recently come under new scrutiny  @xcite with the advent of string motivated scenarios of the pre big bang kind  @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this renewed interest is the fact that the most popular extensions of the standard model of high energy physics , such as string or m theory , when applied to cosmology , _ i.e.  _ in a four dimensional time dependent background , can lead to solutions with bouncing scale factors ( see , _",
    "e.g.  _ refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    a crucial property to decide whether these new models can be turned into realistic alternatives to the inflationary paradigm which",
    ", so far , has been so successful is the behavior of cosmological perturbations around these bouncing backgrounds . in particular ,",
    "an important test is to calculate the evolution of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations through the bounce in order to see whether it can be made close to scale invariance , _",
    "i.e.  _ if there is any possibility , given the prebounce era , to get a harrison - zeldovich power spectrum .    from a technical point of view",
    ", the previous question is a nontrivial problem .",
    "simple models , based on general relativity with flat spatial sections  @xcite , lead to the existence of a curvature singularity at the bounce itself and therefore do not seem to represent viable physical models .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to understand how meaningful a perturbative scheme around a singular solution would be ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so we shall assume that the question of the calculation of the cosmological perturbations can not be addressed in this way ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detailed discussions ) .",
    "in fact , it is believed that , in the vicinity of the bounce , string corrections become important  @xcite . typically , these corrections add to the gravity sector terms such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the riemann tensor and @xmath3 the curvature scalar  @xcite , and higher order terms in the curvature .",
    "the effect of these terms is , except in some specific instances  @xcite , to smooth out the singularity  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; this is , from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected .",
    "unfortunately , one can show that the process of adding up more and more high curvature corrections does not lead to convergence towards a single solution , _",
    "i.e.  _ this solution explicitly depends on the choice of the stringy corrections  @xcite .",
    "this means that , at each order , the bouncing scale factor looks completely different from the scale factor obtained at the previous order . nevertheless , at a fixed order in the string corrections",
    ", one can in principle compute how the perturbations propagate through the bounce .",
    "the main disadvantage of the procedure is that it renders the computation extremely complicated and only numerical calculations are available to make the problem tractable .",
    "an important point to be noticed is that , as already mentioned above , most models assume that the spatial sections are flat all the time whereas , at the bounce , the curvature term is expected to play a crucial role .",
    "therefore , it seems that for a bouncing universe , one can not just throw away the curvature term because it does not play a significant role as it is the case for an inflationary universe .",
    "in fact , in that regard , the situation is the opposite of inflation : during the final stages of inflation , one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the three - curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes , whereas even though the curvature may be negligible either in the remote past or in the future of the bounce , it has almost certainly no reason to be so in general .",
    "a way out to the previous difficulties , which would permit to undertake a tractable analytical calculation of the power spectrum , is the following .",
    "far from the bounce , one usually considers the situation for which the curvature is small , even though the implementation of this particular point may not be in itself a trivial task . in this case",
    ", one can consider that , during the contracting and expanding phases , the spatial sections are essentially flat so that the well known results stemming from the theory of cosmological perturbations can be straightforwardly applied .",
    "then , the main question becomes the effect of the bounce itself on the pre - bounce power spectrum .",
    "technically , this problem can be formulated as follows  @xcite . before the bounce ,",
    "the perturbations are characterized by two modes , a dominant ( denoted by @xmath4 ) and a sub - dominant ( @xmath5 ) one . with @xmath6 representing the comoving wave number of a given fourier mode , we write the @xmath6 dependence of these modes as @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the same manner , after the bounce , one decomposes the perturbation as @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the effect of the bounce is then entirely encoded into the form of the transition matrix @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 the mode of interest is of course the dominant mode in the expanding phase , @xmath13 .",
    "this equation corresponds to a general `` @xmath6-mode mixing , '' _",
    "i.e.  _ the dominant mode after the bounce is a general linear combination of the dominant and sub - dominant modes before the bounce .-",
    "mode mixing '' in order to emphasize that this mode mixing is valid for a fixed fourier mode and should not be confused with the mode mixing coming from nonlinearities which involves modes with different wave numbers . ]    _ a priori _ , various different situations can occur : the dominant mode in the contracting phase could acquire a scale invariant spectrum which is not conveyed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase because it turns out that @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( `` @xmath6-mode inversion , '' the scale invariant piece is passed to the `` wrong mode '' in the expanding phase ) ; this is for instance what occurs if one applies the usual israel junction conditions , known to apply for other cosmological transitions , at the bounce point  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the dominant mode in the contracting phase be scale invariant but that this property is lost through the bounce due to a nontrivial @xmath6 dependence of the coefficient @xmath16 .",
    "note that the opposite situation may also occur , for which the spectrum is initially not scale invariant but is turned into it because of a nontrivial @xmath6 dependence of the transition matrix .",
    "in fact , the common view concerning these last possibilities is that , for scales of astrophysical interest today , the bounce , lasting a short time , is expected to have no noticeable effect on those large scales  @xcite .",
    "this is sometimes argued to come from general arguments such as `` causality , '' a point which is discussed thoroughly in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for instance , this is a basic assumption in the perturbation spectrum calculations in the pre big bang scenario  @xcite .",
    "technically , this means that the transfer matrix is assumed not to depend on @xmath6  @xcite . within this framework",
    ", the goal reduces to finding situations for which a scale invariant spectrum is produced in the contracting phase , and to ensure that this spectrum is passed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase , _",
    "i.e.  _ to insure that the matching conditions at the bounce do not imply a @xmath6-mode inversion",
    ".    the present article aims at examining whether the assumption that the transfer matrix is @xmath6-independent is generically valid or not . for this purpose",
    ", we need to specify a class of models where bouncing solutions are possible and which allows simple analytical treatment of the perturbations through the bounce .",
    "we choose general relativity , positive curvature spatial section ( see the remarks above ) , and describe the matter content by a scalar field ; a similar strategy was used in ref .",
    "we do not assume anything relative to what happens away from the bounce , and in particular one could envisage that there the curvature is negligible ; note that , as we show below , this implies the existence of a new phase .",
    "therefore our closed geometry bounce can be viewed as an example of a transition connecting the contraction phase to the expanding phase with flat spatial sections , as already considered in the literature .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the following section , we set the precise model and derive the basic equations both for the background and the perturbations .",
    "we then discuss how one can model a bounce in this framework and derive an explicit form for the potential of the scalar part of the classical perturbations ( bardeen potential ) whose properties we then examine in details .",
    "this leads us to the main calculation of this article , namely that of the transfer matrix of eq .",
    "( [ transt ] ) .",
    "we show that this matrix depends on @xmath6 in a nontrivial way provided that the null energy condition ( nec ) is very close to being violated at the bounce .",
    "this illustrates , by means of a specific example , that the general argument according to which the limited but nonvanishing bounce duration could not affect the spectrum of long ( _ i.e .",
    "_ longer that the duration itself ) wavelength modes , is incorrect .",
    "we conclude by discussing this result , also showing that in the case under consideration , the propagation of gravitational waves ( tensor modes ) is qualitatively different of that of scalar modes since the former are never affected by the bounce .",
    "we assume that the background model is given by a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath17\\ , .\\ ] ] in this equation , the constant parameter @xmath18 can always be rescaled such that @xmath19 and describes the curvature of the spatial sections .",
    "the time @xmath20 is the conformal time related to the cosmic time by @xmath21 .",
    "the matter is described by a homogeneous scalar field @xmath22 and the corresponding energy density and pressure respectively read @xmath23 a prime denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time .",
    "the function @xmath24 represents the potential of the scalar field .",
    "einstein equations relate the scale factor to the energy density and pressure of the scalar field according to @xmath25 where we have defined @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the planck mass .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is then given by @xmath30 from the above equation , we see that the function @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 .",
    "it is directly related to the equation of state parameter @xmath33 by the following relation @xmath34 .",
    "the function @xmath31 reduces to a constant for constant equation of state and is zero in the particular case of the de sitter manifold . at the bounce , the hubble parameter vanishes , @xmath35 , while @xmath36 , and therefore the only way to preserve the null energy condition",
    "@xmath37 is to have @xmath38 .",
    "this is why , in this article , we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e.  _ the spatial sections are 3-spheres .",
    "let us also notice that , being given a bouncing scale factor @xmath39 , it is sufficient to check that @xmath40 at all times in order for the scale factor to be a solution of the einstein equations with a single real scalar field .",
    "a universe with closed spatial sections is characterized by two fundamental lengths .",
    "the first length is the hubble length defined by @xmath41 ( a dot denoting a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath42 ) and the second one is the curvature radius , @xmath43 .",
    "the flat limit is recovered when @xmath44 as revealed by the equation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the ratio of the total energy density @xmath47 to the critical energy density .",
    "when it comes to numerical applications , let us recall that one can safely assume the preferred value  @xcite @xmath48  km@xmath49s@xmath50mpc@xmath51 with @xmath52 , leading to a hubble distance scale now of @xmath53  mpc  @xmath54  gpc .",
    "moreover , with @xmath55 , one has a curvature length , namely the scale factor as measured now  @xcite , of order @xmath56  gpc ( with @xmath57 ) , the limit coming from the maximum allowed value for @xmath58 at one @xmath59 level .    at the perturbed level , and in the presence of density perturbations only",

    "the eigenfunctions @xmath63 of the laplace - beltrami operator on the spatial sections satisfy the equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an integer .",
    "note at this point that it is because of our normalization with a dimensionful scale factor @xmath66 , and hence dimensionless coordinates @xmath67 , implying a dimensionless operator itself , that the eigenvalues of @xmath68 are dimensionless integer numbers ; with a different convention , _",
    "i.e.  _ with @xmath69 dimensionless , one would have @xmath70 = l^{-2}$ ] and an extra factor @xmath71 would appear in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) .",
    "the modes @xmath72 , corresponding to a homogeneous deformation , and @xmath73 , being nothing but a global motion of the center of the 3-sphere , are pure gauge modes  @xcite : we will accordingly consider only values of @xmath65 such that @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , for the relevant cosmological parameters discussed above , one finds that the values of @xmath65 corresponding to characteristic distance scales of cosmological interest now , namely @xmath75  mpc  @xmath76  mpc , range between @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the largest possible value of the total density now . for a reasonable value of @xmath79 , we find that @xmath65 is between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the scalar perturbations are described by the four functions , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 and , from them , it is possible to construct two gauge - invariant quantities , called the bardeen potentials , and defined by  @xcite @xmath86'\\ , , \\quad   \\psi \\equiv \\psi -\\frac{a'}{a}(b - e')\\ , .\\ ] ] for simple form of matter with no anisotropic stress ( this is the case for a scalar field ) , we have @xmath87 .",
    "notice that the form of the bardeen potentials is the same whatever the curvature of the spatial sections is .",
    "this is related to the fact that , even if @xmath38 ( or @xmath88 ) , the flrw metric remains conformally flat and the components of the perturbed weyl tensor remain unchanged .",

    "this is a rigorous statement if the scale factor is a power law of the conformal time , which explains the usual confusion between the potential and the hubble scale .",

    "this is not inconsistent though , because after @xmath116 e - folds of inflation have happened , in a closed situation for instance , one expects @xmath117 , with @xmath118 to set the scales , and hence a gigantic value for the scale factor normalization @xmath119 .",
    "however , one then assumes , rightly , that the universe is almost flat , and chooses in general a different normalization for the scale factor , namely @xmath120 , which is many orders of magnitude below what it ought to be .",
    "the relevant wave numbers , seen as eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator , then must scale correspondingly , _",
    "i.e.  _ they are reduced by the amount @xmath121 which is , indeed , much smaller than unity in any inflationary scenario .",
    "the equation of motion for the quantity @xmath96 , eq .",
    "( [ eomu ] ) , has the traditional form of a parametric oscillator equation , _",
    "i.e.  _ of a `` time - independent '' schrdinger equation . however , in the case @xmath122 , the effective potential can not be written as the second time derivative of some function ( @xmath98 in the flat case ) over the same function because of the presence of the term @xmath123 in the time - dependent frequency .",

    "in addition , the effective potential now depends on the wave number @xmath65 through the quantity @xmath132 .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the effective potential for @xmath96 , @xmath104 , which is @xmath65-independent .    having defined the various quantities needed to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations through a bouncing phase , we now turn to the description of the bounce itself .",

    "our aim is therefore to discuss how one can model the scale factor of a bouncing universe . at this point ,",
    "one should notice the differences ( and similarities ) with inflation .",
    "in an inflationary universe , the behavior of the scale factor is known : essentially , this is @xmath136 , _ i.e.  _ the de sitter phase .",

    "the de sitter solution also exists in the bounce case  @xcite and , as we shall see , it can be used in much the same way .",
    "however , contrary to the inflation case , there is no fundamental reason why the background equation of state should be close to vacuum . despite this fact",

    "there is therefore a qualitative difference between the tensor and the scalar modes since the latter can be affected by the bounce provided the nec is almost violated , while the former are never affected , regardless of the underlying parameter values .      in order to make a comparison of our bouncing era to other known transitions",
    ", we first consider below the radiation to matter transition under the hypothesis that this occurs , as observation demands , at some time @xmath356 such that the three - space curvature is negligible .",
    "in other words , we study this transition with @xmath110 .",
    "the scale factor can be given the form @xmath357 , \\label{aradmat}\\ ] ] where @xmath358 is chosen such that @xmath359 .",
    "we have emphasized the two different normalization factors @xmath360 and @xmath361 because they play a different role in the potentials for either @xmath96 or @xmath126 .",
    "indeed , the potential for @xmath126 in this case is @xmath362 , which , for a purely radiation dominated universe ( _ i.e .  _ with @xmath363 and @xmath364 ) , is identically vanishing , whereas the potential for @xmath96 is @xmath365''/\\left [ \\left(a\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\right)^{-1}\\right]$ ] , which in the same situation would be @xmath366 . during the transition however ,",
    "the presence of an amount of matter , however tiny , leads to a nonvanishing @xmath361 , and hence a nonzero diverging term for small conformal times @xmath367 : the radiation dominated universe represents a singular limiting case .",
    "this means that both potentials are large already at small times , deep into the radiation era , and the approximation @xmath368 is accurate both before and after the transition and for both variables .",
    "this accounts for the fact that the bardeen potential changes during the transition , but only insofar as the amplitude is concerned , leaving its spectrum unaltered .",
    "this is because , in this situation , there is no potential crossing : the modes are always below the barrier . fig .  [ 910 ] illustrates this fact and summarizes the situation by showing a sketch of the perturbation potential @xmath369 together with the evolution of the gravitational potential .     for the perturbation variables",

    "( [ aradmat ] ) .",
    "this log - log sketch shows the potential ( full line ) for either of the variables ( they differ by numerical factors ) as well as the exact solution ( for @xmath371 ) for the bardeen potential ( dashed line ) as a function of conformal time.,width=321 ]    another situation of cosmological interest to compare the bounce with is a phase of quasi - exponential inflation followed by preheating and the subsequent epoch of radiation domination . when only one field is present",
    ", the potentials for either @xmath96 or @xmath126 are essentially undistinguishable and both coincide numerically with the inverse hubble size @xmath235 , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ infrde ] . for more than one field ,",
    "the situation is qualitatively different and can not be understood by means of a simple potential  @xcite .",
    "for a given wave number @xmath6 , the spectrum is frozen when the wavelength hits the potential , which is often phrased , because of the similarity with the hubble scale , as `` horizon exit '' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this point , and ref .",
    "@xcite in the bounce context ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ infrde ] , the crucial difference between the two situations , namely preheating and bounce transitions , is that in the latter case the potential and the hubble scale behave in completely different ways whereas they correspond in the former , at least in the region of potential crossing .",
    "far from the bounce itself , however , the potential tends to @xmath235 again , in a fashion similar to what happens during inflation .",
    "we conclude that in the bounce case , the potential is the quantity that matters and the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations . as a consequence , for practical calculatory purposes , the phrase `` hubble crossing '' appears misleading in this context  @xcite and the phrase `` potential crossing '' should be used instead .",
    "in this section , we summarize the main results obtained above and discuss them in a more general framework .    assuming general relativity as the theory describing gravitation during a bouncing stage happening in the early universe , letting the matter content be in the form of a scalar field , and restricting attention to the closed spatial section case in order to satisfy the null energy condition",
    ", we were able to develop a general formalism by expanding any bouncing scale factor around the @xmath57 de sitter - like bouncing solution .",
    "this expansion is characterized by two parameters @xmath186 and @xmath187 which , in some sense , are the counterparts of the slow - roll parameters in the usual inflationary models  @xcite . because this expansion permits a general calculation of the potential for the primordial scalar gravitational perturbations , this allows to fully determine the structure of their evolution as they propagate across the bounce .",
    "the potential @xmath313 obtained is radically different from the hubble scale at the relevant times .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the inflationary paradigm for which @xmath235 and @xmath313 are almost identical .     for the perturbation variables @xmath314 for our bounce model when one connects this bounce transition to both a previous contracting phase on one side and to the usual radiation dominated phase later on the other side.,width=321 ]",
    "an important conclusion of this work is that a bounce phase , even a short one , can affect large scales of perturbations .",
    "general arguments aiming at showing the contrary therefore suffer from our counter - example .",
    "the bounce itself is part of the mechanism described in the introduction , so that the transfer matrix we obtained participates to the one of eq .",
    "( [ transt ] ) through @xmath372 where the @xmath6 dependence stems from the solution ( [ tudelta ] ) and the unknown matrices @xmath373 and @xmath374 refer to the unknown parts sketched in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] .",
    "the coefficients one is interested in , namely @xmath16 and @xmath375 , giving the amplitude of the growing mode in the expanding phase as functions of the modes in the contracting phase , accordingly can depend on @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , it is important to notice that , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this mechanism does not violate causality ; a similar statement was also emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "paradoxically , obtaining a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the bounce lasts the minimal amount of conformal time compatible with the nec preservation .",
    "nevertheless , the assumption of no effect can be justified provided the constraint @xmath376 is satisfied , or in the pure de sitter case having @xmath377 strictly .",
    "this last situation is what happens in models in which the bounce takes place for a vanishing value of the scalar field kinetic energy  @xcite , whereas the former case implies a kinetic energy density ( not the scalar field itself ) for the scalar field comparable to the planck scale , which may render the semi - classical field theory dubious",
    ".    this can be particularly important in view of the string motivated potential alternatives to inflation of the pre big bang kind if it turns out that these models might lead to such spectral corrections as discussed above .",
    "this condition needs be verified in each particular situation .",
    "for instance , in the pre big bang case , one would need to model the bounce occurring in the einstein frame , in which our formalism is well suited , to see what the behaviour of @xmath313 is in this context . therefore , and unfortunately , one consequence of the failure of any general argument preventing any alteration of the spectrum is that one needs to explicitly model a regime in which higher order string corrections are dominant . avoiding this was the main interest of the general argument in question .",
    "we also obtained that the relevant propagation variable is not @xmath126 , whose flat space equivalent is commonly used for quantization , _",
    "i.e.  _ for setting up the initial conditions , but rather the intermediate variable @xmath96 , directly related to the bardeen potential .",
    "this is to be compared with what was recently obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a completely different theory of gravity , in which neither variable happens to be bounded at the bounce .",
    "the spectrum of gravitational wave can not be affected by propagating through these bounces .",
    "this exemplifies the fact that there is no fundamental reason according to which scalar and tensor modes should propagate similarly through a bounce .",
    "the picture that emerges for the construction of a complete model of the universe is shown in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] and consists in a regime in which quantum field theory in a time - dependent background is well suited , as is the case for instance in many string motivated scenarios  @xcite ; this first phase allows an easy calculation of a spectrum of perturbation that would be sort of pre - primordial . then",
    ", unless the curvature was always important in this first period , it is followed by an unknown epoch which connects to the bounce itself , which should also be followed by yet another unknown epoch in order for the curvature to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "this reveals the most important difference between bouncing scenarios and inflation , namely the need for a high curvature phase , which we have seen may drastically modify the physical predictions .",
