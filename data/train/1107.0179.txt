    "<S> in the particle - flow approach information from all available sub - detector systems is combined to reconstruct all stable particles . </S>",
    "<S> the global event reconstruction has been shown to improve , in particular , the resolution of jet energy and missing transverse energy in @xmath0 collisions compared to purely calorimetric measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement is achieved primarily by combining the precise momentum determination of charged hadrons in the silicon tracker with the associated energy depositions in the calorimeters . by resolving individual particles inside jets , </S>",
    "<S> particle flow reduces the sensitivity of the jet energy scale to the jet fragmentation pattern , which is known to be one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainty in jet reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> particle flow reconstruction is thus potentially well - suited for the study of potential modifications to jet fragmentation in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the particle flow algorithm has been adapted to the heavy - ion environment . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of jet reconstruction from particle flow objects in pbpb collisions using the anti-@xmath1 jet reconstruction algorithm is presented .    </S>",
    "<S> the cms detector  @xcite contains four primary sub - detector systems , which are , in order of increasing distance from the beam , a high precision silicon tracking system , a high resolution , high granularity electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) , a somewhat coarser hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) , and finally muon chambers . using a nearly 4 @xmath2 magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , this combination of sub - detectors , allows one , in principle , to distinguish five categories of stable or pseudo - stable particles : charged hadrons , photons , neutral hadrons , muons and electrons .    in the approach traditionally used at hadron colliders </S>",
    "<S> , jets are reconstructed exclusively from calorimeter information ( calo jets ) . in cms jets </S>",
    "<S> are clustered from calorimeter towers which consist of a single hcal cell and the subtended 5x5 set of ecal crystals . </S>",
    "<S> as the tower dimensions are determined by the hcal geometry , the ecal granularity is not exploited in this approach . </S>",
    "<S> the jet resolution is driven by the energy resolution of the hcal ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the particle @xmath4  dependence of the calorimeter response is not corrected for , leading to a non - linear response to jets , causing the jet response to depend on the fragmentation pattern of jets , which translates into an increased uncertainty on the jet energy scale . to further complicate matters , at low @xmath4 , due to the strong magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> charged hadrons are bent outside of a typical jet radius .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternate approach , known as particle flow ( pf ) , individually reconstructs all stable particles by combining information from all available sub - detectors . these reconstructed particle </S>",
    "<S> may then be used as input to a jet reconstruction algorithm in place of calorimeter towers . by making use of the high precision silicon tracker </S>",
    "<S> , one may improve the @xmath4  resolution of charged hadrons , and largely circumvent the non - linearity of the hcal response . </S>",
    "<S> the cms implementation of pf has been shown to largely improve the jet @xmath4  and angular resolution in @xmath0 collisions  @xcite . in heavy - ion collisions </S>",
    "<S> the same pf algorithm is employed . however , charged particle tracks are reconstructed with a different algorithm to cope with the high multiplicity of pbpb collisions . </S>",
    "<S> a hit is required in each of the three layers of the pixel detector which keeps the fake rate very low , even for the most central collisions , but reduces the efficiency to a level of 60 - 70% , compared to about 90% for the @xmath0 algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> charged hadrons for which no track is reconstructed default to a purely calorimetric measurement ( corrected for the expected hadron response ) , degrading the jet energy resolution compared to the @xmath0 algorithm  @xcite .    jet reconstruction in pbpb collisions proceeds as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , the underlying event is subtracted according to the procedure outlined in  @xcite and first employed in  @xcite . as is the case for @xmath0 collisions , the jet energy corrections ( jec ) </S>",
    "<S> are derived from . </S>",
    "<S> data - driven techniques in @xmath0 , such as @xmath5+jet balancing , show that these corrections are valid to within a few % . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of this factorized background subtraction and jec approach can then be tested in events embedded in pbpb events simulated with ( )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> jets are reconstructed with the anti-@xmath1 algorithm with @xmath6 = 0.3 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : subfig1 ] shows the jet reconstruction efficiency in 10% most central events for both pf jets and calo jets reconstructed with a cone algorithm with @xmath6 = 0.5 as described in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pf jet reconstruction is fully efficient by about 50 @xmath7 , a somewhat lower value than for calo jets , mostly owing to the smaller value of @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : subfigureexample ]    for an analysis of dijets , it is important not only to find jets , but to be able to select jet pairs from the same hard scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this issue is investigated in . </S>",
    "<S> first , a leading jet is selected with @xmath4  @xmath8 100 @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we then count the rate at which reconstructed jets on the away - side can not be matched in @xmath9 to an embedded pythia jet . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : subfig2 ] shows the rate of unmatched jets per leading jet as a function of reconstructed jet @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the pf jet selections shows a very small rate of unmatched jets at 40 @xmath7 , significantly lower than calo jets at the same @xmath4 , which is at least partially driven by the smaller value of @xmath6 .        </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 further demonstrates the performance of pf jets in , comparing the reconstructed jet @xmath4  to that obtained by clustering generator level particles . </S>",
    "<S> the top row shows the jet @xmath4  resolution , extracted using a gaussian fit , for several different centrality selections . </S>",
    "<S> pf reconstruction improves the jet resolution over most of the @xmath4  range . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement is , however , partially offset by the decreased value of @xmath6 , which increases the degree to which energy can migrate into and out of the jet , when comparing the reconstructed and generator - level jets . the bottom row of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : res ] shows the jet response , defined as the mean of the ratio of the reconstructed to generated jet @xmath4 , both before and after the application of jecs . as expected , the raw response to pf jets is closer unity , showing that the size of the required jecs is reduced by about half . </S>",
    "<S> the corrected response nicely closes at unity independent of centrality . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the validity of the combined background subtraction + jec procedure and shows that the particle - based jet reconstruction is insensitive to occupancy effects .    </S>",
    "<S> as the jecs corrections are based on an inclusive jet selection in , the true response may differ from that obtained from simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this may arise if the fragmentation of jets is not accurately modeled , for example if the fraction of quark and gluon jets is different in simulation and data . </S>",
    "<S> this may be of particular concern in heavy - ion collisions where quenching is expected to be larger for gluons than for quarks , and the parton distribution functions are less well known than for protons . in fig 3 the corrected response </S>",
    "<S> is shown differentially for quark and gluon jets . </S>",
    "<S> one observes a splitting between the quark jets , which tend to fragment harder than average , and gluon jets , which fragment softer . </S>",
    "<S> however , this splitting smaller for pf jets than calo jets , indicating that pf jet reconstruction is less sensitive to the details of the fragmentation .        </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , pf reconstruction has been performed in heavy - ion collisions for the first time . the jet finding efficiency and the dijet mismatch rate </S>",
    "<S> have been evaluated in simulated data . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of pf - based jet reconstruction has been demonstrated both in terms of both response and resolution and compared to calo - based jet finding . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by studying the response of quark and gluon jets , pf jets were shown to be less sensitive to the details of jet fragmentation than calo jets . </S>"
