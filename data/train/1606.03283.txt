    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system formed on the surface of liquid helium has been widely investigated , especially with regard to the formation and melting of a wigner crystal , or wigner solid ( ws )  @xcite . in the ws phase ,",
    "the electrons are self - trapped in a commensurate surface deformation of liquid @xmath0he called the dimple lattice @xcite .",
    "the self - trapping effect of the surface electrons is similar to the formation of polaron states where electrons are dressed by self - induced lattice deformations , or virtual phonons  @xcite .",
    "being driven by a force parallel to the surface of liquid @xmath0he , the ws moves as a whole keeping the hexagonal order .",
    "the electron motion on liquid helium is associated with surface excitations , or ripplons ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . when traveling faster than the ripplon phase velocity , as in the case of the cherenkov radiation , an electron radiates surface waves and the ripplons emitted by different electrons interfere constructively if the wave number of the ripplons equals the reciprocal lattice vector of the wigner solid ( the bragg condition ) .",
    "this resonant bragg - cherenkov emission of ripplons gives rise to the limitation of the electron velocity  @xcite .",
    "another intriguing nonlinear phenomenon is a sharp rise in mobility at a much higher velocity  @xcite which was attributed to the _ decoupling _ of the ws from the dimple lattice .",
    "this decoupling can be explained within a hydrodynamic model  @xcite assuming that the dimple lattice deepens due to the bragg - cherenkov scattering which bridges the two above - mentioned phenomena .",
    "one of the most actively developing research directions in the field , which became possible due to the recent advances in the microfabrication technology , is the study of the wigner solid in confined geometries using devices such as microchannel arrays  @xcite , single - electron traps  @xcite , field - effect transistors ( fet )  @xcite and charge - coupled devices  @xcite .",
    "one of the advances in this direction was accessing the quantum wire  regime , when the effective width of a conductive channel is less than the thermal wavelength of the electrons .",
    "this was achieved in the recent experiments  @xcite where the transport properties of electrons were measured in a microchannel with the confinement potential controlled on the scale of the inter - electron separation ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "note that in these experimental studies , electrons are confined in channels with constrictions . in our theoretical model developed for an infinite system we only used typical experimental values of the electron density , @xmath2 , and the thickness of the helium film ( helium depth ) , @xmath3 .",
    "the motion of electrons , or in general charged particles , in quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) channels has been analyzed , using numerical simulations , in early works .",
    "for example , the structural , dynamic properties and melting of a q1d system of charged particles , interacting through a screened coulomb potential were studied  @xcite using monte carlo simulations . however , the experiments  @xcite revealed new interesting behavior , such as oscillations in the single - electron conductance in short and long constrictions , which required understanding and therefore stimulated new theoretical and numerical studies .",
    "thus , step - like electric conduction of a classical 2d electron system in a microchannel with a narrow constriction has been analyzed  @xcite .",
    "related numerical studies  @xcite , using molecular - dynamics simulations of langevin equations of motion of interacting electrons on surface of liquid @xmath0he , revealed a significant difference in the electron dynamics for long and short constrictions .",
    "the pronounced current oscillations found for a short constriction were shown to be suppressed for longer constrictions  @xcite , in agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "also , an asymmetric fet - like structure has been proposed  @xcite that allows an easy control of relatively large electron flows and can be used for rectification of an ac - driven electron flow .",
    "furthermore , the authors  @xcite addressed the important issue of the so - called non - sequential ordering of transitions ( non - sot )  characterized by inversions in the subsequent number of electron rows in a q1d channel , e.g. , 1 - 2 - 4 - 3  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , they found the sequence of transitions 1 - 2 - 4 - 3 - 6 - 4 - 5  with two striking inversions 2 - 4 - 3  and 3 - 6 - 4  @xcite and demonstrated that some amount of fluctuations ( i.e. , in the number of particles ) restores the usual sequential order , i.e. , 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 .",
    "the role of the potential profile and the form of the interparticle interaction ( e.g. , the screening length for electrons ) in the appearance of the non - sot has been recently further analyzed in detail  @xcite .    despite the above technological , experimental and theoretical advances in the study of the wigner solid ,",
    "some of the fundamental properties of this system still remain not well - understood .",
    "moreover , recent experimental studies revealed a number of related issues to be addressed .",
    "for example , the experiment  @xcite revealed a very gradual increase in the electron effective mass as the temperature drops below the ws transition temperature , while the theory predicted  @xcite a full formation of dimples at the transition temperature and a very weak temperature dependence .",
    "also , the mechanisms of the decoupling of the wigner solid from the dimple lattice towards an electron wigner solid are not yet understood in detail .",
    "also , despite great efforts to observe a bound single - polaron state experimentally , this is still an open problem .",
    "the polaronic wigner crystal is a well - established phenomenon , but the situation for single polarons ( which has a particular interest in view of the polaron liquid discussed below ) is not yet clear . the work on the observation of a single polaron @xcite was strongly debated .    here",
    ", we analyze in detail various phases of the electron - ripplon system , i.e. , when the ws is coupled to the dimple lattice , when the ws still exists but is decoupled from the dimple lattice , and when the ws melts , depending on such parameters of the system as the strength of the electron - ripplon interaction , temperature and the electron concentration . also a polaron liquid phase",
    "is predicted in the present work at sufficiently high temperatures combined with high coupling strengths . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this phase was not yet considered in the literature .",
    "the treatment is performed within the variational scheme similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite for multielectron bubbles in liquid helium .",
    "the hamiltonian of a single electron on a flat helium surface is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electron momentum operator , @xmath6 is the electron mass @xmath7 is the surface area , @xmath8 is given by @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the surface tension of helium , @xmath12 @xmath13 is the mass density of helium , and @xmath14 is the acceleration of the liquid due to its van der waals coupling to the substrate @xcite ( where @xmath15 is the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath16 is the van der waals coupling of the helium to the substrate ) . in the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to 2d position and momentum operators , assuming that the part of the wave function of the electrons relating to the direction perpendicular to the surface can be factored out exactly .",
    "the second - quantization operators @xmath17 create / annihilate a ripplon with planar wave number @xmath18 .",
    "the electron - ripplon coupling amplitude is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electric field perpendicular to the surface ( the so - called ` pressing field ' ) , @xmath21 is the electron charge , and @xmath3 is the thickness of the helium film .",
    "the pressing field pushes the electrons with a force @xmath22 towards the helium surface . a 1 ev barrier prevents electrons from penetrating the helium surface .",
    "the total electric field is a sum of an external ( manually applied ) field @xmath23 and the electric field induced by the image charge in the substrate with the dielectric constant @xmath24:@xmath25    it should be noted that the areas of parameters for different phases of a ripplonic polaron system must be determined with a special care on the stability of the system itself .",
    "for example , at very high densities , there can exist an instability of the polaron when the pressing field becomes too large @xcite .",
    "also there is a maximum surface density of electrons when a uniform distribution is stable on a flat surface @xcite .",
    "the self - induced trapping potential of the electron on the helium surface is manifested by the appearance of a dimple in the helium surface underneath the electron , much like the deformation of a rubber sheet when a person is pulled down on it by a gravitational force .",
    "the resulting quasiparticle consists of the electron together with its dimple and can be called a ripplonic polaron or ripplopolaron @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) for the ripplopolarons is very similar to the frhlich hamiltonian describing polarons @xcite ; the role of the phonons is now played by the ripplons .",
    "methods suitable for the study of single polarons have been used to analyze the single polaron on a flat surface @xcite .",
    "the path integral treatment for a wigner solid of polarons has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we adapt their method so that it becomes suitable for the treatment of a lattice of ripplopolarons in multielectron bubbles .",
    "in their treatment of the electron wigner solid embedded in a polarizable medium such as a semiconductors or an ionic solid , fratini and qumerais @xcite described the effect of the electrons on a particular electron through a mean - field lattice potential .",
    "the ( classical ) lattice potential @xmath26 is obtained by approximating all the electrons acting on one particular electron by a homogenous charge density in which a hole is punched out ; this hole is centered in the lattice point of the particular electron under investigation and has a radius given by the lattice distance @xmath27 .",
    "thus , in their approach , anisotropy effects , e.  g. , related to the lattice orientation , are neglected .",
    "a second assumption implicit in this approach is that the effects of exchange are neglected .",
    "this can be justified by noting that for the electrons to form a wigner solid it is required that their wave function is localized to within a fraction of the lattice parameter as follows from the lindemann criterion @xcite .    within this particular mean - field approximation , the lattice potential can be calculated from classical electrostatics and we find that for a 2d electron gas it can be expressed in terms of the elliptic functions of first and second kind , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30   \\right .",

    "@xmath33 the ` phonon ' frequency @xmath34 of the electron wigner solid corresponds closely to the longitudinal plasmon frequency that can be derived using an entirely different approach based on a more rigorous study of the modes of oscillations of both the helium surface and the charge distribution on the surface . from this , and from the successful application of this mean - field approach to polaron crystals in solids , we conclude that the approach based on that of fratini and qumerais describes the influence of the other electrons well in the framework of small amplitude oscillations of the electrons around their lattice point .",
    "the phenomenological lindemann melting criterion @xcite suggests that the wigner solid will melt when the electrons are on average displaced more than a certain value @xmath35 from their lattice position ; thus in the regime of interest the fratini - qumerais approach is applicable . in the mean - field approximation ,",

    "the simple but intuitive approach of the previous section describes the system in the limit of zero temperature . to study the ripplopolaron wigner solid at finite temperature ( and for any value of the electron - ripplon coupling ) , we use the variational path - integral approach @xcite .",

    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : pd1 ] that at sufficiently low densities , the melting temperature for the transition between a polaron or electron wigner solid to a polaron or electron liquid only weakly depends on the electron - ripplon coupling constant @xmath79 , and it becomes more sensitive to @xmath79 at higher densities .",
    "this weak coupling depencence of the melting temperature can be explained by the fact that an overlap of polaron dimples at low densities is relatively small , increasing when rising density .",
    "the melting temperature is a non - monotonic function of @xmath79 , which is one of manifestations of the reentrant melting discussed below .",

    "this critical @xmath79 rises when increasing temperature . at higher temperatures , when increasing @xmath79 , the electron liquid can change to the polaron liquid without forming a polaron wigner solid .",
    "it is often assumed that the formation of polaron dimples always leads to their wigner crystallization .",
    "however , according to the present variational calculation , there exists a regime where the polarons are not yet dissociated but their mass is not large enough to form a wigner crystal . as seen from fig .",

    ". this change of sequence of phases between ripplopolaron systems at lower and higher temperatures finds a transparent physical explanation through the interplay of the following factors . on one hand , at high temperatures the formation of a polaron dimple can be favored by the strengthening of the confinement potential , because the thermal fluctuations of the electron motion become gradually more restricted by the neighboring electrons when decreasing the inter - electron distance . on the other hand , at low temperatures , when thermal fluctuations are less important , melting of the electron wigner solid can be favored by zero - temperature quantum fluctuations of the electron motion : this is the case of _ quantum melting_. we do see quantum melting at nonzero temperature , and it is expected to persist down to @xmath122 .",

    "[ fig : pd2 ] , the sequences of different phases when varying the electron concentration and temperature can be described and physically explained in the following way . at small concentrations and low temperatures , the system naturally turns into a polaron wigner crystal .",
    "when increasing the temperature while keeping the concentration constant , the polaron wigner crystal can either melt to a polaron liquid at low densities , or shed the dimple and change to an electron wigner crystal at higher densities . in the former case , the breakdown of the polaron wigner crystal occurs through the melting of the lattice , but polaron dimples survive . in the latter case , the polaron wigner solid",
    "is changed to the electron wigner solid through the polaron dissociation .",
    "when temperature rises further , both the electron wigner crystal and the polaron liquid can change to the electron liquid but in a different way : the electron wigner crystal melts , while the polaron liquid dissociates . when increasing the electron concentration at fixed temperature , also the electron wigner crystal can melt .",
    "[ th ]    pd-t-n.eps    remarkably , the electron liquid phase appears not only for high temperatures but also as an island  for low temperatures and high electron concentrations ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : pd2](_a _ ) and [ fig : pd3 ] ) .",
    "this means that the system displays a reentrant melting transition from the electron liquid phase to the electron solid phase at some fixed high @xmath2 when increasing the temperature or decreasing the coupling strength . in other words",

    "this counter - intuitive behavior does not violate principles of thermodynamics and has been observed both in non - equilibrium and equilibrium systems , see , e.  g. , @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the mechanism of the inverse melting was explained by the fluctuation - driven increase of the effective size of the particles ( i.e. , the area effectively occupied by the particle during its fluctuation - driven random motion ) in the molten state such that they form a solid state with increasing temperature . for ripplonic polarons , the revealed sequence of the reentrant electron phases when increasing temperature at high electron concentrations can be explained in other way : by the fact that the melting phase transition is differently driven by quantum and thermal fluctuations . in ( [ rc ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) , _ thermal _ fluctuations contribute to the temperature dependence of @xmath138 and @xmath139 through the distribution functions @xmath140 .",
    "the contribution of _ quantum _ fluctuations to the temperature dependence of the averaged squared radii occurs through the polaron parameters @xmath141 ( which also depend on temperature ) .",
    "the electron - ripplon interaction can become effectively stronger with rising temperature in some range of temperatures , and hence the ripplon - induced potential for an electron becomes deeper and narrower in that range .",
    "quantum fluctuations may then favor to a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath138 as a function of temperature . on the contrary",
    ", thermal fluctuations always contribute to increase @xmath138 .",
    "thus the transition temperature can result from an interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations .    when increasing the temperature , the area of the reentrant melting transition shifts to higher concentrations , so that is not seen in fig .",

    "@xcite ( where a stable wigner crystal has been detected ) is rather weak , @xmath143 .",
    "hence the obtained phase diagrams are in agreement with these experiments .",
    "we can also suggest that the wigner solid in the experiments @xcite can be classified as an electron wigner solid .",
    "for the experiments where the melting point of the electron wigner lattice at the helium surface was determined using measurements of the mobility and the microwave response @xcite , the thickness of the helium film was significantly smaller than in the phase diagrams calculated in the present work .",
    "however these experiments are also related to the very weak - coupling polaron regime , where the electron ws rather than the polaron ws can exist .",
    "it should be noted that the film thickness at high densities can be strongly reduced @xcite .",
    "consequently , at electron densities of @xmath144@xmath93 and higher the helium film can hardly have a thickness @xmath110 .",
    "therefore some portions of the phase diagrams shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pd1 ] to [ fig : pd3 ] are experimentally not accessible .",

    "in the present work , we have analyzed different phases of a ripplonic polaron system on the surface of a liquid helium film , and the behavior of these phases when varying parameters of the system : the temperature , the electron concentration , and the electron - ripplon coupling strength .",

    "the treatment has been performed within the arbitrary - coupling and finite - temperature variational path - integral formalism based on the jensen - feynman variational principle for the free energy .",
    "we demonstrated that , by varying the electron - ripplon coupling strength @xmath79 and other parameters such as the electron concentration @xmath2 on the helium surface and temperature @xmath42 , in the vicinity of typical experimental values , the system displays a rich phase behavior .",
    "we have found that the experimental conditions corresponding to ref .",
    "@xcite are favorable for the electron wigner solid decoupled from the dimple lattice rather than for other phases .",

    ", we revealed four different phases : ( i ) the electron solid ( lattice ) , at low temperatures and weak couplings ; ( ii ) the polaron wigner solid , at low temperatures and strong couplings ; ( iii ) the electron liquid , at high temperatures and weak couplings ; and ( iv ) the polaron liquid phase , when the polaron wigner solid melts but the electrons do not decouple from the dimples , due to the strong electron - ripplon coupling .",
    "remarkably , it should be possible to observe all the predicted phases at typical experimental temperatures close to @xmath145  k  @xcite , for varying electron concentration and the electron - ripplon coupling strength . for lower temperatures ,",
    "some of the phases disappear , like the polaron liquid phase .",

    "this transition is known as the freezing by heating  transition when fluctuations result in a solidification of a molten state .",
    "the mean - field wigner approximation used in the present work was successfully applied to polaron wigner lattices in ionic crystals @xcite .",
    "the application of this mean - field approach to the ws on a liquid helium surface needs however some care .",
    "there exists an enhancement of coupling constant in the wigner solid phase due to the bragg scattering of ripplons @xcite .",
    "the bragg scattering of ripplons from the electron lattice gives rise to an enhanced deformation of the dimple lattice @xcite .",
    "this effect can be taken into account , e.g. , by introducing an effective debye - waller factor in the polaron action ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the effect of the bragg scattering can be especially important at rather weak couplings .",
    "it can lead to a quantitative change of the polaron energy and , consequently , to some shift of the boundaries on the phase diagrams .",
