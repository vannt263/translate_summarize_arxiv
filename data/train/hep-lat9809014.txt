    "an appealing mechanism for confinement of colour in qcd is dual superconductivity of the vacuum@xcite . by dual meissner effect the chromoelectric field acting between a @xmath0 pair",
    "is confined into an abrikosov flux tube , which in the ground state configuration has energy proportional to the distance : @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 is the string tension .",
    "the idea that the strings appearing in hadron phenomenology could be abrikosov flux tubes goes back to ref.@xcite , which was inspired by the veneziano model@xcite .",
    "due to asymptotic freedom , it is very likely that qcd exists as a field theory , or that its euclidean version describes a statistical system for which a thermodynamical limit exists .",
    "for the same reason a significant sample of lattice configurations should be a good approximation to that limit and should identify the true vacuum , if the correlation length @xmath3 is much larger than the lattice spacing @xmath4 , and much smaller then the lattice size @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "dual superconductivity means condensation of monopole charges , or spontaneous breaking of the @xmath7 symmetry related to their conservation .",
    "the colour deconfining transition is therefore , in this mechanism , a transition order - disorder , which can be investigated as a change of symmetry by use of an order parameter@xcite .",
    "a sensible strategy to attack the problem is    * identify the relevant magnetic @xmath7 * detect the deconfining transition by looking at the symmetry of the vacuum .",
    "the question a ) will be discussed in sect.2 , the question b ) in sect.3 .",
    "the prototype of monopoles are thooft@xcite - polyakov@xcite monopoles , which were discovered as solitons of the georgi glashow model@xcite @xmath8 @xmath9 if @xmath10 , the @xmath11 symmetry of the model spontaneously breaks  la higgs to @xmath7 , and @xmath12 .",
    "a time independent ansatz of the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 as @xmath15 , admits a solution with finite energy , in which @xmath16 , @xmath17 are practically equal to 1 everywhere except in a small radius @xmath18 .",
    "the solution has the geometry of a monopole .",
    "this is explicitly seen by transforming to the gauge in which @xmath19 is constant , say @xmath20 : the corresponding gauge transformation @xmath21 is called abelian projection .",
    "@xmath21 is singular at @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the abelian gauge field of the residual @xmath7 symmetry in this gauge @xmath24 is the field of a dirac monopole in the soliton configuration @xmath25 in a covariant form @xmath26 in terms of @xmath27 the magnetic current is defined by @xmath28 and is identically conserved : @xmath29 a magnetic @xmath7 symmetry exists .",
    "both @xmath30 and the magnetic charge @xmath31 are colour singlets .",
    "one can operate the abelian projection @xmath32 on generic configurations also in the unbroken phase of the system , where monopoles do not exist as solitons .",
    "@xmath21 will be singular at the sites where @xmath33 and the singularities will reflect in the topology of the gauge field , as a dirac strings .",
    "monopoles are lumps in the higgs phase , but they can also exist in the symmetric phase , where they condense .    in qcd there is no higgs field .",
    "however any operator in the adjoint representation can play the role of @xmath34 , and define monopoles which are exposed by the corresponding abelian projection .    on the lattice",
    "any closed path of parallel transport defines a @xmath34 in the adjoint representation .",
    "an open plaquette , an open polyakov line , an open `` butterfly '' , @xmath35 . there",
    "exist in fact a continuous infinity@xcite of monopoles species .",
    "what monopoles do condense in the vacuum ?",
    "a guess of t  hooft@xcite is that all of them are physically equivalent : configuration by configuration the location and the number of the monopoles is different , but on the average they are indistinguishable .    there is a community of practitioners of the maximal abelian projection@xcite or of the delambertian projection@xcite , who believe that their choice is better than others because of abelian and monopole dominance@xcite .",
    "the physical quantities , like the string tension , relevant to confinement , are indeed approximated within @xmath36 by the corresponding quantities computed in the abelian projected @xmath7 , or in terms of the monopole part of them , meaning that the projection identifies the degrees of freedom relevant to confinement .",
    "the basic idea is to construct an operator @xmath37 which carries non zero monopole charge , and use its vacuum expectation value @xmath38 as a detector of symmetry .",
    "@xmath39 signals spontaneous breaking of magnetic @xmath7 , and hence , under very general assumptions , dual superconductivity . in a theory",
    "in which electric charges are pointlike , magnetic monopoles have non trivial topology , due to dirac string : moreover they are coupled with magnetic charge @xmath40 due to dirac quantization condition .",
    "a similar feature is present in a variety of systems in statistical mechanics and is known as duality .",
    "the prototype is the 2d ising model@xcite , where the system can be described either in terms of local spin @xmath41 , or in terms of 1 dimensional kinks which are spins on the dual lattice .",
    "the partition function is the same with the correspondence @xmath42 which maps strong coupling regime of the model with weak coupling of its dual .",
    "the basic idea to construct a creation operator for a topological configuration is to shift the field configuration by the classical topological configuration by the translation operator@xcite .    in the same way as @xmath43    @xmath44\\label{eq:7}\\ ] ]    operates on a field configuration @xmath45 as @xmath46 which describes a monopole sitting at site @xmath47 and propagating from time @xmath48 to @xmath49 .    at large values of @xmath50 @xmath51",
    "@xmath52 means dual superconductivity .    at finite temperature a direct measurement of @xmath38",
    "can be done : then antiperiodic boundary conditions in time are needed@xcite .    instead of",
    "@xmath53 it can prove numerically convenient to measure @xmath54 .    at large values of @xmath50",
    "again from eq.([eq:9 ] ) @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 for @xmath58 @xmath59 the typical behaviour of @xmath60 at the deconfining phase transition for @xmath61 gauge theory is shown in fig.1 , for different monopole species .",
    "0.95     + * fig.1 * @xmath60 vs @xmath62 for different abelian projections in @xmath61 .",
    "the negative peak signals phase transition .",
    "0.1 in    the main results are    * different monopole species have indistinguishable behaviour . * for @xmath63",
    "@xmath60 tends to a finite limit as spatial volume goes to @xmath64 , showing that @xmath39 in the confined phase . * for @xmath65",
    "the regime is perturbative and @xmath66 with @xmath67 the space extension of the lattice .",
    "this means that @xmath68 as @xmath69 , i.e. in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the expectation for @xmath38 as a disorder parameter would be zero for @xmath70 .",
    "this can only happen in the thermodynamical limit : for finite volume @xmath38 is an analytic function of @xmath62 for any finite size of the lattice , and can not vanish identically for @xmath65 , except if it vanishes for all values of @xmath62 . only in the infinite volume limit lee yang singularities develop@xcite and",

    "the correlation length goes large , @xmath73 with @xmath74 a critical index . by dimensional arguments , @xmath75 or by eq.([eq:12 ] ) @xmath76 whence the scaling law follows @xmath77 scaling is obeyed only with the proper value of index @xmath74 , which can be then determined , together with @xmath78 .",
    "the quality of scaling is shown in fig.2 and the corresponding value of @xmath74 , determined by best fit procedure is @xmath79 the expectation is that the transition is second order and that it belongs to the same class of universality as the 3d ising model , or @xmath80    0.95     + * fig.2 * finite size scaling eq.([eq:15 ] ) .",
    "@xmath61 . 0.1 in    a similar analysis@xcite for @xmath81 shows that there is no appreaciable difference neither in the disorder parameters for the 2 possible choices of monopoles defined by a given abelian projection , nor between different abelian projections ( plaquette , polyakov line , butterfly ) , fig.3,fig.4 .    0.95     + * fig.3 * @xmath60 for the two different monopole species in the polyakov projection . @xmath81 . 0.1 in    an attempt to determine an effective critical index for the transition , which is known to be weak first order gives @xmath82 .",
