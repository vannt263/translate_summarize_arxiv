    "because many natural systems are organized as networks , in which the nodes ( be they cells , individuals , populations or web servers ) interact in a time - dependent fashion  the study of networks has been an important focus in recent research .",
    "one of the particular points of interest has been the question of how the hardwired _ structure _ of a network ( its underlying graph ) affects its _ function _ , for example in the context of optimal information storage or transmission between nodes along time .",
    "it has been hypothesized that there are two key conditions for optimal function in such networks : a well - balanced adjacency matrix ( the underlying graph should appropriately combine robust features and random edges ) and well - balanced connection strengths , driving optimal dynamics in the system .",
    "however , only recently has mathematics started to study rigorously ( through a combined graph theoretical and dynamic approach ) the effects of configuration patterns on the efficiency of network function , by applying graph theoretical measures of segregation ( clustering coefficient , motifs , modularity , rich clubs ) , integration ( path length , efficiency ) and influence ( node degree , centrality ) .",
    "various studies have been investigating the sensitivity of a system s temporal behavior to removing / adding nodes or edges at different places in the network structure , and have tried to relate these patterns to applications to natural networks .",
    "brain functioning is one of the most intensely studied contexts which requires our understanding of the tight inter - connections between system architecture and dynamics .",
    "the brain is organized as a `` dynamic network , '' self - interacting in a time - dependent fashion at multiple spacial and temporal scales , to deliver an optimal range for biological functioning .",
    "the way in which these modules are wired together in large networks that control complex cognition and behavior is one of the great scientific challenges of the 21st century , currently being addressed by large - scale research collaborations , such as the human connectome project .",
    "graph theoretical studies of empirical empirical data support certain generic topological properties of brain architecture , such as modularity , small - worldness , the existence of hubs and `` rich clubs ''  @xcite .    in order to explain how connectivity patterns may affect the system s dynamics ( e.g. , in the context of stability and synchronization in networks of coupled neural populations ) , and thus the observed behavior ,",
    "a lot of effort has been thus invested towards formal modeling approaches , using a combination of analytical and numerical methods from nonlinear dynamics and graph theory , in both biophysical models  @xcite and simplified systems  @xcite .",
    "these analyses revealed a rich range of potential dynamic regimes and transitions  @xcite , shown to depend as much on the coupling parameters of the network as on the arrangement of the excitatory and inhibitory connections  @xcite .",
    "the construction of a realistic , data - compatible computational model has been subsequently found to present many difficulties that transcend the existing methods from nonlinear dynamics , and may in fact require : ( 1 ) new analysis and book - keeping methods and ( 2 ) a new framework that would naturally encompass the rich phenomena intrinsic to these systems  both of which aspects are central to our proposed work .    in a paper with dr .",
    "verduzco - flores  @xcite , one of the authors of this paper first explored the idea of having network connectivity as a bifurcation parameter for the ensemble dynamics in a continuous time system of coupled differential equations .",
    "we used configuration dependent phase spaces and our probabilistic extension of bifurcation diagrams in the parameter space to investigate the relationship between classes of system architectures and classes of their possible dynamics , and we observed the robustness of the coupled dynamics to certain changes in the network architecture and its vulnerability to others . as expected , when translating connectivity patterns to network dynamics , the main difficulties were raised by the combination of graph complexity and the system s intractable dynamic richness .",
    "in order to break down and better understand this dependence , we started to investigate it in simpler theoretical models , where one may more easily identify and pair specific structural patterns to their effects on dynamics .",
    "the logistic family is historically perhaps the most - studied family of maps in nonlinear dynamics , whose behavior is by now relatively well understood .",
    "therefore , we started by looking in particular at how dynamic behavior depends on connectivity in networks with simple logistic nodes .",
    "this paper focuses on definitions , concepts and observations in low - dimensional networks .",
    "future work will address large networks , and different classes of maps .",
    "dynamic networks with discrete nodes and the dependence of their behavior on connectivity parameters have been previously described in several contexts over the past two decades .",
    "for example , in an early paper , wang considered a simple neural network of only two excitatory / inhibitory neurons , and analyzed it as a parameterized family of two - dimensional maps , proving existence of period - doubling to chaos and strange attractors in the network  @xcite .",
    "masolle , attay et al . have found that , in networks of delay - coupled logistic maps , synchronization regimes and formation of anti - phase clusters depend on coupling strength  @xcite and on the edge topology ( characterized by the spectrum of the graph laplacian )  @xcite .",
    "yu has constructed and studied a network wherein the undirected edges symbolize the nodes relation of adjacency in an integer sequence obtained from the logistic mapping and the top integral function  @xcite .    in our present work ,",
    "we focus on investigating , in the context of networked maps , extensions of the julia and mandelbrot sets traditionally defined for single map iterations . for three different model networks ,",
    "we use a combination of analytical and numerical tools to illustrate how the system behavior ( measured via topological properties of the _ julia sets _ ) changes when perturbing the underlying adjacency graph .",
    "we differentiate between the effects on dynamics of different perturbations that directly modulate network connectivity : increasing / decreasing edge weights , and altering edge configuration by adding , deleting or moving edges .",
    "we discuss the implications of considering a rigorous extension of fatou - julia theory known to apply for iterations of single maps , to iterations of ensembles of maps coupled as nodes in a network .",
    "the logistic map is historically perhaps the best - known family of maps in nonlinear dynamics .",
    "iterations of one single quadratic function have been studied starting in the early 19th century , with the work of fatou and julia .",
    "the prisoner set of a map @xmath3 is defined as the set of all points in the complex dynamic plane , whose orbits are bounded .",
    "the escape set of a complex map is the set of all points whose orbits are unbounded .",
    "the julia set of @xmath3 is defined as their common boundary @xmath4 .",
    "the filled julia set is the union of prisoner points with their boundary @xmath4 .    for polynomial maps",
    ", it has been shown that the connectivity of a map s julia set is tightly related to the structure of its critical orbits ( i.e. , the orbits of the map s critical points ) .",
    "due to extensive work spanning almost one century , from julia  @xcite and fatou  @xcite until recent developments  @xcite , we now have the following : + * fatou - julia theorem . * _ for a polynomial with at least one critical orbit unbounded , the julia set is totally disconnected if and only if all the bounded critical orbits are aperiodic . _",
    "+ for a single iterated logistic map@xcite , the fatou - julia theorem implies that the julia set is either totally connected , for values of @xmath5 in the mandelbrot set ( i.e. , if the orbit of the critical point 0 is bounded ) , or totally disconnected , for values of @xmath5 outside of the mandelbrot set ( i.e. , if the orbit of the critical point 0 is unbounded ) . in previous work",
    ", the authors showed that this dichotomy breaks in the case of random iterations of two maps  @xcite . in our current work ,",
    "we focus on extensions for networked logistic maps .",
    "although julia and mandelbrot sets have been studied somewhat in connection with coupled systems  @xcite , none of the existing work seems to address the basic problems of how these sets can be defined for networks of maps , how different aspects of the network hardwiring affect the topology of these sets and whether there is any fatou - julia type result in this context .",
    "these are some of the questions addressed in this paper , which is organized as follows : in section  [ logistic_maps ] , we introduce definitions of our network setup , as well as of the extensions of mandelbrot and julia sets that we will be studying . in order to illustrate some basic ideas and concepts , we concentrate on three examples of 3-dimensional networks , which differ from each other in edge distribution , and whose connectivity strengths are allow to vary .",
    "in section  [ complex_maps ] , we focus on the behavior of these 3-dimensional models when we consider the nodes as complex iterated variables .",
    "we analyze the similarities and differences between node - wise behavior in each case , and we investigate the topological perturbations in one - dimensional complex slices of the mandelbrot and julia sets , as the connectivity changes from one model to the next , through intermediate stages . in section  [ real_maps ] , we address the same questions for real logistic nodes , with the advantage of being able to visualize the entire network mandelbrot and julia sets , as 3-dimensional real objects . in both sections ,",
    "we conjecture weaker versions of the fatou - julia theorem , connecting points in the mandelbrot set with connectivity properties of the corresponding julia sets .",
    "finally , in section  [ discussion ] , we interpret our results both mathematically and in the larger context of network sciences .",
    "we also briefly preview future work on high - dimensional networks and on networks with adaptable nodes and edges .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath6 nodes coupled according to the edges of an oriented graph , with adjacency matrix @xmath7 ( on which one may impose additional structural conditions , related to edge density or distribution ) . in isolation , each node @xmath8 , @xmath9 , functions as a discrete nonlinear map @xmath10 , changing at each iteration @xmath11 as @xmath12 . when coupled as a network with adjacency @xmath13 , each node will also receive contributions through the incoming edges from the adjacent nodes . throughout this paper , we will consider an additive rule of combining these contributions , for a couple of reasons : first , summing weighted incoming inputs is one simple , yet mathematically nontrivial way to introduce the cross talk between nodes ; second , summing weighted inputs inside a nonlinear integrating function is reminiscent of certain mechanisms studied in the natural sciences ( such as the integrate and fire neural mechanism studied in our previous work in the context of coupled dynamics ) . the coupled system will then have the following general form :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 are the weights along the adjacency edges .",
    "one may view this system simply as an iteration of an @xmath6-dimensional map @xmath16 , with @xmath17 ( in the case of real - valued nodes ) , or respectively @xmath18 ( in the case of complex - valued nodes ) .",
    "the new and exciting aspect that we are proposing in our work is to study the dependence of the coupled dynamics on the parameters , in particular on the coupling scheme ( adjacency matrix )  viewed itself as a system parameter . to fix these ideas , we focused first on defining these questions and proposing hypotheses for the case of quadratic node - dynamics .",
    "the logistic family is one of the most studied family of maps in the context of both real and complex dynamics of a single variable .",
    "it was also the subject of our previous modeling work on random iterations .    in this paper in particular",
    ", we will work with quadratic node - maps , with their traditional parametrization @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the complex case and @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the real case .",
    "the network variable will be called respectively @xmath24 in the case of complex nodes , and @xmath25 in the case of real nodes .",
    "we consider both the particular case of identical quadratic maps ( equal @xmath5 values ) , and the general case of different maps attached to the nodes throughout the network . in both cases",
    ", we aim to study the asymptotic behavior of iterated node - wise orbits , as well as of the @xmath6-dimensional orbits ( which we will call multi - orbits ) . as in the classical theory of fatou and julia",
    ", we will investigate when orbits escape to infinity or remain bounded , and how much of this information is encoded in the critical multi - orbit of the system .",
    "for the following definitions , fix the network ( i.e. , fix the adjacency @xmath13 and the edge weights @xmath26 ) . to avoid redundancy , we give definitions for the complex case , but they can be formulated similarly for real maps :    for a fixed parameter @xmath27 , we call the * filled multi - julia set * of the network , the locus of @xmath28 which produce a bounded multi - orbit in @xmath29",
    ". we call the * filled uni - julia set * the locus of @xmath30 so that @xmath31 produces a bounded multi - orbit .",
    "the * multi - julia set ( or the multi - j set ) * of the network is defined as the boundary in @xmath29 of the filled multi - julia set .",
    "similarly , one defines the * uni - julia set ( or uni - j set ) * of the network as the boundary in @xmath32 of its filled counterparts .",
    "we define the * multi - mandelbrot set ( or the multi - m set ) * of the network the parameter locus of @xmath27 for which the multi - orbit of the critical point @xmath33 is bounded in @xmath29 .",
    "we call the * equi - mandelbrot set ( or the equi - m set ) * of the network , the locus of @xmath21 for which the critical multi - orbit is bounded for * equi - parameter * @xmath34 .",
    "we call the * @xmath35th node equi - m set * the locus @xmath21 such that the component of the multi - orbit of @xmath33 corresponding to the @xmath35th node remains bounded in @xmath32 .",
    "we study , using a combination of analytical and numerical methods , how the structure of the julia and mandelbrot sets varies under perturbations of the node - wise dynamics ( i.e. , under changes of the quadratic multi- parameter @xmath36 ) and under perturbations of the coupling scheme ( i.e. , of the adjacency matrix @xmath13 and of the coupling weights @xmath26 ) . in this paper",
    ", we start with investigating these questions in small ( 3-dimensional ) networks , with specific adjacency configurations . in a subsequent paper , we will move to investigate how similar phenomena may be quantified and studied analytically and numerically in high - dimensional networks . in both cases",
    ", we are interested in particular in observing differences in the effects on dynamics of three different aspects of the network architecture : ( 1 ) increasing / decreasing edge weights , ( 2 ) increasing / decreasing edge density , ( 3 ) altering edge configuration by adding , deleting or moving edges .        while a desired objective would be to obtain general results for all network sizes ( since many natural networks are large ) , we start by studying simple , low dimensional systems . in this study",
    ", we focus on simple networks formed of three nodes , connected by different network geometries and edge weights . to fix our ideas",
    ", we will follow and illustrate three structures in particular ( also see figure  [ 3d_net ] ) : ( 1 ) two input nodes @xmath37 and @xmath38 are self driven by quadratic maps , and the single output node @xmath39 is driven symmetrically by the two input nodes ; @xmath37 additionally communicates with @xmath38 via an edge of variable weight @xmath40 , which can take both positive and negative values .",
    "we will call this the * _ simple dual model_*. ( 2 ) in addition to the simple dual scheme , the output node @xmath39 is also self - driven , i.e. there is a self - loop on @xmath39 of weight @xmath41 ( which can be positive or negative ) .",
    "we will call this the * _ self - drive model_*. ( 3 ) in addition to the self - driven model , there is also feedback from the output node @xmath39 into the node @xmath38 , via a new edge of variable weight @xmath3 .",
    "we will call this the * _ feedback model_*. unless specified , edges have positive unit weight . notice that the same effect as negative feed - forward edges from @xmath37 and @xmath38 into @xmath39 can be obtained by changing the sign of @xmath41 , etc .",
    "the three connectivity models we chose to study and compare are described by the equations below : +    * _ simple dual model : _ * @xmath42    * _ self - drive model : _ * @xmath43    * _ feedback model : _ * @xmath44    for a fixed multi - parameter @xmath45 for example , one can see all three systems as generated by a network map @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , defined as @xmath49_1),f_{c_2}([az]_2),f_{c_3}([az]_3))$ ] , for any @xmath50 .",
    "we try to classify and understand the effects that coupling changes have on the topology of multi - j and multi - m sets for both complex and real networked maps .",
    "we do nt expect all classical topology results on the julia and mandelbrot sets for single maps ( e.g. , fatou - julia theorem , or connectivity of the mandelbrot set ) to carry out for networks of coupled maps .",
    "however , since the topology of the full sets in @xmath51 is somewhat harder to inspect , we study as a first step their equi - slices and node - wise equi - slices , which are objects in @xmath32 .",
    "we will track and compare in particular the differences between the three models , but also the geometric and topological changes produced on the equi - slices within each one model for different values of the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath3 .",
    "none of these results , however , can be directly extrapolated to similar conclusions on the full sets . to offer some insight into the latter , we study the multi - m and multi - j sets in the context of real maps , for which there objects can be visualized in @xmath52 .",
    "a first intuitive question is when the nodes of the network have similar behavior , and whether if one node - wise orbit is bounded , the others will remain bounded .",
    "this relationship is trivial to establish in some cases , such as for example in the simple dual model with independent input nodes ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) . indeed , in this model , for any fixed @xmath21 , the origin s orbit in @xmath51 under @xmath54 can be described as : @xmath55    the projection of the orbit in any of the three components only depends on the previous states of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and these three sequences are simultaneously bounded in @xmath32 , hence the node - specific equi - mandelbrot sets are all identical with the traditional mandelbrot set .",
    "some basic connections between node - wise equi - m sets in each of the three models are stated below .",
    "we will prove these incrementally ( recall that the dual model is a particular case of self - drive for @xmath56 , and the self - drive is a particular case of feedback model with @xmath57 ) .    , the equi - mandelbrot set for the nodes @xmath38 and @xmath39 are identical ( red ) , but different from the set for the node @xmath37 ( blue ) * b. * for the self - drive model with negative feedback , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the equi - mandelbrot sets for the three nodes @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( shown respectively in blue , green and red ) are all different . * c. * for the feedback model with with negative feedback , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , the equi - mandelbrot set for the nodes @xmath38 and @xmath39 are identical ( red ) , but different from the set for the node @xmath37 ( blue ) . in all panels ,",
    "the computations were generated based on @xmath61 iterations , and for a test radius of @xmath62 . _ _ ]    in the simple dual model , the node - wise equi - m sets for the nodes @xmath38 and @xmath39 are identical subsets of the traditional mandelbrot set ( which is the equi - m set for node @xmath37 ) .",
    "[ prop_simple_dual ]    an additional self - drive @xmath63 applied to the output node changes the balance of inputs to @xmath39 , in the following sense :    in the self - drive model , the node - wise equi - m sets of @xmath38 and @xmath39 remain subsets of the standard mandelbrot set , but the equi - m set of @xmath39 is strictly contained in the equi - m set of @xmath38 ( figure  [ node_differences]b ) .",
    "[ prop_self_drive ]    finally , introducing any arbitrary feedback @xmath64 re - couples the behavior of nodes @xmath38 and @xmath39 , producing a common equi - mandelbrod set , largely shrunk from the simple dual version :    in the feedback model with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the node - wise equi - m sets for the nodes @xmath38 and @xmath39 are again identical subsets of the traditional mandelbrot set ( figure  [ node_differences]c ) .",
    "[ prop_feedback ]    for the rest of the section , the term of `` equi - m set '' will be referring to the equi - mandelbrot set of the network , which is the intersection of the three node - specific sets .",
    "we illustrate the equi - m set for the three models and for different levels of cross - talk @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath3 between nodes .    starting with the simple dual input version of the model",
    ", we show in figure  [ dual_input ] the effects of changing the level @xmath40 of talk between the input nodes , on the shape of the equi - m set .",
    "it is not surprising that , in both positive and negative @xmath40 ranges , increasing @xmath65 gradually shrinks the equi - mandelbrot set .",
    "this can be motivated intuitively by the fact that an additional contribution to the node @xmath38 may cause the critical orbit to increase faster in the @xmath38 , and subsequently the @xmath39 components , hence points in the traditional set will no longer be included in the mutants for @xmath66 .    as @xmath40 increases in the positive range , we noticed that the network m sets form nested subsets ( which is not true for the negative range ) , that they remain connected for all values of @xmath40 , and that the hausdorff dimension of the boundary increases with @xmath40 ( in figure  [ dual_input ] , notice an increased wrinkling of the boundary as @xmath40 takes larger positive values , and an increase smoothing as @xmath40 takes negative values with increasing absolute value ) .",
    "perturbations of @xmath40 in the positive range seem to have a much more substantial contribution to the size of the equi - m set , while perturbations of @xmath40 in the negative range have a lesser influence on the size , and affect mostly the region close tot the boundary of the equi - m set , and the boundary topological details .",
    "we will track the same changes in @xmath40 in the other network models , and investigate if this trend is consistent .",

    "decreasing @xmath41 in the negative range produces no alteration of the m sets when @xmath70 .",
    "however , it induces dramatic changes in shape and connectivity when @xmath71 .",
    "if for @xmath72 relatively large , increasing @xmath40 only slightly alters the shape of the set , for small @xmath72 the size of the set is also altered with increasing @xmath40 ( generating smaller and smaller subsets ) , and the complexity of its boundary also seems to increase .",
    "the effects of varying @xmath71 for a fixed value of @xmath41 become more dramatic with decreasing @xmath41 in the negative range .",

    "the panels of figure  [ real_comp ] show the multi - j sets for two different , but close parameters , @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively , both of which are not in the multi - m set .",
    "the figures suggest a disconnected ( although not totally disconnected ) multi - j set in the first case , and a connected multi - j set in the second case .",
    "this implies that in this case the fatou - julia dichotomy fails in its traditional form  and that the statement relating boundedness of the critical orbit with connectedness of the multi - j set does not hold for real networks .",

    "in this paper , we used a combination of analytical and numerical approaches to propose possible extensions of fatou - julia theory to networked complex maps .",
    "we started by showing that , even in networks where all nodes are identical maps , their behavior may not be `` synchronized : '' the node - wise mandelbrot sets may be identical in some cases , which in others they may differ substantially , depending on the coupling pattern .",
    "we then investigated how specific changes in the network hard - wiring trigger different effects on the structure of the network mandelbrot and julia sets , focusing in particular on observing topological properties ( connectivity ) and fractal behavior ( haussdorff dimension ) .",
    "we found instances in which small perturbations in the strength of one single connection may lead to dramatic topological changes in the asymptotic sets , and instances in which these sets are robust to much more significant changes .",
    "more generally , our paper suggests a new direction of study , with potentially tractable , although complex mathematical questions .",
    "while existing results do not apply to networks in their traditional form , it appears that connectivity of the newly defined uni - julia sets may still be determined by the behavior of the critical orbit .",
    "we conjectured a weaker extension of the fatou - julia theorem , which was based only on numerical inspection , and which remains subject to a rigorous study that would support or refute it .",
    "there are a few interesting aspects which we aim to address in our future work on iterated networks .",
    "for example , we are interested in studying the structure of equi - m and uni - j sets for larger networks , and in understanding the connection between the network architecture and its asymptotic dynamics",

    "the authors previous work has addressed some of these aspects in the context of continuous dynamics and coupled differential equations . however , when translating network architectural patters into network dynamics , the great difficulty arises from a combination of the graph complexity and the system s intractable dynamic richness .",
    "addressing the question at the level of low - dimensional networks can help us more easily identify and pair specific structural patterns to their effects on dynamics , and thus better understand this dependence .",
    "the next natural step is to return to the search for a similar classification in high - dimensional networks , where specific graph measures or patters ( e.g. node - degree distribution , graph laplacian , presence of strong components , cycles or motifs ) may help us , independently or in combination , classify the network s dynamic behavior .    *",
