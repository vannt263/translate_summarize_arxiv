    "dislocations always proliferate and all correlations are expected to decay exponentially ; no analytic treatment is possible in this strong coupling regime . as we will discuss below , current experiments on the cuprates are in a regime dominated by dislocations , and there does not appear to be any significant regime of applicability of the defect - free theory .",

    "<S> we discuss the effects of quenched disorder on a model of charge density wave ( cdw ) ordering on the square lattice . our model may be applicable to the cuprate superconductors , where a random electrostatic potential exists in the cuo@xmath0 planes as a result of the presence of charged dopants . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the presence of a random potential can affect the unidirectionality of the cdw order , characterized by an ising order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> coupling to a unidirectional cdw , the random potential can lead to the formation of domains with 90 degree relative orientation , thus tending to restore the rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the correlation length of the ising order can be significantly larger than the cdw correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> for a checkerboard cdw on the other hand , disorder generates spatial anisotropies on short length scales and thus some degree of unidirectionality . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify these disorder effects and suggest new techniques for analyzing the local density of states ( ldos ) data measured in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments . </S>"
