    "[ fig_06 ] when considering another possible particular case with @xmath240 .",
    "altogether , it could be concluded that the quantum spin system placed on the linear - elastic lattice is responsible for the deviations from hooke s law , i.e. , the extension ( or contraction ) of the lattice is not linearly proportional to the applied pressure not because of anharmonicity of the lattice but owing to a critical behavior of interacting quantum spins placed on its sites .",
    "finally , let us turn our attention to the inverse compressibility @xmath133 shown in the main panels in figs .",

    "moreover , the quantum critical point is shifted towards higher pressures with increasing a relative strength of the ising interaction in the particular case with @xmath241 , whereas the opposite trend ( i.e. , a shift towards lower pressures ) can be observed in the particular case with @xmath242 .",
    "obviously , the effect of the introduced dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction does not fundamentally affects the physical picture we drew except that the relevant shift of quantum critical point due to the same change of the ising interaction becomes much more pronounced as it can be seen from a comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig_06 ] and [ fig_07 ] .",

    "deformable spin lattices are often discussed in theoretical studies of , e.g. , magnetic@xcite or hydrogen - bonded ferro-/antiferroelectric@xcite compounds . however , in those studies various approximations are used which may mask detailed effect of spin - lattice coupling . in the present work ,",
    "we have followed rigorously how lattice elastic constant manifests peculiarities of the spin system in the ground state driven by varying of an external field or pressure .",
