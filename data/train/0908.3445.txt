    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) have elliptical morphologies and generally do not host significant star formation .",
    "however , a subset of bcgs are marked by their cuspy x - ray emission @xcite and a high incidence of strong nebular line emission , which indicates star formation or nuclear activity .",
    "the intracluster gas in these cool - core clusters is thought to be condensing in the form of a `` cooling flow '' @xcite .",
    "many such clusters have blue continua and star formation rates ( sfrs ) as high as @xmath0 , suggesting that the star formation is fueled by the cooling flows .",
    "recent x - ray spectroscopy has demonstrated that cooling flows are subject to regulatory heating , probably associated with nuclear activity @xcite .",
    "the estimated net rates at which gas cools below 1 kev are comparable with the estimated star formation rates @xcite .",
    "cool - core clusters present a prime opportunity to test models of the cooling and energy feedback mechanisms that are thought to dominate early galaxy formation .",
    "radio observations of co emission and near - infrared detections of the ro - vibrational transitions of h@xmath1 have revealed large reservoirs of cool molecular gas in many cooling flows @xcite .",
    "furthermore , far - infrared photometry with the _ spitzer _ space telescope shows that some bcgs in cool - core clusters have spectral energy distributions consistent with emission from cool dust ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "there are similarities between classic starbursts @xcite and bcgs in cool - core clusters , but many questions about star formation in the bcgs remain .",
    "we use _ spitzer _ to study nine bcgs in cool - core clusters which have been extensively observed in x - ray , optical and ultraviolet light . with one exception , our targets",
    "are confirmed star - formers with optical and uv continuum - based sfrs ranging up to @xmath3 .",
    "the mid - infrared ( mir ) band contains many diagnostics of star formation , including emission by small warm dust grains and complex emission by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "it also contains many narrow emission features , including atomic emission associated with nuclear activity and emission lines from molecular hydrogen in pure rotational states .",
    "our goal is to establish a better understanding of the cooling flow , feedback and star formation processes in bcgs .",
    "the spectra in figure 1 were taken with the four low - resolution modes of _ spitzer s _ infrared spectrograph under program i d s 3384 and 20345 .",
    "our targets are abell 1068 , abell 1835 , pks0745 - 19 , hydra a , abell 1795 , abell 2597 , abell 478 , zwcl 1370 , and 2a0335 + 096 .",
    "we obtained sparse spectral maps of all bcgs , but we restrict our current discussion to a central extraction that yielded the best signal - to - noise . after subtracting background light and correcting to the restframe of each bcg",
    ", we renormalized each spectrum to the total light from the target , using the light profile along the sl1 slit and assuming circular symmetry .",
    "the resulting spectra are compared to a typical starburst template spectrum @xcite in figure 1 . despite the high sfrs derived from optical and uv data ,",
    "most of our bcgs differ from normal starbursts in one or more of the following characteristics : weaker long - wave continua , weaker pah features , and strong h@xmath1 features .",
    "the pure rotational lines of h@xmath1 are abnormally strong in our spectra . from the line strengths ,",
    "we infer a range of gas masses at different temperatures , similar to results discussed by @xcite .",
    "the strong h@xmath1 features probably originate in cold gas reservoirs subject to shocks @xcite and are probably unrelated to star formation .",
    "we will discuss the quantitative interpretation of the h@xmath1 and other features in an ensuing paper .    of our nine galaxies , only a1835 has the mir spectral morphology of a classic starburst .",
    "while two others exhibit the expected strong red continuum , they also have anomalous emission feature spectra .",
    "the remaining six spectra have weak red continua , despite a firm lower limit on star formation established for five of them by optical and ultraviolet observations .",
    "the well - established correlations between ir output and star formation @xcite break down .",
    "we have established that if the normal mir continuum signatures of star formation were present in these galaxies , we would have easily detected them ; instead , in most of our targets , the mir continuum is subluminous by factors of 10 - 70x .",
    "the abnormally weak mir continua indicate anomalies in the amount of dust , in its grain size or composition , or in its spatial or temperature distribution .",
    "our results may indicate that star formation in bcgs in cool - core clusters is progressing in an unusual environment . rather than occurring in a dense , disk - like volume , as in normal starbursts",
    ", star formation may be concentrated in extended regions outside the main body of the galaxy , such as at the interface between relativistic jets from the agn and the inner cooling flow .",
    "one example is ngc 1275 , where star formation occurs in a huge filamentary network @xcite . in this unusual environment",
    ", the dust grain population is expected to differ considerably from the dust in normal starbursts and spiral disks .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through two awards issued by jpl / caltech ."
