    "a large amount of experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to studying the unusual properties of high temperature cuprate superconductors in the past thirty years @xcite .",
    "although some consensuses have been reached , many fundamental problems are still in debate , including the microscopic pairing mechanism @xcite , the origin of pseudogap @xcite , and the description of non - fermi liquid behaviors of the normal state @xcite . in the past decade , there have been accumulating experimental evidences for the existence of a strong anisotropy in many of the physical properties of yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( ybco ) @xcite and bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath8 ( bscco ) @xcite .",
    "such an anisotropy is widely believed to be driven by the formation of a novel electronic nematic order @xcite , which spontaneously breaks the @xmath9 symmetry down to a @xmath10 symmetry . in case",
    "the nematic transition line goes across the superconducting transition line and penetrates into the superconducting dome , there exists a zero - temperature nematic quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the nematic quantum phase transition and the associated quantum critical behaviors have been investigated extensively in recent years @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective , there are two widely studied scenarios to induce an electronic nematic order .",
    "first , the nematic order can be generated by melting a stripe order that spontaneously breaks both translational and rotational symmetry @xcite .",
    "the other way is related to pomeranchuk instability which refers to the deformation of the shape of the fermi surface of a metal due to coulomb interaction @xcite . in the simplest case , pomeranchuk instability occurs when the circular fermi surface of a two - dimensional metal becomes ellipse - like via quadrupolar distortion . @xcite . the hubbard model defined on square lattices",
    "@xcite provides a pertinent platform to investigate the electronic nematic order .",
    "halboth and metzner @xcite studied a two - dimensional hubbard model using functional renormalization group ( rg ) method , and revealed pomeranchuk instability and nematic order .",
    "more recently , the square lattice hubbard model is studied by variational cluster approximation @xcite and found to display a local nematic phase under certain circumstances , which might be applied to understand the intra - unit - cell electronic nematicity observed in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements by lawler _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "another context of studying nematic order is provided by the superconducting dome of cuprate superconductors . for a pure @xmath0-wave superconductor ,",
    "the discrete @xmath11 symmetry is preserved . however , when superconductivity coexists with a nematic order , the gap nodes are shifted from their original positions and the @xmath11 symmetry is broken down to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "such an anisotropic superconducting state is physically equivalent to a @xmath13-wave superdconducting state @xcite . at the nematic qcp , the massless fermions excited from the @xmath14-wave gap nodes couple strongly to the quantum critical fluctuation of nematic order parameter , which can be effectively described by a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional field theory @xcite .",
    "this model was first analyzed by vojta _",
    "@xcite , who made an @xmath15-expansion and argued that the nematic phase transition is turned to first order .",
    "@xcite later tackled the same model by means of @xmath16-expansion , where @xmath17 is a large fermion flavor , and concluded that the transition remains continuous .",
    "huh and sachdev @xcite performed a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis , and showed that the fermion velocity ratio @xmath18 in the lowest energy limit , where @xmath19 is the fermi velocity of nodal fermions and @xmath20 the gap velocity @xcite .",
    "the unusual velocity renormalization leads to significant changes of a number of quantities , including density of states ( dos ) @xcite , specific heat @xcite , low-@xmath21 thermal conductivity @xcite , superfluid density @xcite , and london penetration depth @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we revisit the issue of unusual physical properties caused by the strong interaction between massless nodal fermions and critical nematic fluctuation .",
    "we will apply the powerful rg approach to calculate the fermion damping rate @xmath1 , where @xmath22 is the imaginary part of retarded fermion self - energy , and the corresponding quasiparticle residue @xmath23 .",
    "_ @xcite have previously computed the fermion self - energy and spectral function .",
    "interestingly , it will become clear below that the rg analysis give rise to different results once the singular renormalization of fermion velocities is taken into account .",
    "in particular , we will show that the fermion damping rate vanishes upon approaching the fermi level more rapidly than the energy @xmath2 , namely @xmath24 . according to the conventional notion of quantum many - particle physics",
    ", one would expect the system to behave as a normal fermi liquid .",
    "however , by analyzing the rg results , we find that the quasiparticle residue vanishes , i.e. , @xmath25 , in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the system is actually a non - fermi liquid that represents an even weaker violation of fermi liquid theory comparing to a marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) . to the best of our knowledge , this type of unconventional non - fermi liquid behavior has not been reported previously .    in realistic materials , there are always certain amount of disorders , which may play an important role . as demonstrated earlier by nersesyan _",
    "@xcite , the most important disorder in cuprates behaves like a randomly distributed gauge potential .",
    "thus , we will mainly study the influence of random gauge potential on the physical properties of nodal fermions and also the stability of nematic qcp . in the absence of nematic order ,",
    "the coupling between nodal fermions and random gauge potential has attracted considerable interest @xcite . here",
    ", we consider the case in which nodal fermions couple to both the nematic order and random gauge potential , and then study the interplay of these two interactions by means of rg method .",
    "we find that the effective strength of gauge potential disorders tends to diverge at the lowest energy .",
    "this behavior signals the emergence of a finite zero - energy dos @xmath26 and the happening of quantum phase transition from an unconventional non - fermi liquid to a disorder dominated diffusive state .",
    "the nodal fermions acquire a finite scattering rate @xmath27 , which in turn affects the thermodynamic and spectral behaviors of nodal fermions .",
    "the rg results for the self - energy of nodal fermions can be used to understand a number of experimental facts observed in cuprate superconductors .",
    "we will show that the rg results are qualitatively consistent with some recent measurements of specific heat , fermion damping rate , and temperature dependence of fermion velocities .",
    "the rest of the paper will be organized as follows .",
    "we first present the effective low - energy field theory for the interaction between nematic order and nodal fermions in section  [ sec : modelderivation ] .",
    "the random gauge potential is also introduced in this section . in section  [ sec : rganalysisclean ] , we make detailed theoretical analysis for the self - consistent rg equations of the fermion velocities in the clean case .",
    "based on the rg solutions , we proceed to compute the fermion damping rate , quasiparticle residue , and other physical quantities .",
    "we will show that the quantum critical fluctuation of nematic order leads to unconventional non - fermi liquid behaviors of nodal fermions .",
    "we consider the influence of random gauge potential in section  [ sec : rganalysisdisorder ] and find that the effective disorder strength flows to the strong coupling regime at low energies .",
    "therefore , even weak disorders play a significant role and drive the system to enter into a disorder controlled diffusive state . in section  [ sec : compaisionexperiments ] , we discuss the possible application of the rg results to some experimental findings of cuprates . in section  [ sec : summary ] , we briefly summarize our main results .",

    "moreover , @xmath52 is the quartic self - interaction strength .",
    "the nematic order couples to fermions via a yukawa - coupling term @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the coupling constant .",

    "it will be shown below that @xmath79 flows to strong coupling at large @xmath75 , leading to remarkable physical properties .",
    "it is well established that conventional metals can be described by the standard fermi liquid theory , which states that the fermionic excitations of a normal fermi liquid must have a sufficiently long lifetime and exhibit a sharp quasiparticle peak in their spectral peak despite the existence of coulomb interaction @xcite . the conventional notion is that the fermionic quasiparticles constitute a normal fermi liquid if their zero-@xmath21 damping rate @xmath1 vanishes more rapidly than @xmath2 in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "this criterion can be mathematically expressed as @xmath82 another criterion to identify normal fermi liquid is to define an important quantity : the quasiparticle residue , also called renormalization factor , @xmath23 .",

    "this sort of unconventional non - fermi liquid state has not been reported previously .",
    "it is now interesting to compare this unconventional non - fermi liquid state with graphene . in graphene",
    ", early perturbative calculations revealed that dirac fermions exhibit mfl behavior with damping rate @xmath136 and vanishing @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , subsequent careful rg studies @xcite have found that , the fermion damping rate actually depends on energy as @xmath137 at zero temperature due to the long - range coulomb interaction , whereas the corresponding @xmath118 flows to a finite value as @xmath138 . therefore , graphene is a normal fermi liquid .",
    "in contrast , the massless nodal fermions constitute a non - fermi liquid at the nematic qcp , because @xmath118 vanishes in the lowest energy limit . the crucial difference between these two cases",
    "can be understood as follows . at nematic qcp ,",
    "the fermion velocities are driven to vanish by the nematic order , so the effective fermion - nematic interaction is significantly pronounced . in graphene , however , the fermion velocity is dramatically enhanced at low energies by coulomb interaction , which then weakens the effective coulomb interaction and guarantees the validity of the fermi liquid description .",
    "these two interacting dirac fermion systems provide interesting new insight on the effects of strong electron correlations and also on the criterion of non - fermi liquid states .",
    "moreover , an important lesson one can learn from the research experience of graphene is that , rg may lead to qualitatively different spectral properties of fermions from that obtained by ordinary perturbative expansion approach . indeed , this is the main motivation that has promoted us to make an extensive rg analysis of the spectral properties of nodal fermions at the nematic qcp .     in the clean limit at different initial values",

    "since the solutions of the rg equations about dos and specific heat are modified substantially in the disordered case , it turns out that random gauge potential is a relevant perturbation in the present system . to verify the relevance of random gauge potential",
    ", we should appeal to the rg analysis of the effective disorder strength .    in the action term @xmath174 given in equation ( [ eq : actiondisorder ] ) ,",
    "the parameters that characterize the fermion - disorder coupling seem to be @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "it can be seen from the rg equations that @xmath175 flows in precisely the same way as @xmath19 , and that @xmath176 as @xmath20 .",
    "thus , both @xmath175 and @xmath176 are strongly renormalized and driven to vanish as @xmath101 .",
    "however , this does not mean that the disorders can be simply neglected . indeed , whether disorders are important is determined by the ratio between the interaction energy given by @xmath174 and the fermion energy @xmath177 .",
    "we can see that this ratio is defined by @xmath79 , which enters into the rg equations for the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 .",
    "the effective strength of random gauge potential should be measured by @xmath79 , rather than @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",

    ", @xmath60 is assumed to be a dimensionless constant , but the other four parameters flow strongly with the varying @xmath75 .",
    "detailed rg analysis revealed that @xmath168 goes to infinity , namely @xmath178 in the limit @xmath113 as a consequence of the singular renormalization of the fermion velocities ratio @xmath96 .",
    "more quantitatively , the large scale behavior of @xmath79 can be described by @xmath179 where @xmath180 .",
    "it is necessary to explain here why the effective strength of random gauge potential should be represented by @xmath79 , rather than solely by the coefficients @xmath80 with @xmath181 , and why @xmath182 in the lowest energy limit . in an interacting fermion system ,",
    "the effective strength of the interaction is characterized by the ratio between the interaction energy scale and the kinetic energy of fermions .",
    "this ratio is widely used in condensed matter physics to judge whether an interacting fermion system can be defined as a strongly correlated system or not .",
    "for instance , the normal metal with a high density of itinerant electrons is believed to be a weakly interacting system since the energy scale of coulomb potential is much smaller than the fermi energy . in a massless dirac fermion system",
    "( such as graphene ) , the effective strength of long - range coulomb interaction is defined as @xmath183 , where @xmath184 appears in the action of the coulomb interaction as a coupling coefficient and the fermion velocity @xmath19 reflects the order of the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "another example comes from the effective bcs model of dirac fermion systems , where the effective strength of pairing interaction is characterized by @xmath185 with @xmath186 being the coupling coefficient of pairing interaction and @xmath19 fermion velocity @xcite .",
    "this criterion also applies to disordered systems . when massless dirac fermions couple to random gauge potential , the effective strength of random gauge potential should be defined by @xmath187 , rather than the coefficient of fermion - disorder coupling @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath80 flows to zero in the lowest energy limit , @xmath79 does not necessarily vanish since there is a possibility that @xmath19 and @xmath20 may vanish more ( or equally ) rapidly than @xmath80 .",
    "when the nodal fermions couple to both the quantum fluctuation of nematic order and random gauge potential , the four parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 all flow to zero in the lowest energy limit , but the effective strength of random gauge potential becomes very large , namely @xmath188 .",
    "this originates from the fact that @xmath189 and @xmath190 are constants , while at the same time the velocity ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the behavior @xmath191 at low energies indicates that random gauge potential is relevant .",
    "to see this point , we neglect the nematic order and consider only the coupling of nodal fermions to random gauge potential , which results in simplified rg equations : @xmath192 using the two relations @xmath193 and @xmath194 , it is easy to show that @xmath195 in this case , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 depend on length scale @xmath75 as @xmath196 which all vanish rapidly in the limit @xmath197 .",
    "since @xmath79 is a constant , random gauge potential is marginal . from the above calculations",
    ", we can conclude that the behavior @xmath182 obtained in the presence of both nematic fluctuation and random gauge potential is directly related to the extreme velocity anisotropy @xmath18 induced by the quantum fluctuation of nematic order .",
    "the flow of @xmath79 towards strong coupling regime is a clear signature that random gauge potential should have substantial physical effects on the low - energy behaviors of nodal fermions , which will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we notice other interesting correlated electron models in which the coupling coefficient of an interaction vanishes at low energies , but the interaction is not negligible due to the more ( or equally ) rapid decrease of the kinetic energy of electrons .",
    "recently , sur and lee studied the influence of quantum fluctuations of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) order at an af quantum critical point in a metal supporting one - dimensional fermi surface @xcite .",
    "in particular , they showed that the coupling coefficient of the interaction flows to zero at low energies .",
    "however , the fermion velocity also vanishes , thus the interaction can not be simply neglected .",
    "actually , sur and lee found that the interaction drives the system to become a so - called quasi - local strange metal that is apparently qualitatively different from the free fermion system .",
    "how should we understand the divergence of @xmath79 ? in order to answer this question , we first consider the non - interacting system that contains only nodal fermions and random gauge potential . in this case , the rg equation of fermion dos becomes @xmath198 with @xmath199 if @xmath200 , we have @xmath201 where @xmath151 satisfies @xmath202 .",
    "in this case , the rg equation for specific heat is given by @xmath203 the solution of this equation is given by @xmath204 if @xmath205 , it is easy to get @xmath206 in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "the divergence @xmath142 indicates the emergence of a disorder dominated diffusive state , in which a finite disorder scattering rate @xmath27 and a finite zero - energy dos @xmath26 are generated @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath207 defines a qcp for the quantum phase transition between the ballistic and diffusive states of nodal fermions .",

    "although the perturbative rg method provides a powerful tool to judge whether and when a phase transition takes place , it can not be used to compute the precise value of @xmath27 . to calculate @xmath27 , one usually needs to construct a self - consistent equation for the retarded fermion self - energy by properly considering both the fermion - disorder scattering and the influence of quantum critical fluctuation of nematic order @xcite",
    "this is an interesting yet complicated issue , which is beyond the scope of the present work and subjected to future research . here",

    "the magnitude of @xmath27 should be an increasing function of @xmath210 . in the following calculations of @xmath26 and @xmath161",

    "the diffusive motion of nodal fermions and its interplay with critical nematic fluctuation govern the low - energy properties of the system .",
    "once a finite @xmath27 is generated , the renormalized velocities @xmath19 and @xmath20 no more vanish at low energies , which is apparently different from the clean case . instead , as the energy scale decreases , both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are saturated to certain finite values , denoted by @xmath215 and @xmath216 , below the energy scale set by @xmath27 .",
    "hence , there is no extreme velocity anisotropy in the diffusive state .",
    "the fermion dos and specific heat also exhibit different behaviors comparing to the clean case .",

    "suppose the system stays at a distance @xmath50 to the qcp , the rg results are still valid and the fermion velocity ratio is still renormalized at energies higher than the scale corresponding to @xmath50 .",

    "there is , however , an unexpected experimental finding @xcite that the residual specific heat of ybco is obviously larger in magnitude than that of la@xmath231sr@xmath232cuo@xmath233 ( lsco ) , although the former material is known to be cleaner than the latter .",
    "apparently , disorder scattering alone is not capable of accounting for this experimental fact .",
    "recently , coexistence of @xmath228-wave superconductivity with a loop current order was proposed to give a possible explanation @xcite for the large residual linear-@xmath21 term of specific heat in ybco . in this scenario , when @xmath228-wave superconductivity coexists with a loop current order , two of four nodal points are converted to finite fermi pockets of bougoliubov quasiparticles , which then generates a finite @xmath26 and a residual linear-@xmath21 term of specific heat @xcite .",
    "the recent ultrasound measurements showed the possible evidence for the existence of loop current order in ybco@xcite .    here",
    "we propose an alternative explanation for the above anomalous experimental results of residual specific heat .",
    "our rg analysis found that the effective strength of random gauge potential , being the most relevant disorder to cuprates @xcite , is strongly enhanced by the critical nematic fluctuation , which in turn increases the residual value of the specific heat . to understand the role of quantum nematic fluctuation , we firstly consider only the coupling of nodal fermions to random gauge potential . in this special case , @xmath79 does not flow and thus remains a constant , namely @xmath234 .",
    "if @xmath208 is very small , which means the system is only slightly disordered , the behavior of @xmath142 and specific heat would be governed by equations ( [ eq : dosonlydisorder ] ) and ( [ eq : specificheatonlydisorder ] ) , respectively . in this case , the system does not develop a finite @xmath26 and there is no residual liner-@xmath21 term of specific heat .",

    "this implies that a cleaner compound might acquire a larger amount of @xmath27 and naturally a larger @xmath26 .    to make a more careful comparison between theories and experiments",

    "a number of recent experiments provided strong evidence supporting the existence of nematic order in ybco , whereas there is little evidence for nematicity in lsco .",
    "although ybco is cleaner than lsco , the quantum fluctuation of nematic order in the former superconductor can drive @xmath79 to flow to much larger values . as a consequence ,",
    "the residual linear - in-@xmath21 term of specific heat of ybco would be larger than that of lsco .",
    "we emphasize that , disorder itself can not explain the anomalous behaviors of the residual specific heat observed in ybco and lsco , and it is necessary to consider the interplay of quantum nematic fluctuation and random gauge potential .    for the above elaboration , we know that the roles played by the quantum nematic fluctuation and random gauge potential depends on doping @xmath236 . to simplify discussion",

    "this doping dependence is observable , and can be examined by experiments . within the loop current order scenario ,",

    ". therefore , the singular renormalization of fermion velocities of nodal fermions induced by the quantum fluctuation of namatic order , which is first discovered by huh and sachdev @xcite , agrees with the @xmath21-dependence of @xmath19 observed in reference @xcite .",

    "therefore , even a weak random gauge potential can drive a quantum phase transition from a unconventional non - fermi liquid state to a disorder dominated diffusive state .",
    "however , the unusual fermion damping induced by the nematic order is more important than the disorder scattering at high temperatures , where the nodal fermions still display the unconventional non - fermi liquid behaviors .",

    "the latter kinetic energy is smaller that the former for the same given values of momenta , which indicates that the interaction plays a more important role in the latter system than the former . to further demonstrate this difference",

    "once again , we see that the ratio between the interaction energy scale and the kinetic energy is a crucial quantity to determine the low - energy behaviors of an interacting fermion system .",
    "the coupling of nodal fermions to the quantum fluctuation of antiferromagnetic ( af ) order is also an interesting problem @xcite .",
