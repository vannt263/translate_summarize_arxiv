    "color superconductivity is a possible phase of high density qcd , pioneered by bailin and love and others , @xcite , who pointed out that the @xmath4 channel of a di - quark interaction is attractive through one gluon exchange .",
    "recently , using an effective four - fermion interaction in the superconducting phase , much work has been carried out on examining an energetically favored condensate which , for @xmath5 , breaks the original @xmath6 symmetry to its diagonal symmetry @xcite . this color superconductivity mechanism has been called color - flavor locking .",
    "several attempts have been made to determine the parameters of the superphase from the qcd action . in all cases",
    "one arrives at the same dependence of the zero - temperature gap energy on the qcd running coupling constant evaluated at the fermi energy , namely @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the chemical potential and @xmath1 the running yang - mills coupling evaluated at @xmath8 .",
    "this dependence upon the coupling differs significantly from the bcs case , @xmath9 , due to the long range propagation of magnetic gluons .",
    "the coefficient @xmath10 was first derived by son @xcite , and subsequently verified in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter two of these generalized this scaling behavior to the transition temperature and in addition derived its ratio to the zero temperature gap .",
    "all of these results were obtained from superconducting gap equations with one gluon exchange . as such , although they contain the correct leading order behaviour that determines the dependence of the gap on the coupling , more detailed calculations are required to recover all the leading order contributions to the pre - exponential factor .",
    "in contrast with previous works , we approach the transition temperature from the normal phase , with @xmath11 .",
    "there are several advantages with this approach .",
    "first of all , the propagators in the normal phase are not subjected to modifications from the long range order , the form of which are ansatz dependent .",
    "this ensures that issues of gauge invariance and higher order corrections are relatively simple to handle .",
    "secondly , the integral equation for the proper vertex function , which determines the pairing instability , is linear while the gap equation in the superphase is nonlinear .",
    "thirdly , the hard dense loop contribution to the gluon propagator is free from the meissner effect .",
    "though it has not been taken into account so far in the gap equation calculations in the superphase , the meissner effect is nevertheless expected to alter the pre - exponential factor @xcite .",
    "working directly from the qcd lagrangian provides a natural framework within which to examine the perturbative nature of the theory at high density .",
    "indeed , we shall find that interactions of second order , @xmath12 , make a leading order contribution to the pre - exponential factor and that all higher order contributions are subleading .",
    "the sum of these effects suggests that a derivation of the transition temperature from the normal phase will not only provide a rigorous verification of the results obtained from within the superphase , but should also allow a clean and exact determination of the pre - exponential factor .",
    "combined with the aesthetic benefit of calculating directly from the qcd lagrangian , this more than compensates for the technical complexity of this approach .",
    "starting from the @xmath13 qcd lagrangian , the calculation of the transition temperature can be cast easily into thermal diagrams with gauge invariance manifest . following the formulation developed by gorkov and melik - barkhudarov for",
    "the non - relativistic fermi - gas , @xcite , which allows for a systematic examination of the higher order contributions , we calculate the transition temperature to leading order in coupling and obtain @xmath14 where up to a constant of @xmath3 , @xmath15 , in agreement with @xcite , and the exponent , @xmath16 , in agreement with @xcite , are determined by the leading order one gluon exchange process .",
    "the previously unreported factor @xmath17\\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq&0.1766\\qquad\\hbox{for $ n=3$},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comes from the logarithmic suppression of the quasi - particle weight in the dressed quark propagator . for landau",
    "damping , obtained in the hard dense loop approximation , the contribution to the prefactor from two gluon exchange diagrams is subleading in @xmath1 .",
    "this , however , is not the case for a hypothetical static screening case where the perturbative nature is completely spoiled by infrared log - enhancement in higher orders .",
    "we consider an @xmath13 color gauge field coupled to @xmath18 flavors of massless quarks with the lagrangian density @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 the @xmath13 generator in its fundamental representation .",
    "since the lagrangian ( [ eq : qcd ] ) is diagonal with respect to both flavor and chirality , the corresponding indices will be dropped below .",
    "we derive the transition temperature by investigating the onset of the pairing instability in the proper vertex function corresponding to the scattering of two quarks at non - zero temperature and chemical potential .",
    "this vertex function with zero total momentum and zero total matsubara energy , @xmath23 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 label the matsubara energies @xmath26 of individual quarks .",
    "each of the superscripts @xmath27 , which denote color , are associated with a leg .",
    "the subscripts @xmath28 , which label the states above or below the dirac sea , are either @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "we find it convenient for the partial wave analysis to associate the dirac spinors @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which satisfy the dirac equations @xmath33 and @xmath34 , to the quark - gluon vertex instead of to the quark propagator .",
    "therefore , where @xmath35 represents the incoming subscripts and @xmath36 represents the outgoing subscripts , suppressing the color indices and momentum - energy dependence , we write @xmath37 the vertex function @xmath38 is given by conventional feynman rules , and @xmath39 or @xmath40 for @xmath41 or @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the proper vertex function satisfies a dyson - schwinger equation as shown in fig .",
    "this integral equation of fredholm type may be written with all indices suppressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the two quark irreducible vertex with all indices defined in the same way as for @xmath44 .",
    "the kernel has the explicit form @xmath45 where we write @xmath46 for the full quark propagator with momentum @xmath47 and matsubara energy @xmath48 .",
    "the zeroth order quark propagator reads @xmath49 and the diagrammatic expansion of @xmath43 to @xmath12 is displayed in fig .",
    ".    the transition temperature may be obtained from ( [ eq : ie ] ) by examining the fredholm determinant , @xmath50 , which is a function of @xmath51 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath0 is then given by the highest temperature at which @xmath52 vanishes . to demonstrate the gauge invariance of this formulation , we need to extend the integral equation ( [ eq : ie ] ) to include scattering with arbitrary total momentum and energy .",
    "denote by @xmath53 the kernel for which either the total momentum or the total energy or both are nonzero . then the fredholm determinant with arbitrary total momentum and energy factorizes as @xmath54 on the other hand , @xmath55 is given by the sum of bubble diagrams shown in fig .",
    "they are in fact manifestly gauge invariant as may be seen following the argument given in @xcite .    for the rest of this paper",
    ", we shall work in coulomb gauge , in which the full gluon propagator takes the form @xmath56    since @xmath44 corresponds to di - quark scattering it can be decomposed into irreducible representations of @xmath13 by either symmetrization [ representation * 6 * for @xmath57 or antisymmetrization [ representation @xmath4 for @xmath57 among the initial and final color indices ,",

    "@xmath43 may be decomposed similarly .",
    "since the fermi surface has a pairing instability in the presence of even an arbitrarily weak attractive interaction , as is also the case for bcs theory , we need only focus on the attractive antisymmetric channel for non - abelian theories . both @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be expanded in terms of legendre polynomials , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath63 substituting such expansions into ( [ eq : ie ] ) , we find another fredholm equation satisfied by @xmath64 : @xmath65 where the kernel @xmath66 has the form @xmath67 we consider the @xmath68 term in the partial wave expansion , although the higher partial wave terms may contribute @xcite .",
    "the fredholm determinant of ( [ eq:7 ] ) with @xmath68 can be written as @xmath69 with @xmath70 the eigenvalues ( labeled by the integer suffix @xmath71 ) defined by the homogeneous equation , @xmath72 at sufficiently high temperature , all @xmath73 , so that @xmath74 and there is no instability  the theory is in the normal phase . as the temperature is reduced , we find the transition temperature to the superconducting phase is that at which the smallest of @xmath75 reaches one .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : hint ] ) provides the eigenvalues in terms of the parameters of the theory ; the temperature , coupling and chemical potential .",
    "hence the inversion of @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the smallest eigenvalue , yields the transition temperature @xmath78 . in the presence of a fermi sea ,",
    "hard dense loops have to be included in the gluon propagator . as a result",
    ", the coulomb interaction is strongly screened by the debye length , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 the dressed coulomb propagator at momentum - energy @xmath81 reads @xmath82 with @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "however , the magnetic interaction is poorly screened . while a magnetic mass may exist , of order @xmath51 , landau damping @xcite prevails at @xmath85 . in this case",
    "the propagator for a magnetic gluon is @xmath86 the only region of infrared sensitivity on the @xmath87-plane is @xmath88 where @xmath89 . to @xmath90 order",
    ", the contribution to @xmath91 arises from the one - gluon exchange diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and is given by @xmath92,\\ ] ] where a term finite in the limit @xmath93 has been dropped .",
    "to the leading order of @xmath94 , the summation over matsubara energy can be replaced by an integral and @xmath95 ignored .",
    "furthermore , the components @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be neglected and the integral over @xmath99 can be carried out for a solution smooth in the neighborhood of the fermi sea , @xmath100 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : hint ] ) is then approximated by @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 the reduced kernel @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 with an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath106 introduced .",
    "the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : inteq ] ) can be solved using the same approximation employed by son @xcite , which amounts to replacing the kernel of ( [ eq : inteq ] ) with @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "we find that @xmath109 where @xmath71 is an integer and @xmath110.\\ ] ] setting the smallest eigenvalue to one , namely @xmath111 , we finally arrive at the exponent and the prefactor @xmath27 of ( [ eq : transt ] ) .    here",
    "we wish to highlight the mathematical structure of ( [ eq : ie ] ) which characterizes the long range attractive interaction .",
    "if , instead , the pairing interaction was of a short range nature , the transition temperature could be located by means of the standard expansion of the fredholm determinant @xmath112 the @xmath113 term in the expansion on the right hand side contains @xmath114 kernels folded together and for a short range interaction would be of the order @xmath115 since there is only one eigenvalue of @xmath116 which diverges as @xmath117 in the limit @xmath118 . at the transition temperature",
    "one would have @xmath119 , and thus the order of magnitude of the subsequent terms would be @xmath120",
    ". therefore only the first two non - trivial terms ( @xmath121 ) would be sufficient to determine the transition temperature up to the leading order of the pre - exponential factor .",
    "on the other hand , for the present long range attraction of the qcd model , the logarithm in the kernel of ( [ eq : hint ] ) makes the @xmath113 term of the expansion ( [ eq : fd ] ) of the order @xmath122 since there are now an infinite number of eigenvalues of @xmath116 which diverge as @xmath123 in the limit @xmath118 , as indicated in ( [ eq : evals ] ) .",
    "hence the series can not be truncated at @xmath0 , and a new method has to be employed to fix both the exponent and the prefactor .",
    "note that the second term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : fd ] ) is in fact logarithmically infinite for the kernel ( [ kernel ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", this term corresponds to the sum @xmath124 which is convergent according to ( [ eq : evals ] ) .",
    "the reason for this apparent paradox lies in son s approximation , which led to the eigenvalues given in ( [ eq : evals ] ) .",
    "when the approximation is corrected , the eigenvalues instead become @xmath125,\\ ] ] with @xmath126 for @xmath127 @xcite , which explains the appearance of the logarithmic divergence in this term when summing over @xmath71 .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar non - bcs scaling behavior of the type indicated in ( [ eq : nbcs ] ) was obtained via a mean field calculation of 2d superconductivity at the von  hove singularity of the electronic density of states @xcite .",
    "we now come to the question of higher order corrections to the kernel from the perturbative expansion of the quark propagator and the irreducible vertex @xmath43 .",
    "these become important if sufficient powers of the infrared logarithm accompany the coupling constant @xmath90 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : transt ] ) that @xmath128 at the transition temperature .",
    "thus , if the @xmath12 contribution to @xmath129 is of the form @xmath130 or @xmath131 , its magnitude relative to the @xmath132 term given by ( [ eq : gam ] ) will be @xmath133 .",
    "the perturbative robustness of the exponent then requires that @xmath134 ; robustness of the prefactor requires @xmath135 .",
    "we find with landau damping that @xmath136 ; one logarithm originates from the leading order of @xmath137 , ( [ eq : gam ] ) , and the second from the self - energy of quarks @xcite .",
    "therefore there will be an @xmath3 correction to the prefactor .",
    "parametrizing the dressed quark propagator above the dirac sea as @xmath138 we find , to one loop order , that @xmath139 while @xmath140 remains finite in the limit @xmath141 . for a matsubara energy @xmath142",
    ", we thus have @xmath143 following the steps which lead from ( [ eq : cp ] ) to ( [ eq : redk ] ) above , the inclusion of this effect amounts to replacing the reduced kernel @xmath144 by @xmath145 where @xmath146 treating @xmath147 as a perturbation , the shift of the eigenvalue in ( [ eq : evals ] ) with @xmath148 turns out to be @xmath149 the condition for the critical temperature , @xmath150 , now becomes @xmath151 the solution of which , for small @xmath1 , gives rise to the result ( [ eq : transt ] ) with both @xmath27 and @xmath152 .",
    "the logarithmic dependence of ( [ eq:16 ] ) upon the coupling constant @xmath1 , written in @xmath153 , will change the prefactor @xmath154 of ( [ eq : transt ] ) to @xmath155 .",
    "however this correction is of higher order .",
    "other higher order corrections to @xmath137 have also been partially addressed in the literature .",
    "the vertex correction has been discussed in @xcite and some renormalization group arguments have been applied to the straight box diagrams of two gluon exchange , @xcite , which was conjectured to be of the same order as the crossed box diagram . for the case of landau damping , our analysis of the vertex correction is in agreement with @xcite , indicating an @xmath156 contribution to the prefactor .",
    "we also find that the crossed box diagram is free from any logarithmic enhancement and so its contribution is suppressed relative to the one gluon exchange by a factor of @xmath157 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the straight box diagram , which corresponds to the convolution of two single gluon exchange kernels , is logarithmically divergent at @xmath158 and contains all the powers of logarithms at @xmath159 necessary to produce the result of the ladder sum implicit in ( [ eq : hint ] ) .",
    "the crossed box contributes to @xmath160 a term @xmath161 [ \\bar u(-\\vec p\\,')\\gamma_{\\nu^\\prime}s_f(-\\vec p+ \\vec l , i\\omega)\\gamma_{\\mu^\\prime}u(-\\vec p\\,)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and the summation over matsubara energy has been replaced by an integral for @xmath165 . ignoring the coulomb propagator , the contribution from the small scattering angle , @xmath166 , and infrared region , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , @xmath169 [ \\bar u(-\\vec p\\,')\\gamma_{j^\\prime}s_f(-\\vec p+ \\vec l , i\\omega)\\gamma_{i^\\prime}u(-\\vec p\\,)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "therefore @xmath184 as well as @xmath185 is free from infrared divergences .    for the sake of comparison , we have also examined the @xmath12 corrections with only a static mass gap for gluons , @xmath186 .",
    "this amounts to replacing the magnetic gluon propagator ( [ eq : glue ] ) by @xmath187 the integration over the euclidean energy can be carried out readily by the residue theorem and the remaining integral can be classified according to the contributions from the gluon and quark poles . denoting the @xmath12 contribution to @xmath160 by @xmath188",

    "this presence of @xmath199 will ruin the perturbative nature of the formulation , provided @xmath200 . at this point ,",
    "the difference between landau damping and static screening is clear . to the leading order of one gluon exchange ,",
    "the difference merely amounts to the substitution of the static screening mass by @xmath201 , with @xmath202 the euclidean energy transfer and @xmath203 . this is not at all the case for higher order corrections , including two gluon exchange , even though the infra - red sensitive region for the loop momentum of the quark pole contribution in the case of static screening coincides with that of landau damping",
    "in conclusion , we have derived the superconducting transition temperature with thermal diagrams in the normal phase .",
    "this ensures gauge invariance to all orders .",
    "we have also examined systematically the @xmath12 corrections and found an additional contribution to the pre - exponential factor of @xmath78 in the literature . unlike the situations with static screening , landau damping significantly improves",
    "the infra - red behavior of the higher order diagrams and makes the perturbative expansion of the prefactor in terms of @xmath1 legitimate .    in a forthcoming publication @xcite",
    ", we develop a perturbative formulation that enables us to eliminate the @xmath3 uncertainty of the prefactor @xmath27 of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : nbcs ] ) .",
    "since the perturbative expansion is given in terms of @xmath1 or @xmath204 , the application to realistic situations is in fact rather limited .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite , even with asymptotic freedom , @xmath205 at @xmath206mev , and yet the energy scale probed at rhic is only a few hundred mev .",
