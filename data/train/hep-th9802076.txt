    "the chern - simons formulation of 2 + 1 dimensional gravity @xcite has provided many interesting new insights into the problem of quantum gravity .",
    "( for a review see @xcite . )",
    "most notably , making use of the relationship between 2 + 1 dimensional chern - simons theory and the 1 + 1 dimensional wzw model @xcite , carlip has argued for a statistical mechanical interpretation of the entropy of a 2 + 1 dimensional black hole , backed up by a pair of tantalising calculations which yielded the correct value for the black hole entropy , both in lorentzian @xcite , and euclidean @xcite formalisms .",
    "furthermore , the derivation given in @xcite has been recently applied with success to de sitter space @xcite , and may provide a tool for understanding black hole entropy in string theory far from extremality @xcite .",
    "the most important assumption in carlip s analysis is that those degrees of freedom responsible for the black hole entropy are located at the horizon .",
    "this idea is certainly appealing and has been advocated by many authors .",
    "however , at a technical and conceptual level , it is difficult to see what states are counted in carlip s calculation , and what is being held fixed . in principle , it should be possible to count states in a micro - canonical ensemble , holding the mass and spin of the black hole fixed , or to infer the number of states in a grand - canonical ensemble , holding fixed the black hole temperature and angular velocity .    a different approach to understanding the statistical mechanical origin of the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole entropy was recently proposed by strominger @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the basic ingredient is the discovery by brown and henneaux @xcite that the asymptotic symmetry group of 2 + 1 dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant @xcite is the conformal group with a ( classical ) central charge @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the cosmological constant .",
    "note that in the weak coupling limit @xmath2 , @xmath3 becomes very large .",
    "strominger has pointed out that if one counts states by regarding the theory as equivalent to @xmath3 free bosons , then at a fixed value of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the degeneracy of states gives rise to exactly the bekenstein  hawking entropy . since in 2 + 1",
    "dimensions @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the black hole mass and angular momentum @xcite , strominger s computation is clearly a micro - canonical calculation . in this approach",
    "one would like to find the underlying conformal field theory with a central charge equal to ( [ c ] ) , and its connection is to a counting of states at the black hole horizon .",
    "since it is clear that one can not obtain the correct black hole entropy in general by looking only at asymptotic isometries , it seems that strominger s calculation succeeds because the trivial nature of gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions results in an isomorphism between boundary theories at infinity and at the horizon .",
    "this paper has two goals . on the one hand , in sec .",
    "2 we present a micro - canonical calculation of the black hole entropy . starting with a chern - simons theory",
    ", we find the algebra of global charges present at any constant radius boundary surface in the black hole spacetime .",
    "we prove that a subset of this infinite set of conserved charges satisfies the virasoro algebra with a central charge equal to ( [ c ] ) .",
    "this central charge , as in @xcite , arises classically @xcite .",
    "the advantage of considering the chern - simons formulation is that the underlying conformal field theory is , at least at the classical level , an @xmath10 wzw model whose relation to the virasoro generators is via a twisted sugawara construction @xcite .",
    "further , it is possible , to show that this virasoro algebra arises from a reduction of the wzw theory to a liouville theory @xcite .",
    "the counting of black hole microstates then follows just as in @xcite .",
    "as stressed before , since this counting needs @xmath8 and @xmath9 fixed , the relevant states live in a micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "the subset of global charges satisfying the virasoro algebra are shown to be precisely those charges that , at infinity , leave the leading order form of the metric invariant , agreeing with the asymptotic isometries found in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the construction leading to a virasoro algebra of surface deformations is equally valid at any radius , and in particular at the horizon .",
    "thus , we are able to derive the bekenstein  hawking entropy from the algebra of horizon deformations . we give the explicit form of the generators of the virasoro algebra and of the diffeomorphisms that they generate , valid at a boundary surface located at any radius .",
    "our second goal is to find the grand - canonical partition function for the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole . in sec .",
    "3 , we compute the partition function @xmath11 for three dimensional euclidean gravity on a solid torus with a fixed value of the modular parameter @xmath12 of the torus . we show that this parameter is related to the black hole inverse temperature @xmath13 and angular velocity @xmath14 by @xmath15 and therefore @xmath11 is clearly the grand - canonical partition function .",
    "the computation of @xmath11 is not straightforward because the relevant group is @xmath16 which is not compact .",
    "we use here the trick of replacing @xmath17 @xcite and show that the partition function correctly accounts for the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole entropy , after continuing the spin of the @xmath18 representations back to complex values . in this case",
    ", we find the correct answer only if we include a source term at the black hole horizon which has a particularly interesting interpretation in terms of the wzw theory .",
    "it tracks the spin of each representation and is the analogue of a @xmath19 operator in fermionic theories , twisting the wzw theory in the time direction .",
    "in this section we canonically quantise the degrees of freedom associated with the gravitational field , by using the relation between 2 + 1 dimensional gravity and chern - simons theory .",
    "we then relate the kac - moody algebra of the boundary wzw theory that emerges from the chern - simons theory to a virasoro algebra that describes asymptotic isometries of the metric .",
    "this relation , achieved by a twisted sugawara construction , results in a theory whose degeneracy at fixed mass and spin of the black hole leads to the bekenstein  hawking entropy @xcite .",
    "let us begin with some general remarks on chern - simons theory , always motivated by an application to the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole .",
    "consider the chern - simons action @xmath20={k\\over 4\\pi}\\int    \\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho}\\tr \\left(a_\\mu\\partial_\\nu a_\\rho + { 2\\over        3 } a_\\mu a_\\nu a_\\rho\\right)d^3x,\\ ] ] where as we shall see below , we shall be interested in @xmath21 .",
    "up to a boundary term , ( [ a0 ] ) can be put into the canonical form @xmath22={k\\over 4\\pi } \\int_{\\sigma\\times r }   \\varepsilon^{ij } g_{ab } \\left (      a^a_i \\dot a^b_j - a^a_t f^b_{ij}\\right)dt d^2 x , \\ ] ] ( here @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "we take ( [ a1 ] ) , without additional boundary terms , as our starting point .",
    "the variation of this action leads to @xmath25={k\\over 4\\pi}\\int    \\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho}\\tr \\left(\\delta a_\\mu      f_{\\nu\\rho}\\right)d^3x    -{k\\over 2\\pi}\\int_{{\\partial } \\sigma } \\tr a_t \\ , \\delta a_\\phi \\ , , \\ ] ] where we have assumed , in @xmath26 coordinates , that there is a single outer boundary at fixed @xmath27 . in order to make the variation of this action well defined , we choose to fix one or other of the conditions @xmath28 at the boundary ( in the @xmath29 chern - simons theory we will choose @xmath30 )",
    "however , this is not enough to ensure the differentiability of ( [ mm14a ] ) since under ( [ chiral ] ) the boundary term reduces to @xmath31 .",
    "we thus need to imposse the equation @xmath32 or , in other words , we need to fix the value of @xmath33 at the boundary . under ( [ chiral ] ) and ( [ nn1 ] ) the action has well defined variations and",
    "the variational problem is then well posed .",
    "we now analise the meaning of these boundary conditions .",
    "the chirality conditions ( [ chiral ] ) should be regarded as specifying the class of spacetimes or field configurations that will be considered . in terms of lightlike",
    "coordinates @xmath34 these conditions read @xmath35 and it is well known that they are satisfied by the btz black hole solutions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "these conditions leave a large residual symmetry group , namely chiral ( anti chiral ) gauge transformations which are generated by kac - moody fields , and the corresponding boundary degrees of freedom are described by a chiral @xmath36 action . since the black hole is asymptotically anti - de sitter , it is natural to further reduce the boundary theory by imposing polyakov s reduction conditions on the @xmath37 currents leading to an effective liouville theory , as done in @xcite .",
    "we shall mention this possibility in sec .",
    "2.8 , but in this paper we shall mainly consider the full kac - moody theory .",
    "let us finally point out that the chirality boundary conditions ( [ chiral ] ) are not known to be in one to one correspondence with the existence of a black hole , or an event horizon .",
    "the definition of  black holes states \" is a delicate problem which needs some information about the topology as well as local fields .",
    "our strategy here is to consider the chirality conditions , which include the black hole solutions , as a starting point and quantise the theory on that hilbert space .",
    "condition ( [ nn1 ] ) fixes the ensemble to be micro - canonical .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath29 theory , the values of @xmath38 are proportional to linear combinations of the black hole mass and angular momenta .",
    "an alternative procedure would be to add the term @xmath39 to the action ( [ mm14a ] ) and leave its value undetermined .",
    "this corresponds to a canonical ensemble and will be studied in detail in sec .",
    "there will in general also be a boundary variation at any inner boundary , but in the following discussion we shall only consider charges on an outer boundary .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the algebra of gauge constraints leads to a set of global charges at the boundary whose poisson bracket algebra is a classical kac - moody algebra .",
    "these global charges are equivalent to the global charges obtained by a reduction of the chern - simons theory to a boundary wzw theory .    from the point of view of the three dimensional theory in hamiltonian form ,",
    "the global charges arise from considering the generators of gauge transformations @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a boundary term . because of the presence of the boundary , the functional derivative of @xmath42 is well - defined",
    "only if the boundary term @xmath43 has the variation @xmath44 the poisson bracket of two generators of the form ( [ a4 ] ) then becomes , @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "one expects the boundary term in the right hand side of ( [ a6 ] ) to be equal to the charge @xmath47 , plus a possible central term @xcite .",
    "but to check this we first need to give boundary conditions in order to integrate ( [ a5 ] ) and extract the value of @xmath41 .",
    "we shall consider two different classes of boundary conditions .",
    "assuming that @xmath48 is fixed at the boundary the charge is @xmath49 one can then check that , indeed , the boundary term in ( [ a6 ] ) contains the charge associated to the commutator @xmath50 $ ] plus a central term . imposing the constraints",

    "it is convenient to use the gauge chosen in @xcite , and in @xcite in a parallel treatment using the wzw formulation , @xmath52 where the boundary is taken to be at fixed @xmath27 .",
    "this gauge choice together with the constraint @xmath53 imply @xmath54 the gauge choice ( [ a8a ] ) is preserved only by gauge transformations whose parameters are of the form @xmath55 since @xmath56 still contains an arbitrary function of time @xmath57 , it seems that the gauge freedom has not been fixed completely yet . the extra requirement that fixes the time dependence of the gauge parameters comes from the boundary condition on @xmath58 .",
    "we have chosen our action in order to impose one or other of the conditions @xmath59 these conditions remove the gauge invariance since the group of transformations leaving ( [ aa8 ] ) invariant does not contain any arbitrary function of time .",
    "@xmath60 is constrained to depend only on @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "setting , @xmath63 equation ( [ a8 ] ) leads to the classical kac - moody algebra @xmath64 note that the central term has the usual sign for @xmath21 .",
    "we could have obtained the same algebra by inserting ( [ a8a ] ) into the action ( [ a1 ] ) and computing the resulting poisson brackets ( see the next section for a detailed discussion of this reduction ) .",
    "we have seen above that global charges associated to gauge transformations that do not vanish at the boundary give rise to an infinite number of conserved charges satisfying the kac - moody algebra .",
    "we shall now investigate those charges associated to the group of diffeomorphisms at the boundary .",
    "since the boundary is a circle , one expects to find the virasoro algebra .",
    "furthermore , since in chern - simons theory diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations are related , one expects the virasoro and kac - moody generators to be related by the sugawara construction .",
    "actually , for those diffeomorphisms with a non - zero component normal to the boundary , one finds a twisted sugawara construction which induces a classical central charge in the virasoro algebra @xcite .",
    "this central charge was first found in @xcite in the adm formulation of 2 + 1 dimensional gravity and has recently been shown to play an important role in understanding the statistical mechanical origin of the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "recall that in chern - simons theories , diffeomorphisms with parameter @xmath65 are related to gauge transformations with parameter @xmath66 by the equations of motion . in a canonical realisation of gauge symmetries , @xmath67 is a lagrange multiplier , and so we must instead consider gauge transformations @xmath68 as we did in the last section , we fix the gauge by fixing @xmath69 . we also choose coordinates for",
    "the on - shell solution for which @xmath70 which implies @xmath71 this will be a good choice of the radial coordinate at infinity for the black hole .",
    "as a consequence of this choice , diffeomorphisms @xmath72 that preserve the gauge choice ( [ a8a ] ) and ( [ a8aa ] ) must be independent of @xmath27 . since the gauge choice only fixes the gauge freedom in the interior of the manifold ,",
    "we are able to derive the algebra of global boundary diffeomorphisms in complete generality by looking only at @xmath73 , subject to the constraints imposed by the boundary condition on the gauge field .",
    "since from ( [ mm1b ] ) the gauge parameter is field - dependent , we replace ( [ a7 ] ) by @xmath74 this is a good choice of @xmath75 since @xmath76 is left unchanged by the action of the global charges . in other words @xmath77",

    "perhaps the most important point about the analysis of global charges is that it goes through for a boundary located on any surface of constant @xmath27 .",
    "thus the set of diffeomorphisms defined by ( [ dif ] ) and ( [ condition ] ) leads to a virasoro algebra of global charges with @xmath171 on any such boundary .",
    "however , the connection between the virasoro algebra and isometries of the three metric appears to be valid only at infinity . at finite @xmath27 ,",
    "the virasoro algebra is a subset of all deformations of that surface , but without any obvious property to distinguish it . in particular , if we take the boundary to be at the horizon , we find that the global charges that generate the virasoro algebra generate a particular subset of deformations of the horizon with components both tangential and normal to the horizon , described by ( [ mm25ad ] ) and ( [ mm25ae ] ) .",

    "if at finite @xmath27 , the subset of global charges which give rise to the virasoro algebra are not special in any way , perhaps one should consider all generators @xmath172 on an equal footing , and regard the condition ( [ mm25cc ] ) as a technical step that leads to the virasoro algebra .",
    "the fact that the virasoro algebra is a subalgebra of the algebra of deformations then suggests that the number of states generated by the larger algebra should be greater than or equal to the bekenstein value .",
    "we shall discuss this issue briefly in the conclusions .",
    "we have so far in this section derived the algebra of global charges on any boundary of fixed @xmath27 , and shown that a subset of them leads to the virasoro algebra with a classical central term .",
    "we have also made explicit the relation between the asymptotic isometries of ref .",
    "@xcite and this subset of global charges when defined at infinity .",
    "we may now count states in the conformal field theory , by looking at representations of the virasoro algebra , as done in @xcite .",
    "we must look for representations with a specific value of @xmath4 and @xmath173 , since according to ( [ a19b ] ) , these two quantities are related to the mass and spin of the black hole as @xmath174 or , neglecting the @xmath175 terms , @xmath176 note that fixing ( [ nn1 ] ) is equivalent to fixing @xmath8 and @xmath9 , justifying our choice of action ( [ a1 ] ) for the micro - canonical ensemble .    as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "since @xmath3 is large , one can use the degeneracy formula for @xmath3 free bosons to deduce a density of states equal to @xmath177 which agrees with the bekenstein  hawking entropy of the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole .",
    "it is interesting that now this analysis is not necessarily related to diffeomorphisms at infinity .",
    "we can think of these states as living on any surface of constant @xmath27 , and in particular they could be defined at the horizon .",
    "as far as we are aware , this system then provides the first explicit realisation of a set of deformations of a black hole horizon that can be quantised to yield the correct bekenstein  hawking entropy .",
    "we end this section with a brief remark about the relation between the virasoro algebra ( [ a19c ] ) and the reduction of wzw theory to liouville theory as discussed in @xcite in the context of 2 + 1 dimensional gravity , and by a number of other authors in a more general context ( see @xcite for an extensive list of references ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the first step is to join the two chiral wzw theories into a single non - chiral wzw theory .",
    "then the reduction takes place by imposing certain constraints on the currents of the wzw theory and interpreting a second set of constraints as gauge fixing conditions .    referring back to the conditions ( [ mm25cc ] ) and ( [ m223 ] )",
    ", we see that ( [ m223 ] ) are just the chirality conditions for each @xmath89 sector .",

    "3 , we have worked in the grand - canonical ensemble , which we have defined by adding an appropriate boundary term at infinity .",
    "we have found that in order to obtain the correct partition function we must also add a source term at the horizon .",
    "this source term gives the correct value of the partition function both semi - classically and in an exact quantum mechanical calculation .",

    "we saw that we obtain the correct density of states at a given value of mass and spin after we make a reduction from the wzw theory to a theory of boundary deformations that satisfies the virasoro algebra , or equivalently to a liouville theory .",
    "since this reduction involves additional constraints on the allowed global charges , it one expects that the density of states should be greater in the wzw theory ( although possibly equal to leading order ) .",
    "why , then , can one not calculate the density of states directly in terms of representations of the kac - moody algebra ? in the wzw theory , it seems clear that there are an insufficient number of states ( and for this reason , in the grand - canonical ensemble the correct partition function required the addition of a source term to give a larger apparent degeneracy ) .",
    "the answer presumably lies in the use of a twisted sugawara construction to connect the kac - moody and virasoro algebras .",
    "although the states we eventually count are unitary states with respect to the standard quantisation of the virasoro algebra , they most probably correspond to a non - unitary , twisted representation of the kac - moody algebra only if the vacuum has @xmath327 , which translates to a negative eigenvalue for @xmath328 defined in an untwisted sugawara construction from the underlying wzw theory .",
    "however , it is interesting to note from ( [ m224 ] ) that the condition @xmath327 corresponds to @xmath329 , @xmath330 ( anti - de sitter space ) and @xmath331 , while the black hole vacuum @xmath332 has @xmath333 but @xmath334 .",
    "this strongly suggests that our ensemble includes anti - de sitter space as its true vacuum . ] .",
    "thus in order to find the correct density of states , we should look at a different set of states to those usually constructed in representations of the kac - moody algebra .",
    "of course , this calculation is further complicated by the fact that representations of @xmath89 wzw theory are poorly understood .",
    "in contrast to the micro - canonical case , in the grand - canonical calculation we have managed to obtain the correct density of states directly in a standard ( not twisted ) wzw theory , using standard expressions for the partition function ( and an analytic continuation ) .",
    "however , this result came from a partition function with a `` spin - structure '' term , twisting the wzw theory in the time direction .",
    "it seems likely that the twists in the space and time directions that we have discussed are related by a modular transformation is the time coordinate and to verify that this can yield the same partition function . ] .    in this context , it is also interesting to speculate on the correct interpretation of the source or wilson line term that gives rise to the non - trivial `` spin - structure '' .",
    "we saw in our semiclassical and quantum mechanical calculations that this term produces the black hole entropy not as a density of states , but rather as an operator eigenvalue .",
    "we conjecture that this source term can be understood in a different context as an effective action term .",
    "if we begin with the micro - canonical picture of a twisted wzw model with trivial spin - structure , then it should be possible to get back to an untwisted wzw theory by integrating out the additional degrees of freedom arising from the spatial twisting of the wzw theory .",
    "the effect of integrating out these states would be to introduce the spin - structure term .",
    "it would be extremely nice to see this connection explicitly .",
    "finally , we comment on what these various calculations tell us about the location of the degrees of freedom giving rise to the black hole entropy .",
    "while carlip @xcite has advocated that these degrees of freedom should be located on the black hole horizon , strominger @xcite has shown that the algebra of asymptotic isometries of the metric leads to the correct density of states .",
    "our discussion of the global charges and of the reduction to liouville theory in sec .",
    "2 showed explicitly that the virasoro algebra responsible for the density of states can live at any value of the radius @xmath27 .",
    "a similar conclusion is suggested by the @xmath27 independence of the grand - canonical calculation .",
    "we were able to obtain an explicit form for a set of deformations of the horizon whose classical algebra is the virasoro algebra , with the same classical central charge as the set of asymptotic isometries , that gives the correct bekenstein  hawking entropy .",
    "the discovery of an algebra of operators at the horizon , whose representations yield the correct density of states , makes an extension of these ideas to higher dimensions look more plausible .",
    "whereas it is unlikely that the algebra of asymptotic isometries of black holes in higher dimensions could lead to the correct density of states , it seems more likely that an algebra of deformations of the horizon could have the required properties .",
    "although these two algebras are identical in our case , this is because of the trivial dynamics of 2 + 1 dimensional gravity and would certainly not be true in general . in higher dimensional applications",
    ", one would then have to relate these charges at the horizon to the mass and spin of the black hole .",

    "however , as mentioned above in the context of wzw theory , the restriction to this subset of deformations will reduce the density of states , but it may well not change it to the leading semi - classical order . in that case , the complete algebra of deformations of the horizon would lead to the correct density of states",
    ". however , checking this probably requires getting a handle on the problem of state counting in the wzw theory .",
    "we are hopeful that a generalisation to arbitrary dimensions of the calculations that have been developed for the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole may come about through the algebra of deformations of the horizon . indeed , this algebra may have a very direct application for black holes in higher dimensions whose near - horizon behaviour is similar to the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole . in this case",
    "we would be able to talk of states localised at the horizon .",

    "in the weak coupling limit the non abelian nature of the theory can be neglected .",
    "therefore it should also be possible to derive the semiclassical value of the partition function from the abelian theory , and we shall now show that this is indeed the case . if we define @xmath335 where @xmath336 are now the generators of the abelian lie algebra , the chiral wzw action ( [ cwzw ] ) reduces to @xmath337=\\frac{k}{8\\pi } \\int \\left ( -\\partial_0 x^a    \\partial_\\varphi x_a + \\tau \\left(\\partial_\\varphi x\\right)^2 - 4\\pi    \\partial_\\varphi x^3 \\right).\\ ] ] from this action we find the field equations @xmath338 thus the general solution of these field equations contain only right moving modes which expresses the chirality of our theory .",
    "motivated by the field equation we may expand @xmath339 in normal modes as , @xmath340    note that the action ( [ c1 ] ) has a gauge symmetry , @xmath341 , which we use to set the function @xmath342 to zero . replacing the mode expansion into the chiral wzw action ,",
    "one obtains @xmath343= \\int dx^0 \\left ( - \\sum_{n\\neq 0 }    \\frac { \\dot{\\alpha}_0^a \\alpha_{a\\:n}}{ikn } + \\sum_{n\\ge 1 } \\frac{2      \\dot{\\alpha}_{-n}^a \\alpha_{a\\:n}}{ikn}+ \\tau l_0 - 2\\pi    \\alpha_0 ^ 3 \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a virasoro generator , @xmath344 and where we have eliminated total derivative terms .",
    "the action ( [ c13 ] ) gives rise to the abelian kac - moody algebra @xmath345 = n \\hbar \\frac{k}{2 } \\delta^{ab } \\delta_{n+m,0 } , \\ ] ] from which we can define a fock space in the standard manner .",
    "the partition function can be calculated as , @xmath346 \\exp \\left ( \\frac{i}{\\hbar } i_{cwzw}[\\alpha,\\tau ] \\right )    = \\int d\\alpha_0 \\tr \\exp\\left ( \\frac{i\\tau}{\\hbar } l_0   -\\frac{i}{\\hbar } 2\\pi \\alpha_0 ^ 3 \\right).\\ ] ] from the field equation ( [ c2 ] ) we deduce again that semi - classically only the zero modes contribute to the partition function .",
    "hence we may split the partition function ( [ cz ] ) into a leading and a sub - leading part @xmath347 where we have introduced the number operator @xmath348 in the saddle point approximation the integral over @xmath349 ( @xmath350 and @xmath351 ) is easily evaluated @xmath352 note that the integral over @xmath349 is only well defined , if we assume @xmath353 . for the calculation of the prefactor",

    "this calculation is well known and can be found in @xcite . in the limit @xmath355 ( large black holes )",
    "one finds @xmath356 the total partition function is thus given by @xmath357 thus the abelian calculation not only produces the bekenstein- hawking part of the partition function but also leads to the @xmath296 correction discussed above .",
