    "spectral properties , such as the one - electron spectral function , provide valuable insight into the usually complex physics of strongly correlated systems . however , reliable results for such quantities are difficult to obtain .",
    "analytical methods are often restricted to very simple limiting cases , and results can usually not be extended to more general situations .",
    "two remarkable exceptions are the holstein model with linear electron dispersion@xcite and the hubbard model,@xcite both in one dimension , which have been solved exactly . to study",
    "more general models , numerical methods such as exact diagonalization ( ed ) and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) have received much attention over the last decades .",
    "ed methods allow very accurate calculations of ground - state as well as finite - temperature spectral properties , but are restricted to rather small clusters due to the large dimension of the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "qmc can be used to obtain results on large clusters even in higher dimensions , but here the sign - problem and the ill - posed analytic continuation required to obtain dynamic correlation functions for real frequencies are detrimental for many interesting applications .",
    "the recently developed cluster perturbation theory@xcite ( cpt ) marks an important improvement of the situation .",
    "it is based on a break - up of the infinite system into identical , finite clusters , on which the one - electron green function is calculated exactly . then , the hopping between clusters is treated within strong - coupling perturbation theory@xcite ( scpt ) .",
    "the method has been successfully used for various hubbard models , to calculate spectral functions , as well as other quantities of interest , both for zero@xcite and finite temperature.@xcite although the concept of cpt relies on a model with local interactions only , it has also been applied with some success to the @xmath0 model.@xcite for the calculation of the cluster green function , the ed lanczos method ( for a review see ref .  ) can be used .",
    "for the case of coupled electron - phonon systems , such as the holstein model and its various extensionse.g.the holstein - hubbard or the holstein double - exchange model the application of ed methods is hampered by the infinite number of possible phonon configurations , which gives rise to a rapidly growing requirement of computer memory and/or cpu time as the number of lattice sites or phonon states increases .",
    "consequently , standard ed methods  employing some kind of hilbert space truncation  are restricted to very small clusters , especially for low phonon frequency and/or strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "again improved methods such as dmrg , or the use of variational phonon bases allow to extend the accessible parameter range .",
    "nevertheless , as electron - phonon interaction has been identified as an important ingredient in , e.g. , high - temperature superconductors@xcite and manganites@xcite , further progress along these lines is highly desirable .    in this paper , we show that cpt can be successfully applied to electron - phonon models with a ( local ) coupling of the holstein type.@xcite we present results for the one - electron spectral function of the holstein polaron , i.e.the holstein model with one electron , in one and two dimensions . the holstein polaron problem has been investigated intensively in the past , and a wealth of information about its spectral properties is available .",
    "we find that the use of cpt strongly reduces finite - size effects , giving results which are much closer to the thermodynamic limit than the corresponding ed data .",
    "additionally , we consider the special case of a completely saturated ferromagnetic state at zero temperature in the holstein double - exchange model@xcite for colossal magnetoresistive manganites .",
    "the latter is then equivalent to the holstein model of spinless fermions , and we combine the exact atomic - limit one - particle green function with cpt for a single - site cluster to calculate the spectral function at quarter - filling .",
    "the results of this simple approach agree well with the previously developed many - body coherent potential approximation.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : cpt ] we give a review of cpt .",
    "[ sec : holsteinpolaron ] discusses the application to the holstein polaron , while the scpt for the many - electron case is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : holsteinde ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the basic idea of cpt@xcite is to divide the infinite lattice into identical clusters , each containing @xmath1 lattice sites . adopting the notation of ref .",
    ", the hamiltonian of the system is written in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 in the most general formulation of cpt,@xcite the subscripts @xmath4 , @xmath5 denote different orbitals within a cluster , but here we restrict ourselves to the case of one orbital per site so that @xmath4 , @xmath6 . the vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 correspond to sites in the superlattice of clusters ( see ref .  ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0pv ] ) , @xmath9 represents a hamiltonian of a single cluster  containing local interactions only  and @xmath10 describes the hopping between clusters , i.e.the hopping amplitude between site @xmath4 of cluster @xmath7 and site @xmath5 of cluster @xmath8 is given by the matrix element @xmath11 .",
    "although long - range hopping can also be included,@xcite we shall only consider models with nearest - neighbor hopping so that @xmath12 for neighboring sites @xmath4 , @xmath5 in adjacent clusters @xmath7 , @xmath8 . within cpt , an approximation for the green function of the original system , @xmath13 , is obtained using an analytical strong - coupling perturbation expansion up to first order of the inter - cluster hopping @xmath10 ( for details of the derivation see ref .  ) .",
    "the resulting equation relating the green function of the original lattice to the energy - dependent cluster green function @xmath14 reads@xcite @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath14 and @xmath17 stand for @xmath18 matrices , and the inter - cluster hopping @xmath10 has been partially fourier - transformed exploiting the translational symmetry of the cluster superlattice , with @xmath19 being a wave vector of the reduced brillouin zone.@xcite finally , the green function @xmath20 can be transformed from the mixed representation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpt1 ] ) , real space within a cluster and reciprocal space between clusters , using@xcite @xmath21 to obtain the familiar representation of the one - electron green function . @xmath22 as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cpt1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : cpt2 ] ) becomes exact in the atomic limit @xmath23 ( refs .  ) .",
    "moreover , it also reduces to the exact result for the case of non - interacting electrons@xcite since , in this case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpt1 ] ) corresponds to the exact resummation of the perturbation series .",
    "finally , cpt also becomes exact in the limit @xmath24 ( refs .  ) .",
    "the one - electron cluster green function at zero temperature @xmath25 can be calculated exactly for any pair of site indices @xmath4 , @xmath5 in the cluster using , e.g. , the lanczos method . here",
    "@xmath26 is the energy of the ground state @xmath27 of the cluster , and a spin index has been suppressed in the notation .",
    "the two parts of the green function matrix @xmath28 correspond to adding or removing an electron to / from @xmath27 .",
    "finally , the one - electron spectral function is defined as @xmath29    since cpt is based on a perturbation expansion in the inter - cluster hopping , the method can be expected to work especially well in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "this is also illustrated by the fact that it becomes exact in the atomic limit , as mentioned above .",
    "on the other hand , for weak or intermediate coupling , the electronic kinetic energy is not small compared to the local interactions .",
    "consequently , the size of the cluster has to be large enough in order to obtain accurate results .",
    "in fact , from previous applications of cpt , e.g. , to the one- and two - dimensional hubbard model,@xcite the cluster size @xmath1 emerged as the main control parameter of the method . in the case of the one - dimensional hubbard model , for example",
    ", @xmath30 is identical to the hubbard i approximation,@xcite while @xmath31 already gives a spectral function that contains most of the relevant features such as short - range antiferromagnetic ordering.@xcite with increasing @xmath1 , the cpt green function approaches systematically the exact result for the infinite system . for identical cluster size",
    ", the cpt spectrum contains many more poles with significant residues than the corresponding results of ed .",
    "in fact , also in the 1d hubbard model , the spectrum obtained with cpt on a four - site cluster is already comparable in quality to the ed spectrum for @xmath32 ( refs .  ) .",
    "an additional advantage of cpt is the possibility to evaluate @xmath33 at continuous wavevectors @xmath34 , in contrast to ed which restricts @xmath34 to the @xmath1 vectors of the first brillouin zone of the cluster , of which only @xmath35 are physically distinct .",
    "finally , finite temperature lanczos methods can also be combined with cpt to calculate thermodynamic properties.@xcite    concerning the application of the lanczos method to calculate the cluster green function @xmath28 , it is important to stress the need for open boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "attempts have been made to use periodic bcs and subtract the corresponding terms afterward in the perturbative treatment of the inter - cluster hopping , but it has been found that the accuracy of the results is much better for the case of open bcs . although the latter are physically more intuitive in connection with cpt , the calculation of the cluster green function with the lanczos method becomes more difficult as one can not exploit translational symmetry .",
    "other symmetries such as the inversion group can be used in principle , but are usually not as effective in saving computer memory by reducing the size of the corresponding hamiltonian matrix and lanczos vectors .",
    "we want to point out that cpt does not in principle rely on the ed method .",
    "in fact , the cluster green function may be calculated using any method available.@xcite indeed we will see in sec .  [",
    "sec : holsteinde ] that it is possible to combine the exact analytic solution for the atomic - limit green function with cpt , to obtain results which agree surprisingly well with the many - body coherent potential approximation.@xcite    in addition to the spectral function considered here , other physical properties of the system can also be calculated with cpt .",
    "this includes , e.g. , the ground state energy of the infinite system , the electronic kinetic energy or the fermi surface.@xcite the strength of cpt lies in the calculation of the one - particle green function and related quantities such as the density of states .",
    "the numerical effort is relatively small compared to more sophisticated methods like dmrg or qmc .",
    "an additional advantage of cpt is the fact that it can easily be applied also to two - dimensional systems , in contrast to , e.g. , dmrg .",
    "finally , an important disadvantage of cpt should be mentioned : within the current formulation , two - particle green functions can not be calculated .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to compute , e.g. , the dc conductivity or other interesting two - particle correlation functions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the holstein model@xcite reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators for an electron with spin @xmath41 and a phonon of frequency @xmath42 at lattice site @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the electron occupation number is defined as @xmath44 with @xmath45 , and the parameters of the model are the hopping integral for nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath46 , and the electron - phonon coupling strength , denoted as @xmath47 .",
    "it is common to define a dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the bandwidth of the bare electron band , and a dimensionless phonon frequency @xmath50 .",
    "the holstein model can then be described using only these two parameters .",
    "moreover , we shall express all energies in units of @xmath46 . as mentioned above ,",
    "here we only consider the one - electron limit of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) which is also called the holstein polaron problem .",
    "although there is only a single electron in the system , the coupling to the phonons makes it a complex many - body problem , which has been the focus of much theoretical work .",
    "the restriction to one electron greatly simplifies calculations with the lanczos method since both , the number of required phonon states@xcite and the number of electron configurations grow noticeably with the number of particles .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : holsteinde ] , we will use the exact result for the atomic - limit green function and cpt for a single - site cluster to calculate the spectral function of the holstein model of spinless fermions at quarter - filling .",
    "following other authors,@xcite we calculate the green function @xmath51 where @xmath52 represents the ground state of the phonons and the vacuum state for the electrons .",
    "the spin index can be suppressed due to the symmetry of the problem .",
    "the corresponding one - electron spectral function is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : akw ] ) .    compared to the class of hubbard models for which cpt has been originally developed",
    ", we are facing an additional difficulty arising from the  priori infinite number of allowed phonon states .",
    "we employ a widely used truncation scheme@xcite of the phonon hilbert space which is spanned by the basis states @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the number of phonons at lattice site @xmath43 .",
    "now the truncation consists in restricting the basis states to the subset with @xmath55 leading to @xmath56 allowed phonon configurations .",
    "the convergence of the results with @xmath57 can be monitored using the ground - state energy @xmath58 of the cluster with open bcs . in all results of this paper , @xmath57 was chosen such that the relative error for the ground state with one electron , @xmath59 , was smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "we find that convergence of @xmath58 also ensures a well - converged spectral function .",
    "moreover , the influence of the number of phonons kept in the calculation is much larger for the incoherent part of the spectrum than for the coherent , low - energy quasi - particle peak which determines @xmath58 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : comp - with - exact ] ) .",
    "finally , a refined truncation scheme which allows for extremely accurate results ( relative error @xmath61 ) has been proposed by wellein et al.@xcite .",
    "before we come to a discussion of the results obtained with cpt , we want to comment on some of the existing work on spectral properties of the holstein polaron .",
    "as indicated before , the most reliable method to calculate dynamic quantities , such as @xmath33 , is ed which has been used extensively in the past .",
    "@xcite most of this work has focused on the polaron band structure @xmath62 instead of the spectral function , since it is often easier to interpret , especially in the strong - coupling regime where the structure of @xmath33 is rather complicated . however , as pointed out by wellein et al.,@xcite the two quantities are closely related .",
    "in fact the position of the lowest - energy peak in @xmath33 , obtained from the green function  ( [ eq : g_lanczos ] ) , follows exactly the polaron band structure as we vary @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , as discussed by wellein and fehske,@xcite the integral over this first peak is equivalent to the quasi - particle ( qp ) weight @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the lowest - energy single - polaron state in the sector with total momentum @xmath34 .",
    "other numerical methods which have been used to calculate the spectrum of the holstein polaron include dmrg@xcite ( in one dimension ) , finite - cluster strong coupling perturbation theory@xcite",
    "( 1d , 2d ) , qmc@xcite ( 1d3d ) , and variational methods@xcite ( 1d4d ) .      as mentioned above",
    ", the critical parameter of cpt is the number of sites in the cluster . to demonstrate the advantage of cpt over the standard ed method ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : lan_cpt_weak ] the spectral function @xmath65 in one dimension for different cluster sizes @xmath1 .",
    "we chose @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which is the regime where an extended polaron exists ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . consequently",
    ", significant finite - size effects can be expected for small clusters , which is exactly what we see in the ed results . for the latter periodic bcs",
    "have been used .",
    "[ fig : lan_cpt_weak ] clearly shows that the shape of the large qp peak at @xmath68 changes very little with increasing @xmath1 for both , ed and cpt , but a noticeable shift can be observed in the case of the ed spectra as we go from @xmath31 to @xmath69 .",
    "the influence of @xmath1 is much larger for the incoherent part of the spectrum , which lies about a distance @xmath70 above the qp peak .",
    "the ed spectra display sharp , well - separated peaks , whereas the corresponding cpt data  containing many more poles  resembles much closer the expected results for an infinite system .",
    "the latter has been investigated by marsiglio@xcite using migdal - eliashberg theory .",
    "for the same parameters , he found that the qp peak remains almost unchanged as @xmath24 , while the incoherent part evolves into a continuous band that fits well to the cpt results even for rather small clusters @xmath71 .",
    "we have also compared @xmath72 for @xmath73 , and the observed influence of finite - size effects agrees perfectly with previous work of wellein and fehske:@xcite as @xmath74 increases from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , the size of the polaron increases , and the deviations of the ed data from the cpt results become larger . in the strong - coupling or small - polaron regime , not shown here",
    ", finite - size effects are known to be small .",
    "consequently , even for very small clusters , ed and cpt both give well - converged results for the qp peak which determines , e.g. , the ground - state energy .",
    "however , in the case of ed , the incoherent part of the spectrum for wavevector @xmath74 , corresponding to excitations of an electron with momentum @xmath77 and a phonon with momentum @xmath78 , still exhibits the typical multi - peak structure of a finite system , whereas the cpt results again reproduce much better the incoherent band found in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "[ fig : lan_cpt_weak ] reveals small additional peaks  not present in the ed spectra  which move from the incoherent part of @xmath72 towards the qp peak with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "additional calculations for larger clusters have shown that these peaks vanish systematically with increasing @xmath1 , so that the cpt spectrum approaches the exact result in the thermodynamic limit @xmath82 , as expected .",
    "consequently , these peaks are not a defect of cpt , but represent finite - size effects which arise from the approximate treatment of inter - cluster hopping .",
    "the latter , in combination with the open bcs used to calculate the cluster green function , leads to a system which does not have perfect translational symmetry .",
    "the situation is equivalent to ed with open bcs : for @xmath24 the spectrum approaches the results of an infinite cluster .",
    "however , in contrast to cpt , the effects for finite @xmath1 are much more significant . moreover , these finite - size effects manifest themselves in a slightly different way than in the case of periodic bcs , where no additional peaks  showing the afore mentioned behavior  are found . in the case of cpt , already for the small cluster sizes shown in fig .

    "in the last section , we have restricted ourselves to the holstein model with one electron .",
    "although cpt has been successfully applied , e.g. , to the many - electron hubbard model,@xcite the electron - phonon coupling in the holstein model greatly complicates calculations using lanczos ed . for finite electron density , we combine cpt with the exact analytic result for the green function in the atomic limit . for the atomic limit , the green function has been obtained for many models using the equation - of - motion method,@xcite and here it will allow us to obtain results for the many - electron case which will be compared with the many - body coherent potential approximation discussed below .      extending previous work of edwards et al.@xcite for the pure double - exchange ( de ) model ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , green@xcite studied the holstein - de model using a many - body coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) which , owing to the more complicated form of the holstein - de hamiltonian , constitutes a considerable extension of the hubbard iii approximation.@xcite the many - body cpa successfully describes many aspects of the manganites , and we refer the reader to a recent review of this work by edwards.@xcite here we only consider the special case of a completely saturated ferromagnetic state at temperature @xmath109 , with all itinerant spins having @xmath110 spin , say .",

    "the results@xcite for @xmath33 , shown in fig .

    "had also been given by dessau et al.@xcite well away from the fermi surface , a well - defined peak exists which broadens as @xmath34 approaches the fermi level @xmath130 at @xmath131 . if @xmath132 is increased further , most of the spectral weight is transfered above @xmath130 . moreover",

    "( [ eq : g_al ] ) . in the sequel",
    ", we shall refer to this approximation as scpt .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the approach becomes exact for @xmath23 . historically , a similar strong - coupling expansion for the hubbard model@xcite  including higher order corrections  has been the starting point for the development of cpt .",
    "before we discuss the results , we would like to comment on the quality of the scpt used here : while the many - body cpa requires a self - consistent , iterative solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpa ] ) , the scpt green function is obtained from the lehmann representation of the atomic - limit green function  ( [ eq : g_al ] ) , and the subsequent use of the resulting self - energy @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf_k ] ) .",
    "similar to the original hubbard i approximation,@xcite the resulting green function consists of delta peaks corresponding to states with infinite lifetime .",
    "however , due to the poles in the self - energy , there are no states at the fermi level and the system is not a fermi liquid .",
    "as in the many - body cpa , @xmath140 depends on @xmath34 only through the band energy @xmath138 , whereas the self - energy is local .",
    "this reliance on the atomic limit is reasonable in the strong - coupling regime considered here , where small polarons move in an extremely narrow band .",
    "consequently , the simple perturbative treatment of the hopping term can be expected to give sensible results .",
    "nevertheless , in scpt , we have to use an artificial imaginary part @xmath141which does not depend on energy  to obtain peaks of finite width .",
    "although for large enough @xmath141 there will be states at the fermi level , the latter have only finite lifetime even for @xmath109 .",
    "hence , both scpt and the many - body cpa never give a fermi liquid , but the self - consistent cpa green function yields an imaginary part of the self - energy that shows the correct , strong energy - dependence except for the region inside the very small , incoherent polaron band around @xmath130 , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : many - body - cpa ] .",
    "thus , as could be expected from the hubbard i - like approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf_k ] ) , the many - body cpa is superior to scpt , although both approaches become exact in the atomic limit .    the spectral function obtained with scpt using eq .",
    "( [ eq : akw ] ) , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpa - cpt ] , resembles quite closely the results of hohenadler and edwards.@xcite although there are some differences concerning the width and the position of the peaks , the overall behavior is very similar . in particular , the broadening of the qp peak near the fermi surface at @xmath131 is well reproduced .",
    "clearly , the success of scpt consists in a surprisingly good agreement with the cpa data for all @xmath34 . despite this agreement",
    ", cpt fails to reproduce the polaron sub - bands , and the sharp edge to the pseudogap for large values of @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , the gap is larger than in the cpa data .",
    "these shortcomings are a consequence of the rather crude approximation . nevertheless , keeping in mind the simplicity of the ansatz ,",
    "the agreement with the many - body cpa is satisfactory .",
    "we would like to point out that the scpt presented here can also be generalized to the holstein - de model with quantum spins ( e.g.@xmath142 appropriate for the manganites@xcite ) and at finite temperature , using the atomic - limit green function given by edwards.@xcite finally , the approximation could be systematically improved by increasing the number of sites in the cluster , which is exactly the idea behind cpt .",
    "however , for @xmath143 the cluster green function can no longer be calculated analytically and one has to resort to numerical methods such as ed as in sec .",
    "[ sec : holsteinpolaron ] .",
    "such calculations are extremely difficult for the case of quarter - filled two- or three dimensional clusters , small phonon frequency and strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "future work along these lines  employing optimized phonon approaches@xcite ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : summary])is highly desirable in order to assess the quality of the many - body cpa results .",
    "we have applied cluster perturbation theory to the holstein polaron problem in one and two dimensions , and comparison with existing work has revealed very good agreement . in combination with the lanczos method to calculate the cluster green function ,",
    "the method gives reliable results for the one - electron spectral function @xmath33 , which become exact in the weak- and strong - coupling limit , @xmath144 and @xmath23 , respectively , and for the case of an infinite cluster .",
    "calculations for continuous values of the wavevector @xmath34 are possible and , more importantly , finite - size effects are significantly reduced compared to standard ed .",
    "our results extend previous applications of cpt to hubbard and @xmath0 models , showing that the method is also well - suited for electron - phonon models with local interactions .",
    "as pointed out before , for more than one electron in the system , it becomes increasingly difficult to include enough phonon states so as to obtain converged results .",
    "future work may therefore combine optimized phonon approaches@xcite and cpt to investigate more complicated problems such as the many - electron case , or extended models including , e.g. , a hubbard term .",
