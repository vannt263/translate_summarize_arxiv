    "the lmc contains a rich system of stellar clusters , with more than three thousand cataloged objects ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bica  2008 ) ) and covering ages from few myr to about 13 gyr .",
    "there are about one hundred that can be considered as populous ones ( @xmath1 stars ) , which offer the opportunity to recover the age - metallicity relation for the lmc by means of accurate age ( from cmd analysis ) and metallicity ( from spectroscopy analysis ) determinations .",
    "furthermore , the objects with ages between @xmath0 0.3 and 4 gyr  the intermediate - age lmc clusters ( iacs )  are more metal poor than the open clusters in the milky way , being therefore fundamental pieces in the local universe to calibrate integrated light models as well as to test the evolutionary models in the sub - solar metallicity regime .    taking the advantage of the superior photometric quality of the hst and the intrinsic large stellar statistics for the populous iacs we have applied a statistical method to recover accurate physical parameters",
    " not only age , but also metallicity , distance and reddening  for these objects in a self - consistent way . by self - consistency",
    "we mean the ability to simultaneously infer these parameters from the same data - set without any prior assumptions about any of them .",
    "the method , presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kerber , santiago & brocato  ( 2007 )  ( hereafter ksb07 ) ) using the padova isochrones ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* girardi  2002 ) ) , joins cmd modelling and statistical analysis to objectively determine which are the synthetic cmds that best reproduce the observed ones . in the present work we expanded this analysis to two other stellar evolutionary libraries : pel ( or pisa , ( *",
    "* castellani  2003 ) ) and basti ( or teramo , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pietrinferni  2004 ) ) .",
    "this allowed us to quantify how the recovered physical parameters depend on the adoption of different stellar evolutionary libraries , including the treatment for the convective core overshooting .",
    "furthermore , since we are determining the individual distance to each cluster , we could also probe the three dimensional distribution of these clusters , which seems to be roughly aligned with lmc disk ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ksb07 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* grocholski  2007 ) ) , and to obtain new determinations of distance modulus to the lmc centre .",

    "we analysed hst / wfpc2 ( v , b ",
    "v ) cmds for a sample of 15 iacs in the lmc covering ages from @xmath00.3 to @xmath04 gyr .",
    "these data come from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brocato  ( 2001 ) ) and are photometrically quite homogeneous , reaching typically v@xmath3 . as can be seen in fig.[fig1 ] , these cmds cover at least 2 magnitudes along the main sequence ( ms ) and clearly display the core helium burning stars in the red clump ( rc ) .    .",
    "we are modelling these cmds as ssps , where the basic steps to generate a synthetic cmd are the following : 1 ) we choose the stellar evolutionary model ; 2 ) we choose an age and metallicity .",
    "these two steps are equivalent to picking up an isochrone from the adopted stellar evolutionary library ; 3 ) we apply our choice of distance modulus and reddening to the isochrone ; 4 ) we distribute the synthetic stars following a salpeter imf and a fraction of binaries of 30% ; 5 ) as a last step we introduce the photometric errors and completeness as determined from the data .    . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we can see the basic differences in the three stellar evolutionary libraries that were used . all of them offer models with treatment for convective core overshooting with similar values for @xmath4 .",
    "however , only pel and basti also offer models without overshooting  the classical or canonical models . another important difference between the libraries is their discreteness or the number of steps in age or metallicity . in this aspect",
    "padova offers a significant larger number of possibilities than the other libraries , specially pel , where there are only three values of metallicity available .",
    ".the adopted stellar evolutionary libraries [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the clusters are ordered according to age , with the youngest on the left .",
    "the symbols code the different choices of stellar evolutionary models : padova ( stars ) , pel with ( solid triangles ) and without ( open triangles ) overshooting , basti with ( solid circles ) and without ( open circles ) overshooting .",
    "the median values for all clusters are also shown in the figure .",
    ", width=321 ]    to determine the quality of the fit we took simultaneously the ms and rc fit into account .",
    "we define a parameter called _",
    "n _ for each model as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 means the standard deviation in each statistics as determined by control experiments .",
    "so , the best model is the one that minimizes this parameter ( @xmath7 ) .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , there is no clear age dependence in the quality of the fit . on the other hand , on average , models with overshooting fit better the data than the classical ones .",
    "furthermore , the quality of the fit is similar for the pel and basti libraries , but significant higher for the padova models .",
    "since we determined the individual distances to each cluster we were able to probe the 3d distribution of these objects and also to provide new determinations of the distance to the lmc centre .",
    "these results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which reveals that : 1 ) independent of the adopted stellar evolutionary library , the iacs have a spatial distribution roughly aligned ( disk inclination @xmath8 deg ) with the lmc disk as defined by field stars ( in this case cepheid stars , ( * ? ? ? * nikolaev  2004 ) ) ; 2 ) the iacs seem to belong to a thick disk , and the spatial scatter around the best - fit geometry is slightly smaller for models with overshooting ; 3 ) the determined distance modulli to the lmc center are marginally consistent with the canonical value of 18.50 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* clementini  2003 ) ) ; the pel models recovered systematically larger values than the ones obtained using the other libraries ."
