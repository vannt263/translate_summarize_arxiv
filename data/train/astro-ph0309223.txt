    "the extremely red objects ( eros ) , originally discovered in the k - band survey of elston , rieke & rieke ( 1988 ) , have become more and more present in deep near - ir and optical surveys ( see yan & thompson 2003 for a review ) . operationally defined in terms of the observed optical / near - ir colours ( e.g. @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) , significantly different from those of typical field objects , eros may nevertheless comprise an assorted mix of galactic and extragalactic objects .",
    "we focus on the extremely red galaxies ( ergs ) , which account for the bulk of the observed eros . for the optically selected ergs ,",
    "the contamination from agns is less than 15 per cent ( alexander et al . 2002 ; brusa et al .",
    "2002 ; smail et al .",
    "2002 ) , even though obscured , compton - thin agns , partly associated with dusty starbursts having large star formation rates ( sfrs ) , most probably dominate x - ray selected erg samples ( stevens et al . 2003 ) .",
    "ergs still lack an uncontroversial classification because their very red colours can be reproduced by at least two very different sets of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) not associated with an agn : those expected for passively evolving , old ( @xmath3 ) stellar populations in a dust - free environment , associated with ellipticals , and those expected for dusty starburst galaxies ( dsgs ) , both at high redshift ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "indeed it emerges that a half or more of the entire erg sample in the literature contains ellipticals ( moriondo , cimatti & daddi 2000 ; stiavelli & treu 2001 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2002 ; cimatti et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "ergs represent a key - case in the knowledge of the cosmic history of star formation .",
    "in fact old , massive ellipticals at @xmath15 represent a problem for the standard hierarchical merging scenario of galaxy formation and evolution ( white & frenk 1991 ) , where the most massive galaxies are assembled through a merging tree of less massive systems , even though the bulk of their stars may already be very old at the time of the last major merging ( e.g. kauffmann , charlot & white 1996 ; springel & hernquist 2003 ) .",
    "conversely , the association of ergs with dsgs at intermediate redshifts does not necessarily favour the latter scenario , if galaxies are assembled within times comparable to their star formation timescales and the latter are shorter the larger the masses of the galaxies are , as independently proposed for late- ( gavazzi , pierini & boselli 1996 ) and early - type galaxies ( thomas , maraston & bender 2002 ) .",
    "interestingly `` hyper '' ergs have been interpreted as primodial ellipticals in a dusty starburst phase at @xmath16 ( totani et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "unfortunately the classification either as a passively evolving , old elliptical or as a dusty starburst galaxy at @xmath15 is uncomfortably ambiguous in absence of an extensively observed sed ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2001 ) , but the needed observations are extremely challenging at present , given the faintness of the ergs ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "hence pozzetti & mannucci ( 2000  hereafter referred to as pm00 ) have proposed a classification criterion based on the relatively easily obtainable optical / near - ir photometry , particularly suitable for large samples of eros with @xmath1721 .",
    "this classification criterion is based on the rather neat difference in the distribution of the pm00 model ellipticals and dsgs at @xmath4 in the @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) vs. @xmath2 colour  colour diagram .",
    "this separation is mainly due to the fact that passively evolving , old stellar populations at these redshifts have their strong @xmath18 break redshifted to @xmath19 ( j band ) , while coeval dusty galaxies show smoother seds and therefore redder observed @xmath2 colours , whatever the dust / stars configuration is .",
    "for the dusty ergs , there is no unanimous consensus on the typical dustiness and star formation rate .",
    "the detection of eroj164502 + 4626.4 ( @xmath20 ) at @xmath21 ( cimatti et al .",
    "1998 ) suggested that dusty ergs may host massive quantities of dust accompanied by very high sfrs , as in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( see also cimatti et al .",
    "1997 ; elbaz et al .",
    "independently , 1.4 ghz radio maps reveal that @xmath22 per cent of the ergs with @xmath9 have radio luminosities expected for ulirgs at @xmath8 ( smail et al .",
    "conversely , andreani et al . (",
    "1999 ) and mohan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) conclude that about 20 per cent of the bright ( @xmath1220 ) ergs show strong submm emission but that the dominant population of dusty , bright ergs is probably made of starburst galaxies with a total mid - ir  mm rest - frame luminosity lower than @xmath23 and @xmath24 few @xmath25 ( i.e. , non - ulirgs ) .    here",
    "we re - address the optical / near - ir photometric classification of ergs and investigate the relation between reddening , dustiness and sfr in dusty ergs .",
    "four are the main new points of this study .",
    "first , we consider the presence of _ stellar populations which are formed in a burst of short ( @xmath5 ) duration and are observed at @xmath4 in an early post - starburst phase while still embedded in a dusty medium_. second , we consider the presence of passively evolving , old , _ dusty elliptical galaxies _ at @xmath4 as additional candidate ergs .",
    "third , the treatment of dust attenuation follows the monte carlo simulations of the radiative transfer by witt & gordon ( 2000  hereafter referred to as wg00 ) for starbursts and post - starbursts , and those of witt , thronson & capuano ( 1992  hereafter referred to as wtc92 ) for ellipticals . _ for dsgs and dusty post - starburst galaxies ( dpsgs ) ,",
    "these models explore the dependence of dust attenuation from wavelength as a function of a dust / stars configuration , structure of the dusty medium and dust properties which were not considered simultaneously or at all by pm00 _ ( see sect .",
    "fourth , we calculate the total emission from dust in the mid - ir(sub)mm wavelength range for dsgs / dpsgs .",
    "for our candidate ergs ( passively evolving , old ellipticals and dsgs / dpsgs ) , we consider three representative redshifts ( @xmath27 , 1.39 and 1.85 ) , consistent with published results .",
    "we adopt the so - called `` concordance '' cosmological model ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) with hubble constant @xmath30 to link redshift and age of the models .",
    "we use two evolutionary synthesis codes ( one for ellipticals and one for dsgs / dpsgs ) and fix metallicity ( i.e. , solar  @xmath31 ) and initial mass function ( salpeter 1955 ) , since pm00 made an exhaustive investigation of the influence of these parameters on the colours of their candidate ergs .",
    "however we will discuss the impact of sub - solar metallicities on our results .",
    "our focus is on the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 colours , where cousins ( 1978 ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 filters and bessel & brett ( 1988 ) j and k filters are used .        as in pm00 , passively evolving , old ( @xmath3 ) elliptical galaxies are simulated through simple stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "hereafter they are referred to as es for simplicity .",
    "their intrinsic ( i.e. , unattenuated by dust ) seds are computed with the evolutionary synthesis code of maraston ( 1998 ) .",
    "we assume a maximal formation redshift @xmath34 , against the three values of formation redshift ( i.e. , @xmath35 , 4 and 6 ) assumed by pm00 for their model es .",
    "an elliptical galaxy formed at @xmath34 has an age of about 5 , 4 and 3 gyr at @xmath27 , 1.39 and 1.85 , respectively .",
    "one formed at @xmath35 ( pm00 ; see also totani et al .",
    "2001 ) has an age of about 3.4 , 2.4 and 1.4 gyr at @xmath27 , 1.39 and 1.85 , respectively .",
    "we note that a 1 gyr - old galaxy at @xmath27 , 1.39 or 1.85 was formed at @xmath36 , 1.85 or 2.59 , respectively .",
    "thus a 1 gyr - old elliptical at @xmath37 may have its progenitor in the redshift range that we are interested in .",
    "hence it is important to investigate the case of a post - starburst galaxy and illustrate the difference between a model dpsg and a model elliptical galaxy of similar young / intermediate age ( see sect .",
    "2.2.1 ) .    for model",
    "es we adopt a minimum stellar mass of @xmath38 , which is about the residual ( i.e. , after 25 per cent mass - loss owing to stellar evolution ) stellar mass of a 1 gyr - old ssp ( from maraston 1998 ) as well as of a 1 gyr - old model dsg / dpsg ( cf .",
    "2.2.1 ) , both originating from a @xmath39 cloud of primordial gas .",
    "we test the impact of dust attenuation on the observed seds of es at @xmath4 .",
    "the residual interstellar medium of a dusty elliptical is considered to be negligible with respect to its characteristic stellar mass .    for dusty es",
    "we adopt the dust attenuation curves obtained from the monte carlo simulations of the radiative transfer by wtc92 for the cloudy geometry ( see also wg00 ) .",
    "this geometry assumes a spherical stellar distribution that declines from the core as @xmath40 and a _ homogeneous milky way - type dust present only in the inner portions of the model _ , extending from the center to two thirds of the galaxy radius and following a distribution that declines as @xmath41 .",
    "the results of this model are robust when different radial dependences of the stellar and dust distributions are assumed ( cf .",
    "bianchi , ferrara & giovanardi 1996 ; wise & silva 1996 ; wg00 ) .",
    "the value of the radial extinction optical depth from the center to the edge of the dust environment at v - band , assuming a constant density , homogeneous distribution , ( @xmath42 ) is set to 0.5 , consistent with the mean @xmath42 estimated from the analysis of broad - band colour gradients in nearby es ( wtc92 ; wise & silva 1996 ) .",
    "these studies provide upper limits to @xmath42 , since they do not take into account intrinsic gradients in metallicity of the stellar populations of es ( e.g. saglia et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in fig .",
    "2 , we reproduce the attenuation function , normalized to its v - band value , ( @xmath43 ) of dusty es for @xmath44 , which produces a value of the stellar reddening ( @xmath45 ) equal to 0.15",
    ".        intrinsic seds of young ( @xmath46)/intermediate - age ( 0.11 gyr ) starburst and intermediate - age post - starburst galaxies are computed with the evolutionary synthesis code ( version 2.0 ) pgase ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) , because this code includes nebular emission .",
    "pgase 2.0 does not include the tp - agb phase that is dominant at intermediate ages , but this fact does not represent a major problem since we are considering observed wavelengths shorter than @xmath47 ( k band ) .",
    "gas is assumed to be transformed into @xmath31 stars at a constant rate over a period @xmath48 of @xmath5 ( _ short burst _ ) or @xmath49 ( _ long burst _ ) at @xmath4 . for a total mass of transformed gas @xmath50",
    ", a sfr equal to @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath52 ( long burst ) or @xmath53 ( short burst ) . note that sfrs @xmath54 have been inferred from observations of high-@xmath6 scuba submm sources ( e.g. , smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",

    "2000 ; lutz et al .",
    "2001 ; smail et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "these star formation histories and sfrs are complementary to those adopted by pm00 for their dsgs for the following reason . _",
    "the constant star formation rate from a formation redshift 2.5 or , especially , 6 , assumed by pm00 for their basic model of a dsg , better corresponds to a continuously star - forming galaxy with an intermediate / low sfr at @xmath4_. an object formed at @xmath55(6 ) is about 0.7(2.3 ) gyr old at @xmath56 , and 3.2(4.8 ) gyr old at @xmath57 , for the same cosmology as in sect .",
    "2 . hence it may hardly sustain a constant sfr larger than @xmath52 for such long times . for our dsgs /",
    "dpsgs observed at @xmath27 , 1.39 or 1.85 , the maximum age of 1 gyr corresponds to a maximum @xmath58 of 1.39 , 1.85 or 2.59 , respectively . hence _",
    "these systems are mostly formed at @xmath4_. we consider additional model ages of 50 , 100 , 200 , 300 and 500 myr .",
    "pm00 consider also model starbursts with a sfr having an e - folding time of 100 myr .",
    "these pm00 models are consistent with our models of starbursts with a short burst at an age of 100 myr .",
    "however , pm00 do not consider an early post - starburst phase at @xmath4 .    at this point",
    "the difference between a post - starburst galaxy and a passively evolving elliptical galaxy younger than 1 gyr may sound a matter of semantics , since a dsg at @xmath4 may evolve into an elliptical at @xmath59 and , eventually , already at these redshifts . as far as stellar properties are concerned , the seds of the post - starburst stellar population under investigation and of an ssp with the same age and metallicity , identified as a passively evolving elliptical galaxy , are different ( as expected ) even after 1 gyr from the onset of star formation , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . however , it is the presence , distribution and structure of the ( dusty ) interstellar medium which provides fundamental physical differences between these two stellar systems in our models .",
    "the mass fractions of stars and residual gas are 74 ( 77 ) per cent and 22 ( 19 ) per cent , respectively , for a 1 gyr - old stellar system formed in a short ( long ) burst .",
    "for dsgs with a short burst , these fractions are 87 per cent and 11 per cent , respectively , at the end of the burst ( i.e. , at an age of 100 myr ) .",
    "we assume that gas and dust components survive at least partly in model dsgs / dpsgs for the largest time - window ( 1 gyr ) considered for these objects ( see sect .",
    "the fate of these components afterwards may channel the evolution of these starbursts towards either a `` gas - poor '' system ( i.e. , an early - type galaxy ) or a `` gas - rich '' one ( i.e. , a late - type galaxy ) at @xmath59 , both systems having a stellar mass of @xmath60@xmath39 .",
    "thus a 1 gyr - old dpsg at @xmath61 could be the transition evolutionary phase of elliptical dusty formation occurred at intermediate redshift ( @xmath623 ) ( totani et al .",
    "2001 ; granato et al .",
    "however the dusty formation of more massive es at intermediate redshift would require initial starbursts with @xmath63 and/or @xmath64 ( cf .",
    "granato et al .",
    "2001 ) .     and age equal to 0.2 ( red line ) or 1 gyr ( magenta line ) and the intrinsic sed of a stellar population originated in a 100 myr burst with @xmath31 and age equal to 0.2 ( blue line ) , 0.3 ( cyan line ) , 0.5 ( green line ) or 1 gyr ( black line ) .",
    "each sed is in the object s rest - frame and is normalized to the luminosity at @xmath65 .",
    "it is evident that these two sets of seds are different at any intermediate age.,width=317 ]      gordon , calzetti & witt ( 1997  hereafter referred to as gcw97 ) have investigated the nature of the dust in starbursts by constructing different models of the stars and dust in dsgs , combining stellar evolutionary synthesis and radiative transfer through dust , and applying them to the observed uv / optical colours of 30 nearby starburst galaxies of the calzetti sample ( calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) .",
    "their main conclusion are as follows .    *",
    "starburst dust has an extinction curve lacking the @xmath66 bump , like the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) curve and at variance with the milky way ( mw ) curve , and a steep far - uv rise , intermediate between these two curves .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion of calzetti et al .. * the dust / stars geometry that better explains the distribution of these 30 starbursts in various uv / optical colour  colour plots has an inner dust - free sphere of stars surrounded by an outer star - free shell with a two - phase clumpy , dusty medium .",
    "a geometry where dust and stars are uniformly mixed through the entire sphere can not explain the spread in the uv / optical colours , be its local distribution of dust homogeneous or clumpy .",
    "models of dusty starbursts based on similar considerations well reproduce the optical colour  redshift distribution of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath67 ( vijh , gordon & witt 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , cimatti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that the stellar component of eroj164502 + 4626.4 should be strongly embedded in the dust in order to reproduce its observed extremely red colour .    for all these reasons ,",
    "we apply the monte carlo simulations of the radiative transfer by wg00 for the shell geometry to dsgs / dpsgs at @xmath4 .",
    "this geometry assumes _ a dust / stars distribution where the stars extend to 0.3 of the system radius and the dust extends from 0.3 to 1 of the system radius_. the dust in the shell is distributed in a _ two - phase clumpy medium _ , comprised of molecular clouds and diffuse gas , where the filling factor of the clumps is set to 0.15 and the low - density to high - density ratio",
    "is set to 0.01 .",
    "we consider the additional extreme hypothesis that dust is locally distributed in a single , _",
    "homogeneous medium_.    we assume an _ smc - like extinction curve _ and consider values of @xmath42 equal to 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 and 50 for the two - phase clumpy dust distribution and equal to 0.25 through 8 for the homogeneous one . here",
    "we recall that _ @xmath42 gives the total amount of dust _ in the shell , since the dust column density is proportional to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the characteristic grain size and @xmath70 is the density of the grain material .",
    "values of @xmath42 at the low- and high - end of the distribution seem to be characteristic of starbursts and ulirgs , respectively , at low- as well as high-@xmath6 ( e.g. vijh et al . 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "we also assume that the gas emission at a given wavelength is attenuated by the same amount as the stellar emission at that wavelength , whether the gas emission is either in a line or in the continuum .",
    "this is at odds with the result that the stellar continuum suffers roughly half of the reddening suffered by the ionized gas ( calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ; fanelli , oconnell & thuan 1988 ; mas - hesse , arnault & kunth 1989 ) but the understanding of the attenuation of the ionized - gas line emission from dust is still controversial . however , _",
    "the following results hold when no nebular emission is taken into account _ , as demonstrated in app .",
    "a.    fig .",
    "2 reproduces the attenuation curves ( normalized to v band ) for the shell dust / stars configuration and smc - type dust locally distributed in a homogeneous ( solid lines ) or two - phase clumpy medium ( dotted lines ) as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "it also shows the values of the normalized attenuation function of nearby starbursts ( calzetti et al .",
    "2000 ) , known as `` calzetti law '' , for the wg00 wavelengths ( filled triangles ) .",
    "two important results are contained in fig .",
    "first , the attenuation function for the shell geometry with a two - phase clumpy distribution of smc - type dust and @xmath71 reproduces rather well the calibrated calzetti law for nearby starbursts , as already shown by vijh et al .",
    "nevertheless a wide range of different attenuation curves may apply to individual dsgs / dpsgs , as a function of local distribution of the dust and dust content .",
    "we discuss the effect of using the empirically determined calzetti law for whatever dusty erg ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "2002a ) in app .",
    "b.    second , _ the shape of the attenuation function depends on structure of the dusty medium and , in the two - phase clumpy case , on @xmath42_. changes in normalization also exist , in both cases , of course ( not shown ) .",
    "in particular , a homogeneous dusty medium provides a larger attenuation at any wavelength than a two - phase clumpy one .",
    "in addition , we stress that _ the relation between @xmath45 and dust amount ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) is usually quite non linear and highly dependent on details of the structure of the dusty medium _ , as shown in fig .",
    "the existence of an initial `` plateau '' in @xmath45 vs. @xmath42 in the two - phase clumpy case is due to fact that individual clumps become optically thick while the low - density interclump medium initially contributes little to the reddening .",
    "finally , we note that , apart from the observationally - established attenuation function of calzetti ( 1997 ) ( see app .",
    "b ) , all the model attenuation functions considered by pm00 do not contemplate dust with smc - type extinction curve and distributed in a two - phase clumpy medium _ at the same time _",
    ", as well as a shell - like geometry .",
    "we anticipate that these important differences do not affect our re - analisys of the two - colour classification criterion for ergs .",

    "in the previous sections we have modelled the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of simple stellar populations , intended to simulate passively evolving , old ( @xmath3 ) elliptical galaxies ( es ) , and the seds of young ( @xmath46)/intermediate - age ( 0.11 gyr ) , dusty starburst galaxies ( dsgs ) and of intermediate - age , dusty post - starburst galaxies ( dpsgs ) , all at @xmath4 , as candidate extremely red objects ( eros ) .    in the early post - starburst phases ,",
    "massive stars are absent ( owing to the absence of star formation ) but intermediate - age stars are present . for these phases ,",
    "we assume that at least part of the dusty medium of the previous starburst phase survives during a maximal time - window of 0.9 gyr .",
    "we have investigated observed optical / near - ir colours and magnitudes of the previous models and , in particular , their distribution in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath2 colour  colour plane . in this colour",
    " colour diagram , pozzetti & mannucci ( 2000 ) claim that passively evolving , old stellar populations in a dust - free environment ( i.e. , elliptical galaxies ) and stellar populations produced continuously in a dusty starburst galaxy are reasonably well separated , whatever the dust / stars configuration is .",
    "this study complements the seminal analysis of pozzetti & mannucci for four main reasons .    *",
    "first , we make the new case of _ dusty post - starburst galaxies _ at @xmath4 as candidate eros . in particular , we discuss the early , dusty post - starburst phases of stellar systems formed ( mostly ) at @xmath4 , in a single burst of finite duration ( @xmath48 ) of the order of @xmath5 ( _ short burst _ ) .",
    "the results obtained for these dpsgs may be easily extended to coeval , early , dusty post - starburst phases of galaxy formation in a single burst with e.g. @xmath94 ( _ long burst _ ) , when the existence of a degeneracy between age and opacity of the models is taken into account .",
    "+ we note that the dsgs with long or short bursts under investigation sustain star formation rates ( sfrs ) of the order of @xmath52 or @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "sfrs @xmath54 have been inferred from observations of high-@xmath6 ( sub)mm sources ( e.g. , smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al . 1998 ; cimatti et al . 1998 ; eales et al . 1999 ; bertoldi et al .",
    "2000 ; lutz et al . 2001 ; smail et al .",
    "+ the presence of a considerable population of starburst galaxies with large sfrs over a short ( @xmath142 ) timescale at @xmath4 is qualitatively consistent with the interpretation of the lick absorption - line indices of nearby intermediate - mass ( i.e. , with a velocity dispersion of @xmath143 ) early - type galaxies by thomas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . *",
    "second , we explore the impact of dust attenuation ( witt et al .",
    "1992 ) on the optical / near - ir colours of dusty es at @xmath4 .",
    "* third , for all dsgs / dpsgs , we adopt a new dust / stars geometry ( witt & gordon 2000 ) and explore the impact of dust distribution ( two - phase clumpy vs. homogeneous ) and dust amount on the observed optical / near - ir colours .",
    "this geometry is consistent with observed properties of nearby starbursts and lyman break galaxies at @xmath67 . *",
    "fourth , we calculate the total emission from dust in the rest - frame mid - ir(sub)mm for dsgs / dpsgs .",
    "the distribution of model es and dsgs / dpsgs at @xmath4 in the optical / near - ir colour  magnitude and colour  colour diagrams well reproduces that of observed extremely red galaxies ( ergs ) ( sect . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "hereafter we summarise our results .    *",
    "we find that dpsgs , with ages between 0.2 and 1 gyr , at @xmath7 may mix with es at @xmath4 in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath2 colour  colour diagram , for a large range in dust amount .",
    "this holds whatever the structure ( two - phase clumpy or homogeneous ) of their dusty medium is .",
    "this result is a source of concern for the two - colour classification criterion of pozzetti & mannucci . *",
    "conversely , intermediate - age dpsgs at @xmath8 may mix with dsgs of age less than 1 gyr at @xmath4 in the same colour  colour plot , for a large range in dust amount and whatever the structure of the dusty medium is .",
    "this result and the previous one could explain in part the complexity of the erg classification recently emerged from the analysis of statistical samples of eros , where this classification was based on multi - wavelength photometry ( e.g. smail et al .",
    "2002 ; miyazaki et al . 2002 ) and not on optical / near - ir colour  colour plots . * on the other hand , we confirm the result of pozzetti & mannucci .",
    "in addition , we find that this result holds whether the dusty medium of a dsg is two - phase clumpy or homogeneous and whether high-@xmath6 ellipticals are dust - free or as dusty as nearby ones .",
    "* model es at @xmath4 populate a narrow locus in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath2 colour  colour plane , whether dusty ot not .",
    "this means that dust attenution may explain very red @xmath0 and @xmath2 colours for ellipticals at @xmath4 without the need of invoking extremely old ages and/or higher metallicities and/or higher redshifts .",
    "* the picture is the same when the distribution of the models in the @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 colour  colour plane is investigated ( cf .",
    "pozzetti & mannucci 2000 ) .",
    "hence we conclude and confirm that well - sampled seds are needed for a robust classification of ergs ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "2001 ; smail et al . 2002 ; miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) , as well as observations in x - rays ( alexander et al . 2002 ; brusa et al .",
    "2002 ; smail et al .",
    "2002 ; but see stevens et al .",
    "2003 ) , radio ( smail et al . 2002 ) and/or far - ir / submm ( cimatti et al . 1998 ; andreani et al . 1999 ; mohan et al . 2002 ) . *",
    "we find that the total rest - frame mid - ir(sub)mm luminosity ranges from @xmath10 to @xmath144 for dpsgs through dsgs .",
    "this high dynamic range is consistent with the large range in total rest - frame mid - ir(sub)mm luminosity estimated for ergs observed in the submm ( cimatti et al .",

    "this study offers two viable , not mutually exclusive interpretations to the observational results and conclusions of the previous authors .",
    "one interpretation is that re - emission by dust grains in the mid - ir(sub)mm wavelength domain depends on dust type and amount , structure of the dusty medium and dust / stars configuration , since the absorption efficiency of stellar light at given wavelength depends on these parameters .",
    "we find that the extremely red colours of dsgs / dpsgs at @xmath4 do not necessarily indicate large amounts of dust ( sect .",
    "3 ) , as instead believed for e.g. scuba submm sources , and may be reproduced under a very large range in structure of the dusty medium . hence the submm fluxes of dsgs / dpsgs at @xmath4 are not expected to be necessarily similar to those of scuba submm sources at similar / higher @xmath6 .",
    "+ the other interpretation is the reduced contribution of uv photons to dust heating in the model dpsgs , which seem to constitute a non negligible , candidate ero subpopulation .",
    "dust absorbs and scatters more efficiently uv photons than optical / near - ir ones .",
    "available optical / near - ir photons may replace available uv photons as the major source of dust heating if the optical depth at optical / near - ir wavelengths of the dusty medium is large enough . for a model dpsg , the intrinsic uv - to - optical luminosity ratio decreases towards 0 when its age approaches 1 gyr ( fig .",
    "thus ageing dpsgs will tend to have lower and lower total rest - frame mid - ir(sub)mm luminosities , for fixed dust parameters .",
    "* furthermore , for the dust - parameter space considered here , we find that only model dsgs with @xmath138 over a timescale of 100 myr may be associated with a total mid - ir(sub)mm luminosity ( in the rest frame ) greater than @xmath145 and , thus , be classified as ulirgs .",
    "conversely , model dsgs with @xmath146 over a timescale of 1 gyr typically have total mid - ir(sub)mm luminosities of a few to several @xmath140 .",
    "dpsgs may be associated with even lower values of dust emission ( down to @xmath141 ) .",
    "we conclude that the bulk of dusty , bright ( @xmath9 ) ergs is not associated with ulirgs , consistent with the conclusion of andreani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and mohan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , based on observations of a slightly brighter sample . * typical ground - based surveys with @xmath9 ( e.g. , drory et al . 2001 ; cimatti et al .",

    "* model es ( dusty or not ) at @xmath4 are always selected as eros ( if massive enough ) , whether selection is via the @xmath0 or @xmath1 colour . *",
    "conversely , selection of observable ( i.e. , with @xmath9 ) , coeval dsgs / dpsgs as eros is a complex function of the properties of their dusty medium .",
    "the explanation is that the extremely red colours ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) of model dsgs / dpsgs at @xmath4 derive from radiative transfer through their dusty media .",
    "* we find that selection via the @xmath1 colour bias the resultant sample of observable eros towards a larger ratio of es ( at any @xmath6 between 1 and 2 ) to dsgs / dpsgs at @xmath7 ; vice versa , selection via the @xmath0 colour bias it towards a larger ratio of es ( at any @xmath6 between 1 and 2 ) to dsgs / dpsgs at @xmath8 .",
    "this result confirms and complements that of yan & thompson ( 2003 ) .",
    "+ hence important discrepancies may be expected in the total number of selected eros and in the statistical properties of the different sub - populations of ergs present in a given ero sample , whether selection is via @xmath1 or @xmath0 . for example , dsgs / dpsgs at @xmath7 with the lowest amounts of dust are not selected as eros via the @xmath13 colour criterion",
