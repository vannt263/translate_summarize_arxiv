    "the modulation of the azimuthal angular distribution of the scattered x rays following he@xmath14 resonance seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitresult ] is due to the admixture of the polarized rr x rays .",
    "since the theoretical analysis of the dielectronic recombination of few  electron ions has been discussed in details previously  @xcite , here we restrict ourselves to a rather short account of the basic formulas and ideas .",
    "in particular , we consider the dr as a two  step process : @xmath38 here , the first step is the resonant capture of a free electron with energy @xmath39 and total angular momentum @xmath40 by an initial ion @xmath41 in the charge state @xmath42 .",

    "the negative degree of polarization in the case of the li@xmath11 resonance indicates that its x rays are polarized perpendicular to the reaction plane .",

    "it was shown recently that the breit interaction between the incident and the target electrons may strongly affect the alignment of the populated states and the polarization of the emitted dr x rays  @xcite .",

    "the latter case can be explained by the fact that the electron ",
    "electron interaction operator @xmath64 is scalar , and hence it can not affect the magnetic sublevel population of the excited ion if only one partial wave of the free electron is allowed in the resonant capture process .",

    "this interference depends on the free  bound transition matrix elements and , hence , on the details of the electron ",
    "electron interaction  @xcite .",
    "the breit interaction decreases the alignment parameter @xmath100 of b@xmath11 resonance by 1  % and of li@xmath11 resonance by 9  % .",

    "this noticeable change in the population of the magnetic sublevels leads to a 13 % decrease in the degree of linear polarization of x rays produced by li@xmath11 resonance .",
    "although , this represents a small contribution of the breit interaction as compared to the previously measured contributions in heavy elements  @xcite , this experiment is nonetheless sensitive enough to validate theoretical calculations including the breit interaction , and to rule out by 2@xmath101 calculations that treat the electron ",

    "small shifts in binding energies due to the breit interaction do not affect magnetic sublevel populations because the experimental electron  ion collision energy spread is large compared to these shifts .",
    "a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results of polarization of x rays due to _ kll _ dr resonances is important for developing reliable plasma polarization diagnostics .",

    "<S> we report linear polarization measurements of x rays emitted due to dielectronic recombination into highly charged krypton ions . </S>",
    "<S> the ions in the he - like through o - like charge states were populated in an electron beam ion trap with the electron beam energy adjusted to recombination resonances in order to produce _ _ k__@xmath0 x rays . </S>",
    "<S> the x rays were detected with a newly developed compton polarimeter using a beryllium scattering target and 12 silicon x - ray detector diodes sampling the azimuthal distribution of the scattered x rays . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted degrees of linear polarization of several dielectronic recombination transitions agree with results of relativistic distorted  wave calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate a high sensitivity of the polarization to the breit interaction , which is remarkable for a medium-_z _ element like krypton . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results can be used for polarization diagnostics of hot astrophysical and laboratory fusion plasmas . </S>"
