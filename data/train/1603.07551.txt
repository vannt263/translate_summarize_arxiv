    "the weakness of free - space electron - photon interactions at low photon energies ( @xmath0 ) is clearly emphasized by the correspondingly small thomson scattering cross - section @xmath1m@xmath2 .",
    "it is thus understandable that nearly seven decades went by between the proposal of electron diffraction by free light beams @xcite ( the so - called kapitza - dirac effect ) and its demonstration in a set of elegant experiments by batelaan and coworkers @xcite .",
    "periodic motion of the electron aimed by the light electric field leads to a nonzero - average transversal lorentz force due to the magnetic field , which causes elastic deflection of the electron , and consequently imprints spatial phase variations on the electron wave function .",
    "significant electron - photon coupling can occur when light is slowed down in dielectric media , essentially circumventing the large kinematic mismatch between electrons and photons at nonrelativistic energies .",
    "the resulting cherenkov radiation @xcite has been instrumental in the development of particle detectors , whereas the already demonstrated inverse cherenkov effect @xcite holds potential for electron acceleration @xcite .",
    "while these phenomena are impractical for moderate electron energies in homogeneous materials , a related effect associated with the coupling to optical modes in photonic - crystals has been demonstrated for electrons moving in vacuum through holes perforating thin films @xcite .",
    "evanescent light fields offer an efficient way to enhance electron - photon interaction .",
    "this is the principle underlying the smith - purcell effect @xcite , which in its inverse form @xcite also involves electron deflection by light fields .",
    "plasmons sustained by nanostructured conductors ( a prototypical class of evanescent fields ) , can extend toward the surrounding vacuum and enable large interaction with free electrons . as a result of this interaction , electrons can absorb previously generated plasmons @xcite and also excite plasmons that are subsequently outcoupled to cathodoluminescence light emission .",
    "the latter is widely used to spectrally and spatially map plasmons and other nanoscale optical modes @xcite .",
    "large electron - photon coupling has been recently accomplished by synchronizing short electron and laser pulses , leading to multiple energy losses and gains , as revealed in the transmitted electron spectra .",
    "this technique has been termed photon - induced near - field electron microscopy ( pinem ) @xcite . for the typical beam divergence angles used in electron microscopes ( @xmath3mrad ) ,",
    "transversal electron motion contributes negligibly to the kinetic energy , so that energy exchanges are mainly due to momentum transfers along the beam direction @xcite .",
    "in fact , an accurate description of the noted spectra only requires dealing with the electron wave function dependence on the path length @xcite .",
    "the evolution along transversal directions has been largely overlooked in this context , although it can be a source of new phenomena , such as angular momentum transfer in the interaction with optical chiral modes @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the phenomenon of electron diffraction by plasmon waves .",
    "an electron beam traversing a plasmon standing wave is predicted to undergo strong diffraction in both its elastic and inelastic outgoing components under currently feasible conditions .",
    "in contrast to the kapitza - dirac effect @xcite , mediated by the ponderomotive force of a free - space light wave , electron deflection is produced by the direct action of the electric field associated with the plasmon , without involvement of magnetic fields , and it additionally produces diffracted inelastic electron components . in our predicted electron diffraction effect ,",
    "the plasmon acts both as a phase grating ( by locally modifying the phase of the electron wave function through multiple inelastic exchanges ) and as an amplitude grating ( by shifting more probability from elastic to inelastic electron beam channels at transversal positions corresponding to maximum plasmon strength ) .",
    "interestingly , plasmon - induced electron diffraction can be scaled down to ultraconfined modes of pure quasistatic nature , involving small distances , and consequently , relatively large deflection angles .",
    "we consider an electron beam of finite lateral extension that passes near an illuminated nanostructure .",
    "the electron wave function @xmath4 evolves according to schrdinger s equation @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the free - space hamiltonian and @xmath7 describes the interaction with the optical field . for simplicity , we assume classical monochromatic light of frequency @xmath8 .",
    "we then have @xmath9 where we use the convention @xmath10 for the electric field amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "we envision a metallic nanostructure in which the near field is dominated by induced plasmons , although the present formalism can also be applied to evanescent waves confined to non - plasmonic materials . the electron kinetic energy and momentum",
    "are taken to be peaked around @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , where @xmath14 is chosen along the beam direction and @xmath15 .",
    "we contemplate a small spread in electron kinetic energy ( @xmath16 ) @xcite , which is dominated by plane wave components with wave vectors @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , each of them satisfying @xmath19 in free space .",
    "for such narrow @xmath17 distribution , we can approximate @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the peak electron velocity .",
    "this relation holds even after interaction with the optical field , under the assumption that @xmath22 ( i.e. , neglecting recoil ) .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian can thus be approximated by @xmath23 , which suggests that we recast the electron wave function as @xmath24 additionally , we replace @xmath25 by @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ hp ] ) ( i.e. , we ignore wave function gradients other than the contribution from @xmath27 ) , so that the schrdinger equation reduces to @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "now , in the absence of any interaction ( @xmath30 ) , an incident wave function of the form @xmath31 automatically satisfies eq .",
    "( [ sch2 ] ) . obviously , this only holds for small distances relative to the interaction region , as diffraction becomes important during free propagation to the far field ( see below ) .",
    "photon exchanges between the electron and the optical field modifies the electron energy in steps of @xmath32 . as a result , after several such exchanges , the electron wave function should be distributed among components grouped around a periodically spaced set of energies @xmath33 .",
    "we actually find that @xmath34 is a solution of eq .",

    ", optimum coupling occurs at @xmath97 ( maximum of @xmath95 ) , as qualitatively expected by the following argument : the plasmon field changes sign across the film [ see eq .",

    "( [ fp ] ) ] can be timed in such a way that they change sign ( for @xmath113 ) over a distance comparable to the spill out of the plasmon away from the film ( @xmath114 ) ; when this happens , the electric force experienced by the electron adds up on both sides of the film , giving rise to maximum interaction .",
    "interestingly , @xmath115 and @xmath116 can take values exceeding 10% .    in practice , a normally incident laser pulse ( duration @xmath117 ) could launch the plasmons by interacting with two parallel slits that are separated by a distance @xmath118 across a flat film region . an in - coincidence electron pulse ( duration @xmath119 )",
    "then feels the resulting plasmon standing wave @xcite . a realistic choice of parameters similar to those in recent experiments @xcite ( e.g. , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 ) satisfies the conditions that are necessary ( 1 ) for the plasmon standing wave to be well developed ( @xmath123 ) , ( 2 ) for the electron to see a nearly stationary plasmon regime ( @xmath124 ) , and ( 3 ) for the plasmon _ grating _ to exhibit a sufficient number of periods ( @xmath125 ) as to produce a few well - defined low-@xmath72 diffraction orders .",
    "additionally , as the electron wavelength is small compared with @xmath86 , an incident electron beam spanning a lateral size @xmath118 should present a negligible angular divergence @xcite . finally , the plasmon propagation distance has to be large compared with @xmath118 , a condition that is satisfied in high - quality graphene @xcite .",
    "incidentally , strong collisions with atoms in the plasmon - supporting film and inelastic scattering by phonons and other excitations could result in an electron background distribution , similar to what happens in eels and electron holography experiments .",
    "we have focused on a specific realization of electron diffraction by plasmon waves , but there are many other possible geometries .",
    "for example , one could exploit high - order plasmon standing waves of long silver nanowires such as those recently synthesized and imaged by space - resolved eels @xcite .",
    "plasmon snapshots similar to those of fig .  2 ( left ) have been already recorded in this geometry under plane wave illumination @xcite , whereas here we propose a fourier plane analysis .",
    "such nanowire geometry is compatible with an aloof beam configuration , in which the electron is not directly trespassing any material boundary , thus avoiding undesired strong collisions with target atoms , or coupling to inelastic modes ( e.g. , phonons ) .",
    "alternatively , electrons could be electrostatically deflected from a biased surface @xcite , on which a standing plasmon wave would provide the means to produce efficient electron diffraction , thus addressing a pending challenge in the coherent manipulation of low - energy free electron waves @xcite .",
    "active control of electron diffraction also appears to be possible by playing with the frequency , intensity , and symmetry of the light used to excite the plasmons , resulting in engineered plasmon waves that could for instance produce diffracted vortex electron beams @xcite .",
    "the ultrafast dynamics of plasmons adds the possibility of shaping electron diffraction with high temporal resolution .",
    "we also note that other polaritonic excitations ( e.g. , optical phonons in 2d crystals ) could be employed instead of plasmons .",
    "these ideas constitute the basis for the development of low - energy electron optics setups in which the electrons interact with evanescent light fields without the damaging effect of close encounters with bulky materials .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the spanish mineco ( mat2014 - 59096-p and sev-2015 - 0522 ) and the suisse national science foundation ( nccr grant must ) .",
