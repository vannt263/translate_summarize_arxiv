    "generating testable predictions from theories positing the existence of a multiverse remains one of the key barriers to the broader appeal of multiverse proposals .",
    "there are a variety of contemporary theoretical ideas that give rise to multiverse proposals , including those based on inflationary cosmology  @xcite , and the string theory landscape  @xcite . in each case , short of a definite prediction for parameters of interest , one expects the theory to provide a probability distribution spread over some range , out of which parameters take their values .",
    "comparisons between values that we observe and the values that are predicted by the theory through the distribution , can be used as a way of assessing the theory s predictive power , can help explain why parameters take their observed values , and can in principle help us determine whether the observed values provide support for the theory .",
    "this multifaceted role , coupling prediction , explanation and potential theory confirmation , makes the task of understanding how to compare observed values with a theory - generated probability distribution , an important step in establishing the validity of proposals for the multiverse .",
    "owing to the presumed parsimony of description that any fundamental theory of the universe is likely to exhibit , together with the complex nature of our local conditions , a probability distribution generated from theory alone may not be enough to narrow down observations that we are likely to make  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that conditionalization may be necessary to restrict the distribution in such a way that sharpens the comparison between theory and observation  @xcite .",
    "there exist a range of approaches one can take , which in effect institute successively more restricted versions of the weak anthropic principle  @xcite .",
    "the least restricted version does not conditionalize the distribution at all and has been referred to as the  bottom - up \" approach  @xcite .",
    "the most restricted version includes every piece of experimental information available , and is known as the  top - down \" approach  @xcite .",
    "an intermediate choice , which one can think of as interpolating between the two , is that of selecting a set of constraints that we believe are compatible with our existence , though not necessarily inclusive of every piece of available experimental evidence .",
    "this approach represents a way to restrict the bottom - up distribution to one that explicitly references our existence , while avoiding the complexity demanded by the top - down description , making the requisite comparison between our observations of a parameter of interest and the distribution out of which that parameter is drawn , potentially more immediate .",
    "this strategy has been termed the `` anthropic approach '' , though we will refer to anything that is not the bottom - up approach and that lies on this `` spectrum of conditionalization '' as an anthropic approach ( see aguirre and tegmark  @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of a particular conditionalization scheme may well not be enough , however .",
    "a second choice needs to be made regarding whether one believes that our observations are _ randomly _ selected from the distribution .",
    "namely , are we a typical member of the class of observers implicitly defined by the conjunction of the theory and the conditionalization scheme  @xcite ? indeed , as we will examine , the predictions of this conjunction crucially depend upon the answer that one adopts to this question .",
    "the two controversies then , regarding a suitable conditionalization scheme for a theory - generated probability distribution , and whether we can then assume we are typical of the observers implied , have shaped recent debates into the predictive power of multiverse proposals .",
    "weinstein advocates the top - down approach as the preferred method of conditionalization , and claims in that context , one can do away with the need for a stance on typicality with respect to the resulting distribution  @xcite .",
    "garriga and vilenkin support prediction based upon the presumption that we are members of a reference class of observers who have  identical information content \"  @xcite , in which case they claim that we can assume we are typical observers .",
    "srednicki and hartle argue that even within the context of conditionalization that rests on the presumption of different observers in the multiverse having identical data , assumptions about typicality need to be built - in to the theory - generated distribution , and that predictive power should thereby be evaluated in the context of a conjunction consisting of the theory , the conditionalization scheme and assumptions regarding typicality  @xcite . in a sense",
    "then , each of these three proposals operate within a scheme most similar to the top - down approach to conditionalization , but assume very different positions regarding how one should treat typicality , and therefore make radically different statements about how one should compare observations with theory .    in this paper",
    "we address this controversy from complementary points of view .",
    "we argue that conceptually , it is not clear who or what the constraints proposed in the context of top - down schemes imply , and that therefore any presumption of a lack of need to invoke a stance on typicality , or indeed the presumption of typicality itself is premature .",
    "we then show by way of a concrete example related to recent discussions about dark matter , that top - down conditionalization allows for mutually exclusive predictions regarding the number of dominant species contributing to the total dark matter density , depending upon the assumptions one makes about typicality . in this way ,",
    "one s stance on typicality strongly influences the prediction , and then an incorrect presumption about the former can translate into a misunderstanding about the latter .",
    "we thereby side with srednicki and hartle in proposing that if one is interested in extracting predictions from theory - generated probability distributions via top - down reasoning , one must explicitly include an exhaustive set of typicality assumptions in the analysis  @xcite .",
    "without such an approach , anthropic reasoning may play little role in helping to extract predictions from multiverse proposals .",
    "there exist multiverse scenarios within the context of both inflationary cosmology and string theory that give rise to physical conditions in which our domain ( or universe ) is unlikely . rather than consequently dismissing these scenarios by virtue of them not being predictive ( of our domain ) , the weak anthropic principle ( wap )",
    "can be invoked to help refine the analysis of their predictive power .",
    "this principle was introduced by carter in 1974 , in the context of attempting to explain coincidences between cosmological parameters .",

    "show that in at least one ( rather stylized ) theoretical example , conditionalizing one s distribution in a way that accords with the top - down approach gives results that clearly depend upon whether one assumes typicality with respect to the reference class implicitly invoked .",

    "aguirre and tegmark go on to claim that although the exponents @xmath29 may be different , rendering many fewer dominant dark matter components than @xmath13 , in the absence of any further information , there is an argument that can be made that they are in fact similar , and that thereby there could be many components that contribute to the total dark matter density .    in this fashion",
    ", they conclude that under top - down conditionalization , that is , where one conditionalizes the distribution based on one s observations ( in this case , the total dark matter density ) , one predicts the existence of several dark matter species , contributing roughly equally to the total dark matter density .",

    "sufficiently far away from optimality then , the conclusion of the existence of multiple dark matter species contributing equally to the total observed dark matter density breaks down , and the prediction takes a new form .",
    "what we can expect to observe , depends upon whether we assume we will observe typical values from the distribution .",
    "though perhaps this is to be expected , our point is that this holds even in the case of top - down conditionalization , namely , that assumptions regarding typicality play a role in the case most similar in spirit to the style of reasoning endorsed by weinstein s @xmath1 . for the sake of completeness , we ll show that this result also holds in the case where we let @xmath52 .",
    "in the general case @xmath54 , combining equations  ( [ eqn : td_powerlaw ] ) and ( [ eqn : td_maxdensity ] ) gives , @xmath55 we ll again perform calculations in the case where the power law exponents have the same value , i.e. , @xmath56 , for @xmath57 .",
    "noting then that @xmath58 , @xmath59 to investigate the behaviour of this function , we ll explore the possibility of @xmath60 being the dominant contributing species for @xmath61 , though the argument works for any species @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we ll monitor the density @xmath42 as it deviates from its optimal value of @xmath62 , where this deviation is controlled by a parameter @xmath51 : @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we re thereby exploring the possibility of @xmath42 dominating with each of the other components being reduced by an equivalent amount with respect to their optimal values , such that the constraint @xmath66 is satisfied",

    "we see there that for appropriately low values of the fractional probability ( depending of course upon @xmath49 ) , one can make the dark matter species with density @xmath42 dominate over the others .",
    "as @xmath69 gets larger , @xmath42 dominates by a relatively smaller amount when compared with lower @xmath69 values . for example , if @xmath70 , then @xmath71 ( focusing only on the solution where @xmath42 dominates ) , giving @xmath72 . on the other hand , @xmath73 , giving @xmath74 .",

    "garriga and vilenkin s claim about the legitimacy of presuming typicality with respect to reference classes that share all of our information content ( and a small subset of this information content in more concrete settings ) is subject to the same concern regarding our ignorance about who or what this prescription implies .",
    "this problem becomes more acute if as we have shown in the restricted example of section  [ sec : typicality and dark matter ] , the typical members of the distribution see one thing while the atypical members see another . in the particular context",
    "considered there , demanding a low fractional probability , i.e. , demanding parameters sample from an atypical region of the probability distribution , leads ( under appropriate constraints ) to the possibility of a single dominant dark matter species .",
    "this prediction differs from the case where we accept only the most probable ( or under the appropriate conditions , typical ) dark matter densities as those that set the prediction .    in a sense ,",
    "our argument here is in accord with what one might expect intuitively .",
    "abstracting away from more likely scenarios is nt a priori inconsistent with obtaining a different result .",

    "<S> we argue contrary to recent claims that it is not clear one can either dispense with notions of typicality altogether or presume typicality , in comparing resulting probability distributions with observations . </S>",
    "<S> we show in a concrete , top - down setting related to dark matter , that assumptions about typicality can dramatically affect predictions , thereby providing a guide to how errors in reasoning regarding typicality translate to errors in the assessment of predictive power . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that this dependence on typicality is an integral feature of anthropic reasoning in broader cosmological contexts , and argue in favour of the explicit inclusion of measures of typicality in schemes invoking anthropic reasoning , with a view to extracting predictions from multiverse scenarios . </S>"
