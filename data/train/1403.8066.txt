    "non - axisymmetric deformations of rapidly rotating self - gravitating bodies are a rather generic phenomenon in nature and could appear in a variety of astrophysical scenarios like stellar core collapses  @xcite , accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs  @xcite , or the merger of two neutron stars  @xcite . over the years , a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the search of unstable deformations that , starting from an axisymmetric configuration , can lead to the formation of highly deformed rapidly rotating massive objects  @xcite .",
    "such deformations would lead to an intense emission of high - frequency gravitational waves ( i.e. in the khz range ) , potentially detectable on earth by next - generation gravitational - wave detectors such as advanced ligo  @xcite , advanced virgo and kagra  @xcite in the next decade  @xcite .    from the observational point of view , it is import to get any insight on the possible astrophysical scenarios where such instabilities ( unstable deformation ) are present . it is well known that rotating neutron stars are subject to non - axisymmetric instabilities for non - radial axial modes with azimuthal dependence @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) when the instability parameter @xmath6 ( i.e. the ratio between the kinetic rotational energy @xmath7 and the gravitational potential energy @xmath8 ) exceeds a critical value @xmath3 .",
    "the instability parameter plays an important role in the study of the so - called dynamical bar - more instability , i.e. the @xmath9 instability which takes place when @xmath1 is larger than a threshold  @xcite .",
    "previous results for the onset of the classical bar - mode instability have already showed that the critical value @xmath3 for the onset of the instability is not an universal quantity and it is strongly influenced by the rotational profile  @xcite , by relativistic effects  @xcite , and , in a quantitative way , by the compactness  @xcite .    however , up to now , significant evidence of their presence when realistic equation of state ( eos ) are consider is still missing .",
    "for example in @xcite , using the unified sly eos  @xcite , was shown the presence of shear - instability but no sign of the classical bar - mode instability and of its critical behavior have been found .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to get more insight on the behavior of the classical bar - mode instability when the matter is described by a stiffer more realistic eos .",
    "the investigation in the literature on its dependence on the stiffness of eos usually focused on the values of @xmath2 ( i.e. the adiabatic index of a polytropic eos ) in the range between @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite , while the expected value for a real neutron star is more likely to be around @xmath0 at least in large portions of the interior .",
    "such a choice for the eos has already been implemented in the past  @xcite , even quite recently  @xcite , with the aim of maintaining the simplicity of a polytropic eos and yet obtaining properties that resemble a more realistic case . indeed , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eoss ] , a polytropic eos with @xmath12 and @xmath0 is qualitatively similar to the shen proposal  @xcite in the density interval between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for the sake of completeness , in fig .",

    "the evolution equations for the matter follow from the conservation laws for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath27 and the baryon number @xmath28 , closed by an eos of the type @xmath29 .    in order to generate the initial data we evolve in this work",

    "this choice of parameters has the property to closely reproduce the behavior of the shen eos in the interior of a real neutron star ( see fig .  [",

    "we also define the fluid three - velocity @xmath45 as the velocity measured by a local zero - angular momentum observer ( @xmath46 ) , while the lorentz factor is @xmath47 . within this formalism , the conservation of the baryon number suggests the use of the conserved variable @xmath48 with the property that @xmath49 along the time - evolution @xmath36 .    , scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the initial data of our simulations are computed as stationary equilibrium solutions for axisymmetric and rapidly rotating relativistic stars in polar coordinates  @xcite . in generating these equilibrium models we assumed that the metric describing the axisymmetric and stationary relativistic star has the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are space - dependent metric functions .",

    "notice that the definitions of quantities such as @xmath65 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 are meaningful only in the case of stationary axisymmetric configurations and should therefore be treated with care once the rotational symmetry is lost .",

    "the initial conditions for the evolution have been generated using the nicholas stergioulas rns code  @xcite .",
    "any model can be uniquely determined ( once the value of the differential rotation parameter has been fixed to @xmath68 ) by two parameters .",
    "we decided to denote each of the generated models using the values of the conserved baryonic mass @xmath62 and the @xmath1 parameter at @xmath69 .",
    "as a consequence of this choice , in the rest of this paper we will refer to a particular model using the following notation .",
    "for example , m1.5b0.270 will denote a model with a conserved baryonic mass @xmath70 and a value of the instability parameter @xmath71 .",
    "one of the main features of the generated models is that , due to the high rotation , not all of them have the maximum of the density at the center of the star . for example , if we analyze some of the generated models with a fixed value of the baryonic mass @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : densitym2 ] ) , we note that those rotating fastest have the maximum of the density at a distance of their center which is around @xmath73 km .",
    "this means that most of the studied models are characterized by a _",
    "toroidal _ configuration (",
    "i.e. the maximum of the density is not on the rotational axis ) .",
    "as we will see , there is no correlation between having a toroidal configuration and being unstable against the dynamical bar - mode instability , like in the case of polytropic models with @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "axis we report the compactness of each stellar model , while its rotation parameter @xmath1 is on the @xmath74 axis .",
    "squares denote models that are not subject to the bar - mode instability while circles represent the ones that are bar - mode ( @xmath75=@xmath76 ) unstable .",

    "we also shaded , with the corresponding color , the initial part of the corotation bands . for any value of the frequency of a mode between these two lines",
    "there is exactly one radius inside the star which is co - rotating with the mode .",
    "[ fig : corotation_band],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    an important issue related to the use of polytropic eos in the construction of the initial models is that their properties are fixed in terms of physical scales determined by the value of the polytropic constant @xmath81 that can always be set to @xmath82 by changing the measure units .",
    "the assertion that we are generating a model with a giving baryonic mass @xmath62 is therefore related to the actual value chosen for @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , in order to claim that the threshold for the instability depends on the stiffness of the eos , we need to eliminate the dependencies on the dimensional scales and then on the chosen value of the polytropic constant @xmath81 . an efficient way to do that is to extrapolate the result for @xmath83 , which corresponds to the newtonian limit , where the general relativistic effects can be neglected . indeed , using the same procedure followed in  @xcite",
    ", we chose five sequences of constant rest - mass density models , namely with @xmath84 . again in analogy with  @xcite , we use a rotational profile with @xmath85 for all models .",

    "the straight line represents the result of the fit ( as a function of @xmath1 ) for the whole sequence of models at fixed value of the conserved baryonic mass @xmath92 and at resolution @xmath93 .",
    "the open triangles represent the values of two different models among them .",
    "[ fig : tau_resolution],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    while the overall dynamics is very similar for all resolutions , there is a consistent shift of the value of the @xmath1 parameter at the beginning of the development of the instability @xmath94 and of the value of the fitted growth time @xmath95 with increasing resolution .",
    "more precisely , the analysis of the initial stage of the evolution shows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_evolution_res ] ) that there is indeed a drift ( decrease ) of the value of @xmath1 and , consequently , the fit of @xmath95 is sensible to the value used for a given resolution .",
    "this can , at least partially , be explained to be due to the fact that by the time the amplitude of the mode reaches the fit - window , the evolution does not correspond any longer to the original model but it is closer to a new equilibrium model ( through an adiabatic drift ) , characterized by a different value of the rotational parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the overall conclusion is that one has to be careful when associating the fitted value for the growth time of the instability to the initial value of the rotational parameter @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , as it can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : beta_evolution_res ] , there is a small shift ( of as much as 2% for the lowest resolution ) of the value of @xmath1 from the start of the simulation up to the time at which the instability is detected ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "using this fact , we now report in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau_resolution ] the growth - time and the @xmath1 at the beginning of the instability for each resolution and the critical fit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : res_fits ] ) for @xmath92 .",
    "that shows we have convergence in the determination of the parameter of the classical bar - mode instability above the threshold , if we use the value @xmath94 to perform the extrapolations .",
    "while these results show that the used resolution is enough to explore the dynamical bar - mode instability , we can not draw such conclusion on the parameter of the observed shear - instability at lower @xmath1 . despite",
    "that we did observe that such instabilities are present , the resolution used here is not sufficient to draw conclusions about their numerical values .",
    "we note that we found candidates of @xmath9 shear instability when examining several models in different resolutions , but the instability dynamics can not be clearly singled out with respect to other instabilities that seem to be present .",
    "one example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : m25b200res ] , which shows that the interplay on the growth of various modes shows some dependency on the resolution .",
    "such dependency was not observed in the cases where the classical dynamical bar - mode instability is present and it is by far the fastest growing mode .    , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this shows that for these values of @xmath1 the used resolution on the finer grid of @xmath93 is not enough to determine the dynamics of the shear instability .",
    "this initial analysis show that a resolution of , at least , @xmath97 is needed .",
    "moreover , in this case , the use of the numerical discretization error to triggering the fastest growing mode does not seem to be the best strategy to study shear instabilities when a competition between different @xmath75 modes ( like @xmath9 and @xmath98 ) is present .",
    "we will leave a detailed study of the low-@xmath99 instabilities to a future work .",
    "we have presented a study of the dynamical bar - mode instability in differentially rotating nss in full general relativity for a wide and systematic range of values of the rotational parameter @xmath1 and the conserved baryonic mass @xmath62 , using a polytropic / ideal - fluid eos characterized by a value of the adiabatic index @xmath0 , which allows us to resemble the properties of a realistic eos . in particular , we have evolved a large number of ns models belonging to five different sequences with a constant rest - mass ranging from @xmath100 to @xmath101 , with a fixed degree of differential rotation ( @xmath58 ) and with many different values of @xmath1 in the range @xmath102 $ ] .    for all the models with a sufficiently high initial value of @xmath1 we observe the expected exponential growth of the @xmath9 mode which is characteristic of the development of the dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "we compute the growth time @xmath95 for each of these bar - mode unstable models by performing a nonlinear least - square fit using a trial function for the quadrupole moment of the matter distribution .",
    "the growth time clearly depends on both the rest - mass and the rotation and in particular we find that the relation between the instability parameter @xmath1 and the inverse square of @xmath95 , for each sequence of constant rest - mass , is linear .",
    "this allows us to extrapolate the threshold value @xmath3 for each sequence corresponding to the growth time going to infinity , using the same procedure already employed in @xcite .",
    "once the five values of @xmath3 have been computed , we are able to extrapolate the critical value of the instability parameter for the newtonian limit , which is found to be @xmath103 . this value can be directly compared with the one found in @xcite for the `` standard '' @xmath104 case , which is @xmath105 .",
    "our results suggest that , even if one can now consider just two values for the adiabatic index , namely the values @xmath106 , considered in the present work , and @xmath104 , considered in @xcite , the use of a stiffer , more realistic eos should be expected to have the effect of reducing the threshold for the onset of the dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "unfortunately , the actual reduction of the threshold @xmath3 is just of the order of @xmath107 , and indeed this reduction does not lead to a significantly higher probability for it to occur in real astrophysical scenarios .",
    "we also evolved many models belonging to the same five sequences but having lower values of the instability parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we find that many of them show the growth of one or more modes even though their initial value of @xmath1 is below the threshold for the onset of the dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "the modes that show a growth are mainly @xmath9 and the @xmath98 .",
    "we compute the frequencies of these growing modes and compare them with the corotation band for their progenitor models , finding that all those frequencies are within this band .",
    "we can conclude that such instabilities have to be defined as _ shear instabilities _ , as the ones that were already observed in @xcite .    unfortunately , we are not able to measure their growth time , since their dynamics change significantly by changing the resolution of the simulations .",
    "in fact , while at a coarse resolution we usually observe only one mode growing exponentially , when improving the resolution other modes develop as well and the interplay between these prevent a clear exponential growth of only one mode which could dominate the evolution .    in order to make a quantitative assessment about this phenomenon",
    ", either much higher resolution has to be used to see if one of the modes is able to dominate , or seed perturbations have to be introduced with the aim of selecting only a particular mode at a time .",
    "we leave this treatment to futures studies .",
