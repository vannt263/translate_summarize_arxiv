    "let us remind the differential equations on time scales , proposed by hilger @xcite .",
    "the main element of the equations is the time scale , which is understood as a nonempty closed subset , @xmath0 of the real numbers . on a time scale",
    "@xmath1 the functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 are called the forward and backward jump operators , respectively .",
    "the point @xmath4 is called right - scattered if @xmath5 and right - dense if @xmath6 similarly , it is called left - scattered if @xmath7 and left - dense if @xmath8    the @xmath9derivative of a continuous function @xmath10 at a right - scattered point is defined as @xmath11 and at a right - dense point it is defined as @xmath12 if the limit exists .",
    "a differential equation @xmath13 is said to be a differential equation on time scale , where function @xmath14 in ( [ tsde ] ) is assumed to be rd - continuous on @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "if a point @xmath16 is right - dense , then the @xmath17-derivative is the ordinary derivative . otherwise , @xmath4 is a right - scattered point , and the @xmath17-derivative is defined by means of the quotient .",
    "let us discuss the second case more attentively . by the definition of the @xmath9derivative",
    ", assuming that @xmath16 is not an isolated point , one has that @xmath18 now , compare this expression with the numerical approximation of the function on the interval @xmath19.$ ] setting @xmath20 and @xmath21 we have that @xmath22 thus , one can see that the idea of the @xmath9derivative , as well as of the @xmath23derivative is close to the basic one for the numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "see figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for illustration .",
    "that is , in its heart the concept of the differential equations on time scales is closely adjoint with numerical methods .",
    "however , for numerical methods , of course as far as the definition in @xmath24 is considered , smaller @xmath25 gives a better approximation . in the former theory of differential equations on time scales , the request was not considered , and the elements of linear change over the intervals near right - scattered ( left - scattered ) points are strong there . to return the non - linearity sense in the discussion , one needs to modify the equations . in our papers",
    "@xcite , the concept of transition conditions were proposed , when we consider the simple version of the time scale as a union of disjoint sections . in @xcite ,",
    "these systems emerge as an auxiliary instrument of a discontinuous dynamical system investigation . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we generalize this idea for all possible time scales .",
    "in this part we shall answer two questions : why the differential equations on time scales are needed by real world problems ? how the hilger s equations can be extended for these ?",
    "consider a real world process , which can be symbolically given as a function @xmath26 where @xmath16 is from a time scale .",
    "suppose for this moment that the time scale admits only non - isolated moments .",
    "if the time is increasing , we have to prescribe what the value at @xmath27 is equal to for the right - scattered point @xmath28 in hilger s theory , the value is evaluated by using the derivative of @xmath29 at the moment @xmath30 and this is very restrictive , since the difference @xmath25 is not supposed to be small !",
    "it is reasonable to assume that there exists more general law of transition for @xmath29 from the moment @xmath16 to @xmath31 in general , it can be given with a function @xmath32 we call this expression as the transition condition .",
    "to illustrate , consider a population developing in time .",
    "we may assume that the size satisfies a local law in some borders , say in summer time , and it is not under the law in winter time .",
    "moreover , the local law in winter time is not known .",
    "nonetheless , we can evaluate the change in the time , that is the size at the beginning of the season and that at the end of the season .",
    "assume that the change satisfies a new formula , which is naturally a discrete one .",
    "in that case , we come to the idea of the equations on time scales , but more general than those investigated before .",
    "consider the time scale @xmath33 given above , and the same @xmath9derivative of a continuous function @xmath10 defined by ( [ dd1 ] ) and ( [ dd2 ] ) .",
    "denote by @xmath34 the set of all right - scattered points of @xmath35 consider a function @xmath36 which is assumed to be rd - continuous on @xmath37 define a function @xmath38 now , on the time scale , we introduce a piecewise function @xmath39 which is equal to the function @xmath40 if @xmath16 is a right - dense point , and it is equal to @xmath41 if @xmath16 is a right - scattered point . we suggest to consider the following differential equation on the time scale @xmath42    condition that all solutions are continuous on the time scale should be assumed .    to demonstrate the opportunities , which one can have with the newly introduced equations , consider the following theorem of existence and uniqueness .",
    "let @xmath43 be a time scale , @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 and put @xmath49 suppose that @xmath50 is rd - continuous , bounded with bound @xmath51 lipschitz continuous with lipschitz constant @xmath52 and @xmath53 for all @xmath54 and @xmath55 then the ivp @xmath56 has exactly one solution on @xmath57,$ ] where @xmath58 if @xmath59 and @xmath60 then the unique solution exists on the interval @xmath61.$ ] [ thmeu ]    one could compare the last assertion with the following , from @xcite .",
    "the condition on the transition function @xmath62 is added , in this particular case . in general",
    ", properties of the function will generate new theoretical , and what is most important , application prospects for these equations .",
    "one can see that many results in the theory , which have been obtained earlier can , now , be generalized , for newly proposed systems with additional interesting properties that transition conditions can admit .",
    "another opportunity is to consider state - dependent time scales @xcite .",
    "let a set @xmath63 in @xmath64 be given , such that for each @xmath65 the projection of the intersection , @xmath66 of the line @xmath67 with @xmath68 on the time axis is a time scale in the sense of hilger .",
    "thus , one can define the function @xmath69 for each point @xmath70 we assume that the function @xmath71 is continuous in @xmath72 if the moment @xmath16 is such that @xmath73 is right - dense in the correspond time scale , @xmath74 then the @xmath9derivative is defined by ( [ dd2 ] ) .",
    "otherwise it is equal to @xmath75 now , define a function @xmath76 which is equal to a continuous function @xmath77 at a right - dense point @xmath78 and to function @xmath79 if the point is a right - scattered one .",
    "then , one can discuss the following equation @xmath80 it is obvious that the equations with state - dependent time scales can also play a certain role in this theory , and they will be used in the modeling of real world problems .",
    "the analysis may be of great interest , since new opportunities related to the non - linear properties of the time scales will emerge .",
    "finally , we want to mention that very profitable ways for differential equations on time scales is to investigate them together with different types of discontinuities .",
    "these days there are several well extended theories such that systems with discontinuities in the right - hand - side , arguments , impulsive differential equations .",
    "they are realized in very interesting application projects as well @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we are sure that integration of the methods and results of these theories with above mentioned extensions of differential equations on time scales can provide really interesting horizons , which can give a light on new ways for modeling processes in mechanics , electronics , medicine , biology .",
    "one of the particular results in this sense is our recent paper @xcite , where certain class of differential equations on time scales is embedded in differential equations with fixed moments of impulses .",
