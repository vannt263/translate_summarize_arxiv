    "the hubbard model has been employed for a long time as the conceptually simplest model which might explain metallic ferromagnetism of itinerant electrons @xcite and localization due to coulomb repulsion @xcite . unlike initially expected",
    ", this model does not easily yield ferromagnetism on the hypercubic lattice and some additional conditions have to be satisfied to stabilize a ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase .",
    "as one of very few exact result in this many - body problem , nagaoka established long ago @xcite that in the limit of infinite local coulomb interaction @xmath3 , a single hole doped into a half - filled system leads to the fm ground state .",
    "there are several indications that this remains valid for a finite concentration of holes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the ground state of the hubbard model on the square lattice may only be fm for values of @xmath4 far larger than the bandwidth @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism may be also promoted by a particular lattice or band structure @xcite , or even by disorder @xcite .",
    "lieb first showed that a half - filled flat band induces a net magnetization @xcite .",
    "furthermore , hirsch and others have focused on the effect of additional off - diagonal matrix elements of the coulomb interaction @xcite .    a major step towards understanding the physics of metallic ferromagnetism in transition metals such as fe , co , and ni , was the suggestion that orbital degeneracy might play a crucial role .",
    "it was first pointed out by slater , statz , and koster @xcite and then stressed by van vleck @xcite that in the presence of degenerate orbitals , hund s exchange coupling @xmath2 favours local triplet spin configurations of two electrons occupying different orbitals .",
    "this has important consequences for ferromagnetism as local moments are formed and thus @xmath2 helps to stabilize magnetic phases , including the fm one @xcite .",
    "roth examined the doubly degenerate model at quarter - filling in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "she found that the ground state is a spin triplet and orbital singlet for two sites , i.e. , the system forms an orbital superlattice structure in which two sublattices have different orbitals occupied by electrons at each of them .",
    "this interrelation between staggered orbital order and spin ferromagnetism was next emphasized by kugel and khomskii @xcite who derived an effective strong coupling hamiltonian with coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom , extended further by cyrot and lyon - caen @xcite by on - site pair hopping , and by inagaki @xcite .",
    "these seminal papers started a new field  spin - orbital physics in correlated transition metal oxides @xcite , where superexchange models derived in the strong coupling regime provide a theoretical background for understanding both magnetic and optical properties @xcite .",
    "numerous spin - orbital models have been derived in the regime of large coulomb interactions , both with @xmath0 @xcite and with @xmath1 @xcite orbital degrees of freedom and are currently investigated .    while systems of higher dimensionality are clearly the ones of most interest @xcite , significant insight into the complementary behaviour of spin and orbital degrees of freedom was obtained in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) model .",
    "indeed , many of essential features of such 1d systems were established by quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies @xcite , the combination of these two approaches @xcite , and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite .",
    "spin , charge , and orbital correlations in the 1d hubbard model with @xmath1 orbitals at several densities have been also examined in a very recent study by xavier _",
    "@xcite , which combines dmrg and the lanczos technique .",
    "unfortunately , in a vast majority of studies , a conceptually simplified model , i.e. , the degenerate hubbard model with equivalent orbitals @xcite or at best with different bandwidth obtained with diagonal hopping @xcite , has been investigated so far .",
    "however , it has been recently shown within dynamical mean field theory that a finite on - site hybridization between orbitals enhances the charge and orbital fluctuations and plays a significant role especially for the orbital - selective mott transition @xcite .",
    "in fact , a proper description of a system with @xmath0 orbitals involves a more complex kinetic energy hamiltonian as in this case the orbital flavour during the intersite hopping is not conserved , and this is likely to lead to partial orbital polarization which is expected to strongly modify the magnetic instabilities @xcite , resulting in a rich phase diagram . in addition only little is known in analytic form about these models , besides expansions in @xmath5 around the atomic limit which result into the celebrated goodenough - kanamori rules @xcite and spin - orbital models . in particular cases , such as half - filling in two - band models ,",
    "they corroborate the results obtained from weak coupling approaches , and therefore gaining further qualitative insight into the corresponding problems is unlikely . in contrast , at quarter filling , weak coupling approaches are at odd with the strong coupling expansions @xcite , and the situation remains controversial .",
    "fortunately this situation can be studied rigorously on the analytical level , both for @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals , in a two - site molecule .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , we introduce a _ realistic _ model with two @xmath0 orbitals and compared it with the one for @xmath1 orbitals in .",
    "secondly , the solutions for both models are given and compared with each other in .",
    "thereby , we identify characteristic differences in the behaviour of both orbital degrees of freedom @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "in we verify whether the phenomenon of a complementary behaviour of the spin and orbital flavours is also a characteristic feature of this particular case by analyzing spin and pseudospin correlation functions .",
    "comparisons to strong coupling expansions are presented as well .",
    "next , in we investigate the influence of finite crystal field splitting on the ground state properties .",
    "finally , summarizes the paper and gives general conclusions .",
    "the magnetic and orbital instabilities within the @xmath0 band become especially relevant in the context of doped nickelates la@xmath6sr@xmath7nio@xmath8 ( lsno ) , where interesting novel phases including the stripe order were discovered @xcite . even though doped nickelate lsno is isostructural with its cuprate counterpart la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 , its electronic degrees of freedom are more complicated .",
    "in fact , a realistic hamiltonian for lsno must contain , besides the @xmath9 orbital states deciding about the properties of the cuprates , also the @xmath10 orbital states , so as to account for the actual filling with two holes and for the high - spin state ( @xmath11 ) in the stoichiometric compound . such a model of interacting @xmath0 electrons in ( @xmath12 ) plane may be written as follows , @xmath13 with two orbital flavours : @xmath14 and @xmath15 forming a basis in the orbital space . the kinetic energy is described by , @xmath16 where @xmath5 stands for an effective @xmath17 hopping matrix element due to the hybridization with oxygen orbitals on ni@xmath18o@xmath18ni bonds , and the off - diagonal hopping @xmath19 along @xmath20 and @xmath21 axis depends on the phase of the @xmath22 orbital along the considered cubic direction .    for our purpose",
    "it is most convenient to consider an @xmath0 orbital basis consisting of a directional orbital @xmath23 along the molecular bond and a planar orbital @xmath24 orthogonal to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "pairs of such orthogonal orbitals defining a new basis might be obtained by the following transformation of the original orbital basis @xmath25 , @xmath26 with the angle @xmath27 depending on whether one considers the bond along @xmath20 or @xmath21 axis .",
    "this rotation leads to a simple diagonal form of the hopping matrix , @xmath28 allowing only for intersite transitions between two directional @xmath23 orbitals along each bond @xcite .",
    "we compare this case with a frequently studied degenerate hubbard model with equivalent orbitals .",
    "such a model describes the dynamics of two active @xmath1 orbitals , e.g. , for a molecular bond along @xmath20 axis , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , so that the hopping matrix is diagonal , @xmath31 the electron - electron interactions are described by the on - site terms , which we write in the following form @xcite , @xmath32 here @xmath4 and @xmath2 stand for the intraorbital coulomb and hund s exchange elements , whereas @xmath33 is the electron density at site @xmath34 in @xmath35 orbital state .    the last term @xmath36 stands for the uniform crystal - field splitting between @xmath22 and @xmath37 orbitals along the @xmath38 axis , @xmath39 the splitting of two @xmath0 orbitals occurs due to the tetragonal jahn - teller distortion of the nio@xmath40 octahedron . in la@xmath41nio@xmath8 , however , the octahedron , with the ni@xmath18o@xmath18ni bond lengths being 1.95 ( 2.26 )   in - plane ( out - of - plane ) @xcite , respectively , is much less distorted than the cuo@xmath40 octahedron with 1.89 and 2.43   bond lengths in la@xmath41cuo@xmath8 @xcite , which reflects the difference in electron filling . in what follows",
    "we consider only a realistic positive @xmath42 favouring , due to elongated octahedra , the @xmath37 occupancy over the @xmath22 occupancy by the @xmath0 electrons in doped compounds .",
    "in this section we present an exact solution of a two - site molecule at quarter filling with two degenerate orbitals of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "although it is straightforward to solve the present problem numerically , it is more instructive to find the solution analytically . along this process",
    "several important aspects will be clarified .    while the total spin operator commutes with the hamiltonian and its @xmath43-component",
    "can be used to label the eigenstates this does not hold for the total orbital pseudospin operator @xmath44 , where its three components are given by , @xmath45 in order to distinguish the third component of the pseudospin from that conventionally used for a bond along @xmath38 axis ( @xmath46 ) , we have labelled it with the @xmath47 index .",
    "note however that in contrast to the spin operator , the @xmath47-component of the pseudospin operator , @xmath48 does not commute with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_deg ] ) , so the states with different values of this observable mix with each other .",
    "nevertheless , we will use its eigenvalues together with the @xmath43-component @xmath49 of the total spin operator @xmath50 to specify multiparticle states in terms of which we write the hamiltonian .",
    "it is straightforward to construct explicitly all 28 states ; they are listed in [ ap : states ] .    in the high - spin subspaces @xmath51 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_deg ] ) is decomposed into a zero @xmath52 matrix @xmath53 involving the two @xmath54 states with @xmath55 , and two @xmath52 matrices : @xmath56 and , @xmath57 now we are left with the @xmath58 subspace . in the @xmath11 sector one",
    "recovers the same eigenenergies : two zeros corresponding to the above @xmath55 localized states with @xmath55 , and the eigenvalues following from the matrices @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . in the @xmath61 subspace , using the states with @xmath55 , the following hamiltonian matrices are found in addition : @xmath62 and , @xmath63 finally , in the sector with @xmath64 , the hamiltonian matrices read , @xmath65    @xmath66      let us consider first a model with two active and equivalent @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "the third orbital may be neglected in various contexts : ( @xmath34 ) either in a @xmath67 configuration when a crystal field raises the energy of the third orbital above the other two we consider , or ( @xmath68 ) in a @xmath69 low spin configuration when a crystal field lowers the energy of the third orbital below the other two ( the former one being filled ) , or ( @xmath70 ) in a @xmath71 low spin configuration when a crystal field lowers the energy of the third orbital below the other two in which case one meets the problem of one hole in two orbitals . from the few layered perovskites that may correspond to these cases",
    "let us mention ndsrcro@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we note that the distortions in layered perovskites differ from the ones in cubic perokskites , where they are typically trigonal . for this model",
    "every matrix in equations - can be easily diagonalized and the corresponding eigenvalues are listed in the [ ap : t2 g ] .",
    "for clarity we have used the symmetry and classified them into triplet ( @xmath11 ) and singlet ( @xmath61 ) subspaces .    to get more insight into the competition between the tendencies towards the antiferromagnetic ( af ) and fm ground states , we now discuss the lowest energy eigenstates in the strong coupling ( large @xmath4 ) limit .",
    "as expected , the lowest energy , @xmath72 obtained by the diagonalization of the matrix in equation , belongs to spin triplet coexisting with the pseudospin singlet . in the case of strong on - site",
    "interorbital repulsion , the lowest high - spin energy reads , @xmath73 note however that finite @xmath2 could significantly reduce the value of the interorbital repulsion @xmath74 , so that it would no longer be much larger than @xmath5 . as a consequence , significant corrections to the above result obtained to second order in @xmath75",
    "are expected in this case .",
    "analogously , the lowermost low - spin energy results from the matrix in equation , which is degenerate with the one obtained from the matrix in equation , @xmath76 in the strong coupling regime .",
    "comparison of equation ( [ eq : slow ] ) with the lowest high - spin energy given by equation ( [ eq : tlow ] ) allows one to draw interesting conclusions about conditions required for ferromagnetism .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath77 and @xmath78 are degenerate for @xmath79 .",
    "however , even infinitesimally small @xmath80 lifts this degeneracy and might give rise to spin ferromagnetism combined with the alternating orbital ( ao ) pseudospin correlation .",
