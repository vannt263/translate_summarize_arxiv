    "high - magnification microlensing events present a rare opportunity to obtain high resolution spectra of otherwise extremely faint dwarfs in the galactic bulge , which would require of order 100 hours of observations on 8 m class telescopes under ordinary circumstances .",
    "microlensing is itself very rare , with only a fraction @xmath9 of stars being microlensed at any given time , even toward the galactic bulge where the density of lenses is exceptionally high .",
    "events that are magnified by a factor @xmath4 are rarer still by a factor @xmath10 . and",
    "finally , the high - magnification lasts only @xmath11 , where @xmath12days is the einstein timescale of the event .",
    "so there are formidable problems predicting high - magnification episodes sufficiently far in advance to arrange spectroscopic observations from 8 m class telescopes .",
    "nevertheless , two groups , microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) and the optical gravitational lens experiment ( ogle ) find a total of about 800 microlensing events per year , of which the microlensing follow up networkmicrofun/ ] ( @xmath13fun ) is able to identify about 10 as high - magnification events . during the 2008 season",
    ", the additional challenges posed by getting spectra on short notice were overcome for three of these events , bringing the total number of bulge dwarfs with high - magnification spectra to seven .",
    "there are four published analyses : ogle2006blg265s  @xcite , ogle2007blg349s   @xcite , moa2006blg099s   @xcite , and ogle2008-blg209s  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a spectrum of ogle-2007-blg-514s taken by m. rauch and g. becker with an as yet unpublished analysis by c.  epstein et al ..    here we analyze the two remaining high - mag bulge - dwarf spectra from the 2008 season , moa2008blg310s  and moa2008blg311s , which , remarkably , peaked on successive nights over africa and were both observed as they were falling from their peak at the beginning of the chilean night using the magellan clay telescope . with the addition of these two stars , the sample microlensed bulge main sequence turnoff region stars with high resolution , high quality spectra and published",
    "detailed abundance analysis becomes six stars ; we refer to them collectively as the six microlensed dwarfs .",
    "the ability to obtain high resolution , high quality spectra of galactic bulge stars and to carry out a detailed abundance analysis offers an unbiased way to determine the metallicity distribution of stars in the galactic bulge , as well as their detailed chemical inventory .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to carry out detailed abundance analyses for the two additional microlensed bulge dwarfs (  [ section_abunds ] ) .",
    "then in  [ section_discussion ] we use the six microlensed dwarf sample to study the bulge metallicity distribution function as well as their abundance ratios , and to compare them to the results obtained by a number of surveys of giants in the galactic bulge .",
    "moa2008blg310s  and moa2008blg311s  were observed on two consecutive nights in july 2008 using the mike spectrograph @xcite on the 6.5  m magellan clay telescope at the las campanas observatory by i.  thompson and g.  burley .",
    "details of the exposures are given in table  [ table_stars ] .",
    "spectroscopic exposures for moa2008blg311s  began at ut 22:58 just after sunset at airmass 1.93 ( 4.1 hours east of the meridian , so the initially large airmass decreased quickly ) when it was magnified by a factor of 190 ; the star was just past its maximum brightness of @xmath14  mag and fading at that time .",
    "the photometry of this microlensing event is consistent with a point source being magnified by a perfect point lens .",
    "spectroscopic exposures of moa2008blg310s  began with mike the following night at ut 22:51 at airmass 1.87 at the same hour angle as for moa2008blg311s .",
    "moa2008blg310s  was brighter than moa2008blg311s  at the time of observation by @xmath70.8  mag .",
    "a narrower slit 0.5  arcsec wide was used to isolate moa2008blg310s  from a close companion roughly 2  mag fainter . fortunately the seeing that night was very good ( 0.6  arcsec ) after the first half hour ( i.e. once the airmass became reasonable ) , and the companion rotated further away from the slit with time . thus , even with the narrower slit and consequently higher spectral resolution , a high signal - to - noise ratio per spectral resolution element was achieved for the spectrum of this star .",
    "the light curve of moa2008blg310s  shows pronounced finite - source effects , with the lens exiting the limb of the source about 20 minutes before the start of spectroscopic observations .",
    "in addition , the light curve shows much smaller deviations from standard point - lens microlensing due to a companion to the lens ( j.  janczak et al .",
    "2009 , in prep ) .",
    "johnson et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) has explored the impact of differential amplification across the surface of a dwarf near the main sequence turnoff as it affects an abundance analysis ; she finds it to be negligible compared to the uncertainties in the abundances .",
    "the microlensed bulge dwarfs suffer from substantial reddening whose exact value is unknown .",
    "we therefore rely purely on their spectra to determine their stellar parameters .",
    "the classical technique of excitation equilibrium for the set of the many fe  i lines measured is used to find @xmath0",
    ". then the microturbulent velocity @xmath15 is set by requiring the deduced fe abundance to be independent of the equivalent width @xmath16  for the same set of lines .",
    "the surface gravity is set by requiring ionization equilibrium between neutral and singly ionized fe ; the ionization equilibrium for ti in both of the stars is then extremely good . if the deduced [ fe / h ] is substantially different from that assumed to construct the model atmosphere , the process is repeated with the [ fe / h ] determined from the initial pass used for the model atmospheres . throughout this process , we choose to ignore lines with @xmath16  exceeding 130  m  due to the difficulty of properly including their damping wings in the @xmath16  measurements .",
    "features bluer than 5200  were ignored unless the species had very few other detected lines as the signal - to - noise ratio decreases rapidly at bluer wavelengths due to the high reddening along the line of sight to the galactic bulge .",
    "because the spectra are not perfect , and being concerned about the convergence of this scheme onto the correct set of stellar parameters , we decided to develop a technique for determining [ fe / h ] , at least approximately , that might bypass some of these issues and indicate the magnitude of some of the uncertainties in a more direct fashion .",
    "following in the spirit of the line ratio method developed by @xcite and used by @xcite , we looked for something easy to measure based purely on aspects of the spectrum that have a strong dependence on metallicity , but little dependence on any other stellar parameter .",
    "as a guide we constructed plots based on detailed abundance analyses of the behavior of weak lines of species with many detected absorption lines as a function of the set of adopted stellar parameters @xmath0 , log(@xmath17 ) , [ fe / h ] of the model atmosphere , and @xmath15 that would enable us to isolate metallicity from them . figure  [ figure_fe1_weakline ] illustrates the best case we found for stars in the region of the main sequence turnoff , namely [ fe / h ] derived from fe  i absorption lines with high excitation ( @xmath18  ev ) , which show low sensitivity to changes in @xmath0  of @xmath6250  k or of log(@xmath17 )  of @xmath60.5  dex within the regime of interest .",
    "although not shown on the figure , we note that increasing [ fe / h ] of the model atmosphere by 0.5  dex increases the deduced [ fe / h ] by only 0.05  dex . using high excitation fe  i lines , the final derived [ fe / h ] from a detailed abundance analysis",
    "is bound to be close to the true value even if the adopted stellar parameters are slightly off .",
    "the weak dependence of the behavior of such lines on @xmath0  is a result of the competition between ionizing fe  i when @xmath0  is increased versus increasing the population in the high excitation state from which the absorption features arise .",
    "fe  ii lines with @xmath19  ev show a similar behavior with @xmath0 , but have much more sensitivity to changes in log(@xmath17 )  than do fe  i lines .",
    "the resulting stellar parameters for moa2008blg310s  and moa2008blg311sare listed in table  [ table_params ] , which also gives the slopes between deduced [ fe / h ] abundances and the excitation potential , @xmath16 , and @xmath20 of the set of fe  i lines with @xmath16  @xmath21  m . we see that extremely good results ( i.e. almost flat relations with slopes very close to 0 ) were obtained for the first two ( primarily sensitive to @xmath0  and to @xmath15 respectively ) .",
    "the slope with wavelength for moa2008blg310s  is somewhat larger than ideal but the correlation coefficient is low ( @xmath22 ) , and the total change over the span of 2600    covered is only 0.07  dex .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath0  is related to the first slope , which decreases by @xmath70.05  dev / ev when @xmath0  is increased by 250  k in this regime . assuming a reasonable sample of low excitation fe  i lines ,",
    "so that the range of the measured lines covers @xmath74  ev , we set the uncertainty in @xmath0  to 100  k. the uncertainty in log(@xmath17 )  then follows by considering the error resulting in ionization equilibrium of fe  i should @xmath0  be off by 100  k , which has to be compensated for by changing log(@xmath17 ) .",
    "there is an additional smaller uncertainty in log(@xmath17)arising from the uncertainty in the value of [ fe / h](fe  i )  [ fe / h](fe  ii ) itself .",
    "we find an uncertainty in log(@xmath17 )  of 0.2  dex in log(@xmath17 )  is appropriate .",
    "we note that a fit to the h@xmath23 profile in moa2008blg310s , the star with the higher snr spectrum , indicates @xmath0  @xmath24  k , 120  k less than that derived from the fe  i line analysis .",
    "we also compare our derived values of @xmath0  with those that would be inferred from the photometry of the two microlensed bulge dwarfs .",
    "light curves were obtained in two colors , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , by the @xmath13fun collaboration for moa2008blg310sand for moa2008blg311s  during the microlensing event as part of an effort to detect planets . the color of red clump stars  mag and @xmath27  mag . ] in the field around each of the microlensed stars is easily determined .",
    "the comparison of instrumental @xmath28 and @xmath26 of the red clump and the microlensed star then yield @xmath29 and @xmath30 of the star , under the assumption that it suffers the same extinction as the clump .",
    "if the microlensed star is further assumed to lie at the same distance as the clump , then the star s absolute magnitude @xmath31 can be calculated .",
    "this yields @xmath32  mag for moa2008blg310s  and @xmath33  mag for moa2008blg311s , with @xmath34  mag for moa2008blg310s  and 18.37  mag for moa2006blg099s311 ; @xmath26 is in the cousins system .",
    "the sun has @xmath35   mag @xcite , which would suggest that @xmath0  for these two microlensed stars is quite close to that of the sun .",
    "given the uncertainties in the photometry and the probability of small spatial variations in the reddening across the field , this is in good agreement with the @xmath0  derived directly from the spectra of moa2008blg310sand of moa2008blg311s  of table  [ table_params ] .",
    "these independent determinations of @xmath0 , together with their uncertainties , are summarized in table  [ table_teff ] .",
    "we consider whether the derived parameters are consistent with the star being in the galactic bulge by comparing log(@xmath17)derived from the spectra with that derived from the photometry .",
    "@xmath30 is converted into a total luminosity assuming a distance to the galactic center of 8  kpc . then using the derived @xmath0 , and assuming a mass of 1@xmath36 , we predict log(@xmath17)(phot ) . the agreement between log(@xmath17)(phot ) and log(@xmath17)(spec )",
    "is reasonable , with differences of 0.1  dex moa2008blg310s , and 0.3  dex for moa2008blg311s .",
    "the ages of the microlensed bulge dwarfs are determined by comparing @xmath31 as a function of @xmath0  from the relevant [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath23/fe ] isochrones of the grid of the dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_age ] .",
    "the results for moa2008blg310sand moa2008blg311s  are given in the last column of table  [ table_stars ] ; they are consistent to within the errors with that of the galactic bulge population inferred from hst imaging , @xmath710  gyr , by @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "once the stellar parameters were determined , the abundance analysis was carried out in a manner identical to that for ogle2007blg349s  as described in @xcite ; in particular it was a differential analysis with respect to the sun . in preparing",
    "the line list only features redder than 5200  were used , unless there were none that red for a particular species , due to increased crowding toward the blue and to the high reddening .",
    "lines with @xmath16  @xmath37  m  were rejected unless the species did not have at least a few suitably weak lines .",
    "the exceptions are the 5680    na doublet and the k  i resonance line at 7700    in both stars .",
    "also one mg  i , one si  i line , and the only two cu  i lines detected in moa2008blg310s , each of which had @xmath16  @xmath38  m , were retained .",
    "the equivalent widths are given in table  [ table_eqw ] ; their major uncertainty results from the definition of the continuum level .",
    "we used a current version of the lte spectral synthesis program moog @xcite .",
    "we employ the grid of stellar atmospheres from @xcite with [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and + 0.5  dex having solar abundance ratios without convective overshoot @xcite and with the most recent opacity distribution functions .",
    "non - lte corrections were not included , as this is a differential analysis with respect to sun , and the stellar parameters of both of these stars are fairly close to those of the sun .",
    "hyperfine structure corrections were used as appropriate ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the deduced abundances for moa2008blg310s  and for moa2008blg311s   are given in tables  [ table_abunds_moa310 ] and [ table_abunds_moa311 ] respectively , with derived absolute abundances ( second column ) , the abundances relative to the sun ( fifth column ) , and the abundance ratios [ x / fe ] ( seventh column ) .",

    "while the absolute abundance for a given species listed in tables  [ table_abunds_moa310 ] and [ table_abunds_moa311 ] will be affected by any systematic error in the @xmath41 values of the lines we use here , relative abundances [ x / fe ] will not since we have carried out a differential analysis with respect to the sun . an uncertainty for [ x / fe ] for each species , @xmath42 ,",

    "( tables  3 and 4 of @xcite give the values of these four individual terms for each species . ) the fifth term , the contribution for errors in @xmath16 , is set to 0.05  dex if only one or two lines were measured ; for a larger number of detected lines we adopt @xmath44 for this term .",
    "this is added in quadrature to the other four terms to determine our final uncertainty estimate given in the final column of table  [ table_abunds_moa310 ] and of table  [ table_abunds_moa311 ] .",
    "we note that the total uncertainty in [ fe / h ] so derived is 0.09  dex when the large set of fe  i lines is used .    the key result of the abundance analysis is the high fe - metallicity found for the two microlensed galactic bulge stars in the region of the main sequence turnoff , [ fe / h ] @xmath45  dex for moa2008blg310s  and + 0.26  dex for moa2008blg311s .",
    "the abundance ratios are also of great interest . figures  [ figure_abund_ratios1 ] , [ figure_abund_ratios2 ] , and [ figure_abund_ratios3 ] show selected abundance ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] for the six microlensed bulge dwarfs .",
    "these are compared with abundance ratios from surveys of galactic bulge giants by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "the location of baade s window is marked .",
    "this is the field closest to the center of the milky way with reddening low enough that its bulge giants can be studied in detail in the optical with the current generation of large telescopes , and has thus been the subject of many recent surveys at the vlt ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* among others ) .",
    "the circle marks the region with projected galactocentric distance equal to that of baade s window .",
    "it is important to note that five of the six microlensed bulge dwarfs are slightly outside that circle ; only one is slightly within it .",
    "this means that the population we are sampling via microlensing should be essentially identical to the population sampled by studies of the giants in baade s window .",
    "@xcite detected a small radial gradient in the mean metallicity with galactocentric distance of 0.6  dex / kpc ( 0.08  dex / deg on the sky at the distance of the galactic center ) .",
    "the gradient was established between baade s window and bulge fields with larger projected @xmath48 .",
    "this would suggest that the mean fe - metallicity of the sample of microlensed bulge dwarfs should be @xmath70.05  dex lower than that of baade s window .",
    "@xcite recently redetermined the fe - metallicity distribution function in baade s window using a sample of 204 luminous k giants with @xmath49  mag spanning a wide range in @xmath50 color ( @xmath51  mag ) so as to cover the full metallicity range within the stellar population of the galactic bulge .",
    "there is also a sample of @xmath7200 red clump giants in the baade s window discussed in @xcite .",
    "red clump stars are biased against low metallicities , where rr  lyrae and blue horizontal branch stars would be expected instead , but should not be biased at the [ fe / h ] values relevant here , [ fe / h ] @xmath52  dex . @xcite",
    "combine the two datasets for a total sample of @xmath7400 giants in this field .",
    "figure  [ figure_feh_hist ] compares the fe - metallicity distribution function recently determined by @xcite in baade s window with that of the six microlensed bulge dwarfs .",
    "the distributions are clearly different .",
    "the microlensed bulge dwarfs reveal a significantly higher mean fe - metallicity than do the giants studied by @xcite , who find a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath53  dex for the 204 k giants and @xmath54  dex for the red clump stars from @xcite .",
    "this is considerably lower than that of the six microlensed bulge dwarfs .",
    "furthermore , k and m giants closer to the galactic center than baade s window at ( @xmath55 have been probed through high resolution infrared spectroscopy by @xcite , who also find a low mean fe - metallicity , @xmath56  dex , and no sign of a radial gradient in metallicity for @xmath48 inward from baade s window ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "to evaluate the statistical significance of this difference in fe - metallicity , we drew six stars at random from the sample of @xcite , eliminating stars in the globular cluster ngc  6822 , which is in baade s window , and also those with highly uncertain [ fe / h ] as indicated by the quality codes in their table .",
    "we took the average [ fe / h ] , which we call the six star mean .",
    "note that the microlensed bulge star with by far the lowest [ fe / h ] is actually a subgiant ; it is the only subgiant among the six and is quite discrepant in [ fe / h ] from the other five microlensed bulge dwarfs .",
    "the results for 40,000 such trials are given in table  [ table_prob ] as the percentage of trials where the mean [ fe / h ] for six stars drawn from the bulge giant sample equaled or exceeded that of the set of six microlensed bulge dwarfs .",
    "if the [ fe / h ] values of the large sample of bulge giants from @xcite are correct , and those of the six microlensed dwarfs are correct as well , then the probability that the two metallicity distribution functions are identical is very small , @xmath57 , ignoring any radial gradient , which would further reduce the tabulated probabilities for metallicity increasing as galactocentric radius decreases .",
    "a k - s test also indicates a very low probability that the two metallicity distributions are the same , 1.9% .",
    "however , if there are systematic errors in the metallicity scale of either ( or of both ) , and they act in the right direction , the probability of this happening by chance increases .",
    "therefore table  [ table_prob ] also contains the probability in the case of systematic offsets of the correct sign ranging from 0.05 to 0.20  dex in size . a systematic difference in fe - metallicity scale between the two samples of 0.20  dex such that either the bulge giant metallicities are underestimated or those of the microlensed dwarfs are overestimated is required before the probability reaches 20% .",
    "@xcite quotes a `` conservative '' uncertainty in [ fe / h ] of an individual giant as @xmath58  dex , including possible systematic errors .",
    "a substantial systematic error in [ fe / h ] is required to produce consistency between the microlensed bulge stars and the k ( and m ) giant samples .",
    "if only @xmath0is changed and one looks at the fe - metallicity derived from fe  i lines ( which is only logical , since there are far fewer fe  ii lines detectable ) , a 0.2  dex change corresponds to a 400  k systematic error for the microlensed stars near the main sequence turnoff , as was shown in figure  [ figure_fe1_weakline ] , and to at least a 500  k systematic error if the problem lies in the cool giants , as at such low temperatures , iron is almost entirely neutral .",
    "this level of systematic error is larger than the uncertainty in the absolute fe - metallicity of the microlensed dwarfs , as their spectra can be compared directly to the solar spectrum .",
    "@xcite includes a comparison of [ fe / h ] for the previously published four microlensed bulge dwarfs derived independently , with different codes , different grids of model atmospheres , and different schemes for determining the stellar parameters , by t.  bensby , j.  cohen , and j.  a.  johnson ; the agreement among the analyses by the three independent groups is quite good , @xmath59  dex . on the other hand , the analysis of the cool giants and the determination of their stellar parameters is much more difficult .",
    "however , the required error in @xmath0  for the bulge giants is even larger , and seems very unlikely .",
    "furthermore many independent groups have surveyed giants in the galactic bulge , with similar results as to the mean fe - metallicity , so there is no reason to assign the required systematic error to them .",
    "there are a number of consistency checks that have been or could be carried out to test the validity of the absolute fe abundances between the bulge giants and the microlensed dwarfs .",
    "the scale of the fe transition probabilities is not relevant for the dwarfs , as a differential solar analysis was used .",
    "but it is for the giants ; @xcite used a differential analysis with respect to the well studied giant arcturus , while @xcite use the spectrum of the metal - rich giant @xmath13  leo to derive pseudo-@xmath41 values appropriate for their method of measuring @xmath16  and their grid of model atmospheres , while their absolute scale for [ fe / h ] is set by taking [ fe / h ] for this star as + 0.30  dex .",
    "checks of the determination of the continuum level in the giant spectra , where this is quite difficult , could be carried out with very high quality spectra of a few bulge giants .",
    "differences between the model atmosphere grids are probably not the cause as several independent groups have participated both for the dwarfs and for the giants . however , systematic problems affecting all the chosen model atmosphere grids as @xmath0decreases such as overionization of fe could be contributing .",
    "arguments that studies of members of a single open or globular cluster at a wide range of luminosities show no such effect ( see e.g. santos et al 2009 vs. boesgaard , jensen & deliyannis 2009 ) re often not relevant to the present case when examined in detail . for example , @xcite studied giants and dwarfs in the open cluster ic  1651 with [ fe / h ] + 0.10  dex . however , their coolest and most luminous giant is several hundred k hotter in @xmath0  and 0.4  dex higher in log(@xmath17 ) than the hottest and least luminous of the bulge giants in the sample of @xcite .",
    "stars near the rgb tip are very rare , and are unlikely to be found in any open cluster , while no globular cluster with [ fe / h ] @xmath60  dex is known in the galaxy .",
    "furthermore the best abundances for the most metal - rich clusters come from dropping in luminosity to the rhb , where @xmath0  is considerably higher , and avoiding the rgb tip giants completely ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is thus a clear discrepancy between the metallicity distribution function in the galactic bulge as sampled by microlensed main sequence turnoff region stars and by luminous k and m giants . while still more microlensed dwarfs with detailed abundance analyses are highly desired to improve the statistics , we assume that this difference is real and is not the result of systematic errors producing suitable offsets in [ fe / h ] derived from the abundance analyses .    in our earlier paper @xcite we offered the suggestion that the highest metallicity giants have such high mass loss rates that they do not get to the rgb tip before losing their entire envelope .",
    "possible evidence against this hypothesis is presented by @xcite on the basis of the luminosity function along the rgb ; @xcite comment that the metallicity distribution of the bulge giants and of main sequence stars inferred from acs / hst phometry are consistent with each other .",
    "an additional possibility is that we are sampling a `` young '' and metal - rich stellar population such as that found within the inner 40  pc , where rather surprisingly massive young clusters exist @xcite , presumably fed , at least in part , by mass loss from bulge giants .",
    "this runs into the problem that the corresponding high luminosity stars from such a population are not present in baade s window , as reinforced by the very recent acs / hst study of the galactic bulge by @xcite .",
    "a similar argument applies for any proposed special component of the central region of our galaxy such as an extension of the disk .",
    "@xcite determined the metallicity gradient for the galactic disk from analysis of a large sample of cepheid variables outside 4  kpc from the center to be @xmath61  dex kpc@xmath43 .",
    "it is interesting to note that their deduced [ fe / h ] reached + 0.3  dex at @xmath62  kpc , and if their linear fit is extrapolated inward , would reach + 0.5  dex at @xmath63  kpc . a similarly metal - rich population of solar neighborhood disk stars whose highly eccentric orbits have pericentric distances as small as 3  kpc was identified by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these super metal - rich old dwarfs have [ fe / h ] reaching up to + 0.4  dex and mean distance from the galactic plane of only 220  pc . but a rather puffed up disk would be required to contribute significantly at baade s window , which is at @xmath64 ( 560  pc ) . certainly over a very large range in @xmath48",
    "the vertical scale height of the thin disk is smaller than that .",
    "another possibility is that the disk and/or halo contamination in the giant samples in baade s window is larger than that calculated from galactic models by @xcite and others .",
    "little is known of the detailed structure of the disk and bulge in the region of the galactic center .",
    "although disk and halo contamination of the giant samples are believed to be small based on calculations using models of the stellar population of the galaxy ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the uncertainty in such corrections might be large .",
    "the extensive proper motion studies in bulge fields ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) give good determinations of the foreground disk contamination , but can not easily address the possible presence of the disk within the bulge itself provided it makes a minor contribution to the total stellar population in the bulge .",
    "disk contamination in the microlensed sample , which is a sample of background sources , must be smaller than that of the in situ giant samples , which probe the long line of sight to the center ; the probability of microlensing for a foreground disk star is much smaller than for a star in the bulge itself , hence very biased strongly against disk stars .",
    "we present detailed abundance analyses based on high dispersion and high signal - to - noise ratio mike spectra taken with the 6.5  m magellan clay telescope of two highly microlensed galactic bulge stars in the region of the main sequence turnoff .",
    "our stellar parameters were derived ignoring the available photometry out of concern for the high and uncertain reddening toward the bulge , and rely only on the spectra themselves .",
    "they are based on the classical criteria of fe excitation equilibrium , and the ionization equilibrium of fe and of ti , and are consistent to within the adopted errors with that inferred from the h@xmath23 profile for the star with the higher quality spectrum , moa2008blg310s .",
    "we deduce @xmath0  near 5650  k for both of these stars .",
    "moa2008blg310s  and moa2008blg311s  appear to be at the distance of the bulge with age @xmath79  gyr .",
    "we suggest that the use of high excitation ( @xmath18  ev ) fe  i lines is the measure of metallicity most independent of the exact choice of values for stellar parameters for such stars among the various possibilities we explored .",
    "we note that the available @xmath65 photometry for the two stars supports our choice of @xmath0  for each to within the photometric errors and the uncertainty of the reddening determination , which is based on red clump stars in the bulge in the field around each of the microlensed dwarfs .",
    "we carry out a detailed classical abundance analysis using 1d stellar model atmospheres and ignoring non - lte .",
    "since this is done differentially to the sun and the two stars both have @xmath0  within 160  k of that of the sun and log(@xmath17 )  within 0.3  dex of the sun , these choices seem appropriate .",
    "we find that moa2008blg310s  has [ fe / h ] = + 0.41@xmath60.09  dex and moa2008blg311s  has + 0.26@xmath60.09  dex .",
    "the abundance ratios for the @xmath720 elements for which features could be detected in the spectra of each of the two stars follow the trends with [ fe / h ] found among samples of galactic bulge giants .    combining these two bulge stars with the results from previous abundance analysis of four other galactic bulge dwarfs ,",
    "all highly magnified by microlensing , gives a mean [ fe / h ] of + 0.29  dex for the six microlensed dwarfs , which rises to + 0.41 when the lowest metallicity dwarf , which is actually a subgiant with [ fe / h ] very discrepant from the other five stars , is removed . on the other hand , the many large surveys of the metallicity distribution function in the galactic bulge carried out at the vlt @xcite and at keck ( *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) from samples of cool , luminous bulge giants give mean [ fe / h ] @xmath8  dex .",
    "this implies that there is an inconsistency between the fe - metallicity distribution of the microlensed bulge dwarfs and that derived by the bulge giants .",
    "this difference is highly statistically significant assuming that both the abundance analyses of the giant samples and of the six microlensed dwarfs have been carried out correctly .",
    "we provide statistical arguments suggesting that to produce consistency a substantial systematic error in the absolute metallicity of fe in one or both of the two cases , bulge dwarfs vs bulge giants , is necessary .",
    "the required offset which must act to either underestimate the metallicities for the giants or overestimate those of the microlensed dwarfs , or both of these , is 0.2  dex in [ fe / h ] , ignoring a radial gradient , which would only increase this value .",
    "were a systematic offset of this size present , the probability of the observed metallicity distribution functions for these two groups of bulge stars in very different evolutionary phases to be identical would rise to 15% .",
    "since the microlensed main sequence region stars are usually analyzed differentially with respect to the sun , to which they are fairly close in stellar parameters , the resulting systematic errors should be small .",
    "furthermore there are now multiple independent analyses for several of the microlensed dwarfs ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there are several major independent surveys of bulge giants , suggesting that it is unlikely that either the dwarfs or the giants or both have major systematic errors in their [ fe / h ] determinations .",
    "the contamination by foreground disk stars is predicted to be small for the giant samples ; samples of bulge dwarfs selected through microlensing should contain a considerably smaller fraction of foreground disk stars .",
    "a number of mechanisms for producing this difference are discussed , but none seems compelling .",
    "we clearly need a still larger sample of microlensed bulge dwarfs to refine the systematic offset required to achieve statistically identical fe - metallicity distributions and to eliminate completely the possibility that a systematic error of the required size may have occurred in one or both of the fe - metallicities between the bulge giants and the bulge microlensed dwarfs before indulging in further speculations of the cause of this discrepancy .",
    "the rising interest in time - domain phenomena has led to increased attention on how to handle these phenomena efficiently at large telescopes , increasing sensitivity for the handling of targets of opportunity . in the past three years",
    ", high dispersion spectra for six highly microlensed bulge dwarfs have been obtained at the las campanas or the keck observatory . with high hopes that the same will hold for the next three years , we eagerly await future larger samples of microlensed bulge turnoff region stars .    j.g.c . and w.h .",
