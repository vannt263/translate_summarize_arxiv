    " is a strong short - range repulsion , which induces strong short - range correlations in the quantum many - body state .",
    "the repulsive core prevents the particles to approach each other closer than the radius of this core such that the two - body density matrix is strongly depleted for particle distances smaller than the core radius .",

    "these correlations induce high - momentum components into the relative wave function that can not be treated within a low - momentum model space .",
    "the correlation operator @xmath5 generates the short - range correlations by a unitary transformation in the relative coordinate of each pair of particles .",
    "it shifts the particles out of the repulsive core of the two - body interaction .",
    "the correlation operator is then used to define correlated observables , most notably the correlated hamiltonian .",
    "the unitary transformation yields a tamed effective two - body interaction , which consists of a purely attractive local part and a weak momentum dependence .",
    "in addition three - body and higher order terms are generated .",
    "for dilute systems , i.e. , if the range of the correlations is small compared to the average distance between the particles , it is sufficient to include the terms up to two - body order . in high - density systems the higher order terms can be included explicitly or simulated by a density - dependent correlation function .    in order to study the applicability of the method in many - body systems , where short - range correlations play a dominant role",
    ", we investigated the ground state properties of homogeneous @xmath122he liquids and small droplets .",
    "the correlation function is fixed by energy minimization in the two - body problem with a constant uncorrelated wave function .",
    "alternatively the correlation function can be determined by mapping an uncorrelated wave function onto the exact energy @xmath108 two - body wave function .",
    "we use this correlation function to calculate the energy of the homogeneous @xmath122he liquid as function of density .",
    "the uncorrelated many - body state is a direct product of constant one - body states , thus the influence of the interaction on the state has to be described by the correlation operator alone . already in two - body approximation",
    "the strong short - range repulsion of the lennard - jones potential is tamed completely and we obtain a bound system .",
    "however , the two - body approximation does not generate saturation , i.e. , the energy per particle decreases proportional to density . to simulate the effect of many - body correlations",
    "we employ a density - dependent correlation function .",
    "the one parameter introduced by the density dependent scaling of the correlation function is fixed by adjusting the correlated energy for one value of the density to the result of a gfmc calculation .",
    "the resulting equation of state shows a minimum and is in very good agreement with the predictions of the gfmc calculation over the whole density range .    in a second step",
    "we use the density - independent as well as the density - dependent correlation function to perform an _ ab initio _ calculation of the ground state structure of small @xmath122he droplets in a simple variational framework .",
    "it turns out that the two - body approximation with the density - independent correlation function gives a good description for small droplets with particle numbers @xmath234 . for larger droplets an overbinding compared to a quasi exact variational monte carlo calculation appears .",
    "due to the higher density in these droplets many - body correlations become relevant .",
    "if we use the density - dependent correlation function with one parameter adjusted in the homogeneous liquid then the energies and rms - radii are in very good agreement with the exact calculation for all particle numbers under consideration .",
    "we conclude that the unitary correlation operator method is a powerful and universal tool to handle short - range correlations in the many - body system . for sufficiently low densities one can use the two - body approximation to construct the correlated hamiltonian as well as other correlated observables in closed form .",
    "the resulting effective two - body interaction can be used for an ab initio description of the many - body system based on a low - momentum model space .",
    "a gross measure for the validity of the two - body approximation is the smallness parameter @xmath75 , which should be below a phenomenological limit of @xmath169 .    for higher densities one can utilize density - dependent correlation functions to describe many - body correlations effectively within the two - body approximation .",
    "the additional parameter in the density - dependence can be fixed by one measured data point or by comparison with an exact calculation .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting density - dependent correlator can then be used for a broad range of applications , e.g. , _ ab initio _ calculations of correlated observables like energies , densities or momentum distributions of different systems without further adjustments .",
    "the great advantage of the unitary correlation operator method with density - dependent correlation functions is that besides its transparent physics it requires only minimal computational power compared to the huge computational resources needed for monte - carlo - type calculations .",
    "a set of _ mathematica _ notebooks that illustrate the application of the unitary correlation operator method to @xmath0he liquids can be found at the url : ` http://theory.gsi.de/~rroth/math/ ` ."
