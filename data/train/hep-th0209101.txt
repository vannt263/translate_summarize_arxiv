    "although standard model of particle physics has been established as the uncontested theory of all interactions down to distances of @xmath0 m , there are good reasons to believe that there is a new physics arising soon at the experimental level @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", string theory provides an excelent background to solve long standing problems of theoretical high energy physics .",
    "it is by now a widespread idea that m - theory @xcite is a reasonable description of our universe . in the field theory limit",
    ", it is described by a solution of the ( eventually 11-dimensional ) einstein equations with a cosmological constant by means of a four dimensional membrane . in this picture",
    "only gravity survives in the extra dimensions , while the remaining matter and gauge interactions are typically four dimensional .    in this picture",
    ", there is a possibility that gravitational fields , while propagating out of the brane speed up , reaching farther distances in smaller time as compared to light propagating inside the brane , a scenario that for a resident of the brane ( as ourselves ) implies shortcuts @xcite@xcite .",
    "this possibility implies that we can have alternatives to the inflationary scenario in order to explain the homogeneity problem in cosmology .",
    "recently , this scenario has been proposed as an actually realizable possibility @xcite@xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that in some scenarios shortcuts are very difficult to be detected today because of the extremely short delay of the photon as compared to the graviton coming from the same source . however , in cases where before nucleosynthesis delays are large enough to imply thermalization of the whole universe , a possible solution to the homogeneity problem @xcite , alternative @xcite to inflation @xcite may exist based on these shortcuts . in the case of domain walls shortcuts are common and a possibility of solving the homogeneity problem may be under way , though further work is certainly necessary .",
    "recently it has been proved @xcite that brane universes can provide a means for finding relics of the higher dimensions in the cosmic microwave background as well .",
    "thus it is worthwhile further pursuing brane models as useful tools to understand the physics of strings and m - theory @xcite , which proves them as very important instances to try a better insight of the universe and its properties .    at last",
    ", we should stress that this is a toy model where the universe is replaced by a domain wall .",
    "the more realistic case deserves attention as well ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a scenario described by the gravitational action in a d - dimensional bulk with a scalar field , a bulk dilaton , a domain wall potential and a gibbons - hawking term @xcite , [ action ] s = _ bulk d^d x ( 1 2 r - 1 2 ( ) ^2 -v ( ) ) - _ dw d^d-1 x ( [ k ] + v ( ) ) , where @xmath1 is the bulk dilaton , @xmath2 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are bulk and domain wall potentials respectively , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the bulk and domain wall metrics .",
    "the potentials are here considered to be of the liouville type : @xmath7    we consider the bulk metric as being static and invariant under rotation , being given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the line element on a @xmath10 dimensional space of constant curvature depending on a parameter @xmath11 .",
    "such a metric is supposed to have a mirror symmetry @xmath12 with respect to the domain wall . such a symmetry will be used in order to impose the israel conditions @xcite .",
    "in fact , the variation of the total action ( [ action ] ) including the gibbons - hawking term leads directly to the israel conditions which in view of the @xmath12 symmetry become @xmath13 the extrinsic curvature can be computed as @xmath14 where the unit normal , which points into @xmath15 , is @xmath16 here a dot means derivative with respect to the bulk time @xmath17 .    the @xmath18 component of ( [ israel ] ) can be written as @xmath19 while the @xmath20 component is @xmath21 here a prime denotes derivative with respect to the radial extra coordinate @xmath22 .",
    "the equation of motion for the dilaton obtained from the action ( [ action ] ) , together with ( [ 00 ] ) , can be simultaneously solved with the ansatz ( [ metric ] ) , leading to @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are arbitrary integration constants .",
    "the motion of the domain wall is governed by the @xmath18 component of the israel conditions ( [ ij ] ) .",
    "that equation can be written in terms of the brane proper time @xmath26 as @xmath27    the induced metric on the domain wall is friedmann - robertson - walker and ( [ dwmotion ] ) describes the evolution of the scale factor @xmath28 .",
    "this equation is the same as that one for a particle of unit mass and zero energy rolling in a potential @xmath29 given by @xmath30 notice that the solution only exists when @xmath31 .    from the induced domain wall metric",
    "we find the relations between the time parameter on the brane ( @xmath26 ) and in the bulk ( @xmath17 ) as given by dt = u d , so that @xmath32 where @xmath33 can be obtained from ( [ dwmotion ] ) . equation ( [ eq3 ] ) describes the motion of a domain wall in the static background as seen by an observer in the bulk .",
    "consider two points on the brane .",
    "in general , there are more than one null geodesic connecting them in the d - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the trajectories of photons must be on the brane and those of gravitons may be outside .",
    "we consider the shortest path for both photons and gravitons .",
    "for the latter , the geodesic equation is the same as the one considered in @xcite , since the bulk metric is static : @xmath34 again a dot means derivative with respect to the bulk time @xmath17 .",
    "the solutions of ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ geo ] ) in terms of the bulk proper time @xmath17 were obtained by means of a * maple * program .",
    "now we discuss the possibility of shortcuts in the cases of the various solutions describing different universes defined by the domain wall solution .",
    "we define the type i brane solutions as those for which @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , the potentials become cosmological constants .",
    "the solution also has a constant dilaton @xmath36 .",
    "a simple rescaling in the metric leads us to @xmath37 with @xmath38 which corresponds to a topological black hole solution in d dimensions with a cosmological constant .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if the domain wall has positive energy density ( @xmath39 ) , the relevant part of the bulk spacetime is @xmath40 , which is the region containing the singularity . if it has negative energy density ( @xmath41 ) , the relevant part is @xmath42 , which is non - singular unless the wall reaches @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    the potential @xmath29 ruling the evolution of the scale factor is @xmath49 where the effective cosmological constant on the domain wall is given by @xmath50 \\ , .\\ ] ]    we shall analyze each of the four cases presented in @xcite . as we have previously stated , the equation of motion ( [ dwmotion ] ) has a solution only when @xmath31 .",
    "this is automatic only if @xmath51 , i.e. if @xmath22 is a time coordinate ; therefore , we look for solutions with @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , both conditions , @xmath53 can coexist in some cases as we will see in what follows . in order to ilustrate the following examples we have chosen @xmath54 dimensions .      from the graph of @xmath57 ( see fig.[t1-u ] ) we can choose the initial condition for the domain wall assuming that ( [ u1 ] ) describes a ds - schwarzschild bulk with event and cosmological horizons when @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "we thus choose the initial condition for the domain wall inside this region and where @xmath22 is a space coordinate . from fig.[t1-u",
    "] let us notice that there are two small regions , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where ( [ condition1 ] ) holds .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[t1-braneb ] .",
    "we see that for region i the geodesics follow the domain wall for a while and then decouple falling into the event horizon . for region",
    "ii all the geodesics and the domain wall converge to the cosmological horizon @xmath61 independently of the value of @xmath62 .",
    "this case describes an ads - schwarzschild bulk .",
    "the condition ( [ condition1 ] ) is fullfilled inside a very small range as we can see in fig.[t1-u3](a ) .",
    "however , all the geodesics fall into the event horizon after following some path on the brane ( see fig.[t1-u3](b ) ) .      from fig.[t1-u2](a ) we choose the initial condition for the domain wall equation of motion inside the region where ( [ condition1 ] ) holds . as we can see from fig.[t1-u2](b ) , the domain wall and the geodesic converge to the cosmological horizon @xmath61 .",
    "however , after some threshold initial velocity the geodesics diverge to the timelike naked singularity .      in this case",
    "( [ dwmotion ] ) can only have solution when @xmath65 .",
    "this is a topological black hole in an asymtotically ads space . from fig.[t1-u4 ] we see that there is no solution fulfilling ( [ condition1 ] ) between event and cosmological horizons .",
    "@xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    the type ii solutions have @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the metric is given by @xmath71 and the scale factor is @xmath72 where @xmath73    the potential is given by the expression @xmath74 where @xmath75    there are twelve cases from which we choose those ones where @xmath22 is a spatial coordinate .",
    "when @xmath76 , @xmath22 is a spatial coordinate if @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath78 , @xmath22 is spatial if @xmath64",
    ".    we should also rewrite ( [ condition1 ] ) as @xmath79      in this case @xmath81 is always positive , whereas @xmath82 is negative for small @xmath22 . from fig.[t2-br1 ] we see that some microscopic shortcuts appear in the very beginning of the solution and after crossing the domain wall they escape to infinity .",
    "this case describes a black @xmath85 brane solution in ads space . here there is a very small region where ( [ condition2 ] ) holds after the event horizon as we can see from fig.[t2-br2 ] .",
    "we show the entire domain wall solution and we see that geodesics follow it and then decouple to fall into the event horizon at later times .",
    "this case is also a black brane in ads space .",
    "the region where ( [ condition2 ] ) is respected is shown in fig.[t2-br3 ] . as in the previous case",
    "all the geodesics follow the domain wall and at later times fall into the event horizon .      as @xmath82 is always positive for all @xmath87 , no solutions to ( [ eq3 ] ) exist .",
    "@xmath88    @xmath89    @xmath90    @xmath91    @xmath92    @xmath93    the type iii solutions have @xmath94 . in this case , the metric is given by @xmath95 and the scale factor is @xmath96 where @xmath97 the values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the same as those given in ( [ lambda2 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "the potential @xmath29 is @xmath100    if @xmath58 , @xmath22 turns out to be a time coordinate , while for @xmath77 , it is a spatial coordinate . from the twelve cases shown in @xcite we choose those where it is a spatial coordinate .",
    "for all these solutions the condition ( [ condition2 ] ) applies .",
    "this case describes a topological black hole in ads space . from fig.[t3-branea ]",
    "we can see the region where ( [ condition2 ] ) holds .",
    "there are no shortcuts in this interval , and all the geodesics follow the brane and then either diverge to infinity or fall into the event horizon .",
    "we again have a topological black hole in ads space .",
    "there is a small interval where ( [ eq3 ] ) has solution as we can see from fig.[t3-braneb](a ) .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[t3-braneb](b ) .",
    "notice that the domain wall equation of motion has a solution only inside the interval shown there .",
    "this means that only a group of geodesics with initial velocity @xmath103 can meet the domain wall after a roundabout in the bulk .",
    "it is also shown that negative initial velocities force geodesics to fall into the event horizon .",
    "the black hole in ads space appearing here has round spatial section . in this case",
    "@xmath81 is always positive ( then @xmath22 is always a spatial coordinate ) ; however , as we must fulfill ( [ condition2 ] ) , we should notice that @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "we found that shortcuts are possible for several initial velocities if @xmath107 .    the case @xmath56 is shown in fig.[t3-braned ] .",
    "we have two regions of interest after the event horizon depending only on the sign of @xmath82 since @xmath81 is positive in this range . in the first region",
    "all the geodesics initially follow the brane and fall into the event horizon at later times . in the second region",
    "we have shortcuts again for several initial velocities .      here",
    "@xmath81 is always positive while @xmath82 is negative in the range shown in fig.[t3-branee ] .",
    "the domain wall and the geodesics diverge after some time near the end of the range where ( [ eq3 ] ) has a solution .      in this case",
    "@xmath81 is always positive while @xmath82 is negative for a small range as seen in fig.[t3-branef ] .",
    "there are several shortcuts in the region where the domain wall equation of motion has solution ; nevertheless , there is a threshold velocity after which the geodesics can not return . as we can notice from fig.[t3-branef](b ) , the last curve displayed here ( @xmath108 ) can not be consider a real shortcut since it is not a continuous solution of the geodesic equation , but represents a transition between shortcuts and geodesics falling into the naked singularity .",
    "now @xmath81 is always positive and @xmath82 will determine the initial condition for the domain wall equation of motion . as we can see from fig.[t3-braneg ] , several shortcuts appear .",
    "the time delay between the photon traveling on the domain wall and the gravitons traveling in the bulk @xcite can be calculated as follows .",
    "since the signals cover the same distance , @xmath109 the difference between photon and graviton time of flight can approximately be written as @xmath110 or in terms of the bulk time @xmath111 the elapsed bulk time @xmath17 , the corresponding domain wall time @xmath26 and the delays ( [ delay ] ) are shown in table [ sc ] for all the shortcut examples considered in the present paper .",

    "we have considered here again the question of shortcuts in a universe described by a membrane embeded in a bulk with two extra dimensions , the so called dowainwall , described by einstein gravity with a scalar field . in @xcite",
    "the full set of solutions of the brane equation of motion and israel conditions at the wall has been obtained .",

    "may appear if a certain range of parameters is chosen @xcite .",
    "later , we proved that in a dynamical brane universe shortcuts are actually quite common and may provide an alternative explanation to the horizon problem .    indeed ,",
    "if gravitational shortcuts are common before nucleosynthesis in a realistic model , they may provide an alternative to inflation in order to thermalize the early universe . in the present model , where the universe is replaced by a domain wall",
