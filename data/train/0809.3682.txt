    "first , consider the situation that there are @xmath0 teams in a sport league and we have to make a schedule for any pair of teams to play exactly one match in @xmath1 days . @xmath2",
    "games are held simultaneously everyday .",
    "we have to make a schedule which have @xmath4 games in @xmath1 days .",
    "each team plays against every other team .",
    "such a tournament method is called a round robin tournament in the literature .    the schedule that we consider must obey the following constraint .",
    "the schedule must be compatible with the given table which defines the stadium availability for each day and each team . such a table is called a home and away pattern(hap ) table .",
    "a hap table has an entry of a home game(h ) or an away game(a ) for each day and each team . a home game is a game at the own stadium , and an away game is a game at the stadium of the opponent team . for a team and a date , the hap table gives one of h and a. we assume that two teams can not play against each other for a day unless one team is assigned to a home game and the other team is assigned to an away game on that day . on a day , a team which is assigned to a home game is called a home team , and a team which is assigned to an away game is called an away team .",
    "the existence of a schedule that satisfies the property above depends upon a hap table . to begin with ,",
    "we consider the following problem . what hap table has a schedule compatible with the hap table for any pair of teams to play against each other ?",
    "a schedule compatible with the hap table means a schedule satisfying the constraint of the hap table .",
    "for example , we consider the hap table with four teams in table [ tab : hap ] .    .hap table for four teams [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a pair @xmath5 of teams can not play against each other on the first day because both teams are home teams on the first day .",
    "but @xmath6 can play against each other on the first day because team 1 is assigned to a home game and team 3 is assigned to an away game .",
    "consider the schedule such that two matches @xmath7 are held on the first day , two matches @xmath8 are held on the second day , and two matches @xmath9 are held on the third day .",
    "this schedule satisfies the constraint that any pair of two teams which play against each other is a pair of a home team and an away team .    the problem that we consider here is a kind of sports scheduling problems . for details , see d. de werra@xcite and r. miyashiro , h. iwasaki , and t. matsui@xcite .",
    "r. miyashiro , h. iwasaki , and t. matsui@xcite proposed a necessary condition for a hap table to have a schedule compatible with the hap table , but it is not sufficient .",
    "recently , d. briskorn@xcite proposed a new necessary condition for a hap table to have a compatible schedule .",
    "this necessary condition is described by linear inequalities .",
    "he conjectured that such a condition is also sufficient .",
    "his conjecture is that the linear inequalities must have an integral solution whenever they have a non - integral solution . in this paper , we rewrite his conjecture in terms of perfect matchings .",
    "rewriting the conjecture in terms of perfect matchings gives us a method to attack the conjecture by computer calculation .",
    "we confirm the conjecture for the complete graph on 6 vertices in theorem [ thm : nocount6 ] by computing the hilbert basis of an affine monoid generated by perfect matchings .    by using the hilbert basis , the problem is naturally generalized to a schedule for not all pairs of teams .",
    "while the complete graph corresponds to the scheduling problem for all pairs of teams , a regular graph corresponds to the scheduling problem for not all pairs of teams .",
    "for example , consider the league consisting of the teams in the west league and the teams in the east league , and the tournament such that each team in the west league and each team in the east league should play against each other exactly once .",
    "such a tournament is represented by the complete bipartite graph .",
    "we show that there exists a regular graph to which the corresponding problem has a non - integral solution but does not have any integral solution .",
    "that is , the statement generalizing the conjecture does not hold for some graphs .",
    "we discuss which regular graph satisfies the statement generalizing the conjecture .",
    "we show that any antiprism on even vertices does not satisfy the statement generalizing the conjecture in theorem [ thm : antiprism ]",
    ". we also give a cubic bipartite graph which does not satisfy the statement generalizing the conjecture in example [ ex : cubicbib ] .",

    "the set of all the equal partitions on @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "it is not important which indicates home games and which indicates away games in the two sets because that is irrelevant to whether there exists a solution or not .",

    "[ ex : sixcrown ]    the number of all the equal partitions @xmath21 on the set of size 6 is 10 . the number of edges of the complete graph whose vertex set has size 6 is 15 .",

    "recall that the non - b - factorizable graph on 6 vertices shown in example [ ex : sixcrown ] is also an antiprism . generally , the following statement holds .",
    "[ thm : antiprism ] any antiprism on even vertices is not b - factorizable .    the period of the schedule that we should consider is four days because the degree of the regular graph of the antiprism is 4 . construct a hap table for 4 days .",

    "then the matchable edges , which connect between h and a vertices , are colored .",
    "we want to make a hap table by swapping h and a for a pair of adjacent vertices on the outer circle so that it has a hamilton cycle consisting of matchable edges . for a fixed day",

    "the hamilton cycle consists of the edges in two perfect matchings .",
    "we regard the distance between pair @xmath200 and pair @xmath201 as 2 . as you see , by swapping h and a for some pairs so that each pair of swapping pairs has a distance of at least 3 , the number of perfect matchings consisting of matchable edges keeps exactly 2 .",
    "there exist @xmath188 edges @xmath202 on the outer circle .",
    "we want to swap h and a for any adjacent pair on the outer circle at once for the four days so that the antiprism has a double - edge covering consisting of perfect matchings compatible with the hap table .",
    "if such a hap table exists , we have @xmath192 and @xmath84 .    we show that we can obtain a desired swapping .",
    "we have already discussed the antiprism on 6 vertices , which is not b - factorizable , in example [ ex : sixcrown ] .",

    "we already know whether a given @xmath46-regular graph on 6 vertices is b - factorizable or not by calculating the hilbert basis of @xmath78 on 6 vertices . so the complete bipartite graph @xmath181 is b - factorizable .",
    "[ thm : k44 ] the complete bipartite graph @xmath213 is b - factorizable .",
    "the proof relies on the calculation by normaliz .",

    "if there exists no additional generator , it turns out that the graph is b - factorizable .",
    "but , the generating vectors of the monoid for the complete bipartite graph @xmath213 are too large to calculate at one time by normaliz .",
    "we divide it into cases to reduce the generating vectors .",
    "the equal partitions may be classified into three types according to the number of home games in one partite set of the complete bipartite graph as in figure [ fig : bib44 ] . in the figure , a matchable edge , which connects between h and a ,",
    "is colored .    ,",

    "so we confirmed that @xmath214 such that @xmath71 is @xmath213 implies @xmath215 .",
    "so @xmath213 turned out to be b - factorizable .",
    "we still do not know whether the complete bipartite graphs with more vertices than @xmath213 are b - factorizable or not .",
    "however , we may conjecture the following .",
    "every complete bipartite graph @xmath216 is b - factorizable .",
    "what class of regular graphs consists of b - factorizable graphs ? is any cubic graph b - factorizable ?",
    "the answer is no .",

    "since there exists a double - edge covering of this graph compatible with the hap table , we have @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath219 because the petersen graph does not have any 3-edge - coloring .",
    "therefore @xmath19 becomes an additional generator , and the petersen graph is not b - factorizable .",
    "the following example shows that the converse of lemma [ lem : addb ] does not hold .",
    "this example is not a cubic graph but related with the petersen graph , which is cubic .",
    "[ ex : petersen1 ] consider @xmath52 such that @xmath71 is the graph expressed in figure [ fig : pet2 ] and the ha components are determined by the colors of the small circles in the figure .",

    "so @xmath19 is not an additional generator since @xmath19 does not belong to the hilbert basis .",
    "the next example shows that there exists a 3-regular bipartite graph which is not b - factorizable .",
    "[ ex : cubicbib ]    consider the cubic bipartite graph on 20 vertices illustrated in figure [ fig:3reg ] .",
    "consider the vector @xmath69 represented by the graph and the colored small circles in the figure . since there exists a double - edge covering of the graph compatible with the hap table , we have @xmath192 and @xmath84 .",

    "we try to make a 3-edge - coloring of the graph compatible with the hap table .",
    "it is easy to see that any edge that has double edges in the same color can not have another color in any 3-edge - coloring .",
    "therefore the possible colors of each of the other edges are narrowed down to two colors .",
    "but we can not complete edge - coloring by picking up one color from the possible two colors .",
    "choosing one color in the two colors induces a contradiction .",
    "so @xmath19 does not belong to @xmath78 .",
    "so this graph is not b - factorizable .",
    "since @xmath19 can not be divided into two distinct vectors in @xmath77 , @xmath19 is an additional generator .",
    "to summarize our discussions so far , the b - factorizability for a @xmath188-regular graph with a hap table is related with @xmath188-edge - coloring compatible with the hap table .",
    "moreover , we point out here that it may be related with the arguments about the @xmath188-edge - colorability for @xmath188-regular graphs in the standard graph theory , i.e. without the hap table , though it is not known that one statement implies directly another statement .",
