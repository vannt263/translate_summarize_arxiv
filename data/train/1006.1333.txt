    "a large variety of compounds belonging to the iron - based superconductors have been found since the discovery of superconductivity in @xmath1 in the beginning of 2008 @xcite .",
    "they can be classified into four different families , divided by stoichiometric differences , exhibiting superconducting ( sc ) behavior induced by hole - doping , electron - doping as well as solely the application of high pressure ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "all compounds are layered materials with a common layer of an iron - pnictide in between different spacing layers or simply layers of @xmath2 .",
    "so the location of the sc inducing physics is the tetragonal @xmath3-containing layer leading to highly two dimensional ( 2d ) electronic structure @xcite .",
    "angle resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) finds several bands crossing the fermi surface @xcite ( fs ) which is a novelty since , with the exception of mgb@xmath4 , superconductors have been most often treated as single band materials .",
    "the mechanism that leads to superconductivity including the pairing symmetry of the sc order parameter is still under debate ( a theoretical review is provided by ref .",
    "gap symmetries both with nodes ( @xmath5-wave or @xmath6-wave ) and without nodes ( @xmath7-wave ) are still under consideration @xcite",
    ".    electronic raman scattering ( for a review see @xcite ) could clarify some of those unresolved issues . in the light scattering experiment different parts of the brillouin zone ( bz ) can be emphasized with different weights through the selection of incident and outgoing light polarizations with respect of the crystallographic directions .",
    "thus by manipulating the directions of the polarization vectors of the incident and scattered photons in a raman experiment , it is possible to determine the symmetry of the pair - breaking excitations related to the symmetry of the sc order parameter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the low energy tail of the raman responses can be used to distinguish between a fully gaped fs or a sc gap with nodes allowing the excitation of quasi particles at arbitrarily small energies .",
    "the theory of electronic raman spectroscopy in superconductors @xcite has been very successful in applications to high - t@xmath8 cuprates @xcite and now allows to make predictions for the raman responses of the iron - pnictides .",
    "recently model calculations of expected raman responses for a superconductor with multi - band order parameter and including the long - range coulomb interactions responsible for the multi - band screening effects have been performed by boyd et .",
    "these calculations used multiple circular fs sheets as a band structure and for the majority of the work the raman vertices are obtained by an expansion into fs harmonics for cylindrical fs . taking the screening of the charged background into account but leaving out vertex corrections capturing effects of final state interactions a variety of different gap distributions on the fs sheets with and without nodes were used .",
    "thus many different forms were obtained for the raman responses which show the possible scenarios expected from the data . by comparing the singularities in different symmetry channels of such calculated raman responses with the peak structure of actual raman data",
    "the reconstruction of the momentum and frequency dependence of the superconducting order parameter , critical to understanding of the superconducting mechanism in these materials , is possible . in another study",
    "@xcite it has been established by analyses of the vertex corrections that for an @xmath0 extended @xmath7-wave gap symmetry , the @xmath0 raman response has a true collective mode resonance peak below the fundamental gap @xmath9 .",
    "since the collective mode is predicted only for this particular pairing symmetry , conscientious polarization resolved low - frequency raman scattering study of the iron - pnictide materials may provide a way to unambiguously distinguish between various suggested gap symmetries .",
    "very recently the first electronic raman scattering experiments on @xmath10 , a member of the 122-family , have been performed @xcite showing a change of the raman response in the sc state only in the @xmath0 and @xmath11 channel .",
    "a clear peak of @xmath12-singularity shape in the latter one and a broader peak in the former one at a slightly higher energy are observed and the low energy shape is interpreted as evidence for accidental gap nodes .    in this paper model calculations of raman responses for a multiband free electron model",
    "are performed . in chapter",
    "ii the general theory of raman scattering in the sc state is presented and explicit forms of the raman vertices and an analytical expression for the raman susceptibility are calculated for a 2d tetragonal symmetry and a constant sc gap . then the screening correction is taken into account adding an extra term in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "multiband effects in this symmetry channel for two and more than two bands with an example of a four band response are presented in chapter iii .",
    "the general effects found in chapter iii are used in chapter iv to explain the raman responses for a band structure model inspired by arpes data .",
    "first a constant gap and then a @xmath13-dependent gap of extended @xmath7-wave symmetry is used for which the single band structure is investigated with an only angular dependent model gap .",
    "finally the raman response with the extended s - wave gap is compared to experimental data and it is shown that the band structure model can be modified to come to acceptable agreement .",
    "it is important to note that final state interactions leading to vertex corrections are neglected in this work .",
    "the consequences of including vertex corrections that could give rise to resonance modes or notably modify the raman response are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , this work focuses on multiband screening effects and features of vertex corrections are left for future publications .",
    "the fact that in the applied assumptions analytical calculations are possible allows us to find the origin of the obtained general mutliband effects in the screened @xmath0 channel . with that the shape of the numerically calculated raman responses for the particular band structure with extended s - wave symmetry",
    "can be explained and further applications to other multiband sc might follow .",
    "furthermore the nature of the main features of the single band raman responses with the extended s - wave gap are identified analytically with a simplified model gap .",
    "thus our work adds further details to the previous study by boyd et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "the raman process is inelastic scattering of light in which the energy shift @xmath14 between the incident photon ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and the scattered photon ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) is measured . in the case of electronic raman scattering",

    "the energy difference between those two states corresponds to the energy loss of the photon .",
    "it can be shown that the cross section of the scattered light is proportional to the imaginary part of the raman susceptibility @xcite which is defined in linear response theory in the following way @xmath20 \\right\\ }      \\label{eq : deframansuscep}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is boltzmann s constant ) , @xmath24 is the partition function and @xmath25 is the hamiltonian of the unperturbated system . the perturbation hamiltonian @xmath26 is proportional to the effective density operator @xcite @xmath27 which contains fermionic annihilation @xmath28 and creation @xmath29 operators in the @xmath30 band . furthermore @xmath31 is proportional to the so called raman vertex @xmath32 which depends on the polarization direction of the incident and scattered photon and thus on the experimental setup ( light polarizers ) .",
    "this quantity will be specified and discussed in detail in the next paragraph . with the wavelength of the incident and scattered photon being in or near the visible spectrum the corresponding wave vectors and",
    "therefore also their difference @xmath33 is much smaller than @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the sc gap and @xmath36 is the component of the fermi velocity along q ) .",
    "this makes the @xmath37 limit a reasonable simplification that leads to the explicit form of the raman susceptibility in the sc state @xmath38 the quantity @xmath39 is the tsuneto function @xcite @xmath40 with the sc gap @xmath41 , the sc quasi particle energy @xmath42 and a small broadening factor @xmath43 .",
    "this function represents the creation of quasi particles out of the sc condensate .",
    "the first term is proportional to a sc coherence factor and is unity at the fermi momentum .",
    "the further away from @xmath19 the quasi particles are created the smaller this factor gets so the major contribution to the raman response originates from the vicinity of the @xmath19 .",
    "the second term is a statistical factor that takes into account already thermally excited quasi particles . since the following calculations are made under the assumption that @xmath44 this factor is simply unity .",
    "the third term takes care of the necessary energy conservation and excludes a creation of quasi particles inside the sc gap .",
    "now the raman vertex will be specified by an analytical expression . in the nonresonant case , where the electronic excitation does not include a real intermediate state ,",
    "the raman vertex can be calculated with an effective mass approximation @xcite in the following form @xmath45 with @xmath46 denoting the electrons mass and @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the light polarization vectors of the scattered and incident photon , respectively . in this approximation",
    "the raman vertex is proportional to the second derivative ( curvature ) of the band energy dispersion in the particular @xmath13-direction selected by the two light polarization vectors which is proportional to the inverse effective mass of the band in @xmath49 - theory .",

    "a 2d free electron model for the band structure will be used which results in a constant vertex for the @xmath0 channel since the second derivative of the energy band dispersion is proportional to the constant inverse effective mass @xmath59 of the band . for a parabolic band all other symmetry channels are vanishing which is a consequence of the effective mass approximation in combination with a free electron model .",
    "this leads to the focus of the following investigations being on the fully symmetric @xmath0 channel .",
    "a tight binding model , which is the next possible step , will not lead to vanishing vertices for the non fully symmetric channels ( except @xmath60 , the symmetry of the antisymmetric tensor @xcite , which is usually negligible ) .    using a 2d free electron model for the energy dispersion of the @xmath30 band , which is determined by the effective mass @xmath61 and the chemical potential @xmath62 ,",
