    "a study on the dynamics of charged dust particles solves the equation of motion along with the evolution of electrical charge , which requires the knowledge of photoelectric current .",
    "because the photoelectric current is proportional to the photoelectric quantum yield , the small particle effect of photoelectron emission affects the determination of electrical charge .",

    "in contrast , our model ( i.e. , with the surface curvature ) gives @xmath73 , which clearly demonstrates the importance of the surface curvature .",
    "therefore , we claim that any forthcoming study on the dynamics of charged nanoparticles should implement the small particle effect with the surface curvature in the study .",
    "a series of experimental experiments on the photoelectric quantum yields for submicron to micron - sized grains with astronomically relevant materials was performed by @xcite at photon energies of 7.8 , 8.9 , and @xmath74 .",
    "their experimental results show that the photoelectric quantum yields increase with grain size , contrary to not only theoretical works but also previous experimental works on the small particle effect of photoelectron emission ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite claim that the photoelectric quantum yield of silver nanoparticles measured by @xcite shows the size dependence consistent with their experiments .",
    "however , we notice that the total number of photoelectrons ejected from a particle per _ incident _ photon in the experiments of @xcite does not show a clear difference between the particles with @xmath75 , 3.8 , and @xmath76 within the uncertainties .",
    "note that the total number of photoelectrons ejected from a particle per _ incident _ photon is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the absorption efficiency of photons , because @xmath3 is the total number of electrons ejected from a particle per _ absorbed _ photon . because @xmath79 for photon energies used their experiments , it is natural to expect that the photoelectric quantum yields of silver nanoparticles measured by @xcite increase with decreasing grain size .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that @xcite were the first to experimentally determine @xmath77 near threshold for silver nanoparticles with @xmath80 , 2.7 , and @xmath81 and to show the increase in @xmath77 with decreasing particle size . because of @xmath79 for the nanoparticles with @xmath80 , 2.7 , and @xmath81 near the threshold , it is evident that the photoelectric quantum yields of silver nanoparticles decreases with particle size , at odds with the claim by @xcite .    from theoretical and past experimental points of view ,",
    "the experiments of @xcite show contrary results on the size dependence of photoelectric quantum yields for small particles .",
    "furthermore , their asymptotic values of the photoelectric quantum yields for large grains are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of bulk samples .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that their estimates of photoelectric quantum yields require knowledge of discharge rates at zero grain charge , but they could measure the rates only down to about 10 electrons . in the case of constant discharge rates , an extrapolation of the measured discharge rates to zero grain charge",
    "is remarkably straightforward .",
    "however , this was not the case for the experiments of @xcite , although discharge rates for negatively charge particles under a fixed photon flux must be constant in theory ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we can not help speculating that the discharge rates at zero grain charge have not been properly derived from their experiments , in particular , for micron - sized grains",
    ".    we have improved @xcite s model for the small particle effect of photoelectron emission by taking the surface curvature of the particle into consideration , which has long been recognized as a missing piece of the model . however , both the current study and @xcite s model , which are based on the three step model , do not take into account the energy distribution of electrons at their production inside a particle .",
    "therefore , a more sophisticated model needs to include the electron energy distribution inside a particle , although the electron energy distribution must be known a priori .",
    "while numerical demonstration of such a model is beyond the scope of this paper , here we briefly note the formula : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the energy distribution of electrons in the energy range from @xmath20 to @xmath84 .",
    "it is obvious that eq .",
    "( [ pee - sphere - correct ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ pee - sphere ] ) , when @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the dirac @xmath86 function . consequently ,",
