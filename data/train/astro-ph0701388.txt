    "for the discussion of many astrophysical problems where gravity is important , a major difficulty is set by the potential theory . in general , to calculate the gravitational potential associated with a given density distribution one has to evaluate a three - dimensional integral .",
    "except for special circumstances , where a solution can be found in terms of elementary functions , one has to resort to numerical techniques and sophisticated tools , such as expansions in orthogonal functions or integral transforms .    under spherical symmetry ,",
    "the density - potential relation can be reduced to a one - dimensional integral , while for axisymmetric systems one in general is left with a ( usually non - trivial ) two - dimensional integral . as a result",
    ", the majority of the available explicit density - potential pairs refers to spherical symmetry and only few axially symmetric pairs are known ( e.g. , see binney & tremaine 1987 , hereafter bt ) . in special cases ( in particular , when a density - potential pair can be expressed in a suitable parametric form ) there exist systematic procedures to generate new non - trivial density - potential pairs ( e.g. , see the case of miyamoto & nagai 1975 and the related satoh 1980 disks ; see also evans & de zeeuw 1992 ; de zeeuw & carollo 1996 ) . for non - axisymmetric systems the situation is worse .",
    "one class of triaxial density distributions for which the potential can be expressed in a tractable integral form is that of the stratified homeoids , such as the ferrers ( 1887 ) distributions ( e.g. , see pfenniger 1984 , lanzoni & ciotti 2003 , and references therein ) and special cases of the family considered by de zeeuw & pfenniger ( 1988 ) .",
    "additional explicit density - potential pairs are given by the evans ( 1994 ) models and by those constructed with the kutuzov - osipkov method ( 1980 , see also kutuzov 1998 ) .",
    "another way to construct in a systematic way explicit density - potential pairs with finite deviations from spherical symmetry has been presented in ciotti & bertin ( 2005 ) .",
    "this technique is based on an elementary property of the asymptotic expansion of the homeoidal potential quadrature formula for small flattenings , and recently , it has been applied to the modeling of gaseous halos in clusters ( lee & suto 2003 , 2004 ) , to the study of the dynamics of elliptical galaxies ( muccione & ciotti 2003 , 2004 ) , and finally to a possible interpretation of the rotational field of the extraplanar gas in disk galaxies ( barnab et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .    in the context of classical electrodynamics",
    "a truly remarkable and seamingly unrelated result has been obtained by newman ( 1973 , see also newman & janis 1965 , newman et al .",
    "1965 ) , who considered the case of the electromagnetic field of a point charge displaced on the imaginary axis . successive analysis of carter ( 1968 ) , lynden - bell ( 2000 , 2002 , 2004ab , and references therein ; see also teukolsky , 1973 ; chandrasekhar , 1976 ; page , 1976 ) , and kaiser ( 2004 , and references therein ) revealed the astonishing properties of the resulting holomorphic `` magic '' field .",
    "as pointed out to us by the referee , the complex - shift method was first introduced by appell ( 1887 , see also whittaker & watson 1950 ) to the case of the gravitational field of a point mass , and successively used in general relativity ( e.g. , see gleiser & pullin 1989 ; letelier & oliveira 1987 , 1998 ; dafonseca , letelier & oliveira , 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we show how the complex - shift method can be also applied in classical gravitation to obtain exact and explicit density - potential pairs deviating significantly from spherical simmetry ; we are not aware that this possibility has been noticed in the literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we present the idea behind the method , and we discuss its application to the case of spherical systems , describing two new self - gravitating and axisymmetric systems obtained from the plummer and isochrone spheres . in sect .",
    "3 we focus on the rotational fields of the new pairs when interpreted as gaseous systems .",
    "section 4 summarizes the main results obtained , while in the appendix we present the peculiar behavior of the singular isothermal sphere under the action of the complex shift .",
    "we start by extending the complexification of a point charge coulomb field discussed by lynden - bell ( 2004b ) , to the gravitational potential @xmath0 generated by a density distribution @xmath1 . from now on @xmath2 will indicate the position vector , while @xmath3 is the standard inner product over the reals ( repeated index summation convention implied ) .",
    "let assume that the ( nowhere negative ) density distribution @xmath4 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath5 and that the associated complexified potential @xmath6 with shift @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the imaginary unit and @xmath10 is a real vector .",
    "the idea behind the proposed method is based on the recognition that 1 ) the poisson equation is a linear pde , and that 2 ) the complex shift is a linear coordinate transformation . from these two properties , and from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 )",
    "it follows that @xmath11 where @xmath12 thus , by separating the real and imaginary parts of @xmath6 and @xmath13 obtained from the shift of a known real density - potential pair one obtains _ two _ real density - potential pairs .",
    "a distinction is in order here between electrostatic and gravitational problems : in fact , while in the former case a density ( charge ) distribution with negative and positive regions can be ( at least formally ) accepted , in the gravitational case the obtained density components have physical meaning only if they do not change sign ( see however sect .",
    "4 ) . quite interestingly , some general result about the sign of the real and imaginary parts of the shifted density can be obtained by considering the behavior of the complexified self - gravitational energy and total mass .",
    "in fact , from the linearity of the shift , it follows that the volume integral over the entire space @xmath14 d^3\\xv\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] coincides with the self - gravitational energy @xmath15 of the real unshifted seed density .",
    "thus the imaginary part of @xmath16 is zero , i.e. @xmath17                    d^3\\xv&=&\\nonumber\\\\            -g\\int\\int{\\re[\\rhoc ( \\xv)]\\im[\\rhoc(\\xv ' ) ] \\over ||\\xv-\\xv'|| }                    d^3\\xv d^3\\xv ' & = & 0 , \\label{wcim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath16 is the difference of the gravitational energies of the real and the imaginary parts of the shifted density .",
    "the vanishing of the double integral ( [ wcim ] ) shows that the integrand necessarily changes sign , i.e. , the complex shift can not generate _ two _ physically acceptable densities .",
    "additional informations are provided by considering that , for the same reasons just illustrated , also the total mass of the complexified distribution @xmath18 coincides with the total ( real ) mass of the seed density distribution @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 identities  ( [ wcim])-([imm ] ) then leave open the question whether at least @xmath21 can be characterized by a single sign over the whole space .",
    "it results that either cases can happen , depending on the specific seed density and shift vector adopted .",
    "in fact , in the following section we show that simple seed densities exist so that @xmath21 is positive everywhere , while in the appendix we present a simple case in which also @xmath21 changes sign .",
    "we now restrict the previous general considerations to a spherically symmetric real potential @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the standard euclidean norm .",
    "after the complex shift the norm must be still interpreted over the reals . ]",
    "( e.g. , see lynden - bell 2004b ) , so that @xmath24 where @xmath25 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume @xmath26 , and the shifted radial coordinate becomes @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the colatitude of the considered point , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 @xmath31 note that , when starting from a spherically symmetric seed system , the real and immaginary parts of the shifted density @xmath13 can be obtained 1 ) from evaluation of the laplace operator applied to the real and imaginary parts of the potential @xmath6 , 2 ) by expansion of the complexified density in equation  ( [ eqrhoc ] ) , or finally 3 ) by considering that for spherically symmetric systems @xmath32 , and so the real and imaginary parts of @xmath33 can be expressed ( at least in principle ) as functions of the real and imaginary part of the shifted potential .      as a first example , in this section we apply the complex shift to the plummer ( 1911 ) sphere .",
    "we start from the relative potential @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is normalized to the model scale - lenght @xmath37 , so that the associated density distribution is @xmath38 ( e.g. , see bt ) .",

    "also @xmath64 is negative for @xmath65 , as can be seen from equation  ( [ plumimrho ] ) , and thus can not be used to describe a gravitational system ; we do not discuss this pair any further , while we focus on the real components of the shifted density - potential pair .",

    "in addition , on the model equatorial plane @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the cylindrical radius ) , @xmath62 coincides with the potential of a plummer sphere of scale - lenght @xmath79 , and from equation  ( [ plumrerho ] ) it follows that @xmath80 for @xmath75 .",
    "however , for @xmath81 a negative term is present in equation  ( [ plumrerho ] ) , and the positivity of @xmath21 is not guaranteed for a generic value of the shift parameter in the range @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , a numerical exploration reveals that @xmath21 becomes negative on the symmetry axis @xmath82 at @xmath83 for @xmath84 ; the negative density region then expands around this critical point for increasing @xmath85 .",
    "the isodensity contours of @xmath21 in a meridional plane are shown in the top panels of fig .",
    "1 , for shift parameter values @xmath86 ( left ) and @xmath87 ( right ) .",
    "the most salient property is the resulting toroidal shape of the model with the large shift , which reminds similar structures known in the literature , as the lynden - bell ( 1962 ) flattened plummer sphere , the densities associated with the binney ( 1981 ) logarithmic potential and the evans ( 1994 ) scale - free potentials , the toomre ( 1982 ) and ciotti & bertin ( 2005 ) tori ( see also ciotti , bertin , & londrillo 2004 ) , and the exact mond density - potential pairs discussed in ciotti , nipoti & londrillo ( 2006 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to find the explanation ( if any ) behind this similarity ( see however sect .",

    "again , @xmath63 changes sign when crossing the model equatorial plane , revealing that also @xmath64 changes sign in order to produce the resulting vertical force field near @xmath76 , and the vanishing of the integral in equation  ( [ imm ] ) . in accordance with equation  ( [ eqrhoc ] ) on the model",
    "equatorial plane @xmath21 is functionally identical to an isochrone sphere of scale - lenght @xmath79 ( and so positive for @xmath75 ) , while for @xmath70 @xmath95 @xmath96 as for the shifted plummer sphere , also in this case @xmath21 coincides in the far field with the seed density , and so it is positive for @xmath75 , while it becomes negative on the @xmath97 axis at @xmath98 for @xmath99 . in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "1 we show the isodensity contours in the meridional plane of @xmath21 for the representative values of the shift parameter @xmath86 ( left ) and @xmath100 ( right ) : again , the toroidal shape and the critical regions on the symmetry axis are apparent in the case of the larger shift .",
    "a natural question to ask is about the nature of the kinematical fields that can be supported by the found density - potential pairs @xmath101 when considered as self - gravitating stellar systems . in general , the associated two - integrals jeans equations ( e.g. , bt , ciotti 2000 ) can be solved numerically after having fixed the relative amount of ordered streaming motions and velocity dispersion in the azimuthal direction ( e.g. , see satoh 1980 , ciotti & pellegrini 1996 ) . for simplicity here we restrict to the investigation of the isotropic case , when the resulting jeans equations are formally identical to the equations describing axysimmetric , self - gravitating gaseous systems in permanent rotation : @xmath102 ( in order to simplify the notation , in the following we intend @xmath103 $ ] and @xmath104 $ ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 denote the fluid density , pressure and angular velocity , respectively ; the rotational ( i.e. , streaming ) velocity is @xmath108 , while @xmath109 .    in problems where @xmath105 and @xmath110 are assigned , the standard approach for the solution of equations  ( [ eq.hydro ] ) is to integrate for the pressure with boundary condition @xmath111 , @xmath112 and then to obtain the rotational velocity field from the radial equation @xmath113 however , @xmath114 can be also obtained without previous knowledge of @xmath106 , because by combining equations  ( [ pressione])-([velocita ] ) and integrating by parts with the assumption that @xmath115 for @xmath116 it follows that @xmath117 we remark that this `` commutator - like '' relation is not new ( e.g. , see rosseland 1926 , waxmann 1978 , and , in the context of stellar dynamics , hunter 1977 ) .    before solving equations  ( [ eq.hydro ] ) for the real parts of the density - potential pairs of sect .",
    "2 , it is useful to recall some basic property of rotating fluid configurations .",
    "for example , in several astrophysical application ( e.g. , the set - up of initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations ) , equations  ( [ eq.hydro ] ) are solved for the density under the assumption of a barotropic pressure distribution ( and neglecting the gas self - gravity ) , and for assigned @xmath118 or @xmath119 . as well known , this approach can lead only to hydrostatic ( @xmath120 ) or _ cylindrical rotation _ ( @xmath121 $ ] ) kinematical fields .",
    "in fact , according to the poincar - wavre theorem ( e.g. , see lebovitz 1967 , tassoul 1980 ) , cylindrical rotation is _ equivalent _ to barotropicity , or to the fact that the acceleration field at the r.h.s . of equations  ( [ eq.hydro ] )",
    "derives from the effective potential @xmath122 ( where @xmath123 is an arbitrary but fixed radius ) , so that the gas density and pressure are stratified on @xmath124",
    ".    however , barotropic equilibria are just a very special class of solutions of equations  ( [ eq.hydro ] ) .",
    "for example , in the context of galactic dynamics isotropic axisymmetric galaxy models often show streaming velocities dependent on @xmath97 ( for simple examples see , e.g. , lanzoni & ciotti 2003 , ciotti & bertin 2005 ) .",
    "such _ baroclinic _ configurations ( i.e. , fluid systems in which @xmath106 can not be expressed as a function of @xmath105 only , and",
    "@xmath124 does not exist at all ) , have been studied in the past for problems ranging from geophysics , to the theory of sunspots and stellar rotation ( e.g. , see rosseland 1926 ) , and to the problem of modeling the decrease of rotational velocity of the extraplanar gas in disk galaxies for increassing @xmath97 ( e.g. , see barnab et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "note that a major problem posed by the construction of baroclinic solutions is the fact that the existence of _ physically acceptable solutions _",
    "( i.e. configurations for which @xmath125 everywhere ) is not guaranteed for arbitrary choices of @xmath105 and @xmath126 . however , the positivity of the integrand in equation  ( [ commutatore ] ) for @xmath127 is a sufficient condition to have @xmath128 everywhere .",
    "in fact , in barnab et al .",
    "( 2006 ) several theorems on baroclinic configurations have been proved starting from equation  ( [ commutatore ] ) : in particular _",
    "gas distributions are strongly favoured in order to have @xmath125 in presence of a dominating disk gravitational field .",
    "we note that also in the present cases the density is of toroidal shape , altough the distribution is self - gravitating .    -0.7truecm",
    "-1.7truecm     in the case of the @xmath129 pair of the shifted plummer sphere , the ( normalized ) commutator in equation  ( [ commutatore ] ) is a very simple function @xmath130 which is positive for @xmath131 and @xmath132 , so that @xmath125 as far as @xmath21 is positive everywhere , i.e. , for @xmath133 .",
    "remarkably , the integration of equation  ( [ commutatore ] ) can be easily carried out in terms of elementary functions @xmath134 \\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the direct integration of the pressure equation is much more complicate ( again showing the relevance of equation  [ [ commutatore ] ] in applications ) , and we report its normalized expression on the equatorial plane only @xmath135 note that @xmath136 , and so it vanishes ( as a consequence of the imposed isotropy ) when reducing to the spherically symmetric seed density : in fact , it can be proved that the argument in parenthesis in equation ( 40 ) is regular for @xmath137 .",
    "the baroclinic nature of the equilibrium is apparent , and confirmed by fig .",
    "2 , where we show the contours of constant @xmath114 for @xmath86 and @xmath138 ( top panels , correspondig to the models plotted in the top panels of fig .",
    "the normalized streaming velocity field in the equatorial plane is @xmath139 and has a maximum at @xmath140 , while the normalized circular velocity is the same as that of a plummer sphere of scale - lenght @xmath79 ( cf . the comment after equation [ 26 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath141 it is easy to verify that equations ( 41 ) and ( 42 ) satisfy equation ( 36 ) .    unfortunately , we were unable to obtain the explicit formulae for the analogous quantities for the shifted isochrone model . however , it is easy to prove that also in this case the commutator is proportional to @xmath142 , and so it vanishes ( as expected ) for @xmath137 .",
    "a comparison of the rotational fields of the two models in the far field can be obtained by using the asymptotic expressions ( 25)-(26 ) and ( 32)-(33 ) can be used . in particular , for the real part of the shifted plummer sphere we found @xmath143 while for @xmath21 of the isochrone shifted sphere @xmath144 note that , even though the radial asymptotic behavior of the density is different in the two considered cases , the obtained velocity field has the same radial dependence in the far field , and in both cases @xmath114 decreases for increasing @xmath97 and fixed @xmath78 . in addition , @xmath145 for @xmath70 , as expected from the spherical symmetry of the density and potential for @xmath70 : in fact , it is apparent from equation  ( [ commutatore ] ) that spherical ( additive ) components of @xmath105 and @xmath126 ( e.g. , the leading terms in the asymptotic expansions [ 25]-[26 ] and [ 32]-[33 ] ) mutually cancel in the commutator evaluation .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the complex - shift method , introduced in electrodynamics by newman , and throughly studied among others by carter , lynden - bell and kaiser , can be extended to classical gravitation to produce new and explicit density - potential pairs with finite deviation from spherical symmetry .",
    "in particular , we showed that after separation of the real and imaginary parts of the complexified density - potential pair , the imaginary part of the density corresponds to a system of null total mass , while the real component can be positive everywhere ( depending on the original seed density distribution and the amount of the complex shift ) .",
    "as simple application of the proposed method we illustrated the properties of the axysimmetric systems resulting from the shift of the plummer and isochrone spheres .",
    "the analysis revealed that the obtained densities are nowhere negative only for shift values in some restricted range .",
    "this property is linked to the presence of a flat `` core '' in the adopted ( spherically symmetric ) seed distributions .",
    "it is thus expected that also other distributions , such as the king ( 1972 ) model , and the dehenen ( 1993 ) and tremaine et al .",
    "( 1994 ) @xmath146 model , will lead to physically acceptable shifted systems .",
    "for the two new exact density - potential pairs we also found that the associated rotational fields ( obtained under the assumption of global isotropy of the velocity dispersion tensor ) correspond to baroclinic gaseous configurations",
    ".    an interesting issue raised by the present analysis is the toroidal shape of the obtained densities .",
    "while we were not able to find a general explanation of this phenomenon , some hints can be obtained by considering the behavior of the complex - shift for @xmath147 .",
    "in fact , in this case it can be easily proved that while the _ odd _ terms of the expansion correspond to the imaginary part fo the shifted density ( and contain the factor @xmath97 ) , the _ even _ terms are real and , to the second order in @xmath42 , @xmath148 this expansion is functionally similar to that obtained by ciotti & bertin ( 2005 ) for the case of oblate homeoidal distributions , where the term dependent on @xmath149 is immediately identified with a spherical harmonic ( e.g. , jackson 1999 ) responsible of the toroidal shape .",
    "it is clear that when restricting to the small - shift approximation ( 46 ) , all the computations presented in this paper can be carried out explicitly for simple seed distributions .",
    "moreover , from equation ( 46 ) it is easy to prove that negative values of density appears on the @xmath97 axis - no matter how much the shift parameter is small - when the seed density has a central cusp @xmath150 with @xmath151 ( e.g. , see the explicit example in appendix ) .    in this paper we restricted for simplicity to spherically simmetric seed systems , which produce axysimmetric systems",
    ". a natural extension of the present investigation would be the study of the density - potential pairs originated by the complex shift of seed disk distributions , such as the miyamoto & nagay ( 1975 ) and satoh ( 1980 ) disks , or even the generalization of homeoidal quadrature formulae ( e.g. , see kellogg 1953 , chandrasekhar 1969 , bt ) .",
    "note that in such cases , at variance with the spherical cases here discussed , the shift _ direction _ is important : for example , the complex shift of a disk along the @xmath97 axis will lead to a different system than an equatorial shift , that would produce a triaxial object .    a second interesting line of study could be the use of the complex - shift to produce more elaborate density - potential pairs by adding models with a weight function @xmath152 , i.e. , by considering the behavior of the linear operator @xmath153 where the integration is extended over some suitably chosen region .",
    "we do not pursue this line of investigation , but it is obvious that also shifted density components with negative regions can be accepted in this context , as far as one is able to construct a weight function leading to a final distribution nowhere negative ( as it happens , for example , in spherical harmonics expansions ) .",
