    "superconducting transport through low - dimensional nanoscale structures is currently attracting considerable interest .",
    "gate - tunable josephson currents through nanowire - based quantum dots have been reported,@xcite and similar setups have been realized using ( short ) carbon nanotubes@xcite and metallofullerene molecules.@xcite nonequilibrium transport in such systems contacted by superconducting electrodes has been a particular focus of recent experimental effort,@xcite mainly caused by an interesting interplay between interaction effects ( on the quantum dot ) and superconducting correlations ( due to the electrodes ) .",
    "one remarkable consequence is the observation of an ` even - odd ' effect ( as a function of the dot s occupation number ) in the conductance.@xcite this effect is presumably caused by the absence or presence of kondo correlations . in this paper , we analyze superconducting transport through an interacting quantum dot for the simplest case of a single spin - degenerate level with repulsive on - site interaction energy @xmath0 ( anderson impurity ) , contacted by two wide @xmath1-wave bcs superconducting electrodes with identical gap @xmath2 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that both lead - to - dot couplings ( hybridizations ) are equal , @xmath3 , and consider the two electrodes held at potential difference ( voltage bias ) @xmath4 . under a systematic perturbative expansion in the interaction strength @xmath5 , we compute the @xmath6 characteristics , in particular for the interesting subgap regime @xmath7 , where multiple andreev reflection ( mar ) processes provide the dominant transport mechanism .",
    "a theory of coherent mar has been originally developed for superconducting point contacts,@xcite with the essential assumption that charging interaction effects inside the contact can be neglected .",
    "the problem of resonant mar through a noninteracting quantum level has been treated in refs .  .",
    "while the interacting problem in equilibrium has been theoretically studied by many authors,@xcite the corresponding nonequilibrium problem is more difficult and far less understood .",
    "previous approaches can be broadly grouped in three classes .",
    "( i ) by ignoring mar processes in the coulomb blockade regime , additional side - peaks in the differential conductance at @xmath8 and @xmath9 were predicted,@xcite reflecting the singularity of the bcs spectral density of the leads .",
    "( ii ) different mean - field schemes have been proposed,@xcite based on slave - boson or hubbard - stratonovich - path - integral approaches .",
    "these calculations predict an overall suppression of the current by the interactions .",
    "this suppression is obtained only for sufficiently repulsive interactions , while there is no interaction effect for weak interaction.@xcite ( iii ) a fermi liquid approach valid in the deep kondo limit has been proposed.@xcite here we do not discuss the kondo regime , but instead focus on the limit of weak interactions , @xmath10 , where a controlled perturbative expansion in the small parameter @xmath11 is possible . note that this approach still allows for arbitrary ratio @xmath12 .",
    "such calculations have been carried out for normal - conducting ( @xmath13 ) electrodes recently,@xcite and we here generalize them to superconducting electrodes .",
    "the case @xmath14 is of experimental relevance for the understanding of superconducting transport through quantum dots or molecules with good lead - to - dot couplings .",
    "the structure of the remainder of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we discuss our perturbation theory approach to superconducting transport through an anderson dot , and its numerical implementation .",

    "the appendix contains qualitative arguments for the current enhancement found at @xmath15 , based on an evaluation of the josephson current .",
    "we often set @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the canonical anderson impurity model , @xmath17 , where a single - level dot with spinful fermion @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is tunnel - coupled ( @xmath20 ) to left / right superconducting reservoirs @xmath21 held at chemical potential difference @xmath22 .",
    "the isolated dot corresponds to ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 the ` noninteracting ' model below is taken to contain the interaction level shift @xmath25 of the bare level @xmath26 .",
    "the leads are described by a pair of @xmath1-wave bcs hamiltonians in the standard wide - band limit .",
    "we are interested in the @xmath27 case , and take the same real - valued gap parameter @xmath28 for both electrodes . using the nambu vector @xmath29 for electrons in lead @xmath30 , we thus have ( we put @xmath16 in intermediate steps ) @xmath31 with pauli matrices @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) in nambu ( keldysh ) space . using the nambu vector @xmath34 and @xmath35 for ( normal ) lead density of states @xmath36 , the lead - dot coupling is @xmath37 where the voltage @xmath4 enters via the time - dependent phase .",

    "accordingly , @xmath42 denotes a time taken on branch @xmath1 of the keldysh contour .",
    "it is convenient to use the fourier decomposition @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes nambu - keldysh indices defined by @xmath45 , and @xmath46 for @xmath47 within the fundamental domain @xmath48 $ ] . for fixed @xmath49 , the dyson equation for the full green s function @xmath50 ( the check notation refers to the keldysh - nambu structure ) ,",
    "@xmath51 then becomes a matrix equation suitable for numerical inversion . here",
    ", interaction effects are encoded in the self - energy @xmath52 .",

    "current conservation , @xmath62 , is fulfilled for all results below .",

    "the complete first - order self - energy is given by @xmath67 where we use the sum convention for @xmath68 .",
    "note that this self - energy is independent of @xmath69 , but still depends on the ` off - diagonal ' frequency index @xmath70 . in time",
    "representation , @xmath71 contributions come with phase factors @xmath72 and thus correspond to anomalous ( pairing ) correlations .",
    "the presence of the off - diagonal harmonics in the self - energy is a consequence of the coherent mar transport regime considered here .",
    "the role of coherence is particularly important for the interplay between mar processes and charging effects in a quantum dot with a relatively strong coupling to the leads .",
    "let us at that stage briefly compare the first - order self - consistent approach based on eqs .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ self1 ] ) to the mean - field approximation of ref .  .",
    "the latter effectively considers only the time averaged components of the self - energy ( [ self1 ] ) corresponding to the two first terms of eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , thereby discarding all harmonics with @xmath71 and exchange terms in eq .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting self - energy contributions taken into account in ref .   correspond to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the scalar constants @xmath75 can be written as @xmath76 where the trace is over both nambu and keldysh spaces . under this approximation , there is no interaction effect on the current @xmath77 below some critical value @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , nontrivial stable solutions @xmath79 for the self - consistency equation ( [ zaikin1 ] ) exist only for @xmath80,@xcite where @xmath78 depends on @xmath81 and @xmath2 .",
    "the symmetry - broken phase with @xmath82 corresponds to a spin - polarized dot , and one then finds a coulomb blockade suppression of the current.@xcite however , for normal leads , serious problems with spin - polarized out - of - equilibrium mean - field solutions for the anderson dot have been identified recently,@xcite and those arguments also apply to the superconducting case .",
    "a typical value is @xmath83 for @xmath84 , and we shall always limit ourselves to @xmath85 where no such problems arise . in our calculations ,",
    "the actual value of @xmath78 follows from the numerical solution of the self - consistency problem , and we can thereby ensure that no spin - polarized solutions are present .",
    "in contrast to the mean - field scheme of ref .",
    ", however , the full first - order self - consistent approach generates sizeable interaction corrections even for small @xmath5 , see sec .",
    "these corrections are not just a matter of numerical accuracy but reflect the importance of on - dot pairing terms .      to go beyond the self - consistent first - order approximation given by eq .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) , we have to evaluate the second - order diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) . due to the large numerical effort in evaluating this diagram ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a non - selfconsistent scheme at this point , i.e. , we use the solution @xmath50 of the first - order problem to evaluate @xmath86 .",
    "as is well known,@xcite under such a scheme current conservation is only ensured for the particle - hole symmetric case , @xmath87 , see also ref .  .",
    "we therefore show second - order results only for @xmath87 .",
    "the second - order nambu - keldysh self - energy reads in time representation ( sum convention ) @xmath88 to avoid numerically expensive frequency convolutions , it is convenient to first compute the green s function in time representation according to eq .",

    "[ f1](b ) represents only a part of all possible second - order contributions .",
    "the rest is given by the time - local piece @xmath89 which has already been taken into account by our self - consistent first - order solution .",
    "the numerical implementation of the above perturbative approach is straightforward . to evaluate the current @xmath77 from eq .",
    "( [ dc_current ] ) , we partition the frequency summations into windows of width @xmath4 , and impose a bandwidth cutoff @xmath90 , such that @xmath91 . in our calculations",
    ", we use @xmath92 , but the precise choice is not critical . we then discretize the fundamental frequency domain @xmath93 with a step - size @xmath94 , and use a fast fourier transform routine to switch between time and frequency representations .",
    "( the efficient evaluation of the second - order self - energy requires to employ the time representation , while the dyson equation needs the frequency representation . )",
    "typically , we found @xmath95 sufficient for convergence .",
    "the matrix inversion in eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) is then performed for each @xmath96 separately , involving matrix dimensions of the order of @xmath97 .",
    "we refer to ref .   for further details of the numerical implementation in the related case of a phonon - mediated interaction .    in a first step ,",
    "we solve the first - order self - consistent problem posed by eqs .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) , ( [ g0 ] ) and ( [ self1 ] ) .",
    "this solution proceeds iteratively , where the stability or instability of the solution for @xmath50 is checked carefully by probing small deviations around it .",
    "the iterative solution can in fact be carried out with very modest computational effort , and quickly converges to a unique solution ( as long as @xmath85 ) .",
    "in a second step , we then use this converged first - order green s function to evaluate @xmath86 according to eq .",
    "( [ self2 ] ) , and to finally compute the current from eq .",
    "( [ dc_current ] ) .",
    "the second - order calculation is quite time - consuming for low bias voltage , where many mar orders need to be taken into account , and we therefore restricted our calculations to @xmath98 .",

    "we have also reproduced the respective results of ref .   when implementing their approximations .",
    "as additional check , green s function sum rules , such as @xmath100 = 0 $ ] at coinciding times , have been verified .",
    "next we discuss numerical results obtained under the perturbative approach described in sec .",
    "all results are for @xmath101 , and unless noted otherwise , we put @xmath102 which is sufficiently small to ensure @xmath85 for all investigated @xmath103 and @xmath12 but large enough to produce significant interaction corrections to the @xmath6 characteristics .",
    "we will focus on the most interesting subgap regime , @xmath7 .",
    "the excess current @xmath104 $ ] has also been computed .",
    "the interaction contribution @xmath105 to this quantity turns out to be generally small , similar to what is found for the case of phonon - mediated interactions.@xcite remarkably , this interaction correction is positive for @xmath106 , pointing towards a current enhancement .",
    "this trend is quite generic and discussed next .",
    "let us start by showing results obtained from the first - order self - consistent scheme ( i.e. , without the second - order self - energy ) . in that case , by virtue of self - consistency",
    ", we have the freedom to vary @xmath107 without spoiling current conservation.@xcite representative numerical results for the voltage - dependent interaction correction to the current , @xmath108 , are shown for @xmath109 in fig .  [ f2 ] .",
    "for all results shown here , we have @xmath85 , and the approach of ref .   would not yield any interaction correction .",
    "however , we find significant interaction effects for @xmath85 within the full first - order self - consistent approach .",
    "these effects are due to the time - dependent ( @xmath71 ) parts of the self - energy ( [ self1 ] ) , which contain pairing order parameters on the dot .",
    "for instance , at the symmetric point @xmath87 , we find by perturbation theory in @xmath5 that @xmath110 , but the complex - valued @xmath111 pairing term @xmath112 stays finite .",
    "this @xmath47-independent off - diagonal nambu component of the self - energy , absent in the normal ( @xmath13 ) case , describes the effect of interactions on the proximity - induced pairing correlation on the dot . at the mean - field level , @xmath113 is dominant for large @xmath5 , while terms like @xmath114 dominate for small @xmath5 .",
    "similar contributions with @xmath115 exist and are kept in our self - consistent first - order calculations , but they turn out to be significantly smaller .",
    "quite remarkably , we find @xmath116 for most voltages and/or dot level energies @xmath107 , pointing to an _ enhancement of the mar - mediated current by repulsive interactions_. we have persistently found this unexpected feature throughout the parameter regime @xmath15 , also when including the second - order self - energy , see below . a similar ( but weaker )",
    "enhancement can be found analytically for the critical josephson current of this system in equilibrium , see appendix .",
    "the current enhancement is reminiscent yet different from the ` antiblockade ' behavior due to dynamical coulomb blockade effects on mar transport discussed in ref .  .",
    "it is also consistent with the crossover from current enhancement to decrease with growing @xmath117 for phonon - mediated interactions and normal - conducting leads.@xcite    to illustrate the role of the second - order contribution for @xmath102 , we now focus on the symmetric case @xmath87 , first taking again @xmath109 .",
    "the results of the first- and second - order calculations are compared in fig .",
    "notice that the second - order correction , which is the leading time - nonlocal term in the perturbative expansion , becomes more and more important when lowering the voltage . in agreement with the conclusion drawn from the first - order self - consistent calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , a clear enhancement of the current by interactions can be observed for a broad range of voltages .",
    "this enhancement is especially pronounced for voltages slightly below the odd mar peaks located at @xmath118 .",
    "as indicated by our results for larger @xmath117 , see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] for the case @xmath119 , the interaction - induced enhancement of the current is restricted to small @xmath12 . for larger @xmath12 , the current instead",
    "is weakly suppressed by interactions . the same pronounced mar peak structure as in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] can be observed in the pair order parameter @xmath114 defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) , whose absolute value is shown in fig .",
    "the fact that the characteristic mar features still appear at @xmath120 for the interacting case indicates that , at least for small @xmath5 , the number of andreev reflections is not affected by the coulomb interaction .",
    "this is in contrast to the inelastic mar picture for phonon - mediated interactions , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "moreover , our results indicate that the andreev quasiresonances@xcite are not shifted away from the gap subharmonics .",
    "as follows from our numerical analysis , the magnitude of the difference current is mainly determined by the first harmonics of interaction - mediated pairing , eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) , and can be roughly approximated as @xmath121 this can be seen , for instance , from comparison of the curves in figs .",
    "[ f5 ] and [ f2 ] ( for @xmath122 ) . a similar expression for the difference current , eq .",
    "( [ estimation ] ) , is also obtained from a simple fermi golden rule calculation , by analyzing the dynamics of andreev ( subgap ) states at very low voltages , @xmath123 .",
    "the corresponding correction to the transition rate from andreev states into the continuum is determined by the imaginary part of the andreev state self - energy @xmath124 , while the total escape probability leading to the difference current is given by an expression similar to eq .",
    "( 3 ) in ref .  .",
    "the above results also suggest that as a function of the ratio @xmath12 , there should be a crossover from enhancement to suppression of the current around @xmath125 .",
    "this is what we get when fixing the voltage and changing @xmath12 . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , we have chosen @xmath126 , where the self - consistent first - order approximation gives the main contribution , and plotted @xmath127 either for fixed @xmath102 ( solid line ) , or for fixed @xmath128 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the two curves both cross zero approximately at the same value , @xmath129 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a theory exploring the effect of weak interactions on superconducting transport through a quantum dot .",
    "employing second - order perturbation theory , valid for @xmath130 , we find an unexpected enhancement of the subgap current against its noninteracting value when the hybridization @xmath117 is smaller than the bcs gap parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the perturbation theory scheme pursued in this paper offers controlled results in one corner of the parameter regime , and in contrast to previous mean - field theories , we predict significant interaction corrections even for weak interactions .",
    "we thank a. levy yeyati , t. martin , and v. shumeiko for discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the eu hyswitch and instans networks .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly show that the interaction - induced current enhancement found in the @xmath6 curves for @xmath15 discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] also appears in the equilibrium josephson current - phase relation ( where @xmath131 is the phase difference across the dot ) for the same model .",
    "we consider the corresponding first - order self - consistent theory in equilibrium , for simplicity at @xmath87 only . for small @xmath5 , no polarization is present , @xmath132 , and only the proximity - induced mean - field parameter @xmath133 gives an effect . assuming real - valued @xmath114 , the @xmath101 self - consistency equation reads @xmath134 where @xmath135 the josephson current is then given as @xmath136 the presence of @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ jos ] ) generally causes two counteracting effects : there is a decrease of @xmath137 due to the numerator , but an increase due to the appearance of @xmath114 in the denominator . which of these is more important can only be clarified by detailed calculation .",

    "the interaction current to the josephson current for @xmath150 turns out to be positive , albeit numerically small . using eq .",
    "( [ azx ] ) we find @xmath151 we believe that this effect is related to the enhancement of the current at finite bias @xmath4 in the regime @xmath152 discussed in sec .",

    "( [ selfa ] ) is solved by @xmath154 , and the lowest - order interaction correction to the josephson current is @xmath155 with @xmath156 . due to the large @xmath157 factor appearing now in @xmath114 , the josephson current will in general be decreased by interactions for @xmath153 .",
    "we therefore find the same qualitative picture as for the nonequilibrium current in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] : the equilibrium josephson current can also be slightly increased by weak repulsive interactions for weak hybridization , @xmath141 , but is decreased in the opposite limit .",
