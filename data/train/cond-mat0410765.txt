    "the energy of the tightly bound three - body state was found to diverge in the hypothetical limit of a zero range binary potential .",
    "thomas discoveries were later generalised by efimov @xcite , predicting that the number of bound states of three identical bosons increases beyond all limits when the pairwise attraction between the particles is weakened in such a way that the only two - body bound state ceases to exist .",
    "such an excited three - body energy state that appears under weakening of the attractive pairwise interaction is called an efimov state .",
