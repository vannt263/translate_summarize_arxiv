    "photometric variation of a planet will enable us to estimate the rotation period @xcite and the obliquity @xcite in the near future .",
    "however these methods are applicable only for a planet having significant inhomogeneous surface , such as coexistence of ocean and lands or clouds , and also require a long - term observation with a sophisticated instrument of direct imaging .    recently _",
    "planetary _ radial velocity ( prv ) of the non - transiting planet , @xmath1 botis b has been measured with the aid of the carbon monoxide absorption in the thermal dayside spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected the change in the radial component of the planet s orbital motion and obtained the semiamplitude of the prv , @xmath2 km / s . combining the _ stellar _ radial velocimetry with it",
    ", they evaluated the orbital inclination and mass of @xmath1 botis b. though the prv curve is primarily dictated by the planet s orbital motion , the planetary spin also has possible effect on the prv in the dayside spectrum .",
    "gas giants in the solar system have considerable spin velocity at equator , 12 km / s for jupiter and 10 km / s for saturn . even for most hot jupiters which are likely to be in a synchronous orbit ,",
    "are expected to have non negligible spin velocity driven by their rapid orbital motion .",
    "for instance , wasp 19b will have @xmath3 km / s of the spin velocity at equator if it is tidally locked .",
    "the aim of the paper is to develop the method to derive the _ planetary _ spin - orbit alignment and the spin velocity from time series analysis of the prv .",
    "this concept can be explained by an analogy to the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "the rm effect is an anomaly of _ stellar _ radial velocity ( srv ) caused by sequent occultation of a rotating stellar disk by a transiting planet , and is used to measure the projected angle of the orbital axis and the _ stellar _ spin axis @xcite . likewise ,",
    "non - uniform emission from a planet , which is generally stronger near the sub - stellar direction , induces an anomaly in a time series of the prv . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate how the planetary spin affects the prv assuming a simple solid rotation of a planet and derive an analytic formula of the prv anomaly with simple intensity distribution models .",
    "we divide the prv into the radial velocity components of the planetary center system @xmath4 and the planetary spin @xmath5 , @xmath6 on the assumption of a circular orbit for simplicity , the prv by the orbital motion is expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is semiamplitude of the radial velocity by the orbital motion and @xmath9 is the orbital phase .",
    "we define the phase angle between the line of sight and star - planet direction @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are unit vectors from the planetary center to the star and the observer and @xmath14 is the orbital inclination ( figure [ fig : geo ] a ) .",
    "since the observed absorption consists of ensemble of a doppler - shifted line from each position on planetary surface , @xmath5 depends on the distribution of absorption lines on the surface .",
    "we use the intensity distribution instead of the distribution of absorption lines assuming the uniform distribution of molecules .",
    "@xcite showed that the intensity - weighted velocity is in agreement with the doppler shift , @xmath15 on the assumption that the frequency shift is much smaller than the line frequency ( eq . [ 20 ] in their paper ) .",
    "though the precise value measured by real observation will depends on details of methods and instruments , the aim of the paper is to qualitatively understand the behavior of @xmath5 .",
    "hence we regard the intensity - weighted velocity , @xmath16 as the prv of the spin , @xmath5 , where the @xmath17 is the phase function ( total intensity of emission ) , @xmath18 is the intensity distribution normalized so that @xmath19 is unity , @xmath20 is the radial velocity of a facet on surface measured on the planetary center system , and @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geo]a ) .",
    "a naive expectation is that @xmath18 has higher value at the dayside hemisphere than that at the nightside hemisphere ( fig [ fig : geo ] b and c ) .",
    "this is absolutely the case for the scattered light .",
    "it is also likely to be the case for thermal emission on the assumptions that the energy injection is mainly attributed to incident light from the host star .    in this paper , we regard a planet as a solid rotator and no precession , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the projected rotation angle between the spin axis and the stellar direction on celestial plane and the projected orbital phase angle @xmath24 is expressed as @xmath25 the maximum radial velocity of the solid rotator @xmath26 represents the strength of the spin , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the spin inclination .",
    "thus the degeneracy between @xmath29 and @xmath30 is inevitable for a solid rotator .",
    "the planetary obliquity @xmath31 is expressed as , @xmath32 where we introduce the planetary spin orbit misalignment @xmath0 , defined by the projected angle between the spin axis and the orbital axis on the celestial plane .",
    "figure [ fig : geo ] d displays a schematic picture of these angles . though @xmath28 is difficult to know directly , if knowing @xmath33 from the prv time series analysis , one can constrain the obliquity @xmath31 for a given @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig : geo ] e shows the possible region of @xmath31 for given @xmath33 , @xmath34 for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 .     as a function of @xmath9 .",

    ", one can interpret that @xmath47 represents the inhomogeneous pattern of the planetary surface .",
    "the @xmath48 term is due to apparent change of dayside along orbit and does not depend on the intensity distribution . as increasing @xmath14 ,",
    "the deviation by this term from the cosine curve of the orbital motion becomes stronger as shown in figure [ fig : geobehave ] a.",
    "considering two specific models of the intensity distribution , the instant re - radiation ( irr ) model and the dayside re - distribution ( dr ) model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we derive an analytic expression of the spin effect .",
    "the irr model assumes the input energy from a host star is instantly and isotopically emitted from the planetary surface .",
    "the isotropic reflection for the scattered light or no redistribution of energy around surface for the thermal emission satisfies this assumption .",
    "the intensity distribution of the irr model is expressed as , @xmath49 and the phase function @xmath50 where @xmath51 . using equation ( [ eq : falpha ] ) , we obtain @xmath52}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dr model assumes rapid energy redistribution on the dayside .",

    "substituting @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) into equation ( [ eq : weightedsym ] ) , we obtain the analytic expression of @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig : vrrot ] ( left ) shows @xmath58 for different @xmath33 and @xmath14 .",
    "one can see characteristic features of the prv depending on @xmath33 and @xmath14 . by fitting this anomaly , we can estimate @xmath33 and @xmath26 as will be demonstrated in next section .",
    "the difference of @xmath58 between these models is not significant .        for the exact edge - on orbit , equation ( [ eq : weightedsym ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath59 where a positive sign is for @xmath60 and negative for @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : transit_v ] ) indicates that the phase information of the term @xmath63 disappears except for its sign in the edge on limit .",
    "however one can know whether the spin is prograde or retrograde against the orbit .",
    "while we have considered the line shift so far , the spin rotation also induces the line broadening .",
    "we simply estimate the doppler broadening by considering the variance , @xmath64 where the definition of @xmath65 is same as that in equation ( [ eq : weighted ] ) .",
    "the right panels in figure [ fig : vrrot ] show @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "typical broadening width is @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath9-dependence is smaller than that of the line shift .",
    "the dependence of the emission models on @xmath66 is not significant .",
    "if using extremely high dispersion spectroscopy ( for instance , @xmath70 for @xmath71 km / s ) , one may derive this characteristic feature of the broadening variation .",
    "we demonstrate the spin effect by mocking the prv time series .",
    "figure [ fig : examock ] shows the mock prv curves with the irr model and its fitting curves .",
    "we set @xmath72 km / s precision , roughly corresponding to the accuracy obtained when lines are barely detected and resolved with @xmath73 , though it can be improved by increasing sensitivity and the number of lines .",
    "the top panels in figure [ fig : examock ] assumes a non - transiting system with @xmath74 , @xmath75 km / s , @xmath71 km / s , and @xmath76 ( left ; case a ) or @xmath68 ( right ; case b ) .",
    "we take 100 data points and avoid the @xmath77 range around the inferior conjunction ( ic ) since the planetary signal in this range declines below 7 % ( 20 % ) of the maximum value at @xmath78 for the irr ( dr ) model ( see figure 2bc red lines ) .",
    "we use a gaussian prior for the stellar mass with typical 5 % uncertainty and simultaneously fit the stellar mass , @xmath14 , @xmath33 , and @xmath26 using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm .",
    "the estimated inclination is well constrained @xmath79 since it is almost determined by the whole amplitude .",
    "the spin effect can be detected above 3 @xmath80 for these cases ; @xmath81 km / s with @xmath82 ( case a ) and @xmath83 km / s with @xmath84 ( case b ) .    though we have assumed an exact circular orbit so far , uncertainty of small eccentricity",
    ", @xmath85 can be a possible source of systematics . for @xmath86",
    ", one can express the velocity modulation due to @xmath85 as , @xmath87 , \\label{eq : approx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the argument of periastron .",
    "the modulation has the amplitude of @xmath89 and double frequency .",
    "we perform the mcmc leaving @xmath85 and @xmath88 as fitting parameters with equations ( [ eq : weightedsym ] ) and ( [ eq : approx ] ) . assuming a typical constraint of @xmath90",
    ", we obtain slightly worse constraints , @xmath91 km / s and @xmath92 for the case a. for the case b , the eccentricity uncertainty makes the spin effect to be unconstrained ( 1 @xmath80 detection level of @xmath26 ) due to the correlation between @xmath85 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath93 is marginal to detect the spin effect since the uncertainty of the modulation is comparable to the amplitude of the spin velocity , that is , @xmath94 . if assuming @xmath95 , which satisfies @xmath96 , we obtain @xmath97 km / s and @xmath98 even for the case b. as shown in the top left panel , @xmath46 for the case b is resemble to the eccentricity modulation ( eq . [ [ eq : approx ] ] ) in its curve .",
    "therefore the case b is more sensitive to the @xmath85 uncertainty than the case a. a more stringent constraint of @xmath85 than @xmath99 is important to detect the spin effect .    for the time being , a realistic target of the prv measurement will be confined to hot jupiters .",
    "we also consider the application of the precise prv measurement to hot jupiters .",
    "orbital period of hot jupiters is generally short ( @xmath100 a few days , typically ) . in a synchronous orbit",
    ", the rotation period equals to the orbital period .",
    "contribution of the orbital motion to @xmath46 is @xmath101 km / s for typical hot jupiters and reaches @xmath102 km / s for the extreme case , wasp 19b ( @xmath103 day and @xmath104 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we create the mock prv of a tidally locked transiting planet with parameters of wasp 19b ( @xmath105 km / s and @xmath106 ) . since @xmath14 is known for the transiting planet , we assume 5 % uncertainty of the stellar mass again .",
    "we fit the prv curve avoiding the range @xmath107 around transit , in which the planetary signal declines below 5 % ( irr ) and 15 % ( dr ) of the maximum .",
    "we also take the eccentricity uncertainty into consideration by adopting @xmath108 and @xmath109 for input . since current uncertainty of wasp 19 b",
    "is @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xcite , we assume a gaussian prior with @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we obtain a marginal detection of the spin , @xmath114 km / s and @xmath115 .",
    "the fitting with more stringent constraints @xmath116 and @xmath117 provides @xmath118 km / s and @xmath119 .",
    "the bottom left panel shows the mock prv and its fitting results for the latter .",
    "most hot jupiters are likely to be in a synchronous orbit with @xmath120 ( therefore @xmath121 ) due to tidal force .",
    "however , this expectation has never been proved observationally . in particular , the assumption of the tidal lock is not obvious for a planet in a highly eccentric orbit such as hd 80606 b ( @xmath122 ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally we consider an extreme planet with a rapid retrograde spin @xmath123 and @xmath124 km / s .",
    "we note that _ retrograde _ here means the retrograde rotation of the _ planetary _ spin ( not the stellar spin ) against the orbital revolution , like venus .",
    "performing the same fitting process as the tidally locked case ( with @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) , we obtain @xmath127 km / s and @xmath128 with a characteristic feature of the residual as shown in the bottom right panel .    in this section",
    ", we excluded the light curve around the ic where the signal is weaker as is clear from @xmath40 in figure [ fig : geobehave ] .",
    "as shown in the bottom subpanels of figure [ fig : examock ] , most characteristic features appear around the ic though it depends on @xmath14 ( see also figure [ fig : vrrot ] ) .",
    "this is one of main difficulties to detect the spin effect practically . though current detection of the prv is far away from the ic ( @xmath129 for * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , future detection in the outer range is of importance to detect the spin effect .",
    "in this paper , we have estimated the observable shift of the planetary absorption by substituting the intensity weighted radial velocity ( eq . [ [ eq : weighted ] ] ) .",
    "it is known that the cross - correlation method used in the rm effect has a few - 50% systematics of the amplitude of the velocity anomaly when using the intensity weight . moreover ,",
    "even two cross - correlation methods used in different instruments make @xmath130 30 % difference in the amplitude of the rm effect ( t. hirano in private communication ) . hence more sophisticated modeling adapted to the details of measurement will be needed to obtain precise estimates practically .",
    "@xcite found that the radial velocity anomaly obtained by the cross - correlation method is larger than that predicted by the intensity weight method and that the bias tends to be larger as increasing the spin velocity .",
    "it makes detection of the spin effect easier .",
    "detailed structures of planetary surface such as uneven molecular distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or winds may affect the prv in principle .",
    "the prv in transmission spectra @xcite might help to resolve a degeneracy between winds and spin ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we postpone these problems until a next paper .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown how the planet s rotation affects the prv in the dayside spectra of exoplanets .",
    "we found that the spin effect of the solid rotation on the prv is characterized by the projected angle between the orbital axis and the spin axis , @xmath33 .",
    "we also showed that the precise measurement of the prv enable us to constrain the planetary obliquity via @xmath33 and the spin period via @xmath26 .",
