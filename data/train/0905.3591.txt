    "modern fabrication technology allows for the growth of multilayer structures that are nearly perfect at the atomic level , namely with minimal roughness , employing a variety of transition metal oxides ( tmo ) . due to the simultaneous participation of several degrees of freedom in tmo ,",
    "it is expected that the artificial multilayer structures made of these materials will exhibit much richer physics than in conventional semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "indeed , recent studies have revealed some fascinating phenomena , such as the reconstruction of spin , charge , and orbital orders at the interface .",
    "@xcite many interesting properties have also been theoretically predicted using a variety of many - body techniques .",
    "@xcite    among the several ongoing efforts , there is a considerable interest in the analysis of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) heterostructures , where r = la , pr , ... refers to a trivalent rare - earth , and a = sr , ca , ... is a divalent alkaline element .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures , the bulk @xmath8 is in an a - type antiferromagnetic ( a - afm ) state , which is an insulator , whereas the bulk @xmath9 is in a g - type antiferromagnetic ( g - afm ) state , that is also an insulator . upon doping ,",
    "the alloy @xmath10 ( @xmath2 ) exhibits a variety of states depending on the doping concentration @xmath11 , which controls the charge density in the alloy .",
    "however , the heterostructure @xmath1 could potentially behave differently from its parent bulk compounds .",
    "for instance , the transfer of charge through the interface caused by the different fermi energies , and concomitant different electronic density concentrations , of the superlattice components causes a distribution of charge that it is not homogeneous along the growth direction .",
    "hence , several states may exist in different regions of the heterostructure .",
    "while far from the interface the behavior must be similar to the one in the bulk compounds , close to the interface it may occur that phases very different from those of the superlattice components may exist due to the charge leaking through the interfaces .",
    "for instance , in the short - period @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) superlattices the regime close to the interface exhibits ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic behavior , which is different from either @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite more interestingly , as the number of @xmath16 layers exceeds a critical value , the metallic behavior gives way to an insulating one , displaying a metal - to - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "this suggests that the electronic reconstruction at the interface has a crucial effect on the physical properties of the heterostructure.@xcite theoretically , considerable progress has been made in describing the ferromagnetism induced by this electronic reconstruction .",
    "@xcite a recent study by the authors  @xcite focused on the mit in the short - period @xmath13 superlattices . there",
    ", a fm metallic state with a dominant @xmath17 orbital order was found at the interface .",
    "the insulating behavior of the superlattice was explained as induced by anderson localization of this quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) fm state .",
    "note that limited by computing power , most theoretical efforts based on computer simulations concentrate on superlattices with a small number of @xmath16 layers .",
    "this is enough to understand the fm in the short - period superlattice , but may not be appropriate to study the properties of longer - period structures .",
    "another limitation is that most theoretical studies focus on the @xmath13 superlattice .",
    "the corresponding bulk compound @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is a wide bandwidth manganite .",
    "but not much is known about the interfacial state of the @xmath1 superlattice if @xmath2 is a narrow or intermediate bandwidth manganite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we use the two - orbital double - exchange model for manganites , which has been successfully applied to the study of bulk mn oxides ,  @xcite to the analysis of @xmath1 heterostructures .",
    "these heterostructures are assumed to be grown along the @xmath20 direction ( @xmath21 axis ) .",
    "we here also assume that the length of the heterostructure is long enough that the states at the two ends of the heterostructure resemble their bulk counterparts , i.e. , an a - afm at the rmo side and a g - afm at the amo side .",
    "this assumption allows us to focus on the only interface present in the heterostructure . by using a relaxation method introduced in the following section ,",
    "we can obtain the magnetic and electronic properties of the ground state of the heterostructure .",
    "different from previous efforts that concentrated on the fm tendency in short - period superlattices , we find that in the heterostructure considered in this paper the state stabilized at the interface depends on the bandwidth of the corresponding bulk compound @xmath2 at electronic density close to @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath2 is a narrow - to - intermediate bandwidth manganite , a state resembling the well - known ce - state of bulk manganites is found to be stabilized at the interface .",
    "hence our calculations suggest a ce - like interface state in the @xmath22 heterostructure .  @xcite",
    "but if @xmath2 is a wide bandwidth manganite , an a - afm state is found at the interface instead .",
    "this is consistent with recent experimental results on the @xmath23 superlattices .",
    "@xcite    in addition , it is important to remark that one of the main results of our study is the observation of states close to the interface that do @xmath24 have an analog in experimentally known bulk phase diagrams .",
    "these states arise as interpolations between , e.g. , the a - afm and ce - states that dominate in the bulk and interfaces , respectively . for instance , canting of the spins in the ce zigzag chains creates a novel `` canted ce state '' .",
    "also the relative spin angle between adjacent ce planes can be different from those observed in the bulk . and",
    "in some occasions , arrangements of spins and orbitals were identified that do not have a clear bulk analog in experiments .",

    "this model has been widely used before to study the properties of bulk manganites , and the following assumptions are also widely accepted : ( 1 ) the @xmath25 electrons are considered as localized and are described as classical spins with magnitude @xmath26 ; ( 2 ) the jahn - teller lattice distortions are also assumed to be classical ; ( 3 ) the hund coupling between the @xmath25 and @xmath27 electrons is assumed to be infinitely large so that the @xmath27 spin is always parallel to the localized @xmath25 spin at the same site . based on these assumptions , the hamiltonian that will be applied to the manganite heterostructure reads @xmath28 the first term of hamiltonian eq.(1 ) denotes the two - orbital double - exchange hopping term . @xmath29 and @xmath30 run over the two @xmath27 orbitals @xmath31 ( orbital @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( orbital @xmath34 ) of a mn ion .",

    ", we will assume that the hopping amplitudes are the same for electrons on both sides of the heterostructure .",
    "this may not be realistic given the possible mismatch of lattice constants between the two different compounds .",
    "however , since the superexchange coupling is more sensitive to the change of lattice constant than the hopping amplitudes themselves , as a first approximation we assume that the hopping constants keep the same value on both sides while the superexchange couplings may become layer dependent .",

    "the ground state is approached via a relaxation technique : the optimized configuration of the oxygen coordinates and the @xmath25 spins is determined by minimizing the total energy of the hamiltonian eq.([e.ham ] ) .",
    "this method is first applied to a @xmath61 lattice with periodic boundary conditions to estimate properties of the bulk compound on each side of the heterostructure . in this publication , we will focus on the interface between an a - afm and a g - afm .",
    "hence , we will adopt a set of parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 that gives a - afm and g - afm ground states at the limits of @xmath27 electron densities @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . the same set of parameters is then used to calculate the ground state of the heterostructure .",
    "the heterostructure is defined on a @xmath66 lattice ( see fig .  [ f.heterostruct ] ) , with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath67 plane ( @xmath68 plane ) and open boundary conditions along the @xmath51 direction ( @xmath21 axis ) .",

    "for each of these 256 possibilities , and a fixed set of couplings in the hamiltonian , an independent optimization of the classical variables was made , namely the energy was minimized by solving @xmath73 self - consistently using the broyden s method ,  @xcite where @xmath74 . at each step",
    "we keep the two end layers to be dominated by the a - afm and g - afm states , respectively .",

    "however , @xmath81 is both temperature and frequency dependent and for this reason an accurate estimation of @xmath29 is not well known . in this paper , the hamiltonian eq.([e.hcoul ] ) is studied over a broad range of @xmath81 values , @xmath82 , corresponding to @xmath83 .",

    "therefore , for the @xmath1 heterostructure , @xmath86 is fixed to @xmath87 at the a - afm side , and to @xmath88 at the other side to enforce the charge neutrality .",
    "equation  [ e.hcoul ] is solved at the mean - field level by introducing the coulomb potential @xmath89 we then find that the coulomb interaction in eq.([e.hcoul ] ) recovers the third term in eq.([e.ham ] ) . in practice ,",

    ", we will first analyze the magnetic phase diagram of the corresponding bulk material .",
    "on one hand , this allows us to determine the model parameters to be used for the calculation of heterostructures ; on the other hand , a better knowledge of the bulk phase diagram also helps in understanding the possible spin structures in the heterostructure .",
    "previous theoretical investigations  @xcite have shown that in the two - orbital model the bandwidth depends on the electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath63 and the superexchange coupling strength @xmath62 .",
    "the larger the @xmath63 and @xmath62 are , the narrower the bandwidth is . in fig .",
    "[ f.phdce ] the phase diagram of the two - orbital model for the bulk is shown at various electronic densities , using @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the phase diagram is obtained by comparing energies of several candidate states : a - afm , g - afm , c - afm , e - afm , ce - afm , and fm states on the @xmath61 lattice .",
    "note that there could exist even more exotic states in the phase diagram , such as the @xmath103 state previously proposed@xcite at @xmath104 if larger lattice sizes could be considered , and spiral states at @xmath64 when in the presence of spin frustration.@xcite however , as shown below our interest will be mainly in the a - afm state stabilized at electronic density @xmath64 , the ce and a - afm states at @xmath105 , and the g - afm state at @xmath65 , namely in regions where the @xmath106 and spiral states are not expected to be relevant . hence in the current study ,",
    "the @xmath106 and spirals states are not considered .",
    "the bulk phase diagram is very rich . at small superexchange couplings the ground state is fm in a broad density regime , as expected from the double - exchange mechanism . at larger superexchange coupling the system transitions , from low to high electronic densities , from g - afm , to c - afm ,",
    "to ce - afm , and finally to e - afm phases , respectively .",
    "close to @xmath105 the ce phase is stable over a wide range of @xmath62 values and has an alternate charge / orbital order ; whereas the g - afm phase at low @xmath55 has neither charge nor orbital order .",

    "@xcite hence , @xmath110 and @xmath101 will be used as couplings for calculations of the heterostructures to be discussed later in this section .",

    "the densities @xmath115 and @xmath116 converge to the expected values in the corresponding bulk materials .",
    "but charges are redistributed in the rest of the layers due to the long - range coulomb interactions .",
    "note that there exists a plateau at @xmath117 in the layers close to the interface . to understand this feature ,",
    "let us study the fourier transform of the local electronic density in each layer , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the number of sites in each layer .",
    "@xmath120 at @xmath121 displays a peak in the layers close to the interface , where the plateau in @xmath122 exists .",
    "this suggests the presence of a charge ordered phase with @xmath117 that is stabilized at the interface .",
    "such a charge ordered state is found to appear at the interface for all the @xmath29 values considered in our study .",
    "hence , we believe the existence of this state is an intrinsic property at the interface of the heterostructure , at least within the approximations used in our calculations .    to better understand the states that are located at or close to the interface , it is important to study how the spins are ordered in each layer of the heterostructure .",
    "we have observed that the spin order is not much sensitive to the value of @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite thus , here only the information for the optimized real - space spin patterns at @xmath113 is presented in fig .",
    "[ f.spnce ] . from this figure , it is clear that the layers close to the interface ( layers 3 , 4 , and 5 ) exhibit a ce - type spin order .",
    "it is well known that in bulk systems and narrow bandwidth manganites , the ce state is stabilized at electronic density @xmath123 and has a staggered charge order . moreover , our previous results in this section using a cubic cluster to mimic the bulk also unveiled a ce state at the same density .",
    "thus , the ce spin order found here further confirms that a charge / spin / orbital ordered state is stabilized at the interface .  @xcite    moving from the interface towards one end of the heterostructure ( layer 1 )",
    ", the ce state gives way to the fm order in each layer .",
    "but spins in two adjacent layers tend to be afm coupled , see layers 1 and 2 for instance .",
    "hence , the state at this end of the heterostructure has an a - afm tendency , resembling the spin order in the bulk .",
    "similarly , the state on the other side of the heterostructure turns from the ce state to a g - afm .",
    "the above described features are further confirmed by the layer - dependent spin structure factor @xmath124 shown in fig .",
    "[ f.structce ] .",
    "considering the degeneracy of states with ordering vector @xmath125 and @xmath126 , and with @xmath127 and @xmath128 , the ce order in layers 4 and 5 is nearly perfect .",
    "the previous analysis shows that the interface has ce characteristics .",
    "this may be considered as an `` obvious '' result , since in a heterostructure the interpolation between bulk materials with @xmath64 and @xmath65 likely will induce @xmath105 at the interface . in this simplistic conceptual framework ,",
    "the properties at the interface can be guessed , with good accuracy , merely from the bulk phase diagram .",
    "while this provides a reasonable starting point to analyze results and make predictions , further analysis actually suggests that this is not the end of the story , and some surprises can be unveiled at interfaces .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "consider for instance layer 3 . here",
    ", the average density is very close to 1 , yet the spins form zigzag chains as in the ce state of @xmath105 .",
    "the reason is that the spins at layer 3 are already being influenced by the robust ce state formed at layer 4 .",
    "thus , layer 3 is an exotic interpolation between the extremes case of the fm layers of the a - afm state in one end , and the ce state at the interface .",
    "moreover , note that the relative orientation between the spins of adjacent zigzag chains of layer 3 is not antiferromagnetic , as in a normal ce state , but it has some canting .",
    "this `` canted ce state '' is not present in bulk phase diagram , to our knowledge .",
    "note that a state called the  pseudo ce \" was previously discussed in experiments.@xcite considering just the individual layers , this state is the same as the usual ce , but the coupling between ce layers is ferromagnetic , instead of antiferromagnetic as in the standard ce state .",
    "thus , this pseudo ce state is not the same observed in our heterostructures .",
    "also note that a `` canted ce '' state similar to that described in the present investigations was reported in early neutron diffraction experiments@xcite of @xmath129 . however , further investigations for the same material@xcite suggested instead a mixed - phase interpretation of the results , with a mixture of af and fm phases , as opposed to a uniform canted ce state .",
    "thus , to our knowledge there is no evidence that the canted ce state exists in bulk form in real experiments , although more work is needed to fully address this matter .",
    "also we are not aware of previous theoretical investigations reporting such a canted ce state .",
    "@xcite    we also noticed that although the layers located right at the interface , i.e. layers 4 and 5 , exhibit almost a perfect ce order individually , the spins in the two layers are not perfectly afm aligned with respect to one another compared with what they should be in a bulk ce phase . in other words , the ce state in the bulk",
    "is well known for showing a `` stacking '' property along the direction perpendicular to the ce plane , which is respected here with regards to charge and orbital but not with respect to the afm relative order of the spins .",
    "in fact , in the layers @xmath130=4 and 5 of the heterostructure , the relative spin orientation is at approximately 90@xmath131 degrees , namely they are spin perpendicular to one another . once again , to our knowledge such an arrangement does not exist in the bulk . while it is obvious that the interplane spin deviation from afm order in a ce arrangement will increase the superexchange energy of the system , these spin arrangements also allow for charge transferring out - of - plane . in other words ,",
    "having an afm order in a link reduces the effective hopping amplitude to zero in a double - exchange context .",
    "but if the spin order is not afm , the kinetic energy in that link improves .",
    "then , the system can gain double exchange energy in the @xmath51 direction at the expense of superexchange if the ce stacking does not involve afm order .",
    "as a combined effect , the total energy appears to be lowered by this mechanism at the interfaces we studied here , while in the bulk it does not occur .",

    "let us focus on the optimized configuration with model parameters @xmath101 , @xmath137 , and @xmath113 .",
    "for other @xmath29 values the patterns look very similar . the orbital patterns in layers 1 and 2 , where the bulk - like a - afm phase is stabilized , display a clear staggered @xmath138 order .",
    "reciprocally , layers 7 and 8 do not show any orbital order due to the vanishing value of the electronic density .",
    "however , the orbital patterns close to the interface in the range of layers from 3 to 6 are complicated and they are presented in fig .",
    "[ f.orbce ] .",
    "here , we observe a transition from the staggered @xmath138 order to the orbital order of the ce state , and then to a ( very weak ) @xmath17 order in the g - afm state , with increasing layer index . in layer 3 ,",
    "the orbital pattern is very close to that expected of a @xmath64 state , but note that the orbital population along one of the orientations of the diagonals is not identical for each diagonal .",
    "this is caused by the influence of the ce state of the layer 4 .",
    "in addition , in the ce state of layers 4 and 5 , the  bridge \" sites , which have a higher electronic density than the rest , have staggered @xmath138 order , but the `` corner '' sites show a uniform @xmath4 order , which is larger than in the ce state stabilized in the bulk . in general , we find that in layers where either fm or ce spin order exist the @xmath27 electrons prefer to form an in - plane orbital order .",
    "this is because in these layers the two oxygens connected to a mn ion tend to shrink along the @xmath51 direction to minimize the energy of electron - phonon interactions by decreasing @xmath139 .",
    "but in the layers where there is a g - afm state , the oxygens will expand along the @xmath51 direction to partially compensate the shrinking effect along this direction in other layers .",

    "the features of the orbital arrangements are dominated by what we expect to find in @xmath64 a - afm , @xmath105 ce , and @xmath140 g - afm states .",

    "in the previous section , the physical properties of the @xmath99 and @xmath100 heterostructures were discussed .",

    "[ f.phdag](a ) , the a - afm phase at @xmath143 can not be stabilized near @xmath144 .",
    "this is because the a - afm phase only appears in a very narrow regime of the phase diagram in the two - orbital model if a cubic lattice symmetry is considered .",
    "@xcite this is compatible with the fact that the real compounds exhibiting the a - afm phase , such as @xmath14 , have an orthorhombic , instead of cubic , lattice symmetry , with the lattice constant along the @xmath21 axis smaller than those along the @xmath32 and @xmath34 axes .",
    "@xcite to better incorporate the lattice distortion found in the bulk parent compound , an inter - layer superexchange coupling larger than the intra - layer one should be used , i.e. @xmath145 .  @xcite the ratio @xmath146 is estimated  @xcite to be @xmath147 . using these numbers , the phase diagram for @xmath148 at @xmath143",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.phdag](b ) .",
    "the a - afm phase is now stabilized in a wider regime of the phase diagram , including @xmath144 .",
    "thus , tuning @xmath62 to @xmath149 , the system experiences transitions involving the g - c - a - fm - a phases with increasing electronic density @xmath55 , and this resembles properly the experimentally observed phases of wide - bandwidth manganites @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite    as for the @xmath1 heterostructure , the state on each side , far from the interface , must converge to its bulk phase . to obtain a stable a - afm phase in the bulk @xmath8",
    ", we use the couplings @xmath143 and @xmath150 on the @xmath8 side of the heterostructure . on the @xmath9 side , since the bulk @xmath9 still has the cubic lattice symmetry ,  @xcite we adopt @xmath143 and @xmath151 . at the interface , the lattice constants along the @xmath32 and @xmath34 axes will compress but those along the @xmath21 axis elongate to recover the cubic symmetry due to the strain effect .",
    "thus , we adopt the inter - layer superexchange coupling @xmath152 at the interface .",
    "-0.95 cm -0.5 cm    the averaged electrostatic potential and electronic densities in each layer at @xmath113 and @xmath153 are presented in fig .",
    "[ f.lcdg1.22 ] .",
    "these charge distributions are actually similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ f.lcdce ] .",
    "interestingly , there is also a plateau at @xmath123 indicating the existence of a fairly stable half - doped state near the interface .",
    "although there is no ce phase in the phase diagram of wide bandwidth manganites , we find instead that the a - afm phase can be stabilized at @xmath123 in the bulk limit .",
    "thus , the plateau at @xmath123 in fig .  [ f.lcdg1.22 ] suggests the state at the interface to be the a - afm state .",
    "this assumption is fully supported by the optimized real - space spin configuration results presented in figs .",
    "[ f.spng1.22a1.0 ] and [ f.spng1.22a0.2 ] : for both @xmath113 and @xmath153 , the a - afm phase spin arrangement is found in layers close to the interface .",
    "figures [ f.spng1.22a1.0 ] and [ f.spng1.22a0.2 ] indicate that the transition from the a - afm state at the interface to the g - afm state at one end of the heterostructure depends on the value of the screening parameter @xmath29 . at a large @xmath29 value , an interesting result is found . in this case , there is one layer ( layer 6 ) with an intermediate exotic state , that has no analog in the bulk experimental phase diagrams , to our knowledge .",
    "this state consists of alternate fm and afm stripes , indicating a local mixed phase tendency .",
    "note that we have carried out numerical studies on square clusters , @xmath143 , and @xmath154 , simulating bulk two dimensional systems , and in this case we do find a similar mixed af - fm state at electronic quarter - filling densities .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that this state may exist in bulk single - layer manganites at large hole doping as well . at small @xmath29 values , on the other hand",
    ", the transition is via introducing spin canting in several layers .",
    "we note that in real heterostructures , the mixed - phase tendencies and spin canting may coexist .",
    "let us consider now the orbital occupation near the interface . in fig .",
    "[ f.orbg1.22 ] the orbital pattern near the interface for @xmath143 , @xmath155 , and @xmath113 is presented .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the orbital pattern shows a clear transition from a staggered @xmath138 order at one end of the heterostructure to a uniform @xmath4 order at the interface , layers 4 and 5 , although the spin order is unchanged and fixed into an a - afm state .",
    "this is understandable , since we know in the bulk the a - afm exists both close to @xmath64 and close to @xmath105 . comparing with fig .",
    "[ f.lcdg1.22](a ) , we observe that the orbital order is tightly connected to the average electronic density of the layer : the @xmath138 order appears at @xmath144 , but the @xmath4 order is present at @xmath123 .",
    "such a uniform @xmath4 orbital order is also observed in the a - afm phase at @xmath123 in the bulk material .",
    "@xcite since the bulk a - afm phase at @xmath123 is metallic , the a - afm state at the interface of the heterostructure can be anticipated to be a two - dimensional metal .",
    "however , note that such a 2d metallic state could be unstable due to anderson localization introduced by the roughness and defects at the interface .",
    "hence , an insulating behavior is more likely to be observed in real materials .",
    "-0.8 cm -0.8 cm    in the exotic layer 6 exhibiting the mixed afm - fm tendency , the orbital pattern is complicated . according to fig .",
    "[ f.spng1.22a1.0 ] , there are majority spins ( black arrows in layer @xmath156 ) and minority spins ( red arrows ) .",
    "the minority spin sites correspond to @xmath17 order .",
    "the sites adjacent to the minority spin sites display alternating @xmath138 order , but the sites diagonal to the minority spin sites show a @xmath4 order . once again , we remark that such an exotic orbital order has not been observed experimentally in bulk materials to our knowledge , although it may be part of theoretical phase diagrams of models for two dimensional manganites in the bulk at large hole densities , and it is also conceivable that real single - layer manganites in the bulk may present also a similar phase .",
    "in this paper , the magnetic and electronic properties of the states near the interface of @xmath1 heterostructures were investigated using numerical optimization techniques on small clusters at zero temperature .",
    "the states stabilized at the interface are found to be similar to the states in the bulk compound at electronic density @xmath123 .",
    "this is easy to understand .",
    "let us consider the superlattice @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath157 where @xmath32 is the lattice constant along the @xmath51 direction , there must exist layers exhibiting properties of the bulk parent compounds @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in this case , the electronic density in the regime near the interface is not much sensitive to @xmath158 or @xmath159 , but is always close to @xmath3 if @xmath29 is about the same on both sides of the heterostructure .",
    "then , the regime close to the interface ( within @xmath160 in the @xmath51 direction ) can accommodate the state stabilized at @xmath123 in the bulk .",
    "for the case of a wide bandwidth manganite , a uniformly @xmath4 ordered a - afm phase is stabilized at the interface .",
    "hence we propose that this state should exist in the long - period @xmath161 superlattice where @xmath162 and @xmath55 are large enough such that there are bulk - like a - afm and g - afm insulating regimes far from the interface .",
    "it is quite reassuring that recent experiments on the @xmath163 superlattice at @xmath164 provided strong evidence for the existence of this orbital ordered a - afm phase .",
    "@xcite however , for short - period superlattices , the electronic density near the interface may deviate from @xmath3 , and also note that a well - defined bulk - like regime may not exist in these structures .",
    "hence the state stabilized at the interface may be different from the one in the long - period superlattice .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath165 superlattice with @xmath166 , the electronic density near the interface is always higher than @xmath3 ,  @xcite falling into the fm regime in the phase diagram of bulk @xmath19 .",
    "hence , it is natural to observe a metallic fm state stabilized at the interface .",
    "@xcite increasing the number of sr layers , bulk - like insulating regimes appear and the superlattice is driven through the mit to be an insulator .",
    "the electronic density at the interface is also reduced by increasing the number of sr layers . as shown in ref .",
    ", the state at the interface is still fm with a @xmath17 orbital order .",
    "however , further increasing the number of sr layers , the electronic density at the interface will approach @xmath3 . then",
    ", the state at the interface becomes an a - afm with a uniform @xmath4 orbital order as discussed above , and the properties of the heterostructure are dominated by bulk - like regimes .",
    "@xcite    when studying the wide bandwidth manganites , we have used @xmath145 . for consistency , the same superexchange coupling ratio should be also used for the calculation of narrow - to - intermediate bandwidth manganites .",
    "but the a - afm phase at @xmath64 is already stabilized in a cubic lattice for a large electron - phonon coupling .",
    "thus , changing the superexchange coupling ratio does not modify the phase diagram crucially .",
    "calculations have shown that setting @xmath145 also does not change the results for the heterostructures .",
    "hence , we have only presented here the results with @xmath167 in sec .",
    "[ s.lmm ] . in this case",
    ", interfaces dominated by ce - afm characteristics have been observed .",
    "it is very important to remark that several of our results have unveiled phases that are not observed in the bulk phase diagrams .",
    "they correspond to interesting modifications of the well - established bulk phases .",
    "for instance , for narrow bandwidth manganite heterostructures , the existence of exotic spin arrangements , such as `` canted ce '' and others , have been reported in our investigations . for wide bandwidth manganites ,",
    "unexpected mixtures of fm and af features were also identified .",
    "while our observations obtained on small clusters need to be confirmed by other many - body techniques , the present computational studies revealed the possibility of finding new phases at interfaces , that do not exist in the bulk .",
    "this is an exciting result that deserves further investigations .",
    "figure  [ f.heterostruct2 ] summarizes schematically our results .",
    "-0.5 cm    regarding size effects in our simulations , certainly it is possible that the actual spin , charge , and orbital patterns of the novel states may be more complicated than found in our present study that was limited to small systems .",
    "however , note that in the heterostructures discussed here the @xmath64 a - afm on one side , the @xmath105 ce or a - afm at the interface , and the @xmath65 g - afm on the other side are very robust and likely will be present in real heterostructures . with these states ( with different layer electronic density ) anchored somewhere in the structure , then it is very reasonable to expect magnetic states @xmath168 between them , that will have novel properties . in the bulk when the electronic concentration is the same in every layer of course it never happens that a magnetic layer must interpolate between others with different densities .",
    "thus , we are confident that novel magnetic states , of a form likely even more complex than unveiled here , would be present in manganite superstructures if simulations using larger clusters were possible .",
    "note that for bulk phase - separated manganites ,  @xcite involving a competition between states with different electronic densities , then the novel states discussed here could also appear at the interfaces between puddles of the competing phases as well .    in conclusion , we find that the properties of the @xmath1 heterostructure are closely , but not entirely , associated with the phase diagram of the bulk compound @xmath2 .",
    "we summarize our main results in fig .",
    "[ f.heterostruct2 ] . as one sees ,",
    "although a uniform state does not exist in the heterostructure due to the redistribution of the charges , as a first approximation the state near the interface can be  read \" from the phase diagram of the bulk compound @xmath2 at electronic density @xmath123 , i.e. , a ce state if @xmath2 is a narrow - to - intermediate bandwidth manganite , but an a - afm state with uniform @xmath4 orbital order if @xmath2 is a wide bandwidth manganite . however ,",
    "the intermediate states in between the interface and the bulk - like regimes are sensitive to both the model parameters and the length of the heterostructure . at least in our studies",
    ", it can be either a spin canted ce state or a state showing local fm - af mixed tendencies .",
    "we believe our results can be used to describe the ground state properties of the long - period @xmath169 superlattices as well .",
