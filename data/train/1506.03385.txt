    "partial differential equations ( pdes ) have been widely used to describe a variety of phenomena such as electrostatics , electrodynamics , fluid flow or quantum mechanics .",
    "traditionally , finite difference , finite element and boundary element methods are the mainstream numerical approaches to solve the pdes . recently , using the feynman - kac formula @xcite@xcite@xcite which connects solutions of differential equations of diffusion and heat flow and random processes of brownian motions , numerical methods based on random walks or monte carlo diffusions have been explored for solving parabolic and elliptic pdes @xcite@xcite .",
    "the feynman - kac formula represents the solutions of parabolic and elliptic pdes as the expectation functionals of stochastic processes ( specifically brownian motions ) , and conversely , the probabilistic properties of diffusion processes can be obtained through investigating related pdes characterized by corresponding generators @xcite .",
    "the formula involves the path integrals of the diffusion process starting from an arbitrarily prescribed location , and this enables us to find a local numerical solution without constructing space and time meshes as in traditional deterministic numerical methods mentioned above , which incur expensive costs in high dimensions . in many applications",
    "it is also of practical importance and necessity to seek a local solution of pdes at some interested points .",
    "if the sample paths of a diffusion process are simulated , then by computing the average of path integrals we can obtain approximations to the exact solutions of the pdes . for second order elliptic pdes with dirichlet and neumann boundaries ,",
    "the average of path integrals is reduced to the average of boundary integrals under certain measure where the detailed trajectories of the diffusion process have no effect on the averages except the hitting locations on the boundaries .",
    "simulations of diffusion paths can be done by random walks methods @xcite@xcite @xcite @xcite either on lattice or in continuum space . in some cases such as for the poisson equation ,",
    "the feynman - kac formula has a pathwise integral requiring the detailed trajectory of each path .",
    "moreover , one may need to adopt random walks on a discrete lattice in order to incorporate inhomogeneous source terms .",
    "as for the continuum space approach , the walk on spheres ( wos ) method is preferred where the path of diffusion process within the domain does not appear in the feynman - kac formula .",
    "for both approaches , the geometry of the boundaries need special care for accurate results @xcite . in our previous work on laplace equation with neumann boundary conditions",
    "@xcite , we proposed a numerical method to simulate the standard reflecting brownian motion ( srbm ) path using wos and obtained the boundary local time of the srbm . as a result",
    ", a local numerical solution of the pde is achieved by using the feynman - kac formula .",
    "other literatures @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite have also explored similar problems .",
    "especially , in @xcite schemes based on the wos , euler schemes and kinetic approximations are proposed to treat inhomogeneous neumann problems .",
    "it turns out that the pointwise resolution is much harder due to the choice of the truncation of time .",
    "however , the local time was not handled explicitly in @xcite . on the other hand , monte carlo simulations were discussed in @xcite where the positive part of the boundary needs to be identified first . in this paper , following @xcite we continue the use of srbm to solve robin boundary problems for the laplace operator , which has many applications in heat transfer and impedance tomograph .",
    "our goal again is to obtain a local approximation to the exact solution of the robin problem .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , the skorohod problem is introduced in section 2 , where both the concepts of standard reflecting brownian motion and boundary local time will be reviewed briefly .",
    "this lays the foundation for the underlying diffusion process of the robin boundary problem and the sampling of the diffusion paths .",
    "secondly , an overview of the feynamn - kac formula is given in section 3 .",
    "thirdly , the probabilistic representation of the solution for the robin boundary value problem proposed in @xcite@xcite is discussed in section 4 , and we will see the relation between the neumann and robin problems and gain a new perspective .",
    "section 5 presents the numerical approaches and test results .",
    "finally , conclusions and future work are given in section 6 .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is a domain with a @xmath1 boundary in @xmath2 .",
    "the generalized skorohod problem is stated as follows :    let @xmath3 , a continuous function from @xmath4 $ ] to @xmath2 .",
    "a pair @xmath5 is a solution to the skorohod equation @xmath6 if    1 .",
    "@xmath7 is continuous in @xmath8 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath9 is a nondecreasing function which increases only when @xmath10 , namely , @xmath11 3 .",
    "the skorohod equation holds : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the outward unit normal vector at @xmath14 .",
    "the skorohod problem was first studied in @xcite by a.v .",
    "skorohod in addressing the construction of paths for diffusion processes with boundaries , which results from the instantaneous reflection behavior of the processes at the boundaries .",
    "skorohod presented the result in one dimension in the form of an ito integral and hsu @xcite later extended the concept to @xmath15-dimensions ( @xmath16 ) .    in the simple case that @xmath17 , the solution to the skorohod problem uniquely exists and can be explicitly given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "in general , solvability of the skorohod problem is closely related to the smoothness of the domain @xmath0 . for higher dimensions ,",
    "the existence of ( @xmath20 ) is guranteed for @xmath1 domains while uniqueness can be acheived for a @xmath21 domain by assuming the convexity for the domain @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown by lions and sznitman @xcite that the constraints on @xmath0 can be relaxed to some locally convex properties .",
    "next we introduce the concept of srbm and boundary local time which play important roles in solving robin boundary problem by probabilistic approaches .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 is a standard brownian motion ( sbm ) starting at @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the solution to the skorohod problem @xmath6 , then @xmath25 will be the standard reflecting brownian motion ( srbm ) on @xmath0 starting at @xmath26 . because the transition probability density of the srbm satisfies the same parabolic differential equation as that by a bm , a sample path of the srbm",
    "can be simulated simply as that of  the bm within the domain .",
    "however , the zero neumann boundary condition for the density of srbm implies that the path be pushed back at the boundary along the inward normal direction whenever it attempts to cross the latter .",
    "the full construction of a srbm from a sbm can be found in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the boundary local time @xmath27 is not an independent process but associated with srbm @xmath25 and defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a strip region of width @xmath30 containing @xmath31 and @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath27 is called the local time of @xmath25 , a notion invented by p. lvy @xcite .",
    "this limit exists both in @xmath33 and @xmath34-@xmath35 . for any @xmath36 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath27 measures the amount of time that the standard reflecting brownian motion @xmath25 spends in a vanishing neighborhood of the boundary within the time period @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "besides , it is the unique continuous nondecreasing process that appears in the skorohod equation .",
    "an interesting part of ( @xmath38 ) is that the set @xmath39 has a zero lebesgue measure while the sojourn time of the set is nontrivial @xcite .",
    "this concept is not just a mathematical one but also has physical relevance in understanding the crossover exponent `` associated with renewal rate '' in modern renewal theory @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "an alternative explicit form of the local time was found , @xmath40 where the the right - hand side of ( [ eq7 ] ) is understood as the limit of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a partition of the interval @xmath37 $ ] and each @xmath43 is an element in @xmath44 .",
    "( @xmath38 ) and ( @xmath45 ) provide us different ways to approximate local time and in @xcite , it was found that ( @xmath38 ) yields better approximations in neumann problem than ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will also choose ( @xmath38 ) as the approach to estimate the local time here .",
    "the feynman - kac formula named after richard feynman and mark kac , establishes a link between pdes and stochastic processes .",
    "it first arose in the potential theory for schdinger equations , leading to a profound reformulation of the quantum mechanics by the means of path integrals . later",
    ", the formula also finds its applications in mathematical finance , where the probabilistic and the pde representations in derivative pricing are connected .",
    "let us first look at the dirichlet problems . given a domain @xmath46 with a boundary @xmath31 , @xmath47 where the operator @xmath48 and both the coefficients in @xmath49 and @xmath50 are lipschitz continuous and bounded .    the feynman - kac formula in this case @xcite represents the solution to ( @xmath51 ) in terms of an ito diffusion process @xmath52 @xmath53+e^{x}[\\phi(x_{\\tau_{d}})exp\\left\\ {   \\int_{0}^{\\tau_{d}% } c(x_{s})ds\\right\\ }   ] , \\label{eq13}%\\ ] ] with @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "is defined by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the brownian motion and @xmath58=\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha ( x)\\alpha^{t}(x),[b_{ij}]=b$ ] .",
    "the expectation @xmath59 is an integration with respect to a measure @xmath60 taken over all sample paths @xmath61 , thus ( @xmath62 ) is a representation of a solution of dirichlet problem in the form of functional integral .",
    "moreover , ( @xmath62 ) is obtained by killing process @xmath25 at a stopping time @xmath63 at which @xmath25 will be absorbed on the boundary .",
    "if @xmath64 , then the function @xmath50 can be interpreted as the killing rate @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that ( [ eq13 ] ) is equivalent to the formulation of weak solution and it is a classical solution as well if some smoothness conditions are satisfied .",
    "the feynman - kac formula above offers a method for solving certain pdes by simulating random paths of a stochastic process .",
    "conversely , an important class of expectations of random processes can be computed by deterministic methods . for the neumann boundary condition ,",
    "a similar formula was derived by hsu @xcite for the poisson equation , which is in the form of a functional integral based on the boundary local time introduced in section 2 . in this case , though the feynman - kac formula remains in a similar form , it should be understood as a path integral over the stochastic process @xmath27 associated with the standard reflecting brownian motion .",
    "we focus on robin boundary value problem for the time - independent schrdinger equation . @xmath65",
    "a generalization of the feynman - kac formula of section 3 in @xcite gives a probablistic solution of ( @xmath66 ) as follows , @xmath67 where @xmath25 is a srbm starting at @xmath26 .",

    "resembles the feyman - kac formula for the neumann problem with a modified @xmath78 @xcite , it indicates a connection between the robin and the neumann problems , namely , we may introduce @xmath79 then , the robin boundary problem ( @xmath66 ) can be viewed as a limiting case ( @xmath80 ) of neumann problems @xmath81",
    "in the present work , we only consider the case of the laplace equation where @xmath82 in ( @xmath83 ) . from",
    "( @xmath75 ) , @xmath84 where @xmath25 represents the standard reflecting brownian motion . for the sake of computer simulation",
    ", the time period is truncated into @xmath85 $ ] to produce an approximation for @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87    next we will give a general description on the realization of srbm paths and the calculation of the corresponding local time , as implemented in @xcite .",
    "a srbm path can be constructed by pulling back a bm path back onto the boundary whenever it runs out of the domain .",
    "specifically , a srbm path behaves exactly the same way as a bm which is simulated by the wos method .",
    "* method of wos for brownian paths    random walk on spheres ( wos ) method was first proposed by mller @xcite , which can solve the dirichlet problem for the laplace operator efficiently @xcite@xcite .    to illustrate the wos method for the dirichlet problem ( [ eq11 ] ) ,",
    "let us consider the laplace equation again where @xmath88 and @xmath89 in ( [ eq11 ] ) and the it diffusion is then simply the standard brownian motion with no drift .",
    "the solution to the laplace equation can be rewritten in terms of a measure @xmath90 defined on the boundary @xmath31 , @xmath91 where @xmath90 is the harmonic measure  defined by @xmath92 it can be shown easily that the harmonic measure is related to the green s function @xmath93 for the domain with a homogeneous boundary condition @xcite , i.e. , @xmath94 as follows @xmath95    if the starting point @xmath26 of a brownian motion is at the center of a ball , the probability of the bm exiting a portion of the boundary of the ball will be proportional to the portion s area . therefore ,",
    "sampling a brownian path by drawing balls within the domain can significantly reduce the path sampling time .",
    "to be specific , given a starting point @xmath26 inside the domain @xmath0 , we simply draw a ball of largest possible radius fully contained in @xmath0 and then the next location of the brownian path on the surface of the ball can be sampled , using a uniform distribution on the sphere , say at @xmath96 .",
    "treat @xmath96 as the new starting point , draw a second ball fully contained in @xmath0 , make a jump from @xmath96 to @xmath97 on the surface of the second ball as before .",
    "repeat this procedure until the path hits a absorption @xmath98-shell of the domain ( see fig .",
    "2 ) @xcite .",
    "when this happens , we assume that the path has hit the boundary @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) for an illustration ) .",
    "now we can define an estimator of ( [ eq13 ] ) with @xmath99 by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the number of brownian paths sampled and @xmath102 is the first hitting point of each path on the boundary .",
    "to speed up the wos process , maximum possible size of the sphere for each step would allow faster first hitting on the boundary .",
    "* wos and rbm    for the reflecting boundary , we will construct a strip region around the boundary ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and allow the process @xmath25 to move according to the law of bm continuously . before the path enters the strip region ,",
    "the radius of wos is chosen to be of a maximum possible size less than the distance to the boundary .",
    "once the particle is in the strip region , the radius of the wos  sphere is fixed at a constant @xmath103 ( or @xmath104 , see fig .",
    "3 ) . with this approach , according to the definition ( @xmath38 ) , the local time may be interpreted as @xmath105 which is @xmath106 given a prefixed constant @xmath103 in the strip region and @xmath107 be the cumulative steps that path stays within the @xmath30-region from the begining until time @xmath108 ( see remark below for definition ) .",
    "notice that only those steps where the path of @xmath25 remains in the @xmath30-region will contribute to @xmath107 because the srbm may lie out of the @xmath98-region at other steps .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite , where the same construction is applied for the neumann boundary value problem .",
    "one may refer to fig . 3 for an illustration of the behavior of path near the boundary .",
    "occupation time of srbm @xmath25 in the numerator of ( @xmath109 ) was calculated in terms of that of bm sampled by the walks on spheres .",
    "notice here that within the @xmath30-region , the radius of the wos may be @xmath103 or @xmath104 , which implies that the corresponding elapsed time of one step for local time could be @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",

    "we treat @xmath113 as a vector of entries of increasing value , the increment of each component of @xmath113 over the previous one after each step of wos will be 0 , 1 or 4 , corresponding to the scenarios that @xmath25 is out of the @xmath98-region , in the @xmath30-region while sampled on the sphere of a radius @xmath103 , or in the @xmath30-region while sampled on the sphere of a radius @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "robin boundaries represent a general form of an insulating boundary condition for convection - diffusion equations where @xmath50 stands for the positive diffusive coefficients . for our numerical test",
