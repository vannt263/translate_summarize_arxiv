    "a detailed understanding of such phenomena could open novel routes for designing materials for specific applications .",
    "time - periodic forcing of dendritic side - branching has already been realized via heating locally the dendrite tip by laser beam @xcite , or by exposing it to an oscillatory flow field @xcite .",

    "[ simfig2](d ) and [ pfrek](d ) of @xmath173 and 0.65 ] .",
    "an interesting observation is that far from the dendrite tip irregularities develop in the lengths of the side - branches , despite the even distance of their trunks .",
    "we observed an analogous phenomenon driven by the interaction with neighboring side - arms via thermal diffusion fields in long - time phase - field simulations @xcite .",
    "the effect of the _ forcing amplitude _ is shown in fig .",
    "[ expamp ] .",
    "pressure oscillations of amplitude of 1 bar efficiently regularize the side - branch formation . with increasing amplitude",
    "the phenomenon becomes more pronounced as predicted by the phase - field calculations . at the largest pressure amplitudes even the secondary side - branches correlate with the pressure oscillations",
    "[ see fig . [",
    "expamp](c ) ] .",
    "note again that the competition of neighboring side - branches leads to irregularities in their lengths .",
    "in analogy to pressure modulations , the periodic heating experiments on the 10 @xmath104 m thick liquid crystal cell also reveal regular side - branching [ see figs . [ elfrek](a)(c ) ] .",
    "the formation of side - branches correlates with the external forcing as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ elfrek](b ) , where the black lines denote the position of the tip at the centers of the heating pulses .",
    "the correlation is also evident from the power spectrum of the width of the dendrite measured 66.5 @xmath104 m behind the tip ( fig .",
    "[ expfouri ] ) . in full accord with the phase - field simulations for asymmetric square waves [ fig .",
    "[ simfig4](b ) ] , the power spectrum indicates the presence of modes that are either synchronous with the forcing frequency @xmath174 = 0.46 hz , or oscillate with doubled frequency ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "even a peak corresponding to the third harmonic ( @xmath176 ) may be identified , although with an amplitude that is close to the experimental uncertainty .",
    "remarkably , in the response to `` symmetric '' forcing @xmath139 , the @xmath177 mode is also present ( see the fourier - spectrum and the short side - arms of doubled frequency in fig .",
    "[ expdouble ] ) , although this frequency is absent from the forcing spectrum .",
    "this finding confirms the non - linear behavior revealed by phase - field simulations , that higher harmonics missing from the forcing spectrum are also excited [ see @xmath93 for sinusoidal forcing in fig .",
    "[ simfig4 ] ] .    increasing the _ heating amplitude or @xmath142 _ so that the period - averaged heating power reaches @xmath178 w/@xmath167 , the formation of the side - branches is suppressed [ see fig .",
    "[ elfrek](d ) ] , a phenomenon resembling that seen in the numerical simulations ( fig .",
    "[ simfig13 ] ) . further increase of the heating amplitude ( and power ) melts the dendrites back .    in line with our theoretical predictions",
    "( see fig .",
    "2 . of @xcite ) , a weak oscillation of the tip velocity has been observed that correlates with the forcing .",
    "however , its amplitude is just above the resolution of the present experimental setup .",
    "a remarkable feature of the `` regularized '' dendrites , not seen in the simulations , is a shift in the position of the side - branches on the two sides of the main tip [ see e.g. figs . [ elfrek](b ) and ( c ) ] . as a result , one can not use the symmetry parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 [ defined by eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ] for characterization of the pattern s regularity . for the same reason , the fourier spectra shown in figs .",
    "[ expfouri ] and [ expdouble ] have been evaluated from the half - width of the dendrite . despite the shift of the side - branches , the power spectra on the two sides",
    "are fairly similar .",
    "the shift in the position of the side - branches might be attributed to the asymmetry of the dendrite tip ( due to the angular dependence @xmath179 [ 35 ] ) , shown by a high resolution snapshot of the tip region of a dendrite grown freely at @xmath180 @xmath181c ( fig .",
    "[ tipshape ] ) .",
    "another remarkable feature is that the left side of the tip is faceted .",
    "the first observable surface undulation ( marked with arrow in fig . [ tipshape ] ) that evolves later into a side - arm appears on the opposite side .",
    "in contrast , the faceted side remains smooth up to the same distance behind the tip .",
    "finally , one should mention that the electric heating in liquid crystals may have side - effects that are not incorporated into our phase - field model .",
    "switching the electric field on , the orientation of the nematic director * n*@xmath107 changes from planar to homeotropic ( perpendicular to the bounding plates ) , an effect that influences the magnitude and anisotropy of the interfacial free energy , and may induce local flow in the sample",
    ". however , these side - effects are of minor importance , since they are present in full strength much below the electric field needed for regularization .",
    "in this section we confront our results with those on the dynamic response of dendritic growth to local forcing with fixed frequency as emerging from the microscopic solvability theory ( mst ) and experiment .",
    "it is appropriate to mention , that some features of the mst derivation prevent a quantitative comparison .",
    "for example , the mst calculations were performed for a 2d symmetric dendrite , while the anisotropy , the stability coefficient , and the pclet - number were assumed to be small ; conditions that are not met in our simulations and experiments .",
    "therefore , a qualitative comparison is only meaningful .",
    "an important further difference between previous work and ours is that we used non - local forcing , as opposed with the tip - localized forcing assumed in the mst .",
    "let us first recall some of the mst predictions on noise amplification ( based on the wentzel - kramers - brillouin approximation ) that have been tested by comparison with numerical simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite for fixed frequency perturbations localized at the tip .",
    "\\(i ) periodic forcing by a fixed frequency @xmath137 leads to surface oscillations of amplitude that increases exponentially with the distance from the dendrite tip up to a critical distance @xmath182 proportional with @xmath183 . for larger distances",
    "the amplitude decreases and eventually dies away .",
    "if , in turn , the distance from the tip is fixed and @xmath137 is varied , a peak is observed in the amplitude .",
    "\\(ii ) the localized wave packets behave differently ; they grow exponentially as they move to arbitrarily large distances from the tip , while the respective characteristic wave length increases .",
    "our simulations are in line with the previous mst and numerical predictions for tip - localized forcing in the following respects :    \\(a ) in the vicinity of the dendrite tip , the amplitude of the mode synchronous with forcing increases roughly exponentially with the distance @xmath150 from the tip .",
    "owing to the excessive computation time and memory needed , we were unable to study the decay of this mode in detail . nevertheless , as expected from the mst , at large frequencies [ fig .",
    "[ simfig2](f ) and [ simfig3](f ) ] the synchronous mode can only be recognized in the vicinity of the dendrite tip .",
    "another sign , that accords with the presence of a critical distance @xmath182 beyond which the excited mode decays , is a maximum observed in the amplitude @xmath145 of the second harmonic ( fig .",
    "[ simamp ] ) in simulations where the forcing spectrum contains @xmath143 with a significant amplitude .",
    "\\(b ) the amplitude @xmath92 measured at a fixed distance behind the dendrite tip shows a maximum as a function of the forcing frequency [ fig . [ simfig5](a ) ] .",
    "an interesting feature , revealed by our phase - field simulations , is that besides the synchronous mode , the fourier spectrum of the dendrite width contains the second and third harmonics with perceptible amplitudes .",
    "this finding is confirmed by our experiments .",
    "we believe that this is the first direct demonstration of such non - linear effects in connection with diffusional instability induced dendrite formation during a first - order phase transformation .",
    "it appears , that this non - linear behavior is not a peculiarity of spatially homogeneous forcing .",
    "although not mentioned in the original works , traces of higher harmonics seem to be present in the respective power spectra for local forcing as well @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning , furthermore , that a similar behavior has been observed in the case of anomalous saffman - taylor fingering @xcite , suggesting that the appearance of higher harmonic modes in response to periodic external forcing is a common feature of dendrite formation whether driven by diffusional or mechanical instabilities .    summarizing , in the present state of affairs it seems that the only specific feature of pattern formation under non - local forcing is a simultaneous triggering of side - branches ( of first , second , and higher orders ) on independent crystallites throughout the sample .",
    "our computer simulations and experiments demonstrated that the dendritic morphology can be regularized by non - local time - periodic forcing realized by modulated pressure and joule heating .",
    "these conditions lead to an oscillatory velocity of the dendrite tip , and yield side - branches at regular distances , provided that the frequency of the modulation is close to the `` natural '' frequency of free side - branch formation .",
    "the dynamic response of the system to such non - local forcing can be understood in general on the basis of previous theoretical and experimental results on tip - localized forcing .",
    "however , the non - linear effects , such as the appearance of higher harmonic modes , warrant further theoretical work .",
    "the pressure dependence of the @xmath184 phase transition temperature has been measured by a procedure similar to that described in @xcite . for different @xmath185",
    "a single @xmath106 monodomain has been kept at constant size by controlling the temperature for several hours ( until the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the system has approached ) .",
    "[ append1 ] shows the change of the phase transition temperature depending on the pressure .",
    "linear fit on the data gives a slope @xmath186 k / bar for the clapeyron coefficient .",
    "the clapeyron coefficient can be also calculated from the relation : @xmath187 where @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the phase transition temperature at atmospheric pressure , the molar volume change on transition and the molar latent heat of fusion , respectively . from the relevant material parameters of cch3 , namely @xmath191 k @xcite , @xmath192 ( molar mass ) , @xmath193 kg / m@xmath194 ( density at 80.6 @xmath181c @xcite ) , @xmath195 j / mol , @xmath196 @xmath197 , and @xmath198 1/k ( volumetric expansion coefficient in the nematic phase @xcite ) one obtains @xmath199 k / bar in excellent agreement with the experimental value .",
    "although this value is much larger than for metals , it is not unusual for liquid crystals .",
    "for example , @xmath37 0.03 k / bar has been reported for the nematic ",
    "crystal transition in paa , and @xmath37 0.1 k / bar for the nematic smectic transition in p - methoxybenzoic acid @xcite .",
    "comparable , or even larger coefficients have been measured on other organic substances such as camphene 0.214 k / atm , pivalic acid 0.0674 k / atm , and succinonitrile 0.0245 k / atm @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath201 , where @xmath202*r*@xmath1 is the phase - field , is akin to the structural order parameter emerging from the local gaussian approximation used in the density functional theory of freezing [ y. c. shen and d. w. oxtoby , j. chem .",
