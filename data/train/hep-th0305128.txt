    "construction of a manifestly supersymmetric and gauge invariant renormalization procedure is a nontrivial and in some cases not yet solved problem .",
    "certainly , it is preferrable to have a calculation scheme which preserves supersymmetry at any intermediate stage .",

    "it can be convenient to use non gauge invariant regularization .",
    "for example , one can regularize the theory by adding higher derivative term with ordinary derivatives , instead of the covariant ones for the yang - mills field which simplifies the calculations considerably .",
    "such regularization preserves supersymmetry , but breaks gauge invariance , which should be restored by a proper choice of a renormalization scheme .",
    "for example , in the framework of algebraic renormalization it is done by tuning finite counterterms to provide relevant slavnov - taylor identities ( sti ) for the renormalized green functions .",
    "this method was applied successfully to susy gauge theories in the papers @xcite , where the invariant renormalizability of @xmath0 non - abelian susy gauge models was proven in the framework of algebraic renormalization .",
    "however a practical implementation of the algebraic renormalization is rather cumbersome as the procedure requires a tuning of a large number of ( noninvariant ) counterterms .",
    "recently a new method of invariant renormalization was proposed @xcite , which provides automatically the renormalized green functions satisfying sti .",
    "this method was generalized to sypersymmetric electrodynamics in @xcite .",
    "however , in order to apply it to non - abelian supersymmetric theories it is necessary to solve some problems , caused by a more complicated structure of sti .",
