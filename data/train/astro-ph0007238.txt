    "the abundance ratio of atomic deuterium to hydrogen ( d / h ) in interstellar gas is widely regarded as an important tracer of galactic chemical evolution ( audouze & tinsley 1974 ; boesgaard & steigman 1985 ; tosi et al .",
    "1998 ) and a key discriminant of the cosmic baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath5 in big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn , walker et al . 1991 ) .",
    "a standard interpretation is that d should not be produced in significant quantities in astrophysical sites other than the big bang ( epstein , latimer , & schramm 1976 ) .",
    "the generally accepted viewpoint is that while d is produced primordially , its destruction takes place when some of the gas is cycled through stars .",
    "the uncertainties surrounding this process represent a stumbling block in arriving at the primordial value . for this reason ,",
    "a measurement of d / h is often regarded as a lower limit to the primordial ratio , and this may be translated into an upper limit to @xmath6 ( for bbn , larger d / h implies lower @xmath6 ) .",
    "rogerson & york ( 1973 ) made the first measurement of the atomic d / h abundance ratio in the interstellar medium ( ism ) on the line of sight toward @xmath7 cen .",
    "measurements with the  satellite toward an additional 14 stars ( @xmath8 pc ) found that d / h values cluster around @xmath9 , but with a dispersion that , in some cases , seemed to exceed the stated uncertainties ( see review by vidal - madjar & gry 1984 ) . while a simple interpretation of the data suggested that the d / h measurements revealed spatial variations , the reality of these differences has been difficult to substantiate due to concerns stemming from the somewhat inadequate resolution of   ( @xmath10 fwhm ) for this purpose .    using the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) and space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) ,",

    "questions remain , however .",

    "we described the in - flight performance of imaps during the 1996 mission .",
    "here we only summarize the instrument s principal characteristics .",
    "imaps is an objective - grating echelle spectrograph designed to record the far - uv spectrum of bright stars at high spectral resolution .",
    "the optical design consists of a wire grid collimator to reject off - axis light from stars other than the target , an echelle grating with a 63  blaze angle , and a parabolic cross disperser .",
    "the spectral format is imaged on a solid kbr photocathode , whose electrons are magnetically focussed on a windowless , back - illuminated ccd with a 320x256 pixel format . the nominal wavelength range of 9301150 ",

    "the gratings were coated with lif over aluminum , providing excellent throughput longward of 1000  .",

    "the spectral resolution in imaps spectra obtained during the 1996 flight was approximately @xmath29 , or @xmath30 .",
    "the telluric  lines ( e.g. 950.112 near  - see fig [ gvlylines ] ) have fwhm @xmath31 , but these lines are probably partly resolved in imaps spectra ( see jenkins et al .",

    "typically , we found s / n=1015 in the local continuum near the  and  interstellar features .",
    "the data reduction and analysis of the  and  spectra and the determination of the  column densities were identical to those described in 1  for the line of sight toward .",
    "imaps spectra were analyzed to determine the total  (  [ gveln(di ) ] and  [ zpupn(di ) ] ) .",
    "a large number of _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( ) high resolution  spectra were obtained from the national space science data center archive to determine the total  column density ( ) in  [ n(hi ) ] .",
    "we note that given that  @xmath34 on these sightlines and that d / h @xmath35 , the gas that gives rise to the  damping wings is the same gas responsible for the  and  features .    in  [ niprof ]",

    "the line of sight column density per unit velocity [ , see 1 ] for , defined by a range of   lines recorded in the imaps spectra , provided a velocity template for modelling the  profiles .",
    "the high s / n for the  lines helped to constrain the model profiles that gave an acceptable fit to the lower s / n  lines .",
    "this can prevent noise in the  profiles from giving arbitrarily large or small  at specific velocities .",
    "we did not decompose the velocity profiles of  or  into separate ( blended ) gaussian components  the d / h ratios determined here were based on total column densities for each sight line .    using the method outlined in 1",

    "the 2  line is located at @xmath39 in  and at @xmath40 in  on the  heliocentric velocity scale .",
    "the strength and shape of these features were computed from other transitions of the same species recorded at longer wavelengths ( and higher s / n ) in the imaps spectra of  and .",
    "the computed central residual intensities of these features are nearly identical for the two stars : 0.66 for 937.6 and 0.95 for 2 949.3 .",
    "the other potentially contaminating lines noted in table 1 of 1  can safely be ignored .",
    "the possible contamination of the  order by scattered light from an adjacent order that contains the strong absorption lines of the  954 multiplet was evaluated in the same manner as described in 1 .",
    "the  analysis found that any residual contamination of the spectrum in the vicinity of   by the pattern of saturated  features was @xmath41% of the continuum in both  and .",
    "amplitudes for this correction larger than @xmath42% caused unacceptably bad deviations in the bottom of the  profile .",
    "given the general noise characteristics of the  profiles , this is a negligible effect .",
    "for the case of , there is another potential contamination source .",
    "a companion star , @xmath43  vel , is located 42  to the southwest of .",
    "its light should be accepted along with that from , since imaps is an objective - grating spectrograph without an entrance slit to reject unwanted sources .",
    "( the grid collimator rejects light coming from more than 1  from the axis , however . )",
    "@xmath43  vel is 2.5 magnitudes fainter than  in @xmath44 and has a spectral classification of b1@xmath45iv ( hoffleit & jaschek , 1982 ) .",
    "even though @xmath43  vel is cooler than , its flux is not diminished much below the peak of the planck distribution at our wavelengths of interest , so we expect its intensity at a given wavelength to be not more than about a factor of 10 fainter than . fortunately , when the observations were taken the roll angle of the spacecraft about the optical axis of imaps ( governed by the position of the sun in the sky ) was such that the faint spectrum of @xmath43  vel was displaced along the cross dispersion direction toward the long - wavelength part of the format .",
    "as a consequence , any spectral segment in the spectrum of  had light superposed on it from shorter wavelengths in @xmath43  vel ( the separation was slightly less than the distance between 3 echelle orders ) .",
    "the rapid decline in the sensitivity of imaps toward shorter wavelengths thus amplified the factor of 10 disparity in relative fluxes at any given position on the format .",
    "therefore , the contamination of the  spectrum by light from @xmath43  vel is negligible . as a final note , on visual inspection we are unable to see any ghost - like spectrum of @xmath43  vel on top of the spectrum of .",
    "the lyman line profiles for  and  are shown in figures [ gvlylines ] and [ zplylines ] .",
    "these profiles have been corrected for  and 2  line absorption , as described above .",
    "the background levels near the  lines were determined from the broad , saturated cores of the adjacent  profiles . as explained in 1 , we compared resolution - degraded forms of the imaps profiles with those recorded by  to test the proposition that the cores of the  lines indeed represented the zero - intensity levels in the vicinity of the adjacent  features .",
    "this was done to check that we were not being misled by an effect from possible strong , broad wings extending away from the main peak in the instrumental profile of imaps .",
    "we concluded that indeed the cores of the  profiles provided very good estimates of the zero levels in the vicinity of the  lines .    the best answers for  and the deviations permitted by the data were evaluated by minimizing  ( see lampton , margon & bowyer 1976 and bevington & robinson 1992 for details ) when all of our unknown parameters were allowed to vary",
    "the ten free parameters for  are ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) the gas temperature @xmath46 , ( 3 - 8 ) the continuum slopes , y - intercepts , and background levels for  and , ( 9 ) a shift in the velocity zero point between the lines and the  template , and ( 10 ) a coefficient for scaling the  contamination signal in  ( see  3.2 in paper i ) .",
    "the gas temperature is an important parameter because the  line can be broadened significantly compared to the  template by thermal motions ; see  4.1 in 1   for details .",
    "there are three additional free parameters for  because of the addition of  to the analysis .",
    "note that the linear continuum fitting ( with specific velocity limits as given in   [ gveln(di ) ] and [ zpupn(di ) ] ) is an integral part of the  evaluation , i.e. , the deviations of the continuum levels are considered , in addition to the behavior inside the  profiles .",
    "the same holds for the zero level as defined by the bottom of the adjacent  profile .",
    "we used powell s method ( press et al .",
    "1992 , p. 406 ) to find the minimum .",
    "we then set confidence limits by increasing ( or decreasing )  and @xmath46 with the other parameters freely varying until  increased by the appropriate amount for the confidence limit of interest with two useful parameters ,  and @xmath46 .",
    "we also used different initial values to establish that the minimum  is unique .",
    "in 1  we discussed the benefits of obtaining a velocity profile based on high quality data for  and , two species that are not significantly depleted in the ism and which have very similar ionization balances to those of  and  ( ferlet 1981 ; york et al . 1983 ) .",
    "this profile information is helpful in constraining the variety of possible interpretations that would produce acceptable fits with the d profiles . for , we used imaps spectra of the 10 lines in the multiplets at 952.4 , 953.8 , 954.1 and 1134.7  .",
    "for all of the  lines except those in the 952.4   multiplet , the background level was easily defined because the stronger lines were saturated .",
    "of course , these lines were useful only for defining the behavior of the gas at velocities somewhat removed from the line core",
    ". since the lines in the multiplet at 952.4   were not saturated , we had to determine the background level by a different method . for both   and , there are u1 scans of this weak multiplet available in the archive of spectra recorded by the  satellite ( rogerson et al . 1973 ) .",
    "after comparing our imaps spectrum degraded to the resolution of  with the actual  scans , we determined the adjustments to the background levels that were needed for the imaps spectra of this  multiplet .",
    "the backgrounds caused by grating scatter in the  spectra were taken from the observed count rates in the bottoms of the hydrogen  and  lines , and these levels were subtracted off before the comparison was made .    as was done for our analysis in 1",
    ", we adopted a method developed by jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) to create a composite profile for the column density of   as a function of velocity from the 10 lines in the four multiplets , with the weak lines in each case defining the main part of the profile and the strong lines outlining the exact shape of the profile s wings , well away from the saturated part of the line . for places where there was overlap in the useful portions of the lines",

    "even for our strongest  transition used to derive the far wings of  for  ( 1134.98 ) , the telluric absorption should be only one third as strong as the 950.112 feature present in figures [ gvlylines ] and [ zplylines ] , and at a heliocentric velocity of @xmath48 it would be buried in the saturated portion of the profile . consequently , telluric  has a negligible effect on the interstellar  profiles .    is the best tracer of  in the ism since the ionization potential of  ( 13.56 ev ) is nearly identical to that of .",
    "the ionization potential of  ( 14.53 ev ) is only slightly greater that that of .",

    "that is , we could envision some stars cycling material only through their shallow layers that are only hot enough to burn deuterium , while others eject material from much deeper layers where the synthesis of heavier elements has taken place .",

    "however , the predicted trends in galactic abundances may not accurately represent what is observable in the diffuse ism .",
    "tenorio - tagle ( 1996 ) showed that the chemical enrichment of the diffuse ism by ob associations , including supernovae from massive stars , is a slow process .",
    "following a supernova explosion , chemically enriched ejecta remain clumpy and not well mixed with the diffuse ism it encounters until it is incorporated into new star forming regions .",
    "this is a result of very long time scales for diffusion between different parcels of gas in the warm ( @xmath139k ) and cold ( @xmath140k ) phases of the ism .",
    "the diffusion time scale for enriched gas to thoroughly mix with the warm diffuse ism can be very long ( @xmath141 yr - tenorio - tagle 1996 ) .",
    "on the spatial scale sampled by the imaps observations , different sight lines may encounter regions with very different dynamical and chemical histories .",
    "differential galactic rotation and random cloud motions are expected to stir the diffuse ism and chemically enriched parcels of gas , but these parcels retain their distinct chemical properties until they are disrupted through photoevaporation , most likely by the formation of new massive stars .",
    "tenorio - tagle finds that diffusion is efficient only for the hot phase of the ism ( @xmath142 yr ) , which accounts for a very small fraction of the total diffuse ism . only after the enriched gas and diffuse gas",
    "are highly ionized would the chemically enriched gas from the earlier generation of stars quickly diffuse into the ambient ism .",
    "thus , the time scale for mixing interstellar gases with different processing histories can be much longer than the chemical evolution time scale .",
    "however , it is possible that interstellar turbulence and its secondary phenomena may accelerate the mixing rate .",
    "since the distribution of star forming regions ( ob associations ) shows large inhomogeneities on scales @xmath143 kpc , their corresponding chemical enrichment of the ism may be expected to be nonuniform as well .",
    "this is perhaps revealed indirectly by variations in region abundances ( peimbert 1999 ) and solar - type stars at similar galactocentric radii ( edvardsson , et al . 1993 ) .",
    "several processes unrelated to stellar nucleosynthesis may , under the right circumstances , alter the atomic d / h ratio of some parcels of interstellar gas ( see lemoine et al .",
    "1999 for a review ) .",
    "d may be incorporated into hd ( watson 1973 ) , but the fraction of molecular gas on our sight lines is very low ( see 1 ) .",
    "differential radiation pressure on d and h ( vidal - madjar et al .",
    "1978 ; bruston et al .",
    "1981 ) may lead to a separation of d in some clouds near strong radiation fields .",
    "adsorption of d onto dust grains ( jura 1982 ) may deplete d from the gas phase .",
    "bauschlicher ( 1998 ) found that reactions of h and d with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) cations might systematically provide some d enrichment in pahs .",
    "a very different perspective has been offered by mullan & linsky ( 1999 ) , who suggested that significant quantities of d may be formed in stellar flares from m dwarf stars and ejected into interstellar space .",
    "some or all of these processes could be at work in the diffuse ism and alter the atomic d / h ratio on individual sight lines , independent of the degree of chemical enrichment from stellar evolution . however , they have not yet been demonstrated to be quantitatively significant .",
    "observational and theoretical tests of the efficiency and applicability of these processes are needed to better understand the mechanisms affecting the d / h ratio in the diffuse ism .",
    "while the d / h ratios derived from imaps spectra are in the general range expected from galactic chemical evolution models , a factor of three variation in the mean d / h ratio on path lengths of several hundred pc is unexpected .",
    "the apparent lack of an anti - correlation of the d / h abundance ratio with the metallicity of the gas and its variability on smaller than expected scales suggests that other processes in the galaxy may be masking more general chemical evolution trends .",
    "this may pose a problem for deriving a `` primordial '' d / h by extrapolating back from d / h measurements in the milky way to extragalactic absorbers at higher and higher redshifts , or to even to evaluate `` primordial '' d / h directly from high redshift observations , until we understand the reasons for these differences .",
    "the spatial variations found in this study underline the importance of high - quality d / h determinations .",
    "d / h measurements in more distant regions of the galaxy are needed to determine whether the properties of the gas within 500 pc of the sun are representative of the galactic disk .",
    "observations with the fuse satellite should probe such more distant environments and hopefully answer some of these questions .",
    "the value of d / h for  is larger than that usually considered typical for the milky way .",
    "this robust result establishes a new lower limit to the primordial d / h ratio . within the framework of standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( walker et al . 1991 ) , the large value of d / h found toward",
    "is equivalent to a cosmic baryon density of @xmath3 .",
    "this error simply reflects the uncertainty in the d / h ratio toward  reported in this paper .",
    "we regard this value of @xmath144 as an upper limit since no correction has been applied for the destruction of deuterium in stars .",
    "this upper limit on @xmath145 is consistent with the preferred values of @xmath145 derived from recent analyses of the boomerang and maxima cosmic microwave background measurements ( e.g. , lange et al . 2000 ; tegmark & zaldarriaga 2000 ; hu et al .",
    "however , any lowering of this upper limit on @xmath145 to correct for astration will lead to a marginal disagreement with simple inflation models ( see figure 4 in tegmark & zaldarriaga 2000 ) and requires adjustments of other cosmological parameters .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath145 upper limit from d / h may be taken as a prior assumption for the constraint of other cosmological parameters using the cmb data ( e.g. , see hu et al .",

    "<S> high resolution far ultraviolet spectra of the early - type stars  and   were obtained to measure the interstellar deuterium abundances in these directions . </S>",
    "<S> the observations were made with the interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( imaps ) during the _ orfeus - spas ii _ mission in 1996 . </S>",
    "<S> imaps spectra cover the wavelength range  9301150  with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the interstellar  features are resolved and cleanly separated from interstellar  in the  and  profiles of both sight lines , and also in the  profile of . </S>",
    "<S> the  profiles were modeled using a velocity template derived from several  lines in the imaps spectra recorded at higher signal - to - noise . to find the best  column density , we minimized  for model   profiles that included not only the  as a free parameter , but also the effects of several potential sources of systematic error which were allowed to vary as free parameters .  </S>",
    "<S> column densities were measured by analyzing   absorption profiles in a large number of  high dispersion spectra for each of these stars and applying this same -minimization technique . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately we found that d / h @xmath1 for  and @xmath2 for , values that contrast markedly with d / h derived in 1  for  ( the stated errors are 90% confidence limits ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the atomic d / h ratio in the ism , averaged over path lengths of 250 to 500 pc , exhibits significant spatial variability . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the observed spatial variations in d / h do not appear to be anticorrelated with n / h , one measure of heavy element abundances . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss some hypotheses to explain the d / h spatial variability . within the framework of standard big bang nucleosynthesis , </S>",
    "<S> the large value of d / h found toward  is equivalent to a cosmic baryon density of @xmath3 , which we regard as an upper limit since there is no correction for the destruction of deuterium in stars .    </S>",
