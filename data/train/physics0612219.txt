    "in atomic physics the spherical symmetry of atoms promotes the spherical coordinates to a special position .",
    "the three independent variables are @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the radial distance of the electron with respect to the nucleus , @xmath3 the polar angle and @xmath4 the azimuthal angle .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the hydrogen atom is separable in these coordinates with wave functions of the form @xmath5 separated into a radial wave function @xmath6 and a spherical harmonic @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , configurations of this type with associated orbitals @xmath8 form the building blocks of slater determinants and consequently of mean field approaches to atomic structure . even for molecules where the presence of multiple nuclei breaks the spherical symmetry ( @xmath9 \\neq 0 $ ] ) ,",
    "single - centre expansions in spherical harmonic basis has been used successfully  @xcite .    for a general problem involving a single active electron",
    "we are thus led to the consideration of the three - dimensional time - dependent schrdinger equation in spherical coordinates and for the reduced wave function ( @xmath10 ) we seek a solution of the form @xmath11 a very important advantage of this representation is that we can benefit from angular momentum theory when dealing with the angular degrees of freedom .",
    "an outstanding problem , however , remains .",
    "the problem , which is referred to as the @xmath12-mixing problem among computational scientists , is that often couplings  external or internal  are present that introduce a mixing of @xmath12 s across @xmath13 s .",
    "such @xmath12-mixings occur for example when an atom is subject to an elliptically polarized field or to a linearly polarized field described beyond the dipole approximation .",
    "when @xmath12 is no longer conserved , the dynamics affects all three coordinates and a numerical simulation is difficult : three - dimensional calculations tend to be extremely time - consuming and computationally demanding .",
    "in the course of our recent work concerned with alignment - dependent response of molecules to strong external fields we found a solution that speeds up the calculation by the use of an exact mapping of the three - dimensional problem to two two - dimensional problems . in the following",
    "we discuss the method by the specific example of the response of an arbitrarily oriented diatomic molecule to an external perturbation so strong that the system is ionized .",
    "as will become clear , the central ideas are completely general and carry over to the related case of atoms in elliptically polarized fields , polyatomic molecules as well as @xmath12-problems in geology and astronomy where expansions in spherical harmonics are also often encountered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we give an overview over the basic idea of our technique . in sec .",

    ", dashed ) with respect to the laboratory fixed system ( @xmath14 , solid ) . in the figure only the euler angles @xmath15 are nonvanishing . ]",
    "we illustrate the basic ideas and principles of the method by discussing the specific example of a linear diatomic molecules in an external electromagnetic field . in fig .",
    "[ fig : euler ] we show the coordinate systems which are relevant for the field - molecule problem .",
    "the coordinates @xmath16 specify the laboratory ( @xmath14 ) fixed coordinate system defined by the external polarization vector .",
    "we assume that the field is linearly polarized and return to the generalization to elliptically polarized light in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] . the coordinate system denoted by superscripts",
    "@xmath17 is the molecular fixed frame and is rotated by the euler angles @xmath18 with respect to the laboratory fixed system .",
    "the rotation is accomplished by an @xmath19 rotation around the @xmath20-axis , followed by a @xmath21 rotation around the @xmath22-axis , and finally a @xmath23 rotation around the @xmath24-axis . for the case considered the only really distinct geometries are associated with the angle @xmath21 .",
    "results for different orientations due to the angle @xmath19 are trivially related by a simple rotation around the @xmath20 axis .",
    "also the @xmath23 rotations around the molecular axis are insignificant as a consequence of the axial symmetry of the molecule .",
    "we want to determine how the wave function of an electron is affected by the operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 , corresponding to the interaction with the nuclei and the field , respectively .",
    "we assume that we can treat these two operators separately , which is the case in a split - operator approach as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation ] below .",
    "our strategy is first to represent the wave function in the molecular frame and calculate the action of @xmath25 .",
    "secondly , we transform the updated wave function to the laboratory fixed frame and apply the operator @xmath27 . finally we can return to the molecular frame by the inverse rotation .",

    "the double headed arrow shows the direction of the laser polarization vector . in ( a )",
    "we calculate the action of the molecular potential and express the wave function in the molecular frame with the internuclear axis parallel to the @xmath29 axis . in panel ( b )",
    "we transform the wave function to the laboratory fixed system with the laser polarization parallel to the @xmath29 axis in order to propagate by the field interaction .",
    "the transformation between the two frames is represented by the rotation operator @xmath30 . ]",
    "these forward ( @xmath21 ) and backward ( @xmath31 ) rotations of the wave function are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] . the active interaction ( @xmath25 or @xmath27 )",
    "is marked by black and the inactive operation is gray .",
    "this propagation scheme for arbitrary orientation of the polarization axis with respect to the internuclear axis , exhibits the strength of the present approach since it allows us to perform the calculations very efficiently .",
    "whenever we apply an axially symmetric operator , we do not mix different @xmath12 states provided that the wave function is expressed in the proper reference frame .",
    "thus we can apply the operator separately on each different @xmath12 state .",
    "the decoupling of different @xmath12 states means effectively that we have reduced the three - dimensional problem to a number of two - dimensional problems in addition to two rotation operations .",
    "the rotation transformation is in principle possible in all sets of coordinates and the separation in @xmath12 applies to any coordinate system where the azimuthal angle @xmath4 is an independent variable , e.g. cylindrical , parabolic , or spheroidal coordinates .",
    "the two unique features of the spherical representation are that ( i ) the transformation matrix contains wigner rotation functions which are known analytically and ( ii ) the transformation is guaranteed to be exactly unitary for functions that are bandwidth limited by a maximum @xmath32 , i.e. , the population in states with @xmath33 is zero .",
    "in the present work , we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for the electronic motion in h@xmath0 in the presence of a time - dependent electromagnetic field .",
    "we represent the angular variables in a basis of spherical harmonics and write the reduced wave function as in eq .  .",
    "the radial functions @xmath34 which contain the time dependence are discretized on an equidistant spatial mesh .",
    "the expansion in spherical harmonics is truncated such that @xmath35 leading to a total number of @xmath36 angular basis functions .",
    "the reduced wave function satisfies the tdse with the hamiltonian [ atomic units @xmath37 are used throughout ] @xmath38 where @xmath14 is the usual angular momentum operator and @xmath39 includes the electronic interaction with the field and the nuclei .",
    "we solve the time - evolution from time @xmath40 to @xmath41 numerically by using the split - operator technique @xmath42 the error in the propagation scheme above is approximately cubic in @xmath43 and occurs mainly due to the splitting of non - commuting operators .",
    "a related propagation scheme was applied in geometries with azimuthal symmetry @xcite , and the propagation techniques used for the kinetic operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 are readily extended to our fully three - dimensional problem",
    ". we will therefore turn to the new propagation method of the molecular potential and the field interaction .",
    "we describe the electromagnetic field in the dipole approximation by the vector potential @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the envelope function , @xmath48 the frequency and @xmath49 the polarization direction .",
    "the electric field is obtained as @xmath50 . the operator @xmath39 in eq .",
    "is written as the sum of the field interaction and the molecular potential @xmath51 where the subscripts denote the variables on which the operators act .",

    "[ fig : rotation ]  ( a ) ] and @xmath53 the polar angle in the laboratory fixed system [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ]  ( b ) ] .",
    "the molecular operator is diagonal in coordinate space @xmath54 while the field interaction can be represented either in the length- ( lg ) or the velocity gauge ( vg ) as    @xmath55 & \\text{vg }    \\end{array }    \\right .. \\ ] ]    to calculate the action of @xmath39 in the propagation we make the split @xmath56 for each radial grid point @xmath57 we write the wave function as a vector in the spherical harmonics basis , cf .",
    "@xmath58 where the coefficients refer to the molecular frame .",
    "the molecular potential is diagonal in the radial coordinate , and can not induce mixings vectors that belong to different radial coordinates .",
    "we evaluate the action of @xmath59 by its matrix representation in the spherical harmonics basis for each fixed value of @xmath2 @xmath60 the selection rule @xmath61 occurs since @xmath25 is independent of @xmath62 .",

    "it is clear that the propagation can be accomplished separately within each @xmath12 subspace , and the full three - dimensional propagation effectively reduces to independent two - dimensional propagations , which can be solved by matrix multiplications on each @xmath12 block .",
    "there is a total number of @xmath64 individual @xmath12 blocks with dimensionality between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "after having applied the molecular potential we transform the wave function to the laboratory fixed frame .",
    "we relate the expansion in spherical harmonics in different frames by representation of the rotation operator in spherical harmonics , i.e. , the wigner rotation matrix @xmath67 . the laboratory fixed expansion coefficients",
    "are then obtained as @xmath68 .",
    "we note that this matrix multiplication is very fast since the rotation does not mix different @xmath13 s and @xmath67 is consequently sparse .",
    "also note that the rotation operation is independent of the radial coordinate and we can therefore use the same rotation operation on all the vectors   for different @xmath2 s .",
    "having obtained the wave function in the laboratory fixed frame , we can easily apply the field interaction operator . again , without @xmath12-couplings , the individual two - dimensional problems can be solved straightforwardly  @xcite . finally we return to the molecular frame by the inverse transformation @xmath69 .",
    "we close this section with a few remarks on the scaling of the computations with the size of the problem . in an alternative three - dimensional approach where we in a single step treat the total @xmath39 and mix between all @xmath36 angular basis states , the computational complexity scales as",
    "@xmath70  @xcite . our present method ,",
    "on the other hand , scales more favourably as @xmath71 .",
    "in numerical simulations for typical bandwidths of @xmath72 , we have checked that both three - dimensional methods agree in their predictions but with a great speed - up of the order of a factor of @xmath73 in favor of the new method .",
    "we calculate the ionization probability for h@xmath0 induced by a strong infra - red light source .",
    "the two protons are fixed at the equilibrium internuclear distance of @xmath74 .",
    "the field is taken to be linearly polarized with frequency @xmath75 , and peak intensity @xmath76 .",
    "we use a sine - square envelope function that encloses seven optical cycles , corresponding to a total pulse duration of @xmath77 .",
    "convergent results are obtained with @xmath78 and @xmath79 radial grid points extending to a box size of @xmath80 . in order to avoid reflections at the edge of the box , we impose an absorbing boundary .",
    "the time step size is @xmath81 .",
    "we choose the velocity gauge form of the interaction since it is superior to the length gauge in producing converged results for dynamical problems  @xcite .",
    "first we calculate the angular differential ionization probability . for that purpose",
    "we need the gauge invariant current density @xmath82 ,    \\label{eq : flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the canonical momentum .",
    "we relate the outgoing radial probability flux at some large distance @xmath84 to the differential ionization probability in the laboratory fixed frame @xmath85 we must of course choose @xmath84 to be smaller than the radial distance at which we turn on the absorbing potential .     for the alignment angles ( a ) @xmath86 , ( b ) @xmath87 , and ( c ) @xmath88 .",
    "the laser polarization direction is vertical in all panels and the molecular axis is indicated by the thick solid line .",
    "the numbers on the axes indicate @xmath89 .",
    "the parameters of the electromagnetic field are specified in the text . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : ion_angular ] shows the angular differential probabilities for the alignment angles @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . in all cases , the electron escapes exclusively in a very narrow cone along the polarization direction .",
    "these results are in accordance with expectations from the quasistatic tunneling picture . the ionization dynamics is often considered as being tunneling - like for strong , low frequency fields where the keldysh parameter fullfils @xmath90  @xcite . in the present case @xmath91 at the peak intensity . in the tunneling picture",
    "the electron is assumed to escape near the field direction since the barrier has its shortest spatial extension in that direction  @xcite .",
    "the most notable difference between panels ( a)-(c ) is the overall scaling of the distribution which decreases with increasing angle between the polarization and internuclear axes .",
    "we can qualitatively explain this observation by the associated decrease in electronic charge density of the intial @xmath92-orbital after the polarization direction ( see countour plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] ) .",
    "the same reasoning carries over to the behavior of the total alignment dependent ionization probabilities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ion_tot ] . the results in this figure can be obtained by    . ]    integrating the differential ionization probability eq .   over all directions .",
    "alternatively , we may project out the bound state components of the final wave function . for comparison ,",
    "[ fig : ion_tot ] also contains the results from ref .",
    "@xcite which were obtained by a field of the same frequency and peak intensity but with a slightly different pulse shape ( trapezoidal ) and longer duration .",
    "we find somewhat lower ionization probabilities than in ref .",
    "@xcite since our pulse is at the peak intensity for a shorter duration of time .",
    "although the two data series are not directly comparable , the overall behaviour is similar , namely decreasing ionization probability with increasing alignment angle from parallel ( @xmath86 ) to perpendicular ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a new approach that accurately and efficiently resolves the @xmath12-mixing problem in large scale computations in a spherical coordinate system .",
    "the method relies on an identification of rotations in the intermediate propagation that brings the wave function into a frame of reference in which @xmath12 is conserved .",
    "this means that time - consuming @xmath12-mixing induced by the external perturbation is avoided and instead delegated to the rotations which are very efficiently implemented using the wigner rotation matrix representation of the rotation operator in the spherical harmonics basis .",
    "we have chosen the linear molecule interacting with a linearly polarized field to illustrate our method , but a similar approach can be used in a much broader range of three - dimensional problems .",
    "for example we could consider an elliptically polarized field . in the split operator method",
    "we take the time step @xmath43 to be small enough such that the field can be taken to be constant both in magnitude and polarization direction within the small time interval .",
    "we can therefore consider a time - dependent laboratory frame which follows the instantaneous polarization direction .",
    "if we make the transformation from the molecular frame to the new laboratory frame , we are again able to treat the field as being linear and propagate as discussed above .",
    "our method can also be extended to arbitrary nuclear positions .",
    "for any nuclear configuration , we can attach a coordinate system to each nucleus with a @xmath29 axis from the origin to the nucleus .",
    "then we decompose the molecular potential to a sum of nuclear potentials , each of which can be propagated with azimuthal symmetry in their own reference frame . despite the fact that we now need rotations between the coordinate systems belonging to all of the nuclei ,",
    "the total calculation is still in the same complexity class with respect to scaling in @xmath93 ."
