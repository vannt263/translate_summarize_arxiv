    "the hypernuclei serves as an invaluable source of information for hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions .",
    "new discovery of the double hypernucleus @xcite provided more reliable data which would revise previous understanding based on the old data @xcite that the @xmath7 interaction was fairly strong .",
    "a quantity ( ) , which is defined as @xmath8 or equivalently @xmath9 , is meant to deduce the strength of the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "the new data indicated that ( ) @xmath10 mev .",
    "however , it contains many body effects .",
    "since exact few body calculations are not practical yet apart from very light ordinary nuclei , the understanding of these effects from the viewpoint of standard nuclear many body theory is useful .",
    "it has also been pointed out that hypernuclear systems work as an interesting testing ground of nuclear many body theories . in this paper",
    "we estimate rearrangement effects @xcite in a framework of the brueckner theory @xcite for and .",
    "when matrix elements between nucleons and lambdas are needed , we use the @xmath11 quark model potential @xcite , which provides a successful unified description for octet baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "rearrangement effects in theoretical consideration of hypernuclei have been discussed by many authors .",
    "variational calculations @xcite with a jastrow trial function addressed the problem of the core polarization effect",
    ". the repulsive energy change due to the nuclear core polarization was also discussed in mean field calculations with a relativistic parameterization @xcite and skyrme type of density dependent effective forces @xcite .",
    "our discussion in this paper is focused on brueckner rearrangement energies which arise through the energy - dependence of the reaction matrix and the pauli principle .",
    "the correspondence of these effects to higher order correlations in fermi hypernetted chain approach is not straightforward .",
    "we first present the treatment of the energy change of the core in from .",
    "this problem was discussed by bando and shimodaya @xcite in relation with the overbinding problem of .",
    "the estimation of the rearrangement energy for the @xmath1 in nuclear matter was presented by dabrowski and khler @xcite as early as in 1964 . in the present consideration",
    "we show that numerical evaluation of relevant matrix elements can be avoided and that the potential energy change is shown to be connected to the @xmath1 separation energy of and the wound integral of nucleon pairs .",
    "thus the estimation is more solid than that of bando and shimodaya .",
    "recently , nemura , akaishi and suzuki @xcite showed by their variational calculations that the addition of the @xmath1 decreases the core energy in by 4.7 mev .",
    "the variational calculation in @xcite , on the other hand , suggested that the rearrangement energy is small .",
    "the discussion of the corresponding effects in the standard nuclear many body theory is helpful .",
    "next we consider the rearrangement energy in ( ) .",
    "again it is shown that the essential ingredient can be written by the @xmath1 separation energy of , wound integrals of nucleon pairs and nucleon - lambda pairs . in this case",
    "the pauli rearrangement contribution of the @xmath1 particle also appears .",
    "the recognition of these possible rearrangement effects in hypernuclei is important , because sophisticated calculations in which the structure dependence of effective interactions is ignored have been often presented , particularly , in cluster models",
    "when one or two lambda particles are added to @xmath13he , the interaction between the @xmath1 and nucleons causes a change of correlations among nucleons and thus the energy expectation value in the nucleon sector , fig .",
    "1(a ) , would change .",
    "a part of this change is through the change of wave functions .",
    "another important effect comes from the change of three - body correlations . in the framework of the lowest order brueckner theory @xcite",
    ", they are represented through the modification of pauli effects and starting energy dependence .",
    "since the change of nucleon pauli effects is absent for the addition of hyperons , a relevant correlation is the potential insertion for hole states , fig .",
    "a requirement of self - consistency @xcite for the hole energies means the inclusion of some second order hole - line insertions , figs .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) .    in the lowest order brueckner theory , a ground state potential energy of , starting from the realistic @xmath14 interaction @xmath15 ,",
    "is given by introducing @xmath16-matrix elements : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to a sole occupied @xmath20 state besides implicit spin and isospin summations .",
    "the standard choice of the intermediate spectra @xmath21 is a @xmath22 prescription .",
    "the self - consistency of @xmath23 and @xmath16 means that the hole line potential insertion , a part of three - body correlations , is taken into account . in finite nuclei hartree - fock condition is also required .",
    "however , in the nucleus a single harmonic oscillator function provides a very good approximation .",
    "it is also known that the core in the differs little from the . in the following discussion",
    "we assume that the single - particle wave function is given by the same harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) ( 0s ) function both for and .",
    "then , the potential energy of the core in is also given by an expression similar to eq .",
    "( 1 ) :    @xmath24    in this case the single - particle potential includes a contribution of the @xmath1 particle .",
    "the added lambda particle does not modify pauli exclusion operators for nucleons in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 6 ) . in the above framework",
    "the difference between @xmath25 and @xmath26 comes from the difference of @xmath23 .    to estimate the difference between @xmath26 and @xmath25 , we rewrite the expression as follows : @xmath27 using the well - known relation @xmath28 @xmath29",
    "is expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is @xmath32 at this stage we may introduce an approximation of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the denominator . using the relation @xmath35",
    "the difference of the potential energy expectation value becomes @xmath36 where we introduced @xmath37 which has been known as a wound integral .",
    "there being only one single - particle state , @xmath31 is also expressed in terms of @xmath38 : @xmath39 thus we find @xmath40 substituting this result for @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , we finally obtain the following expression .",
    "estimation of the matrix element @xmath42 requires a knowledge of the @xmath1 and nucleon wave functions .",
    "however , this matrix element can be related to the @xmath1 separation energy @xmath43 which is known experimentally to be @xmath44 mev ; @xmath45 where we write the difference of the center of mass kinetic energy as @xmath46 . in order to simplify expressions",
    "we utilize the fact that there is only one nucleon single - particle state . inserting @xmath29 of eq .",
    "( 15 ) into the right hand side , we obtain @xmath47 hence , eliminating the @xmath48 matrix element in eq .",
    "( 14 ) , we end up with the following estimation : @xmath49 it is worthwhile to note that this difference of the potential energy contributions is due to the effect through the starting energy dependence of @xmath14 @xmath16-matrices .",
    "the addition of the @xmath1 to makes the single - particle energy of the nucleon deeper , which induces less attractive @xmath14 reaction matrices .",
    "thus , the expression of eq .",
    "( 18 ) does not explicitly include the quantity such as @xmath48 correlations .",
    "supposing a single harmonic oscillator wave function with the oscillator constant @xmath50 , the kinetic energy expectation value @xmath51 is expressed as @xmath52 , while @xmath46 is given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 being the nucleon and lambda masses , respectively .",
    "the wound integral @xmath56 is estimated by employing nuclear matter @xmath16-matrix calculations in in the following scheme .",
    "the matrix element @xmath57 between @xmath20 nucleon states with the oscillator constant @xmath58 is evaluated by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is obtained by the equation @xmath61 in numerical calculations , a standard oscillator constant of @xmath62 @xmath63 was taken for , and the fermi momentum @xmath64 was set to be 1.2 @xmath65 since the average density @xmath66 is 0.106 @xmath67 which corresponds to @xmath68 @xmath65 .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath69 tells us that @xmath56 is about @xmath70 , which is reasonable .",
    "expecting @xmath50 to be @xmath71 @xmath63 , we obtain @xmath29 as @xmath72 mev .",
    "although further contributions from orbital rearrangement and other higher order correlations are expected , it is important to settle the order of magnitude of rearrangement effects in by simple and transparent arguments .",
    "in this section , we consider the energy @xmath73 .",
    "it is straightforward to decompose it to each matrix element : @xmath74 where the single - particle wave functions are assumed to be common in , and , and @xmath75 is the contribution of kinetic energy terms which is discussed later . in order to obtain an information for the strength of the @xmath2 interaction @xmath76 from experimental data of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , it is necessary to estimate rearrangement contributions which correspond to the first and the second terms of the above expression . since the changes from @xmath80 to @xmath81 and from @xmath81 to @xmath82 are the same in the leading order , the first term of eq .",
    "( 21 ) should be small because of the cancellation @xmath83 .",
    "the second term represents the main source of the rearrangement effect . as in eq .",
    "( 8) , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a single - particle energy difference . in this case",
    "the change of the pauli blocking for @xmath1 also contributes . in the following presentation",
    ", we neglect the contribution from the term including @xmath86 because of its restricted summation compared with @xmath87 .    writing @xmath88 as @xmath89 where @xmath90 stands for a @xmath1 @xmath20 state and @xmath91 for a nucleon unoccupied state , @xmath92 the first term is positive because the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative .",
    "the second term is also positive if @xmath93 , as the @xmath48 interaction @xmath94 becomes more attractive when the starting energy @xmath95 becomes shallower and thus the derivative of the matrix element with respect to @xmath95 is negative . to estimate @xmath96",
    ", we calculate the energy differences @xmath97 and @xmath98 as follows : @xmath99 in order to simplify these expressions , we introduce following notations : @xmath100 using the wound integral @xmath101 for the @xmath48 pair , the energy differences are written as @xmath102 then , noticing the relation @xmath103 , @xmath104 becomes @xmath105 inserting this into @xmath106 , @xmath107 can be expressed as @xmath108 the estimation of @xmath3 finally reads @xmath109 since @xmath107 is positive as remarked above , the @xmath3 becomes smaller than @xmath110 .",
    "some comments are necessary for the contribution of @xmath75 .",
    "the assumption of the same single - particle wave functions implies @xmath111 which amounts to 0.37 mev with @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath112 @xmath63 , and thus partly cancels the negative contribution of @xmath113 .",
    "however , @xmath75 is sensitive to the change of single - particle wave functions .",
    "it has been known that the addition of the @xmath1 to makes the @xmath1 single - particle wave function compact @xcite . in that case",
    ", @xmath75 becomes even negative . in the estimation below we leave out this contribution .",
    "the matrix element @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( 32 ) is estimated by eq .",
    "new ingredients here are the wound integral @xmath115 and the pauli blocking effect @xmath116 .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath48 reaction matrix element is much weaker than that of the @xmath14 interaction , since the @xmath48 tensor force , which is an important source of the @xmath95-dependence , is weak because of the absence of the lowest order pion exchange .",
    "we find @xmath117 from the @xmath95-dependence of the calculated @xmath48 reaction matrices .",
    "the pauli blocking effect is estimated by evaluating the matrix element @xmath118 from the hypernuclear matter @xmath16 matrix @xmath119 by solving the equation similar to eq .",
    "half of the difference between matrix elements with @xmath120 and @xmath121 gives @xmath122 mev .",
    "the calculation of @xmath123 is carried out , as in eq .",
    "( 19 ) , by the momentum space folding of nuclear matter @xmath2 @xmath16-matrix , in which the coupling with the @xmath124 and @xmath125 channels is included .",
    "the quark model potential fss2 @xcite indicates that @xmath126 is @xmath127 mev for @xmath128 @xmath63 , and @xmath129 mev for @xmath130 @xmath63 . in these calculations , the starting energy @xmath131 in the energy denominator of the @xmath16-matrix equation",
    "is set to be @xmath132 mev .",
    "the @xmath115 is 0.05 for @xmath128 @xmath63 , and 0.06 mev for @xmath130 @xmath63 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath133 mev , namely = 1.24 mev , for @xmath128 @xmath63 and @xmath134 mev , namely = 1.53 mev , for @xmath130 @xmath63 . since we should expect other effects not considered here such as the change of wave functions and the contribution of the first term of eq . (",
    "21 ) , more quantitative evaluation of the actual rearrangement contribution would be desirable .",
    "it is instructive to present the matrix element @xmath126 calculated with other available @xmath2 interactions .",

    "the knowledge of this quantity is important to deduce the information of strengths of hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions from experimental binding energies . in the standard framework of the lowest order brueckner theory @xcite , from which invaluable understanding of nuclear systems has been accumulated for more than 40 years",
    ", the principal contribution to rearrangement energies is due to the starting energy dependence of the effective interaction as well as the change of pauli blocking effect .",
    "since we have avoided specific numerical calculations as much as possible , our results may not be very quantitative .",
    "on the other hand , the magnitude of the estimated values is rather robust .",
    "the energy of the @xmath0 core part is reduced by about 2 mev when the single - particle energy becomes deeper by the addition of @xmath1 to .",
    "this effect is connected with the overbinding problem of the @xmath137-shell hypernulcei , as bando and shimodaya @xcite discussed in 1980 .",
    "the new aspect of our presentation is the treatment of the estimation of the matrix element @xmath138 . instead of calculating it directly , we relate it to the @xmath1 separation energy , which is by itself influenced by the rearrangement energy .",
    "as it should be , our result confirmed their estimation .",
    "the rearrangement energy discussed in this paper is certainly not a sole answer for the overbinding problem .",
    "core polarization effects should be considered , though the core is rather rigid .",
    "several estimations @xcite suggested that the energy change due to the core polarization is about 0.5 mev or less .",
    "three - body correlations and @xmath139 three - body forces should also be taken into account . in the former case the coupling to the @xmath140 intermediate state plays a characteristic role .",
    "it is important to treat three - body correlation effects together without three - body forces , which is an interesting subject for future investigation .",
    "we next considered rearrangement effects to obtain the matrix element of the @xmath2 interaction from the observed masses of double lambda hypernuclei .",
    "the experimental determination of the which is defined as @xmath141 does not directly tell the strength of the @xmath2 interaction , since it contains the rearrangement energies .",

    "our calculation is based on the argument of the many body theory in the model space .",
    "the extension of few body type calculations using bare interactions for hypernuclei such as and would clarify the same subject directly from the basic microscopic viewpoint .",
    "as for the , nemura , akaishi and suzuki @xcite recently showed by variational calculations that core energy in decreases by 4.7 mev .",
