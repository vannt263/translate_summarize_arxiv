    "during the last few decades many theoretical and experimental studies have investigated the critical properties of statistical systems in the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "typical examples are randomly dilute uniaxial antiferromagnets , for instance , fe@xmath9zn@xmath10f@xmath11 and mn@xmath9zn@xmath10f@xmath11 , obtained by mixing a uniaxial antiferromagnet with short - range interactions with a nonmagnetic material .",
    "experiments find that , for sufficiently low impurity concentration 1@xmath12 , these systems undergo a second - order phase transition at @xmath13 , with critical exponents independent of the impurity concentration .",
    "the experimental results have been summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , which reports @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "these estimates are definitely different from the values of the critical exponents of the pure ising universality class , where , e.g. , @xmath17 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and thus indicate that the impurities change the nature of the transition that belongs to a new random universality class . in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "dilute uniaxial antiferromagnets show a different critical transition , belonging to the universality class of the random - field ising model @xcite .",
    "a simple model for dilute uniaxial systems is provided by the three - dimensional random ising model ( rim ) with hamiltonian @xmath18 where the sum is extended over all nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath19 are ising spin variables , and @xmath20 are uncorrelated quenched random variables , which are equal to one with probability @xmath12 ( the spin concentration ) and zero with probability @xmath21 ( the impurity concentration ) . for small @xmath21 , i.e. above the percolation threshold of the spins , this model shows a critical transition analogous to that observed in experiments and whose nature has been the object of many theoretical studies , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "numerical monte carlo simulations @xcite had long been inconclusive in setting the question of the critical behavior of the rim . while the measured critical exponents were definitely different from the ising ones , results apparently depended on the spin concentration , in disagreement with renormalization - group ( rg ) theory .",
    "only recently has the question been clarified .",
    "@xcite showed the presence of very strong concentration - dependent scaling corrections with exponent @xmath22 .",
    "only if they are properly taken into account , the numerical estimates of the critical exponents become dilution independent as expected .",
    "their final estimates are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , from which one also derives @xmath25 and @xmath26 using scaling relations .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the experimental ones reported above , although the numerical estimate of @xmath27 is slightly different .    randomly dilute ising systems can also be studied by using the field - theoretical ( ft ) approach @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the cubic - symmetric hamiltonian @xcite @xmath28    + { 1\\over 4 ! } \\sum_{i , j=1}^n \\left ( u_0 + v_0 \\delta_{ij } \\right ) \\phi^2_i \\phi^2_j   \\bigr\\ } ,   \\label{hphi4rim}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is an @xmath30-component field . by using the standard replica trick",
    ", it can be shown that in the formal limit @xmath31 such a model corresponds to a system with quenched disorder effectively coupled to the energy density , as is the case of the rim @xcite . as is well known",
    ", the limit @xmath31 is a subtle one . in the standard perturbative approaches ,",
    "the limit is taken naively ",
    "we simply set @xmath32 in the perturbative expansion  implicitly assuming that the replica symmetry is not broken . in recent years , however , this assumption has been questioned  @xcite on the ground that the rg approach may not take into account other local minimum configurations of the random hamiltonian ( [ hphi4rim ] ) , which may cause the spontaneous breaking of the replica symmetry . however , a fixed - dimension perturbative two - loop calculation @xcite in a perturbative approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite finds that the standard replica - symmetric fixed point is stable under any replica - symmetry breaking perturbation , thereby supporting the standard approach . in this paper",
    ", we do not further consider this issue and in the following we always assume that the standard approach is correct .",
    "note that the good agreement among numerical and field - theoretical results supports this assumption , although one can not exclude that replica - symmetry breaking effects can only be seen very close to the critical point .    in the ft approach one",
    "looks for stable fixed points in the region @xmath33 ( or , equivalently @xmath34 ) . if the pure fixed point at @xmath35 is stable , disorder is irrelevant , while the presence of a new stable fixed point with @xmath34 , indicates that disorder is relevant and that dilute systems belong to a new universality class .",
    "numerical and experimental results indicate that in dilute ising systems the correct scenario is the second one and thus a new random fixed point should be present with @xmath36 .",
    "the most precise ft estimates of critical quantities are presently obtained by using perturbative methods . however , in the case of random systems the perturbative approach faces new difficulties : the perturbative series are not only divergent , but are also non - borel summable @xcite .",
    "this means that even the knowledge of the complete perturbative series does not allow the exact computation of the critical quantities .",
    "these difficulties are clearly present in the @xmath37-expansion and in the related minimal - subtraction scheme without @xmath38-expansion @xcite .",
    "the expansion in @xmath37 is not well behaved and does not allow quantitative determinations of the critical exponents , while in the minimal - subtraction scheme results are very sensitive to the resummation method . if the chisholm - borel method is used @xcite , no random fixed point is found with the longest available series ( five loops ) . apparently , four - loop series provide the most accurate results and increasing the length of the expansion does not help improving the precision of the results . on the other hand , if a double pad - borel resummation is used as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a random fixed point is found also at five loops @xcite .",
    "the estimates of the critical exponents are in any case not very precise , and moreover , at variance with the fixed - dimension approach described below , the stability - matrix eigenvalues turn out to be complex .    the fixed - dimension perturbative expansion in powers of two independent zero - momentum quartic couplings @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( directly related to @xmath41 and @xmath42 defined in eq .",
    "( [ hphi4rim ] ) ) is apparently better behaved .",
    "up to six loops , a random fixed point @xmath43 , @xmath44 is always found , although the estimates of @xmath43 and @xmath44 vary significantly with the order and the resummation method . in spite of that ,",
    "the estimates of the critical exponents are quite precise , due to a relatively large insensitivity of the results to the position of the fixed point .",
    "the analysis of the six - loop series gives @xcite @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the agreement with the experimental and numerical results is again quite satisfactory ; only the estimate of @xmath27 seems to be slightly larger than the experimental result .    in this paper",
    "we present a new numerical study of the rim .",
    "the purpose is to extend and possibly improve the numerical results of ref .",
    "we estimate the critical exponents and , in particular , @xmath27 in order to verify if the apparent small discrepancy between experiments and numerical results is really there .",
    "moreover , we determine the four - point and the six - point zero - momentum couplings , and the universal ratio @xmath49 . as a byproduct we are able to check the accuracy of the ft approach by comparing monte carlo and ft estimates of the fixed - point values @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we have performed a high - precision monte carlo simulation of the model with hamiltonian ( [ latticeh ] ) at @xmath50 and density @xmath51 .",
    "such a value has been chosen on the basis of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that scaling corrections are particularly small for such a value of @xmath12 .",
    "this is fully confirmed by our analysis : we do not observe scaling corrections with exponent @xmath22 , the correction - to - scaling exponent observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for generic values of the density.@xcite note that the absence of corrections with exponent @xmath52 also implies the absence of corrections with exponents @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 therefore , we expect corrections to scaling with next - to - leading exponent @xmath56 ( @xmath57 according to field theory @xcite ) .",
    "unexpectedly , also these corrections are small .",
    "the rim at @xmath51 is therefore an  improved \" model @xcite , i.e. a model in which the leading correction to scaling is ( approximately ) absent in the expansion of any observable near the critical point .",

    "we analyze the specific heat at the critical point obtaining @xmath61 . using the estimate ( [ stima - nu - sez1 ] ) for @xmath62",
    "we obtain @xmath63 which is fully consistent with 3 .",
    "we also perform another check of hyperscaling , analyzing the specific heat and the energy at the critical point .",

    "@xcite , which were obtained from the analysis of perturbative six - loop series : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "clearly , the non - borel summability of the perturbative expansions gives rise to a large systematic error .",
    "it is also possible that the nonanalyticity of the rg functions @xcite near the random fixed point plays an important role .    these discrepancies on the estimates of @xmath43 and @xmath44 call for a reanalysis of the perturbative expansions of the critical exponents .",
