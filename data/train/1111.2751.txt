    "is realized in the presence of sufficiently high occupation numbers per mode or large coherent field expectation values .",
    "the physics of nonequilibrium instabilities provides an important example where classical - statistical simulations techniques can give accurate descriptions of the underlying quantum dynamics .",
    "this has been tested to high accuracy for self - interacting scalar quantum field theories  @xcite and yukawa - like theories with fermions  @xcite , where appropriate far - from - equilibrium resummation techniques are available for the respective quantum field theory . in recent years",

    "they are smooth in this direction and correlated over a transverse size associated to the inverse of the characteristic momentum scale @xmath0 in the saturation scenario  @xcite . to understand the time evolution of this configuration in qcd is a formidable task , which is further complicated by the longitudinal expansion of the system .    in order to approach this complex question of non - linear gauge field dynamics",

    "we neglect expansion and employ a constant color - magnetic field configuration , @xmath2 with color index @xmath3 and lorentz index @xmath4 , whose spatial components @xmath5 point in longitudinal ( @xmath6 ) direction @xmath7 here the latter can always be arranged to point into the direction @xmath8 in color space by a suitable gauge transformation without loss of generality . in the context of heavy ion collisions",

    "such a field configuration is known to exhibit a nielsen - olesen instability  @xcite characterized by an exponential growth of fluctuations with maximum growth rate @xmath11 where @xmath12 may be taken to be of order @xmath0 .",
    "this exponential growth leads to a production of gluons , which is much faster than any conventional production process .",
    "its consequences for the question of thermalization in a heavy ion collision can be significant . of course , in this context a single macroscopic constant color - magnetic background field is certainly not a realistic option and it is important to understand the robustness of the underlying physical processes against suitable generalizations .    in a first generalization",
    "we will allow for temporal modulations of the color magnetic background field configurations .",
    "this can be conveniently achieved by the gauge field configuration @xmath13 with all other components zero .",
    "it can be directly verified that this vector potential configuration gives the same form of the longitudinal magnetic field ( [ eq : blong ] ) . however , there are important differences as compared to the previously considered case , where the magnetic field is generated from space - dependent vector potentials .",

    "an important observation is that the non - linearities lead to a very efficient growth for all components of the gauge potential such that the details about the initial configuration ( [ eq : blong ] ) become irrelevant as long as sufficient primary growth is triggered .",

    "however , this is only a lower estimate , since somewhat larger growth rates can occur if the spatial variations of the magnetic field are such that there are regions with larger magnetic fields which cancel in the average .    remarkably , the growth rates measured in units of the energy density of the system are similar to the growth rates observed in ref .  @xcite . in the latter study",
    "inhomogeneous initial field configurations were randomly generated from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the oblate initial distribution for the spatial fourier modes @xmath150 was characterized by a transverse width @xmath151 and a longitudinal width @xmath152 , where @xmath153 .",
    "this corresponds to an extreme anisotropy with a @xmath154-like distribution in longitudinal direction . as a consequence , the approximately homogeneous field configurations in longitudinal direction employed in ref .",
    "@xcite resemble quite closely the correlated domains employed here if the transverse width @xmath151 is associated to the inverse domain size of our configurations .",
    "in this paper we have studied out - of - equilibrium dynamics in @xmath1 pure gauge field theory . we presented a detailed analytic calculation of the time evolution in the linear regime starting from coherent field configurations . generalizing the well - known nielsen - olesen instabilities for constant color - magnetic fields , in a first step we took into account temporal modulations .",
    "this leads to a remarkable coexistence of the original nielsen - olesen instability for time - averages together with a subdominant instability band because of the phenomenon of parametric resonance .",
    "the comparison to classical - statistical lattice gauge theory simulations showed remarkable agreement between analytics and numerics in the linear regime , while the lattice results show important nonlinear phenomena at later times such as secondary growth rates which are multiples of primary growth rates .",
    "this analysis provided the building blocks for the understanding of the dynamics of more realistic initial conditions including fluctuations .",
    "for the ensemble of coherent fields , which have zero mean color - magnetic field , again robust growth of the nielsen - olesen type is observed .",
    "remarkably , we find that for this ensemble isotropization of the stress - energy tensor happens on a much shorter time scale than the characteristic inverse growth rate of the instability .",
    "this rapid isotropization is a dephasing phenomenon .",
    "rapid isotropization is an important ingredient for the application of hydrodynamic descriptions for heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , in this case longitudinal expansion and increasing diluteness  @xcite can make the system again become more anisotropic . in particular , the observed dephasing phenomenon depends on the fact that the stress - energy tensor is dominated by the homogeneous modes for the considered initial conditions . for spatially inhomogeneous configurations",
    "this is typically not the case .    to see this and in order to make the link to earlier work on plasma instabilities using inhomogeneous initial field configurations",
    ", we finally took into account that the fields should be correlated only over a limited transverse size .",
    "if the transverse size is taken to be @xmath0 or @xmath19 then this should model characteristic aspects of the dynamics of color flux tubes . in this case",
    "we observed exponential growth for all components of the inhomogeneous gauge field configuration .",
    "the nature of the underlying instability still shows properties reminiscent of the nielsen - olesen  type .",
    "in particular , the results indicate that the characteristic dependence of the primary growth rate as a function of momentum still reaches its maximum at low momenta .",
    "in contrast , weibel instabilities are expected to show a vanishing growth rate at zero momentum  @xcite , which has also been emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in view of these results",
    "it is interesting to observe that previous findings about plasma instabilities from classical - statistical lattice gauge theory  @xcite share important aspects of a nielsen - olesen instability .    in this work ,",
    "we have not discussed the extraction of distribution functions and their possible interplay with time - dependent condensates after isotropization as suggested recently in ref .",
    "distribution functions may , for instance , be derived from equal - time correlation functions in coulomb gauge using the classical - statistical simulations employed in this work .",
    "this is deferred to a separate publication  @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank hiro fujii for many inspiring discussions .",
    "they acknowledge the support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft , the university of heidelberg ( frontier ) , the alliance program of the helmholtz association ( ha216/emmi ) , by bmbf and mwfk baden - wrttemberg ( bwgrid cluster ) .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : linear ] we discussed analytic solutions in the linear regime , which concentrated on the dominant exponentially growing modes at low momenta . however , the analysis neglects the phenomenon of parametric resonance in the presence of a periodically evolving background field . in this appendix",
    "we show that this phenomenon leads to a subdominant instability band at higher longitudinal momenta than the nielsen - olesen instability . here",
    "we focus on the evolution of @xmath155 described by ( [ eq : ap ] ) of sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] as this shows the dominant primary instability .",

    "the crucial difference here is the negative sign in front of the oscillating term , which gives rise to the nielsen - olesen type instability discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] .",
    "our strategy for solving the above evolution equation consists of approximating @xmath158 for @xmath159 in ( [ eq : appevo ] ) in order to reduce it to the well known lam equation , where again @xmath160 denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind @xcite . while this approximation captures the important features of ( [ eq : appevo ] ) , it has the shortcoming that the average field strength @xmath161 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : averageb ] ) is overestimated by a factor of @xmath162 consequently , we expect the approximation to yield slightly enhanced growth rates that extent to somewhat higher momenta within about ten percent accuracy of the full numerical solution at early times , where the linear analysis is expected to hold . in order to obtain the solutions for @xmath155 for the above approximation",

    "the different regimes correspond to two stable and two unstable bands .",
    "the lowest band corresponds to the nielsen - olesen instability , whereas the third band corresponds to the parametric resonance instability .",
    "outside these momentum regions all modes are stable within the approximation using ( [ eq : appapprox ] ) .",

    "the modes being subject to the nielsen - olesen instability show no oscillatory behavior according to this approximation .",
    "in contrast , modes which are amplified by the parametric resonance instability follow the oscillation of the macroscopic field @xmath56 . the stable band in between interpolates between the two oscillation frequencies , while at higher momenta @xmath188 the free field limit @xmath189 is approached .",
    "concerning the growth rates one observes that the nielsen - olesen instability exhibits the dominant growth rate when compared to parametric resonance . when comparing the analytic results for the growth rate to lattice data , we find that the analytic prediction is somewhat larger and extends to higher momenta . as mentioned above , this is a consequence of the approximation ( [ eq : appapprox ] ) .",
    "however , one can accurately describe the lattice data by a trivial rescaling of the magnetic field amplitude @xmath17 in the analytical result by a factor of @xmath190 as suggested by ( [ eq : appavgb ] ) to reproduce the correct average amplitude @xmath191 .",
    "the above discussion provided implicit expressions for the growth rate as a function of momentum . to obtain explicit expressions",

    "according to ( [ eq : appb1])-([eq : appb4 ] ) this has to be done separately for each band . in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] we have already provided an explicit expression for the growth rate of the nielsen - olesen instability by an alternative approach . the same is desireable for the parametric resonance instability . to obtain such an expression",

    "though ( [ eq : appbetapr ] ) along with ( [ eq : appgamma ] ) already provides an explicit expression for the growth rate , it proves insightful to apply further approximations . in a first step",
