    "the next  generation linear colliders , such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite , require a large amount of positrons in short time periods .",
    "in particular , the ilc requires a positron beam with the bunch population of @xmath0 , the bunch separation of 332 ns and 1,312 bunches in a bunch train with the train repetition rate of 5 hz .",
    "the design luminosity of the order of @xmath1@xmath2s@xmath3 equals the value of the kekb synchrotron @xcite , which has the highest luminosity in electron  positron colliders .",
    "to realize such high luminosity , the ilc requires acceleration and collision of intense electron and positron beams .",
    "the detail of the issues and the rd of the ilc is described in @xcite . among those issues , the development of an intense positron source is a key to realize the linear collider .",
    "conventionally , positrons are generated by impinging an electron beam of a few gev into a converter target via electromagnetic cascade processes .",
    "the converter target is typically a high  z material such as the tungsten with a thickness of 4 to 6 radiation lengths , which is nearly equal to the depth of the shower maximum . since the converter target is easily damaged by the heat load associated with the development the cascade , conventional systems suffer from limitations on the positron yield due to the heat load .",
    "the damage of the converter target was quantified under the operating condition of slc at slac national accelerator laboratory ( formerly stanford linear accelerator center ) @xcite .",
    "a different approach for generating positrons , which would overcome the heat load problem , is impinging gamma ",
    "rays into the converter target instead of electrons . by using combination of initial photons above o(10 mev ) and",
    "a thin high  z material converter target , positrons are produced in the converter target dominantly via electron ",
    "positron pair production from initial photons and the energy deposition is reduced .",
    "in addition , by keeping the distance between the source of photons and the converter target , the photon beam spot size on the converter target can be increased for relaxing the localized energy deposition .",
    "if intensity of the incident gamma  ray is enough and the thickness of the converter target is appropriately chosen , it may be possible to reduce the heat load in the converter target while ensuring the required positron yield .",
    "for example , the ilc has adopted the positron source driven by gamma ",
    "rays using a long magnetic undulator .",
    "there is a method based on gamma  ray which uses a crystal assisted radiation .",
    "it was proposed by r. chehab and his colleagues at lal dorsay @xcite , and experimental studies has been carried out with the 1.3gev synchrotron in institute for nuclear study , the university of tokyo @xcite , at cern with the experiment wa 103 @xcite and the kekb linac at kek @xcite .",
    "simulations have shown @xcite that a crystal converter presents the advantage of less energy deposition than the equivalent amorphous converter ( giving the same positron yield ) . however , to avoid significant energy deposition in the crystal , due to large incident beam power , which could affect the available string potential  due to thermal vibrations  a separation between the thin crystal  radiator and the thicker amorphous converter led to the hybrid source scheme . moreover , using a dipole magnet in between to remove the charged particles is reducing considerably the energy deposition and the peak energy deposition density .",
    "this last scheme is considered , here , as the hybrid target . in 2007 ,",
    "the hybrid target scheme was proposed by chehab , strakhovenko and variola @xcite as a possible way to generate intense positrons required by clic or ilc . in this article",
    ", we report results of experimental studies to investigate feasibility of the hybrid target as an intense positron sources .",
    "when a charged particle enters parallel to a crystal axis or planes in a crystal material , the transverse electric field of the axis or the planes constrains the particle motion in the transverse direction ; it is known as the channeling effect . in particular ,",
    "an electron is captured by the strong field of an atomic string , which is called the axial channeling @xcite .",
    "the average crystalline potential of an isolated atomic string @xmath4 is approximately expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the thomas - fermi screening radius , @xmath7 is the atomic number of the crystal , @xmath8 is the interatomic spacing in the string , @xmath9 is the electric charge , and @xmath10 is the distance from the axis @xcite . if the transverse kinetic energy @xmath11 of the incident electron with respect to the strings is smaller than the depth @xmath12 of the potential and if the entrance point is close enough to a string , the electron is trapped in the potential well and travels along the axis for some distance depending mainly on its energy .",
    "the transverse energy of the electron can be written in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the transverse component of the electron momentum @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the velocity of light .",
    "considering that @xmath14 is much smaller than @xmath15 , the incident angle @xmath17 with respect to the axis can be written as @xmath18 , and we can transpose expression ( [ eq1 ] ) to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity of the electron .",
    "the channeled electron , which is in a bound state of @xmath21 moves along a screw  like trajectory about the axial direction as shown in a drawing of figure [ screw_trajectory ] .",
    "the incident electrons have a critical angle of capture @xmath22 , so  colled the lindhard angle : @xmath23 for the crystal axis @xmath24 of tungsten used in this experiment , the @xmath25 is 979 ev , and the angle @xmath22 is 0.495 mrad at an incident electron energy of 8 gev",
    ".    channeled electrons emit strong radiation ; the _ channeling radiation_. the intensity of the radiation is expressed in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the transverse acceleration of the electron which moves according to the condition of ( [ eq2 ] ) , and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the channeling radiation has much larger intensity and shorter wavelengths than that of a magnetic undulator , due to the strong field of atoms that causes a short period oscillation with the order of some @xmath29 in the longitudinal direction with the amplitude of the order of an interatomic distance . for the @xmath24 axis of tungsten with the incident electron energy of 8 gev",
    ", it was found by numerical simulations that the intensity of low energy gamma ",
    "rays ( @xmath30 30 mev ) is ten times higher than that of nominal bremsstrahlung .",
    "figure [ brems ] shows the comparison of the photon spectra obtained from a 1.4 mm of tungsten crystal and a 1.4 mm tungsten amorphous converter , the electron energy being 5 gev .    when electrons enter into the crystal with larger angle than @xmath22 , they are no longer trapped by the crystallline potential but are still affected by it",
    "this situation has been discussed in @xcite : the radiation becomes synchrotron like , below a critical incidence angle @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the rest mass of an electron .",
    "the angle @xmath33 is 1.92 mrad for @xmath34 ev which is about 4 times larger than the critical angle of channeling effect .",
    "there is another effect known as coherent bremsstrahlung , which is the coherent radiation of successive planes or strings interfere @xcite .",
    "coherent bremsstrahlung has the spectrum with high - order peaks caused by the condition of interference as ,    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the circular frequency of the photon , @xmath37 is the photon emission angle , @xmath38 , and @xmath8 is the distance between the atoms . in the conditions of an ultrarelativistic case ( @xmath39 ) and forward directing photons ( @xmath40 ) , the expression ( [ cb ] ) is approximated to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is relativistic gamma factor of the incident electron . when the energy of incident electrons @xmath43 is 8 gev , @xmath44 gev @xmath45 for @xmath46 mrad .",
    "therefore the contribution from coherent bremsstrahlung could be expected up to the energy region around a few gev in the experiment .",
    "a series of experiments on positron generation were performed at kek , tsukuba , ibaraki , japan .",
    "a schematic drawing of the hybrid target , which was composed of a single crystal target to produce gamma  rays and an amorphous converter target made of tungsten to generate positrons , is shown in figure [ hybrid_img ] , and the experimental setup installed in the 3rd switchyard of the kekb linac @xcite is shown in figure [ setup ] .",
    "the kekb linac delivers single ",
    "bunch electron beams with energy of 8 gev .",
    "the beam parameters are given in table [ para ] .",
    "the single crystal target made of tungsten was mounted on the 2axes goniometer so as to align the crystal axis to the incident electron beam .",
    "the thickness of the crystal target was 1 mm and @xmath24 axis was aligned to the electron beam .",
    "the surface mosaicity of this crystal on both sides was measured by an x - ray scattering method was @xmath47 mrad .",
    "after the crystal target , a sweeping magnet with a length of 800 mm and a magnetic field of 0.96 tesla was installed to sweep out secondary charged particles generated in the crystal target .",
    "thus , only gamma - rays were directed to the amorphous converter target installed 3313 mm downstream of the crystal target .",
    "five amorphous converter targets of different thicknesses , 1.75 , 3.5 , 5.25 , 8 and 18 mm , were mounted on a linear stage to place the converter target of desired thickness on the beam line during the experiment .",
    "the particles from the converter target were directed into a vacuum chamber kept at pressure of @xmath48 torr .",
    "positrons with momenta of 5 , 10 or 20 mev/@xmath16 were selected by a magnetic momentum analyzer and led into the detector through collimators . in between the analyzing magnet and the detector ,",
    "3 collimators of aperture of 20 mm were placed to reduce background as well as to improve the momentum resolution .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of the detector was 0.22 msr which was defined by the collimator just before the detector .",
    "for the data analysis , which is described in section 4 . 2 ,",
    "the efficiency of the detector system was evaluated by the simulation which took into account geometrical configuration of all components .",
    "the detector comprised lucite cherenkov counter , its output is proportional to the number of incident positrons to the detector .",
    "thermocouples were stuck on the back surface of two amorphous converter targets ( 8 mm and 18 mm ) to measure the temperature from which we expect to get information of the heat load on the converter target due to the cascade shower .",
    "the positron yield was investigated in three experimental setup as shown in figure [ scheme ] .",
    "the first one was the _ conventional _ scheme in which the incident electron beam with energy of 8 gev directly irradiated the amorphous converter target .",
    "the second was the _ hybrid on axis _ , and the last is the _ hybrid off axis_. in these schemes , the single crystal target is inserted into the beamline .",
    "charged particles coming out from the crystal were swept out by the sweeping magnet and only photons from the crystal were directed to the amorphous converter target .",
    "the crystallographic axis is aligned with the direction of the incident electron beam at the _ on axis _ , but not at the _ off axis _ scheme , respectively .",
    "therefore , the enhancement effect by the crystal assisted radiation occurs only in second scheme . in these three schemes ,",
    "five converter targets with different thicknesses were tested in order to measure the thickness dependence in the generated positron yield .",
    "momentum dependence in the positron yield was also measured with the analyzing magnet .",
    "the contribution of the background for the _ conventional _ scheme were estimated by the data taken without converter targets on the beamline .",
    "as for the background estimation in the hybrid schemes , the crystal was removed from the beamline and the sweeping magnet was turned on ; only the synchrotron radiation from incident electrons was irradiating the converter target .",
    "transverse sizes of the incident electron beam on the single crystal target and the amorphous converter target were measured by using a fluorescent screen before and after the experiment .",
    "the standard deviation of the two measurements are shown in table [ spot ] .",
    "it is found that the profile of the electron beam was elliptic at the single crystal target but almost circular at the converter target .",
    "the angular spread of the electron beam was estimated from the beam sizes at the position of the crystal target and the converter target , and were 0.15 mrad for horizontal ( x ) and 0.030 mrad for vertical ( y ) directions , respectively .",
    ".properties of the incident electron beam .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we clearly observed the increase of positron yield when the crystal axis is aligned to the electron beam .",
    "the width of the rocking curve was wider than the critical angle of the channeling effect or the angular spread of the incident electron beam , that was consistent with previous experiment indicating appreciable contribution of radiation from other than the channeling effect .",
    "this fact is advantageous in practical operation , since it relaxes the precision of the alignment of the crystal target to the electron beam .",
    "since it has been confirmed that the simulation reproduces the experimental data , one would be able to perform the optimization in designing a positron source with the hybrid target by using the simulation . according to the initial simulation ,",
    "the angular spread of the positrons from the hybrid target was wider than the conventional target . because of small angular acceptance of current experimental set up , what we observed in figure [ sep ] is smaller a part of the yields for the hybrid target than those for the conventional target .",
    "in addition , the tungsten crystal may not be the best choice for the electron  photon converter .",
    "constructing the optimum target and positron capture section by using the simulation may give us the final conclusion of the ability to produce more positrons .",
    "the result of temperature rise measurement gives us basic information about to evaluate the energy deposition in the positron converter target .",
    "we need further study to evaluate relation between the measured temperature and energy deposition , however , it will be applicable to any positron target system once it is established .    to evaluate the yield performance in the hybrid target , a simulation including a capture system is planned . to advance designs of the hybrid target , it is important to select the crystal material that gives the highest enhancement in gamma  rays , and to develop the converters with an efficient cooling system .",
    "on the temperature measurement , we plan to measure a spatial distributions in the temperature rise measurement with arrayed thermocouples .",
    "authors would like to thank operation crew of the kekb linac for providing excellent beams during the experiment .",
