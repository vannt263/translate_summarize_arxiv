    "all realistic turbulent flows are maintained by anisotropic ( and inhomogeneous ) forcing .",
    "thus the principal conceptual model of turbulence , i.e.  homogeneous isotropic turbulence \" , exists only in theory .",
    "testing theoretical predictions that are derived on the basis of such a model in experimental flows ( or in simulations ) that are patently anisotropic can sometime lead to premature or erroneous conclusions about important issues like the universality of scaling exponents and other fundamental issues in the theory of turbulence .",
    "the justification for disregarding the effects of anisotropy was the old conjecture that in the limit of very high reynolds numbers and very small scales , local isotropy may be restored by the non - linear transfer mechanism that cascades energy from large to small scales . in the last decade",
    "there had been a number of observation that claimed the opposite @xcite . on the whole , these observations were based on measuring objects that  should vanish \" for isotropic flows , and observing their behavior as a function of reynolds number ( re ) or scale .",
    "thus for example objects made of the normal derivative of the downstream velocity components were examined : @xmath3 the pointed brackets denote ensemble average , @xmath4 is the streamwise component of the eulerian velocity field @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is in the spanwise direction .",
    "since such objects vanish in isotropic systems , their increase as a function of re were interpreted as a lack of restoration of local isotropy .",
    "the problem with such measures is that objects of this type are also sensitive to the phenomenon of intermittency , and also perfectly isotropic objects like @xmath7 increase with reynolds number .",
    "it is thus unclear what is the more important source of the observation that the objects ( [ skew ] ) do not vanish even when the reynolds number is increased .    until rather recently it was not obvious how to assess the anisotropic effects in a clear fashion , separating the contributions of the isotropic sector from the rest .",
    "starting with @xcite , it was proposed that one can do so usefully by finding systematically the projections of the measured correlation or structure functions on the irreducible representations of the so(3 ) group of all rotations .",
    "this approach was found useful in analyzing experimental results @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite . in the context of passive scalar and passive scalar advection it gave rise to a number of exact results @xcite . in its simplest form",
    "the projection is applied to the @xmath8th order structure functions ( with @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) : @xmath11^p\\rangle \\ .\\ ] ] such objects admit a relatively simple so(3 ) decomposition since they are scalar objects .",
    "we can thus span them by the usual spherical harmonics : @xmath12 in this equation we have used the indices @xmath13 to label , respectively , the total angular momentum and its projection along a reference axis , say @xmath14 .",
    "we are interested in particular in the scaling properties of the amplitudes @xmath15 , @xmath16 in the case of exactly soluble models @xcite it was found that the scaling exponents @xmath17 form a strictly increasing spectrum as a function of @xmath0 . in such cases",
    "it becomes completely clear that for @xmath18 , which in the limit re @xmath19 can still be in the inertial range , the higher order @xmath0 contributions disappear in favor of the isotropic contribution alone .",
    "thus if one can demonstrate the existence of a strictly increasing spectrum of exponents also in the context of the navier - stokes dynamics , one would establish that local isotropy is restored at the small scales when re @xmath19 ( i.e. when the viscous cut - off goes to zero ) .",
    "the numerical values of the scaling exponents will determine the rate ( in scales ) at which isotropy is restored .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present such a calculation .",
    "a calculation of the second order anisotropic exponents @xmath1 , based on the navier - stokes equations , was attempted before in @xcite .",
    "the analysis there concentrated on the _ forced _",
    "solutions for the second order structure function @xmath20 , and concluded with two sets of dimensional predictions .",
    "the first , assuming that the anisotropic forcing is analytic , reads @xmath21 the second forced solution was computed for non analytic forcing , resulting with @xmath22 another , more phenomenological approach , was presented in @xcite , generalizing an earlier argument by lumley @xcite . in this approach",
    "one does not balance the energy transfer against the forcing , but rather invokes the existence of a shear @xmath23 as the main reason for the anisotropy . performing dimensional analysis in which the shear is added to @xmath24 , the mean energy flux per unit time and mass ,",
    "one ends up with the prediction @xmath25 we note that for @xmath26 the predictions ( [ forcednot ] ) and ( [ shear ] ) coincide ; all three predictions disagree for @xmath27 .",
    "these predictions do not agree with the result of the only vector model with pressure that had been solved exactly , i.e. the  linear pressure model \" @xcite .",
    "this model captures some of the aspects of the pressure term in navier - stokes turbulence , while being linear and therefore much simpler problem .",
    "the non linearity of the navier - stokes equation is replaced by an advecting field @xmath28 and an advected field @xmath29 .",
    "the advecting field @xmath30 is taken with known dynamics and statistics .",
    "both fields are assumed incompressible .",
    "the equation of motion for the vector field @xmath31 is : @xmath32 in this equation , @xmath33 is a divergence free forcing term and @xmath34 the viscosity .",
    "the domain of the system is taken to be infinite .",
    "following kraichnan s model for passive scalar @xcite , the advecting field @xmath35 is chosen to be a white - noise gaussian process with a correlation function which is given by : @xmath36 \\ . \\label{defxi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the forcing @xmath37 is also taken to be a gaussian white noise process .",
    "its correlation function is @xmath38 the forcing is responsible for injecting energy and anisotropy to the system at an outer scale @xmath39 .",
    "we choose the tensor function @xmath40 to be analytic in @xmath41 , anisotropic , and vanishing rapidly for @xmath42 .",
    "to compare with the predictions ( [ forcedana ] ) and ( [ shear ] ) we should take @xmath43 in eq .",

    "the result of @xcite are the exponents @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in rather sharp disagreement with the predictions ( [ forcedana])([shear ] ) .",
    "we will see that the calculation presented below for the navier - stokes case comes up with results in close agreement with those of the linear pressure model .",
    "we thus will present a strong belief that the dimensional predictions ( [ forcedana])([shear ] ) fail to capture the correct results for the navier - stokes case .    in our approach",
    "we start from the navier - stokes equations , and write down an approximate equation satisfied by the second order correlation function , in the direct interaction approximation ( dia ) .",
    "this equation is nonlinear . for a weakly anisotropic system we can linearize the equation , to define a linear operator over the space of the anisotropic components of the second order correlation function .",
    "the solution is then a combination of forced solutions and  zero modes \" which are eigenfunctions of eigenvalue zero of the linear operator .",
    "the exponents of the forced solutions are identical to ( [ forcedana ] ) , but the exponents of the zero modes are smaller , and therefore leading with respect to former .",
    "the exponents ( [ forcednot ] ) are not physical , and are not observed in experiments or simulations .",
    "the exponents of the zero modes are close to ( [ shear ] ) for @xmath26 and 4 , but begin to deviate strongly for @xmath2 , falling very close to the predictions of the linear pressure model .",
    "we will argue that again the exponents of the zero modes are those that are observed in simulations .",

    "it is well known that there is no close - form theory for the second order simultaneous correlation function .",
    "we therefore need to resort to standard approximations that lead to model equations .",
    "an approach that is by now time - honored is kraichnan s dia , which leads to the approximate equation of motion @xmath62 where @xmath63 in this equation @xmath64 \\ , \\\\ ] ] and @xmath65 \\ . \\label{phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in stationary conditions and for @xmath61 in the inertial range we need to solve the integral equation @xmath66 .",
    "the process leading to these equations is long ; one starts with the dyson - wyld perturbation theory , and truncates ( without justification ) at the first loop order .",
    "in addition one asserts that the time dependence of the response function and the correlation functions are the same .",

    "it turns out that @xmath211 is practically independent of @xmath202 provided that @xmath212 , where : @xmath213 `` practically independent of '' means that the integrals change in this region of @xmath202 by an amount that is smaller than the minimum error of integration , ( and see next subsection for the estimate of this error ) .",
    "for @xmath214 the simple approximation for @xmath215 is not valid . for @xmath216",
    "the error of integration starts to grow rapidly .",
    "this is connected with high - order cancellations and finite machine precision .",
    "so , for @xmath2 we have a 4th - order cancellation , which means that any small error in the calculation ( or representation ) of the leading term will increase by the factor @xmath217 . the relative precision in presenting numbers on",
    "the machine is about @xmath218 , so for @xmath219 we have a principal ( machine ) relative error of about 0.1 , and , of course , the error of integration is increased here .      to perform the integration over @xmath157 we used a standard simpson integration rule which gives errors of the order @xmath220 ( here @xmath221 - integrand , @xmath222 - integration step ) .    performing the integration over @xmath163 we used a 9-point closed type newton - cotes integration formula with error of the order @xmath223 .",
    "we have to use such high - order integration formula because of high - order cancellation for @xmath188 and @xmath2 .",
    "simpler integration schemes amplify small relative errors in the integration of the leading terms ( which should cancel after angular integration ) causing great absolute errors for small @xmath157 .",
    "the precision of integration was estimated by integral recalculation with smaller step @xmath222 , and the error was determined as the maximal difference between the integrals , calculated with steps @xmath222 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the error in determining the scaling exponent was estimated as @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the accuracy of determining @xmath228 .",
    "we estimated @xmath229 in all cases .",
    "the determinants @xmath230 $ ] were computed as a function of the scaling exponents @xmath195 in every @xmath0-sector separately , and the scaling exponent was determined from the zero crossing .",
    "the procedure is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] for the isotropic sector @xmath231 .",
    "we expect for this sector @xmath232 , in accordance with @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , for both decay models , i.e the exponential decay ( [ expdecay ] ) , shown in dark line , and the gaussian decay ( [ gaussdecay ] ) shown in light line , the zero crossing occurs at the same point , which in the inset can be read as 3.6667 .      for the higher @xmath0-sectors",
    "the agreement between the exponential and gaussian models is not as perfect , indicating that our procedure is not exact . in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] we present the determinant and zero crossings for @xmath26 .      from the inset we can read the exponents @xmath233 and 4.366 for the exponential and gaussian models respectively .",
    "this is in correspondence with @xmath234 and 1.366 respectively .",
    "these numbers are in excellent correspondence with the experimental measurements reported in @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath188 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] . here",
    "the zero crossing , as seen in the inset , yields very close results for @xmath235 between the exponential and gaussian decay models , i.e. @xmath236 .",
    "note that this result is very close to the boundary of locality as discussed in subsect .",
    "[ locality ] . nevertheless the zero crossing is still easily resolved by the numerics , with the prediction that @xmath237 . we note that this number is well within the error bars of the simulational estimate of @xcite .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath2 , see fig .",
    ". also in this case exhibits zero crossing close to the boundary of locality , with @xmath238 .",
    "again we find close correspondence between the exponential and gaussian models . in terms of @xmath104",
    "this means @xmath239 .",
    "this number appears higher than the simulational result of @xcite , which estimated @xmath240 .",
    "we note however that for @xmath2 the log - log plots of @xcite scaled over less than half a decade , and improved simulations may well result in a substantial increase in the estimate .",
    "interestingly enough , the set of exponents @xmath1=2/3 , 1.36 , 1.99 and 3.98 for @xmath2410 , 2 , 4 and 6 respectively are in close agreement with the numbers obtained for the linear pressure model , @xmath1=2/3 , 1.25226 , 2.01922 , 4.04843 , for @xmath242 and 6 respectively .",
    "we reiterate at this point that the latter set is exact for the linear pressure model , whereas the former set is obtained within the dia approximation .",
    "nevertheless the close correspondence between the two leads us to propose that the actual exponents in the navier - stokes case must be very close to these predictions .",
    "we thus propose that careful experiments and simulations are likely to find the anisotropic exponents @xmath243 for all @xmath27 , with about 2/3 and 4/3 for @xmath231 and 2 respectively .",
    "if so , the restoration of isotropy at large re and small scales should be quite clear , with high @xmath0 contributions decaying very rapidly , and the @xmath26 contribution decaying with a gap exponent of about 2/3 .",
    "we do not expect a much more precise theoretical evaluation of these exponents before the intermittency problem in the isotropic sector is fully settled .",
