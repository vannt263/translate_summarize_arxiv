    "it was initially predicted by wigner that two - dimensional ( 2d ) electrons crystallize into a triangular lattice in the low density limit where the electron - electron interactions dominate over the kinetic energy . in an ideally clean 2d system , the critical @xmath2",
    "( @xmath3 , corresponding to the ratio of the coulomb energy scale u to the kinetic energy scale of the fermi energy @xmath4 ) was presented to be @xmath5 from quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the 2d plane can effectively localize electron wave functions while keeping the kinetic energy controlled@xcite .",
    "since this lessens the otherwise severe low - density condition , it is believed that the wigner crystal ( wc ) can be stabilized in a sufficiently strong magnetic field@xcite .",
    "approximate calculations@xcite have shown that the wc becomes the lowest energy state when the filling factor @xmath6 for the @xmath7 electron system and around @xmath8 for the hole system . since the impurities pin the electronic crystal , a domain structure forms in a realistic sample@xcite .",
    "while the electrons in a domain have an order as they are in the ideal crystal , the orientations of the domains are random .",
    "presently , the measurement in a tilted field has become an established technique to explore the various correlated properties in single layer as well as in double layers 2d electron systems @xcite . in a previous work@xcite ,",
    "we have compared the ground state energies of the generalized laughlin liquid @xcite to the electronic solid state at a given tilted angle .",
    "it was found that the critical filling factor @xmath9 at the solid - liquid transition increases with increasing tilted angle .    in this work",
    ", we will examine the relation of the orientation of the hexagonal wc with the in - plane magnetic field as well as the width of the 2d quantum well . in a wide quantum well",
    ", the electron wave function extends in the @xmath0-direction , hence may reduce the coulomb interactions . the in - plane field deforms the electron wave function , causing the interaction energy to vary according to the different patterns or orientations of the electronic crystals .",
    "we calculate the cohesive energy of the electronic crystal in a hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "we find that it becomes anisotropic in the tilted magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath1 $ ] axis of the hexagonal electronic crystal favors to align along the direction of the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "this trend of orientation stabilization is strengthened for larger tilted angles .",
    "it also shows that the energy difference between two orthogonal orientations of the electronic crystal increases with the width of the quantum well .",
    "the in - plane field favors the domains to orient to the same direction .",
    "thus , the effective impurity density is reduced as the field is tilted .",
    "we will discuss the possible consequence of such effect on the transport properties in the electronic solids .",
    "consider an electron moving on a @xmath10-@xmath11 plane under the influence of a strong magnetic field which is tilted an angle @xmath12 to the normal , with @xmath13 .",
    "the electron is confined in a harmonic potential @xmath14 in the @xmath0-direction , where @xmath15 is the band mass of the electron and @xmath16 the characteristic frequency .",
    "such a quantum well has been chosen to deal with many quantum hall systems@xcite to substitute the realistic potential which is either triangular or square .",
    "it was also used to discuss the giant magneto - resistance induced by a parallel magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we work in the `` landau gauge '' by choosing the vector potential @xmath17 .",
    "the single particle wave function for the lowest ll are : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnetic length and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is an integer multiple of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the harmonic oscillator wave function in the lowest energy level corresponding to the frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with the cyclotron frequency @xmath26 .",
    "the frequencies @xmath24 are given by@xcite @xmath27    the hamiltonian is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fourier transformation of the coulomb interaction .",
    "here @xmath30 is the in - plane momentum and @xmath31 is the momentum perpendicular to the quantum well .    from eq.([one ] ) , the electron density operator is expressed in the momentum space as @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",

    "@xmath36 , with @xmath37    substitute eq.([density ] ) into eq.([ham ] ) and carry out the usual procedure of the hf decoupling of the hamiltonian , we get @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the density of one completely filled ll and @xmath40 is the order parameter of the charge density wave ( cdw ) . the hf potential is denoted with @xmath41 .",
    "the hartree term @xmath42 is given by ( in units of @xmath43 ) @xmath44 ^ 2,\\ ] ] and the exchange term @xmath45 in the reciprocal space turns out to be proportional to the real - space hartree potential as,@xcite @xmath46    allowing the charge density wave by making ansatz in the plane @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the order parameter . the cohesive energy can be calculated in the same way as it has been done in refs .",

    "we choose @xmath59 , at which the ground state is a wigner crystal .",
    "figure 1 displays the dependence of the cohesive energy of the electronic crystal on the tilted angle @xmath12 for various orientation angles of the crystal to the in - plane magnetic field , where @xmath60 is the angle between one side of the hexagonal lattice with the in - plane field .",
    "it shows that of the two typical configurations of orientation with respect to the in - plane field : the @xmath61 $ ] and the @xmath1 $ ] , the energy is always lower for @xmath1 $ ] direction parallel to the in - plane field .",
    "the energy difference increases with the tilted angle . in fig.2",
    "we plot the relation of the cohesive energy of the hexagonal lattice with the characteristic frequency @xmath16 for tilted angles @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath1 $ ] direction is along the in - plane field for both curves .",
    "the smaller the characteristic frequency is , i.e. , the wider the quantum well is , the higher the cohesive energy .",
    "the in - plane magnetic field can lower the cohesive energy of the electronic crystal . from fig.2",
    "one can see that the energy difference becomes larger for wider quantum wells .",
    "our calculations show that when the tilted angle increases further , the energy difference will increase significantly , implying that the in - plane magnetic field stabilizes the orientation of the electronic crystal more effectively .",
    "pinning of the wigner crystal by impurities as a result of breaking of the translational invariance has been widely investigated@xcite .",
    "sherman@xcite had studied the angular pinning and the domain structure of the electronic crystal mediated by acoustic - phonon in @xmath64 semiconductor .",
    "our calculation shows that the in - plane magnetic field may serve as a tunable means to probe the orientation of the crystal .",
    "below we will explore the implications of the preferred orientation of the electronic crystal to the transport measurements .",
    "in realistic samples a domain structure is formed due to a finite impurity density .",
    "the electrons in each domain are ordered as they are in the crystal . in the absence of the in - plane field",
    ", each domain orients randomly , just like the domains in ferromagnets .",
    "an ideal electronic crystal is an insulator and the conductivity @xmath65@xcite .",
    "this thermal activation form of the conductivity implies that the electrons are hopping with a fixed range mechanism .",
    "it has been confirmed by experiments that @xmath66 is of the order 1k @xcite . in a realistic domain structure , however , the electrons may hop between the edges of the randomly oriented domains .",
    "since the experimental reachable temperature may be as low as 10mk , the variable range hopping mechanism may work in this temperature regime@xcite . in the following",
    ", we will discuss the possible consequence of the tilted field on the transport properties .    in the usual anderson localization",
    "the envelope of the wave function falls off exponentially as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the localization length . with a magnetic field",
    "the electronic wave function of a perfect system is essentially a gaussian as @xmath69 . in a slightly disordered system",
    "one can think that some of the states will be pinned at certain isolated impurity sites .",
    "the mixing of these states due to quantum - mechanical tunnelling leads to a simple exponential tail in the wave function@xcite . in a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the electrons condense into a crystal at lower filling factors .",
    "when the temperature is high enough the transport is of the thermal activation form , which implies that the electrons are hopping with a fixed range mechanism@xcite .",
    "the hopping range is determined by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the impurity density .",
    "however , localized states may exist along the edges of the domains of the electronic crystal because of the impurities . when the temperature is sufficiently low such that there is nearly no phonon with energy to assist the electron making the nearest hopping , mott s variable hopping mechanism@xcite allows the electrons hop a larger distance @xmath72 to a state which has a smaller energy difference @xmath73 . in turn , the hopping conduction is determined by the typical decay rate of the tails of the wave function .",
    "the hopping probability is then given by @xmath74 , \\label{prb}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the activation energy .",
    "as in the quantum hall effect regime , strong interaction between electrons leads to the system condensing into a wc .",
    "the coulomb gap depresses the density of states near the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "efros _ et al",
    "_ @xcite had derived the density of states near the fermi surface @xmath77 where @xmath78^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the characteristic temperature @xmath79 above which the fixed range hopping dominates is determined by @xmath80 , namely @xmath81    now , we discuss the possible effect of the tilted field . as we have discussed , the existence of an in - plane field deforms the electron wave function .",
    "however , this wave function deformation does not qualitatively change the electron hopping mechanism at a given temperature .",
    "the major effect of the tilted field would be on the variation of @xmath79 .",
    "as we have shown , the in - plane field lowers the cohesive energy of the wigner crystal and forces the domains align to the same direction .",
    "thus , the role of the in - plane field is to integrate the domains into larger ones . in this way",
    ", the in - plane field causes some of impurities to be irrelevant and therefore reduces the effective impurity density . to determine @xmath79 from ( [ t0 ] )",
    ", only the relevant impurities should be counted in .",
    "hence , one can replace @xmath71 by an effective impurity density @xmath82 . from eq.([t0 ] ) , we see that @xmath79 is sensitive to @xmath82 . in a strong magnetic field",
    "the decay length is comparable to the cyclotron radius @xmath83@xcite . for a sample with @xmath84@xmath85 , we estimate @xmath86 mk .",
    "this temperature is experimentally reachable .",
    "therefore , it is possible to observe a change of transport behavior that displays a crossover from the variable to the fixed range hopping under proper parameters and temperature as the tilted angle rises .",
    "we have shown that the wc has a preferred orientation with respect to the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "we argued that there are domains in a realistic sample and predicted that the temperature dependence of the transport behavior may be different in different temperature regime .",
    "moreover , we emphasized that this preferred orientation of the crystal may lead to an in - plane field induced crossover from the variable range hopping to the fixed range hopping of the transport mechanism in the 2d electronic solid .",
    "we expect future experiments to verify our prediction .",
