    "last week , a new solution to type  iib supergravity was presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "it beautifully clarified and considerably generalised the structure of an already interesting family of supergravity solutions presented in ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite . )",
    "those earlier supergravity solutions are asymptotic to the maximally supersymmetric ads@xmath5 solution , and  the ads / cft correspondence@xcite , and generalisations thereof , represent `` holographic renormalisation group flow''@xcite of the four dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric pure yang ",
    "mills theory to @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theory with a massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of @xmath2 , in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "these new , more general solutions preserve the same supersymmetries , and are also believed to represent the same type of physics .    in this short note we carry out a study in the spirit of refs.@xcite .",
    "there were puzzling singularities in the supergravity solutions of ref.@xcite obscuring the gauge theory interpretation considerably@xcite .",
    "the idea was to probe the geometry with the most natural object to hand one of the constituent d3branes in an effort to determine the correct physics . this had borne considerable fruit in a study reported in ref.@xcite , where the nature of the singular behaviour was understood , unphysical singularities were removed , and the new phenomenon called the `` enhanon mechanism '' proved to be well adapted to the task of clarifying the physics . as the situation in ref.@xcite preserved the same supersymmetries as the geometries under discussion in ref.@xcite ( where in fact the motivation was also to find gauge duals of @xmath1 four dimensional gauge theory ) , it was very natural to bring the same tools to understanding the geometries of ref.@xcite .",
    "those studies were successful , and in light of the existence of the more general class of solutions presented recently in ref.@xcite , it is natural to carry out the same study here .",
    "we probe the geometries and derive the effective lagrangian for the general form of solutions in section  [ sec : proberesult ] .",
    "the detailed form of a solution is seeded by a non  linear differential equation which yields a single function@xcite .",
    "this is a difficult equation , and so far only two families of solution are known .",
    "the first is the previously known family@xcite . in section  [ sec : specialize ] , as a review and for contrast , we specialise our result to that case , and recover the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "we particularly follow the lines of ref.@xcite in moving away from the natural supergravity coordinates and finding new coordinates on the moduli space that are adapted to the full discussion of the low energy effective lagrangian of the @xmath1 gauge theory . in particular , in the spirit of ref.@xcite ,",
    "ref.@xcite exhibited explicit holomorphy and identified in the new coordinates the locations of the points where there are singularities in the gauge coupling .    in section  [ anotherexample ]",
    "we carry out a similar analysis for the second family of exact solutions to the differential equation exhibited in ref.@xcite . whilst the solution is very different from the earlier one",
    ", we find that once we have identified the natural coordinates , the locus of singular points is controlled by a very similar functional dependence as in the previous example : there is a dense locus of singular points on a straight line segment controlled by an ( inverse ) square root branch cut in the complex coupling @xmath6 .",
    "we find this simplicity to be intriguing , and suggestive of a universality that it would be interesting to prove .",
    "the universality itself is in line with a conjecture made some time ago about the existence of a much simpler model which might underlie the physics@xcite : some of the gross features are similar to a reduced dynamical model such as a large @xmath3 matrix model or integrable system related to the calogero  moser model at large @xmath3 .",
    "we discuss some of these ideas and features in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we first present the complete solution of ref.@xcite .",
    "the einstein frame metric is : @xmath7+h_1^{-1}u^2\\sigma_1 ^ 2 + h_2dv^2+h_2^{-1}v^2d\\phi^2\\right\\}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a constant , and @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( and cyclic permutations ) define the left invariant maurer ",
    "cartan forms on @xmath11 , and note that : @xmath12 the other supergravity fields of relevance here are the axion  dilaton fields and the r",
    " r four  form potential .",
    "these are given as : @xmath13 where by setting @xmath14 we have set the asymptotic value of the dilaton and the r ",
    "r scalar @xmath15 in terms of the string coupling @xmath16 and the constant @xmath17 .",
    "these in turn set the asymptotic yang ",
    "mills coupling ( @xmath18 ) and the theta angle in the @xmath2 gauge theory on the d3branes to which this geometry is holographically dual at large @xmath3 .",
    "we also note here that the solution has been presented with the natural length scale , @xmath19 , of the spacetime , set to unity .",
    "it is given in terms of the string tension , string coupling , and @xmath3 ( the number of branes sourcing the geometry ) as @xmath20 .",
    "this can easily be restored as needed .    for completeness",
    ", we also note that the three  form field strength @xmath21 is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 with @xmath24 as we shall see , we will not need these fields in the study presented here .",
    "the remarkable thing about this large class of solutions is that it is seeded entirely by the function @xmath25 , which is obtained as a solution to the following non  linear differential equation : @xmath26    this equation is very difficult to solve exactly , and only two classes of exact solutions ( those which we study here ) are known at present .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that a perturbative study can reveal some structures that might be of use for either searching for exact solutions or for seeding numerical studies .",
    "the point is that ( as suggested in ref.@xcite ) one can write @xmath27 and attempt to determine the functions @xmath28 from the resulting linearised equations .",
    "this is an interesting line of attack that we have not carried out in great detail so far . at first order",
    "we have noticed that if we separate variables according to @xmath29 , then @xmath30 and @xmath31 both satisfy relations of the form of bessel s equation . this may be a clue for further study .",
    "in the time  honoured fashion , we will probe the supergravity solution of the previous section with a d3brane , whose world ",
    "volume action is : @xmath32+\\mu_3\\int_{\\cal m } c_{(4)}\\ ,    { \\label{action}}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and the spacetime fields are pulled back  the map @xmath34 according to : @xmath35 the d3brane will be chosen as lying in the directions @xmath36 , and so the `` static gauge '' will be chosen so as to respectively align the world ",
    "volume coordinates @xmath37 with the spacetime coordinates , and the remaining transverse coordinates , denoted generically @xmath38 , will be taken to be functions , @xmath39 , of @xmath40 , allowing for the brane s motion .",
    "we keep only terms quadratic in all velocities , looking to stay in the bps limit in the directions where this is possible .",
    "this computation is quite standard@xcite , and so we just state the result here with no further elaboration .",
    "we obtain an effective lagrangian for a point particle moving in the six transverse coordinates @xmath41 , where : @xmath42+h_1^{-1}u^2{\\dot \\sigma}_1 ^ 2 + h_2{\\dot v}^2+h_2^{-1}v^2{\\dot \\phi}^2\\right\\}\\ ,",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ v&=&\\frac{\\mu_3 k^4}{g_s}\\omega^4\\left(1-\\cos\\beta\\right)=\\frac{\\mu_3 k^4}{g_s}\\left(\\frac{u^2}{h_1 + 1}\\right)\\ .    { \\label{proberesult}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "it is instructive to first obtain a few known results . the solution of ref.@xcite can be recovered by choosing new coordinates @xmath43 , and a function @xmath44 such that @xmath45 where the function @xmath44 is related to @xmath46 in the following way : @xmath47\\ , \\ ] ] for a real number @xmath48 , which parameterises a whole family of solutions .",
    "it is very useful to examine the behaviour of the families by looking at figure  [ families ] . the functions @xmath49 plotted there are related to the functions @xmath50 by @xmath51 .",
    "the function @xmath52 determines the mass of the adjoint hypermultiplet in the @xmath1 gauge theory that results from the soft breaking of the pure @xmath0 theory .",
    "in fact , the mass is related to the constant @xmath8 in the solution by@xcite @xmath53 .",
    "the function @xmath54 sets the vacuum expectation of the remaining @xmath1 complex scalar in the gauge multiplet .",
    "the left hand side represents the ultraviolet ( uv ) : the @xmath0 theory with these scalars and hence the coefficients of the operators to which they correspond switched off . as we flow to the right the scalars switch on .",
    "this corresponds to the mass and the vev in the gauge theory increasing as we flow to the infrared ( ir ) . notice that for @xmath55 , the cases running to @xmath56 all define a particular finite value of @xmath46 , which we shall denote @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath58 this value of @xmath57 diverges .",
    "equations  ( [ special ] ) give @xmath59 which can be used to eliminate @xmath44 . the resulting equation , after differentiating with respect to @xmath60 and to @xmath61 , removing @xmath48 , gives a pair of equations for @xmath62 and @xmath63 that imply the non  linear differential equation  ( [ thediffy ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath64 can be written as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 and so the potential becomes @xmath68\\ , \\ ] ] and so there are two separate branches to the moduli space , where the potential vanishes : either @xmath56 or @xmath69 .",
    "the latter condition is simply @xmath70 .    in both branches",
    "the moduli space is two dimensional , as appropriate to the fact that we are looking at the moduli space of a single complex scalar component that breaks the @xmath2 to @xmath71 , achieved by pulling a single brane away from the collection of the other branes .",
    "for the first branch ( which only exists for @xmath55 ) the coordinates are @xmath72 and the metric on that space is@xcite @xmath73 after changing variables  @xmath74 , this can also be written as : @xmath75 the parameter @xmath76 s maximum value is unity , marking the edge of a disc , which is where @xmath70 .",
    "this edge precisely matches onto the second branch for which @xmath70 everywhere . the natural coordinates on this other branch are @xmath77 and the metric is@xcite : @xmath78 our interest is the vanishing of the metric , corresponding to where singularities on the coulomb branch appear .",
    "this occurs when @xmath46 diverges , which happens for @xmath79 .",
    "the key piece of physics to identify is the location of this singular behaviour in terms of variables that are correctly adapted to the @xmath1 gauge theory discussion@xcite . to find these it is natural@xcite to first find coordinates @xmath80 that make the metric conformal to flat space @xmath81 : @xmath82 the metric is now : @xmath83 next",
    ", we must find a coordinate change to a new coordinate @xmath84 such that the metric is : @xmath85    the coordinate @xmath84 is to represent the vacuum expectation value of the scalar in the gauge multiplet whose moduli space we are examining .",
    "the prefactor is the same as the one which appears in front of the kinetic term for the gauge field , and so determines the appropriate coordinates to use .",
    "the dilaton can be determined from equations  ( [ morefields ] ) to be : @xmath86 writing @xmath87 we have @xmath88 where in the last line we have used repeatedly that @xmath80 and that @xmath89 .",
    "so finally we have the elegant result : @xmath90 it is in terms of the quantity @xmath84 we should look for the non  trivial behaviour of the coupling . to that end , we compute @xmath91 . using that @xmath92 ( from equation  ( [ cosbeta ] ) )",
    ", we have from equations  ( [ tendee ] ) and  ( [ morefields ] ) that @xmath93 , and hence ( setting @xmath94 ) : @xmath95 so finally we conclude that there is a singular locus of points where the gauge coupling diverges on the complex @xmath84 plane .",
    "it is given by the location of the square root branch cut in the function  ( [ tau ] ) , and is the large @xmath3 analogue of the seiberg ",
    "witten singular locus for this particular branch of the @xmath1 supersymmetric @xmath2 gauge theory with massive adjoint hypermultiplet of mass @xmath96 .",
    "we will discuss this further in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in ref.@xcite , where the new , more general solution ( displayed in section  [ sec : solution ] ) was presented , a very simple solution to the differential equation  ( [ thediffy ] ) that seeds the solution was discovered .",
    "this represents a new slice of the coulomb branch , and we should use the techniques we have been studying to examine it .",
    "we can simply specialise our results for the probe computation , and attempt to carry out some of the analysis of the previous section .",
    "the solution is described as `` separable '' , since each half of the non  linear differential equation  ( [ thediffy ] ) is identically zero : @xmath97 for @xmath98 arbitrary real constants , which gives : @xmath99 after substitution , the potential is : @xmath100 now , matching to the asymptotic value of @xmath46 requires that @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "inserting these ( the first is enough in fact ) shows that there is only one branch for the moduli space , which is @xmath103 .",
    "the moduli space is again two dimensional , as expected , and the metric is : @xmath104 where we have taken @xmath105 to mean its positive part and hence written the two choices of sign we can have in the metric .",
    "we must now find the natural @xmath1 coordinates .",
    "first we write , taking the plus sign ( we will deal with the minus case later ) : @xmath106 for some new radial coordinate we must find , @xmath107 . after some algebra , we find : @xmath108 and so noting the useful relations @xmath109 our metric is : @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "again , we must match this to the form given in equation  ( [ canonical ] ) .",
    "this time , we can read off the dilaton from the supergravity solution as : @xmath112 our crucial equation is now : @xmath113 where we have used repeatedly that @xmath111 .",
    "it is pleasing that there is a such a simple result , and interesting that although the details seem very different from the example in the previous section , it gives precisely the same form for the change of variables : @xmath114 since @xmath115 can be written simply as @xmath116 , once again the algebra simplifies marvellously , and we get the result that @xmath93 ; and therefore the result for the gauge coupling in the natural @xmath1 adapted complex @xmath84 plane is : @xmath117 we have recovered the possibility of the other sign for @xmath105 .",
    "we see that it naturally connects onto the plus sign case as follows : there is again a square root branch cut of width set now by @xmath118 , and it lies on the real axis for the plus sign choice ( corresponding to the minus in the expression immediately above ) .",
    "as @xmath105 goes to zero , @xmath46 becomes constant everywhere , and we return to the boring @xmath119 result .",
    "this can be seen by examining the solution for @xmath46 given in expression  ( [ newsolution ] ) ( with , recall , @xmath101 and @xmath103 to be on the moduli space , or alternatively @xmath102 to be asymptotically constant ) . on the @xmath84plane this corresponds to the cut shrinking to zero size and disappearing , with @xmath6 becoming a constant , @xmath120 . as @xmath105 continues to the other sign however , the cut simply reappears , but aligned along the imaginary axis .",
    "it is intriguing that the results of the previous section for the new solution also give such a clean outcome in the natural @xmath1 coordinates .",
    "there is the same form as in section  [ sec : specialize ] for the singular locus where the gauge coupling @xmath6 diverges .",
    "this is a special piece of the moduli space of the full gauge theory .",
    "generically , it is to be expected that there are of order @xmath3 singular points on the coulomb branch , and there ought to be nothing special about their arrangement for any @xmath3 .",
    "gravity and string duals of the gauge theory at large @xmath3 suggest the existence of very special large @xmath3 limits where these singular points coalesce into a one  dimensional locus .",
    "this locus has a stringy and supergravity understanding as the `` enhanon '' locus of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is associated with the place where d3branes ( in this example ) , which would be pointlike in the relevant transverse space , become tensionless and smear out transversely to fill out a one  dimensional ( in this example ) submanifold densely .    in gauge theory terms",
    ", the large @xmath3 theory is a special limit in which , away from the singular points , the generic instanton corrections to the form of the coupling are suppressed ( due to @xmath3 being large ) ; but then they switch on strongly at short separation , spreading the points into the singular locus@xcite .",
    "as we have seen from the probe results , once we get to the right @xmath1 adapted coordinates the loci seem to be controlled by a very simple structure .",
    "although we have only seen two classes of exact solution for which this can be demonstrated explicitly , they seem so different in the details but yet yield so similar a final form that it is natural to conjecture that this simple structure will persist : the ( inverse ) square root branch cut form will perhaps always control the location of the locus in this large class of examples given by the supergravity solution in section  [ sec : solution ] .",
    "we expect that what will distinguish the details on the coulomb branch is probably only two features : _",
    "( 1 ) _ the number of distinct such cuts or segments that can appear in the plane we can imagine multi  cut situations and _ ( 2 ) _ the detailed distribution of smeared d3branes within each cut",
    ". this will be determined by functions @xmath121 that will give the d3brane density in the @xmath122th segment on the complex @xmath84plane .",
    "these details are implicit in the precise functional dependence of @xmath25 , which translates into a specific relation between the mass and the choice of the precise pattern of vacuum expectation values breaking @xmath2 to @xmath123 ( corresponding in the dual theory to pulling off a single d3brane from the group of @xmath3 ) .",
    "perhaps a study along the lines of ref.@xcite could be carried out for new examples to determine the density distributions .",
    "notice that , in the example reviewed in section  [ sec : specialize ] , the density function extracted in ref.@xcite was @xmath124 , which is in fact a semi  circle .",
    "there are a number of suggestive features here , which support a conjecture made some time ago@xcite about the presumed underlying simplicity of the physics in question .",
    "the conjecture is that there is a reduced model appearing at large  @xmath3 that controls the physics : there may be a matrix model ( or closely related integrable model ) of some variety responsible for these broad features .",
    "such models at large @xmath3 are known to have exactly the attributes required : _ ( 1 ) _ they have simple distributions of eigenvalues or charges , given by density functions @xmath121 ( often of wigner s semi  circle type ) , sometimes with support on a number of disconnected segments ( labelled @xmath122 here ) described in terms of square root branch cuts in the plane . _",
    "( 2 ) _ many details of any additional potentials these models might have are irrelevant at strictly large @xmath3 , and so they often fall into simple universality classes .",
    "the same universality may be at work here . _",
    "( 3 ) _ such models are often associated with non  linear differential equations .",
    "perhaps the equation  ( [ thediffy ] ) , seeding the entire class of supergravity solutions , may have its origins in the context of these simpler models .",
    "the matrix model is expected to be closely related to the calogero ",
    "moser system .",
    "the reasons for this expectation are circumstantial , but worth mentioning .",
    "the point is that , at any @xmath3 , the calogero ",
    "moser model has been shown to share the same formal data as the seiberg ",
    "witten solution for the associated @xmath2 gauge theory@xcite .",
    "in particular , the seiberg  witten curve is essentially the spectral curve of the integrable system defined by the calogero  moser model . the seiberg ",
    "witten curve of course encodes the physics of the coulomb branch of the gauge theory and , in particular , its points of degeneration give the places where the gauge coupling diverges .",
    "the idea@xcite would be that at large @xmath3 this relation becomes more than formal : the dynamics may have their _ best _ description in terms of the variables of the integrable model .",
    "it is also of note that the calogero  moser model ( in some limits ) can be derived from a simple matrix model@xcite , and that at large @xmath3 the distribution of the interacting charges ( the eigenvalues ) in the model is again wigner s semi  circle distribution on the line@xcite .",
    "the description of the @xmath125 corrections may then have their home in familiar matrix model and integrable system technology ( see also ref.@xcite for related work which may support some of these ideas ) .",
    "this is very natural also from the point of view of branes , of course .",
    "branes have come to be recognised as having more than a passing resemblance to eigenvalues in some type of matrix model , and this context would be one way to make that precise .",
    "this was part of the motivation for the conjecture in ref.@xcite ; the idea was to find effective models of the enhanon locus as a dynamical object in its own right .",
    "the constituent branes have become tensionless and , furthermore , @xmath3 of them have coalesced into a single unit and so their description in the usual terms is difficult .",
    "the expectation was that the sought ",
    "after matrix model would be a new collective description of the enhanon . this hope remains .",
    "although the idea seemed somewhat far  fetched at the time , the results presented here together with the new excitement about matrix models relevance to four dimensional gauge theory@xcite suggest that there may be hope to find such a model .",
