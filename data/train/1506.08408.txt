    "drawdowns relate to an investor s sustained loss from a market peak .",
    "it is one of the most frequently quoted indices for downside risks in the fund management industry .",
    "drawdown quantities appear in performance measures such as the calmar ratio , the sterling ratio , the burke ratio , and others ; see , for example , schuhmacher and eling @xcite for a collection of such drawdown - based performance measures .",
    "furthermore , drawdown problems have drawn considerable theoretical and practical interest in various research areas including probability , finance , risk management , and statistics ; see section  [ sec1.1 ] for a brief literature review .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a one - dimensional lvy process @xmath1 defined on @xmath2 , a filtered probability space satisfying the usual conditions .",
    "the drawdown process of @xmath3 is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the running maximum ( historical peak ) of @xmath3 at time @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the first time the magnitude of drawdowns exceeds a pre - specified threshold @xmath8 .",
    "given that @xmath9 @xmath10-a.s .",
    ", the distributional study of the maximum drawdown in magnitude is equivalent to the study of the stopping time @xmath11 .",
    "however , from a risk management standpoint , the magnitude itself is not sufficient to provide a comprehensive risk evaluation of extreme drawdown risks .",
    "for instance , for extreme risks such as tornado and flooding , it is natural to also investigate the frequency and the duration of drawdowns .",
    "_ @xcite recently studied the frequency of drawdowns for a brownian motion process by defining two types of drawdown time sequences depending on whether a historical running maximum is reset or not . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the duration of drawdowns , also known as `` time to recover '' ( ttr ) the historic running maximum in the fund management industry .",
    "mathematically , the duration of drawdowns of a stochastic process can be considered as the length of excursions from its running maximum . for @xmath12 ,",
    "let @xmath13 be the last time the process @xmath14 is at level @xmath15 ( or equivalently @xmath16 ) before or at time @xmath6 .",
    "the drawdown duration at time @xmath6 is therefore @xmath17 .",
    "we then define a stopping time @xmath18 that is the first time the duration of drawdowns exceeds a pre - specified time threshold @xmath19 .",
    "equivalently , the event @xmath20 implies that the maximum duration of drawdowns before time @xmath6 is shorter than @xmath21 .",
    "the stopping time @xmath22 is related to the so - called parisian time , which is the first time the length of excursions from a fixed spatial level ( rather than its running maximum ) exceeds a pre - specified time threshold ; see , for example , chesney _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and czarna and palmowski @xcite .",
    "further , loeffen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite provided an unified proof to derive the probability that the parisian time occurs in an infinite time horizon ( known as the parisian ruin probability in actuarial science ) for spectrally negative lvy processes .",
    "notice that , in contrast to the parisian time , the stopping time @xmath22 is almost surely finite ( e.g. , page 105 of bertoin @xcite ) , which motivates us to study the laplace transform ( lt ) of @xmath22 in this paper .",
    "another related concept is the so - called red period of the insurance surplus process ; see kyprianou and palmowski @xcite .",
    "the red period corresponds to the length of time an insurance surplus process shall take to recover its deficit at ruin .",
    "but it is different than the distributional study of @xmath22 , especially when @xmath3 has no negative jumps ( e.g. , brownian motion ) .",
    "taylor @xcite first derived the joint laplace transform of @xmath23 and @xmath24 for brownian motion processes .",
    "later on , it was generalized by lehoczky @xcite to time - homogeneous diffusion processes .",
    "_ @xcite and magdon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite derived infinite series expansions for the distribution of @xmath11 for a standard and drifted brownian motion , respectively . for",
    "spectrally negative lvy processes , mijatovi and pistorius  @xcite obtained a general sextuple formula for the joint laplace transform of @xmath11 and the last passage time at level @xmath24 prior to @xmath11 , together with the joint distribution of the running maximum , the running minimum , and the overshoot of @xmath14 at @xmath11 .",
    "also , an extensive body of literature exists on the dual of drawdowns , drawups , which measure the increase in value of an underlying process from its running minimum ; see , for instance , pistorius @xcite , hadjiliadis and vee @xcite , pospisil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and zhang and hadjiliadis @xcite .    in finance and risk management ,",
    "researchers have devoted considerable effort in assessing , managing , and reducing drawdown risks .",
    "for instance , grossman and zhou @xcite examined a portfolio selection problem subject to drawdown constraints .",
    "cvitanic and karatzas @xcite extended the discussion to multiple assets .",
    "@xcite proposed a new family of risk measures and studied problems of parameter selection and portfolio optimization under the new measures .",
    "pospisil and vee @xcite invented a new class of greeks to examine the sensitivity of investment portfolios to drawdowns .",
    "_ @xcite designed some european - style digital drawdown insurance contracts and proposed semi - static hedging strategies using barrier options and vanilla options .",
    "other recent works on drawdown insurance are zhang _",
    "_ @xcite , among others .",
    "in addition , a few a priori unrelated problems in finance and insurance are also closely connected to the drawdown problematic .",
    "for instance , the pricing of russian options ( e.g. , shepp and shiryaev @xcite , asmussen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and avram _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , and the optimal dividend models with `` reflecting barriers '' ( e.g. , avram et al .",
    "@xcite , kyprianou and palmowski @xcite , and loeffen  @xcite ) are two common examples .      in this article , we begin by developing an approximation technique in the spirit of lehoczky @xcite to revisit several known lt results on the magnitude of drawdowns of spectrally negative lvy processes via basic fluctuation identities .",
    "second , as the threshold of drawdown magnitude @xmath25 , we examine the asymptotic behavior of those lts for any spectrally negative lvy process whose scale functions are well - behaved at @xmath0 ( see assumption  [ assume1 ] below ) .",
    "we also show that such asymptotics are robust with respect to the perturbation of arbitrary positive compound poisson jumps , and hence obtain the asymptotics of drawdown estimates for a class of lvy models with two - sided jumps .",
    "finally , we study the duration of drawdowns via the lt of @xmath22 .",
    "first , an approximate scheme for the lt of @xmath22 is developed . to obtain a well - defined limit",
    ", we turn our problem to the behavior of the density of the running maximum process @xmath26 and the convergence of some potential measure of the drawdown process @xmath14 .",
    "thanks to the asymptotic results obtained and some recent works on the distribution of the running maxima of lvy processes ( e.g. , chaumont @xcite , chaumont and maecki @xcite , and kwanicki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , we obtain the law of @xmath22 in terms of the right tail of the ascending ladder time process for a class of lvy process with two - sided jumps ( a general spectrally negative part plus a positive compound poisson structure ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : pre ] , we review the scale function of spectrally negative lvy processes and the ascending ladder process of a general lvy process . in section  [ sec : mag ] , we revisit some known lt results on the magnitude of drawdowns of spectrally negative lvy processes based on an approximation approach . the asymptotic behavior of these lts for small threshold is studied in section  [ sec : asym ] , where we also examine the asymptotic behavior in the presence of positive compound poisson jumps . in section  [ sec : ddd ] , the lt of @xmath22 is derived for a large class of lvy processes with two - sided jumps .",
