    "during recent years great progress has been made in the development of experimental tools for study of optical properties of single dot structures@xcite : confocal microscopy and near field scanning microscopy have been particularly useful .",
    "self - assembled quantum dots(saqds ) are promising as single photon generators@xcite because of the high optical quality of the resulting dot structures .",
    "photons may be generated from states formed by a number of electrons and holes , i.e. , multiexcitons@xcite .",
    "fine structures of excitons , biexcitons , and triexcitons have been studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "exact numerical diagonalization and quantum monte carlo studies of emission spectra of multiexciton states have been performed for several different shapes of saqds@xcite .",
    "the emission spectra of bose - einstein condensed magnetoexcitons in the strong magnetic field limit have been also investigated theoretically in saqds@xcite .",
    "however , the polarization dependence of the emission spectra of multiexcitons in quantum dots is not well understood . in one- ,",
    "two- , and three - dimensional electron - hole plasmas with parabolic bands the ratio between the emission intensities for linear and circular polarizations is constant since their optical strengths are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , see table [ table : polarizationmat ] . ( the constant @xmath2 is the dipole matrix element @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the bloch wave functions )",
    "this is because the independent quasi - particle picture holds in these systems and each single particle state is always doubly spin degenerate .",
    "however , in zero - dimensional quantum dots this may not be the case since single particle levels are discrete and many body effects are strong , see figs .",
    "[ fig : bandgap ] and [ fig : n2.to.n1 ] .",
    "it is unclear to what extent the independent quasi - particle picture holds .",
    "a simple example demonstrates that there may be some polarization dependence .",
    "the emission from the s - shells is simple to analyse and shows that the emission spectra for linear and circular polarizations are _ not _ proportional , see fig .",
    "[ fig : n2.to.n1 ] .",
    "this is because for @xmath6 and linear polarization the initial state of the optical transitions is non - degenerate while the final states are doubly _ degenerate_.",
    "this means that the emission strength doubles from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "we investigate polarization dependence of the emission spectra of a quantum dot when a photon is generated by the recombination of an electron - hole pair in the p - shells , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bandgap ] . in this case",
    "the polarization dependence of the emission spectra is expected to be more complicated since many body states can be strongly correlated .",
    "our results demonstrate that the optical strength can depend sensitively on the polarization state of the emitted photon .",
    "the optical strength can be enhanced significantly if there are several degenerate multiexciton final states .",
    "in addition the optical strength can take different values depending on which degenerate initial state of the optical transition is occupied .",
    "the emission spectra are calculated using these optical strengths , and are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : linear ] and [ fig : circular ] .",
    "the emission intensities are almost independent of the strength of the coulomb interactions in our model , although the transition energies do depend on the coulomb interactions . in the presence of electron - hole symmetry",
    "the independence is exact .",
    "our results may be useful since they could provide an important qualitative result that must be valid in a more general approximation .",
    ".transition matrix elements between a heavy hole and an electron for different polarizations .",
    "note that a hole is the absence of a valence electron , and its spin takes the opposite value of the valence electron . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this paper we consider linearly , right circularly , and left circularly polarized photons .",
    "we assume fast energy relaxation so that only emission from ground states of @xmath7 exciton pairs are needed .",
    "the emission spectrum is given by @xmath8 where the luminescence operator is @xmath9 an electron and a hole can only recombine when they have opposite values of the z - component of angular momenta and spins .",
    "this leads to the _ selection rules _ @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the optical dipole strength from a ground state of n - exciton system , @xmath12 , to a ground / excited state of ( n-1)-exciton system , @xmath13 , is @xmath14 .",
    "the possible values of the optical dipole strength are displayed in table [ table : values ] . in our model",
    "there are only three types of dipole transitions : ( a ) transitions between single and two - basis states , ( b ) transitions between two - basis states , and ( c ) transitions between two- and six - basis states .",
    "we have computed emission spectra for polarization along the x - axis ( @xmath15 ) , left circular polarization ( @xmath16 ) , and right circular polarization ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "they are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : linear ] and [ fig : circular ] .",
    "the following parameters are used : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21",
    ". in our calculation we measure energy with respect to the coulomb energy @xmath22 .",
    "note that the transition energy is actually @xmath23 , but we will drop the bandgap energy @xmath24 for convenience hereafter . the emission spectra for right and left circular polarizations are identical . note that only one transition energy is possible when @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "this is because transitions from the ground state of @xmath28 to the excited states of @xmath29 , and from the ground state of @xmath30 to the excited states of @xmath31 are optically forbidden or vanish .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath32 three transition energies are possible .",
    "one can show that the excited states @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the hilbert subspace @xmath36 for @xmath30 do not contribute to optical strengths ( see appendix a ) .",
    "only @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 contribute .",
    "let us discuss the emission spectra of @xmath40 for @xmath15 .",
    "the oscillator strength of the lowest energy peak @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "it originates from the transitions @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] ( these are defined as type a transitions ) .",
    "the _ subscript _",
    "@xmath44 in @xmath45 indicates that it is the lowest energy eigenstate .",
    "this oscillator strength is negligible compared to those of the others .",
    "the oscillator strength of the next lowest transition energy @xmath46 is @xmath47 .",
    "it originates from the transitions @xmath48 ( these are defined as type b transitions ) .",
    "the dependence of the strength of this peak on the ratio @xmath49 is negligible : as it is reduced from @xmath50 to @xmath51 the oscillator strength changes smoothly from @xmath47 to @xmath52 ( the change is only about @xmath53 ) . the dependence on the coulomb interactions ,",
    "i.e. , on the ratio @xmath54 is also negligible : as it is reduced from @xmath55 to @xmath56 the oscillator strength reduces continuously from @xmath47 to @xmath57 .",
    "as these parameters change the sum of the two oscillator strengths of transitions a and b remains a constant equal to @xmath58 .",
    "this is _ evidence _ that our calculations are correct .",
    "the highest peak with the energy @xmath59 has the optical strength @xmath60 and originates from the transitions @xmath61 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] . in these transitions",
    "there are two possible final states with the same energy , and the oscillator strength is the sum of the two contributions .",
    "the other peak at the same transition energy with the strength @xmath1 originates from the transitions @xmath62 . note that some transition energies can have more than one optical strengths .",
    "for example , for @xmath63 at the transition energy @xmath64 two values of optical strengths @xmath1 and @xmath65 are possible . in this case there are two different initial states giving rise to the same value of the optical strength @xmath1 . the same is also true for @xmath65 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : linear ] .",
    "now we discuss the emission spectra for @xmath17 for the case @xmath32 .",
    "the oscillator strength of the lowest energy peak @xmath41 is @xmath66 .",
    "it originates from the transition @xmath67 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] ( we define it as type c transition ) .",
    "this oscillator strength is negligible compared to those of the others .",
    "the oscillator strength of the next lowest energy peak @xmath46 is @xmath68 .",
    "it originates from the transitions @xmath69 ( we define it as type d transition ) .",
    "again as the physical parameters change the sum of the two oscillator strengths of transitions c and d remains a constant equal to @xmath70 .",
    "note that some transition energies can have more than one optical strengths .",
    "for example , for @xmath63 at the transition energy @xmath64 three values of optical strengths @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath71 are possible . the highest peak @xmath59 with the strength @xmath71 originates from the transitions @xmath72 .",
    "the peak @xmath59 with the strength @xmath1 originates from the transitions @xmath73 .",
    "the peak @xmath59 with the strength @xmath0 originates from the transitions @xmath74 .",
    "there are thus two different initial states giving rise to the same value of the optical strength @xmath1 , and there are only one initial states giving rise to the optical strengths @xmath0 and @xmath71 .    we have verified numerically that when electrons and holes have exactly the same properties , i.e. , when _ electron - hole symmetry _",
    "is present , the dependence of the oscillator strengths for the transitions a , b , c and d on the coulomb interactions disappears completely .",
    "the oscillator strengths of these transitions become , respectively , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath75 , and @xmath77 .",
    "our main results may be attributed to the presence of degenerate states and the strongly correlated nature of multiexciton states . in the non - interacting model ,",
    "spin properties of electronic states do not change as a function of energy . in the interacting case , spin properties of electronic states do change as a function of energy . at different transition energies spin properties of",
    "optically active initial and final states are different",
    ". which initial and final states are connected by the optical selection rules will depend on the polarization of the emitted photon .",
    "several factors contribute to the quantitative aspects of the polarization dependence of the emission spectra . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2.to.n1 ] the presence of degenerate final states can enhance the oscillator strengths .",
    "the presence of degenerate initial states can lead to the presence of degenerate transitions energies .",
    "the correlated nature of some eigenstates influence the value of their oscillator strengths and can lead to a cancellation of the optical strength .",
    "our approximate calculation shows that there is a significant polarization dependence . for more realistic saqds our results",
    "may be used as a starting point of a perturbative treatment of the electron - hole exchange interaction , the coupling between s and p and between p and d levels , coupling between p - levels and the continuum states of the two - dimensional layers , heavy and light hole coupling , and elliptic dot confinement potential @xcite .",
    "we expect in these cases that the emission intensities will depend on the coulomb interactions",
    ". however , as long as the single particle level spacing is larger than the characteristic coulomb energy the effect would be minor .",
