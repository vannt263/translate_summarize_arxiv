    "the axiomatic formulation of quantum mechanics has two distinct dynamical mechanisms for evolving a state .",
    "one is unitary evolution , specified by the schrdinger equation : @xmath0 ~.\\ ] ] it is continuous , reversible and deterministic .",
    "the other is the von neumann projective measurement , which gives one of the eigenvalues of the measured observable as the measurement outcome and collapses the state to the corresponding eigenvector . with @xmath1 denoting the projection operator for the eigenstate @xmath2 , @xmath3 this change is discontinuous , irreversible and probabilistic in the choice of ",
    "@xmath4 \" .",
    "it is consistent on repetition , i.e. a second measurement of the same observable on the same system gives the same result as the first one .",
    "both these evolutions , not withstanding their dissimilar properties , take pure states to pure states .",
    "they have been experimentally verified so well that they are accepted as basic axioms in the theoretical formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "nonetheless , the formulation misses something : _ while the complete set of orthogonal projection operators @xmath5 is fixed by the measured observable , only one  @xmath4 \" occurs in a particular experimental run , and there is no prediction for which  @xmath4 \" that would be .",
    "_    what appears instead in the formulation is the probabilistic born rule , requiring an ensemble interpretation for the outcomes .",
    "measurement of an observable on a collection of identically prepared quantum states gives : @xmath6 this rule evolves pure states to mixed states .",
    "all predicted quantities are expectation values obtained as averages over many experimental runs .",
    "the mixed state also necessitates a density matrix description , instead of a ray in the hilbert space description for a pure state .      over the years",
    ", many attempts have been made to combine the two distinct quantum evolution rules in a single framework .",
    "although the problem of which  @xmath4 \" will occur in which experimental run has remained unsolved , understanding of the  ensemble evolution \" of a quantum system has been achieved in the framework of environmental decoherence .",
    "this framework assumes that the system , the measuring apparatus as well as the environment are all governed by the same set of basic quantum rules .",
    "the essential difference between the system and the environment is that the degrees of freedom of the system are observed while those of the environment are not .",
    "consequently , all the unobserved degrees of freedom need to be  summed over \" to determine how the remaining observed degrees of freedom evolve .",
    "interactions between the system and its environment , with a unitary evolution for the whole universe , entangles the observed system degrees of freedom with the unobserved environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "when the unobserved degrees of freedom are summed over , a pure but entangled state for the whole universe reduces to a mixed density matrix for the system : @xmath7 in general , the evolution of a reduced density matrix is linear , hermiticity preserving , trace preserving and positive , but not unitary . such a superoperator evolution can be expressed in the kraus decomposition form : @xmath8 using a complete basis for the environment @xmath9 . since the reduced density matrix has the same structure as the probabilistic ensemble of classical statistical mechanics , it can be described in the same language .",
    "quantum jump \" mechanism is still needed to explain how an entangled system - environment state collapses to an unentangled system eigenstate in a single experimental run .",
    "generically the environment has a much larger number of degrees of freedom than the system . then ,",
    "in the markovian approximation which assumes that information leaked from the system does not return , the evolution of the reduced density matrix can be converted to the lindblad master equation @xcite : @xmath10 + \\sum_{\\mu}{\\cal l}[l_\\mu]\\rho_s ~,\\\\ { \\cal l}[l_\\mu]\\rho_s & = & l_\\mu\\rho_s l_\\mu^\\dagger    - { 1\\over2 } \\rho_s l_\\mu^\\dagger l_\\mu - { 1\\over2 } l_\\mu^\\dagger l_\\mu\\rho_s ~. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the terms on the r.h.s . involving sum over @xmath11",
    "modify the unitary schrdinger evolution , while @xmath12 preserves the total probability .",
    "when @xmath13 , the fixed point of the evolution is a diagonal @xmath14 , in the basis that diagonalises @xmath15 .",
    "this preferred basis is determined by the system - environment interaction .",
    "( when there is no diagonal basis for @xmath15 , the evolution leads to equipartition , i.e. @xmath16 . )",
    "furthermore , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath14 decay , due to destructive interference among environmental contributions with varying phases , which is known as decoherence .",
    "this modification of a quantum system s evolution , due to its coupling to unobserved environmental degrees of freedom , provides a proper ensemble description , and a quantitative understanding of how the off - diagonal elements of @xmath14 decay @xcite .",
    "still the  measurement problem \" is not fully solved until we find the quantum jump process that can predict outcomes of individual experimental runs , and that forces us to go beyond the dynamics of eq.([schrevol ] ) .",
    "the von neumann interaction is a particular instance of the decoherence paradigm .",
    "it is continuous and deterministic , and creates perfectly entangled  schrodinger cat \" states between the measurement eigenstates of the system and the pointer states of the apparatus : @xmath17 to complete the measurement process , it needs to be supplemented by the probabilistic quantum jump that selects a particular @xmath2 and converts the diagonal elements of @xmath14 to a projection operator .",
    "in fact , the quantum jump defines which interactions of a system with its surroundings are measurement interactions : _ a measurement interaction is the one in which the apparatus can not remain in a superposition of pointer states . _",
    "the quantum jump can be realised via a continuous stochastic process , while retaining the ensemble interpretation .",
    "the familiar method is to add noise to a deterministic evolution , converting it into a langevin equation .",
    "such a realisation is strongly constrained by the properties of quantum measurement .",
    "the deterministic evolution part of the process takes the quantum state to one of the measurement eigenstates , and it has to be nonlinear to ensure repeatability of the measurement outcomes .",
    "furthermore , the noise has to vanish at the measurement eigenstates , and has to be consistent with the born rule elsewhere .    in this context ,",
    "the born rule is rather peculiar because the probabilities are determined by the initial state @xmath18 , and do not explicitly depend on the subsequent evolution of the state @xmath19 .",
    "any attempt to describe measurement as a continuous process runs into the problem that the system needs to remember its state at the instant the measurement started until the measurement is complete .",
    "one can consider pausing ( or even abandoning ) measurement part of the way along , and that must not conflict with the consistency of the results .",
    "the ability to perform independent measurements on a multipartite quantum system , together with the lack of the concept of simultaneity in special relativity , imposes another restriction on time evolution of the measurement process .",
    "a valid solution to these constraints is that the born rule is satisfied at every instant of the measurement process , when one averages over the stochastic noise .",
    "then the measurement dynamics , consisting of evolution towards an eigenstate and the associated noise , is completely local between the system and the apparatus ( does not depend on other environmental degrees of freedom ) , and the born rule is a constant of this evolution .",
    "it is indeed remarkable that such a continuous stochastic process for quantum measurement was discovered many years ago @xcite .",
    "it requires a precise combination of the evolution towards eigenstates and unbiased white noise to reproduce the born rule .",
    "( some variations of the process away from this specific form have been studied @xcite , but they fail to satisfy all the constraints @xcite . ) this restriction , together with the locality of measurement dynamics mentioned above , strongly indicates a common origin for the deterministic and the stochastic contributions to the evolution .",
    "such a relation may be an intrinsic fundamental property of quantum dynamics , but it is also quite reminiscent of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem of statistical mechanics which is a consequence of both diffusion and viscous damping arising from the same underlying molecular scattering .    understanding quantum measurement as a stochastic process is the focus of our investigation , and we analyse its ingredients in detail in section ii . with the technological progress in making quantum devices , such an analysis is not just a formal theoretical curiosity , but is also a necessity for increasing accuracy of quantum control and feedback @xcite .",
    "a practical situation is that of the weak measurement @xcite , where information about the measured observable is extracted from the system at a slow rate .",
    "such a stretching out of the time scale allows one to monitor how the system state collapses to an eigenstate of the measured observable , and to track properties of the intermediate states created along the way by an incomplete measurement .",
    "knowledge of what really happens in a particular experimental run ( and not the ensemble average ) would be invaluable in making quantum devices more efficient and stable .",
    "the stochastic measurement process does provide a continuous interpolation of projective measurement .",
    "but its nonlinear dynamics is distinct from the unitary schrdinger evolution , and one wonders whether it can arise as an effective description from a theory more fundamental than quantum mechanics .",
    "the constrained nature of the system - apparatus dynamics suggests such a possibility .",
    "over the years , a variety of theoretical approaches have been proposed to either solve or bypass the quantum measurement problem , and they need to be reconsidered in this modified setting ,    some of the approaches that go beyond quantum mechanics are physical , e.g. introduction of hidden variables with novel dynamics , and breakdown of quantum rules due to gravitational interactions .",
    "some others philosophically question what is real and what is observable , in principle as well as by human beings with limited capacity .",
    "perhaps the least intrusive of the approaches is the  many worlds interpretation \" @xcite that assigns a distinct world ( i.e. an evolutionary branch ) to each probabilistic outcome .",
    "supposing that we only observe the outcome corresponding to the world we live in does not violate any quantum principle , although the uncountable proliferation of evolutionary branches it produces is highly ungainly .",
    "none of these attempts have progressed to the level where they can be connected to verifiable experimental consequences . with the recent advances in monitoring quantum evolution during weak measurements @xcite",
    ", we have reached a stage where we can experimentally test the validity of the stochastic measurement process , and then constrain what may lie beyond .",
    "in what follows , to keep the analysis simple , we concentrate only on the evolution due to the system - apparatus interaction ; other contributions to the system evolution can be added later when needed .",
    "it is also convenient to abbreviate @xmath14 as @xmath20 .",
    "we now proceed to construct the complete quantum collapse dynamics in steps .      assuming that the projective measurement results from a continuous geodesic evolution of the initial quantum state to an eigenstate @xmath2 of the measured observable , one arrives at the collapse equation @xcite : @xmath21 ~.\\ ] ] here @xmath22 is the  measurement time \"",
    ", the coupling @xmath23 represents the strength of the system - apparatus interaction , while @xmath24 is dimensionless .",
    "this simple nonlinear evolution equation describing an individual quantum trajectory has several noteworthy properties .",
    "\\(a ) in addition to maintaining @xmath25 , the evolution preserves pure states .",
    "@xmath26 implies @xmath27 thus the component of the state along @xmath1 grows at the expense of the other orthogonal components .",
    "\\(b ) each projective measurement outcome is the fixed point of the deterministic evolution : @xmath28 the fixed point nature of the evolution makes the measurement consistent on repetition .",
    "\\(c ) in a bipartite setting , which includes the decoherence scenario , the complete set of projection operators can be labeled as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "since the evolution is linear in the projection operators , a partial trace over the unobserved degrees of freedom produces the same equation ( and hence the same fixed point ) for the reduced density matrix for the system .",
    "purification is thus a consequence of the evolution ; for example , a qubit state in the interior of the bloch sphere evolves to the fixed point on its surface .",
    "\\(d ) towards the end of measurement , as @xmath31 , convergence to the fixed point is exponential , @xmath32 , similar to the charging of a capacitor .",
    "\\(e ) for pure states , the collapse equation is just @xmath33 p_i ~,\\ ] ] in terms of the lindblad operator acting on the pointer state .",
    "this structure hints at an action - reaction relationship between the processes of decoherence and collapse , possibly following from a conservation law .",
    "its interpretation would be that during the measurement process , when @xmath34p_i$ ] decoheres the apparatus pointer state @xmath1 ( it can not remain in superposition by definition ) , there is an equal and opposite effect @xmath35p_i$ ] on the system state @xmath20 , leading to its collapse .",
    "these properties make eq.([projmeas ] ) a legitimate candidate for describing the collapse of a quantum state during measurement , modeling the single quantum trajectory specific to a particular experimental run .",
    "it represents a superoperator that preserves hermiticity , trace and positivity , but is nonlinear .",
    "we next need a separate criterion for selection of @xmath1 , to reproduce the stochastic ensemble interpretation of quantum measurement .",
    "that choice of  quantum jump \" requires a particular @xmath1 to be picked with probability @xmath36 as per the born rule . picking one of the @xmath1 at the start of the measurement and leaving it unaltered thereafter , is unsuitable for gradual weak measurements , and we look for other ways to combine the quantum trajectories for different @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the weight of the evolution trajectory for @xmath1 , with @xmath38 .",
    "we want to find real @xmath39 , as some functions of @xmath40 , that reproduce the well - established quantum behaviour .",

    "also , their asymptotic values , i.e. @xmath50 , may not vanish , whenever more than one diagonal @xmath51 remain nonzero .",
    "it is easily seen that when all the @xmath37 are equal , no information is extracted from the system by the measurement and @xmath20 does not evolve .",
