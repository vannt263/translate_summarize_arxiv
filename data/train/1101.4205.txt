    "hydrocarbon anions have recently been discovered in the quiescent molecular clouds tmc-1 @xcite and lupus-1a @xcite , the carbon - rich agb star irc+10216 @xcite , the protostars l1527 and l1521f and the pre - stellar core l1544 @xcite .",
    "the possibility that an appreciable fraction of molecular material in interstellar clouds might be in the form of anions was first suggested by @xcite and @xcite , who pointed out that carbon chain molecules and other radicals have large electron affinities , leading to large radiative attachment rates such as those measured by @xcite .",
    "however , the full significance of anions for astrochemistry is still far from understood , so we seek to address the question of just how widespread anions are in the galaxy . apart from the single detection in lupus @xcite , all interstellar anion detections to - date",
    "have been confined to the taurus molecular cloud complex .",
    "the origin of the large observed abundances of polyynes ( c@xmath6h , @xmath7 ) and cyanopolyynes ( hc@xmath8n , @xmath9 ) in this region ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is debated , and may be attributable to a young gas - phase chemistry @xcite , interactions between gas and dust ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or shocking in cloud - cloud collisions @xcite .",
    "@xcite theorised that the observed hydrocarbon anions act as catalysts for the synthesis of increased polyyne and cyanopolyyne abundances .",
    "new observations of long carbon chains and anions outside of the taurus complex will provide tests for these astrochemical models and will provide data for the development of new theories regarding the formation of carbon chains throughout the galaxy .",
    "models for anion chemistry are able to reproduce , with reasonable accuracy , the observed abundances of c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath10h@xmath1 in tmc-1 , irc+10216 and l1527 @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of cn@xmath1 in irc+10216 by @xcite also matches well the abundance predicted by the chemical model of @xcite .",
    "however , there are still discrepancies between the modelled and observed anion - to - neutral ratios , especially for c@xmath2h@xmath1 @xcite , and the lack of anions in pdrs @xcite is at variance with the model predictions of @xcite .",
    "clearly , our understanding of molecular anion chemistry is incomplete .",
    "anions may be of wider importance in astrophysics ; their presence within magnetised , collapsing cores may have consequences for star formation dynamics , through their influence on the ambipolar diffusion rate",
    ". molecular anions , including ch@xmath11cn@xmath1 , have been considered as plausible carriers for at least some of the unidentified diffuse interstellar bands @xcite .",
    "anion abundances are theorised to be sensitive to electron attachment and photodetachment rates ( see @xcite ) , and may therefore provide a useful tool for the determination of accurate electron densities and cosmic ray / photo- ionisation rates in astrophysical environments .    presently , many of the key reactions and rates relevant to molecular anion chemistry , such as those of radiative electron attachment , have not been well - studied in the laboratory , and so are poorly constrained or grossly approximated in chemical models . given the current lack of laboratory experiments and detailed ( quantum ) theoretical calculations , the only way to constrain these parameters and further our understanding of the role of anions in astrophysics is by radio observations and complementary chemical modelling of molecular anions in various astrophysical environments .",
    "this letter reports new detections of the carbon chain anion c@xmath0h@xmath1 in the vicinity of a young , low - mass protostar in the dense molecular cloud l1251a ( in the cepheus complex ) , and in the prestellar core l1512 ( in the taurus - auriga complex ) .",
    "sources were selected from a set of sixteen dense clouds for which hc@xmath3n @xmath12 maps had previously been obtained using the onsala 20-m telescope between 2005 and 2007 ( some of which were published by @xcite ) . the close chemical relationship between polyynes and cyanopolynes ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , suggests that c@xmath2h and c@xmath0h should be abundant in dense molecular clouds , close to where the hc@xmath3n peaks .",
    "therefore , to improve the chances of successfully detecting c@xmath2h , c@xmath0h and c@xmath0h@xmath1 compared with previous surveys ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we targeted the strongest hc@xmath3n emission peaks in these maps , which , due to chemical differentiation ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , are not generally coincident with the locations of peak emission from commonly observed molecules such as nh@xmath3 , n@xmath11h@xmath13 or co ( for which maps already exist in the literature ) .",
    "@xmath12 maps of l1251a and l1512 are shown in figure [ fig : map ] .",

    "our observed position is @xmath14 se of the embedded class 0 protostar l1251a irs3 , which powers a molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "the protostar centre is located outside of the @xmath15 gbt beam ( see figure [ fig : map ] ) , so emission from its core does not directly influence our observations . however , depending on the radius of its outer boundary ( which is likely to be up to a few times @xmath71  au ; see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , gas from inside the protostar envelope is probably responsible for much of the observed molecular emission .",
    "it would be of interest to observe the carbon chain ( and anion ) emission closer to the protostellar core , to determine whether the elevated temperatures there have any impact on the abundances of these species , as has been hypothesised by @xcite .",
    "although previous observations have shown relatively large hc@xmath3n and hc@xmath4n abundances in various parts of the cepheus complex , our observations constitute the largest reported c@xmath2h column density and the first detection of the long - chain species c@xmath0h and hc@xmath5n in this region . the derived [ hc@xmath5n]/[hc@xmath4n ] ratio of 63% is exceptionally high compared with other dense interstellar clouds ; the largest value observed in the seven carbon - chain - rich clouds reported by @xcite and @xcite is 37% in tmc-1 .",
    "however , there is some uncertainty in the excitation temperatures of these species , as they have been found to differ from each other in tmc-1 by about 1 - 3  k ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) . assuming the hc@xmath4n rotational temperature is 4 - 5  k and the hc@xmath5n temperature 5 - 7  k , and accounting for the optical depth of the hc@xmath4n line ( 0.3 )",

    "the profiles of the spectral lines in l1251a show a small amount of asymmetry  insufficient to justify fitting multiple gaussians , but nevertheless indicative of a more complex cloud structure .",
    "although we derive a lower temperature for this cloud than l1512 , the lines are broader by approximately a factor of two , which indicates the presence of significant bulk motions of the gases along the line of sight .",
    "this may be related to turbulence arising from the l1251a irs3 outflow , which partially intersects our observed telescope beam .",
    "there is some evidence that the c@xmath0h@xmath1 lines ( with @xmath72  ) are narrower in this source than the lines of the neutral species ( with @xmath73  ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon was also observed by @xcite in lupus-1a , who suggested that this may be due to the anion being preferentially located in cooler , denser gas than the neutral .",
    "this suggestion seems reasonable on the basis that the rate of radiative electron attachment , and thus , the rate of anion formation is theorised to be proportional to @xmath74 and to the electron density @xcite .",
    "l1512 is a rather isolated molecular cloud core located in the nearby taurus - auriga complex @xcite .",

    "@xcite previously attempted to detect c@xmath0h@xmath1 at the @xcite position ( @xmath76 east of our observed position , as shown in figure [ fig : map ] ) , and they derived an upper limit of 4.8@xmath61  @xmath60 , which is consistent with our observed column density ( see table [ tab : colds ] )",
    ". they also derived c@xmath2h and c@xmath0h column densities of 9@xmath77  @xmath60 and 5@xmath78  @xmath60 , respectively , which closely match our observed values .",
    "@xcite measured an hc@xmath3n column density of 2.5@xmath79  @xmath60 , @xmath80 west of our l1512 position , which is in reasonably good agreement with our observed value .",
    "the similarities of our observed column densities with those found nearby indicate that polyyne and cyanopolyyne abundances may be less variable than shown by the hc@xmath3n map in figure [ fig : map ] , over spatial scales of @xmath81 ( which corresponds to 0.02  pc at the distance of l1512 ) .",
    "this implies that the strong , compact peak shown in the hc@xmath3n map may arise at least partly as a result of enhanced gas densities and/or temperatures in that region , which ( in the case of sub - critical line excitation ) , would cause increased hc@xmath3n @xmath12 emission as a result of increased excitation of the relatively high energy ( 24  k ) @xmath82 rotational level .",
    "located in two distinctly separate parts of the sky ( l1251a is @xmath83  pc distant in cepheus , whereas l1512 is @xmath84  pc distant in auriga ) , it is surprising how chemically similar these two clouds are . apart from hc@xmath5n ,",
    "all of the observed column densities are within a factor of two of each other ( see table [ tab : colds ] ) .",
    "this also applies to nh@xmath3 @xcite and n@xmath11h@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the large anion , polyyne and cyanopolyyne abundances are indicative of an active carbon chemistry , comparable to that observed in other carbon - chain - rich regions of the galaxy ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "large abundances of unsaturated carbon chains are theorised to occur either in the relatively early stages of dark cloud evolution when carbon is abundant in reactive form ( see for example , @xcite ) , or later on during the ` freeze - out peak ' @xcite . in the latter scenario , the lighter , more reactive elements such as atomic oxygen are theorised to freeze out onto the dust grains over time .",
    "the loss of oxygen from the gas - phase results in reduced destruction rates for the carbon - chain - bearing species and their associated reagents , giving rise to elevated abundances of these species later on in a dense cloud s evolution .    over time ,",
    "two of the primary destructive reactants for organic anions  atomic hydrogen and oxygen  are lost from the gas phase through conversion on dust grain surfaces to h@xmath11 and h@xmath11o , respectively @xcite .",
    "this may explain why the c@xmath0h@xmath1 anion - to - neutral ratios are greater in denser clouds ( including l1521a , l1512 and l1527 ) , than in the quiescent , lower - density clouds tmc-1 and lupus-1a .",
    "oxygen and hydrogen react quickly with c@xmath0h@xmath1 @xcite , so the combined effects of the depletion of o and h in these relatively more dense environments may be responsible for the large observed anion - to - neutral ratios in protostars and pre - stellar cores .    alternatively , elevated carbon chain abundances could arise as a consequence of selective methane sublimation from dust grain surfaces , as originally investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is hypothesised that as a protostellar object contracts and begins to heat the surrounding gas , sublimated methane reacts with c@xmath13 to form hydrocarbon ions , which gives rise to a so - called warm carbon chain chemistry ( wccc ) via subsequent ion - molecule reactions ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "given the close proximity of our observed l1251a position to the protostar irs3 , the wccc theory may be applicable as a possible explanation for the large hydrocarbon abundances present there .",
    "the location of our l1512 anion detection coincides with the region of co depletion identified by @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for the anion and carbon chain detections in l1521f and l1544 made by @xcite .",
    "thus , the ` freeze - out peak ' chemistry may be the preferred explanation for the large anion and carbon chain abundances observed in l1512 and similar pre - stellar cores .",
    "the presence of hydrocarbon anions is likely to be partly responsible for the large ( neutral ) polyyne and cyanopolyyne abundances in l1251a and l1512 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we have detected the carbon chain anion c@xmath0h@xmath1 for the first time in l1251a and l1512 .",
    "large column densities of the neutral species c@xmath2h , c@xmath0h , hc@xmath4n , hc@xmath5n and c@xmath3s were also detected .",
    "combined with the five previous interstellar anion detections by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , these results show that anions tend to be present in detectable quantities in regions where carbon chains are highly abundant , especially surrounding embedded protostars and pre - stellar cores .",
    "the anion - to - neutral ratio [ c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c@xmath0h ] is consistently on the order of a few percent and shows an apparent positive correlation with density .",
    "this implies that a relatively uniform and simple physical / chemical mechanism is responsible for regulating molecular anion abundances in the different interstellar clouds observed so far .",
    "the large polyyne and cyanopolyyne abundances measured in l1251a show that carbon chain production processes are rapid in this part of the cepheus flare molecular cloud complex , resulting in similar abundances to those found in the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "the observation of abundant c@xmath0h@xmath1 in l1251a constitutes the first detection of anions in a protostellar envelope outside of the taurus - auriga complex , and indicates that anions are likely to be widespread throughout galactic star - forming regions where carbon chains are present .",
    "the technique of using hc@xmath3n and c@xmath2h as proxies for the detection of less abundant , larger carbon chains and anions shows strong promise as a means for obtaining further detections of these molecules in low - mass star - forming regions in the future .",

    "<S> we report the detection of microwave emission lines from the hydrocarbon anion c@xmath0h@xmath1 and its parent neutral c@xmath0h in the star - forming region l1251a ( in cepheus ) , and the pre - stellar core l1512 ( in auriga ) . </S>",
    "<S> the carbon - chain - bearing species c@xmath2h , hc@xmath3n , hc@xmath4n , hc@xmath5n and c@xmath3s are also detected in large abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the observations of l1251a constitute the first detections of anions and long - chain polyynes and cyanopolyynes ( with more than 5 carbon atoms ) in the cepheus flare star - forming region , and the first detection of anions in the vicinity of a protostar outside of the taurus molecular cloud complex , highlighting a wider importance for anions in the chemistry of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> rotational excitation temperatures have been derived from the hc@xmath3n hyperfine structure lines , and are found to be 6.2  k for l1251a and 8.7  k for l1512 . </S>",
    "<S> the anion - to - neutral ratios are 3.6% and 4.1% , respectively , which are within the range of values previously observed in the interstellar medium , and suggest a relative uniformity in the processes governing anion abundances in different dense interstellar clouds . </S>",
    "<S> this research contributes towards the growing body of evidence that carbon chain anions are relatively abundant in interstellar clouds throughout the galaxy , but especially in the regions of relatively high density and high depletion surrounding pre - stellar cores and young , embedded protostars . </S>"
