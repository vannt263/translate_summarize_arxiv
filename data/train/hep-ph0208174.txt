    "the @xmath8- and @xmath4-meson photoproduction , @xmath9 , in the near threshold region , @xmath10 2.5 gev , can be described through quite simple mechanisms : the @xmath6-exchange for @xmath4 photoproduction and the scalar @xmath7-exchange for @xmath8 photoproduction .",
    "the two coupling constants , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which enter in the calculation of the absolute values of the differential cross section for @xmath13 , are well known .",
    "the existing experimental data on the @xmath14dependence of the differential cross sections in the near threshold region can be reproduced with the help of few parameters such as the cut - off parameters of phenomenological form factors @xcite .    in the case of @xmath15-photoproduction , @xmath13",
    ", the contribution of @xmath6-exchange is too small , and the suggested mechanism of @xmath7-exchange depends on the product of two unknown coupling constants @xmath16 , which can be fitted in order to obtain an agreement of such model with the experimental cross section @xmath17 . as a result , using the constant @xmath18 , from @xmath19-potential @xcite , it was possible to find the numerical value for the unknown coupling constant @xmath20 ( for the standard choice of the corresponding lagrangian ) .",
    "the determination of this coupling constant in the framework of qcd sum rules , gives also relatively large values : @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath23 decay in the framework of two possible mechanisms the @xmath7-exchange , @xmath24 and brehmstrahlung radiation by charged pions produced led to even larger values of @xmath25 @xcite . in the last case ,",
    "it was not possible to find an unique value for this constant , because the final result depends on the mass and the width of the @xmath7-meson , which value is given in a broad range , 0.4 gev@xmath261.4 gev , 0.6 gev@xmath271 gev @xcite .",
    "note , in this connection , that a large value of the @xmath25 coupling constant has been considered also for the explanation @xcite of the hermes effect @xcite , concerning the anomalous nuclear dependence of the cross section for the inclusive electroproduction on nuclei at relatively small momentum transfer squared , @xmath28 : the increasing absorption of virtual photons with longitudinal polarization and the decreasing cross section with transversally polarized photons .",
    "for completeness we should note that the @xmath29 coupling constant ( with the corresponding electromagnetic form factor for the space - like momentum transfer ) is important for the discussion of very actual problems , concerning the meson exchange currents in the physics of the electromagnetic deuteron structure @xcite .",
    "finally let us mention that the @xmath30-coupling constant can be estimated on the basis of the existing experimental data on the radiative decays of @xmath15- and @xmath4-mesons : @xmath31 the very small branching ratios of these decays ( @xmath32 , @xcite ) are in contradiction with large values of the @xmath33-coupling constant , which have been derived before , using theoretical considerations ( qcd - sum rules ) @xcite , and experimental data on @xmath13 and the hermes effect @xcite . in the last two cases , the @xmath33-coupling constants have been determined by fitting the data , in the framework of a model . in the case of the process @xmath13 , only the @xmath7-contribution has been taken into account @xcite .",
    "but in the near threshold region , other mechanisms contribute : the nucleon exchanges in the s- and t - channel , the excitation of various nucleonic resonances and even extrapolation of pomeron exchange to the threshold region .",
    "the same is correct for the model of the hermes effect .",
    "only the decays ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) can be considered as direct methods to determine the @xmath33-coupling constants .    in this paper",
    "we plan to discuss another possible method to determine the @xmath33-coupling constant -through the measurement of t - even asymmetries in the collision of circularly polarized photons with a polarized proton target .",
    "the circular polarization of the photon results from the brehmstrahlung of longitudinally polarized electrons .",
    "such beams are available at mami ( mainz ) @xcite and at the jefferson laboratory , where it has recently been used in the study of the deuteron photodisintegration @xmath34-with the measurement of the polarization of the outgoing proton @xcite . in principle",
    "such experiments , as @xmath35 or @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath4 , are actually feasible .",
    "the dependence of the differential cross section of the process @xmath35 on the polarizations of the colliding particles can be written in the following form @xcite :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the differential cross section with unpolarized particles , @xmath40 is the photon helicity ( we suppose , for simplicity that the photon beam is fully circularly polarized ) , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the possible components of the target proton polarization @xmath43 . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the t - even asymmetries for the process @xmath35 , which are real functions of the photon energy @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the v - meson production angle in the reaction cms .",
    "the coordinate system is defined as follows : the @xmath49axis is along the photon three - momentum @xmath50 and the @xmath51-plane coincides with the reaction plane , so that the @xmath52axis is along the normal to the scattering plane .",
    "the parametrization ( [ eq : sig ] ) is very general and holds for any binary process in @xmath53-collisions , due to the p - invariance of the electromagnetic interaction of hadrons .",
    "let us calculate these asymmetries , in framework of the @xmath54-exchange model , for @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the lagrangians for @xmath56- and @xmath57- interactions are : @xmath58 where @xmath11 is the coupling constant for the pseudoscalar @xmath56-interaction and @xmath18 is the coupling constant of the @xmath57-vertex , which is uniquely defined .",
    "the corresponding electromagnetic interactions with vector mesons are described by the following lagrangians : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the electric charge , so that @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the vector meson mass , @xmath64 is the photon field strength tensor and @xmath65 is the vector meson field . in the momentum space",
    "the lagrangians ( [ lag ] ) induce the following spin structure for @xmath66- and @xmath67- vertices : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) are the four vector of polarization and the four momentum of the photon ( v - meson ) , so @xmath73    the matrix element , corresponding to @xmath5-exchange , in the process @xmath74 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , can be written as follows : @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 ( the notation of the particle four - momenta is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are phenomenological form factors , which insure the correct @xmath14dependence of the differential cross section @xmath80 in the framework of the considered model .",
    "the matrix element ( [ eq : mat ] ) satisfies the condition of gauge invariance of the electromagnetic interaction - for any value of the coupling constants , form factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 and in any kinematical condition .",
    "the sum @xmath81 generates very particular polarization phenomena .",
    "first of all , due to the fact that the amplitudes are real ( in contradiction with the unitarity condition ) all t - odd polarization phenomena , such as , for example , the analyzing powers ( induced by the target polarization ) or the components of the polarization of the final protons ( in collisions of unpolarized particles ) are identically zero .",
    "the simplest t - even polarization observable , the @xmath82-asymmetry , induced by linear polarized photons also vanishes , due to the specific spin structure of both electromagnetic vertices , @xmath83 and @xmath67 , which enter in the considered model with @xmath5-exchange .    the density matrix of the @xmath84-meson is @xmath85 - with @xmath86-dependence of the decay products in @xmath87 .",
    "these predictions hold for any kinematical condition , for the considered reactions in the framework of @xmath5-exchange , independently on the value of the coupling constants and the parametrization of the form factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "such predictions on polarization observables , if experimentally verified , constitute a powerful test of the validity of the model , for @xmath13 .",
    "the t - even polarization observables @xmath44 , @xmath45 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig ] ) , which are not vanishing , bring information on the details of the model .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath45 is related to the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule @xcite , which applies to the process of vector meson photoproduction on nucleons , @xmath88 . typically , due to the relatively large threshold , its contribution is not so large @xcite . but this asymmetry is considered here from another point of view .    the angular dependence of the asymmetry @xmath44 follows a @xmath89-distribution , as a result of the helicity conservation for the collinear regime .    using the matrix elements , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat ] ) , one can find the following formulas for the asymmetries @xmath44 and @xmath45 in terms of the corresponding coupling constants ( assuming , for simplicity , @xmath90 ) :    @xmath91    @xmath92 , \\label{eq : eq7}\\ ] ]    @xmath93    @xmath94    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the nucleon mass and @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 is the photon energy in the c.m.s . and @xmath100 .",
    "at a fixed value of the ratio @xmath101 , the asymmetries @xmath44 and @xmath45 , are functions of @xmath99 and of the momentum transfer squared , @xmath1 , which varies in the interval : @xmath102 . figs . [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] illustrate the sensitivity of these asymmetries for the processes @xmath103 to the ratio @xmath101 of the coupling constants @xmath104 and @xmath105 as functions of @xmath1 , for different photon energies ( in the near threshold region ) .",
    "one can see that the asymmetry @xmath45 is characterized by a weak energy dependence , and by a relatively weak @xmath1-dependence , in the considered @xmath46-interval , for a wide interval of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "being positive in the considered kinematical region , this asymmetry shows an essential sensitivity to the ratio @xmath106 for any value of @xmath1 and for the two values of @xmath46 , @xmath108 and 1.8 gev .    the asymmetry @xmath44 is large ( in absolute value ) for small values of @xmath1 , where the differential cross section is larger - with a strong energy and @xmath14dependence",
    "this asymmetry is also sensitive to the ratio @xmath106 and to @xmath107 .",
    "note that , in the framework of the considered model , @xmath6+@xmath7-exchange , the relative values of the asymmetries @xmath109 can be predicted exactly , without any dependence on @xmath107 and on the different coupling constants , being therefore a good test of the validity of the model .",
    "note that , in a similar way , it is possible to consider also similar polarization phenomena for the inelastic vector meson processes @xcite : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a nucleon resonance with spin @xmath112 and parity @xmath113 equal to @xmath114 ( the roper resonance ) or @xmath115 ( the n(1535 ) ) . applying the same model of @xmath5-exchanges , one can see that the @xmath7 and @xmath6 contributions to the matrix element of the process ( [ eq : eq11 ] ) do not interfere in the differential cross section with unpolarized particles .",
    "therefore the @xmath82-asymmetry vanishes , but with the same the sensitivity to the relative role of @xmath116 and @xmath7-exchanges for the double polarization observables @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , instead of the parameter @xmath101 , one has to define another ratio , @xmath117 , @xmath118 therefore , the measurement of the two ratios , @xmath101 and @xmath117 allows to determine the @xmath119 coupling constant : @xmath120 this ratio is independent on the radiative coupling constants , therefore the ratio @xmath121 is of the same order for @xmath4 and @xmath8-photoproduction , if the @xmath54-model applies .",
    "note that the circular polarization of the photon beam results also in non - zero @xmath122- and @xmath123-components of the final proton polarization .",
    "generally the observables @xmath122 and @xmath123 contain new dynamical information in comparison with the asymmetries @xmath44 and @xmath45 , but it is not the case in the considered model , where they are determined by the same formulas .",
    "we derived the cross section and the polarization observables for the photoproduction of vector mesons on polarized protons , with a circularly polarized beam , @xmath124 , @xmath125 or @xmath126 .",
    "we applied the @xmath54-model in the near threshold region and gave predictions for the polarization observables .",
    "the two possible asymmetries @xmath44 and @xmath45 have been determined through the @xmath127-interference , with a resulting sensitivity to the sign and the absolute value of the ratio @xmath101 of the strong and the electromagnetic coupling constants ( eq . [ eq : eq11 ] ) . taking into account that the @xmath105 and the @xmath11 coupling constants are well known from other sources , the measurements of the ratios @xmath128 and @xmath129 will open the possibility to determine the @xmath104- couplings . taking the @xmath130 prediction for the ratio @xmath131 , which is in good agreement with the existing data on the widths of the radiative decays @xmath132",
    ", one can find : @xmath133 it is important to note that the ratio @xmath134 does not depend on the @xmath18 coupling constant .",
    "the comparison of the obtained values of @xmath135 with this ratio from the decay @xmath136 , will constitute a good test of the existing theoretical approaches .",
    "note that the asymmetries @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for the vector meson photoproduction on neutrons @xmath137 have the same absolute values , but differ in sign from the corresponding asymmetries on polarized proton target .",
    "this is another possible test of the validity of the @xmath54-model as any additional contribution to the matrix element of the considered process violates this relation .",
