    "hamiltonian control theory has been developed in @xcite aiming to improve some selected features of a given hamiltonian system ( like to reduce its chaotic behavior ) , by adding a ` small control term ' which slightly alters the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "this technique was adapted in @xcite to the case of symplectic maps .",
    "in particular , it was applied to a four - dimensional ( 4d ) map which models a simplified accelerator ring with sextupole nonlinearity , succeeding to increase the stability domain around the nominal circular orbit ( the so - called dynamic aperture - da ) .",
    "this procedure allowed the construction of a sequence of control terms of increasing complexity , that successively improve the dynamics of the original map .",
    "actually , the larger the da became the functional complexity of the control term increased , and the required cpu time for the evolution of orbits grew .",
    "real accelerators are composed of such simplified maps ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we believe that the study of these maps can guide the research for increasing the da of more complicated models .    the aim of the present paper is to show that also simplified versions of the general control term can lead to a significant increase of the da . for accelerators",
    "the addition of a control term can be interpreted as the addition of an extra magnet . since",
    "magnetic fields depend only on spatial variables we investigate the efficiency of a modified control term obtained by neglecting the dependence on the momenta of the general control term constructed in @xcite .    in many real accelerators the vertical extend of the beam is much smaller than its horizontal size .",
    "such cases can be approximated by considering ideal , flat beams of zero height , whose dynamics is described by a restriction of the general 4d accelerator model to a 2-dimensional subspace .",
    "we also apply our control theory to a 2d map model of this type , improving the stability of the flat beam .",
    "as in @xcite we consider a simplified accelerator ring with linear frequencies ( tunes ) @xmath0 , @xmath1 , having a localized thin sextupole magnet .",
    "the evolution of a charged particle is modeled by the 4d symplectic map @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) denotes the initial deflection from the ideal circular orbit in the horizontal ( vertical ) direction before the particle enters the element , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the associated momentum .",
    "primes denote positions and momenta after one turn in the ring .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are related to the accelerator s tunes @xmath0 and @xmath1 by @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in our study , we set @xmath11 and @xmath12 corresponding to a regular orbit as shown in @xcite and @xmath1 have been considered as parameters .",
    "so , our results can be straightforwardly applied to other cases , remaining valid for tunes satisfying a non - resonant condition ( see section [ sec : methods ] below ) .",
    "we also note that our method can be easily adapted to the resonant case , but the construction of a new control term is required . ] .",
    "the particle dynamics at the @xmath13-th turn , can be described by the sequence @xmath14 , where the @xmath15-th positions and momenta are defined as a function of the @xmath13-th ones by  .",
    "for sake of completeness , let us briefly recall the theoretical framework developed in @xcite ) . map naturally decomposes in a integrable part , the rotation by angles @xmath7 , @xmath8 in the planes @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , and a quadratic perturbation , and can be obtained as the time-@xmath18 flow of the following hamiltonian systems @xmath19 using the notation of the poisson bracket  which is defined by @xmath20 for any function @xmath21  map can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the transpose of a matrix , and the exponential map is defined as @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .    assuming that the perturbation @xmath27 is small close to the origin , so that @xmath28 , we can construct a _",
    "control map _ whose generator @xmath29 is small with respect to @xmath27 ( i.e.  it satisfies @xmath30 ) .",
    "moreover , the _ controlled map _",
    "@xmath31 is symplectic and conjugated to a map @xmath32 , closer to @xmath33 than @xmath34 ( for more details the reader is referred to @xcite ) .",
    "assuming furthermore , that a non - resonant condition is satisfied for the particular choice of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 values of map , the generator @xmath29 of the control map @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a `` pseudo - inverse '' operator , which satisfies @xmath38 ( see @xcite for more details ) .    even truncating the generator @xmath29 at order 2 and using @xmath39 as an _ approximate generator _ , the control map @xmath40 can not , in general , be written in a closed analytic form .",
    "so , we define a _ truncated control map of order _",
    "@xmath41 @xmath42 and a _ truncated controlled map of order _ @xmath41 : @xmath43    following @xcite , the smaller alignment index ( sali ) method of chaos detection is used to determine the regular or chaotic nature of orbits of map and its controlled version .",
    "we note that an orbit is considered to escape and collide with the accelerator s vacuum chamber if at some time @xmath13 @xmath44 . for the evaluation of sali ,",
    "the tangent of the studied map is computed and employed for following the evolution of two initially linearly independent unit deviation vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 , defining the index as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the usual euclidean norm and @xmath49 , @xmath50 are vectors of unit norm .    the behavior of sali , and its generalization",
    ", the so - called generalized alignment index ( gali ) , has been studied in detail in @xcite . according to these studies , in 4d maps the sali of chaotic orbits tends exponentially to zero as @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 , @xmath53 being the two largest lyapunov characteristic exponents of the orbit ) , while it fluctuates around positive values , i.e.  @xmath54 , for regular orbits . in the case of 2d maps",
    ", the sali tends to zero both for regular and chaotic orbits , as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "thus , the completely different behaviors of sali for regular and chaotic orbits allow us to clearly distinguish between the two case both for 4d and 2d maps .    in the following we consider an orbit to be chaotic if @xmath57 after @xmath13 iterations .",
    "we note that in our studies we typically have @xmath58 for regular orbits .",
    "consequently the chosen threshold value ( @xmath57 ) safely guaranties the chaotic nature of orbits .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the 4@xmath59 order controlled map @xmath60 , is a very good choice for the controlled system , since it succeeded to considerably increase the da of the accelerator , keeping also the required cpu time for the evolution of large sets of initial conditions , at acceptable levels .",
    "the computed generator @xmath61 is a complicated function of both the positions @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the momenta @xmath5 , @xmath6 of map ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) , and its specific expression is given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "a simple approach for investigating the global dynamics of 4d accelerator maps , used in @xcite , was the computation of the maximal radius of a 4-dimensional hypersphere centered at @xmath62 , containing only regular orbits up to a finite but large number of iterations .",
    "this approach provides a reliable indication of the size of the da .",
    "application of this methodology in @xcite showed that the controlled map @xmath60 has better stability properties than the uncontrolled map ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that the center of these hyperspheres does not bear any particular physical meaning , as it does not correspond to an experimentally realizable beam configuration .    from a physical point of view",
    "it is more meaningful to study the dynamics of the nominal orbit having @xmath63 for different momenta @xmath5 , @xmath6 . for this purpose",
    ", we consider 4-dimensional hyperspheres , centered at @xmath64 and compute for different values of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , the radius @xmath65 of the largest hypersphere which contains only regular orbits .",
    "the outcome of this investigation is presented in fig .  [ mom ] , where the @xmath5 , @xmath6 coordinates of the centers of the considered hyperspheres are colored according to the value of radius @xmath65 for the uncontrolled map ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) ( fig .",
    "[ mom](a ) ) , and the @xmath60 map ( fig .  [ mom](b ) ) . for both maps",
    "the largest value of @xmath65 is obtained for @xmath66 ( i.e.  the value obtained in @xcite ) , while @xmath65 decreases as the hypershere s center is moved away from @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that large values of the momenta introduce instabilities and chaotic behavior , which reduce the size of the stability domain .    nevertheless , the controlled map @xmath60 succeeded to increase the stability region , since @xmath67 for larger value of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with respect to the original map .",
    "in addition , @xmath65 attains larger values in the central region of the @xmath68 plane for the controlled map @xmath60 , being @xmath69 , which suggests a significant increase of the stability domain around the nominal orbit of the accelerator .",
    "as it has already being mentioned , the controlled map @xmath60 has a complicated functional form , depending both on spatial variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 and on the conjugate momenta @xmath5 , @xmath6 . from a practical point of view , the addition of a control map ( [ eq : ctrlmapordk ] ) can be thought as the addition of an appropriate magnetic element in the ring . on the other hand ,",
    "the vector potential of a maxwellian magnetic field which is transverse to the particle motion ( i.e. without any longitudinal dependence ) is a function of these transverse positions and not momenta .",
    "it is legitimate then to investigate the efficiency of a modified control term , obtained by neglecting the dependence of @xmath61 on momenta . in practice",
    ", this means that we set @xmath66 in the expression of @xmath61 obtained in @xcite , getting @xmath70 + \\nonumber \\right . \\\\ & & \\left .",

    "since @xmath74 does not depend on the momenta , the control map @xmath75 , can be explicitly computed .",
    "the action of this map on @xmath5 is given by @xmath76 because @xmath77 does not depend on the momenta and consequently @xmath78 for all integers @xmath79 .",
    "similar relations hold also for the other variables , i.e.  @xmath80 for all integers @xmath79 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus , no truncation of the form ( [ eq : ctrlmapordk ] ) is needed , and consequently the simplified controlled map @xmath82 is symplectic by construction , as a composition of three explicitly known symplectic maps .    since map @xmath83 is not explicitly constructed by the hamiltonian control theory ,",
    "it is interesting to check its performance in controlling map ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) and increasing its da . following @xcite , the sali method is used to determine the regular or chaotic nature of orbits of map @xmath83 . in order to directly compare these results with the ones obtained in previous studies , the values of @xmath84 after @xmath85 iterations",
    "are plotted in fig .",

    "[ pp](b ) ) , and the simplified map @xmath83 ( [ eq : momenta0 ] ) ( fig .  [ pp](c ) ) .",
    "chaotic orbits are characterized by small sali values and are located in the blue colored domains , regular orbits are colored red , while white regions correspond to orbits that escape in less than @xmath85 iterations .",
    "[ pp ] shows that both controlled maps , @xmath60 and @xmath83 , increase the da of the accelerator .",
    "it is remarkable that the simplified controlled map @xmath83 not only increases the region of non - escaping orbits , with respect to the original system , but also decreases drastically the number of chaotic orbits .    in order to perform a more global investigation of the dynamics of these maps we consider ,",
    "as was done in @xcite , initial conditions inside a 4-dimensional hypersphere centered at @xmath87 , and compute the percentages of regular and chaotic orbits as a function of the hypersphere radius @xmath88 ( fig .",
    "[ da ] ) . from the red curves in fig .",
    "[ da ] , it is observed that the @xmath83 map significantly increases the domain of regular motion , not only with respect to the original map ( black curves in fig .  [ da ] ) , but also with respect to the controlled map @xmath60 ( blue curves in fig .  [ da ] ) .",
    "in addition , map @xmath83 has the smallest percentage of chaotic orbits among the studied models , which means that orbits of this map either escape or they are regular .    thus , map",
    "@xmath83 ( [ eq : momenta0 ] ) controls the original system ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) more efficiently than map @xmath60 ( [ eq : ctrlledmapordk ] ) .",
    "additional advantages of this map is its simplicity , since it depends only on the spatial variables , and the fact that it is symplectic by construction .",
    "another feature , which could be of major practical importance , is that the generator @xmath74 ( [ eq : gen ] ) of the simplified control map @xmath83 can be considered as the potential induced by a magnetic element , since it depends only on spatial variables .",
    "these results show that the simplified controlled map @xmath89 works better than the controlled map @xmath60 which is also able to enlarge the da with respect to @xmath90 .",
    "then , a natural task would be to compare @xmath89 with @xmath91 or with @xmath92 .",
    "we note that we were not able to find a closed analytic form for the latter maps due to the cumbersome involved summations .",
    "thus , these comparisons remain open problems which we plan to address in the future",
    ". however , we remark that the finite number of terms involved in @xmath60 possibly allows the attribution of a real magnetic element to this map , while probably this will not be feasible for maps @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "in many particle accelerators the beam is very flat , i.e. its vertical extend is much smaller than the horizontal one .",
    "a simple , first , approach in investigating the dynamics of a flat beam of the 4d map ( [ eq:4dfodo ] ) is to neglect the vertical coordinate @xmath4 and its corresponding momentum @xmath6 , and pass from the initial 4d map to the 2d map @xmath93 whose dynamics was studied for example in @xcite .    following for this map , the procedure described in sect .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , truncated control @xmath94 and controlled @xmath95 maps of order @xmath41 are constructed , in analogy to eqs .   and , respectively .",
    "as before , the controlled map is not necessarily symplectic . since a map is symplectic if its jacobian matrix @xmath96 satisfies ( in its definition domain ) the equality @xmath97 ( with @xmath98 being the standard symplectic constant matrix ) , the symplectic nature of @xmath95 can be checked by computing the norm @xmath99 of @xmath100 , for the jacobian matrix @xmath101 of the map .",
    "the results of this computation are presented in fig .",
    "[ symp ] , for orders @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , in the region @xmath105\\times[-1,1]$ ] , and show that @xmath106 is a good approximation of a symplectic map for @xmath107 , since @xmath108 for a large portion ( @xmath109 % ) of variable values .",
    "as expected , the larger the order @xmath41 , the closer the map @xmath95 numerically approaches the symplectic condition .    in order to check whether the controlled map @xmath95 with",
    "@xmath110 increases the da of the flat beam , we use again the sali to determine the nature of orbits in the @xmath111 plane , keeping in mind that sali tends to zero both for regular and chaotic orbits of 2d maps , but with time rates which allow the clear distinction between the two cases .",
    "in particular , many initial conditions are tracked for @xmath112 iterations in the @xmath111 plane , and colored according to their final @xmath84 value , for the @xmath113 ( fig .",
    "[ 2dplein](a ) ) , the @xmath114 ( fig .  [ 2dplein](b ) ) , and the @xmath115 map .",
    "orbits with @xmath116 are characterized as chaotic and are colored in blue , while the remaining ones are regular . similarly to fig .",
    "[ pp ] white regions correspond to escaping orbits .",
    "this distinction is based on the theoretical prediction that for regular orbits @xmath117 at @xmath118 . in figs .  [ 2dplein](d)(f ) the percentages of regular ( blue curves ) , chaotic ( red curves ) , and escaping ( green curves ) orbits of these three maps are plotted as a function of the radius @xmath88 of a circle centered at the origin @xmath119 .    in all models",
    "the number of chaotic orbits is practically negligible , which means that orbits are either regular or escaping .",
    "the two controlled maps succeed to increase the da of the beam , because the domain of non - escaping orbits increases ( figs .  [ 2dplein](a)(c ) ) .",
    "although this domain does not have a cyclical shape , the radius of the largest cycle containing only regular orbits increases from @xmath120 for the uncontrolled map @xmath113 , to @xmath121 for both controlled maps @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "since both controlled maps give essentially the same results , we conclude that the @xmath122 order truncation of the controlled map is sufficient for controlling the flat beam .",
    "in this paper , the results of the application of control theory to a simple 4d accelerator map  @xcite , are being extended by using simplified versions of the control maps . in the first case ,",
    "the momentum dependence of the control term is artificially removed , so as the control map is a function of the spacial coordinates and thus resembles the magnetic vector potential of a multi - pole magnet .",
    "in addition , this control map is symplectic by construction in contrast to the original one , thus avoiding the associated problems of having to choose an appropriate order of truncation in the lie representation , for which the map satisfies numerically the symplectic condition .",
    "the efficiency of the simplified control map is remarkable , not only achieving the increase of the da , but also shows a better performance as compared to the complete control map . the remaining important issue regarding the possibility to approximate in practice this magnetic field by a multi - pole magnet is still open , and will be addressed in a future study . in this respect , and based on the knowledge that control theory can be efficiently used to increase the da of a toy model , the studies can be extended by investigating the possibility of imposing a control map with the functional form similar to eq .  , and compute the associated multi - pole coefficients which achieve the best increase in the da .    in the second case ,",
    "the same theory is applied to a 2d version of the map , modeling flat beams , as it is the case in electron and positron low emittance rings ( i.e. with small beam sizes ) , where the vertical beam size is several orders of magnitude smaller than the horizontal one and thus the dynamics studies can be restricted to that plane .",
    "this 2d control map presents the same characteristics as the original map , i.e. increase of the da , for a truncation order equal to 6 .    in all our studies ,",
    "the sali indicator was mainly used for showing the improvement of control in the da . in future work",
    ", we plan to apply the frequency map analysis method ( e.g. see  @xcite and references therein ) in this map in order to understand the dynamical details of this improvement with respect to resonance excitation and diffusion .",
