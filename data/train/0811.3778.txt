    "the higgs mechanism  @xcite is central to the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) .",
    "the existence of the higgs field maintains the theory weakly interacting up to high energy scales and prevents some processes from violating unitarity . in the process of spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry ,",
    "the weak bosons @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as well as leptons and quarks , acquire mass through interactions with the higgs field . in the sm ,",
    "the simplest form of the higgs mechanism is assumed , which predicts the existence of a single scalar particle , the higgs boson and a single free parameter , its mass ( @xmath2 . the discovery of this particle would provide experimental evidence for the higgs mechanism .",
    "the discovery and study of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is one of the main goals of the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments , operating at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "many models of physics beyond the sm predict a more complex higgs sector , covered elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "direct searches for the higgs boson produced in association with a @xmath1 were performed in the large electron positron collider ( lep ) .",
    "these resulted in the exclusion of the higgs boson in the mass range up to 114.4  gev at 95% confidence level  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", precision fits  @xcite of electroweak observables , including data from the lep and tevatron colliders , provide an indirect estimate of the higgs boson mass , assuming the sm scenario .",
    "the latest fit results give @xmath3 , or the one - sided 95% confidence - level limit @xmath4 . including the lep direct search results",
    ", this limit increases to @xmath5 .",
    "recent combined results from the tevatron experiments have , for the first time , excluded the hypothesis of a higgs boson mass around @xmath6  @xcite at 95% confidence level . although the expected sensitivity of tevatron experiments is not enough to make a 5@xmath7 discovery of the sm higgs boson  @xcite , it is enough to exclude it out up to @xmath8 at 95% confidence level , or to make a @xmath9 observation .",
    "the higgs boson production at the lhc is dominated by the gluon - gluon fusion process , described at leading order through a heavy - quark loop .",
    "the next - to - leading order cross section for this process is @xmath10 , for @xmath11 .",
    "the higgs boson can also be produced by vector boson fusion ( vbf ) with a cross section of @xmath12 , or by associated production with a @xmath0 , a @xmath1 , or a @xmath13 quark pair , with @xmath14 for the three processes and @xmath11 ( cross sections calculated at next - to - leading order using parton density function sets cteq6 m and cteq6l1  @xcite ) .",
    "the higgs boson branching ratio is strongly dependent on its mass . at @xmath15 ,",
    "the main decay mode is to a @xmath16 pair ( @xmath17 ) , followed by the decay to a @xmath18 pair ( @xmath19 ) . for a small but important interval of @xmath20",
    ", the higgs boson decays to a pair of photons with a small branching ratio . at higher masses , the decay to a pair of ( possibly off - shell ) @xmath0 or",
    "@xmath1 bosons becomes dominant .",
    "the most abundant signal topologies , containing @xmath16 pairs are unfortunately hard to separate from the large qcd background .",
    "the following gives a summary of the discovery channels being investigated at the lhc . in all cases , full detector simulation was used , which included realistic descriptions of the material budget and detector geometry .",
    "the trigger response was also realistically simulated , and systematic uncertainties were estimated .",
    "next - to - leading order cross sections were used whenever available , and used to normalise simulated event samples .",
    "this channel provides excellent sensitivity for a wide range of @xmath20 above @xmath25 , except for the interval between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where the higgs boson branching ratio is dominated by @xmath28 .",
    "the main background is @xmath29 .",
    "other backgrounds , such as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath13 , and @xmath32 are effectively suppressed by the analysis event selection .",
    "both cms and atlas rely on selecting events which contain pairs of electrons or muons with opposite charge .",
    "at least one @xmath1 is expected to be on mass shell , and the two - lepton invariant mass is used to reject fake and misidentified leptons .",
    "a clear four - lepton mass peak above a flat background is expected in this channel ( see figure  [ fig : gg_4l ] , left ) , thus allowing a good background estimation from the peak sidebands .",
    "two factors are especially significant for analyses of this channel : the lepton reconstruction efficiency and the invariant - mass resolution .",
    "both experiments show similar experimental sensitivities in this channel , with the total signal significance for each experiment expected to be in excess of 10 for an integrated luminosity of @xmath33 ( see figure  [ fig : gg_4l ] , centre ) .              in spite of the low higgs boson branching ratio to two photons ( around 0.2% for @xmath35 )",
    ", this channel shows very good sensitivity in a range of @xmath20 between the lep limit and @xmath36 .",
    "the main irreducible background is the direct @xmath37 production .",
    "signal appears as a sharp peak over a smoothly falling di - photon invariant mass distribution .",
    "reducible instrumental backgrounds such as @xmath38 and multijet production , where one or more particles are misidentified as photons , are important due to the large qcd cross sections .",
    "both experiments need to take photon conversions into account , since @xmath39 of higgs events contain at least one converted photon .",
    "both collaborations classify the selected events into several categories , according to the event kinematics or topology . in this way",
    ", the event selection can be optimized , in order to maximize the background discrimination without degrading the efficiency for selecting signal events . in atlas , a significance of about @xmath40 is expected for @xmath41 , assuming @xmath35 . with an optimized analysis employing a neural network , cms expects up to @xmath42 after collecting @xmath43 and a @xmath44 after accumulating @xmath45 ( see figure  [ fig : gg_4l ] , right ) .",
    "analyses are also being developed to target the associated production channels @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this channel currently provides one of the best sensitivities at low @xmath50 .",
    "analyses rely on the topology of vbf events to provide additional rejection against sm backgrounds . in this process",
    ", the higgs boson is radiated by @xmath0 or @xmath1 bosons exchanged between the interacting partons . due to the lack of colour flow between the two interacting partons ,",
    "the characteristic event topology consists of two relatively forward jets with a rapidity gap in between , containing little hadronic activity .",
    "both atlas and cms investigate this channel for all final states , in which at least one tau decays to an electron or muon plus neutrinos .",
    "the final state where both taus decay hadronically was also investigated by atlas and proved to be feasible , but there is as yet no detailed sensitivity estimates .",
    "the dominant background in all cases is @xmath51 with the @xmath52 boson decaying to @xmath18 .",
    "both collaborations have developed data - driven methods to estimate these backgrounds .",
    "other backgrounds are @xmath53 jets , @xmath13 , and di - jet events .",
    "the @xmath18 invariant mass reconstruction requires an approximation , in which the @xmath54 is assumed to be collinear with the visible lepton ( in @xmath55 or @xmath56 decays ) .",
    "the resulting higgs mass resolution can be observed in figure  [ fig : tau_ww ] ( left ) .",
    "the expected sensitivity for this channel , currently reaches up to @xmath44 for @xmath33 .",
    "the higgs boson decay to a @xmath60 pair provides the most sensitive search channel in the mass range @xmath61 , where this decay mode has a branching ratio above 95% .",
    "analyses have concentrated on final states containing electrons or muons from the @xmath0 decay .",
    "contrary to the remaining channels , though , the presence of high transverse momentum neutrinos makes it unfeasible to obtain a higgs mass peak .",
    "the transverse mass  @xcite can still be calculated and used in the event selection ( see figure  [ fig : tau_ww ] , right ) .",
    "analyses in this channel then need to rely on a very good knowledge of the background shape and normalisation .",
    "the dominant backgrounds come from events containing a w - boson pair , most importantly @xmath60 and @xmath13 production .",
    "the @xmath62 decay creates a correlation between the w spins in the higgs reference frame which translates into an angular correlation between the leptons emitted in the w - bosons decay .",
    "this is exploited to suppress the @xmath60 background .",
    "the @xmath13 background can be effectively suppressed by a veto on central jets ( jets with a small pseudorapidity value ) .",
    "separate analyses are performed for the cases where there are no high transverse momentum jets present in the event and where there are two additional jets , directed at the gluon fusion and the vbf production modes , respectively . for a higgs boson mass",
    "close @xmath63 a sensitivity in excess of @xmath42 is expected for each experiment for @xmath33 of integrated luminosity .",
    "additional channels being explored are the vbf @xmath64 and the associated production channels @xmath65 and @xmath48 .",
    "the expected sensitivity of atlas and cms to a sm higgs boson was evaluated by both collaborations .",
    "analyses in both experiments show similar sensitivity in most channels .",
    "the sensitivity for sm higgs discovery in the various channels is illustrated by figure  [ fig : sensitivity ] for the cms case .",
    "an integrated luminosity of less than @xmath66 should be enough to make a @xmath44 discovery in the mass range above the lep limit .",
    "preliminary atlas studies indicate that an integrated luminosity of @xmath67 would be enough to exclude the higgs boson in the range @xmath68 at 95% confidence level .",
    "other analyses , not described here , may contribute to further enhancements of the sensitivity .",
    "the author would like to express his thanks to atlas and cms colleagues .",
