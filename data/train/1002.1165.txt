    "a large amount of experimental data from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite strongly suggest that a novel form of matter , a strongly coupled quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) , may have been formed in the central region of high - energy heavy - ion collisions . among the experimental evidences for the formation of sqgp",
    "are the jet quenching phenomena that include the strong suppression of hadron spectra with large transverse momentum in central @xmath6 collisions as compared to @xmath7 collisions @xcite and the disappearance of back - to - back correlations of large transverse momentum hadrons  @xcite .",
    "these jet quenching patterns observed at rhic are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for jet quenching  @xcite or suppression of large transverse momentum hadrons as a consequence of parton energy loss and medium modified parton fragmentation functions induced by multiple scattering as partons propagate through the dense medium after their initial production .",
    "the parton energy loss and medium modification of the fragmentation functions due to multiple parton scattering and induced gluon bremsstrahlung are controlled by the jet transport parameter @xcite , @xmath8 or the average squared transverse momentum broadening per unit length for a jet in color representation @xmath9 , which is also related to the gluon distribution density of the medium@xcite and therefore characterizes the medium property as probed by an energetic jet . here",
    "we consider a picture in which the jet parton interacts with medium particles or quasi - particles with cross section @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the local particle density of the medium .",

    "we will study in particular the effect of collective expansion , transverse flow , non - equilibrium and most importantly jet quenching in the hadronic phase of the bulk matter .",
    "since the jet transport parameter is related to the gluon distribution density of the bulk medium , one expects it to be different in a qgp and hadronic matter .",

    "the radial flow velocity in the center of the dense medium ( left panel ) , where jet quenching is the strongest , remains small , at about 0.2 , throughout hydrodynamic expansion . in the same figure",
    ", we also plot the fraction of the hadron phase ( solid lines ) as a function of time in the ( 1 + 3)d hydrodynamics .",
    "the period between @xmath137 and @xmath181 indicate the duration of the phase transition or the mixed phase .",
    "we notice that at the beginning of the mixed phase the radial flow velocity starts to saturate and even decrease a little .",
    "this is mainly due to the mass effect .",
    "the energy , approximately @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the transverse mass , should be the same during the phase transition .",
    "therefore , the radial flow velocity will decrease as particles become massive during the phase transition .",
    "such decrease will be partially compensated by the continued collective expansion which tend to increase the flow velocity .",
    "as the phase transition is completed , the radial flow velocity should increase again by further transverse expansion in the hadronic phase and the resonances decays .",
    "the radial flow will reduce the effective jet transport parameter @xmath0 if jets propagate along with it while increase the effective value of @xmath0 if jets propagate against it . after averaging over the direction and initial position of jet production ,",
    "the effective jet transport parameter is merely reduced by less than 14% @xcite .",
    "as shown in table [ table1 ] , this leads to an increase of @xmath2 about 14% when one includes the effect of radial flow in the ( 1 + 3)d hydrodynamic evolution in fitting experimental data on @xmath180 .    in both ( 1 + 1)d bjorken and two options of the ( 1 + 3)d hydrodynamic expansion as discussed above",

    "[ fig : qhat ] , and the jet transport parameter in the hadronic phase in the later stage of the bulk medium evolution will be smaller than the scenario of no pt in the ( 1 + 3)d hydrodynamics .",
    "therefore , one needs a larger value of the initial jet transport parameter @xmath2 , about 13% , to account for the measured suppression factor @xmath180 as compared to an evolving bulk medium with the same jet transport parameter throughout difference phases .    to determine the contribution of jet quenching in the hadronic phase",

    ", the extracted @xmath159 will be about 44% larger ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the hadronic phase contributes to about 44% of the total suppression of the high @xmath155 hadron spectra .",
    "such a large contribution is due to the lifetime of the mixed and hadronic phase until the kinetic freeze - out which is longer than the lifetime of the qgp phase , though the hadron density is much smaller than the initial parton density in the qgp phase .",
    "a better understanding of the hadronic contribution to the jet quenching is , therefore , important for an accurate extraction of the jet transport parameter in the initial phase of strongly interacting qgp .      in a parton cascade model such as bamps",
    ", the system takes times to reach thermal or partial thermal equilibrium after the initial parton production time , @xmath187 fm/@xmath59 . during this period of parton equilibration",
    ", there is entropy production accompanied by rapid expansion .",
    "the net effect is a much faster decreasing of the effective temperature @xcite and the parton density during the early stage of the bulk medium evolution .",
    "the corresponding jet transport parameter in the equilibrating gluonic matter in bamps calculation therefore decreases much faster than that in both ( 1 + 1)d and ( 1 + 3)d ideal hydrodynamic models in the early stage of evolution as shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : qhat ] .",
    "it is smaller by more than a factor of 2 before the hadronization .",
    "this leads to about 77% increase in the initial value of @xmath2 that is needed to account for the measured suppression of hadron spectra ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "note that in our calculations jet quenching starts at the thermalization @xmath160 fm/@xmath59 in the ideal hydrodynamic model .",
    "however , it starts at @xmath188 fm/@xmath59 in the bamps model immediately after the initial gluons are produced and before thermal or partial thermal equilibrium is reached . such jet medium interaction and",
    "parton energy loss during the thermalization stage in the bamps model will contribute to some additional , though a small fraction , suppression of the final hadron spectra .    in bamps ,",
    "the hadronization of the gluonic matter happens when the local gluon energy density is below @xmath189 and parton - hadron duality is used for the phase - space density of hadrons , which are assumed to freeze out immediately .",
    "such a sudden hadronization and freeze - out scenario implies the change of the hadron fraction @xmath152 from 0 to 1 at this critical density in the evaluation of the jet transport parameter in eq .",
    "( [ q - hat - qgph ] ) .",
    "the lack of the mixed phase in bamps , which lasts for about @xmath190 fm/@xmath59 in the ( 1 + 3)d ideal hydrodynamic evolution as indicated by the duration for the hadron fraction to reach @xmath181 in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] , leads to smaller value of the jet transport parameter after the hadronization . comparing the extracted values of @xmath2 from the phenomenological fit with and without ( @xmath191 ) hadronic phase as shown in table  [ table1 ] ,",
    "the hadronic interaction in bamps model contributes to about 22% of the jet quenching effect , which is about a factor 2 smaller than that in the ( 1 + 3)d ideal hydrodynamical model .",
    "the large viscous effect in the parton cascade model @xcite generally leads to larger radial flow velocity than that generated by an ideal hydrodynamic expansion as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] . the free - streaming of hadrons immediately after the hadronization also leads to the further increase of the flow velocity . such larger radial flow velocity in the bamps model",
    "reduces the effective jet quenching parameter and therefore leads an increase of about 16% in the extracted initial @xmath2 .",
    "the decrease of the radial flow velocity at late times seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] is a numerical artifact , which comes from the chosen geometry of spatial elements , where particles are collected to calculate the radial flow velocity .",
    "longitudinal length of each spatial element corresponds to a space time rapidity window @xmath192 , while the transverse length is fixed to be 0.3 fm . at late times",
    "the longitudinal length is larger than the transverse one , and particles with smaller transverse velocity ( larger longitudinal velocity ) make up the main part of remaining particles in the spatial elements .",
    "this is the reason for the observed decrease of the radial flow velocity .",
    "if we choose the longitudinal length being equal as the transverse one at the late times , we would see a continuous increase of the flow velocity due to the free - streaming , before all particles go out of the spatial element .",
    "this is , however , a negligible effect on the extraction of @xmath2 , because the hadron density is tiny at late times .",
    "using medium - modified fragmentation functions from the high - twist approach to multiple parton scattering we have calculated single inclusive hadron spectra in nlo perturbative qcd parton model .",
    "the medium modification to the fragmentation function is very similar in form to the dglap correction due to vacuum gluon bremsstrahlung , except that the medium modified splitting function contains information about the properties of the medium through a path - integrated jet transport parameter @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the medium modified fragmentation function will explicitly depend on the space - time evolution of the bulk medium .",
    "we have focused our attention on the dependence of the medium modified fragmentation function on the space - time evolution of the bulk medium and their influence on the suppression of the single hadron spectra at large @xmath155 .",
    "we specifically considered the effects of transverse expansion , radial flow , jet quenching in hadronic phase and non - equilibrium effect with three different models for the bulk matter evolution in central @xmath6 collisions at the rhic energy : ( 1 + 1)d bjorken hydrodynamic model , ( 1 + 3)d ideal hydrodynamical model by hirano @xcite and ( 1 + 3)d bamps @xcite parton cascade model .",
    "since the jet transport parameter is proportional to the particle gluon distribution density of the medium , we have assumed that it will be proportional to the local particle density in both qgp and hadronic phase during the bulk matter evolution .",
    "the coefficient of the particle density dependence , which is related to soft gluon distribution per particle , will be different in the qgp and hadronic phase . assuming a similar density dependence of the jet transport parameter in the hadronic phase as that in a large cold nuclei , but rescaled by the local hadron density and the number of constituent quarks , the only free parameter in the space - time profile is the initial value of the jet transport parameter @xmath2 at initial time @xmath3 at the center of the qgp medium in central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we have extracted values of @xmath159 at @xmath179 in each model of bulk evolution with different options by fitting the experimental data on the suppression factor @xmath180 for high @xmath155 neutral pions and studied the uncertainties in the extracted value of @xmath2 .    by comparing the values of @xmath2",
    "extracted with different options in models for the bulk evolution , we also found that the transverse expansion leads to fast cooling of the hot medium and therefore reduces jet quenching in the later stage of the evolution by about 17% .",
    "radial flow also reduces the effective jet transport parameter by 15% . the phase transition from qgp to hadronic medium",
    "further reduces the effective jet transport parameter in the hadronic phase and leads to about 13% reduction of jet quenching effect . within our model for the form of jet transport parameter due to jet - hadron interaction ,",
    "the overall contribution to jet quenching from hadronic phase is about 22 - 44% , depending on the model for evolution of the hadronic phase .    by comparing ( 1 + 3)d ideal hydrodynamic and the bamps parton cascade model",
    ", we found that the non - equilibrium evolution in the early stage of parton cascade leads to faster decrease of the jet transport parameter with time and therefore affects the overall jet quenching the most by 77% , part of which is caused by the lack of mixed phase in the parton cascade model .",
    "such uncertainties can be further reduced by combining parton cascade and hadron cascade with a model of of hadronization that can reproduce the eos during the phase transition as given by lattice qcd calculation .",
