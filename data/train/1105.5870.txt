    "massive black holes in the cores of group and cluster - centered galaxies become active when a tiny mass of cluster gas is accreted , causing large amounts of `` feedback '' energy to be deposited in the surrounding cluster gas .",
    "the energy provided by occasional feedback events , in the form of jets containing supra - thermal and relativistic particles , increases the entropy of both nearby and very distant cluster gas .",
    "feedback jets create expanding , shock - driving cavities in the hot cluster gas , increasing its entropy and delaying its flow toward the black hole by radiation losses . in the absence of feedback ,",
    "the loss of entropy by thermal x - radiation is accompanied by a slow cooling inflow toward the black hole which , if unabated over time , would concentrate a mass of centrally cooled gas in or near the central black hole far exceeding limits set by stellar velocities and other observations .",
    "for example , intermittent cavities formed from feedback events of energy @xmath3 ergs every @xmath4 years at 10 kpc can arrest the currently observed gas density and temperature profiles ( and low central cooling ) in the virgo cluster for @xmath5 gyrs ( mathews 2009 ) . including more distant feedback events at @xmath6 kpc can maintain the observed gas profiles and low cooling rate for several additional gyrs .",
    "entropy and cosmic rays delivered to the cluster gas by feedback episodes cause gas to flow out in the cluster potential , offsetting the cooling inflow .    in general",
    ", however , central black holes are unable to provide the optimal or minimum feedback energy that must be deposited at every radius in the cluster gas just sufficient to shut down black hole accretion of locally cooling gas . instead",
    ", black holes typically over - react in a clumsy fashion , depositing much more energy than the minimum required , much of it in distant regions of the cluster where the radiative cooling time exceeds the age of the cluster .",
    "after a few @xmath7 yrs following a feedback event most of the feedback energy converts to potential energy , as the entire gaseous cluster atmosphere adiabatically expands outward ( mathews & brighenti 2008 ) . consequently , the increased cluster gas entropy is necessarily related to a reduction of the cluster gas density relative to the local dark matter .",
    "we discuss here an approximate estimation of the total feedback energy received by cluster gas during the cluster lifetime by comparing gas potential energy profiles in observed clusters with that of idealized gas density distributions resulting from `` adiabatic '' gravitational collapse into the cluster halo in the absence of radiative cooling and associated feedback .",
    "we show that this energy , @xmath8 ergs , far exceeds the energy lost by radiation during the cluster lifetime and consequently the minimum energy required merely to stop the cooling inflow .",
    "the collective energy from all supernovae also provides a negligible fraction of the total feedback energy .",
    "since only 10 percent of the hot baryonic gas in massive clusters cools to form stars , star formation can also be ignored in our estimate of the global energetics of the cluster gas where we seek an overall accuracy of @xmath9% .",
    "estimates of the total feedback energy from cluster - centered black holes are possible for two reasons .",
    "first , the potential energy of cluster gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in a fixed dark halo potential can be found by integrating outward from the cluster center .",
    "second , to a good approximation , the formation of dark halos and their gravitational potential proceeds from the inside outward as the size of the virialized region in the dark halo increases with time . in view of this latter point",
    ", it is possible to estimate the increase in potential energy of the cluster gas due to feedback without knowing when the feedback occurred .",
    "we begin by estimating the current gas density , temperature , mass , entropy and potential energy profiles expected at zero redshift in the absence of radiative losses , star formation , and black hole feedback , referred to as the `` adiabatic '' cluster atmosphere .",
    "then , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , potential energy profiles are estimated from gas distributions in observed clusters having the same total mass . when comparing the difference between the potential energy evaluated at the same mass of cluster gas with and without feedback , we find that hot gas in the idealized adiabatic atmosphere must expand significantly to resemble cluster gas profiles currently observed . the total feedback energy associated with this expansion , @xmath10 ergs , comfortably exceeds energies of the most powerful known individual feedback events .",
    "central to our feedback energy estimate is the inverse relationship between increasing cluster gas entropy and decreasing gas fraction , the ratio of gas to total cluster densities , which is lowered by a global expansion of the cluster gas .",
    "if this feedback energy is released during periods of radiatively efficient central accretion with @xmath11 of the accreted mass returned as feedback energy to the cluster gas , we find that the final black hole masses in large clusters would exceed those observed . alternatively",
    ", the feedback energy may be provided from the rotational energy of rapidly spinning central black holes .",
    "a key element in our estimate is an assertion that adiabatic ( non - radiating , non - feedback ) gaseous cluster atmospheres can be fit with the same properly normalized nfw profile as the dark matter . among the many computations of galaxy cluster formation that include both baryons and dark matter , surprisingly few have analyzed in detail the deep similarity between the final adiabatic gas structure and the radial nfw distribution of dark matter .",
    "notable exceptions to this are the density and entropy profiles in dark halos and adiabatic gas described in the cosmological cluster formation calculations of eke , navarro & frenk ( 1998 ) and in particular faltenbacher et al .",
    "the cluster gas entropy can be characterized with @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gas density and @xmath14^{1/2}$ ] is the thermal velocity dispersion . by analogy ,",
    "faltenbacher et al .",
    "define a corresponding dark matter entropy @xmath15 for which @xmath13 is the dark matter density and @xmath16 is the 3d velocity dispersion of collisionless dark matter particles .",
    "the detailed cosmological cluster calculations of faltenbacher et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using gadget2 reveal that , apart from a small central gaseous core , the gas density and entropy profiles in the adiabatic case share identical , appropriately scaled nfw profiles regardless of cluster mass . beyond the central core where @xmath17 , both @xmath18 and @xmath19 vary as powerlaws , @xmath20 , but with slightly different normalizations , @xmath21",
    "however , as discussed by faltenbacher et al . , the final zero redshift gas configuration in the gas contains residual subsonic macroscopic velocities which , if damped , would bring the gas and dark matter entropies into near perfect agreement , @xmath22 .",
    "we adopt the assumption , implicit in the discussion of faltenbacher et al .",
    ", that the two entropies are in fact equal but the gas remains undamped because the appropriate physical damping mechanisms are absent from gadget2 . the artificial viscosity in this code that damps the accretion shock may require an unphysically long time to damp the residual subsonic velocity field .",
    "assuming @xmath23 is also more consistent with the smaller @xmath24% component of turbulent energy found for relaxed clusters in recent cosmological simulations using the enzo code ( vazza et al .",
    "finally , cluster virial masses are determined from observed gas pressure profiles without allowing for undamped kinetic energy and its associated pressure .",
    "this assumption ( which underestimates the virial mass ) is also consistent with @xmath23 .",
    "while it is comforting that the radial profiles of adiabatic gas and dark matter are nearly identical , this may nonetheless be surprising due to the very different nature of their dissipative mechanisms .",
    "of more relevance to our discussion is the similar nfw shape of adiabatic gas and dark matter density profiles .",
    "the assumption @xmath23 ensures that the adiabatic gas has experienced the same dissipative history as the dark matter .    the radial dark matter nfw distribution is shaped by all entropy - producing dissipations that occurred during both smooth accretion of diffuse dark matter as well as inhomogeneous accretion of smaller groups , clusters and filaments that merged into the final cluster potential .",
    "the entropy increases that accompanied the formation of these smaller structures are also embedded in the final nfw structure .",
    "furthermore , the results of faltenbacher et al .",
    "( 2007 ) indicate that all dissipative information about the cluster merger history is also encoded in the nfw gas density profiles in idealized adiabatic baryon atmospheres formed by gravity alone .",
    "when computing purely gravitational ( adiabatic ) collapse in cosmological calculations without radiation or feedback , a controversy has arisen in recent years concerning differences in the dissipation between dark matter and baryons in cluster cores where @xmath17 ( recently reviewed by borgani & kravtsov 2009 ; springel 2010 ; vazza 2011 ) . in mesh - based calculations",
    "the baryons are found to have large , well - resolved central density cores which are larger than those computed with smoothed particle hydrodynamics .",
    "possible origins for this discrepancy have been proposed and discussed by mitchell et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and vazza ( 2011 ) . for our purposes here",
    "we assume two limiting adiabatic gas density profiles following pure gravitational baryonic collapse into dark halos : core and no core .",
    "consider first the `` no core '' case in which baryons and dark matter suffer the same dissipation so the post - collapse gas density profile is identical to that of the total density but scaled down by the universal baryon fraction @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 ( e.g. faltenbacher et al . 2007 ) where @xmath27 is the total density dominated by dark matter .",
    "we seek the idealized radial structure of cluster gas formed without feedback or radiative losses and which has evolved to the current time .",

    "( 2006 ) . for our purposes",
    "we choose massive clusters in which the full impact of feedback energy can be absorbed and which do not presently have huge cavities that dominate and disrupt the cluster gas profiles observed .",

    "we choose an initial temperature at some very small cluster radius and seek solutions for which the gas entropy @xmath54 varies like a self - similar power law at large radius @xmath55 , similar to entropy profiles in detailed adiabatic gravitational collapse computations ( e.g. tozzi & norman 2001 ; voit et al . 2005 ) .",

    ", an exact value and solution can be found for which @xmath56 where @xmath57 remains constant over a large range of cluster radius near the virial radius and beyond .",
    "the value of @xmath58 emerges naturally from the solution as an eigenvalue that is not imposed in advance .",
    "solid lines in figures 1 and 2 show adiabatic post - collapse profiles of gas temperature , entropy and density respectively for composite clusters 1 and 2 found by integrating equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the hydrostatic post - collapse cluster gas atmospheres in figures 1 and 2 have a broad temperature maximum near @xmath59 and distant entropy profiles @xmath60 that are very similar to the tozzi - norman computation .",
    "our simple approximation closely resembles sophisticated cluster gas profiles computed in detailed cosmological simulations that include mergers of smaller bound systems and gas inflowing in filaments ( e.g. borgani & kravtsov 2009 ) .",
    "gas and dark matter in these merging sub - systems and filaments have already experienced some dissipation when they enter the cluster virial radius .",
    "apart from this we consider no other type of hypothetical ad hoc pre - heating .",
    "next we perform similar integrations using the observed cluster gas density profiles @xmath61 , approximately including the gas self - gravity in the total nfw mass distribution .",
    "the data points shown with open circles in figures 1 and 2 show observed gas densities found from @xmath62 for both clusters in each composite cluster at radii for which @xmath63 is determined by vikhlinin et al .",
    "in addition we show ( with filled circles ) several additional approximate values measured directly from the @xmath61 profiles plotted by vikhlinin et al .",

    "however , due to the increased volume available in the outer regions of the clusters , we expect the excess @xmath71 to be much less than @xmath72 and difficult to observe .",

    "while the two cluster atmospheres plotted in figures 1 and 2  adiabatic and observed  are final zero - redshift gas distributions , we can also regard them as initial and final configurations of the cluster gas before and after feedback energy is deposited .",
    "of particular interest is the potential energy of the gas at various radii in the two atmospheres that enclose the same integrated gas mass @xmath81 .",

    "note that the potential energy profile is determined by an integration out from the cluster center . furthermore , to a good approximation",
    ", the cluster dark matter density and potential profiles remain fixed with time as the the size and mass of the virialized region increases with time , i.e. the mass distribution in virialized dark halos forms from the inside out .",
    "the inside - out character of halo formation is apparent for example from figure 1 of diemand , kuhlen , madau ( 2007 ) who plot the accumulated density within many lagrangian mass zones with time as a dark halo grows in size and mass . in view of this , our estimate of the change in @xmath86 due to non - gravitational feedback , assuming an unchanging total nfw mass distribution , is independent of the time when the feedback occurred .",
    "as the dark halo grows , the global outflow of cluster gas driven by feedback energy can relocate the accretion shock beyond the instantaneous virial radius .",
    "but we do not consider extremely distant feedback events ( @xmath87 ) that energize gas before it reaches the accretion shock and where the nfw potential may no longer apply .",
    "this restriction on feedback seems reasonable , particularly since the virial radius continuously increases with time and it is consistent with the gradual radial increase in @xmath63 toward @xmath72 observed in cluster gas .",

    "it is seen that the radius that encloses all the gas within the virial radius in the pre - feedback adiabatic cluster increases by about a factor 1.9 ( cluster 1 ) or 1.5 ( cluster 2 ) as the cluster gas expands due to feedback energy .",
    "this expansion has been verified by george et al .",

    "the mean luminosity of this enormous feedback energy , if spread over a typical cluster lifetime @xmath90 gyrs , is @xmath91 erg s@xmath44 , comparable to continuously active quasars .      in a second series of similar calculations , we consider adiabatic collapse atmospheres in which the baryons experience an additional central dissipation that produces a density core . for this purpose",

    "are simply removed without a corresponding increase in @xmath63 beyond the core region .",
    "corrections of this sort that must occur for baryon conservation , and which are not apparent in the mesh - based calculations , are not important for our estimate here since the baryon fraction in the cored adiabatic atmosphere is essentially @xmath25 at large cluster radii . finally , we assume that adiabatic cored density profiles are a universal function , scaling with @xmath96 for clusters of different virial masses . performing similar integrations of the hydrostatic equation ( 1 ) ,",

    "while a few recent cluster x - ray observations with the _ suzaku _ telescope extend to the virial radius and beyond ( e.g. george et al . 2009 ) , these data may be more difficult to interpret .",
    "detailed calculations of the cosmological evolution of massive clusters often indicate significant undamped subsonic gas velocities beyond about @xmath100 , which may degrade the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ( evrard et al . 1996 ) .",

    "the mass of gas within the cooling radius in the observed cluster atmosphere , by definition of @xmath145 , is expected to flow inward at an average rate @xmath158 .",
    "consequently , in the presence of both radiative losses and feedback gains , feedback from the central black hole is expected to increase until the time - averaged rate that gas mass is driven outward past @xmath145 balances the average rate that mass would cool and flow inward past @xmath145 over the cluster lifetime .",
    "this balance is shown in figure 5 where the total time - averaged rate that mass flows out past the cooling radius , @xmath159 very nearly matches the approximate mean inflow rate @xmath158 expected ( from eqn .",
    "8) at radius @xmath145 during time @xmath154 if radiative cooling within this radius is uninhibited by feedback .",
    "since inflow @xmath156 ( estimated from @xmath157 without feedback ) and outflow @xmath160 ( estimated without radiation losses ) have opposite signs , the near equality of their magnitudes at @xmath161 in figure 5 indicates that feedback and cooling are balanced within @xmath145 .",
    "a quasi - steady state is established with little or no net gas flow across @xmath145 , although feedback outflow continues in @xmath162 unaffected by radiation losses .",
    "the important agreement between opposing mass flows at @xmath145 shown in figure 5 is a further confirmation of the self - consistency our simple feedback estimates",
    ". less than 1 percent of the total feedback energy is stored as potential energy within the cooling radius .",
    "nevertheless , central black holes  in their over - zealous , over - reaching efforts to feed back to the cluster atmosphere the energy acquired from gas cooling in their immediate vicinity  drive huge flows of gas out beyond the virial radius , but in the process necessarily provide enough mass outflow within the relatively small cooling radius to shut down the large cooling inflow that would otherwise occur in this critical central region . although we do not consider the detailed time evolution of the initial adiabatic cluster gas profile as it transforms into the gas density profiles observed today , we imagine that this occurs in a quasi - steady manner , as explained above , in which feedback energy is widely distributed as @xmath86 in the cluster gas . by this",
    "means the feedback outflow always nearly balances the radiative inflow , avoiding any large central gas concentration ( and eventual overdensity due to star formation ) or other excursions very far from the gas density profiles currently observed .",
    "it is likely that feedback consists of jets and jet - produced cavities that are filled mostly with cosmic rays .",
    "if so , it is interesting to compare the total feedback energy in our composite clusters , @xmath8 ergs , with that expected from other cluster cosmic ray sources . for simplicity , consider proton cosmic rays that have cluster lifetimes comparable to the cluster age and compare the total ( proton ) cosmic ray energy from feedback shocks to the much stronger accretion shock that produced the underlying entropy gradients in cluster atmospheres . from table 2",
    "the total potential energy of gas within the virial radius in clusters 1 and 2 is @xmath163 ergs so the total thermal energy is @xmath164 ergs by the virial theorem .",
    "the virial temperature and entropy in the cluster gas are acquired in the accretion shock as the cluster formed .",
    "typically , about 10% of the shock energy is converted to cosmic rays .",
    "so the total energy in cosmic rays created as the cluster formed is @xmath165 ergs .",
    "therefore , the cosmic ray energy from feedback and cluster accretion are comparable .    the thermal energy profiles in our adiabatic , pre - feedback cluster models ( upper panels in figs",
    ". 1 - 4 ) change very little after receiving the enormous feedback energies we consider . in our scenario",
    "almost all of the thermal energy created when feedback energy is initially deposited subsequently becomes potential energy as the cluster gas expands ; this is the energy evolution described in mathews & brighenti ( 2008 ) .",
    "more likely , most of the feedback energy is supplied from the central black holes as jets of supra - thermal cosmic rays that drive the shocks that increase the cluster gas entropy .",
    "when feedback is mostly in the form of cosmic rays , the net thermal energy of the cluster gas is subsequently reduced by cluster expansion more than it is initially increased by shock waves and the net effect of cavity production is to cool , not heat , the cluster gas ( mathews & brighenti 2008 ) .",
    "agn feedback energy and cavity production in cosmological calculations are assumed to be in the form of ultra - hot thermal gas .",
    "this injection of thermal energy results in a small net increase in the total thermal energy of the cluster gas even after it has fully expanded .",
    "since we do not explicitly consider the non - thermal cosmic ray component here , a very small increase ( rather than a decrease ) in the post - feedback temperature profiles appears in figures 1 - 4 . in either case ,",
    "any small change in the thermal energy of the cluster gas can be neglected in our estimates of the total feedback energy .",
    "it is important to recognize the distinction between the location in cluster gas where entropy - increasing feedback energy is deposited and where it is ultimately stored as potential energy which is what we address here . evidently most feedback heating occurs in shock waves moving away from advancing jets and expanding x - ray cavities .",
    "x - ray observations of these shocks generally indicate modest mach numbers , @xmath166 , in which the gas entropy is increased only by @xmath167 . the lower density of recently shock - heated gas results in an adiabatic , buoyant outward flow in the cluster that stops when the entropy of the heated region matches that of the ambient atmosphere .",
    "however , the entropy increases with cluster radius as @xmath55 mostly due to dissipation acquired during cosmic accretion .",
    "consequently , gas heated with a @xmath168 shock can only rise by a factor of @xmath169 in cluster radius where its feedback energy is stored as potential energy .",
    "conversely , if the reduced gas fraction observed at @xmath170 mpc were due to shock heating events at 50 kpc ( where x - ray cavities can be observed ) , the entropy difference @xmath171 would require shocks with mach numbers @xmath172 in which the post - shock temperature would be increased by about 95 .",
    "shocks this strong have not been observed in cluster gas .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that there is not enough cluster gas within 50 kpc which , when continuously heated this much with a filling factor of unity , can buoyantly supply the much larger mass of high entropy , feedback heated gas observed at 1 mpc .",
    "in addition , mixing instabilities are likely to dilute the entropy of heated gas during their long buoyant journey to @xmath173 mpc . clearly , long range buoyant outflow is a losing proposition .",
    "the conclusion we draw from this is that feedback energy stored at some radius always exceeds the radius where the energy was initially deposited , but the difference between these two radii is unlikely to be very large .",
    "the time - averaged mechanical feedback power @xmath174 required to lift the adiabatic cluster atmospheres beyond the virial radius @xmath121 can be estimated from @xmath175 where @xmath129 gyrs is a typical age for large clusters .",
    "for composite cluster ( 1,2 ) the feedback luminosity with and without initial cores is @xmath176 and @xmath177 erg s@xmath44 respectively .",
    "these luminosities are comparable to those of powerful quasars continuously active during the cluster lifetime .",
    "what are the implications of these enormous feedback powers for the mass of cluster - centered black holes ?",
    "the conversion of accretion energy into black hole mass is more straightforward for luminous quasars in which the ( thin ) accretion disk can be directly observed . in this case , the total bolometric feedback energy radiated by an active black hole is related to the mass of the black hole by @xmath178 with @xmath179 ( e.g. davis & laor 2010 ) . while low redshift cluster - centered black holes generally have bolometric luminosities very much less than the estimated @xmath174 ,",
    "it is unclear if this also applies at higher redshift when most of the feedback energy may have been created .",
    "suppose we adopt a mechanical feedback efficiency @xmath180 such that the change in cluster gas potential energy is related to mass accretion by @xmath181 if we identify the total mass accreted with the mass of the black hole , @xmath182 , and assume @xmath183 , the resulting black hole masses for cluster 1 , @xmath184 @xmath1 , are similar to those observed in cluster - centered galaxies , e.g. @xmath185 @xmath1 in m87 at the center of the virgo cluster ( gebhardt & thomas 2009 ) .",
    "however , the corresponding black hole masses for the more massive cluster 2 , @xmath186 @xmath1 , exceed those observed .",
    "this large black hole mass can not be reduced by invoking the energy contributed to the cluster gas from accreting black holes in bulges of non - central satellite galaxies in the cluster .",
    "almost all observed x - ray cavities and shock waves are associated with cluster - centered black holes , not those in orbiting satellite galaxies .",
    "moreover , the cluster center is where the virialized cluster gas is densest and has the shortest radiative cooling time .",
    "however , for cluster masses @xmath187 @xmath1 , such as we consider here , the mass of the central galaxy ( and therefore also its black hole ) increases very little with increasing cluster virial mass @xmath32 ( lin & mohr 2004 ) .",
    "the mass of the central black hole in cluster a478 ( in composite cluster 2 ) estimated from the bulge luminosity of the cluster - centered galaxy , @xmath188 @xmath1 ( mcnamara , rohanizadegan , & nulsen 2011 ) , is considerably less than the mass estimated from @xmath189 @xmath1 with @xmath190 for the cored cluster 2 .",
    "finally , the mechanical accretion efficiency @xmath180 can not be much larger than 0.1 and is likely to be much smaller .",
    "this difficulty can be alleviated if a substantial fraction of the required mechanical feedback energy is supplied by the rotational energy of central black holes which , when magnetically coupled to accretion disks , may form powerful feedback jets ( blandford & znajaek 1977 ) .",
    "the maximum available energy from a rotating black hole , @xmath191 $ ] erg , is large enough to account for the gas depletion in both clusters 1 and 2 .",
    "recent models of the cosmological co - evolution of galaxies and their black holes are consistent with the assumption that `` radio mode '' jet feedback derives from black hole spin and low - luminosity , advection - dominated central accretion ( sikora , stawarz , & lasota , 2007 ; fanidakis et al .",
    "there is considerable evidence for mechanical outflow from active galaxies and quasars ( e.g. crenshaw et al . 2003 ) , but most relevant to our feedback estimates here are powerful frii radio sources in luminous quasars that can transport enormous energies to great distances in the cluster gas ( e.g. mullin et al . 2008 ) . recently singal et al .",
    "( 2011 ) argue that the evolution of quasar luminosities at optical and radio frequencies are strongly correlated since redshift @xmath192 with a significantly higher radio than optical evolution . in all likelihood ,",
    "most of the radio - mode feedback energy from cluster - centered black holes probably occurred at earlier times .",
    "while spin energy is an attractive hypothesis , it must be reconciled with the approximately isotropic ejection of feedback jet energy currently observed in local galaxy clusters such as virgo and perseus and the rather large number of frii radio sources with multiple hotspots , both of which , on the spin hypothesis , would indicate abrupt changes in the massive black hole spin axis on timescales that are implausibly small .    throughout this discussion",
    "we assume that the huge energy required to drive down cluster gas fractions originates in ( cluster - centered ) black holes .",
    "while other as yet unidentified sources of energy can not be excluded , a cluster - centered energy source seems likely .",
    "the largest bipolar x - ray cavities associated with feedback from cluster centers require energies @xmath193 ergs ( mcnamara et al . 2005 ; guo & mathews 2010b ) that are a significant fraction of the total feedback energies we estimate . strong _",
    "ad hoc _ preheating of baryons to a fixed adiabat before they flow across the cluster virial radius produces a characteristic entropy `` floor '' that may be inconsistent with the mass of gas observed in smaller group and galaxy potentials . to produce the quasi - powerlaw entropy profiles observed in clusters ( dotted lines in figs . 1 - 4 )",
    "the preheated gas would need to be differentially heated in a fine - tuned manner , varying with redshift .",
    "in their recent paper pratt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) plot entropy and gas fraction profiles for over 30 nearby clusters observed with _ xmm - newton _ , confirming the strong anti - correlation between these two parameters . when the mean entropy @xmath194 increases , the gas fraction @xmath195 decreases and the amplitude of this behavior increases with decreasing cluster gas temperature and @xmath32 as expected .",
    "but , in an interesting departure from previous work , in their figure 9 pratt et al .",
    "plot a combination of the normalized entropy and the integrated , mass - weighted gas fraction @xmath196(f_g(<r)/f_b)^{2/3}$ ] with @xmath197 , showing that the previously discordant profiles for @xmath198 among their 30 clusters all collapse almost magically into a single tight bundle of correlations right along the relation expected for adiabatic baryonic collapse , @xmath199 for @xmath200 .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate a similar result with our composite clusters 1 and 2 .",
    "the upper panels in figures 1 and 2 for `` no core '' clusters demonstrate that the gas temperature varies with cluster radius very much less than the observed or adiabatic entropy @xmath201 in the central panels .",
    "the steady increase in entropy with cluster radius is due almost entirely to its reciprocal relation to decreasing gas density .",
    "moreover , the gas densities for the adiabatic and observed clusters vary with the total cluster density as @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "consequently , the adiabatic gas density at any radius is related to the observed density by @xmath204 where @xmath25 . using this relation , the local entropy in our adiabatic",
    ", feedback - free clusters can be approximately written in terms of the entropy in the observed cluster at the same radius , @xmath205_{obs}(f_g / f_b)^{2/3}$ ] , where @xmath206 .",
    "dash - dotted lines in the central panels of figures 1 and 2 show profiles of @xmath207 which are almost identical to the solid line profiles for the adiabatic atmosphere , @xmath208 .",
    "this is the result found by pratt et al .",
    "although we use the more appropriate local gas mass fraction @xmath209 to show that @xmath210 , the gas mass - weighted values of the integrated gas fractions @xmath211 used by pratt et al .",
    "are not greatly different from local values @xmath209 because the gas mass increases rather rapidly with cluster radius . like pratt et al .",
    "we find that the observed entropy profiles for both clusters 1 and 2 collapse back to the adiabatic profiles when the observed density is increased by @xmath212 .",
    "what is the physical significance of this result ?",
    "it is not surprising that the gas densities between observed and adiabatic atmospheres are related by @xmath213 since this is required by the definition of these two atmospheres .",
    "however , the close agreement between @xmath214 and @xmath208 is possible because the gas temperature profiles in the observed and adiabatic atmospheres ( bound by the same virial mass ) are virtually identical in clusters 1 and 2 . to an excellent approximation ,",
    "the observed and adiabatic entropy differ locally only because of the differing gas densities .",
    "it is also interesting that the entropy profiles of all clusters observed by pratt et al .  and possibly all known clusters",
    " can be modified in this way to recover the universal adiabatic profile .",
    "clusters for which @xmath215 are relaxed in the sense that non - gravitational `` heating '' events that increase the cluster gas entropy and drive it out in the cluster potential , lowering the gas fraction , are either too weak or too old to retain evidence of increased gas temperature due to the most recent feedback event .",
    "conversely , clusters for which @xmath214 slightly exceeds @xmath208 show evidence of recent feedback - related increases in gas temperature and @xmath216 is a measure of the location , energy and age of these feedback events .",
    "by considering the difference between gas density profiles in clusters created by non - radiating gravitational collapse and similar observed clusters , we estimate the total feedback energy received by the gas during the cluster lifetime . this estimate is insensitive to the precise time of the feedback events , but on average feedback energy",
    "must be widely distributed in cluster radius .",
    "individual feedback events produce jets and cavities and associated shock waves that heat the cluster gas .",
    "the heated , high entropy gas expands , ultimately leading to a expansion of the entire cluster atmosphere in which the feedback energy is stored as potential energy .",
    "the final cluster gas entropy profile is increased by feedback energy and the gas fraction @xmath209 profile is reduced below the cosmic baryonic value @xmath25 .    for clusters having masses",
    "@xmath187 @xmath1 the total estimated feedback energy required to account for the observed depletion of cluster gas and the enhanced entropy profile is @xmath217 ergs , considerably in excess of cluster gas energy gained from supernovae or lost by radiation . although enormous , this energy exceeds the largest known energy released in single , most powerful feedback events , @xmath218 ergs .",
    "the most likely source of this energy is feedback from central black holes in cluster - centered elliptical galaxies . when averaged over a typical cluster lifetime , about @xmath219 gyrs , the mean mechanical luminosity , @xmath220 ergs s@xmath44 , is comparable to that of powerful quasars .",
    "such a large sustained luminosity may require energy creation not just from black hole accretion but also its spin energy .    immediately following a feedback energy event",
    ", we expect a significant local increase in gas temperature and thermal energy .",
    "but after a cluster sound - crossing time the cluster expands and the temperature returns to a rather flat profile near the virial temperature required to support the cluster gas . the sound - crossing time to @xmath49 in our two composite clusters ( 1,2 ) is @xmath221 yrs . in view of the insensitivity of the gas temperature profile to the feedback energy after time @xmath222 yrs ,",
    "changes in the cluster gas entropy @xmath223 arise almost entirely from changes in the gas density profile .",
    "after @xmath222 yrs , transient feedback events that increase the local gas temperature evolve by expansion into density reductions as thermal energy converts to potential energy , retaining approximately the same global @xmath76 .",
    "this explains the strong anti - correlation between excess entropy and reduced gas fraction in galaxy groups and clusters ( sun et al .",
    "inspired by pratt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we also demonstrate that the entropy profile observed in any relaxed cluster @xmath77 , when multiplied by a factor containing the gas fraction @xmath209 , recovers the universal adiabatic gas entropy profile expected in the absence of feedback , @xmath224^{2/3 } \\propto r^{1.2}$ ] , with small deviations related to recent feedback events .",
    "most of the feedback energy and entropy are delivered to very distant regions in cluster hot gas atmospheres , far beyond the cooling radius , where they have little or no effect on reducing the rate that gas cools near the central black hole , the presumed source of feedback energy . in the absence of feedback energy ,",
    "the observed cluster gas is expected to cool at a rate @xmath158 within the cooling radius @xmath145 , the cluster radius at which the cooling time equals the typical cluster age @xmath154 . for our clusters @xmath225 kpc .",
    "cooling flows near the central black hole can be greatly reduced or stopped if the mass of cluster gas that flows out across @xmath145 during the cluster lifetime @xmath154 , driven by feedback , is approximately equal to the inflowing mass due to radiation losses @xmath226 . for the clusters we consider it is gratifying that the cluster gas mass flow in both directions at @xmath145  out due to feedback and in due to radiation losses  are very nearly equal , indicating that approximately the right amount of feedback energy is delivered to gas at @xmath227 during @xmath154 to drastically reduce cooling near the black hole where little or no cold or cooling gas is observed .",
    "nevertheless , only a small fraction of the total feedback energy , less than 1 percent , is delivered and stored within @xmath145 .    finally , it is significant that the average mechanical feedback power @xmath228 erg s@xmath44 implied by observed cluster gas fractions @xmath229 , are very substantially higher than estimates of @xmath174 from observations of x - ray cavities , @xmath230 ergs ( rafferty et al .",
