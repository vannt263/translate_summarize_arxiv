    "the study of the superconducting properties of mesoscopic samples received recently a lot of attention due to the progress in nanofabrication technologies .",
    "a sample is mesoscopic if its size is comparable to the penetration depth @xmath2 and/or the coherence length @xmath3",
    ".    the properties of superconductors and therefore their applications are determined by the critical parameters , i.e. the critical fields @xmath4 , the critical current @xmath5 and the critical temperature @xmath6 . for application purposes one wants to improve these parameters . instead of searching for new bulk materials with new physical properties , one can also try to modify the properties of an existing material by nanostructuring the superconductor , i.e. ` quantum design ' .",
    "therefore , theoretical and experimental studies directed to improve the critical parameters of mesoscopic superconductors are important .    from the point of view of improving these parameters , mesoscopic thin disks immersed in an insulating medium and placed in a perpendicular magnetic field have attracted most attention . in disks with a small radius",
    "only giant vortex states exist which are axially symmetric superconducting  states @xcite .",
    "the different giant vortex states are characterized by their angular momentum , i.e. their vorticity @xmath7 . for disks with a sufficiently large radius ,",
    "multivortex states can exist which are the equivalent of the abrikosov vortex lattice in bulk type - ii superconductors @xmath8 and the vorticity corresponds to the number of separate vortices @xcite .",
    "for such disks , it is found that the critical magnetic field depends strongly on the size and on the ginzburg - landau parameter and less on the thickness of the disk .",
    "fink and presson @xcite studied the meissner state and the giant vortex state of a superconducting infinite cylinder immersed in an insulator or vacuum and placed in a magnetic field parallel to the cylinder axis using the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "they calculated how the critical field depends on the cylinder radius and on the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite  studied similar superconducting cylinders using the ginzburg - landau theory and calculated the critical fields as a function of the cylinder radius , the temperature and the ginzburg - landau parameter .",
    "varying the sample size and the ginzburg - landau parameter , one can decrease or increase the critical field , and thus the critical current , but it does not influence the critical temperature .",
    "how can one increase the critical temperature ?",
    "fink and joiner @xcite considered a semi - infinite superconducting half - space where the surface was treated by cold working in such a way that the superconductivity near the surface was enhanced , i.e. the slope of the superconducting order parameter increased near the sample surface .",
    "they found that such a surface treatment leads to higher critical temperatures , larger critical fields , and larger critical currents .",
    "another way to enhance superconductivity near the surface is by bringing the superconductor in contact with a well chosen superconducting or semiconducting layer @xcite .",
    "the added superconducting layer must have a higher transition temperature than the superconducting sample and in this case the surface enhancement of superconductivity is caused by the proximity effect .",
    "it is necessary that the semiconducting layer has a bandgap which overlaps the superconducting gap of the superconductor .",
    "montevecchi and indekeu @xcite performed a theoretical study of the effect of confinement on the superconducting / normal transition for systems with surface enhancement . using the linear ginzburg - landau theory they studied the critical temperature at zero field for a thin film , an infinite cylinder and a sphere .",
    "for all geometries they found that at @xmath10 the critical temperature increases with the enhancement of surface superconductivity . for thin films in a parallel field , they also calculated a @xmath11 phase diagram .",
    "they found that surface enhancement leads to an increase of the critical field @xmath12 and of the critical temperature .",
    "notice that their results do not depend on @xmath13 since they use the linear theory .",
    "yampolskii and peeters @xcite investigated theoretically the vortex structure of thin mesoscopic disks in a perpendicular magnetic field surrounded by a medium which enhances surface superconductivity .",
    "if the size of these thin disks is sufficiently large , they found giant vortex states as well as multivortex states appearing as metastable states and as ground states .",
    "the enhancement of the superconductivity near the surface leads to a stabilization of the multivortex states as ground states .",
    "they also calculated a @xmath11 phase diagram which showed that the critical temperature and the critical field were significantly increased by enhancing the surface superconductivity .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the effect of the enhancement of surface superconductivity on the critical field and the critical temperature for superconducting cylinders with radii equal to a few coherence lengths @xmath3 .",

    "this means that with increasing @xmath66 the magnetic field region over which the giant vortex state exists increases and the one of the multivortex state decreases .",
    "the reason is that increasing @xmath66 corresponds to an enhancement of superconductivity near the boundary .",
    "therefore , it is more difficult for the magnetic field to penetrate near the cylinder edge than in the center . since multivortices are situated more closely to the cylinder edge , it is obvious that multivortices become unstable at lower fields for increasing @xmath66 . or alternatively , the confinement effects become more important for increasing surface superconductivity .",
    "to illustrate this better , we show the cooper - pair density of the @xmath108 state for such a cylinder in figs .",

    "the three vortices correspond to the three white spots . for the usual boundary condition @xmath63",
    "the vortices are clearly separated . with increasing @xmath66",
    "the vortices are _ pushed _ to the center and at @xmath70 they already start to overlap . for @xmath196 and @xmath160",
    "the vortices are very close to each other .",
    "therefore , we plotted the logarithm of the cooper - pair density to show the positions of the vortices and to prove that it it still a multivortex state . thus , by the enhancement of the cooper - pair density near the boundary the vortices move to the center and for increasing @xmath66 they will recombine in the center creating a giant vortex state .",
    "in the present paper we investigated the effect of the enhancement of surface superconductivity on the critical field and the critical temperature for superconducting cylinders with radii comparable to the coherence length @xmath197 .",
    "we also studied the influence of a the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath9 .",
    "a distinction was made between cylinders with small radii where the confinement effects dominate and only giant vortex states exist , and cylinders with a larger radius where multivortices can nucleate for certain magnetic fields and vorticities .",
    "generally , increasing @xmath66 leads to a more negative free energy at @xmath10 and to a higher superconducting / normal transition field .",
    "we also studied the magnetic field distribution , the cooper - pair density and the current density for different values of the surface enhancement . for higher values of @xmath87 more magnetic field",
    "can be expelled from the cylinder and the giant vortex in the center is compressed more . therefore , higher currents are induced near the boundary and near the giant vortex . the cooper - pair density close to the boundary increases , and for small cylinders",
    "this also influences the cooper - pair density in the center .    from the @xmath11 phase diagrams we found that the critical temperature depends on @xmath66 , while it is independent of @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . with increasing @xmath66 the critical temperature increases for fixed magnetic field and the critical magnetic field increases for fixed temperature .",
    "we also obtained @xmath153 phase diagrams . in type - i cylinders",
    "the surface enhancement has drastic consequences . even at low @xmath9",
    "the surface enhancement leads to transitions between different @xmath7-state and thus to type - ii behavior .",
    "moreover , as a function of the magnetic field the superconducting ground state transits from the meissner state to a vortex state with @xmath1 over a range of @xmath66 values .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that increasing @xmath66 for type - i superconductors seems to have a similar effect as increasing @xmath0 for fixed @xmath66 for certain properties of the superconducting cylinder . in type - ii cylinders we found that the magnetic field range over which the ground state has a particular vorticity @xmath7 is almost the same for all @xmath1 .",
    "this magnetic field range decreases with increasing cylinder radius .",
    "if the cylinder radius is sufficiently large multivortex states can nucleate and we studied the influence of the surface enhancement on the nucleation of these states .",
