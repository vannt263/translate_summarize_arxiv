    "the high cross section for heavy flavour production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) offers a fantastic opportunity to study the known heavy flavour hadrons and to search for the many `` missing '' states predicted in the quark model .",
    "in particular , hadrons containing a @xmath0 quark are expected to be copiously produced at the lhc .",
    "further to this , many heavy hadron states ( bottom baryons in particular ) are only accessible at hadron colliders , and with the end of data taking at the tevatron , the lhc is fast becoming the one of the best facilities to study heavy hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the lhc has already delivered its first two discoveries of new @xmath0 hadrons within the first three years of running .",
    "the atlas collaboration has observed a new state in radiative transitions to @xmath3 and @xmath4 and interprets this as the first observation of the @xmath5 states  @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration observes a new @xmath0 baryon decaying to @xmath6 ( plus charge conjugates ) , interpreted as a neutral @xmath8 baryon  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 states represent the @xmath10 ( parallel quark spins ) @xmath11-wave states of the bottomonium ( @xmath12 ) system .",
    "the @xmath9 comprise a triplet of states , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with quantum numbers @xmath16 .",
    "the three states are characterised by a small hyperfine mass splitting of @xmath17 .",
    "the branching fractions for the radiative decays @xmath18 are large , @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 triplets ( with spin - weighted masses of around @xmath22 and @xmath23 gev respectively ) have been studied in detail at @xmath24 colliders , providing precise measurements of the hyperfine mass structure and radiative branching fractions @xcite .",
    "additionally , a third triplet of states , the @xmath5 , is expected below the open beauty threshold at a mass around @xmath25  @xcite .    given the complex hadronic environment of the lhc",
    ", the radiative decays @xmath18 with @xmath26 represent a very clean experimental channel to study the @xmath9 states , where the presence of two muons offers a clear signature to trigger upon .",
    "the aim of the atlas analysis is to reconstruct the radiative decays @xmath27 and @xmath28 with two independent analyses that reconstruct the photon with either a direct calorimetric measurement or through the reconstruction of @xmath24 conversions in the atlas tracker .",
    "the two photon reconstruction methods have their own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "in particular , converted photons offer better invariant mass resolution compared to photons reconstructed by the calorimeter but at the expense of a much lower reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the atlas collaboration has recently reported the observation of a new structure decaying to @xmath29 and @xmath30 consistent with the @xmath5 system  @xcite .",
    "the following sections summarise the atlas analysis and results , a detailed description of the atlas detector can be found in @xcite .",
    "the atlas analysis uses a data sample , recorded by the atlas experiment during the 2011 lhc proton - proton collision run at a centre of mass energy @xmath2 , representing an integrated luminosity of @xmath32 .",
    "the data sample was collected by a set of triggers designed to select events containing di - muon candidates or single high transverse momentum muons .",

    "candidate photon conversions are reconstructed from two oppositely charged tracks reconstructed in the atlas inner detector ( i d ) that intersect at a common vertex .",
    "the two tracks are fitted to a common conversion vertex where the fit is required to converge with a @xmath40 probability greater than 0.01 .",
    "each electron track is required to have transverse momentum @xmath41 and pseudorapidity @xmath34 and to be reconstructed from at least 4 hits in the silicon layers of the i d .",

    "unconverted photon candidates are required to have a transverse energy greater than @xmath44 and pseudorapidity @xmath45 .",
    "photon candidates are also required to satisfy the `` loose '' photon identification selection described in @xcite to reject backgrounds from @xmath46 decays and narrow jets .",
    "unconverted photons reconstructed within the transition region ( @xmath47 ) between the barrel and end cap calorimeters are not selected . to improve the momentum resolution of unconverted photons , the polar angle of the unconverted photon",
    "is corrected to point back to the di - muon vertex , exploiting the longitudinal segmentation of the atlas electromagnetic calorimeter .",

    "the higher transverse momentum threshold for the reconstruction of unconverted photons prohibits the reconstruction of soft photons from @xmath62 decays .",
    "unbinned maximum likelihood fits are performed to the @xmath53 distributions for both the converted and unconverted @xmath9 candidates to measure the mass of the new structure under its interpretation as the @xmath5 states , both fits are described in detail in  @xcite .    the @xmath63 distribution for unconverted photon candidates is described by three gaussian probability density functions ( pdfs ) , each with independent mean value , width and normalisation parameters .",

    "the mass measurements using both converted and unconverted photons are compatible with each other and with the theoretical expectations for the @xmath5 system . the mass measurement from the converted photon analysis with the lower statistical and systematic uncertainty",

    "the significance of the @xmath5 signal is assessed from the logarithmic likelihood ratio @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 represent likelihood values calculated from fits with and without a @xmath5 signal included respectively .",
    "the significance is re - assessed for each set of systematic variations and is consistently found to be in excess of @xmath79 standard deviations for both the unconverted and converted photon analyses independently .",
    "the observation of a new structure in the @xmath29 spectrum was recently confirmed by the @xmath80 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "@xmath80 measure the mass of the structure to be @xmath81 , consistent with the atlas measurement .",

    "further measurements by atlas and the other lhc experiments will hopefully shed more light on this new state in the near future .",
    "until recently , the @xmath82 states represented the only experimentally observed baryons to contain one strange and one bottom valence quark within the quark model of baryons . the first direct observation of the @xmath82 , of which there exists both neutral @xmath83 and negatively charged @xmath84 varieties , came from the tevatron experiments  @xcite , although indirect evidence for the @xmath85 was seen at lep  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the the @xmath86 @xmath82 ground states , the quark model predicts the @xmath86 @xmath87 , @xmath7 @xmath8 and two further states with @xmath88 orbital angular momentum between the @xmath0 quark and the light di - quark system  @xcite . the strong decay @xmath89 is expected to be kinematically forbidden due to an expected @xmath90 mass difference below the pion mass .",

    "the cms analysis represents a search for @xmath93 baryons in @xmath6 ( plus charge conjugate ) decays with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( plus charge conjugates ) . for brevity",

    "the following sections summarise the cms analysis and results presented in @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the cms detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the cms analysis is based on a sample of @xmath1 collision data representing an integrated luminosity of @xmath98 collected during the 2011 lhc run at a centre of mass energy @xmath99 .",
    "the data used by the cms analysis are collected by specialised triggers designed to record events containing two oppositely charged muons that are compatible with having been produced in the decay of a @xmath100 .",
    "separate triggers are used to select events containing @xmath95 candidates that are promptly produced and those that are displaced from the primary vertex .",
    "the foundation of the analysis is the reconstruction of a pure sample of @xmath94 decays ( with @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "candidate @xmath100 are formed from pairs of oppositely charged muons reconstructed from tracks in the silicon tracker , matched to independent tracks in the muon detectors .",
    "the two muons are required to pass the trigger selection and the di - muon candidate must have an invariant mass within @xmath101 of the world average @xmath100 mass  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath102 decays begins with the identification of candidate @xmath103 decays from pairs of oppositely charged tracks .",
    "the track with the higher momentum is taken to be the proton .",
    "the two tracks are required to have been reconstructed from at least 6 six hits in the silicon tracker and to have a track fit @xmath104 .",
    "the two tracks are fitted to a common decay vertex and the fit result is required to satisfy @xmath105 .",
    "the decay vertex is required to be displaced from the beam line by more than ten times the uncertainty on the displacement .",
    "to remove possible contamination from @xmath106 decays , the invariant mass of the candidate ( with both tracks assigned the pion mass ) is rejected if it lies within @xmath107 of the @xmath106 mass .",
    "@xmath102 candidates are then reconstructed through the combination of a candidate @xmath108 with a track ( denoted @xmath109 ) with the same charge as the pion from the @xmath103 candidate ( denoted @xmath110 ) .",
    "the three tracks are then subjected to a kinematic vertex fit where the invariant mass of the two tracks from the @xmath108 candidate are constrained to the world average @xmath108 mass . to reject backgrounds from mis - reconstructed @xmath111 decays , the @xmath102 candidate is rejected if its invariant mass , with the @xmath109 track given the charged kaon mass , lies within @xmath107 of the @xmath112 mass .",
    "finally , @xmath85 candidates are formed by combining candidate @xmath102 and @xmath100 decays in a kinematic vertex fit where the masses of the @xmath102and @xmath100 candidates are constrained to the world average values .    to select a high yield sample of @xmath85 candidates with high purity ,",
    "the @xmath85 selection ( characterised by the values of thirty selection variables ) is optimised by an iterative algorithm that maximises both the signal yield and significance .",
    "the thirty optimised variables include the transverse momentum threshold of the @xmath100 , @xmath113 , @xmath110 , @xmath109 , @xmath102 , @xmath85 and muon candidates .",
    "the values of the latter two thresholds ( @xmath85 and both muons ) can take different values depending on whether the candidates were reconstructed in the barrel or endcap regions on the detector .",
    "the requirements on the difference between the reconstructed invariant masses and the world average values for the @xmath108 , @xmath102 and @xmath100 candidates are also optimised .",
    "other important optimised variables include the impact parameter significance of the @xmath113 , @xmath110 and @xmath109 tracks and transverse decay length ( and its significance ) of the @xmath108 , @xmath102 and @xmath85 decay vertices .",

    "the @xmath114 distribution is fit with a gaussian pdf to describe the signal and a second order polynomial to describe the background .",
    "the fit results in a yield of @xmath116 @xmath85 candidates and a fitted @xmath85 mass of @xmath117 , a value which agrees well with the current world average  @xcite .",
    "@xmath85 candidates with a mass within @xmath118 of the fitted @xmath85 mass are associated with a track , given the pion mass , with a charge opposite to that of the @xmath109 .",
    "the tracks are required to be compatible with having been produced at the primary vertex and to have a transverse momentum greater than @xmath119 .",
    "the events in the cms data sample contain on average eight primary vertices .",

    "a potential @xmath93 signal is expected to appear as a peak in the @xmath120 distribution . in order to search for such peaks , the background contribution to the @xmath121 distribution",

    "the uncorrelated set of values is used to calculate a value for @xmath121 , this is repeated @xmath124 times to give a @xmath121 distribution which is expected to predict the shape of the combinatorial background .",
    "this distribution is then fitted with the function @xmath125 where the @xmath126 are all free parameters .",

    "an unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed to the @xmath121 value distribution in figure  [ xibstar ] where the excess is modelled by a breit - wigner distribution convolved with a gaussian resolution function ( with a width fixed to @xmath128 , a value derived from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ) .",
    "the background model discussed earlier is used to describe the combinatorial background where the @xmath126 parameters are free to vary within their total uncertainties .",
    "the fitted mean value of the signal is @xmath129 with a breit - wigner width of @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "the significance of the signal is assessed though the calculation of @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the likelihood value of the nominal ( signal and background ) fit and @xmath133 is the likelihood value for a fit performed with a background only model .",
    "the statistical significance calculated in the way is @xmath134 standard deviations .",
    "the significance is also evaluated though a number of other approaches ( including a treatment of the `` look elsewhere effect '' ) , all of which result in a significance in excess of @xmath135 standard deviations .",
    "various cross checks are performed using mc simulation samples of @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 decays .",
    "the analysis procedure performed on these samples does not exhibit any excess in the @xmath121 distribution that might arise from the mis - reconstruction of known @xmath0 hadrons .    the systematic uncertainty on the measured @xmath121 value of the signal receives contributions from the observation of a small upwards shift in the @xmath121 distribution in mc simulation and uncertainties associated with the background model .",
