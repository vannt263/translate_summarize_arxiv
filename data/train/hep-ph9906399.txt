    "the present knowledge on the gluon density in the proton basically comes from deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure function data ( i.e. from inclusive dis cross sections ) .",
    "these are , however , only indirectly sensitive to the gluon density , which enters the cross section formulae only via the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections in the boson - gluon fusion process .",
    "a process that is _ directly _ sensitive to the gluon density in the proton is the production of jets at ( moderately ) high transverse energies ( @xmath3 ) in the breit frame . at leading order ,",
    "high @xmath3 jet cross sections are described by qcd - compton and by boson - gluon fusion processes , the latter being dominant over large regions of phase space .",
    "a qcd analysis of jet cross sections may therefore lead to a direct determination of the gluon density , independent of assumptions needed in the indirect determinations from structure function data .",
    "the dijet and the inclusive jet cross sections presented here have been measured with the h1 detector at hera , based on data taken in the years 1994 - 97 corresponding to an integrated luminosity @xmath4 .",
    "the kinematic range extends from moderate to large momentum transfers @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "jets are defined by the inclusive @xmath7 algorithm @xcite which is applied to the final state particles in the breit frame . only jets in the central region of the detector acceptance with pseudorapidities @xmath8 and transverse jet energies @xmath9 are considered .",
    "the inclusive jet cross section @xmath10 has been measured for @xmath11 . for the dijet cross section events with two or more jets",
    "have been selected where the two jets with the highest @xmath3 fulfill @xmath12 .",
    "double differential distributions have been obtained for a large set of variables @xcite . here",
    "we show the dependence of the inclusive jet cross section on both hardness scales @xmath3 , @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : incljetet ] ) , and the dependence of the dijet cross section on the jet pseudorapidity @xmath14 and the reconstructed fractional parton momentum @xmath15 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : dijetetap],[fig : dijetxi ] ) .",
    "the basic observations are : towards larger @xmath13 a harder @xmath3 spectrum is seen ; large jet pseudorapidities @xmath14 are suppressed at higher @xmath3 ; the jet cross sections are sensitive to fractional parton momenta @xmath16 .",
    "the perturbative calculations give a very good description of these and other distributions @xcite , except at small values of @xmath17 where nlo corrections are very large ( k - factors are between 1.6 and 2 ) and sizeable contributions from higher orders are expected .",
    "-8 mm    -8 mm    -8 mm",
    "we have seen that the jet data are nicely described by perturbative calculations at nlo when parton densities and @xmath18 values are taken from global fits .",
    "we therefore conclude that perturbative qcd at next - to - leading order @xmath19 is able to describe jet production processes in dis , at least in the kinematic region under investigation : at fairly large transverse jet energies @xmath3 in the breit frame and momentum transfers @xmath13 not too small .",
    "the influence of non - perturbative contributions has been investigated @xcite and is found to be small ( below 7% for the dijet cross sections ) with negligible model dependence .",
    "it is now straightforward to make a qcd analysis of these data for a determination of the free parameters of the theory : @xmath19 , the gluon density and the quark densities in the proton .",
    "the present data are , however , not able to constrain these simultaneously .",
    "we therefore decided to take the value of @xmath18 ( as e.g.   measured by the lep experiments independently of the proton structure ) as external input , and perform a simultaneous fit of the gluon and quark densities in the proton .",
    "for this purpose we include h1 data on the inclusive dis cross section @xcite in the qcd analysis at @xmath13 values which are of the order of the transverse jet energies @xmath20 in the dijet cross sections .    in this kinematic region ( @xmath21 )",
    "the inclusive dis cross sections give very strong constraints on the quark densities while they depend on the gluon density only weakly . in the combined fit of both datasets",
    "the inclusive dis cross sections therefore determine the quarks while the dijet cross sections determine the gluon density .",
    "the dijet data used in the fit are restricted to @xmath22 where nlo corrections and hadronization corrections are small .",
    "the fit has been performed to the double differential cross sections @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 which are most sensitive to the @xmath2-dependence of the parton distributions .",
    "the gluon and the quark densities have been fitted at a factorization scale @xmath1 which is of the size of the hard scales for both the dijet ( @xmath26 ) and the inclusive dis cross sections ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "more details on the fitting procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the resulting gluon density is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon ] at the scale @xmath1 in the range @xmath28 .",
    "the error band includes experimental and theoretical uncertainties as well as the uncertainty of @xmath18 . within these uncertainties",
    "this direct determination is consistent to the results from global fits and to indirect determinations from hera structure function data and extends their range of sensitivity to larger @xmath2-values .",
