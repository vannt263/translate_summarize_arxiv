    "instabilities of thin liquid films between a solid substrate and a gas atmosphere have attracted much scientific interest .",
    "the main focus lies thereby on front instabilities of moving contact lines @xcite or on instabilities of the free liquid - gas interface of a flat film @xcite .",
    "a recent review can be found in ref .. to analyze such instabilities a long - wave or lubrication approximation @xcite is often used as a very powerful tool especially for low reynolds number film flows . at present",
    "the basic behavior of one - layer films in the physically different thickness ranges is well understood .",
    "several instability mechanisms exist that by means of different driving forces may destabilize an initially flat film .",
    "they are described , analysed and modelled in a large number of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works . for film thicknesses",
    "@xmath0 less than about @xmath1 nm , effective molecular interactions between the film surface and the substrate dominate all the other forces , like thermo- and soluto - capillarity or gravity , and thus determine the film stability . for heated films of thicknesses above @xmath1 nm ,",
    "eventually thermocapillary forces become the most important influence leading to an instability caused by large - scale marangoni convection @xcite .",
    "it is dominant up to an upper limit of the film thickness determined by the competition between large - scale and small - scale convection modes @xcite . for even thicker films with thicknesses above @xmath2 m also the gravity force becomes important .",
    "depending on its direction it may stabilize the large - scale marangoni instability or destabilize the film further ( rayleigh - taylor instability ) @xcite .",
    "the lubrication approximation is valid up to a limiting film thickness obtained by the requirement that the wave length of the dominant instability mode @xmath3 is much larger than the film thickness @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath4 . for the rayleigh - taylor instability",
    "@xmath3 depends on the interfacial tension , the density of the liquid and the gravitational acceleration but not on the film thickness @xcite .",
    "it is of the order of @xmath5 to @xmath6 m implying an upper limit for the film thickness of @xmath7 to @xmath8 m .",
    "the stability and evolution of liquid films of thicknesses below @xmath1 nm is determined by effectiv molecular interactions between substrate and film arising , for instance , from van der waals , electrostatic or entropic interactions @xcite .",
    "such films are lineary unstable if the energy of the intermolecular interaction is a convex function of the film thickness . for film thicknesses above @xmath9",
    "nm the long - range van der waals forces dominate .",
    "they can be of different nature depending on the molecular properties of the involved media .",
    "one distinguishes interactions between two randomly orienting dipoles ( orientation interaction ) , between a randomly orienting dipole and an induced dipole ( induction interaction ) , and between a fluctuating dipole and an induced dipole ( dispersion interaction ) . between two parallel interfaces at a distance @xmath0 , all these forces decay as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hamaker constant @xcite .",
    "an unstable situation corresponds to a positive hamaker constant .",
    "note , however that different schools use different sign conventions .",
    "the dominant wave length of the instability @xmath3 increases monotonically with @xmath0 as @xmath12 ( see ref . ) .",
    "the stability of a film may change dramatically for a substrate coated with a layer of different dielectric properties as , for instance , a silicon substrate ( si ) coated with an silicon oxide layer ( sio ) @xcite .",
    "there , for an oxide layer of about 2 nm only ultrathin polystyrene ( ps ) films below 4 nm thickness are linearly unstable .",
    "increasing the film thickness in the linearly unstable range , the wave length @xmath13 increases rapidly and diverges at the critical thickness @xmath14 . for @xmath15",
    "the film is linearly stable , but may rupture due to finite disturbances .",
    "imagine one replaces the ( solid ) coating layer by a liquid layer transforming the system in a two - layer liquid film .",
    "some of the results obtained for a solid coating can be directly transferred to the new situation .",
    "the stability of the ( now ) upper layer still depends on the ( now liquid ) coating layer . however , additionally the liquid coating layer itself may be unstable making a re - evaluation of the stability necessary . this thought experiment leads quite naturally to the extension of the well studied one - layer systems to two - layer systems that are the subject of the present work . in general , there exist two possible two - layer geometries . on the one hand",
    "the two liquid layers can be situated between two solid plates leaving only the interface between the two liquids free to move . in consequence",
    "such a system can be described by a single evolution equation @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the two layers can be situated between a solid substrate and a gas atmosphere . then both , the liquid - liquid and the liquid - gas interface are free to move and their evolution has to be described by coupled evolution equations .",
    "models were derived , for instance , assuming a lower liquid layer that is much thicker than the upper layer @xcite , and for two - layer systems with surfactants ( and non - newtonian behaviour ) @xcite or including evaporation @xcite .",
    "a two - layer system under the solely influence of molecular interactions is studied in ref .. in ref .",
    "a similar system is studied , however , the evolution equations are given in terms of variations of an energy functional .",
    "the experimental interest in two - layer liquid films is up to now mainly focused on the dewetting of a liquid layer from a very thick layer , i.e.  a liquid bulk substrate @xcite . in contrast ref .",
    "studies the dewetting of a polystyrene ( ps ) layer of @xmath16 to @xmath17 nm thickness from a @xmath18 nm thick polyamide ( pa ) layer .",
    "the substrate is a silicon ( si ) wafer covered with a layer of native oxide . at high temperature ( @xmath19c ) and small thicknesses ( @xmath20 nm ) the ps layer is unstable and dewets exhibiting typical spinodal patterns . at low temperature ( @xmath21c )",
    "the pa layer is solid resulting in a stable ps layer , independent of its thickness",
    "studies relatively thick layers ( @xmath1 nm to @xmath22 m thickness ) of poly(dimethylsiloxane ) ( pdms ) layers on a liquid substrate of fluorinated pdms .",
    "they show that the pdms films are metastable and may dewet by nucleation of holes .",
    "the velocity of the growth of holes depends on the viscosity and thickness of the substrate . in another system ( ps layer on poly(methylmethacrylate )",
    "( pmma ) layer , both with thicknesses of about @xmath1 nm ) the dewetting velocity was found to exhibit a minimum as a function of the viscosity of the lower layer @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for a polycarbonate ( pc ) layer on a poly(styrene-@xmath23-acrylonitrile ) ( san ) layer ref .",
    "reports a non - trivial dependence of the dewetting velocity on both layer thicknesses .",
    "recently we presented coupled evolution equations for two - layer liquid films taking into account long - range van der waals interactions only @xcite .",
    "this allows to study pathways towards rupture but can not describe the long - time evolution of such films as , for instance , necessary for the description of the above mentioned experiments . in the present paper we present the derivation of the system of evolution equations for",
    "a general interaction energy and a non - isothermal situation and then study the short- and long - time evolution of two - layer liquid films incorporating long - range and short - range interactions .",
    "thereby the main focus lies on ultrathin layers with respective thicknesses below @xmath1 nm for which the effective molecular interactions between the four media are the dominant influence .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the problem is formulated in section  [ deriv ] followed by the derivation of the relevant long wave evolution equations for a general non - isothermal case allowing also for slip at the substrate .",
    "focusing on the isothermal case without slip these equations are analyzed and integrated numerically in the subsequent sections .",

    "the slip length is denoted by @xmath42 . at the liquid - liquid interface @xmath43",
    "we use the continuity of the velocity field , the kinematic condition and the continuity of the tangential component of the liquid stress tensor @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",

    "note , that the mobility matrix @xmath75 is symmetric and all mobilities @xmath76 and @xmath77 are positive . dropping the terms representing the effective molecular interactions , eqs.([evol_phys ] ) represent the fully nonlinear equivalent for the weakly nonlinear equations derived in ref .. assuming that the interfacial tensions are influenced by thermocapillarity only , one can express the derivatives @xmath78 and @xmath79 in terms of gradients of local thicknesses @xmath80 .",
    "this is done in the appendix .    for isothermal ultrathin liquid films one has @xmath81",

    "however , if the model only takes into account a destabilizing long - range interaction the time evolution definitively leads to rupture of the upper or lower layer @xcite making it impossible to study the long - time coarsening behaviour . to be able to study the long - time evolution one has to include stabilizing short - range interactions @xcite into the model .",
    "although these are normally not included for films of thicknesses above @xmath9 nm because they do not change the stability of flat films , also for such films they become important in the non - linear stage of evolution when the local thicknesses become comparable to their interaction length .",

    "going back to the isothermal case , inspection of the generalized eigenvalue problem shows that the stability threshold is completely determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath145 .",
    "since the surface tension terms are always positive , the onset of the instability is always found for @xmath156 , i.e.  the system is linearly stable , independently of the wavelength of the disturbance , for @xmath157 an instability sets in if at least one of the conditions ( [ stab ] ) is violated .",
    "then the flat two - layer film is unstable to disturbances with @xmath136 larger zero and smaller than a cutoff wavenumber @xmath158 determined by the condition @xmath159 .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows a schematic stability diagram in the plane @xmath160 .",
    "the stability threshold @xmath161 is a hyperbola , represented by the solid line .",
    "the unstable region below and left of that line is divided by a second hyperbola into a two - mode and a one - mode region . in the two - mode region both growth rates given by eq.([gr_rate ] ) are positive for @xmath136 smaller then the respective cut - off @xmath162 . in the one - mode region",

    "if at @xmath156 the system is in the one - mode region the line @xmath165 is crossed only once ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "as detailed above the stabilizing short - range interaction only becomes important if at least one layer thickness is locally comparable to the interaction length @xmath112 , i.e.  if a layer becomes thinner than about @xmath9 nm .",
    "therefore , to study the linear stability of thicker layers one can neglect the short - range terms in eq.([enrg_scl ] ) . in this case ,",
    "eq.([stab ] ) is used to study the role of the hamaker constants eq.([ham ] ) in the linear evolution of the system .",

    "@xmath167 is a function of the ratio @xmath0 of the layer thicknesses only . using table  [ ham_table ]",
    "one can show that for positive @xmath168 the equation @xmath169 can only have the solution @xmath170 , i.e.  @xmath171 .",
    "this means that only for vanishing upper layer the system can be on the stability threshold . in consequence",
    "the stability threshold can @xmath172 be crossed by solely changing the ratio of layer thicknesses .",

    "( 2 ) the one - layer liquid film is unstable for @xmath179 .",
    "it can also be destabilized by changing the layer thicknesses , as was shown in ref . for a rigid ps layer on top of a liquid pdms layer on a si substrate .    comparing the stability thresholds for the two effective one - layer systems to the stability diagram in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "shows that the stability threshold of the two - layer system lies in the region where both effective one - layer systems are stable .",
    "this indicates that a two - layer system is always less stable than corresponding effective one - layer systems .",
    "the stability threshold can be studied in rather general terms as was done above because its main features do not depend on surface tensions or viscosities . however",
    ", this is not the case for the characteristics of the instability like mode type , growth rates or dominant wave length . to discuss these we focus in the following on selected two - layer films studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "we consider various combinations of layers of polystyrene ( ps ) , poly(methylmethacrylate ) ( pmma ) and poly(dimethylsiloxane ) ( pdms ) on a silicon ( si ) or on a silicon - oxide ( sio ) substrate .",
    "the hamaker constants for different combinations are calculated using eq.([ham ] ) and given in table  [ ham ] .",
    "the linear instability of a two - layer film has two different modes .",
    "it can be of zigzag or varicose type .",
    "for the former the deflections of the two interfaces are in phase whereas for the latter they are in anti - phase . for special parameter values",
    "one can also find a mixed type , where modes are present because they have equal fastest growth rates @xcite .",
    "the model studied in ref . assumes a thick lower layer thereby neglecting the interaction between the substrate and the liquid - liquid and the liquid - gas interface . in this case",
    "only the varicose mode can be unstable . in the general case , however ,",
    "also the zigzag mode can become unstable .",
    "both modes are normally asymmetric , i.e.  the deflection amplitudes of the two interfaces differ .",

    "the value @xmath182 represents the symmetric case , whereas @xmath183 corresponds to maximal asymetry , i.e.  one of the interfaces is flat .",
    "the asymmetry increases with the ratio of the surface tensions @xmath184 .",
    "note , that the dispersion relation and the type of the dominant mode depend on @xmath184 and @xmath185 , whereas the stability diagram fig.[fig2 ] _ does not_.    the two mode types are plotted in fig.[fig3 ] for a si / pmma / ps / air system for a fixed value of @xmath0 and different ratios of viscosities @xmath185 .",

    "] ) does not allow to give an analytic expression for the wave number @xmath189 and the characteristic growth time @xmath190 of the fastest growing mode .",
    "nevertheless , one can derive asymptotic expressions for @xmath189 and @xmath191 in the two important limiting cases of ( 1 ) small thickness of the upper layer @xmath192 and ( 2 ) small thickness of the lower layer @xmath193 .",

    "the subcritical branch is unstable with energies higher than the energy of the flat film ( fig.[fig12](b ) ) .",
    "the second branch starting at the fold @xmath260 consists of solutions whose energy decreases monotonically with increasing period .",

    "when the period becomes larger than @xmath262 , the solution changes to zigzag type ( fig.[fig12](d ) ) as shown in fig.[fig13](b ) .",

    "here we have restricted our attention to a parameter set corresponding to region i of fig.[fig5 ] , i.e.  corresponding to the stability diagram shown in fig.[fig4](a ) .",
    "the existence of a stable branch of stationary solutions which continues towards infinite period implies that the rupture of the two layers is completely avoided by the short - range repulsion .",
    "however , this may not be the case for parameter ranges belonging to the other types of stability diagrams .",
    "a detailed analysis of the stationary solutions for all types will be done elsewhere .",
    "the stability of the numerical code , used to solve the evolution equations eqs.([evol_phys ] ) , requires a very small time step @xmath263 . as a result",
    "it takes very long even to reach the final stationary solution in a system of size @xmath264 using @xmath265 grid points .",
    "it is not feasible at the moment to study many coarsening steps in this way .",
    "however , one can rely on continuation techniques that use an adaptive spatial grid along the continuation path @xcite to obtain stationary solutions of arbitrarily large periods that correspond to solutions that would be obtained in a time evolution at very late times .",
    "we show in fig.[fig14 ] possible large - period stationary solutions for different physical systems that are investigated experimentally .",
    "one finds qualitatively different morphologies like a drop of the lower liquid looking through a nearly flat film of the upper layer for a si / pmma / ps / air system .",
    "note however that also the upper layer is continuous ( due to the stabilizing short - range interaction ) , i.e.  also the drop is covered by a very thin layer of the upper liquid .",
    "this is more pronounced for a sio / ps / pdms / air system .",
    "in contrast , for a sio / pmma / ps / air system one finds a drop of the upper liquid swimming on the lower liquid that however is attracted towards the base of the drop .",
    "these equilibrium solutions are equivalents of drop configurations studied in ref . for macroscopic ( but smaller than the capilary length ) drops .",
    "however , here the mesoscopic contact angles are not given explicitely but result from the underlying effective molecular interactions , i.e.  the short- and long - range forces used .",
    "we have derived coupled non - linear evolution equations for the profiles of the liquid - liquid and liquid - gas interfaces of a thin two - layer liquid film heated from below allowing for slip at the substrate .",
    "we have shown that in the isothermal case the evolution equations can be written in terms of variations of an appropriate lyapunov functional @xmath82 which monotonically decreases in time .",
    "the stability conditions for flat layers have been given in terms of @xmath82 .",
    "we have shown that a two - layer film is less stable than related effective one - layer films introduced in section  [ lr_int ] .",
    "even if both effective one - layer films are stable the two - layer film may be unstable if the determinant of the energy matrix @xmath266 is negative .",
    "we have shown that if the hamaker constants are given by the usual expression ( eq.([ham ] ) ) , i.e.  they are coupled through the refractive indices , and no other forces are present , the stability of the flat films with thicknesses of ( @xmath267 nm ) can not be changed by solely changing the layer thicknesses . incorporating a stabilizing short - range interaction the stability",
    "can be changed in this way .",
    "we have classified the resulting possible types of stability diagrams in the space of the layer thicknesses and given a phase diagram in terms of the short - range parts of the spreading coefficients for the occurence of the different types of stability diagrams .",
    "in general , the linear stability analysis of the flat film has shown that both , varicose or zigzag mode , may be unstable depending on the ratios of the layer thicknesses , viscosities and surface tensions ( see also ref . ) .",
    "this seems to be in contrast to ref .. however , the difference arises because there it is assumed that the lower layer is thick compared to the upper layer neglecting thereby all interactions with the substrate",
    ". then the zigzag mode is always stable .",
    "the introduction of the stabilizing short - range interaction allows to study the long - time evolution and stationary layer profiles .",
    "possible stationary states have then been determined as extrema of the lyapunov functional @xmath82 .",
    "the resulting bifurcation diagrams show a rich branch structure that depends strongly on parameter values .",
    "we have focused on one type of stability diagram where a stable branch going towards infinite period always exists .",
    "this implies the existence of a non - ruptured stationary state in the long - time limit also in the time evolution .",
    "we have found that the mode type of a profile may change during the evolution of an instability on three ways .",
    "first , the profile type changes in the course of the short - time evolution .",
    "this is connected to different mode types found for the dominant linear mode and the stationary solution of equal period on the solution branch approached first in the time evolution .",
    "it seems that this behaviour is more probable for a subcritical primary bifurcation . in the case",
    "studied here this change is from zigzag to varicose . in the nonlinear regime",
    "the profile can change its type by ( i ) jumping from one to another stable branch and by ( ii ) coarsening along a single stable branch .",
    "combinations of the different ways may also be possible .",
    "we have found that for the parameters considered here both nonlinear transitions go from varicose towards zigzag type . in case ( i )",
    "the transition occurs without change of the period , but with a dramatic increase in amplitude of the profile . in the case ( ii )",
    "the transition occurs continuously without amplitude jump because mediated by coarsening a small - period varicose mode turns into a large - period zigzag one .    in all examples considered here ( except the sio / pmma / ps / air system with @xmath268 , @xmath269 )",
    "we have found a zigzag - type solution at large periods .",
    "for the future it would be very interesting to further analyze the stationary solutions for a broader range of experimentally interesting systems like the ones studied in refs .. this should clarify under which conditions the long - time ( or large - period ) solutions are energetically preferable and determine how late the transition may occur .",
    "a systematic analysis of all types of stability diagrams would also discuss metastability and absolute stability of the flat two - layer films .",
    "furthermore , we are very optimistic that the evolution equations presented here will serve to study the questions of hole growth and possible front instabilities in the dewetting of a liquid layer on a liquid substrate of finite thickness@xcite .      to further specify the thermocapillar part of eqs.[evol_phys ] we rewrite the derivatives @xmath78 and @xmath270 in terms of the gradients of the local thicknesses @xmath271 . in the long - wave approximation",
