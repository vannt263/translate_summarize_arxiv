    "the general belief that quantum chromodynamics , qcd , is @xmath3 correct theory of strong interactions being the only one able to describe this physical regime .",
    "however , reliable predictions can actually be extracted for a very restricted class of physical quantities , i.e. , in general qcd can only handle hard processes ( perturbative processes ) .",
    "soft processes ( high - energy elastic hadron scattering , for example ) are usually described by models and some of them are `` qcd inspired '' @xcite . however , there are models reaching remarkable results as , for example , cheng and wu model @xcite ( pre - qcd ) that asymptotically predicts the total cross section , @xmath4 , will increase as @xmath5 where @xmath5 is a typical interaction radius which grows logarithmically with energy , @xmath6 .",
    "actually , explain high - energies @xmath0 and @xmath1 elastic scattering is a very difficult task since it is necessary to understand the formally theoretical results obtained within axiomatic quantum field theory , as well as the experimental available data from hadron - hadron collision experiments realized over decades . in this way",
    ", models of elastic scattering must obey theorems and bounds as the froissart - martin bound , pumplin bound , pomeranchuk theorem , and others since these theoretical results are model - independent . on the other hand ,",
    "these formal results do not allow us to write a functional form for @xmath0 and @xmath1 elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "consequently , the experimental data play a central role in this kind of analysis . nowadays , experimental data about @xmath0 and @xmath1 elastic scattering allows a novel understanding of scattering reactions because its data set are the most complete and that reaches the highest energies at colliders .",
    "the total cross section is an example of the importance of experimental data analysis since before the advent of isr collider , it was assumed that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections were approaching a common constant value of about 40 mb , at @xmath7 . when the isr was turned on",
    ", some results showed that @xmath0 cross section was rising with energy , more precisely , had a rise that could be fitted with a @xmath8 leading term .    in @xcite a phenomenological approach to explain high energies @xmath0 and @xmath1 total cross sections , differential cross sections and @xmath9 parameter is presented . this parameterization is based on bounds and theorems of the axiomatic quantum field theory and on @xmath0 and @xmath1 experimental available data above @xmath10 gev for the total cross sections , differential cross sections , and @xmath9 parameter .",
    "this almost model - independent approach may be improved with additional theoretical information as well as using future experimental measurements at rhic , lhc , and tevatron colliders allowing more precise descriptions .",
    "furthermore , predictions in the momentum transfer space were performed and compared with those in the literature . in @xcite a more detailed discussion is presented .    on the other hand ,",
    "there exist a classical description of the scattering amplitude based on the impact parameter representation , which the corresponding amplitude is perpendicular to the beam direction and thus is the same in the laboratory and center - of - mass system .",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude in the momentum transfer space allows , in the impact parameter space , an estimate of the interacting particle sizes and an analysis of their internal structures .",
    "there are several papers about this theoretical approach in the literature with pros and cons @xcite .",
    "in particular , amaldi and schubert had performed a comprehensive and coherent analysis of @xmath0 data at isr energies , which had shown that the rise of the total cross section is a peripheral phenomenon @xcite .    using the well established parameterization taken from @xcite",
    "we investigate here the eikonal , profile , and inelastic overlap functions using the impact parameter representation via the fourier - bessel transform of the elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "numerical values of the fit parameters used here were obtained in the momentum transfer space from simultaneous fits for the total , differential cross section and @xmath9 parameter and then used to describe eikonal , profile and overlap functions in the impact parameter space .",

    "we consider elastic scattering amplitude in a simple geometrical picture using an impact parameter @xmath11 and the fourier - bessel transform of the transferred momentum @xmath12 . in this picture , the profile function is introduced in high energy diffractive processes to describe the shape of the collision partners in the plane transverse to the beam axis . assuming that longitudinal momentum transfer is negligible the profile function can be written in the impact parameter representation as @xcite    @xmath13=i{\\int_0}^{\\infty}bdbj_0(qb)\\mathrm{\\gamma}(s , b),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the energy in the center - of - mass system",
