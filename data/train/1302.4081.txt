    "quantum state estimation ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) is central to many , if not all , tasks that process quantum information .",
    "the characterization of a source of quantum carriers , the verification of the properties of a quantum channel , the monitoring of a transmission line used for quantum key distribution  all three require reliable quantum state estimation , to name just the most familiar examples .    in the typical situation that we are considering ,",
    "several independently and identically prepared quantum - information carriers are measured one - by - one by an apparatus that realizes a probability - operator measurement ( pom ) , suitably designed to extract the wanted information .",
    "the pom has a number of outcomes , with detectors that register individual information carriers ( photons in the majority of current experiments ) , and the data consist of the observed sequence of detection events ( `` clicks '' )  @xcite .",
    "the quantum state to be estimated is described by a statistical operator , the _ state _ , and the data can be used to determine an _ estimator _ for the state  another state that , so one hopes , approximates the actual state well .",
    "there are various strategies for finding such an estimator .",
    "thanks to the efficient methods that hradil , ehek , and their collaborators developed for calculating maximum - likelihood estimators ( mles , reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , mles have become the estimators of choice . for the given data ,",
    "the mle is the state for which the data are more likely than for any other state .",
    "since the data have statistical noise , one needs to supplement a point estimator with error bars of some sort_error regions _ , more generally , for higher - dimensional problems .",
    "ad - hoc recipes have been proposed for attaching a vicinity of states to a given point estimator , often relying on approximations valid only in the limit of a large amount of data ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for examples in quantum state estimation ) , or involves resampling of the data ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "by contrast , we wish to use systematic procedures for determining error or estimator regions from only the data that we _ did _ observe .",
    "we are , however , not considering estimator regions of any kind , but specifically _ maximum - likelihood regions _",
    "( mlrs ) . for the given data ,",
    "the mlr is that region of pre - chosen size , for which the data are more likely than any other region of the same size .",
    "the regions referred to here are regions in the space of quantum states ( more precisely : in the reconstruction space ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : reconsp ] ) .",
    "as we shall see , there is an intimate connection between the mle and the mlrs for the same data : all mlrs contain the mle , and in the limit of very small size , the mlr is a small vicinity of the mle .",
    "the `` size of a region '' is clearly an important notion here .",
    "we agree with evans , guttman , and swartz @xcite that , in the present context of state estimation , it is natural to measure the size of a region by its prior probability that the actual state lies in the region , that is : the probability that we assign to the region before any data are at hand .",
    "as they should , regions with the same size have the same prior probability ; and the whole state space has unit size @xmath0 unit prior probability because the actual state is surely somewhere in the state space .",
    "in addition to mlrs , we also consider _ smallest credible regions _",
    "the credibility of a region is its posterior probability , that is : the probability that the actual state lies in the region , conditioned on the data ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the scr , then , is the smallest region with the pre - chosen value of the credibility .",
    "it turns out that the problems of finding the mlr and the scr are duals of each other .",
    "each scr is also a mlr , and each mlr is a scr . in both cases ,",
    "the optimal regions contain all states for which the likelihood of the data exceeds a threshold value .",
    "in particular , in the limit of small credibility , the scr is a small vicinity of the mle .",
    "the _ confidence regions _ that were recently studied in the quantum context by christandl and renner @xcite , and by blume - kohout @xcite , are markedly different from the scrs and the mlrs .",
    "confidence regions give an answer to the following question : consider all conceivable data , all sequences of detector clicks that could possibly be obtained , and assign a region to each sequence ; how do we choose the regions such that a pre - chosen fraction of the regions ( the confidence level ) will surely contain the unknown actual state ?",
    "we contrast this with the corresponding question for the scr : consider all permissible states , each a candidate for the unknown actual state ; what is the smallest region , for the observed data , that contains the actual state with a pre - chosen probability ?",
    "the difference between the two questions is simple , yet profound .",
    "when asking for confidence regions , the data are regarded as the random variable ; whereas the observed data are given for the scr , and the unknown state is the random quantity . a further difference",
    "to note is that the sizes of the confidence regions play a minor role in their construction , whereas its size is a crucial property of a scr .",
    "here is a brief outline of the paper .",
    "we set the stage in sec .  [",
    "sec : defs ] where we introduce the reconstruction space , discuss the size of a region , and define the various joint and conditioned probabilities . equipped with these tools",
    ", we then formulate in sec .",
    "[ sec : or ] the optimization problems that identify the mlrs and scrs and find their solutions ; this is followed by remarks on confidence regions .",
    "criteria for choosing unprejudiced priors are the subject of sec .",
    "[ sec : prior ] , and simulated qubit measurements illustrate the matter in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] .",
    "we close with an outlook on the problems that need to be solved before mlrs and scrs can be computed efficiently for data acquired in actual experiments .",
    "the @xmath1 outcomes @xmath2 , @xmath3 ,  , @xmath4 of the pom , with which the data are acquired , are positive hilbert - space operators that decompose the identity ,",
    "@xmath5 if the state @xmath6 describes the system , then the probability @xmath7 that the @xmath8th detector will click for the next copy to be measured is @xmath9 which is the born rule , of course . here",
    ", @xmath6 can be any positive operator with unit trace , @xmath10 the positivity of @xmath6 and its normalization ensure the positivity of the @xmath7s and their normalization @xmath11 probabilities @xmath12 for which there is a state @xmath6 such that eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.2a ] ) holds , are _ permissible _ probabilities .",
    "they make up the _ probability space_.    the probability space for a @xmath1-outcome pom is usually smaller than that of a @xmath1-sided die because not all positive @xmath7s with unit sum are permitted by the born rule .",
    "the quantum nature of the state estimation problem enters _ only _ in these additional restrictions on @xmath13 : quantum state estimation is standard statistical state estimation with quantum constraints . the rich concepts and methods of statistical inference apply immediately to the quantum situation , modified where necessary to account for the restricted probability space .    whereas the @xmath7s are uniquely determined by @xmath6 in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.2a ] ) , the converse is only true if the pom is informationally complete . in any case",
    ", there is always a _ reconstruction space _ @xmath14 , a set of @xmath6s that contains exactly one @xmath6 for each set of permissible probabilities , consistent with the born rule .",
    "if there is more than one reconstruction space , it does not matter which one we choose .",
    "while the probability space is always convex , a convex reconstruction space may not be available .",
    "the reconstruction space is at most @xmath15-dimensional , and has a smaller dimension if fewer probabilities are independent .",
    "we note that @xmath1 is always finite , and so is the dimension of the reconstruction space .",
    "there are no real - life poms with an infinite number of outcomes .    as an example , consider a harmonic oscillator with its infinite - dimensional state space .",
    "if the pom has two outcomes with @xmath16 equal to the probability of finding the oscillator in its ground state , and @xmath17 , one reconstruction space is the set of convex combinations of the projector to the ground state and another state with no ground - state component . in this situation , there is a large variety of reconstruction spaces to choose from , because _ any _ other state serves the purpose , and all one can infer from the data is an estimate of the ground - state probability .",
    "now , state estimation is the task of finding a state , or a region of states , in the reconstruction space by a systematic and reliable procedure that exploits the observed data . in view of the one - to - one correspondence between the states in the reconstruction space and the permissible probabilities",
    ", one can identify the reconstruction space with the probability space .",
    "indeed , since the probability space is unique , while there can be many different reconstruction spaces , it is often more convenient to work in the probability space .",
    "the primary objective is then to find an estimator , or a region of estimators , for the probabilities @xmath13 .",
    "the conversion of the set of probabilities @xmath13 into a state @xmath6 is performed later , if at all , and only at this stage do we need to decide which reconstruction space is used for reference .",
    "if the pom is not informationally complete , it will be necessary to invoke additional criteria or principles for a unique mapping @xmath18 .",
    "for example , one could follow jaynes s guidance @xcite and maximize the entropy  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "prior to acquiring any data , we assign equal probabilities to equivalent alternatives . if we split the reconstruction space in two",
    ", it is equally likely that the actual state is in either half and , therefore , each half should carry a prior probability of @xmath19 , provided that the splitting - in - two is fair , that is : the two pieces are of equal size . a preconceived notion of size is taken for granted here .",
    "further fair splitting , into more disjoint regions of equal size , then suggests rather strongly that the prior probability of a region should be proportional to its size .",
    "we take this suggestion seriously : scale all region sizes such that the whole reconstruction space has unit size , and then the size of a region _ is _ its prior probability  its `` prior content '' if we borrow terminology from bayesian statistics .",
    "the identification `` size @xmath0 prior probability '' is technically possible because both quantities simply add if disjoint regions are combined into a single region .",
    "there is no room for mathematical inconsistencies here , unless we begin with a region - to - size mapping for which the reconstruction space can not be normalized to unit size , so that we would obtain improper prior probabilities .",
    "we are not interested in pathological cases of this or other kinds and just exclude them",
    ". should an improper prior be useful in a particular context , it should come about as the limit of a well - defined sequence of proper priors .",
    "the above line of reasoning can be reversed .",
    "should we have established each region s prior probability with other means ( perhaps invoking symmetry arguments or taking into account that the source under investigation is designed to emit the information carriers in a certain target state ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : prior ] ) , then we accept this as the natural measure of the region s size  @xcite .",
    "after all , the reconstruction space is an abstract construct that is not endowed with a self - suggesting unique metric , and a region s prior probability is the quantity that matters most in the present context of statistical inference .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the size of the infinitesimal vicinity of state @xmath6 . the size @xmath21 of a region @xmath22 is then obtained by integrating over the region , @xmath23 where the latter integration covers all of the reconstruction space . by construction ,",
    "the value of @xmath21 does not depend on the parameterization that we use for the numerical representation of @xmath20 .",
    "the primary parameterization is in terms of the probabilities , @xmath24 where the prior density @xmath25 is nonzero for all permissible probabilities and vanishes for all non - permissible @xmath13s . in particular",
    ", @xmath25 always contains @xmath26 as a factor and so enforces the constraints that the probabilities are positive and have unit sum  @xcite .",
    "if there are no other constraints , we have the probability space of a @xmath1-sided die . for genuine quantum measurements , however , there are additional constraints , some accounted for by more delta - function factors , others by step functions .",
    "the delta - function constraints reduce the dimension of the reconstruction space from @xmath27 to the number of independent probabilities .    for the harmonic - oscillator example of sec .",
    "[ sec : reconsp ] , which has the same probability space as a tossed coin , the factor @xmath28 selects the line segment with @xmath29 in the @xmath30 plane . if we choose the `` primitive prior '' @xmath31 , the subsegment with @xmath32 has size @xmath33 . for the jeffreys",

    "sec : examples ] below , it is easy to state quite explicitly the restrictions on the set of permissible probabilities that follow from the born rule . in other situations , it could be difficult or impossible .",
    "this is why state estimation is often done by searching for a statistical operator in a suitable state space . for practical reasons",
    ", it may be necessary to truncate the full state space  which can be , and often is , infinite - dimensional  to a test space of manageable size .",
    "with such a truncation one accepts that not all permissible probabilities are investigated .",
    "therefore , a criterion for judging if the test space is large enough is to verify that the estimated probabilities do not change significantly when the space is enlarged .",
    "examples for the artifacts that result from test spaces that are too small can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      the data @xmath36 acquired by the pom consist of a sequence of detector clicks , with a total of @xmath37 clicks of the @xmath8th detector , and a total number of @xmath38 clicks after measuring @xmath39 quantum - information carriers  @xcite .",
    "the probability of obtaining the data , _ if _ @xmath6 is the state , is the familiar _ point likelihood _ @xmath40 it attains its maximal value when @xmath6 is the mle @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath41 is in the reconstruction space , but the maximum could be taken over all states .",

    "instead of looking for the mle , the single point in the reconstruction space that has the largest likelihood for the given data @xmath36 , we desire a region with the largest likelihood  the mlr . for this purpose ,",
    "we maximize the region likelihood @xmath51 under the constraint that only regions with a pre - chosen size @xmath53 participate in the competition , with @xmath54 ; an unconstrained maximization of @xmath51 is not meaningful because it gives the limiting region that consists of nothing but the point @xmath41 .",
    "the resulting mlr @xmath55 is a function of the data @xmath36 and the size @xmath53 , but we wish to not overload the notation and will keep these dependences implicit , just like the notation does not explictly indicate the @xmath36 dependence of the mle @xmath41 .",
    "the mlr analog of the mle definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.8 ] ) is then @xmath56 since all competing regions have the same size , we can equivalently maximize the joint probability , @xmath57 the answer to this maximization problem is given in corollary  4 of ref .",

    "@xcite reviews various approaches to constructing unprejudiced priors .",
    "let us discuss some criteria that are useful when choosing a prior .",
    "a general remark is this : the chosen prior should give some weight to ( almost ) all states , and it should not give extremely high weight to states in some part of the state space and extremely low weight to other states .",
    "this is to say that the prior should be _ consistent _ in the sense that the credibility of a region ",
    "its posterior content  is dominated by the data , rather than by the prior , if a reasonably large number @xmath39 of copies is measured .",
    "the time - honored strategy of choosing a uniform prior gets us into a circular argument : the line of thought presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : sizeprior ] implements this strategy and leads to identifying the prior content of a region with its size .",
    "but that just means that we are now asked to declare how we measure the size of a region without prejudice , which is the original question about the prior .",
    "in fact , there is no unique meaning of the uniformity of a prior . in the sense that each prior tells us how to quantify the size of a region , each prior is uniform with respect to its induced size measure .",
    "this point can be illustrated with the harmonic - oscillator example of sec .",

    "[ sec : sizeprior ] , the parameterization @xmath118 gives @xmath119 where we integrate over @xmath120 in the last step and so observe that the primitive prior is uniform in @xmath121 , that is : the size of the region @xmath122 is proportional to @xmath123 .",
    "likewise , the parameterization @xmath124 gives @xmath125 for the jeffreys prior , which is uniform in @xmath126 .",
    "other priors can be treated analogously , each of them yielding a uniform prior in an appropriate single parameter .",
    "the parameterizations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:4.3 ] ) exhibit in which explicit sense the primitive prior and the jeffreys prior are uniform . but the priors are what they are , irrespective of how they are parameterized .",
    "they are explicitly uniform in a particular parameterization and implicitly uniform in all others .",
    "uniformity , it follows , can not serve as a principle that distinguishes one prior from another .",
    "this ubiquity of uniform priors for a continuous set of infinitesimal probabilities is in marked contrast to situations in which prior probabilities are assigned to a finite number of discrete possibilities , such as the @xmath127 pockets of a double - zero roulette wheel .",
    "uniform probabilities of @xmath128 suggest themselves , are meaningful , and clearly distinguished from other priors , all of which have a bias .",
    "uniformity in a particularly natural parameterization of the probability space might also be meaningful .",
    "this , however , invokes a notion of `` natural '' that others may not share .      in many applications , estimating",
    "the state is not a purpose in itself , but only an intermediate step on the way to determining some particular property of the physical system .",
    "the objective is to find the value of a parameter that quantifies the _ utility _ of the state .",
    "for example , one could be interested in the fidelity of the actual state with a target state , or in an entanglement measure of a two - partite state , or in another quantity that tells us how useful are the quantum - information carriers for their intended task .",
    "in a situation of this kind , one should , if possible , use a prior that is uniform in the utility parameter of interest .    as a simple example , consider a single qubit .",
    "the utility parameter is the purity @xmath129 of the state @xmath6 . with the bloch - ball representation of a qubit state , @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the bloch vector and @xmath132 is the vector of pauli matrices ,",

    "irrespective of what we choose for @xmath136 , the marginal prior for @xmath137 is uniform in @xmath138 .",
    "if one can quantify the utility of an estimator by a cost function , an optimal prior can be selected by a minimax strategy : for each prior in the competition one determines the maximum of the cost function over the states in the reconstruction space , and then chooses the prior for which the maximum cost is minimal . in classical statistics , such minimax strategies are common ( see , for instance , chapter  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; for an example in the context of quantum state estimation , see ref .",

    "symmetry considerations are often helpful in narrowing the search for the appropriate prior . for a particularly instructive example , see sec .",

    "( [ eq:4.x ] ) , one can invoke rotational symmetry in favor of the usual solid - angle element , @xmath139 , as the choice of angular prior .",
    "the reasoning is as follows : the purity of a qubit state does not change under unitary transformations ; unitarily equivalent states have the same purity .",
    "now , regions that are turned into each other by a unitary transformation have identical radial content whereas the angular dependences are related by a rotation .",
    "invariance under rotations , in turn , requires that the prior is proportional to the solid angle , hence the identification of @xmath136 with the differential of the solid angle .",
    "note that the resulting prior element @xmath20 is different from the usual euclidean volume element , @xmath140 , which would be natural if the bloch ball were an object in the physical three - dimensional space .",

    "we consider two particular constructions that make use of the metric induced by the response of the selected function to infinitesimal changes of its variables .",

    "therefore , a conjugate prior is quite a natural way of expressing the expectation that the apparatus is functioning well .",
    "the posterior content of a region will be data - dominated only if @xmath39 is much larger than @xmath126 .    in this context , it may be worth noting that the bayesian mean state , @xmath169 computed with the conjugate prior above , is usually not the target state unless @xmath126 is large",
