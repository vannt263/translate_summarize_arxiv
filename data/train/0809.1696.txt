    "electron transport through molecular - scale devices has become a very exciting research area for both experimentalists and theorists .",
    "the main reason for this interest originates from the possibility of extreme miniaturization in electronic devices . in recent years",
    ", hundreds of papers have been published to establish the connection between the microscopic characteristics of an electronic system , such as the atomic configuration and the electronic structure , and transport properties such as electrical current and conductance .",
    "these results have helped to improve the understanding of the i - v characteristics of nanojunctions .",
    "however , the interpretation of the i - v curves in terms of the geometry of the junction remains largely a fundamental challenge for molecular electronics .",
    "in fact , it has not yet been possible to establish a general theoretical model that can reliably deal with any molecular junction of arbitrary geometry .",
    "owing to the complexity of the system , these studies are strongly dependent on the existence of reliable theoretical treatments based on first - principles approaches . in some instances , even conventional approaches based on density - functional theory ( dft )",
    "are expected to break down , especially in the case of weak coupling @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , dft is expected to provide reliable results in a large number of cases .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , all the existing approaches to date , based on _ ab initio _ calculations , can deal with systems limited to two terminals only .",
    "it is therefore of widespread interest to develop robust computational schemes that can routinely and reliably account for the transport mechanism in multiterminal molecular devices .    in his seminal work",
    ", bttiker @xcite developed a conductance formula for a four - terminal system .",
    "however , that formula was not explicitly implemented in the framework of first - principles based calculations . moreover , since the idea of that paper was to propose a reliable method for voltage difference measurements , bttiker assumed that only two of the leads can carry current to and from the sample and the two others only measure the voltage .",
    "a similar non - atomistic approach based on tight - binding approximation has been presented by baranger _",
    "_ @xcite . within the framework of a luttinger liquid theory the four - terminal resistance of an interacting quantum wire was studied by arrachea _",
    "recently , jayasekera _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a four - terminal approach for magneto - transport properties based on r - matrix theory @xcite .",
    "however the approach is only applicable to two - dimensional devices , it is formulated in the framework of semi - empirical tight - binding , and does not include a self - consistent treatment of finite applied potential .",
    "finally , a mesoscopic treatment for phonon - assisted current through multiterminal conductors was formulated by rychkov _",
    "while these multiterminal approaches address important issues , they neither treat the system in an _ ab initio _ fashion , including atomistic details , nor do they account for the self - consistent ( sc ) rearrangement of electrons as the bias and the current increase .",
    "the importance of the self - consistency had been demonstrated in our previous paper @xcite , showing that negative differential resistance in the i - v characteristic can only be quantitatively studied when self - consistency is included .    in this paper",
    ", we present a generalized approach for computing conductance and i - v characteristics in multiterminal junctions , based on density - functional theory . in order to take into account the difference in electro - chemical potentials in different leads , we use non - equilibrium keldysh formalism .",
    "the electronic transport is formulated in the basis of an o(n ) method for electronic - structure calculations , which is an _ ab initio _ pseudopotential density functional approach using a linear combination of numerical atomic orbitals ( lcao ) basis that are optimized for the problem in hand @xcite .",
    "we apply external bias voltage through any lead in a realistic way and self - consistently compute the nonequilibrium green function for the nonequilibrium electron density of the multiterminal junction by solving poisson equation .",
    "one of the main advantages of our scheme is that we can apply bias through any number of leads and at the same time compute current between any two leads .",
    "the method is illustrated on two prototypical four - terminal systems ( i ) a radialene molecule connected to carbon chains , and ( ii ) two crossed carbon chains brought together closer and closer .",
    "we discuss the charge density , potential profile , and transmission of electrons between any two terminals .",
    "we also evaluate the current flowing between them .",
    "the algorithmic approach has been implemented on massively parallel computer architectures , and can therefore be applied to systems of realistic sizes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic theory is outlined in section  [ sec : theory ] , sketching a nonequilibrium green function formulation of the conductance calculations .",
    "the applications are discussed in section  [ sec : applications ] .",
    "the scheme is applied to two simple systems , addressing in particular the symmetry in transmission and effect of the different bias voltages on the i - v curves .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary in section  [ sec : concluding - remarks ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the theoretical aspects of conductance calculations .",
    "the general system setup , the coupling to the leads , the equilibrium and nonequilibrium density matrices , the implementation of the bias voltage through any number of leads , and the conductance formula are presented .",
    "we consider the prototypical multiterminal system sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sahafig1 ] .",
    "two or more semi - infinite leads @xmath0 are coupled to a central barrier region c with thermal reservoirs that are maintained at the electro - chemical potentials @xmath1 . within our approach ,",
    "region c can be treated as @xmath2 subregions as @xmath3 and , in principle , we may connect @xmath4-number of leads to them .",
    "note that an important hypothesis of the approach ( also implicit in all two - terminal approaches based on green function ) is that there are no direct interactions between the leads and they only interact via the barrier region .",
    "consequently the overlap integrals between orbitals on atoms situated in different leads take place via the barrier region only .    for reasons of simplicity",
    ", we will be discussing a four - terminal system as an example .",
    "however , the method can be readily generalized to any number of electrodes .",
    "suppose the leads @xmath5 and @xmath6 are connected to the molecular barrier @xmath7 via the subregions @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "at the beginning of the calculation , each subregion has the same potential and charge distribution as its respective connected lead .    in order to study the transport properties , in principle ,",
    "we need to invert an infinite hamiltonian of the infinite system which includes all parts of the semi - infinite leads .",
    "however , the electrons injected from the reservoirs move ballistically through the leads and all scattering events only occur around the barrier region ( molecular region ) , called extended - scattering region @xmath10 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sahafig2 ] ( left ) ] .",
    "the potential is modified only within a finite region of the leads , the one being connected to the barrier region .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to consider a finite hamiltonian containing all subregions @xmath11 and the barrier region @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix of this system is of finite rank and takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the hamiltonian matrices in the @xmath14th - lead and the molecular barrier respectively , and @xmath15 is the interaction between the @xmath14th - lead and the barrier @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath16 s are the self - energies that couple the scattering region to the remaining parts of the semi - infinite leads .",
    "the hamiltonian and the charge density matrix are assumed to be converged to the bulk values in the leads outside the scattering region . for practical calculations ,",
    "this assumption is tested by including larger fractions of the leads in the scattering region and by examining the charge convergence during the sc iterations . here",
    "the term `` charge convergence '' refers to the conservation of total charge in the scattering region .",
    "the charge convergence criterion is of crucial importance , since a failure to fulfill it would indicate bad numerical convergence or issues with the setup of the size of the extended region . by achieving the charge convergence ,",
    "we make sure that all the screening takes place within the scattering region .    the hamiltonian matrix in eq .",

    "[ fig : sahafig2 ] .",
    "one can rewrite the above hamiltonian matrix as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20    we proceed with the above tri - diagonal hamiltonian for multiterminal calculations in the same way as in a two - terminal case.@xcite the most time - consuming part is the calculation of the green functions , i.e. , the inversion of a matrix @xmath21 , where h is the hamiltonian matrix in eq .",

    "in fact , the numerical effort to invert the matrix is independent of the number of terminals .",
    "the matrix size ( or the system size ) and its sparsity play an important role in determining the computational cost .      in this subsection , we first outline the procedure adopted for computing the density matrix for a two - terminal system @xcite and then generalize it for a multiterminal system .    as explained in detail in ref .   for a two - terminal system , one may write the density matrix as @xmath22,\\ ] ] @xmath23_{\\nu\\nu ' } , i=1 , 2\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the indexes of localized orbitals in the extended scattering region , @xmath26 the green function , and @xmath27/2 $ ] is the coupling function for the @xmath14th - lead . @xmath28 $ ] is the self - energy of the @xmath14th - lead that couples it to the extended - scattering region .",

    "an applied bias can be simply a linear interpolation independent of the bias between the electrodes .",

    "first , one needs to make sure that the potentials of all electrodes ( outside the extended - scattering region @xmath10 ) will be unaffected by the applied bias voltage , in other words , the modified potential has to match at the boundary of each electrode and the region @xmath10 .",
    "second , the variation of the potential between any two electrodes through the molecular barrier has to be continuous and uniform .",
    "third , the electrostatic potential in the vacuum region between two arbitrary electrodes has to be realistic . in order to create such an initial profile for the planar molecules considered here ,",
    "we iteratively solve the 2d laplace s equation ( assuming the system is in the xy - plane ) in a hypothetical system where the extended scattering region is empty : @xmath60    with the following boundary conditions : ( a ) the initial potential in the scattering region is zero ( or may be the same as the potentials of the four leads ) , ( b ) the potential in every lead is unchanged , ( c ) the potential towards the vacuum region , that is , at the corners of the box , decays .    solving laplace equation yields an initial bias - potential profile , as shown in fig .",

    "the computations use a massively parallel real - space multigrid implementation @xcite of density - functional theory dft . @xcite the wave functions and localized orbitals",
    "are represented on a grid with spacing of 0.335 bohr . a double grid technique @xcite is employed to evaluate the inner products between the nonlocal potentials and the wave functions , thereby substantially reducing the computational cost and memory without loss of accuracy .",
    "we now describe our multi - level parallel implementation of the multiterminal transport theory outlined above .",
    "first , the matrices are distributed according to the two - dimensional block - cyclic data layout scheme used by scalapack .",
    "depending on the matrix size , one can use @xmath61 processors for matrix operations ( typically n = 1 to 4 in our applications ) .",
    "second , parallelization proceeds over the energy points used in the integration to obtain the charge density matrix .",
    "third , potentials and density matrices are also parallelized over the 3d processor grid @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the total number of processors .",
    "this step of parallelization drastically accelerates the poisson equation solver during the self - consistent iterations .",
    "fourth , parallelization over the bias points is trivial and can be achieved with nearly 100% efficiency .",
    "for the zero bias calculation , the computational cost for a multiterminal system is about the same as that for a two - terminal system if the number of atoms in the scattering region is the same .",
    "however , for the multiterminal system , an additional computational time is required for the nonequilibrium calculation .",
    "this is because , as the number of leads increases , the number of terms in the density matrix also increases ( see in eq . 6 ) .",
    "the most time - consuming part of the entire computation is the matrix inversion needs to calculate the green functions .",
    "this part scales nearly linearly if one takes into consideration the sparsity feature of the hamiltonian and overlap matrices .",
    "in order to illustrate the proposed approach for calculating the conductance of a multiterminal molecular device , we choose a four - terminal junction of radialene molecule connected to semi - infinite carbon chains as a first example . a schematic diagram is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sahafig4 ] .",
    "the system has c@xmath64 symmetry . applying our technique to this system",

    "@xcite the atom - centered orbitals are optimized variationally in the equilibrium geometry . in the radialene based system ,",
    "we include 48 atoms in the calculation and each atom has six orbitals with the radii of 9 bohr .",
    "a self - consistent calculation is carried out within an extended zone around the scattering region .",
    "for this system , the total charge is converged after 18 steps of the sc process , as shown in fig .  [",

    "the charge density determines the potential .",
    "[ fig : sahafig5 ] ( left ) shows the converged potential profile at zero bias 4.88 bohr above the atomic plane .",
    "the c@xmath64 symmetry of the system is reflected in its potential profile .",
    "after the convergence of the charge density is achieved for the equilibrium density matrix , we apply the bias voltage through the leads . at this stage , the nonequilibrium part of the density matrix ( see eq .  [ eq:10 ] ) is included through an iterative process . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sahafig5 ] ( right ) we show the converged potential profile after applying an identical bias of @xmath65 through all the leads .",
    "it again shows the four - fold symmetry as expected .",
    "it also shows that after the convergence , the potential matches very well at the boundary of the leads and the central molecule .",
    "we now examine the potential drop when different biases through the leads are applied . here , a bias of @xmath65 is applied at the leads @xmath5 , while the fourth lead @xmath6 is at zero bias . after solving the poisson equation",
    ", we observe a uniform potential drop between the leads @xmath66 and @xmath6 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sahafig6 ] ( left ) ) . for testing purposes",
    ", we have also plotted the hartree potential @xmath67 along the line connecting leads @xmath66 and @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sahafig6 ] ( right ) .",
    "once the potential profile is self - consistently determined , the transmission spectrum under the applied bias @xmath45 is calculated using the eq .",
    "[ eq : transmission ] .",
    "the transmission curves , shown in fig .  [ fig : sahafig7 ] , are computed for several bias voltages , with the voltages being the same at @xmath68 and @xmath69 , while @xmath70 is being kept at @xmath71 .",
    "the left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : sahafig7 ] show the transmission @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the carbon - atoms in the lead are fixed at equidistant bond length .",
    "it follows that the lead has metallic character and therefore no gap appears in the transmission curve ( as would be the case if the chain had been subjected to a jahn - teller distortion ) . with zero bias ,",
    "the transmission curve around the fermi level is almost constant .",
    "this nature of transmission is expected because the free - electron - like @xmath74-states of carbon contribute to the transmission . however , with increasing bias , the transmission curve starts to oscillate .",
    "the origin of the oscillation is related to the choice of electrode .",
    "here we used a simple , very idealized carbon chain made up of 8 atoms per lead . in order to examine the charge convergence in the scattering region , one needs to define a potential box around the molecule , where the poisson equation is solved .",
    "however , because of the small number of carbon atoms in the lead , the potential box needs to be quite large , encompassing major parts of the leads .",
    "this creates finite - size effects , which are reflected in the transmissions showing oscillations .",
    "as the bias is increased , the finite size effects also increase and this is why there are more oscillations in the transmission curves with higher bias .",
    "therefore , the these oscillations are an artifact of the small number of atoms in our `` test '' leads .",
    "however , realistic molecular systems , with either thicker nanowires or bulk surfaces , do not show these artifacts .",
    "our investigations of two - terminal systems @xcite further demonstrate this claim .",
    "in addition , our ongoing investigations on more realistic four - terminal molecular junctions ( to be communicated soon ) are free of such oscillations .    note that",
    "because of the c@xmath64 symmetry of the system , the transmissions @xmath75 and @xmath76 at zero bias are identical ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "for the same reason , the transmission contributions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are equivalent ( not shown in figure ) .",

    "[ fig : sahafig8 ] . the current contributions through leads @xmath76 ( red line ) and @xmath78 ( blue line )",
    "are obtained in the voltage window @xmath81 .",
    "both curves are increasing almost linearly because of the constant transmission around the fermi energy .      as a second example",
    ", we have chosen a four - terminal system consisting of two crossed carbon chains .",
    "our objective is to vertically bring the carbon chains closer and closer , and to see how the current varies with the distance between the chains , possibly leading to a crossover from low to high coupling . in our study , we consider three distances between the chains , @xmath82 7.5 , 5.0 and 2.5 bohr . to build the system",
    ", we include a total of 66 carbon atoms , with 33 atoms in each chain .",
    "every atom has 6 basis orbitals with the radius of 9 bohr , as in previous example . a schematic diagram of the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sahafig9 ] .",
    "after the charge convergence is achieved , we apply a @xmath83 bias through leads @xmath5 and a @xmath84 bias through the fourth lead @xmath6 .",
    "the converged potential and the charge density of the equilibrium system ( i.e. , at zero bias ) is used as the initial guess for the convergence of the new nonequilibrium system .",
    "[ fig : sahafig10 ] ( left - top and bottom ) shows the converged potential profiles of the system when the distances between the two carbon chains are 7.5 and 5.0 bohr , respectively .",
    "the plotting plane is parallel to the chains and passes through one of them .",
    "both figures are symmetric about the line connecting leads @xmath66 and @xmath6 .",
    "to observe the potential drop along this line more clearly , we plot the hartree potentials as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sahafig10 ] [ ( b ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "if the two chains are sufficiently away from each other , e.g. , separated by 7.5 bohr , the potential drop between two leads is smooth , and thus electron tunneling along a given chain will be the largest in this case .",
    "as we bring the chains closer , e.g. , to a distance of 5.0 bohr , the probability for an electron to tunnel from one chain to the other increases significantly .",
    "[ fig : sahafig11 ] shows the transmission curves in all three cases computed through leads @xmath76 ( left panel ) and @xmath78 ( right panel ) with zero and non - zero biases .",
    "we applied the same bias as in fig .",

    "the transmission of a system consisting of a single ideal lead must be equal to the number of scattering channels at the energy @xmath85.@xcite if the carbon chains are far away from each another , e.g. , at a distance of 7.5 bohr , the overlap integral between orbitals on atoms situated in two different leads is close to zero .",
    "therefore , each lead in the system will tunnel current as an isolated electrode .",
    "this is why we observe a constant transmission through @xmath76 , while the transmission through @xmath78 is almost zero , as expected . in a carbon chain system , a two - fold degenerate band crosses the fermi level .",
    "consequently , there are two scattering channels and @xmath86 .",
    "as we decrease the distance between the chains , to 5.0 and 2.5 bohr , the orbital overlaps between the chains become larger and larger .",
    "this results in a decrease in transmission @xmath76 and increase for @xmath78 . the total transmission that would occur only through @xmath72 in the bare lead case ,",
    "is now partially distributed to the other channels . at a finite bias ,",
    "the transmission curves start to oscillate .",
    "as explained in the subsection  [ subsec : radialene ] , these oscillations are due to electrons that are attracted to the central region , thereby conserving the static charge and creating an `` electron - in - a - box '' effect with corresponding standing - wave - like oscillations .    fig .",
    "[ fig : sahafig12 ] shows the flow of current through the channels @xmath76 ( left panel ) and @xmath78 ( right panel ) .",
    "we apply bias @xmath87 through the leads @xmath5 and bias @xmath88 through @xmath6 , and compute the current for distances 7.5 , 5.0 and 2.5 bohr between the carbon chains . in all cases , as the bias increases ,",
    "the current increases almost linearly .",
    "however , the nonlinearity is expected to be larger in a semiconducting system .",
    "it should be noticed that the current contribution through the @xmath76 channel increases with an increase of the distance between the chains , while the current flow through the @xmath78 channel decreases .",
    "note that the currents through the @xmath78 and @xmath80 channels are identical because of the symmetry of the system .",

    ", we use a compact atom - centered optimized orbitals obtained with a linear scaling method ( n is the number of electrons ) for computing the electronic properties of the lead and the central region .",
    "this basis is used to expand the green functions , the transmission function , and the charge density under bias , which are self - consistently determined via contour integration .",
    "the methodology is developed to scale well on massively - parallel computers , and should therefore be applicable to systems of realistic sizes .    to demonstrate the suitability of the new technique for studying electron transport in multiterminal junctions , we have chosen two very simple four - terminal systems as test applications . in the first example , a radialene system having @xmath93 symmetry is used to test the conservation of symmetry and the numerical robustness of our implementation . in the second example , we have examined the conductance properties of two crossed carbon chains . the i - v characteristics of the chains show the expected trends with the changing strength of interactions .",
    "these demonstrations establish the general applicability of the method . since our code is efficient and highly parallel , we are able to deal with rather large systems .",
