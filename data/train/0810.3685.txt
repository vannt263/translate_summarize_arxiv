    "in the classical view of hii  region formation ob stars form inside giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "any newly formed ob star emits extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation ( @xmath10 ev ) and ionizes the surrounding medium of a molecular cloud , creating an hii  region .",
    "the ionizing photons have more energy than is necessary to ionize the gas , however , and thus some excess energy heats the ambient gas . because of the pressure difference between the cold , natal molecular cloud ( @xmath1130 k ) and the hii  region ( @xmath11@xmath12k ) , the ionization front expands into the molecular cloud .",
    "a photodissociation region ( pdr ) exists beyond the ionization front .",
    "the pdr is a zone where photons of energies lower than 13.6 ev ionize elements with low ionization potentials and dissociate molecules ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of dense pdrs ) .",
    "within the pdr there are three important boundaries . at @xmath13 @xmath14 ,",
    "a dissociation front exists where @xmath15 replaces h as the dominant species .",
    "further from the emitting star , at @xmath16 , there is a boundary between @xmath17 where carbon becomes stored predominantly in the co molecule .",
    "the final boundary of the pdr occurs at the @xmath18 transition , @xmath19 .",
    "the pdr is therefore a transition region between the hii  region and the molecular cloud ; it is completely ionized at one boundary and completely molecular at the other .",
    "since all hii  regions should produce pdrs , in this simplified view all hii  regions should have associated molecular gas when they first form . as",
    "the nebulae evolve , however , the ob stars can travel far enough to leave the environs of their natal molecular clouds .",
    "complicating this simple scenario is the fact that molecular clouds are clumpy and inhomogeneous on all scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a clumpy medium , euv photons can penetrate to different depths , creating non - spherical ionization fronts .",
    "additionally , hii  regions evolve by moving away from their natal cloud environments and displacing the local gas . understanding the complicated interaction between young stars , hii  regions , and molecular gas is crucial to the study of massive star formation and the impact massive stars have on their environment .",
    "the molecular component of hii  regions has been studied in detail by many authors .",
    "most studies , however , have focused mainly on ultra - compact ( uc ) hii  regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when compact hii  regions were observed in co ,",
    "they were often only observed with single pointings using single - dish telescopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as our results show , co gas is frequently offset from the nominal position of an hiiregion .",
    "a completely sampled map is required to understand fully the dynamics and properties of molecular gas associated with hiiregions .",
    "furthermore , a sample with hii  regions at all evolutionary stages is necessary to understand how this interaction progresses as the hii  region ages .",
    "here we describe a large scale study of the molecular properties of diffuse , compact , and ultra - compact galactic hii  regions using fully sampled co maps .",
    "we trace these molecular properties using the @xmath0 @xmath20 emission mapped by the boston university  five college radio astronomy observatory ( hereafter bu ",
    "fcrao ) galactic ring survey ( grs : * ? ? ?",
    "co is an excellent tracer of molecular material because of its high abundance and the fact that it is rotationally excited at densities common in molecular clouds ( @xmath21500@xmath22 ) .",
    "our galactic hii  region source sample is compiled from the hii  region radio recombination line ( rrl ) catalog of @xcite ( hereafter l89 ) , which consists of nearly 500 rrl observations with a 3  beam at positions of known continuum emission .",
    "these continuum emission sources were drawn from the 5 @xmath23 continuum survey of @xcite .",
    "all positions in @xcite with a peak flux density greater than 1 @xmath24  and many sources with peak flux densities down to 0.8 @xmath24  were observed , unless the source was in a very confused region or was a known supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "since @xcite has coverage from @xmath25 to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the l89 catalog is complete down to a flux limit of at least 1 @xmath28  at 5 @xmath23  in this region of the galaxy .",
    "this sky coverage entirely overlaps and is much larger than the grs survey zone ( discussed in  [ grs ] ) , so the l89 catalog is complete at least down to 1@xmath24  over the extent of the grs .",
    "the sources in l89 are the classical hii  regions first detected in the 1970 s at cm - wavelengths using rrls .",
    "although they are often misidentified , these are not the ultra compact , high density hiiregions that are being studied mostly using radio interferometers .",
    "below , to distinguish these classical hii  regions from uc nebulae , we will call the l89 nebulae `` compact '' hii  regions .",
    "our nebular sample also includes diffuse hii  regions from @xcite ( hereafter l96 ) .",
    "this catalog consists of rrl measurements at 6@xmath1  ( @xmath29 beam ) and 9@xmath1  ( @xmath30 beam ) toward 130 faint , extended continuum sources .",
    "most of these sources are drawn from @xcite and have peak flux densities greater than 0.5 @xmath24 .",
    "the l89 survey is actually the pilot study of this diffuse sample ; it contains 40 diffuse sources .",
    "recently a large catalog of 1442 galactic hii  regions was compiled from 24 published studies of galactic hii  regions @xcite .",
    "these hii  regions were found using single - dish , medium resolution ( few arcminute beamwidths ) observations .",
    "for our purposes , however , this catalog is not useful because nebular positions are given to an accuracy of only 6 .",
    "finally , our source sample contains uc hii  regions taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the @xcite uc sources were selected by : ( 1 ) the presence of a small or unresolved radio source , ( 2 ) a spectrum consistent with free - free emission , and ( 3 ) strong fir emission .",
    "the uc sources from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were selected based on the @xcite criteria : _ iras _ flux density ratios log@xmath31 , log@xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 for @xcite ) , where @xmath35 is the _ iras _ flux density at @xmath36 .",
    "we use the bu ",
    "fcrao @xmath0 galactic ring survey data @xcite to characterize the molecular properties of all hii  regions in the grs .",
    "the grs traces the 5 @xmath38  molecular ring discovered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this annulus of enhanced co emission dominates the inner galaxy s structure and harbors most of the galaxy s star formation regions .",
    "the grs sky coverage spans @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "additional , incomplete sky coverage is available for @xmath41 over the same latitude range .",
    "the grs covers a total of 74 square degrees .",
    "the grs maps the distribution of emission from the @xmath42 ( @xmath43 @xmath23 ) rotational transition of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0  isotopologue is @xmath44 times less abundant than @xmath45 and hence has a much smaller optical depth .",
    "this decreased optical depth yields smaller line widths and gives a cleaner separation of individual velocity components along any specific line of sight compared to previous @xmath45  surveys .",
    "the grs , with a spectral resolution of @xmath46 , an angular resolution of @xmath47 , and a @xmath48 angular sampling , improves upon all previous large scale co surveys .",
    "it is the only fully sampled ( in solid angle ) large scale @xmath0  survey extant .",
    "the grs improves upon the bell labs @xmath0 survey @xcite that has a spectral resolution of @xmath49 , an angular resolution of @xmath50 and @xmath51 angular sampling .",
    "the grs also has better resolution than previous @xmath45 surveys .",
    "for example , the university of massachusetts stony brook survey @xcite has a spectral resolution of @xmath52 , an angular resolution of @xmath53 and @xmath51 angular sampling .",
    "the columbia / cfa @xmath45 survey @xcite has a spectral resolution of @xmath54 , an angular resolution of 450 and @xmath55 to @xmath56 angular sampling . compared to grs , _ all _ of these surveys are severely undersampled in angle .",
    "the grs maps have spectra observed at positions separated by @xmath57 the telescope s beamwidth ( 0.48 hpbw , actually ) .",
    "this , together with high spectral resolution allows us to separate individual @xmath0 components cleanly .",
    "thus we can for the first time study the molecular properties of galactic hii  regions free from angular sampling bias .",
    "here we study the molecular properties of all known hii  regions in the zone mapped by the grs .",
    "our sample of 301 hii  regions contains 123 uc , 105 compact , and 73 diffuse nebulae . for uc nebulae without rrl measurements in the original papers , we compile rrl velocities from @xcite and @xcite or , if the uc and compact sources were co - spatial , from l89 .",
    "the compact nebulae are from the l89 catalog .",
    "the majority of our diffuse regions are from l96 , but a small number are from the pilot survey of diffuse regions in l89 .",
    "this final nebular sample results from further vetting of the  2 sources using data from several recently completed galactic scale sky surveys that overlap the grs zone .",
    "we verify the existence , classification , and position of each hiiregion by examining the radio continuum and infrared emission at its nominal position . for the radio continuum emission",
    ", we primarily use the 21 cm vla galactic plane survey ( vgps : * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the 21 cm hi  line emission data cubes , the vgps generated 21 cm continuum images over the range @xmath58 with @xmath59 resolution .",

    "the 20 @xmath1  magpis data cover the range @xmath61 .",

    "both infrared surveys have coverage beyond the extent of the grs . for inclusion in our sample",
    ", we require a continuum peak at the position of each hii  region .",
    "the uc regions were identified by their iras colors and the compact and diffuse regions were located in radio continuum maps with @xmath62 resolution . both of these identification methods have some level of error that can be reduced through correlation with high resolution radio continuum data . for uc regions , continuum observations",
    "are necessary to confirm that the nebula is an hii  region , and not a dense protostellar clump .",
    "the sources from @xcite and @xcite were confirmed to be uc regions with vla continuum observations , but the majority of sources from @xcite and @xcite have not yet been confirmed with high resolution ratio data .",
    "we exclude 11 uc sources , 2 compact sources and 2 diffuse sources that do not have significant continuum emission .",
    "we remove all known snr from our sample by comparing our positions with the catalog of @xcite as well as with two recent catalogs of snrs by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both of these recent catalogs compute the spectral index of snr candidates using 20@xmath1  and 90@xmath1  vla continuum data and rely on the anticorrelation of snrs with infrared emission ( 8  _ msx _ data in the case of @xcite and 21  _ msx _ data for @xcite ) .",
    "we exclude 13 snrs from our sample that were found in these catalogs , as well as one found in @xcite .",
    "there are a comparable number of sources that are spatially coincident with snrs , but which have a strong ir component .",
    "we believe these are hii  regions in locations that have produced multiple generations of stars .",
    "these sources are retained in our sample .",
    "we also remove an additional six sources that do not have infrared emission since they most likely are non - thermal .    finally , we determine if the classification ( uc , compact , diffuse ) and position of each source are correct , and remove duplicate sources .",
    "we require uc hii  regions to have small ( @xmath63 ) bright knots of continuum emission , compact regions to be larger bright continuum sources , and diffuse regions to have faint extended continuum emission .",
    "there are many cases where an uc region was mistakenly identified as a compact or diffuse region in the l89 and l96 catalogs .",
    "this misidentification is due to the fact that ucs are unresolved with the 26 beam of @xcite from which l89 and l96 drew their positions .",
    "we exclude 69 compact and diffuse nebulae whose positions are coincident with uc regions",
    ". many of the uc hii  regions found in the grs are in large complexes with individual uc components separated by angular distances less than the @xmath64 grs beam .",
    "we treat these complexes as single uc regions because they share a common molecular gas clump at the grs resolution .",
    "table [ tab : anomalous ] lists the 38 hii  regions we cull from our sample because of the criteria just described .",
    "table [ tab : anomalous ] gives the source name , the reason for exclusion from our sample , and the reference if the source is a known snr .",
    "source names identify the nebular type : uc ( `` u '' ) , compact ( `` c '' ) , or diffuse ( `` d '' ) .",
    "this source name convention will be followed throughout this paper .",

    "listed are the source name , its position in galactic and equatorial coordinates and its rrl velocity with its @xmath65 error .",
    "altogether our 301 hii  region sources probe 266 unique directions since 33 nebulae have rrl emission at several different velocities that presumably originates from physically distinct nebulae located along the line of sight .",
    "for some hii  regions , we change the classification based on the morphology of the vgps and magpis radio continuum emission .",
    "we also change the position of a few hii  regions based on this continuum emission if the position is obviously incorrect .",
    "all such changes are noted with footnotes in table [ tab : diffuse ] .",
    "to characterize the properties of molecular gas associated with galactic hii  regions we must establish reliable morphological correlations in ( _ l , b , v_)space between the @xmath0  gas and the nebulae .",
    "the grs is a large ( @xmath66 ) , dataset that contains very complex @xmath0  emission line structure .",
    "the ( @xmath67 ) structure of the molecular gas near the nebulae can be very complicated .",
    "any given line of sight frequently contains multiple emission lines .",
    "there probably is no single algorithm that can uniquely give reliable co / hii  regoim ( _ l , b , v _ ) morphological correlations .",
    "we therefore use a suite of software tools to analyze the grs data cubes in a variety of ways .      to maximize the power and flexibility of our analysis",
    "we wrote a large suite of idl procedures for spectral analysis rather than use any of the standard single - dish radio astronomy software packages .",
    "we used the single - dish radio astronomy tmbidl software as our starting point .",
    "tmbidl was originally written to analyze nrao green bank telescope data .",
    "( tmbidl was the inspiration that led to the nrao gbtidl software . )",
    "the tmbidl software emulates and improves upon many of the features of the nrao unipops analysis program .",
    "it includes gaussian and polynomial line fitting , data visualization , data manipulation , etc .",
    "the tmbidl code can easily be modified to analyze data from any single dish radio telescope .",
    "we wrote additional idl procedures to interface and analyze grs data within the tmbidl environment .",
    "tmbidl was created to analyze single spectra , so we added ( _ l - v _ ) , ( _ b - v _ ) , and ( _ l - b _ ) mapping tools to better visualize the grs ( @xmath68 ) data cubes .",
    "the basic visualization is a normalized contour map of the co emission . using these tools",
    ", we found that the morphology of the co emission at the positions of the hii  regions was often very complex .",
    "to gain further control over the visualization of the grs data , we wrote gui - based software to analyze images extracted from the grs ( _ l , b , v _ ) fits data cubes .",
    "this software provides powerful gui tools to extract , image , and analyze subcubes for each sample hii  region . for our analysis",
    "we imaged various quantities for an ( _ l , b _ ) zone surrounding each nebula .",
    "the user can , for example , easily modify the velocity channel whose @xmath0  line intensity is being imaged over the mapped region .",
    "one can also quickly create and display integrated intensity co maps , @xmath69k @xmath70 , as well as arbitrarily vary the velocity range of the integration , @xmath71 .",
    "( this is done with a kernel based algorithm that is fast and efficient . )",
    "sub - images and regions can be created for any image , saved and then reloaded at any time",
    ". the gui uses ds9 syntax to define regions .",
    "these regions can have all the basic ds9 shapes .",
    "we added a `` threshold '' region that selects all contiguous pixels above a user - defined threshold level that surround a given image pixel . using this thresholding tool",
    "one can identify and analyze arbitrarily complex morphologies .",
    "this gui - software is fully integrated with tmbidl .",
    "the user can , for example , export the spectra within any region to tmbidl for spectral analysis .",
    "the ability to scan quickly through velocity channels , create integrated intensity images , select pixels and fit gaussians to spectra  all within a single application  is extremely powerful .      our goal is to find a morphological coincidence in ( _ l , b , v _ )",
    " space between the co gas and the hii  region . after a coincidence",
    "is established , we want to characterize the molecular gas using spectral fits to the @xmath0  emission .",
    "the uc positions are in general known to an accuracy greater than the @xmath72 grs pixel spacing . for the compact and diffuse hii  regions , our positions are accurate to a few arcminutes .",
    "the rrl lsr velocities are accurate to @xmath73 ( from gaussian fits ) .",
    "although the ( _ l , b , v _ ) position of each nebula is accurately known , establishing a robust set of criteria for identifying a real molecular / hii  physical association is nontrivial",
    ".    the co emission maps of hii  regions can be quite complex due to gmc structure and pdr / ionization front interactions .",
    "for example , one expects the molecular and ionized gas velocities to diverge as an hiiregion evolves .",
    "once an ob star forms within a gmc its ionization front ( if ) expands rapidly at first , reaching the nebular strmgren radius in @xmath74 yr .",
    "the if pushes the surrounding gmc molecular gas outwards .",
    "@xcite show that as the if expands , it rapidly slows until it is expanding at @xmath75 when it reaches the strmgren radius .",
    "since hii  regions are generally older than @xmath76 yr ( with the possible exception of some uc hii  regions ) , the maximum difference between the rrl and the associated molecular gas should be @xmath77 .",
    "our nebular sample has hii  regions of different ages and thus should show evolutionary effects .",
    "diffuse hii  regions should be older than the uc nebulae , and thus have had more time to evolve away from and displace their natal clouds .",
    "the molecular gas in diffuse hii  regions should show a weaker association or may not be present at all .",
    "we expect the majority of uc and compact hii  regions to be associated with a molecular clump ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of these complications , our co / hii  analysis is comprised of a series of distinct investigations .",
    "we first examine the grs @xmath0  spectrum at the nominal position of each hii  region .",
    "most previous studies of the molecular component of hii  regions were made using single pointings , e.g. , @xcite ; russiel & castets ( 2004 ) .",
    "all report that the majority of hii  regions have associated co. @xcite found in their survey of @xmath45emission from southern hii  regions that molecular gas within 5 @xmath78of the rrl velocity had large line intensities , and therefore was probably associated with the hii  region . in their analysis of southern compact hii  regions using both @xmath45  and @xmath0 , @xcite argued that 10 @xmath78  is a better criterion for determining a molecular / hiiassociation .    to make a single pointing co / hii  comparison we calculate an average @xmath0  spectrum at the position of each hii  region by convolving the grs datacube ( which is oversampled in angle ) with the fcrao telescope beam ( hpbw = @xmath79 ) .",
    "we then search this average spectrum for a @xmath0  emission line peak at the hii  region rrl velocity .",
    "specifically , we look for emission above 0.5@xmath80  brightness temperature , @xmath81 , and within @xmath82 of the hiiregion lsr velocity .",
    "our brightness temperature limit is chosen to be well above the grs noise .",
    "the grs data have a typical rms sensitivity of @xmath83 .",
    "the beam convolved average spectrum has a factor of @xmath84 decrease in noise compared to a single grs position .",
    "thus our 0.5@xmath80search criterion is a @xmath85 limit .    using the 0.5k and @xmath86 criteria",
    ", only 52 % of the nebular sample shows a co / hii  association . repeating this procedure with the same intensity requirement , but with velocity ranges of @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    ", we find that , respectively , @xmath89 and @xmath90 of hii  regions meet these criteria . certainly increasing the velocity range further still will yield a greater number of nebulae matching the association criteria , but relaxing the association definition in this way also increases the chance of a misidentification and the possibility of blending multiple velocity components .",
    "we use the grs data to make an ( _ l , b _ ) contour map of the @xmath0integrated intensity , @xmath69  ( k @xmath78 ) , in order to provide information about the spatial distribution of the molecular gas .",
    "the main weakness of the single pointing method of searching for co / hiiregion associations is that sources with molecular gas offset from the nominal position of the hii  region are not counted as detections . for each nebula",
    "we use tmbidl to make normalized @xmath69  contour maps that are @xmath91 ( @xmath92 grs pixels ) in size .",
    "the map @xmath69  is calculated by integrating each spectrum over @xmath93 centered at the rrl velocity .",
    "the map peak @xmath69is used to normalize the @xmath69  value for each pixel .",
    "the final product is a normalized contour map for each nebula in the sample .",
    "we then search each map for @xmath69 peaks and note the distance from the 80% peak @xmath69  contour to the nominal hii  region position .",
    "we define any source where this distance lies within the hii  region positional error bars to be a positive detection and any source where this distance is just outside of the error bars ( roughly twice the positional uncertainty ) to be an ambiguous detection .",
    "all sources not meeting these positional criteria are deemed to be non - detections .",
    "we find that 70% of our sample nebulae show positive detections , 14% have ambiguous detections , and 16% show no correlation between the hii  region position and the @xmath0  emission .",
    "somewhat suprisingly , adding the molecular spatial distribution information to the co / hiiassociation criterion did not add significantly to the detection rate .",
    "clearly , the molecular emission in the grs is complicated and difficult to characterize . these experiments in establishing a co / hii  region association",
    "demonstrate the need for a more sophisticated analysis .",
    "we use the  [ sec : software ] gui software to search the grs @xmath0 data cubes in ( @xmath68 ) parameter space . for each nebula",
    "we make a series of ( @xmath95 ) @xmath69  images and search for co / hii  region associations .",
    "we follow the four step iterative procedure described below and illustrated in figure [ fig:3plot ] .    1 .",
    "we first find the velocity range of the molecular emission associated with the hii  region .",
    "we examine single velocity channel images ( position - position ( _ l , b _ ) maps ) centered at the nominal position of the hii  region at its rrl velocity with overlaid vgps 21 cm continuum contours .",
    "we scan through these single channel images over @xmath96 of the source rrl velocity , searching for the channel where the molecular emission at the position of the hiiregion has the highest intensity .",
    "if we are able to identify a molecular clump near the position of the hii  region , we extract the spectra from the voxels near this molecular clump .",
    "we fit a gaussian to the ( unweighted ) average spectrum of this extracted emission and record the line center and fwhm of the emission line .",
    "frequently , the molecular emission at the hii  region position is either absent or has a morphology that is difficult to characterize from single channel maps . for @xmath97 of our nebulae",
    "we are unable to make a molecular gas association from these single channel maps",
    "next we make an integrated intensity map , @xmath69 , by summing the intensities at a given ( _ l , b _ ) over the range of velocities found in step ( 1 ) .",
    "if the source has an unambiguous co / hii  association , we calculate @xmath69 over the velocity range @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the step ( 1 ) gaussian line velocity and @xmath71 is its fwhm line width . if the source has an ambiguous step ( 1 ) association , we calculate @xmath69 centered at the source rrl velocity over the range @xmath100 .",
    "we then use the @xmath69 image created in step ( 2 ) to find pixels with molecular emission associated with the hii  region .",
    "we find the brightest emission near the hii  region in the @xmath69 image and select all contiguous pixels that have values above a threshold determined independently for each hii  region .",
    "the threshold is varied until a small number of pixels are selected  typically 20 to 30 .",
    "the exact number is set by the molecular clump s intensity profile .",
    "small clumps with a sharply peaked intensity profile have fewer pixels , whereas larger clumps with a `` plateau '' of emission have more pixels .",
    "this method seeks to isolate single clumps in order to preserve the line peak intensity and minimize blending of multiple velocity components .",
    "all the grs spectra within the ( @xmath95 ) region selected in step ( 3 ) are used to calculate an average @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "we then fit the fewest possible number of gaussian components to the spectrum in order to maximize the intensity of the peak co emission . the majority ( @xmath101 ) of our sources",
    "are adequately fit with only one gaussian component .",
    "many nebulae , however , do not have clean gaussians profiles , but rather show structure that often suggests a fainter , wider line superposed on a brighter , narrower line .    our analysis procedure is summarized in figure [ fig:3plot ] for the hii  region u43.24@xmath1020.05 . panels a and b depict step 1 .",

    "the cross marks the nominal hii  region position . for clarity",
    "we have not shown the vgps continuum emission contours .",
    "the black box shows the ( @xmath95 ) positions of the voxels from which we extract spectra to produce the average spectrum shown in panel b. the vertical line in panels b and d marks the rrl velocity . using the velocity range of the emission line shown as dashed lines in panel b , we create the integrated intensity image shown in panel c ( step 2 ) .",
    "this image has been smoothed with a @xmath103 gaussian kernel .",
    "the black outline in panel c shows contiguous integrated intensity values above a threshold ( step 3 ) .",
    "this region and its threshhold is defined by visual inspection of the image .",
    "this is the @xmath0  emission we deem to be associated with the hiiregion . finally , we extract the spectra from these ( @xmath95 ) positions to produce the average spectrum shown in panel d ( step 4 ) . for this source ,",
    "our method separates the two emission lines that are blended in the panel b spectrum and preserves the peak line intensity .    in principle",
    ", we could iterate our analysis to locate and fit the molecular emission more accurately . using the panel d gaussian fit",
    ", we could create a new integrated intensity image , define a new co / hiiassociation region , and fit a gaussian to this new average spectrum .",
    "we did this for 10 test cases and found only only minimal changes that were not significantly different from a single pass analysis .",

    "we are able to characterize the spectral properties of molecular gas distributions that have arbitrary morphologies .",
    "we minimize our assumptions at every stage of the process . by first examining the ( _ l , b _ ) images of each source at individual velocity channels , we limit false detections that may arise from integrated intensity images containing multiple velocity components blended together . by extracting the spectra from regions defined in the integrated intensity images",
    ", we make no assumptions based on the visual appearance of the molecular emission at individual velocity channels . by using a variable threshold to select pixels ,",
    "we are able to characterize molecular structures with arbitrary morphology .",
    "this threshold definition ensures clean spectral fitting ; the spectra are not contaminated by adjacent pixels that would lower the line intensity and might increase the width of the fitted gaussian line .",
    "finally , since we analyze an average of many spectra , the lines we fit have a much greater signal to noise ratio than a single pointing spectrum .",
    "the gaussian fit uncertainties in the spectral line parameters we derive are thus minimized .",
    "after we establish a co / hii  region association , we characterize the angular size of the molecular cloud by fitting an ellipse to the @xmath69spatial distribution . since the association defined in panel c of figure [ fig:3plot ]",
    "is a @xmath69  threshold value that is determined independently for each source , the size of an ellipse fitted to this zone would have little physical meaning .",
    "we therefore define a new threshold selected region that is uniform for the entire nebular sample .",

[ eq : tex ] holds as long as : ( 1 ) the @xmath45 and @xmath0 emitting gas is in lte at the same excitation temperature ; ( 2 ) this gas fills the same volume without clumping ; and ( 3 ) there are no background continuum sources .",
    "( for our nebulae the hii  region continuum is subtracted when the spectral baselines are removed . )    for each nebula we first compute an average spectrum from the umsb survey datacube in exactly the same way as we did for the grs data .",

    "each pixel in the umsb survey represents @xmath132 pixels in the grs .",
    "each threshold selected region contains @xmath133 grs pixels on average , so for the majority of our sources we use only one umsb pointing to estimate the excitation temperature appropriate for the @xmath45  emission .",
    "furthermore , this pointing can be as far away as @xmath134 from the grs position .",
    "the distribution of excitation temperatures we derive is shown in figure [ fig : t_ex ] .",
    "all hii  regions in our sample have very similar excitation temperatures near the standard 10k value assumed for molecular clouds .",
    "we expected the excitation temperature of the uc regions in particular to be higher than this standard value as the co gas is nearer to the exciting star . that we do not see hotter temperatures associated with younger regions is probably due to the effect of the undersampling of the @xmath45  emission by the umsb survey .",
    "the mean @xmath45  to @xmath0  ratio for molecular clumps smaller than the beam spacing of the umsb survey , @xmath135 , is @xmath136 while this ratio is @xmath137 for molecular clumps larger than @xmath135 .",
    "our excitation temperatures , and hence column densities , are therefore lower limits . because of their small size , ucs are affected more by the difference in sampling between the grs and the umsb survey .",
    "the ucs also suffer from beam dilution which will lower the inferred excitation temperature .",

    "we have removed the 6 sources with sizes greater than @xmath161 from the statistical analysis .",
    "the molecular gas around many diffuse regions is fragmented , which leads to the small angular sizes we measure .",

    "the break points where the distributions turn over from being dominated by the gaussian core to being dominated by the exponential tail are roughly 4 k and 2 @xmath78 . by number",
    "the vast majority of these grs molecular clumps have line intensities below 4 k and line widths below 2 @xmath78 .",

    "a similar plot was used by @xcite to show that the small clouds in their optically selected molecular cloud sample were cool and quiescent .",
    "the lower left quadrant in figure [ fig : t_vs_fwhm ] should be populated by cold quiescent clouds .",
    "these objects are neither making stars nor being externally heated .",
    "the upper left quadrant should contain a population of clumps that are heated externally .",
    "these clouds are warm ( or have high column densities ) , but do not have the non - thermal motions that would be present if they posessed a central star .",
    "the upper right quadrant should contain molecular gas associated with embedded massive stars .",
    "the lower right quadrant should contain embedded protostars .",
    "these large line width objects are likely active sites of star formation , or near an active site .",

    "the uc and compact nebulae occupy the same region of figure [ fig : t_vs_fwhm ] ; they have similar molecular properties .",
    "the diffuse regions , however , have lower line intensities and line widths ; they are similar to the general population of molecular clumps .",
    "these clumps are no longer being heated significantly by the ionizing star .",
    "most of our sources with associated @xmath0 , 54% , lie in the upper right quadrant of figure [ fig : t_vs_fwhm ] where large line intensities and broad line widths suggest active star formation .",
    "the vast majority of grs clumps , as well as most of the molecular clouds in @xcite , reside in the lower left quadrant .",
    "the bulk of our remaining nebulae , 42% , lie in the lower right quadrant .",
    "the uc , compact , and diffuse regions all have a significant population in this quadrant .",
    "it is tempting to think that these low line intensities are due to the decreased optical depth of @xmath0 but figure [ fig : t_vs_fwhm ] looks very similar to the same plot in @xcite made using the optically thick @xmath45 @xmath164 transition .      are these co / hii  region associations really sources that are having a direct physical interaction between the hii  region and ambient molecular gas ?",
    "the associations are based on morphological matches in position and velocity between the @xmath0  gas , rrl velocity , and radio continuum emission .",
    "but correlation does not imply causality : these matches could in principle be a coincidental juxtaposition projected on the sky into the same solid angle by molecular clouds and hiiregions located at entirely different places along the line of sight .    that we require a morphological match in @xmath110  space places a severe constraint on a false positive association .",
    "mere @xmath165 coincidence is not enough ; the velocity also needs to match .",
    "the kinematic distance ambiguity in the inner galaxy makes it possible for the hii  region and co cloud to be at different line of sight positions despite having nearly identical radial velocities .",
    "but these are special places because only they share the same lsr velocity .",
    "assessing the quantitative probability of a false positive association is beyond the scope of this paper . to our knowledge",
    "no one has yet done the detailed modelling this would require .",
    "one needs to know the galactic distribution of the clouds which posits a detailed knowledge of galactic structure . for a false positive association",
    "we require that there not be a cloud at the hii  region position , but that there be a cloud at the other kinematic distance .",
    "one thus needs to evaluate separately for each hii  region the line of sight distance derivative of the lsr velocity , @xmath166 in order to assess the path lengths at the near and far kinematic distances that must be populated .",
    "this requires a detailed knowledge of galactic kinematics , including streaming motions caused by spiral arms . with this information",
    "one might be able to estimate the probability of a false positive association .",
    "we probably do not know enough about either galactic structure or galactic kinematics to do this .",
    "the fact , however , that @xmath120 of the hii  regions do not have associated co gas (  [ sec : properties ] ) is evidence that suggests chance line of sight superpositions in @xmath167  space are rare .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : t_vs_fwhm ] provides strong support for the physical reality of our co / hii  region associations .",
    "our @xmath0clouds are not only near to the hii  regions in @xmath167  space , but their spectra also have the trademarks of star formation : bright lines and large line widths .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the spectral line properties of the vast majority of grs clouds ( see  [ sec : grs ] ) .",
    "only 1/3 of the grs clumps have peak intensities @xmath168 whereas 55% of our co / hii  associated clouds do .",
    "only 1/6 of the grs clouds have line widths @xmath169 ; nearly all of our clouds , 96% , exceed this value .",

    "our sample of co / hii  region associations will enable many further studies of the properties of star forming regions at all stages of their evolution .",

    "we found that 80% of our hii  regions showed positive molecular associations , with ucs having the highest association percentage and diffuse regions the lowest .",
    "about 5% of our sample showed no molecular emission whatsoever .",
    "we hypothesize that some of these non - detections represent an older population of hii  regions where the molecular gas has been displaced from the central star or stars .",
