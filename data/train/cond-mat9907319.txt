    "since the pioneering work by anderson@xcite , the metal - insulator transition driven by disorder , which is called the anderson transition(at ) , has attracted much attention for many years@xcite .",
    "the critical behavior of the at is conventionally classified , depending on the symmetry of hamiltonians , into three universality classes : the orthogonal , the unitary and the symplectic classes@xcite .",
    "systems invariant under spin rotation as well as time reversal form the orthogonal class .",
    "the unitary class is characterized by the absence of the time reversal symmetry .",
    "systems invariant under time reversal but having no spin rotation symmetry belong to the symplectic class .    in the last decade , there has been considerable progress in the numerical study of the at in three dimensions(3d ) by the finite - size scaling analysis for quasi-1d systems @xcite . in the early stage , it was not easy to confirm numerically for the 3d orthogonal class that the critical exponent is insensitive to the choice of the probability distribution of random potential @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy in exponents for different distributions of random potential has been removed by improving the accuracy of numerical calculations @xcite and by taking into account the corrections to scaling @xcite . with such a high - accuracy analysis , it has been concluded that the critical exponent for the orthogonal system can be distinguished from that for the unitary system@xcite .",
    "these recent developments confirm the universality of critical exponents as well as the validity of the conventional classification of universality classes in at .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in most cases , such analyses have been restricted to the at near the band center in the presence of a random scalar potential , where the scaling analysis works fairly well .",
    "in contrast , for the at away from the band center , no systematic scaling behavior has been observed@xcite .",
    "the at in a magnetic field has been studied extensively , mainly in connection with the quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "accordingly , in most cases , the magnetic field was assumed to be uniform in space and the disorder was introduced by a random scalar potential . on the other hand , in recent years , there has also been considerable interest in the transport properties of a system subject to a spatially random magnetic field .",
    "the random magnetic field introduces randomness as well as the absence of invariance under time reversal in a system .",
    "in fact , it has been shown@xcite that in 3d the at occurs in the presence of the random magnetic field and without a random scalar potential",
    ".    the at in a random magnetic field is driven by the coherent scattering due to a fluctuating vector potential .",
    "a nontrivial feature of this coherent scattering by a fluctuating vector potential has been pointed out @xcite in a theory of strongly correlated spin systems .",
    "much work has also been done on transport properties in 2d in a random magnetic field@xcite , in particular in connection with the theory of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite in a high magnetic field .",
    "it is thus an important issue to understand how the effect of coherent scattering in a strongly fluctuating random vector potential will show up in the at .",
    "the magnetic field breaks the time reversal symmetry and thus all systems in the magnetic field should belong to the unitary class .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated numerically in 3d@xcite that in the presence of a random scalar potential , the critical exponent takes a universal value , irrespective of whether the magnetic field is uniform or random .",
    "the at with a random potential and in a uniform magnetic field has been re - analyzed recently and the critical exponent for the localization length has been determined to be @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the at , in 3d , in the presence of a random vector potential and without a random scalar potential , has also been investigated based on the finite - size scaling .",
    "the data suggested @xcite that the mobility edge is very close to the band edge .",
    "the exponent for the localization length has been estimated to be @xmath3 @xcite which is considerably smaller than that in the case with an additional random scalar potential and in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "this seemed to indicate that in 3d the at driven solely by a random vector potential might exhibit critical behavior different from that observed in other unitary systems , for example systems having additional random scalar potential .",
    "apparently , this questions the validity of the conventional classification of universality classes in at . on the other hand",
    ", it should be recalled that the finite - size scaling analysis did not work for the at near the effective band edge@xcite .",
    "it is thus important to re - examine the applicability of the scaling ansatz to the at driven solely by the random magnetic field in which the mobility edge lies quite close to the band edge .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a high - precision numerical finite - size scaling analysis for the at in the random magnetic field . in order to clarify the origin of the above mentioned discrepancy between the critical exponent of the at far away from the band center induced solely by randomness in a vector potential and the exponent obtained for other unitary systems , we have considered systems both with and without an additional random potential .",
    "we also evaluate the fractal dimension of the wave functions at the critical point based on the equation - of - motion method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the hamiltonian which we adopt is introduced .",
    "the finite - size scaling study on the critical phenomena is presented in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "the fractal dimensionality of the wave function is discussed by means of the equation - of - motion method .",
    "section 5 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the creation(annihilation ) operator of an electron at the site @xmath6 of a 3d cubic lattice .",
    "energies @xmath7 denote the random scalar potential distributed independently and uniformly in the range @xmath8 $ ] . the peierls phase factors @xmath9 describe a random vector potential or magnetic field .",
    "we confine ourselves to phases @xmath10 which are distributed independently and uniformly in @xmath11 $ ] . the hopping amplitude @xmath12 is assumed to be the energy unit , @xmath13 .",
    "the phases @xmath14 are related to the magnetic flux , for example , as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the magnetic flux through the plaquette @xmath18 and the unit flux , respectively . here",
    "@xmath19 stands for the unit vector in the @xmath20-direction .",
    "note that in the present system , the condition that the magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero is satisfied .",
    "we consider quasi-1d systems with cross section @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath22 in such a bar - shaped system can be rewritten using transfer matrices @xmath23 @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the set of coefficients of the state @xmath28 and the hamiltonian of the @xmath29th slice , respectively .",
    "the identity matrix is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "the off - diagonal parts of the transfer matrix @xmath31 can be expressed by the identity matrix because the phases in the transfer - direction can be removed by a gauge transformation @xcite . the logarithms of the eigenvalues of the limiting matrix @xmath32 @xmath33^{1/2n}\\ ] ]",
    "are called the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the smallest lyapunov exponent @xmath34 along the bar is estimated by a technique which uses the product of these transfer matrices @xcite .",
    "the relative accuracies for the smallest lyapunov exponents achieved here is @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the localization length @xmath39 along the bar is given by the inverse of the smallest lyapunov exponent , @xmath40 .",
    "the assumption of one - parameter scaling for the renormalized localization length @xmath41 implies @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the relevant length scale in the limit @xmath44@xcite . near the mobility edge @xmath45",
    ", @xmath46 diverges with an exponent @xmath0 as @xmath47 with @xmath48 . if the transition is driven by the disorder @xmath49 at a constant energy , @xmath50 . at the mobility edge ,",
    "@xmath51 becomes scale - invariant .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is a smooth function of @xmath52 and @xmath49 , and we can expand it as a function of @xmath53 as @xmath54 by fitting our data to the above function , we can determine the critical exponent @xmath0 and the mobility edge accurately .",
    "in practice , we truncated the series ( [ fitcur ] ) at the third order@xmath55 and used the standard @xmath56-fitting procedure@xcite .",
    "the error bars are estimated by using the hessian matrix and the confidence interval is chosen to be @xmath57 .    for the the transition at the band center in the presence of a strong random scalar potential , a clear",
    "scaling has been observed for presently achievable sizes , @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , all the data ( 84 points ) for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 in the range @xmath61 can be successfully fitted by the fitting function ( [ fitcur ] ) up to the 3rd order , which has six fitting parameters including the critical point and the critical exponent .",
    "we have estimated the critical disorder and the exponent @xmath0 to be @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the renormalized localization length @xmath64 at the critical point is @xmath65 .",
    "the error bars of these estimations are at least a factor of 3 smaller than those of the previous estimates @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the absence of the random scalar potential ( @xmath66 ) or in the presence of an additional weak random scalar potential @xmath67 , for which the critical point lies near the band edge , we have found @xcite that the correction to scaling is not negligible . near the band edge , the density of states changes rapidly as a function of energy .",
    "we have thus performed high - accuracy transfer matrix calculations for narrower energy range @xmath68 around the critical point for @xmath66 and @xmath69 @xcite . in both cases(@xmath66 and @xmath69 ) , we have found that the estimation of the critical exponent tends to increase with the system - sizes . in order to extrapolate the critical exponent for @xmath66",
    ", we have made calculations for larger system sizes @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "here we show , in table i , the summary of the results for @xmath66 obtained by the fittings with different sizes up to @xmath71 .",
    "the relative accuracy in @xmath72 achieved for @xmath70 and @xmath71 is 1% for each sample and 7 and 5 realizations of random phases are considered , respectively .",
    "the scaling regime is assumed to be @xmath73 $ ] as in ref .",
    "it is clear that the critical point exists around @xmath74 ( see figure 1 ) . in table 1",
    ", we can see that the exponent @xmath0 tends to increase with the system - sizes and is likely to saturate around @xmath75 .",
    "within the error bars , estimated values of @xmath0 for @xmath76 are consistent with @xmath77 obtained for the band center as well as @xmath2 estimated in the uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "no evidence has been found for @xmath3 which was suggested by calculations with low accuracy @xcite .",
    "the present results support the universality of the critical exponent in the unitary systems .",
    "the positions of the critical points and the values of @xmath64 estimated with different combinations of system - sizes are fluctuating for @xmath78 ( table i ) .",
    "the value of @xmath79 at the band center seems to lie inside the range of this fluctuation .",
    "conventionally , the value of @xmath64 is also expected to be universal in unitary systems .",
    "our results obtained here seem to be consistent with this universality of @xmath64 .",
    "the mobility edge trajectory in the presence of the random magnetic field is shown in figure 2 . each critical point",
    "( mobility edge ) is estimated based on numerical data by the transfer matrix method with @xmath80 .",
    "it should be noted that there exist extended states for energies larger than the critical energy @xmath74 for @xmath66 .",
    "this type of reentrant phenomena in the energy - disorder plane has been commonly observed for systems with the uniform distribution of random scalar potential @xcite .",
    "it is interpreted @xcite that the enhancement of extended states for a weak additional random scalar potential is due to the enhancement of density of states at that energy regime .",
    "we now turn our attention to the properties of wave function just at the at in random magnetic fields .",
    "it is well known that at the at , the wave function shows multifractal structure@xcite which leads to the scale invariant behavior of conductance distributions@xcite and the energy level statistics.@xcite    the direct way to investigate the wave functions is to diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "this , however , is numerically very intensive .",
    "instead , we calculate here the time evolution of wave packets to extract the information of fractal dimension .",
    "we first prepare the initial wave packet @xmath81 close to at by diagonalizing a small cluster located at the center of the system .",
    "the time evolution of the state at time @xmath12 is then obtained by @xmath82 by the products of exponential operators as @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 are decomposition of the original hamiltonian @xmath87 which are simple enough to diagonalize analytically.@xcite    the square displacement of the wave packets is defined by @xmath88 in metallic phase , @xmath89 is proportional to @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the diffusion coefficient . in the insulating phase ,",
    "it saturates to the square of localization length , @xmath92 . at at",
    ", the anomalous diffusion@xcite @xmath93 is expected .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath94 is estimated from the autocorrelation function @xmath95 in fig .",
    "3 , we show the results of @xmath96 for the transition at the center of the band in the presence of a strong random scalar potential(@xmath97 ) . by diagonalizing a small cluster of @xmath98 located at the the center of the system , we follow the time evolution of wave packets in @xmath99 systems . geometric average of @xmath96 over 10 random field and potential configurations are performed . by fitting the data for @xmath100 , the fractal dimensionality @xmath94 is estimated to be @xmath101 considerably smaller than the space dimension @xmath102 .",
    "the above value is consistent with the estimate of 3d system at at in a strong uniform magnetic field.@xcite",
    "in summary , we have investigated in detail the at in a random magnetic field based on the transfer matrix method with considerably high accuracy . in particular , whether or not the at driven solely by the random vector potential ( @xmath66 ) exhibits different critical behavior from other unitary systems has been discussed . in order to clarify the above point , we have performed the scaling analysis for the three critical points , namely @xmath103 , @xmath66 , and @xmath69 ( figure 2 ) . for the transition at the band center ( @xmath103 ) in the presence of a strong additional random potential ,",
    "a clear scaling behavior has been observed and the exponent @xmath0 has been estimated to be @xmath1 .",
    "this coincides with the value obtained for a unitary system in a uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it has been found , on the other hand , that the correction to scaling is not negligible in the presently achievable sizes for the transitions near the band edge(@xmath69 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "the exponents estimated for @xmath66 by larger system sizes are consistent with those obtained for other unitary systems within the error bars . from the size dependence of @xmath0 , in contrast to the suggestion in ref.[ook ] , no evidence has been found for @xmath3 .",
    "these results indicate the universality of @xmath0 in the unitary class and hence support the conventional classification of the at by universality classes due to symmetry .",
    "the mobility edge trajectory has been also obtained in the presence of the random magnetic field .",
    "it s qualitative shape turns out to be similar to those obtained for other systems with the uniform distribution of random scalar potential .",
    "we have also studied the diffusion of electrons at the at in the presence of a random magnetic field . by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation numerically ,",
    "we examine the time evolution of wave packets at the at . from the asymptotic behavior of the autocorrelation function ,",
    "we have extracted the fractal dimensionality of the critical wave function at the band center .",
