    "<S> is expected and this is the case for the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , for a thermal state , the classical min - entropy always overestimate the content of true randomness . </S>",
    "<S> a thermal state is indeed mixed and it can be interpreted as @xmath3 being correlated with the environment system @xmath21 : the gap between the two entropies corresponds to the possible leakage of information due to this correlation ( cfr . </S>",

    "<S> we also note that when @xmath59 is large , the bound in eq . </S>",
    "<S> underestimates the number of true random bits extractable per measurement because the lower precision implies a looser estimation of the input state .    </S>",
    "<S> _ classical side information - _ in our sdi framework , alice controls and trust the measurement device . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that alice optimizes her hardware to not spoil the independence and uniformity of the numbers ( e.g. by oversampling the signals , by using unbalanced beam - splitters etc . ) . </S>",

    "<S> s3 . for example </S>",
    "<S> , for the vacuum input state one observes a variance of @xmath60 in all quadratures , as for a thermal state . </S>",
    "<S> because alice can not distinguish whether the input state is mixed or pure , the protocol considers the security most conservative option : any observed is treated as if it is caused by some quantum eavesdropping strategy , i.e. the system @xmath18 entangled with eve s system @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> hence any kind of side information will be erased applying quantum randomness extractors @xcite _ properly _ calibrated with the conditional min - entropy lower bound . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the check quadrature has to be measured at random instants . </S>",

    "<S> a @xmath65-bit resolution corresponds to a precision @xmath66 with @xmath67 related to the oscilloscope full - scale setting . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , for @xmath77 ( resolution of 3 bits ) @xmath78 already attains the unit value while the conditional entropy is negative . </S>",
    "<S> this is because our input state distribution is narrow with respect to the oscilloscope full - range . </S>",

    "<S> it is well known that the oscilloscope has an effective resolution lower than the nominal 8 bits , when the sampling rate is high . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we used a conservative bit depth of 5 bits satisfying the sdi requirement of having a trusted and controlled measurement apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> entropy was estimated to be @xmath87 bits in average per measurement and a corresponding rate of @xmath88 bits . </S>",
    "<S> we generated secure bits at the rate of 1.7 gbit / s .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions - _ at present time , ultimate randomness is reachable only by using device independent protocols of randomness expansion @xcite or amplification @xcite : however , such protocols are highly demanding from an experimental point of view . on the other hand , assuming the absence of local hidden variable theories , true random numbers can be obtained with approaches . </S>",

    "<S> our sdi protocol enables the ultra - fast generation of true random numbers . </S>",
    "<S> our source - device - independent approach is motivated by experimental requirements : indeed , it is typically difficult to prepare and keep a real quantum system in a pure state . we have showed that unpredictable numbers can be distilled even if the quantum eavesdropper is providing the source of quantum states .    </S>",
