    "the celebrated weyl law @xcite determines the number of quantum states in a given energy interval of conservative hamiltonian systems in a phase space dimension @xmath4 as a function of the planck constant @xmath5 @xmath6 recently this law has been generalized to the fractal weyl law applicable to open quantum systems with complex energy spectrum of nonunitary quantum operators @xcite . in this case",
    "the exponent @xmath7 is linked to the fractal dimension of invariant sets of classical non - escaping orbits .",
    "such type of operators appear in physical problems of quantum chaotic scattering , open quantum maps , metastable quantum states in molecules and nuclei .",
    "in addition to open quantum systems it has been shown that the fractal weyl law is also valid for the perron - frobenius operators of classical dynamical systems @xcite with absorption or dissipation @xcite .",
    "a finite size matrix approximant @xmath8 of such operators is efficiently constructed using the ulam method @xcite which divides the whole phase space on @xmath9 cells of size @xmath10 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath11 of the ulam matrix approximant @xmath8 of the perron - frobenius operator are located in a complex plane of a circle with @xmath12 . for two - dimensional ( 2d ) maps we have the matrix size @xmath13 so that a cell area @xmath14 effectively plays a role of @xmath5 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a number of eigenvalues @xmath11 with @xmath17 . for dynamical strange attractors and 2d maps with absorption",
    "we have @xmath18 where @xmath4 is a fractal dimension of a dynamical invariant set , e.g. a fractal dimension of a strange attractor @xcite . for @xmath19 the majority of eigenvalues",
    "have @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "in fact the ulam method applied to 1d and 2d maps naturally generates the ulam networks @xcite which properties can be rather similar to the properties of scale - free directed networks such as the world wide web ( www ) .",
    "such type of networks naturally appear in various fields of science ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we can expect that the fractal weyl law can appear also for directed networks similar to those of the www .",
    "the properties of such networks are well characterized by the google matrix @xmath22 @xcite constructed on the basis of directed links between nodes : @xmath23 where the matrix @xmath8 is obtained by normalizing to unity all columns of the adjacency matrix , and replacing columns with zero elements by @xmath24 , @xmath9 being the network size @xcite . in the www context , the damping parameter @xmath25 describes the probability to jump to any node for a random surfer .",
    "for @xmath26 the only eigenvector with @xmath27 is the pagerank vector which has non - negative components and plays an important role in ranking of the www sites @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 belongs to the class of perron - frobenius operators @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath22 for the www university networks was studied recently in @xcite and it was shown that a significant fraction of eigenvalues is concentrated at @xmath20 that is a characteristic property of spectra with the weyl law .",
    "however , no direct evidence for the fractal weyl law for the www was found there for the reasons we explain below .     in the complex plane for the google matrix @xmath22 of the linux kernel versions @xmath28 ( top left panel ) , @xmath29 ( top right panel ) and @xmath30 ( left bottom panel ) with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",

    "thus it was shown that the fractal dimension of networks of www and actors is @xmath35 respectively @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the origin of fractal architecture of network is linked to a strong effective repulsion between the most connected nodes @xcite .",
    "such a generic fractal structure of complex networks also indicates that under certain conditions the fractal weyl law can appear in the spectrum of the google matrix of such networks .",
    "however , it is also important to note that usually the fractal properties are investigated for undirected networks or by converting directed networks into undirected ones ( see e.g. @xcite ) . here , on a concrete example of the linux kernel network",
    "we show that the directionality of the network places a crucial role so that the directed network has different fractal dimension compared to the converted undirected network with the same nodes .",
    "the importance of directionality is very clear from the spectrum of the google matrix : the spectrum is in a complex plane for a directed network while for an undirected network the spectrum is on a real line .",
    "the paper is composed as following : the specrum of the google matrix is analyzed in section ii , the fractal properties of the linux kernel network are considered in section iii , the properties of google matrix eigenstates are studied in section iv and discussion of the results is given in section v.",
    "to check the validity of the fractal weyl law for a certain type of scale - free networks we focus on the procedure call network ( pcn ) of the linux kernel software introduced and studied recently in @xcite . in the pcn",
    "the directed links are formed by the calls between procedures and the google matrix ( [ eq2 ] ) is constructed in the same way as for the www .",
    "the results of @xcite show that only about @xmath36 of eigenvalues have @xmath37 that is by a factor 50 smaller compared to the university networks of similar size studied in @xcite .",
    "this gives a significant indication on appearance of the fractal weyl law in the pcn . to study the spectral properties of @xmath22 we use the data for the google matrix at @xmath38 obtained in @xcite .",
    "our results are not sensitive to @xmath25 which affects the spectrum of @xmath22 in a rather simple way @xcite .     on the relaxation rate @xmath39 for the google matrix of different versions of linux kernels from @xmath40 with @xmath31 to @xmath30 with @xmath33 as it is shown on the legend .",

    "the values of @xmath9 correspond ( in increasing order ) to linux kernel versions @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "@xmath9 we used the arnoldi method from arpack library @xcite that allowed to find all eigenvalues with @xmath63 up to the maximum @xmath33 .",

    "the later are related to certain cycles in procedure calls , e.g. an eigenstate at @xmath66 is located only on 6 nodes . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we also present the spectrum of the google matrix @xmath34 which is obtained by an inversion of link directions in the adjacency matrix of the pcn as it was proposed in @xcite .",

[ fig3 ] respectively . ]    the network size @xmath9 grows with the version number of linux kernel corresponding to its evolution in time .",
    "the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath9 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , clearly demonstrates the validity of the fractal weyl law with the exponent @xmath81 for @xmath22 ( we find @xmath82 for @xmath34 ) . we take the values of @xmath7 for @xmath72 where the number of eigenvalues @xmath16 gives a better statistics .",
    "withing statistical errors the value of @xmath7 is not sensitive to the cutoff value at small @xmath74 .",

    "these results show that the pcn of linux kernel has a fractal dimension @xmath83 for @xmath22 and @xmath84 for @xmath34 .",
    "to check that the fractal dimension of the pcn indeed has this value we compute the dimension of the network by another direct method known as the cluster growing method ( a description of this method can be find in @xcite ) . in this method the average mass or number of nodes @xmath85",

    "@xmath4 the mass @xmath85 should grow as @xmath86 that allows to determine the value of @xmath4 for a given network .",
    "it is important to note that up to now the cluster growing method ( see e.g. @xcite ) was used only for undirected networks .",
    "our network is a directed one and , since we did not find relevant methods for such a case in a literature , we generalized this method in a simple way using the network distance @xmath76 following only outgoing links .",

    "global averaging the method gives the same result for the matrix with inverted link direction ( indeed , the total number of outgoing links is equal to the number of ingoing links ) .",

    "the participation ratio @xmath90 of eigenstates is shown as a function of modulus of the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath91 ; the values of @xmath92 , averaged over all given interval of @xmath91 , are @xmath93 respectively . ]",
    "the dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath76 , obtained for the directed network , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . up to a saturation regime related to a finite number of nodes the growth of @xmath85",
    "is satisfactory described by a power law with a certain fractal dimension @xmath4 .",
    "the straight lines , with the value of @xmath4 obtained from the fractal weyl law , give in average a satisfactory description of the growth @xmath94 .",
    "more detailed data , with the fitted values of @xmath4 for the interval @xmath77 , are shown in the inset panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for various network sizes @xmath9 . for linux versions up to v2.3",
    "the fractal dimension remains in the interval @xmath95 with an average @xmath2 .",
    "however , we have @xmath96 for v2.4 and @xmath97 for v2.6 versions .",
    "we attribute the strong deviation for the version v2.6 to the well known fact that significant rearrangements in the linux kernel have been done after version v2.4 @xcite .",
    "also the data of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] clearly show the saturation of @xmath94 at relatively small values @xmath98 compared to the whole size of the network @xmath99 .",
    "this happens due to existence of many isolated communities in the network which become linked only due to regularization of the google matrix ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this is the reason of strong degeneracy of the eigenvalue @xmath75 which has @xmath100 values for the version v2.6 .",
    "also , in contrast to undirected networks , in directed networks there are nodes with only ingoing links that give an important reduction of the average mass .",
    "thus in view of the above restrictions we consider that there is a rather good agreement of the fractal dimension obtained from the fractal weyl law with @xmath1 and the value obtained with the cluster growing method which gives an average @xmath2 . the fact that @xmath4 is approximately the same for all versions up to v2.4 means that the linux kernel is characterized by a self - similar fractal growth in time .",
    "the closeness of @xmath4 to unity signifies that procedure calls are almost linearly ordered that corresponds to a good code organization .",
    "of course , the fractal weyl law gives the dimension @xmath4 obtained during time evolution of the network .",
    "this dimension is not necessary the same as for a given version of the network of fixed size .",
    "however , one can expect that the growth goes in a self - similar way @xcite and that static dimension is close to the dimension value emerging during the time evolution .",
    "this can be viewed as a some kind of ergodicity conjecture .",
    "our data show that this conjecture works with a good accuracy up to the linux kernel v.2.6 .    here",
    "it is important to note that the properties of the directed network are very different from the converted undirected network with the same nodes .",
    "the later is obtained from the directed network by replacing all directed links by undirected ones .",
    "the results obtained by the clustering growing method for this undirected network are shown in fig .",
    "we find that it is difficult to fit the dependence @xmath101 by a simple power law in this case .",
    "a very rough estimate gives very high value @xmath102 being by a factor 4 larger than the dimension of the directed network .",
    "also the saturation level of @xmath103 is now comparable with the whole system size @xmath9 while for the directed network it is smaller than @xmath9 by three orders of magnitude .",
    "usually the methods of computation of fractal dimension have been developed for undirected networks ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our example shows that the directed networks may have rather different characteristics compared to their undirected versions .",
    "thus new methods for computation of fractal dimension in directed networks should be developed .",
    "our results show that the generalized version of the method described in @xcite work well in the case of directed networks .     for the eigenstates of the google matrix for linux kernel version @xmath30 .",

    "it is defined as @xmath114 .",
    "physically , @xmath115 gives the number of nodes effectively occupied by an eigenstate @xmath61 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath91 for three versions of the linux kernel is shown in fig .",
    "there is only a small increase of @xmath90 with size @xmath9 which is however much smaller than the increase of @xmath9 from one version to another .",
    "also even maximum values of @xmath90 remain by a factor @xmath116 smaller than the system size @xmath9 .",
    "thus we conclude that the eigenstates are essentially localized .",

    "the main peaks of probability are scattered over the whole system size @xmath9 .",
    "the appearance of vertical stripes is clearly visible .",
    "this signifies that statistically the positions of peaks are repeated from one eigenstate to another .",
    "it is possible that this effect is related with certain cycles between procedures in the linux kernel .",
    "these cycles , or communities as it is used to say for the www , appear even on a far tail of the pagerank .",
    "the origin of such weakly isolated cycles and correlations between different relaxation modes requires further detailed studies .",
    "here we characterized the directed network by the google matrix and investigated its spectrum and eigenstate properties .",
    "we think that such an approach gives much richer charcteristization of networks .",
    "indeed , as it was shown in @xcite , the spectrum of the google matrix depends in a sensible way on network structure so that networks with rather similar distribution of links may have very drastic differences in the spectrum ( e.g. presence or absence of gap in a vicinity of @xmath27 ) .",
    "we think that further studies of the goggle matrix properties of complex networks will bring us deeper understanding of their generic properties . in conclusion ,",
    "our results show that the google matrix of the pcn of the linux kernel is characterized by the fractal weyl law with the fractal weyl exponent @xmath0 .",
    "this value corresponds to the fractal dimension of the network @xmath1 .",
    "this dimension is smaller than two and thus the fractal weyl law becomes well visible .",
    "in contrast to that for networks with the dimension @xmath117 the fractal weyl law is replaced by a usual dependence @xmath118 since @xmath119 .",
    "it is known that the www has the fractal dimension @xmath120 @xcite that explains why the fractal weyl law does not work for the www university networks discussed in @xcite .",
    "on the basis of our result we argue that the fractal weyl law should appear in all directed networks with the fractal dimension @xmath121 .",
    "it is important to note that the fractal weyl exponent @xmath7 is not sensitive to the exponent characterizing the decay of the pagerank : indeed , according to @xcite the later remains the same for the www and the pcn of linux kernel while the values of @xmath7 are different .",
    "we think that the further studies of the fractal weyl law for directed networks with @xmath3 will bring us to a deeper understanding of their scale - free properties .",
    "our results also show that the properties of directed networks can be rather different from their undirected versions .",
