    "since the famous cat paradox was formulated by schrdinger @xcite , the question whether the range of validity of quantum mechanics in principle extends to macroscopic objects has been a long - standing open problem .",
    "while macroscopic quantum tunneling was observed in several experiments @xcite , there is less experimental evidence for macroscopic quantum coherence .",
    "the experimental study of macroscopic superconducting circuits comprising low - capacitance josephson junctions as a physical implementation of a quantum computer ( see ref .   for a review ) represents a new test for macroscopic quantum coherence . on the theory side ,",
    "the effect of dissipation on macroscopic quantum tunneling and macroscopic quantum coherence was put into a quantitative phenomenological model by caldeira and leggett @xcite .",
    "the fundamental building block of a quantum computer @xcite is the quantum bit ( qubit)a quantum mechanical two - state system that can be initialized , controlled , coupled to other qubits , and read out at the end of a quantum computation .",
    "presently , three prototypes of superconducting qubits are studied experimentally .",
    "the charge ( @xmath2 ) and the flux ( @xmath3 ) qubits are distinguished by their josephson junctions relative magnitude of charging energy @xmath4 and josephson energy @xmath5 .",
    "a third type , the phase qubit @xcite , operates in the same regime as the flux qubit , but it consists of a single josephson junction . in all of these systems ,",
    "the quantum state of the superconducting phase differences across the josephson junctions in the circuit contain the quantum information , i.e. , the state of the qubit .",
    "since the superconducting phase is a continuous variable as , e.g. , the position of a particle , superconducting qubits ( two - level systems ) have to be obtained by truncation of an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this truncation is only approximate for various reasons ; ( i ) because it may not be possible to prepare the initial state with perfect fidelity in the lowest two states , ( ii ) because of erroneous transitions to higher levels ( leakage effects ) due to imperfect gate operations on the system , and ( iii ) because of erroneous transitions to higher levels due to the unavoidable interaction of the system with the environment .",
    "one result of the present work is a quantitative estimate of the effect of errors of type ( iii ) by studying the _ multi - level _ dynamics of a superconducting circuit containing dissipative elements .",
    "the multilevel dynamics and leakage in superconducting qubits may be related to the observed limited visibility of coherent oscillations .",
    "previous theoretical works on the decoherence of superconducting qubits @xcite have typically relied on the widely used spin - boson model that _ postulates _ a purely two - level dynamics , therefore neglecting leakage effects .",
    "ref .   includes the dynamics of an attached measurement device , thus going beyond the standard spin - boson model while still making the _ a priori _ two - level assumption .    in this paper",
    ", we present a general multi - level quantum theory of decoherence in macroscopic superconducting circuits and apply it to circuits designed to represent flux qubits , i.e.  in the regime @xmath3 .",
    "however , the same formalism can be applied to charge qubits .",
    "flux qubits have been proposed and studied experimentally by several groups @xcite .",
    "the first step in our analysis is the derivation of a lagrangian and hamiltonian from the classical dynamics of a superconducting circuit ; the hamiltonian is then used as the basis of our quantum theory of the superconducting circuit . while deriving the lagrangian and hamiltonian of a dissipation - free electrical circuit",
    "is  at least in principle  rather straightforward , different possible representations of dissipative elements ( such as resistors ) can be found in the literature .",
    "one possibility is the representation of resistors as transmission lines @xcite , i.e.  an infinite set of dissipation - free elements ( capacitors and inductors ) . here",
    ", we use a related but different approach following caldeira and leggett by modeling each resistive element by a bath of harmonic oscillators that are coupled to the degrees of freedom of the circuit @xcite ( see also refs .   for extensive reviews ) .",
    "we develop a general method for deriving a hamiltonian for an electrical circuit containing josephson junctions using network graph theory @xcite .",
    "a similar approach , combining network graph theory with the caldeira - leggett model for dissipative elements , was proposed by devoret @xcite . on a more microscopic level ,",
    "circuit theory was also used in combination with keldysh green functions in order to obtain the full counting statistics of electron transport in mesoscopic systems @xcite . here , we give explicit general expressions for the hamiltonian in terms of the network graph parameters of the circuit .",
    "we apply our theory to josephson junction networks that are currently under study as possible candidates for superconducting realizations of quantum bits . by tracing out the degrees of freedom of the dissipative elements ( e.g. , resistors ) ,",
    "we derive a generalized master equation for the superconducting phases . in the born - markov approximation",
    ", the master equation is cast into the particularly useful form of the bloch - redfield equations @xcite .",
    "since we do not start from a spin - boson model , we can describe multi - level dynamics and thus leakage , i.e.  transitions from the allowed qubit states to higher excited states of the superconducting system . as a special case",
    ", we truncate the hilbert space and derive a two - level ( bloch ) theory with characteristic relaxation ( @xmath0 ) and decoherence ( @xmath1 ) times .",
    "before presenting a formal derivation , we explain the main results and show how they can be applied to calculate the relaxation , decoherence , and leakage times @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath6 of a superconducting qubit .",
    "our theory is capable of predicting more than these quantities since it can be used to model the evolution of the entire density matrix .",
    "however , we concentrate on the relaxation , decoherence , and leakage time in order to keep the discussion simple . for concreteness , we discuss the ibm qubit @xcite , which is described by the electrical circuit drawn in fig .",

    "the procedure is as follows .    1 .",
    "draw and label a _ network graph _ of the superconducting circuit , in which each two - terminal element ( josephson junction , capacitor , inductor , external impedance , current source ) is represented as a branch connecting two nodes . in fig .",

    "[ ibm - graph ] and [ rsj ] , the direction of branches is represented by an arrow .",
    "2 .   find a _ tree _ of the network graph .",
