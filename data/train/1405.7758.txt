    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that although holm  15a is the largest cusp - bcg , it nevertheless lies less than @xmath78 above the correlation between @xmath31 and luminosity ( as does a2261-bcg ) .",
    "this might suggest that a common mechanism is responsible for the formation of cores over a wide range of scales .",

    "a2261-bcg is devoid of emission lines ( pl12 ) .",
    "low emission from molecular gas @xcite and dust @xcite suggests that there is little star formation in holm  15a .",
    "indeed , the radio power of holm  15a (  2.2 ) , being larger than @xmath79 , can not be explained by star formation alone @xcite .",
    "hence , we conclude that optical line emission and radio continuum are dominated by agn activity .",
    "a2261-bcg is a radio - agn , it is slightly more luminous than holm  15a ( @xmath80 , pl12 )    using known scaling relations we formed the five smbh mass estimates given in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "three scaling relations suggest bh masses @xmath83 , but these relations have large scatter and were derived with limited samples .",
    "therefore , we conservatively suggest that holm  15a hosts an smbh with @xmath84 .",
    "an smbh has a strong stellar - dynamical influence within radius @xmath85 .",
    "if we adopt @xmath86 and velocity dispersion @xmath87 , @xmath88 . thus only with the largest mass estimate from table  [ tbl-3 ] can we interpret the cusp radius as due to the gravitational influence of an smbh causing @xmath89 .",
    "let s suppose that holm  15a contains an smbh binary with total mass @xmath90 , then we would expect the separation between the smbh components to be @xmath91 @xcite . for an smbh binary total mass @xmath92 this implies @xmath93 , which is close to the average cusp scale of bcgs , but much less than the scale of holm  15a .",
    "the morphology of the radio emission in holm  15a is not clear in current data , since most of the flux density is in rather diffuse structure , which could be much distorted . if this is the case , then by analogy with rbs  797 @xcite , a high - sensitivity , high - resolution , map of the center of holm  15a could test whether holm  15a hosts an smbh binary .",
    "j004150 appears to be at far higher redshift than holm  15a .",
    "however , if the light of holm  15a was not properly modeled , the photometric redshift estimated for j004150 could be in error . moreover , if j004150 is a quasar at @xmath94 , then extended x - ray emission from the hot interstellar medium is unlikely to have been detected in the current _ chandra _ exposure . instead , the apparent x - ray extension is more consistent with a low-@xmath95 agn .",
    "it is possible that j004150 is a third smbh component associated with holm  15a .",
    "this can be tested by optical spectroscopy of j004150 .",
    "we follow @xcite to estimate the mass of the smbh associated to the cluster dark matter halo .",

    "holm  15a is the central galaxy of abell  85 , and three of the mass estimates in table  [ tbl-3 ] are consistent with the expected cluster central smbh mass .",
    "such agreement is unexpected unless dark matter halos are scale - free , and the smbh - dark matter coevolution is independent from the effects of baryons ( cf .",
    "otherwise , we should accept that ultramassive ( @xmath98 ) bh in bcg follow special scalings as suggested by @xcite , and that the masses of smbh can not grow indefinitely @xcite .",
    "we have found that holm  15a has the largest core known so far , with @xmath99 .",
    "a central agn supports the presence of a central bh , which could be ultramassive .",
    "very large cores ( @xmath100 ) seem to be rare ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) and may represent a relatively brief phase in the evolution of bcg , as calculated merging times for smbh binaries appear to be relatively short @xcite",
    ". other mechanisms might be at work , because time scales for cusp regeneration seem too long ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . if smbh growth is regulated by galaxy mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
