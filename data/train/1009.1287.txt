    "since the cooling time of gas in many cluster cores is much less than the hubble time , energy must be occasionally or continuously supplied to cluster cores to prevent the formation of cooling flows . a primary candidate for the suppression of cluster cooling flows",

    "this strongly suggests that the jet power and the interaction between jets and the hot gas in their vicinity play pivotal roles in governing the overall morphology ( fri vs. frii ) of the radio source .",
    "the radio source 3c288 is identified with an elliptical galaxy with @xmath7 = 18.3 ( @xmath8 = @xmath922.08 , * ? ? ?",
    "it is the archetypal example of a transitional fri / frii ( ` jetted double ' ) radio galaxy @xcite . in optical imaging , there are fainter galaxies in the field which are presumed to be members of a cluster that is dominated by 3c288 @xcite .",
    "dominant cluster members can produce asymmetric `` wide - angle - tail '' ( wat ) radio structures @xcite , despite their presumed low peculiar velocities , but 3c288 is not a clear example of wat morphology .",

    ", we would like to measure the deprojected temperature profile across the jumps ; however , the limited number of photons simply does not permit this , although the lack of temperature variation suggests that projection effects are probably not large . instead ,",
    "we used the extracted spectra from two large regions for each front for the subsequent analysis ; one for the bright side of the front ( inside or post - shock ) and one for the faint side of the front ( outside or pre - shock ) . for the east jump ,",

    "these uncertainties are at 90% confidence .",
    "there are at least two possible explanations for the surface brightness discontinuities : they could be shocks in the gas due to the supersonic inflation of the radio lobes , or they could be contact discontinuities created by non - hydrostatic motions of the gas core due to a recent merger ( i.e. ` sloshing ' ) .",
    "unfortunately the quality of the data is not sufficient for us to make a definitive statement about whether these discontinuities are shocks or sloshing .",
    "the temperature of the cluster is sufficiently hot ( @xmath13 kev ) that the cluster temperature is not well constrained with less than several thousand counts per spectrum .",
    "we favor the shock model , as described below , but arguments can be made for either scenario .",
    "we describe some of the implications of both models .",
    "note that our conclusions about the overall energetics of the radio galaxy are not significantly different under the two scenarios .",
    "more explicitly , the estimate energy of the outburst is only tens of percent larger for the shock scenario than the subsonic inflation scenario .",
    "several lines of evidence suggest that the discontinuities are shocks , including the relative symmetry of the discontinuities around the nucleus which are not typically seen in sloshing cores , the lack of cool gas in the cluster core , the lack of any evidence of a recent merger in the _ hst _ image of the host galaxy @xcite , the lack of any evidence of merging on larger scales , and the transformational morphology of the radio source from frii to fri suggesting that it is strongly interacting with its environment .",
    "if these features are shocks , we can estimate the expansion velocity of the radio lobes , total power of the outburst , etc . to constrain the impact the effect of this outburst",
    "would have on the surrounding gas .",
    "these conclusions could be definitively confirmed ( or refuted ) with a deeper _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "we use the example of m87 to provide a nearby analogy to interpret the features seen in the 3c288 cluster gas .",
    "m87 is the dominant central galaxy in the virgo cluster showing remarkable morphological details in both the x - ray and the radio @xcite .",
    "radio observations show evidence of two distinct nuclear outbursts , and x - ray observations show at least two sets of surface brightness discontinuities in the gas indicative of shocks @xcite .",
    "3c288 shows a signature of a shock , two regions of enhanced pressure , at a radius of 53.3 kpc on the east and 91.1 kpc on the south - west , similar to m87 .",
    "if these features are indeed shocks , the post - shock gas temperature and density will be higher than the pre - shock values in a narrow region behind the shock . with the existing data , we can not determine the gas temperature profiles across the discontinuities with sufficient accuracy to confirm that they are shocks .",

    "we predict temperature jumps @xmath38",
    "@xmath32 1.32@xmath39 and 1.52@xmath40 , respectively for the east and south - west wedges , which are consistent , within error  bars , with our measured temperatures .",
    "the pressure is discontinuous at the shock front as shown in figures  [ de_proj_e ] and  [ de_proj_sw ] , panel ( d ) for the east and southwest shocks , respectively .      `",
    "sloshing ' of the dense cluster gas core is the term used to describe the non - hydrostatic gas motions induced by a recent merger . when a cluster undergoes a perturbation to its gravitational potential caused by another infalling group or cluster , the gas core lags behind the cluster the potential minimum , as they both move toward the perturbing object . as the gas core falls back onto the potential minimum , it overshoots it and begins to oscillate .",
    "with each oscillation , the gas core is moving against its own trailing gas , producing an  edge \" in the x - ray brightness which expands out from the cluster .",
    "this sequence of events is described in more detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the continued oscillation of the core gas about the potential minimum produces a succession of radially propagating cold fronts , manifested as concentric edges in the surface brightness distribution .",
    "these fronts may form a spiral structure when the sloshing direction is near the plane of the sky and the merger has a non - zero angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the observational features of a cold front are a large temperature jump across the discontinuity ( the colder gas is closer to the nucleus ) with no discontinuity in pressure .",
    "the gas density , and therefore surface brightness , also generally forms a spiral pattern .",
    "if we assume that the pressure is continuous across the discontinuity , the temperature jumps should be by factors of 0.67@xmath41 and 0.57@xmath42 respectively , based on the derived density jumps for the eastern and the south - western surface brightness discontinuity .",
    "these jumps are well within the uncertainties shown in figures  [ de_proj_e ] and  [ de_proj_sw ] .",
    "if we assume that we are viewing an advanced stage of gas sloshing , the two discontinuities possibly form a clockwise spiral pattern around the core of the cluster because the south - western discontinuity is father than the eastern discontinuity from the core . in",
    "much better exposed chandra observations of ` sloshing ' , however , the discontinuity is most prominent in one small sector , not equally visible in two nearly opposite directions @xcite    to our knowledge , there has been no comprehensive study of individual galaxies of this cluster or measurement of their velocity dispersion . the nearest galaxy to the cluster center detected in the sloan survey , sdss  j133850.88@xmath43385216.0 ( @xmath0 = 0.2442 ) , at a projected distance of @xmath10.3  mpc ( 1.131@xmath44 ) ( sdss dr7 ; * ?",
    "* ) , has no gas associated with it in the _ chandra _ image .",
    "additionally , there is no clear pattern of spiral structure in the core , only an offset in the positions of the discontinuities .",
    "however , the relatively low quality of the data makes a quantitative statement impossible .",
    "we conclude that the only compelling argument to support the sloshing hypothesis is the vague similarity of the discontinuities seen in 3c 288 with other ` sloshing ' systems , and as described above there are several lines of evidence to suggest they are shocks .",
    "a much deeper chandra observation and/or a systematic study of the member galaxies of this cluster would provide a definitive answer .",
    "if the surface brightness discontinuities in 3c288 are shocks , we can estimate ( i ) the total energy and the age of the outburst , ( ii ) the amount of mass accreted by the central smbh , and ( iii ) make a strong statement about the effects of outbursts on suppression of the formation of large amounts of cool gas .",
    "the total thermal energy of the gas within the core radius of the beta - model is @xmath12.0 @xmath2 10@xmath5 ergs .",
    "this approach underestimates the true energy because the shock front extends considerably further to the east and southwest , implying a faster , stronger shock , encompassing a greater volume in those directions .",
    "however the value of 2.0 @xmath2 10@xmath5 ergs provides a conservative estimate of the thermal energy of the gas .",
    "we estimate the mechanical energy of the outburst by two methods .",
    "first , assuming that the bubbles inflated adiabatically , the total bubble enthalpy is @xmath19.0 @xmath2 10@xmath45 ergs .",
    "only 25% of this ( @xmath12.3@xmath210@xmath45 ergs ) has gone to heat the gas .",
    "we have assumed an enthalpy of @xmath46 for each lobe ( i.e. @xmath47=4/3 ) , and that the lobes can be modeled as cylinders in the plane of the sky @xcite .",
    "this is the minimum energy of inflation .",
    "if the inflation were in fact supersonic , the energy imparted to the gas could be considerably larger .",
    "the minimum mean mechanical power of the jet is then p@xmath48 = 6.1 @xmath2 10@xmath49 ergs  s@xmath4 , if we assume the bubbles are buoyantly evolving with a mean speed of 0.5@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we next compute the energy of the outburst assuming that the shock is caused by an isotropic point explosion .",
    "we model the shock as a one - dimensional point release of energy into a @xmath50-model atmosphere .",
    "the parameters of the model , including the energy and age of the burst , are adjusted to fit the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "this model has been used to constrain the shock parameters for ngc 4636 and other nuclear outbursts @xcite .",
    "first , for the eastern shock , we fit the shock model to the surface brightness profile , finding that the shock energy is 4.7 @xmath2 10@xmath45 ergs and the shock age is @xmath13 @xmath2 10@xmath51 yr .",
    "the latter is better determined , since it depends largely on the shock radius and its current speed .",
    "second , for the south - west shock , a similar analysis yields a shock energy of 7.7 @xmath2 10@xmath45 ergs and shock age of @xmath14 @xmath2 10@xmath51 yr .",
    "the two ages are fairly similar and this suggests that there is some asymmetry in the pressure profile .",
    "it is conceivable that the shocks arise from two different outbursts",
    ". if the shocks are part of a front produced by a single outburst , the total energy would lie ( roughly ) between these two values , or @xmath16.2@xmath210@xmath45 ergs , and similarly the shock age would be @xmath13.5 @xmath2 10@xmath51 yr .",
    "the mass of the central smbh can be estimated from the k - z data for the 3crr sample @xcite and is @xmath14.0 @xmath52 m@xmath53 @xcite . assuming the outburst was powered by the gravitational binding energy released by accretion , and adopting a mass - energy conversion efficiency @xmath54 and a total outburst energy of between @xmath10.9@xmath210@xmath5  ergs (= @xmath46 ) and 1.3 @xmath2 10@xmath5  ergs (= @xmath55 @xmath43 shock - outburst - energy )",
    ", we find that under these assumptions the black hole grew by @xmath56 here , @xmath57 accounts for the lost binding energy , @xmath58 is the total energy output in mechanical and radiative forms .",
    "we ignore the radiation because it accounts for a negligible fraction of the current power output .",
    "this growth in mass corresponds to an average growth rate of @xmath59 over the past @xmath1@xmath60 .",
    "thus the current outburst is a small ( @xmath611% ) contribution to the mass of the central smbh .    can bondi accretion of the icm account for the mechanical power of the outburst @xcite ?",
    "it is in principle straightforward to regulate in the context of feedback models and cooling flows @xcite and the x - ray atmosphere provides a steady supply of fuel . in relatively low power radio galaxies hosted by giant ellipticals , bondi accretion has been shown to be energetically feasible in the sense that hot atmospheres probably have a sufficient gas density to supply the mass required to account for the observed jet powers @xcite .    the average gas density and temperature in the inner 3.2@xmath13 ( 12 kpc ) of 3c288 s hot halo is n@xmath62 = 2.3 @xmath2 10@xmath63 @xmath64 and 2.9@xmath65  kev , respectively . using the black hole mass of @xmath66 = 4.0 @xmath2 10@xmath67  m@xmath68 ( see above ) , we find a bondi accretion rate of @xmath69 @xmath70",
    "this value lies roughly an order of magnitude below the @xmath71 required to power the current outburst and taken at face value suggests that the current outburst can not be powered by bondi accretion of hot cluster medium .",
    "we caution however that this result relies on an extrapolation of the temperature and density profile into the core .",
    "_ chandra _ s resolution is not sufficient to probe the gas on scales of kiloparsec , and even a modest increase in density and decrease in temperature of the gas on these spatial scales could easily balance the bondi accretion rate with the mechanical power of the outburst .",
    "for example , the gas in the bcgs of hot , non - cool core clusters such as coma is denser and cooler than that of the ambient icm @xcite .",
    "the fact that the shock is detached from the lobes , that no x - ray emission is detectable from the central agn , and that the radio galaxy may be transitioning from frii to fri all support the idea that inflation of the lobes has slowed perhaps due to the energy supply to the jet being greatly reduced or cut off .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that energy released due to the bondi accretion is currently far less than the mechanical power of the outburst , if the agn power has recently dropped significantly .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the current outburst was fueled by accretion of cold gas from , for example , a dusty disk .",
    "such accretion is commonly seen in nearby friis such as 3c33 @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence of a dusty disk in the _ hst _ image @xcite , so it is not clear where this cold gas would originate .",
    "hence , in short , it is plausible for the bondi accretion to power the current outburst and cold gas could come from a minor merger , but the existing data is of insufficient quality to make a definitive statement .",
    "the estimated energy of the shock is roughly twice the value of the minimum @xmath72 work done by the inflation of the lobes , thus demonstrating that supersonic inflation of the lobes can play a key role in the energy balance of cool core clusters .",
    "the shock energy is also a significant fraction ( @xmath130% ) of the total thermal energy of the gas within the radius of the shock .",
    "this possibly suggests that the temperature and thermal energy of the gas in the core prior to the inflation of the radio lobes was at least 30% lower . we conclude that we are most likely witnessing agn feedback in action , and that the outburst , which may have been fueled by bondi accretion of cooling gas at the cluster center , has likely puffed up the cluster cool core to offset radiative losses .      finally , we use the measured pressure profile of the gas to determine whether the lobes are at or near equipartition . to estimate the equipartition magnetic field strength , @xmath73 ,",
    "in the lobes , we make the conventional assumptions that all relevant features are cylinders with depths equal to their radius on the plane of the sky , that the radio spectra are power laws from 10  mhz to 100 ghz , that the filling factor of the emission is unity , and that equal energies reside in the heavy particles and the relativistic electrons . with these assumptions",
    ", @xmath73 is @xmath150  @xmath74 g over the lobes , consistent with @xcite , and hence , the equipartition pressure is @xmath17.7 @xmath2 10@xmath75 dyn  @xmath16 . using the best - fit models of the @xmath50 profile",
    ", we estimate the thermal gas pressure at the approximate position of the lobes to be @xmath11.1 @xmath2 10@xmath76 dyn  @xmath16 .",
    "thus for the case of this fri / frii transitional object , the equipartition pressure of the lobe is roughly equal to that of the ambient pressure given the uncertainties of roughly 50% .",
    "the result does not change even if we assume that lobes of 3c288 do not contain an energetically dominant proton population .",
    "this suggests that this ` transitional ' object is , at least in this regard , more similar to the frii radio galaxies than the fris .",
    "it is typically found that the equipartition pressures of lobes in fri radio galaxies are orders of magnitude less than the ambient gas , while the @xmath77 for friis @xcite .",
    "3c288 and its gaseous environment provide a laboratory at moderate redshift for investigating the interaction between an outburst from a smbh and the surrounding cluster medium . using the 42  ks _ chandra _ observations of 3c288",
    ", we deduce the following :    1 .",

    "the data are not of sufficient quality to detect the expected jump in temperature at the discontinuity ( t@xmath80/t@xmath81 ) .",

    "<S> we argue therefore that the discontinuities are shocks due to the supersonic inflation of the radio lobes . if they are shocks , the energy of the outburst is @xmath110@xmath5 ergs , or roughly 30% of the thermal energy of the gas within the radius of the shock , assuming that the shocks are part of a front produced by a single outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling time of the gas is @xmath110@xmath6 yrs , so that the energy deposited by the nuclear outburst could have reheated and efficiently disrupted a cool core . </S>"
