    "one of the most exciting possibilities opened by research on cold atoms in optical traps is to study in a controlled manner model hamiltonians of interest to condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , high on the list of questions that can in principle be answered by these model systems is whether high - temperature superconductivity can be explained by the two - dimensional hubbard model away from half - filling .",
    "jaksch:2004,hofstetter:2002 as a first step towards achieving this goal , the antiferromagnetic phase expected at half - filling offers an easier target state that occurs at higher temperature in the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite    in optical lattices , the two spin species occurring in the hubbard model are mimicked by atoms in two different hyperfine states . the cooling of these atomic gases necessary to observe ordered states has been discussed before .",
    "@xcite it has been recently pointed out however that there is an additional mechanism , @xcite akin to pomeranchuck cooling in liquid helium 3 , that is available to help in achieving the temperatures where antiferromagnetism can be observed . in this mechanism , the temperature can be lowered by turning on at constant entropy what amounts to interactions in the hubbard model ( see ref .",
    "( ) for a review ) .",
    "the original calculations for this effect were done for the hubbard model using dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) . @xcite while it is expected that this approach will give qualitatively correct results , accurate predictions are necessary to achieve the practical implementation of this cooling scheme . in the present paper ,",
    "we present such quantitative predictions for the isentropic curves of both the two- and three - dimensional hubbard models .",
    "we display the results in the usual units for the hubbard model , but also in the conventional units used in the context of cold atom physics .    solving the problem for both two- and three - dimensional lattices",
    "fulfills several purposes .",
    "first , the two - dimensional case is interesting in its own right even if long - range order can not be achieved at finite temperature in strictly two dimensions ( because of the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem ) .",
    "indeed , high - temperature parent antiferromagnetic compounds have a strong two - dimensional character .",
    "in addition , even though long - range order can not be achieved , there is a two - dimensional regime with very strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations that is interesting in itself . in this regime",
    ", a pseudogap appears in the single - particle spectral weight that is caused at weak coupling by antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have a correlation length larger than the single - particle de broglie wavelength .",
    "@xcite at strong coupling , the pseudogap appears well before the long antiferromagnetic correlation lengths occur .",
    "kyung:2006 also , considering both two- and three dimensions sheds additional light on the mechanism for cooling .",
    "the hubbard model is defined in second quantization by,@xmath0where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are creation and annihilation operators for electrons of spin @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the density of spin @xmath3 electrons , @xmath5 is the hopping amplitude , and @xmath6 is the on - site repulsion obtained from matrix elements of the contact interaction between atoms in the basis of wannier states of the optical lattice.jaksch:2004,georges:2007 we restrict ourselves to the case where only nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath7coming from tunneling between potential minima is relevant . in keeping with common practice",
    ", @xmath8 will be the energy unit , unless explicitly stated .",
    "let us recall the physics of the cooling mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "werner:2006 . if we denote by @xmath9 the free - energy per lattice site and @xmath10 the corresponding entropy , then @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the double - occupancy .",
    "the chemical potential is kept constant in all partial derivatives without further notice . in the particle - hole symmetric case at half - filling the density",
    "is also constant at constant chemical potential .",
    "we thus have a maxwell relation@xmath14following ref .",
    "@xcite , the shape of the isentropic curves @xmath15 can be deduced by taking a derivative of the last equation and using the maxwell relation eq.(maxwell)@xmath16where @xmath17 is the specific heat . if @xmath18 is negative at small @xmath19 then @xmath20 will be negative and hence it will be possible to lower the temperature at constant entropy by increasing @xmath21 generally , double occupancy increases with temperature so @xmath18 is positive , but it does happen that @xmath18 is negative , leading to a minimum at some temperature .",
    "this result may seem counterintuitive .",
    "indeed , at strong coupling , namely for interaction strength much larger than the bandwidth , such a phenomenon does not occur .",
    "double occupancy is already minimum at zero temperature .",
    "it only increases with increasing temperature . at weak coupling however ,",
    "when the temperature is large enough that it allows states to be occupied over a large fraction of the whole brillouin zone , the electrons may become more localized than at lower temperature . an alternate way to understand this",
    "minimum is to notice that it occurs when the thermal de broglie wavelength is of the order of the lattice spacing : @xcite at larger temperatures , double - occupancy increases because of thermal excitation while at lower temperature the plane - wave nature of the states becomes more apparent and double occupancy also increases .",
    "the minimum in @xmath18 has been observed in dmft @xcite and also very weakly in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of the two - dimensional model at @xmath22 ( see figure 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) while in the two - particle self - consistent ( tpsc ) approach @xcite that we employ along with qmc , very shallow minima are observed in three dimensions and are barely observable in two dimensions depending on the value of @xmath21 @xcite as we shall see , in three dimensions a minimum in @xmath23 is also predicted by second - order perturbation theory . @xcite in the next section we discuss the two methods that we use , emphasizing the points that are specific to this problem .",
    "then we present the results for the constant entropy curves in two and three dimensions and conclude .",
    "two appendices present calculational details for the entropy curves in limiting cases .",
    "in this section we give methodological details that are specific to this work , referring to the literature for more detailed explanations of the qmc and tpsc approaches .      in two dimensions",
    "we perform qmc simulations following the blankenbecler - sugar - scalapino - hirsch ( determinantal ) algorithm . blankenbecler:1981",
    "the standard formula to obtain the entropy consists in integrating the specific heat .",
    "however , the evaluation of the latter quantity involves a numerical derivative . to avoid differentiating data that contains statistical uncertainty , we follow ref . @xcite and perform an integration by parts to compute the entropy from the energy density @xmath24@xmath25with @xmath26 in units where the boltzmann constant equals unity .",
    "this uses the fact that the entropy at infinite temperature is known exactly .",
    "the integral is calculated from the trapezoidal rule on a grid of about twenty points spread on a logarithmic scale that extends from @xmath27 to @xmath28 of order @xmath29 depending on the cases .",
    "each data point is obtained by up to @xmath30 measurements for the @xmath31 lattices and @xmath32 measurements for @xmath33 . by comparing with the known result at @xmath34",
    "we deduce that the error on the integral is of order @xmath35 to @xmath36 at most at the lowest temperatures . at large values of @xmath19 the systematic error due to the discretization of the imaginary time can be quite large .",

    "these effects can be estimated from the @xmath43 case .",
    "@xcite the usual formula for the entropy@xmath44with @xmath45 ( and @xmath46 even ) the number of sites and @xmath9 the fermi - dirac distribution , leads to a residual entropy at @xmath47 given by@xmath48which does vanish for @xmath49 but which gives important contributions for finite @xmath50 for example , for @xmath51 we have @xmath52 compared with @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",

    "our quantitative estimates show a smaller but still appreciable effect . since it occurs at relatively high temperature , that effect is qualitatively captured already by second order perturbation theory .",
    "adiabatic cooling should help in reaching the nel antiferromagnetic transition temperature . reaching the antiferromagnetic phase should be a first step in the study of d - wave superconductivity in optical traps . in two dimensions",
    "however , qmc shows that this mechanism is not very effective , making it impractical to reach the low temperature fluctuating regime by this approach .    in both @xmath61 and @xmath71 it is possible to adiabatically cool starting from the large @xmath6 regime as suggested in ref .",
    "however , in @xmath178 the fluctuating regime can not be reached along a single adiabatic using this approach . in @xmath179",
    "although there are encouraging trends , we can not tell unambiguously with tpsc whether the nel temperature of the heisenberg antiferromagnet can be reached by decreasing @xmath6 along a single adiabatic that starts at high temperature .    in the context of cold fermions , changing the strength of the laser - induced lattice potential changes both hopping @xmath8 and interaction strength @xmath6 . in units of absolute temperature and potential strength",
    "then , the shape of the adiabatic curves are quite different from those in the @xmath97 and @xmath98 units appropriate for the hubbard model . while the change in @xmath8 can ,",
    "for some cases , produce drastic cooling in absolute units , it also changes the shape of the lines for the nel temperature ( in 3d ) and the pseudogap temperature ( in 2d ) .",
    "we have plotted the results for a given scattering length as examples . whether a given isentropic curve crosses the nel or the pseudogap temperature is clearly independent of coordinates . to implement directly the type of interaction driven adiabatic cooling discussed in the present paper , one could change only the interaction strength by manipulating the scattering length with a feshbach resonance .",
    "adiabatic cooling away from half - filling and for other cases can be studied with the methods of this paper .",

    "this is confirmed by the numerical results in this paper .",
    "the expansion should thus be valid for @xmath223 in @xmath224 and @xmath225 in @xmath71 . if , inspired by the exact atomic result eq.([s_atomic ] ) we replace @xmath226 by @xmath227 we recover the limits of validity mentioned in the text .",
    "in addition to this restriction on temperature compared with bandwidth , we note that this asymptotic expansion for the self - energy eq .",
    "( [ exact_self ] ) is clearly a power series in @xmath228 . at half - filling , using the usual canonical transformation to the attractive hubbard model",
    ", we can see that if we absorb the hartree - fock term in the definition of the chemical potential then only even powers of @xmath6 enter the expansion , which makes it convergent even faster .",
    "in addition , it turns out that stopping the expansion of @xmath229 at @xmath230 at half - filling reproduces the exact result in the atomic limit .",
    "hence , in the special case we are interested in , we expect that this high - temperature expansion @xmath231 is excellent for arbitrary values of @xmath19 even if strictly speaking it should be valid only if @xmath232 as well@xmath188    from the above expression for the self - energy and the sum - rule , vilk:1997 @xmath233we can extract the double occupancy @xmath114 that we need to compute the entropy in the high - temperature limit . for the green function , we again assume that @xmath234 this means that we can insert in the previous equation@xmath235this clearly neglects band effects that would contribute to order @xmath236 to double occupancy . the normalized sum over wave - vectors in the sum - rule eq.([consistency ] ) contributes a factor unity while the discrete matsubara sum can be performed exactly .",
    "one finds,@xmath237to extract the entropy , it suffices to use maxwell s relation eq.(maxwell ) so that@xmath238the above expression eq.([s_atomic_improved ] ) with the exact value for @xmath239 neglects terms of order @xmath240 in practice , we found that keeping the non - interacting value of the entropy @xmath241 in the above formula does not improve the comparison with qmc data in the region where @xmath231 is satisfied , whether @xmath6 is small or large .",
    "when we neglect all band effects compared with temperature , then @xmath241 can be replaced by @xmath88 and we recover the atomic limit result eq.([s_atomic ] ) that can also be found from elementary statistical mechanics .",
    "it is the latter result that is useful to understand the data at large values of @xmath21    expansion of @xmath242 above in powers of @xmath243 leads to the perturbative result eq.([s_perturbative ] ) .",
    "one can also arrive at this result by directly neglecting higher powers of @xmath244 and @xmath245 in the self - energy and green function ,    @xmath246    so that@xmath247this result , appearing in eq.([s_perturbative ] ) , keeps all powers in @xmath248 the leading term in @xmath244 and neglects @xmath249 and higher orders ( the entropy is an even function of @xmath6 at half - filling ) .",
    "it does not however assume that @xmath250 it is the large temperature here that controls the expansion .",
    "in practice we found that the above formula does not lead to a good description of the qmc data in any regime , even small @xmath6 and large @xmath101 , unless @xmath251 in the large @xmath6 regime .",
    "this suggests that the corrections @xmath252 are important and in fact cancel the leading one .",
    "note that in all the results of this section , the dimension occurs only in the value of @xmath253 and in the value of @xmath254 the atomic limit is independent of dimension .",
    "in the limit @xmath255 tpsc reproduces the standard perturbative expression for double occupancy .",
    "this can be demonstrated as follows . in tpsc",
    ", double occupancy is obtained from the following sum rule and ansatz vilk:1997,allen:2003 @xmath256we used short - hand notation for wave vector and matsubara frequency @xmath257 . since the self - energy is constant in the first step of tpsc , the irreducible susceptibility takes its non - interacting lindhard value @xmath258 in a perturbation theory in @xmath19 we can expand the right - hand side of the sum rule eq.([spin ] ) and take @xmath259 which leads to@xmath260or@xmath261which shows , as expected , that double - occupancy is decreased by repulsive interactions compared with its hartree - fock value .",
    "the above corresponds to the expression obtained from direct perturbation theory for @xmath262 .",
    "the entropy can be obtained , as usual , from integration of the maxwell relation eq.([maxwell ] ) using the known @xmath263 .",
    "this is how the perturbative result in fig .",
    "perturbation_2_vs_tpsc was obtained .    in the high - temperature limit ,",
    "we recover results of the previous section , as we now proceed to show in two different ways .",
    "tpsc at the first level of approximation obeys the sum rule eq.([consistency ] ) that expresses a consistency between single - particle and two - particle quantities .",
    "the self - energy in the @xmath264 and large matsubara - frequency limit has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq.(e.10 )      in the high - temperature limit @xmath266 that we are interested in , the classical ( zero - frequency ) contribution dominates the sum rules used to find @xmath267 and @xmath268 so that @xmath269 and one recovers that the @xmath270 term has the exact form @xmath271 used in the previous appendix@xmath188 we thus recover the high - temperature perturbative result for the entropy derived there and appearing in eq.(s_perturbative ) .    another way to arrive at the same result in a more transparent way that uses only the first step of the tpsc approach @xmath272 is to work directly with the previous perturbative result eq.([perturbation_exact ] ) and evaluate it in the high temperature limit .",
    "but we first rederive the perturbative result eq.([perturbation_exact ] ) from eq.(43 ) of ref.vilk:1997 that is valid when the correction of double occupancy from its hartree - fock value is small,@xmath273correcting a factor of @xmath35 misprint in ref.@xcite , the quantity @xmath274 is given by@xmath275with @xmath276 a bosonic matsubara frequency and @xmath277 the lindhard function . expanding the denominator in eq.([double_approximate ] ) and substituting @xmath278 and @xmath279",
    "we do recover the perturbative result eq.([perturbation_exact ] ) .    in the limit @xmath231 , the susceptibility @xmath277 scales as @xmath280 which yields terms that are smaller in powers of @xmath281 than the zero - matsubara frequency contribution . neglecting these finite matsubara frequency terms , and taking the large @xmath281 limit where @xmath282 we are left with@xmath283>from this at @xmath278 we can evaluate that @xmath284 so that , to leading order , the approximate double occupancy found from eq.([double_approximate ] ) is @xmath285which leads again to the high - temperature perturbative result found at the end of the previous appendix eq.([derivation_perturbation ] ) and hence to eq.([s_perturbative ] ) .",
    "even if this time we assumed @xmath264 in the last derivation ( there is no mott gap in the one - body green functions ) , the fact that the asymptotic tpsc self - energy eq.([self - asympt_tpsc ] ) in the high - temperature limit reduces to @xmath230 plus corrections that involve two more powers of @xmath244 suggests ( but does not prove ) that the atomic limit is also satisfied by tpsc at high temperature . in the high - temperature limit",
    "where @xmath286 the result that we just found , eq.([s_perturbative ] ) , does reduce to the first two terms of the high - temperature series of the atomic limit .",
