    "the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) , a nasa small explorer mission , is performing the first all - sky imaging and spectroscopic surveys in the space ultraviolet ( 1350 - 2750 ) .",
    "the prime goal of galex is to study star formation in galaxies and its evolution with time .",
    "galex primary mission surveys , and dedicated observations for the guest investigator program beginning october 2004 , will also support a broad array of other investigations .",
    "tinsley , in her seminal 1968 paper @xcite , demonstrated that passive stellar evolution and an evolving stellar birthrate required to match the properties of nearby galaxies had a profound impact on the appearance of galaxies observed over cosmological distances .",
    "it is now doctrine that galaxies can not be used as standard candles for cosmological tests .",
    "the study of distant galaxies has become an exploration of the physical processes that assembled luminous matter in the cores of growing dark matter halos .",
    "tinsley observed that the diversity of galaxies we see today is , at its core , a diversity in star formation histories .",
    "a central goal of cosmology is to measure and explain the star formation , gas depletion , and chemical evolution history in galaxies .",
    "two major developments in the mid 1990 s led new urgency to this goal .",
    "the first was the discovery of a population of star - forming lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the second was the prediction @xcite , based on qso absorption line evolution , and first evidence @xcite for strong evolution in the total cosmic star formation rate .",
    "these culiminated in the now famous plot @xcite of cosmic star formation history , which hinted that the sfr density in the universe was a ten times more vigorous and peaked 5 - 8 gyrs ago .",
    "a major goal is to delineate the cosmic star formation history using any and all metrics .",
    "due in part to the diversity of techniques the current madau plot remains a weak constraint on cosmogenic models .",
    "a parallel effort is now underway to measure the cosmic stellar mass history @xcite if the stellar initial mass function is universal and constant , these histories must agree .",
    "the rest uv provides a powerful tool for measuring and understanding star formation in galaxies at all epochs , a fact underscored by the discovery and study of lyman break galaxies . as emphasized by @xcite ,",
    "even when dust extinction is great , rest uv luminosities remain large enough to be detected in uv - selected surveys .",
    "the james webb space telescope will extend rest uv selection to redshifts of 5 - 20 , perhaps the first generation of stars .",
    "ironically , the interpretation of high redshift galaxies in the rest uv is most limited by the lack of large , systematic surveys of low redshift uv galaxies serving as a benchmark .",
    "while the initial conditions that led to structure formation in the universe are becoming clear @xcite , the formation and evolution of galaxies is tied to the complex behavior of gas dissipating and cooling within dark matter halos and feedback from massive stars . fundamentally lacking in numerical simulations and semi - analytic models",
    "is a predictive physical model for star formation .",
    "technological obstacles have slowed progress in mapping the uv sky to a series of important , but incremental advances .",
    "the orbital astronomical observatory oao-2 @xcite provide the first systematic uv photometry and spectrophotometry of bright stars , globular clusters and nearby galaxies .",
    "the td-1 satellite performed an all - sky spectrophotometric survey of objects to a visual magnitude of 9 - 10 @xcite .",
    "the astronomical netherlands satellite ( ans ) made uv observations of stars , globular clusters , planetary nebulae , and galaxies .",
    "the highly successful international ultraviolet explorer @xcite , the first satellite mission to use an imaging uv detector , obtained thousands of targeted low and high resolution spectra in the 1200 - 3000  band .",
    "along with many other results , these targeted missions provided the foundation for galaxy stellar population synthesis models in the uv .",
    "uv survey experiments , beginning in the 1970 s , used intensified film photography and relatively small telescope apertures .",
    "wide field uv surveys were performed aboard skylab @xcite , by a lunar camera erected by apollo 16 astronauts @xcite , and by the spacelab faust instrument @xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet imaging telescope @xcite obtained a wealth of uv images and results over two shuttle astro missions .",
    "the balloon - borne foca telescope @xcite obtained the first far uv luminosity function for galaxies in the local universe @xcite and the first rest uv anchor point for the star formation history plot .",
    "the galex mission was therefore designed with three overarching primary science goals .",
    "all three goals require the primary galex uv surveys and multiwavelength corrolary data .",
    "galex surveys are therefore designed to exploit existing and planned surveys in other bands .",
    "the first goal is to provide a calibration of uv and galaxy star formation rate , accounting for , in order of declining impact , extinction , starburst history , initial mass function and metallicity .",
    "this calibration would be obtained over a wide range of star formation environments and modalities , so that the relationships can be applied to galaxies at cosmic epochs where star formation may assume a very different character .",
    "as we show in figure [ fig_tmean_ssfr ] , uv provides a measure of star formation on timescales @xmath610@xmath7 yrs . in galaxies with smoothly varying star formation histories",
    ", uv provides a linear measure of the current star formation rate once the extinction problem is solved .",
    "a major galex objective is to determine the minimum set of observations required to measure intrinsic extinction , in the spirit of the starburst uv slope - infrared excess relationship of @xcite . in galaxies with more complex star formation histories ,",
    "uv probes timescales relevant to starbursts triggered by major interactions and mergers , a core element of hierarchical structure models .",
    "the second galex goal is to use the rest uv surveys to determine the cosmic star formation history over the redshift range @xmath4  ( the last 9 gyrs ) and its dependence on environment , mass , morphology , merging , and star formation modality ( notably quiescent vs. interacting / merging ) .",
    "this history could then be laid side by side with ground , hst , jwst , and other optical - near ir surveys of rest uv galaxies at redshifts 1.5@xmath820 ( the first 4 gyrs ) to yield a consistent measurement of galaxy building over the age of the universe .",
    "a key strength of rest uv observations is the decoupling of recent and old star formation histories . as we show in figure [ fig_tmean_ssfr ] , the rest uv scales with star formation rate over a very wide range of specific star formation rates , parameterized by @xmath9 , the ratio of present to average star formation rates over the life of the galaxy .",
    "finally , the third galex goal is to use both large statistical samples and detailed studies of nearby galaxies , again with abundant multiwavelength data , to inform and inspire a predictive model of global star formation rates in diverse contexts .",
    "the galex instrument employs a novel optical design using a 50 cm diameter modified ritchey - chrtien telescope with four channels : far - uv ( fuv ) and near - uv ( nuv ) imaging , and fuv and nuv spectroscopy .",
    "the telescope has a 3-m focal length and is coated with al - mgf@xmath10 .",
    "the field of view is 1.2 degrees circular .",
    "an optics wheel place a caf@xmath10 imaging window , a caf@xmath10 transmission grism , or an opaque position in the beam .",
    "spectroscopic observations are obtained at multiple grism - sky dispersion angles , also selectable , to remove spectrum overlap effects .",
    "the fuv ( 1350 - 1750 ) and nuv ( 1750 - 2750 ) bands are obtained simultaneously using a dichroic beam splitter that also acts as a field aberration corrector . the beam splitter / asphere is an ion - etched fused - silica plate with aspheric surfaces on both sides .",
    "beam splitting is accomplished with a dielectric multilayer on the input side , which reflects the fuv band and transmits the nuv band .",
    "the detector system ( provided by a team led by u.c.berkeley including caltech , jpl , and southwest research ) encorporates sealed tube microchannel plate detectors with 65 mm active area and crossed delay - line anodes for photon event position readout .",
    "the fuv detector is preceded by a blue - edge filter that blocks the night - side airglow lines of oi1304 , 1356 , and ly@xmath11 .",
    "the nuv detector is preceded by a red blocking filter / fold mirror , which produces a sharper long - wavelength cutoff than the detector cste photocathode and thereby reduces the zodiacal light background and optical contamination .",
    "the nuv detector has a mgf@xmath10 window which includes power for field flattening , and an opaque csi photocathode on the microchannel plate .",
    "the nuv detector has a fused silica window which also includes power for field flattening , and a semitransparent cs@xmath10te photocathode on the window inner surface proximity focused across a 300 @xmath12 m gap .",
    "the detector peak qe is 12% ( fuv ) and 8% ( nuv ) . in orbit dark background is low , 20/60 cps ( fuv / nuv ) for diffuse background , as compared to the lowest total nightsky backgrounds of 1500/10,000 cps .",
    "the detectors are linear up to a local ( stellar ) countrate of 100 ( fuv ) , 400 ( nuv ) cps , which corresponds to m@xmath13 .",
    "the system angular resolution , which includes contributions from the optical and detector psf , and ex post facto aspect reconstruction , is typically 4.5/6.0 ( fuv / nuv ) arseconds ( fwhm ) , and varies by @xmath620% over the field of view due to variations in the detector resolution .",
    "the grism , fabricated by jobin - yvon in paris , is a ruled caf@xmath10 prism with a small curvature on the input side . in order to provide simultaneous coverage of the 1350 - 2750  range",
    ", the grism is blazed in 1st order for the nuv band and in 2nd order for the fuv band , and obtains peak absolute efficiencies of 80% and 60% respectively .",
    "spectral resolution is 200/100 ( fuv 2nd order / nuv 1st order ) . on orbit angular resolution and instrument throughput",
    "are as expected from ground calibration .",
    "a more complete description of the instrument and satellite can be found in @xcite .",
    "galex was launched by a pegasus - xl vehicle on april 28 , 2003 into a 29 degree inclination , 690 km circular , 98.6 minute period orbit .",
    "galex began nominal operations on august 2 .",
    "a summary of on - orbit performance is given in table [ tab_summary ] , and more details on the on - orbit performance are given in the following paper by @xcite .",
    "the eight surveys listed in table [ tab_surveys ] are being performed concurrently for the first 38 months .",
    "the mission design is simple .",
    "science data is obtained only on the night side . on the day side ,",
    "the satellite is in solar panel - sun orientation .",
    "as the satellite enters twilight , it slews to one of the survey targets .",
    "the imaging window or grism is selected , and the detector high voltage ramped from idle .",
    "all observations are performed in a pointed mode with an arcminute spiral dither to average non - uniformities and to prevent detector fatigue by bright stars .",
    "individual photon events , time - tagged to 1 - 5 msec accuracy , are stored on the spacecraft solid - state tape recorder along with housekeeping data . at the end of each orbital night",
    ", detector high voltages are ramped back to idle levels to protect detectors from damage and the spacecraft returns to solar array pointed attitude .",
    "up to four times per 24 hour day the solid state recorder is dumped via the x - band transmitter to ground stations in hawaii or perth , australia .",
    "the galex data analysis pipeline operated at the caltech science operations center receives the time - tagged photon lists , instrument / spacecraft housekeeping and satellite aspect information . from these data sets ,",
    "the pipeline reconstructs the aspect vs. time and generates images , spectra and source catalogs .",
    "the first pipeline module corrects the photon positions for detector and optical distortions and calculates an optimal aspect solution based on the time - tagged photon data and star catalogs .",
    "a photometric module accumulates the photons into count , intensity and effective area maps and extracts sources using the well known sextractor program , augmented by significant pre - processing of the input images , as well as post - processing the resulting source catalog .",
    "a spectroscopic module uses galex image source catalog inputs to extract spectra of these sources from the multiple slitless grism observations .",
    "night sky backgrounds in the galex bands are low : the fuv[nuv ] is dominated by diffuse galactic light[zodiacal light ] , with typical levels 27.5[26.5 ] mag arcsec@xmath14 corresponding to 3[30 ] photon / psf in one eclipse .",
    "surveys become background limited at m@xmath1523.5 .",
    "targets are constrained by the current bright star limit for the detectors ( 5 kcps ) which makes 50% of the sky inaccessible . with the nuv detector",
    "off , 72% of the sky is accessible .",
    "this limit will be raised to 50 kcps shortly after ground verification tests . with this new limit",
    ", 95% of the sky can be surveyed in fuv - only mode , and 87% with both detectors operating .",
    "_ all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) . _",
    "the goal of the ais is to survey the entire sky subject to a sensitivity of m@xmath0 , comparable to the poss ii ( m@xmath16=21 ) and sdss spectroscopic ( m@xmath16=17.6 ) limits .",
    "several hundred to 1000 objects are in each 1 deg@xmath1  field .",
    "the ais is performed in roughly ten 100-second pointed exposures per eclipse ( @xmath610 deg@xmath1  per eclipse )",

    "in this dedicated astrophysical journal letters issue , we describe a selection of early results obtained from the galex surveys . in this introductory letter",

    "galex observations demonstrate that rest uv emission traces star formation in a wide variety of contexts , environments and modalities . in nearby quiescent disk galaxies ( m101 , m51 , m33 )",
    "galex observations provide the ages , luminosities , masses , and extinction of star formation complexes .",
    "these show that the cluster age distribution is consistent with a constant star formation rate over the last 10@xmath22 myrs @xcite .",
    "galex has discovered extended uv emission far outside ( 2 - 4 times ) the optical disk of a number of nearby spiral galaxies , including m83 and ngc628 .",
    "star formation appears to proceed at gas surface densities below the typical galaxian threshold , and the complexes formed appear to have lower luminosity and mass , and younger ages than those in the inner disk @xcite .    in the antennae merger system ,",
    "recent star formation has occured in the disk , tails and tidal dwarf galaxy on timescales less than the 300 myr dynamical time , implying that star formation is triggered in the tidal streams after gas leaves the galaxy @xcite .",
    "galex has detected uv emission in extended tidal tails of a number of other interacting galaxies @xcite showing ages less than interaction times , suggesting that interaction - induced star formation in tidal gas streams may be a common phenomenon .",
    "star formation triggered in an hi cloud 50 kpc from centaurus a @xcite is easily detected in the uv .",
    "all of these phenomena are likely to be more common at high redshift .",
    "large area , unbiased , multiwavelength surveys support a robust statistical study of the fundamental properties of galaxies .",
    "galex provides an unprecedented measurement of star formation rates .",
    "when combined with rest optical / near ir , the key parameter of star formation rate per unit stellar mass ( specific star formation rate ) , which is closely related to the current star formation rate with respect to the average ( the @xmath9 parameter ) , can be determined over a wide dynamic range .",
    "galex combined with the sloan digital sky survey forms a powerful dataset .",
    "galex - sdss colors provide preliminary source classification and characterization @xcite , separating main sequence , post - main - sequence , and binary stars , qsos , and galaxies .",
    "galex / sdss photometry provide excellent measurement of the ratio of current to average star formation rates ( the @xmath9-parameter ) and important constraints on starburst history in the local universe @xcite .    in the local universe",
    "uv luminosities follow a schechter function with @xmath23l@xmath19 @xcite , with measureably different parameters for red and blue subsamples and evidence for evolution @xcite .",
    "the luminosity functions and densities are significantly fainter than those obtained by foca .",
    "galex on - orbit calibration shows excellent agreement with the ground calibration @xcite , so we attribute this discrepency to an overestimate of fluxes at faint magnitudes by foca .",
    "galex number count distributions fall below those of foca , show some evidence for evolution , and show some flattening at faint magnitudes due to a combination of blending , confusion , and faint wing overlap @xcite .",
    "galex dis data , combined with the vlt / vimos redshift survey , has provided the first galex measurements of the evolution of the uv luminosity function and density @xcite .",
    "significant evolution is found , consistent with @xmath24 . when corrected for extinction using the @xcite prescription , this provides the first galex measurements of cosmic sfr history over @xmath25 @xcite . when combined with consistent analysis of deep optical data from hdf - n @xcite ,",
    "the results suggest a monotonic decline in the star formation rate density since z=3 , rather than a peak at @xmath26 .",
    "the galex ais / mis - sdss dr1 matched datasets have yielded the discovery of luminous uv galaxies ( lugs ) , with uv luminosities and properties comparable to distant lyman break galaxies , in the local universe @xcite .",
    "lugs have 500 times lower volume density than lbgs , but their density rises sharply toward higher redshift @xcite .",
    "lugs may provide an excellent opportunity to study low redshift analogs to massive star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "uv extinction by dust remains the principle obstacle in converting uv luminosity directly to sfr . in individual galaxies ( m83 and m101 ) , we show that extinction is a strongly declining function of radius and may contain a significant diffuse , interarm component @xcite .    with iras data ,",
    "we have begun to characterize the properties of fuv and far - ir selected galaxy samples in the local universe .",
    "as expected , flux - limited uv and far - ir selected samples yield different projections of the bivariate uv / far - ir luminosity function and distinct uv / far - ir ratios @xcite .",
    "however , virtually all star - forming galaxies detected in local far - ir - selected samples are also detected by galex .",
    "the sfr luminosity function places a fundamental constraint on cosmological models .",
    "the bivariate uv / fir luminosity function , obtained from combined uv and fir selected samples , shows a bimodal behavior : @xmath27 tracks @xmath28 for @xmath29 l@xmath19 , and @xmath27 saturates for higher total luminosities .",
    "the total sfr function is log - normal function over four decades of luminosity @xcite .",
    "starburst galaxies in the local universe display a well - known relationship between uv slope ( @xmath30 ) and far - ir - to - uv luminosity ratio ( irx ) . early results from galex indicate that 1 ) normal and quiescent star forming galaxies fall below the canonical irx-@xmath30 relation for starbursts , perhaps due to starburst age @xcite ; and 2 ) the difference between starbursts and ulirgs within irx-@xmath30 space is not as distinct as previously suggested , which is consistent with our observation that galaxies span a continuum in the bivariate uv / far - ir luminosity function .",
    "in addition to recent star formation , uv traces dust through scattering and absorption , gas by emission lines and two - photon continuum , hot evolved stars and late - type stellar chromospheres , degenerate binaries , and qsos . while some 15 - 20% of `` normal '' elliptical galaxies show evidence for residual star formation at the 1 - 2% level @xcite , quiescent ellipticals ( notably in rich clusters ) exhibit the well known uv excess but without the previously claimed correlation with metallicity @xcite .",
    "the m82 outflow , prominent in figure [ fig_m81m82 ] , is injecting abundant dust into the igm , which reflects uv from the obscured staburst @xcite . in our own galaxy ,",

    "<S> the surveys include an all - sky imaging survey ( m@xmath0 ) , a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg@xmath1(m@xmath2 ) , a deep imaging survey of 100 square degrees ( m@xmath3 ) , and a nearby galaxy survey . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic ( slitless ) grism surveys ( r=100 - 200 ) are underway with various depths and sky coverage . </S>",
    "<S> many targets overlap existing or planned surveys in other bands . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the measured uv properties of local galaxies , along with corollary observations , to calibrate the relationship of uv and global star formation rate in local galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the redshift range @xmath4 , and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the galex mission includes a guest investigator program supporting the wide variety of programs made possible by the first uv sky survey . </S>"
