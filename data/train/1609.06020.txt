    "this paper deals with tomographic image reconstruction under the situation where some of projection data ( sinogram ) bins are contaminated with abnormal data , _",
    "i.e. _ impulsive noise with heavy tails , and locations of the abnormal bins are unknown .",
    "we believe that such situations occur in various instances of tomography due to unexpected troubles in detector , x - ray source or power supply , data transfer errors , metal in the object , misalignments in scanner geometry , and phase wrapping in phase tomography .",
    "however , according to our knowledge , there exist very few ( almost no , to the best of our knowledge ) literatures which deal with image reconstruction to handle such situations . on the other hand , in other fields such as statistics , computer vision , and machine learning , the problem of estimating some physical parameters from a set of measured data containing the abnormal errors ( outliers ) has been recognized as an important research topic so that there exist a lot of research activities .",
    "we propose a new image reconstruction algorithm called the fault - tolerant reconstruction outlined as follows . in ordinary iterative reconstructions ,",
    "the least - squares error @xmath1 defined as the @xmath0 norm difference between forward - projected projection data @xmath4 and measured projection data @xmath5 is used as a cost function [ 1],[2 ] .",
    "however , it is well - known that the least - squares criterion is sensitive to the existence of abnormal data in the measurement @xmath5 . a simple method to estimate the locations of abnormal bins and exclude the corresponding data from the data",
    "fitting is to utilize the @xmath2-norm difference @xmath3 between @xmath4 and @xmath5 instead of the @xmath0 norm [ 3],[4 ] .",
    "based on this idea , we develop a row - action - type iterative algorithm minimizing the @xmath2 norm error function using the proximal splitting framework in convex optimization fields [ 5],[6 ] .",
    "the resulting algorithm resembles the structure of art ( algebraic reconstruction technique ) algorithm [ 7],[8 ] .",
    "we also propose an improved version of the @xmath2-norm approach called the @xmath2-tv reconstruction , in which a weak total variation ( tv ) penalty function is added to the cost function [ 9]-[11 ] .",
    "we performed simulation studies for typical scenarios assuming detector errors , x - ray radiation errors , and random errors in projection data space . in all of the simulated scenarios ,",
    "reconstructed images with the @xmath0-norm were severely damaged by the effect of abnormal bins , whereas images with the @xmath2-norm and @xmath2-tv reconstructions were surprisingly robust to the existence of abnormal bins .",
    "this section describes the setup of image reconstruction problem dealt in this paper , and derives the corresponding noise model together with the cost function used in image reconstruction .",
    "we denote an image by a @xmath6-dimensional vector @xmath7 and denote a corresponding projection data ( sinogram ) by an @xmath8-dimensional vector @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the system matrix which relates @xmath10 to @xmath5 by @xmath11 , where we assume that @xmath12 , _",
    "i.e. _ the linear equation @xmath13 is overdetermined .",
    "then , the measurement process of projection data is expressed as @xmath14    where @xmath15 denotes measurement noise . in ordinary iterative reconstructions ,",
    "the cost function is designed by assuming that the noise component @xmath16 follows independent gaussian distribution or independent poisson distribution . on the other hand , in this paper ,",
    "we consider the abnormal error noise ( aen ) model , in which most elements of @xmath16 are zeros but only a small number of elements of @xmath16 take non - zero abnormal error values occurred by various physical reasons described in section 1 .",
    "we assume that the abnormal projection data takes a value over the pre - specified interval @xmath17 $ ] with a uniform probability , where @xmath18 are pre - specified constants corresponding to the dynamic range to control error severity . to demonstrate that the abnormal errors in only a small number of projection data bins lead to significant artifacts , in fig . 1 , we show examples of reconstructed images for three typical cases , _",
    "i.e. _ data corresponding to one detector element contains the error , data corresponding to one projection angle contains the error , and randomly selected five projection data bins contain the error .",
    "furthermore , we also assume that locations of the abnormal data bins are unknown .",
    "below , we explain that such noise model can be well represented by using a particular case of generalized gaussian probability density function . in the generalized gaussian model ,",
    "the likelihood function of @xmath5 given @xmath10 is expressed as @xmath19    where @xmath20 denotes the partition function , @xmath21 denotes the ( variance ) parameter of density function , and @xmath22 denotes the @xmath23-norm with @xmath24 as the norm parameter . for unfamiliar readers ,",
    "the definition of @xmath22 is expressed as @xmath25    where @xmath26 .",
    "it is well - known that the noise model corresponding to @xmath27 is the independent gaussian model , which is used when the additive noise @xmath16 follows the independent gaussian distribution with a same variance for all the bins . also , the noise model corresponding to @xmath28 is the independent laplacian model , which can handle heavy tail noise like impulsive noise better compared with the gaussian [ 12 ] .",
    "the most appropriate noise model for the above aen model is the case of @xmath29 due to the following reason . in the case of @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath30 inside @xmath31 becomes the so - called @xmath32-norm , which represents the number of non - zero elements in the noise vector @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding likelihood @xmath34 becomes large when @xmath33 has only a small number of non - zero elements , which matches to the assumption of aen model .",
    "the similar discussion on the above property of @xmath32-norm can be found in many literatures of compressed sensing ( cs ) [ 13],[14 ] .",
    "furthermore , by taking the negative logarithm of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we obtain the cost function of image reconstruction @xmath35 to be minimized corresponding to the aen model as @xmath36    however , as is well - known in the cs fields [ 13],[14 ] , the @xmath32-norm is a non - convex function in which its exact minimization is of np - hard complexity .",
    "so , by following the standard approximation used in the cs fields , we replace the @xmath32-norm by the @xmath2-norm as @xmath37    this replacement is popular in the cs fields and is called the convex relaxation in optimization literatures [ 13],[14 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard cost function in image reconstruction fields is the @xmath0-norm expressed as @xmath38    equation ( 6 ) is derived from the gaussian noise model by putting @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , which is quite different from the aen model .",
    "therefore , in image reconstruction under the aen model , we expect that there exist significant differences in image quality between eq .",
    "( 5 ) and eq . ( 6 ) . actually ,",
    "in section 3 , we demonstrate that there exist surprisingly large differences between the @xmath2-norm reconstruction and the @xmath0-norm reconstruction .",
    "one more remark is as follows .",
    "the above derivation inspires that our method is same as image reconstruction using the cs technique .",
    "in the cs fields , the @xmath2-norm is normally used in regularization terms to pick up sparse solutions @xmath10 from a large number of feasible solutions .",
    "however , we use the @xmath2-norm for data fidelity ( likelihood ) terms .",
    "such approaches are frequently used in statistics , computer vision , and data mining to mitigate the effect of outliers in the data fitting , with various different terminologies such as robust statistics , robust estimation , and outlier detection [ 3],[4],[15],[16 ] .",
    "however , according to our knowledge , there exist very few ( almost no ) literatures to use it in tomographic image reconstructions .",
    "the most significant contribution in this paper is to propose a row - action - type iterative algorithm for the @xmath2-norm image reconstruction , which resembles the structure of famous art algorithm [ 7],[8 ] .",
    "the algorithm derivation is based on a framework called the proximal splitting in convex optimization fields [ 5],[6 ] . before going into the concrete derivation ,",
    "we briefly review the proximal splitting together with some related basic knowledges .",
    "let us consider a convex minimization problem formulated as @xmath39    where we assume that @xmath35 is a possibly non - differentiable lower semi - continuous ( lsc ) convex function .",
    "[ proximity operator and proximal algorithm ] [ 17 ] the proximity ( prox ) operator corresponding to @xmath35 is defined by @xmath40    where the parameter @xmath21 is called the stepsize parameter .",
    "two nice properties of the @xmath41 operator are that it can be defined for any lsc convex function even if it is non - differentiable like the @xmath2-norm ( including convex constraint ) , and that its fixed points , _ i.e. _ @xmath10 satisfying @xmath42 , coincide with minimizers of @xmath35 for any @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath41 operator is necessarily a non - expansive mapping .",
    "these properties allow us to use the following iteration formula to find a minimizer of @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath44    where @xmath45 denotes the iteration number .",
    "this iterative algorithm is called the proximal minimization algorithm , which provides a powerful framework for non - differentiable convex minimizations .",
    "[ proximal splitting ] [ 5],[6 ] let us consider a convex minimization problem formulated as @xmath46    where @xmath47 are possibly non - differentiable lsc component functions and @xmath48 .",
    "we consider the situation where the @xmath41 operator corresponding to @xmath35 is intensive to compute , but the @xmath41 operator corresponding to every @xmath49 can be computed in low costs .",
    "the proximal splitting is a framework to construct an iterative algorithm to minimize @xmath35 under such situations . in most literatures on the proximal",
    "splitting , the number of component functions ( splitting ) @xmath8 is 2 [ 5 ] . in this paper",
    ", we employ a multi - splitting version , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath50 , described and investigated by passty , because it naturally leads to a row - action - type iterative algorithm which resembles the structure of art algorithm [ 6 ] .",
    "its principle is to compute the prox operator corresponding to each component function @xmath49 sequentially according to the order @xmath51 to obtain the next iterate @xmath52 from the previous iterate @xmath53 .",
    "the iteration formula of passty proximal splitting is summarized in algorithm 1 .",
    "l algorithm 1 : passty proximal splitting algorithm + give an initial vector @xmath54 . execute the following .",

    ", passty proved the following theorem [ 6 ] .",
    "[ theorem ] we consider an ergodic average of the iterates @xmath62 in algorithm 1 defined by @xmath63    then , @xmath64 converges to a minimizer of @xmath35 when the diminishing stepsize rule satisfying the following equations is used .",
    "@xmath65    we note that the above convergence is called the ergodic convergence , which is weaker than the convergence of sequence @xmath66 itself to a minimizer of @xmath35 . in practice , however , we have never observed a situation in which the ergodic convergence occurs but the sequence @xmath66 itself is not convergent .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that the proposed algorithm can be used without being anxious about the non - convergence .",
    "the proposed row - action - type iterative algorithm for the @xmath2-norm reconstruction is derived from algorithm 1 according to the following steps .",

    "next , the prox operator corresponding to each @xmath49 appearing in algorithm 1 is calculated , which amounts to solving the following optimization problem .",
    "@xmath70    this problem can be solved in closed form by using the standard lagrange multiplier technique [ 18],[19 ] .",
    "first , by introducing an additional variable @xmath71 , the above minimization problem can be converted into the constrained minimization @xmath72    the lagrangian function corresponding to eq .",

    "( 18 ) , we used the fact that @xmath80 when @xmath81 or @xmath82 and @xmath83 when @xmath84 so that the domain of @xmath76 becomes @xmath85 . furthermore , eq .",
    "( 19 ) is obtained from the minimization with respect to @xmath10 in the second equation in eq .",

    "in tomographic reconstruction fields , there is a strong trend that people prefer such iterative algorithms , because they can be implemented easily thanks to the necessity of accessing only a single row of @xmath69 for each image update .",
    "furthermore , it is known that such algorithms can be accelerated by using the special data access order described by herman and meyer [ 8 ] .",
    "we use this data access order in our implementations .",
    "the above algorithm derivation can be also used to develop an analogous row - action - type algorithm for the @xmath0-norm reconstruction in eq . ( 6 ) . a comparison between the iteration formula for the @xmath2-norm reconstruction and that for the @xmath0-norm reconstruction provides a useful insight together with a nice intuitive interpretation into the proposed algorithm . in this section ,",
    "we perform such a comparison . first , by using the same algorithm derivation outlined above to the @xmath0-norm cost function in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we obtain the following iteration formula .",
    "@xmath99    the iteration formulae for both the @xmath2-norm and @xmath0-norm reconstructions possess a row - action - type structure [ 20 ] .",
    "the major difference lies in the way to compute the value of variable @xmath74 which can be interpreted as the amount of update along the vector @xmath68 . from the description of algorithm 2 in the @xmath2-norm reconstruction ,",
    "the value @xmath74 is truncated to -1 or 1 when the residual error @xmath100 is large . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( 22 ) , such truncation is not performed in the @xmath0-norm reconstruction at all .",
    "intuitively , this truncation can be considered a judgement whether the measured data @xmath101 contains an abnormal error or not . when @xmath102 is large , it can be expected that @xmath101 is contaminated by the abnormal error , so the amount of update @xmath74 is truncated to a small value to avoid overfitting to the erroneous data .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath102 is small , it is expected that @xmath101 is free from the abnormal error , so the amount of update is used without the truncation . since the @xmath0-norm reconstruction is based on the independent gaussian noise model , such truncation operation is not necessary because every projection data value is contaminated with noise having the same standard deviation . in conclusion , from the above discussion , we expect that the @xmath2-norm reconstruction is robust against the existence of abnormal data in the projection data .",
    "we demonstrate that the difference between the @xmath2-norm reconstruction and the @xmath0-norm reconstruction is surprisingly large in section 3 .     and",

    "the reason is that the tv penalty imposed on @xmath10 helps in eliminating streak artifacts generated by the abnormal data in image space , in addition to identifying and excluding the abnormal data in projection space .",

    "this is an empirical method to remove the effect of abnormal errors .",
    "the median filter is applied to degraded projection data to remove the abnormal errors followed by the @xmath0-norm reconstruction .",
    "the window size of median filter was empirically determined in such a way that visual quality of reconstructed image is best dependent on each case .",
    "[ @xmath2-norm reconstruction ] the @xmath2-norm reconstruction ( algorithm 2 ) was implemented with the iteration number 50 .",
    "[ @xmath2-tv reconstruction ] the @xmath2-tv reconstruction ( algorithm 3 ) was implemented with the iteration number 50 .",
    "we show reconstructed images together with the degraded projection data for all the scenarios in figs .",
    "in all the scenarios , the images by the @xmath0-norm reconstruction were severely damaged by the abnormal errors , in which the artifact patterns , _ i.e. _ streaks , random errors , etc .",
    ", depend on the locations of abnormal bins .",
    "the empirical projection space median filtering succeeded in reducing the artifacts , but the filtering also affects the correct data so that we can observe some additional artifacts in the final images . on the other hand , for the cases of detector error 1 , angle error 1 , and random error 1 with relatively mild errors ,",
    "the power of identifying the abnormal bins in both the @xmath2-norm and @xmath2-tv reconstructions were significant in which they succeeded in reconstructing almost perfect images .",

    "in these cases , the @xmath2-tv reconstruction correctly identified most of the abnormal bins whereas the @xmath2-norm reconstruction did not succeed perfectly . with respect to convergence speed of the @xmath2-norm and @xmath2-tv reconstructions , they were a bit slower compared with the @xmath0-norm reconstruction and the standard art algorithm mainly because early iterations need to be spent to correctly identify the locations of abnormal bins .",
    "however , thanks to their row - action structures , they seem to be still significantly faster than using the standard @xmath2-norm and @xmath2-tv minimization algorithms ( for example , popular iterative reweighted least - squares method [ 3],[4 ] ) which can be used for the same cost functions .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a new image reconstruction algorithm called the fault - tolerant reconstruction for tomographic imaging situation where a small number of projection data bins are contaminated by abnormal errors occurred during the measurement by some physical reasons .",

    "<S> we propose a new reconstruction algorithm called the fault - tolerant reconstruction outlined as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the least - squares ( @xmath0-norm ) error function @xmath1 used in ordinary iterative reconstructions is sensitive to the existence of abnormal data . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed algorithm utilizes the @xmath2-norm error function @xmath3 instead of the @xmath0-norm , and we develop a row - action - type iterative algorithm using the proximal splitting framework in convex optimization fields . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose an improved version of the @xmath2-norm reconstruction called the @xmath2-tv reconstruction , in which a weak total variation ( tv ) penalty is added to the cost function . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results demonstrate that reconstructed images with the @xmath0-norm were severely damaged by the effect of abnormal bins , whereas images with the @xmath2-norm and @xmath2-tv reconstructions were robust to the existence of abnormal bins . </S>"
