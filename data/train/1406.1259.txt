    "stars in a given star cluster are usually assumed to have originated from the same progenitor molecular cloud , from which they formed at approximately the same time . in turn , this implies that they would share the same metallicity ( at least within a narrow range determined by the metallicity of the progenitor molecular cloud ) .",
    "these assumptions , which form the basis of the so - called ( simple ) single stellar population ( ssp ) model , have led to numerous very successful star cluster analyses .",
    "if we also assume that most stars evolve in isolation , then one can use a unique theoretical isochrone to describe the combination of main - sequence ( ms ) , subgiant - branch ( sgb ) , and red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "however , for many intermediate - age star clusters , and certainly for old globular clusters ( gcs ) , the ssp approximation seems to break down .",
    "the discovery of striking , extended ms turnoffs ( emstos ) in many intermediate - age and old star clusters has led to a resurgence of the field of stellar population synthesis .",
    "most authors suggest that the observed emstos in , e.g. , ngc 1783 @xcite , ngc 1846 @xcite , or ngc 1868 @xcite , can be adequately described by assuming a cluster - internal age dispersion of roughly 300 myr @xcite , which hence challenges the applicability of the ssp approach .",
    "alternative models , which maintain the ssp assumption , suggest that fast stellar rotation may be the cause of the observed emstos @xcite ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for some gcs , the breakdown of the ssp model assumptions is particularly convincing .",
    "for instance , some old gcs display double or multiple mss , such as ngc 2808 @xcite and ngc 6397 @xcite ; in addition , @xcite found that ngc 1851 is characterized by two distinct sgbs .",
    "some gcs  such as @xmath5 centauri @xcite , ngc 288 @xcite , and m22 @xcite  exhibit double or multiple mss , sgbs , and/or rgbs ; terzan 5 even shows clear , double hb clumps @xcite .",
    "all of these observations strongly indicate that at least some of the very old gcs contain multiple stellar populations .",
    "the galactic gc 47 tucanae ( 47 tuc ; ngc 104 ) is another typical target cluster that convincingly displays multiple stellar population features across its entire color ",
    "magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "it has also been known for a long time that 47 tuc displays a clear nitrogen ( n ) dichotomy @xcite .",
    "the cluster has been found to host at least two distinct mss @xcite , a broadening of the sgb or ( alternatively ) multiple sgbs @xcite , as well as double or multiple rgbs @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite analyzed the radial gradients in rgb - bump and horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars , which indicate the presence of a helium - enriched second stellar generation in 47 tuc .",
    "@xcite determined a na  o anticorrelation in 47 tuc , a signature typically seen in galactic gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and which indicates contamination by products of the proton - capture process @xcite .",
    "in other gcs ( e.g. , in m71 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) such anticorrelations are even found in some less evolved ms stars , which have not reached sufficiently high temperatures to trigger proton capture .",
    "this implies the presence of more than one stellar population in galactic gcs .",
    "different origins have been proposed to account for the secondary stellar generations ; they mainly invoke scenarios involving accretion of the ejecta of intermediate - mass stars @xcite , rapidly rotating massive stars @xcite , massive binaries @xcite , and evolved asymptotic - giant - branch stars @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that second - generation stars originating from their first - generation counterparts are generally more centrally concentrated @xcite .",
    "@xcite , which implies that the vast majority of the cluster s member stars analyzed here are located outside of the cluster s half - mass radius and thus unrelaxed . ] indeed , in 47 tuc @xcite investigated the radial behavior of two distinct rgb populations , as well as that of two subgroups of hb stars .",
    "they concluded that second - generation stars gradually start to dominate at increasingly smaller radii .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 4 ) based on chemical abundance analysis .",
    "@xcite explored the global characteristics of the sgb stars in 47 tuc .",
    "they pointed out that the broadening of the sgb in the 47 tuc cmd indicates the presence of more than one stellar population , but because of constraints inherent to their sample selection , they could not investigate a promising radial trend related to a possible second generation of sgb stars in 47 tuc .    in this article , we present a deep , large - area , near - infrared ( nir ) cmd of 47 tuc , obtained with the 4 m visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) .",
    "we confirm that the cluster s sgb and rgb are significantly broadened , which can not be explained as simply owing to the effects of either photometric uncertainties or ( differential ) extinction .",
    "compared with @xcite , the rgb s radial behavior we find displays a more obvious radial color bias .",
    "we find that the average color of the rgb stars at large radii is significantly different from that in the innermost regions .",
    "the apparent color gradient strongly indicates that the two rgb populations contain significantly different fractions of stars formed as part of a second stellar generation .",
    "following @xcite , we also find that the cluster s sgb is significantly broadened .",
    "the sgb stars in the periphery are on average significantly brighter than the innermost sgb stars .",
    "all of these features are so striking that they can even be clearly seen based on a single , quick glance at the cluster s global cmd .",
    "the present paper focuses on new , high - quality nir observations of 47 tuc , which offers an excellent comparison data set to the ultraviolet / optical study of @xcite .",
    "we also highlight that our observations cover a significantly larger field than that of @xcite : our data set s maximum distance to the cluster s central region reaches 4000@xmath6 ( compared with the radial range out to 1500@xmath6 available in the earlier publication ) . pc . ]",
    "we can thus very well characterize the effects caused by background contamination .",

    "we describe the data reduction approach .",
    "section 3 presents the main results , which we discuss in section 4 .",
    "a brief summary and our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",

    "its main goals and first data are described in @xcite .",
    "47 tuc is fortuitously located in front of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , on vmc tile `` smc 5@xmath72 , '' which made it an ideal target for early vmc data acquisition .",
    "the vmc images were reduced by the cambridge astronomy survey unit ( casu ) using the vista data flow system ( vdfs ) pipeline @xcite . to perform our point - spread - function ( psf ) photometry",
    "starting from the pawprint vmc images , we selected  in all three filters ( @xmath8)epochs with limited seeing inhomogeneities .",
    "the selected reduced data , comprising two epochs in @xmath9 and @xmath10 and nine in @xmath11 , are psf - homogenized and stacked to obtain a deep tile image ( using a novel method that will be described in detail by rubele et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "we performed psf photometry on the deep image of tile smc 5@xmath12 , using the iraf daophot package @xcite .",
    "the psf and allstar tasks were used to produce psf models and perform the final photometry .",
    "we checked and corrected our psf photometry for aperture effects using catalogs retrieved from the vista science archive @xcite for the bulk of the observed stars .    here , we focus our analysis on the @xmath13 cmd , where the features of interest are most apparent , because this color extends over the longest available wavelength range . however , we confirmed that our conclusions also hold based on analysis of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 cmds .",
    "our observations cover an area of roughly @xmath16 deg@xmath17 .",
    "the bulk of the 47 tuc stars are located toward the southwest of this region , so that the opposite corner of the field is suitable for analysis of the field - star properties , which we will use to decontaminate the cluster cmd .",
    "47 tuc is an extremely large and crowded gc . in our data",
    ", it covers more than 300,000 stars with @xmath18 $ ] mag . because of the effects of mass segregation ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , almost all of the more massive ( @xmath19 ) , bright ( @xmath20 mag ) cluster stars are contained within the central region , which dramatically increases the background level in the cluster core because of the extended , faint wings of the psf profile . in the central region , almost all stars fainter than @xmath2115 mag will fade into the background because of a combination of the enhanced background level and stellar crowding in our ground - based images .",
    "for these reasons , we only use the 3071 stars brighter than @xmath22 mag , in essence hb stars and a fraction of the cluster s bright rgb and asymptotic - giant - branch stars , to determine the cluster center . our approach to find the cluster center is identical to that employed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we first selected a sufficiently large rectangular area that clearly contained the full cluster region and then divided the stellar spatial distributions into 500 bins in both the right ascension ( @xmath23 ) and declination ( @xmath24 ) directions . in both spatial coordinates ,",
    "the stellar number densities follow gaussian - like profiles , which allow us to determine the coordinates corresponding to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) maximum stellar density .",
    "the resulting center coordinates are @xmath25 ; statistical uncertainty @xmath26 .",
    "our approach introduces negligible biases , because the member stars of extremely old gcs should all have adapted their kinematics to be in equilibrium with the prevailing gravitational potential , so that both the bright stars ( which we excluded from our analysis ) and their fainter companions experience the same gravitational potential .",
    "our result is consistent with previous determinations of the cluster center by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we subsequently selected a second region centered at @xmath27 , @xmath28 , with a radius of 600@xmath6 , to calculate the background stellar number density ( for stars with @xmath29 mag ) . the vast majority of stars in this region are foreground milky way and background smc stars ; contamination by 47 tuc members at these large radii is @xmath30% , an estimate based on careful assessment of the cluster s extended radial profile .",
    "this region is a suitable choice for a `` field '' region , because its center is located more than 2400@xmath6 from the cluster center , a distance that is close to the cluster s tidal radius ( @xmath31 pc @xmath32 for a distance modulus of @xmath33 mag or a distance of 4.6 kpc , derived below ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this is unlikely to significantly affect our field - star characterization .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of a significant population of extratidal stars , however .",
    "@xcite predicted that 47 tuc should exhibit at least one extratidal tail , which would cross our observational field of view from the northwest to the southeast .",
    "we hence selected a region in the northeast of our field of view as field reference so as to avoid contamination by extratidal - tail stars as much as possible .",
    "in fact , we found that the stellar number density in the southeast is indeed significantly higher than that in the northeast .",
    "we next compared the cluster s stellar number density with that of the background field to check at which radius , @xmath34 , the cluster s stellar number density becomes indistinguishable from the background level .",
    "we determined @xmath35 , and hence adopted a cluster `` size '' of 1200@xmath6 for further study , equivalent to approximately 50% of its tidal radius .",
    "this is a conservative choice , because we eliminated the brightest stars from our analysis .",
    "mass segregation will cause an underestimation of the `` bright '' cluster size compared with that resulting from having adopted a homogeneous stellar sample .",
    "however , even if we were to select a smaller cluster size , our results still strongly indicate the presence of multiple stellar generations .",
    "figure [ f1 ] displays the stellar spatial distribution of stars brighter than @xmath36 mag .",
    "we also show the stars in the adopted field region ( blue circle ) , characterized by a radius of 600@xmath6 .",
    "the cluster region is indicated by the red circle . in figure [ f2 ]",
    "we display the radial stellar number - density profile ( on a logarithmic scale ) , where the black solid line indicates the field stellar density level and the vertical black dashed line indicates the radius , @xmath37 , where the cluster s stellar number density becomes indistinguishable from that of the background .",
    "next , we adopted the most suitable isochrone describing our photometric data , using model isochrones based on the pgpuc stellar evolution code ( * ? ? ? * with @xmath38 as its basis ) .",
    "we adopted an age for 47 tuc of 12.5 gyr or @xmath39 ( cf .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a metallicity of @xmath40 or @xmath41}=-0.55 $ ] dex .",
    "the latter value is consistent with the determination of @xcite ( note that these authors adopted [ m / h ] @xmath42 dex instead of [ fe / h ] ; [ m / h ] = @xmath43 [ fe / h ] , where @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "we simply adopt an average value of @xmath45 . ) the adopted extinction , @xmath46 mag , is equal to that determined and adopted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we also need to adopt a suitable value for the [ @xmath47/fe ] ratio .",
    "@xcite determined [ @xmath47/fe ] = 0.40 dex .",
    "we hence adopted the maximum value available in the pgpuc code , [ @xmath47/fe ] = 0.30 dex , to generate the most representative isochrone for the bulk of the cluster stars ; we found that this small offset between the most appropriate and closest - available model-[@xmath47/fe ] values will not introduce significant fitting problems .",
    "based on these input parameters , the best - fitting distance modulus to 47 tuc is @xmath48 mag , which is consistent with the determinations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we next performed field - star decontamination .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ f1 ] , we selected stars from a suitably chosen nearby region as our reference to statistically correct for background contamination .",
    "we selected a field region covering a circular area with a radius of 600@xmath6 , which corresponds to one quarter of the adopted cluster area , and compared the corresponding cmds . for every star in the cmd of the field region",
    ", we removed the closest four counterparts ( thus correcting for the difference in the cluster versus field areas adopted ) in the corresponding cmd of the cluster .",
    "although any such star may not individually be a genuine field star , this approach nevertheless ensures that the cluster cmd is decontaminated statistically robustly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we mainly focus on sgb and rgb stars , while very few of the field stars in the region adopted for field - star decontamination are this bright .",
    "this hence supports the reliability of our statistical decontamination approach .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the decontaminated cluster cmd , including all stars located within 1200@xmath6 of the cluster center , as well as the most appropriate isochrone given the cluster s overall parameters .",
    "the color scale represents the distance to the cluster center .",
    "a quick glance at this figure already suggests a systematic difference between the cluster stars in the innermost region and in the cluster s periphery .",
    "even if we ignore the ms stars due to a lack of accurate data in the cluster s core region ( because of low completeness at these relatively faint magnitudes in the inner region ; see figure [ f4 ] ) , the sgb and rgb stars exhibit a clear difference as a function of radius .",
    "sgb stars at large radii are systematically brighter than those located in the central regions ; they join the rgb at clearly bluer colors compared with the color range characteristic of the innermost rgb stars , hence implying higher characteristic temperatures .",
    "all stars shown in figure [ f3 ] have photometric uncertainties of less than 0.02 mag .",
    "it is thus clear that the broadening of both the sgb and the rgb can not be only owing to photometric uncertainties .    because of the complicated physical conditions affecting our 47 tuc observations ( including those caused by significant mass segregation and frequent stellar blending due to crowding effects ) , most faint stars have very large photometric uncertainties , while some of the brightest stars ( @xmath49 mag ) are partially saturated .",
    "this latter effect also introduces large photometric uncertainties .",
    "we therefore removed those stars in our overall sample that have photometric uncertainties in excess of 0.02 mag in all three filters .",
    "this resulted in a final working sample that contained the @xmath5030% of stars with the highest - accuracy photometry in the corresponding magnitude range .",
    "note that because of the crowding in the cluster s core region , more centrally located stars will have larger errors ( for the same source brightness ) , which hence may introduce an additional bias . to quantify such a bias , we used artificial - star ( as ) tests to study the systematic effects of crowding on the uncertainties in the resulting psf photometry .",
    "we added @xmath51 ass to the raw image and subsequently measured them in the same manner as our sample of real stars , using psf photometry .",
    "the number of ass is roughly 20 times larger than the number of real stars . to avoid a situation in which the ass affect or even dominate the background level and cause crowding artifacts , we only add 3500 stars to the raw image at",
    "any given time .",
    "although this choice implies that there is a ( very small ) probability that two ass may blend with each other , adopting a much smaller number of ass at a time would significantly increase the computational cost of our as tests .",
    "( we quantified the effects of ass blending with other ass , and found the possibility of such a situation occurring to be negligible . )",
    "we repeated this procedure 2000 times .",
    "the distribution of the ass followed a spatial distribution that reproduced the cluster shape derived from bright stars , as well as a distribution in the color  magnitude diagram that resembled the real distribution .",
    "the resulting as catalog contains the input and recovered ( output ) magnitudes , as well as the photometric errors computed as output - input magnitudes .",
    "we carefully assessed any systematic effects of the photometric uncertainties on our psf photometry owing to crowding .",
    "the main result of these as tests is that the positions in the cmd of the sgb and rgb stars that we are concerned with in this study are negligibly affected . however , the photometric errors for stars in the central region are larger than the errors resulting from the use of daophot , for the same object , while there is good agreement between both sets of photometric - error measurements in the outer regions , as expected .",
    "this effect only becomes important for stars that are fainter than the msto ; for their brighter counterparts the deviation is negligible .",
    "our results hence confirm that the spread in the sgb / rgb is real .",
    "the as tests also allow us to estimate the photometric completeness of our stellar catalog .",
    "the crowding in the cluster s central regions affects the ass in a similar way as the real cluster members .",
    "we generated artificial stars that were homogeneously distributed across the same region as the observations .",
    "those ass that returned either no photometric measurement or that were characterized by a difference in output - input magnitude that was greater than five times their photometric uncertainties were considered stars that could not be recovered ( hence tracing the level of completeness of the observations ) . figure [ f4 ] displays the cumulative 2d completeness map as a function of both radius and @xmath9 magnitude .",
    "we start by focusing on the region occupied by the sgb stars .",
    "first , we select a box delineated by @xmath52 $ ] mag and @xmath53 $ ] mag .",
    "although this selection is quite arbitrary , we only need to ensure that the region contains the vast majority of sgb stars .",
    "because the photometry of stars in this magnitude range is more accurate than that of the faint(er ) ms stars , we further impose a maximum photometric uncertainty of 0.015 mag .",
    "this constraint leaves us with the @xmath54% of stars with the highest - accuracy photometry in the corresponding part of cmd space .",
    "we next adopt the cluster - wide ridge line as our standard model .",
    "the locus of the sgb ridge line is determined by connecting the loci of the maximum stellar number density as a function of color .",
    "we calculate the magnitude difference with respect to this observational ridge line for all stars in our sgb sample , @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting magnitude dispersion is distributed in a gaussian - like fashion with @xmath56 mag .",
    "we remove stars that were found beyond 3@xmath57 mag of the ridge line , resulting in a sample of 1389 stars : see figure [ f5 ] .",
    "figure [ f5 ] shows that the sgb stars in the cluster s periphery are systematically found above the ridge line , i.e. , they are brighter compared with their more centrally located counterparts .",
    "we divide the sgb sample into five annuli as a function of radius to check whether and  if so  how their magnitude dispersion varies with radius .",
    "the four boundaries between subsequent annuli were set at @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , which resulted in roughly equal stellar numbers ( ranging from 269 to 283 ) per radial bin . for each radial bin",
    ", we calculate the distribution of the stellar magnitude dispersion , normalized to the total number of stars in the relevant bin .",
    "we use these distributions to calculate the probability distribution of @xmath62 in each radial bin , as shown in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "based on figure [ f6 ] , it is clear that the sgb stars in the innermost radial bin ( top panel ) are systematically fainter ( @xmath63 mag ) than those in the cluster s periphery ( bottom panel ) . as a function of increasing radius",
    ", the mean magnitude of the bulk of the sgb stars becomes gradually brighter ( @xmath64 mag ) .",
    "we also note that for the central sample , the magnitude dispersion of the central sgb stars is larger than that of the peripheral sgb sample .",
    "this is as expected , because the observed stellar distribution is a 2d projection onto the plane of the sky : the stars in the peripheral sample are indeed located far from the cluster center , but the innermost stars are significantly contaminated by stars that are physically located at larger radii .",
    "therefore , if the properties of the sgb stars at large radii differ systematically from those in the innermost sample , the contaminated innermost sample will exhibit a larger magnitude dispersion .",
    "in addition , blending of unresolved stars that are physically not associated with each other but located along the same line of sight will also cause a dispersion of sgb stars to brighter magnitudes .",
    "such blending events can happen anywhere , but they are expected to occur more frequently in the cluster s innermost regions , where the stellar number density is highest . both of these effects will cause a bias to brighter magnitudes that predominantly affects the innermost sgb stars .",
    "it is thus natural to expect that the intrinsic distribution of sgb stars in the cluster core would be narrower than observed . in figure [ f7 ]",
    "we show the cmd of sgb stars at @xmath65 ( i.e. , the innermost radial bin ) , as well as that composed of sgb stars at @xmath66 $ ] ( i.e. , the outermost radial bin adopted ) .",
    "it is clear that the most centrally located sgb stars are more dispersed ( in magnitude ) than the peripheral sgb stars ; both samples are clearly different .",
    "we use a monte carlo method to estimate how many projected stars at large radii will contaminate the stellar sample drawn from the inner regions ( cf .",
    "for example , if we want to estimate the contamination of sgb stars in the ring defined by @xmath67 $ ] , where @xmath68 , we first calculate how many sgb stars are located at @xmath69 , say @xmath70 .",
    "we then assume that these @xmath71 stars are located in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) spherical shell at @xmath72 $ ] , where @xmath73 is the cluster size .",
    "the 3d stellar density at @xmath72 $ ] is then @xmath74 we next generate a 3d spherical cluster of size @xmath34 , which hence contains @xmath75 artificial stars .",
    "the artificial stars are homogeneously distributed with density @xmath76 .",
    "we now randomly select a given direction to represent the line - of - sight direction ; the number of stars located at @xmath77 that will be projected at @xmath78 $ ] is referred to as @xmath79 . for each radial bin",
    ", we repeat this process 10 times to calculate the average @xmath79 and obtain an approximate projected number of stars in the radial annulus of interest .",
    "because only stars at @xmath77 will cause contamination of a ring at @xmath67 $ ] , even if we assume that the average density of stars at @xmath77 is homogeneous and that they are spherically distributed , which will underestimate the real stellar density in the region at @xmath80 , this will not affect our estimation .",
    "the resulting ratio of the projected contamination indicates , for example , that for the sample drawn from the ( projected ) innermost radii , @xmath65 , 103 stars are actually physically located at @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , for the radial range @xmath82 $ ] , only 43 stars will be located beyond @xmath83 along the line - of - sight direction .",
    "if we normalize the total number of stars that we observe in each projected radial bin , the contamination due to line - of - sight projection decreases from 36% for the innermost radii ( @xmath65 ) to 16% for the penultimate radial range ( @xmath82 $ ] ) .",
    "we have assumed that for radii @xmath66 $ ] the effects of projection are negligible . because more than half of the central sgb stars are , in fact ,",
    "peripheral stars that have been projected along the line - of - sight , it is not strange that the magnitude dispersion of the innermost sgb stars is larger than that of the peripheral sample(s ) .",

    "a similar result is presented by @xcite , who found that the fraction of rgbb stars increases from @xmath5040% to @xmath5090% from the cluster s outskirts to its central regions .",

    "the second generation stars would more likely have formed within the denser core region of the cluster , and their clearly different distributions suggest that the second - generation stars may originally have been dominated ( in terms of stellar numbers ) by first - generation stars , but that most first - generation stars subsequently somehow escaped from the cluster .",
    "this may be owing to expansion of the cluster triggered by either type ii supernovae @xcite or tidal stripping @xcite , which eventually led to a system with second - generation stars preferentially distributed closer to the cluster center .",

    "the corresponding probability distribution shows a continuous ridge from the cluster s outer edge to @xmath96 , followed by a peak between @xmath97 and @xmath94 . for both sgb stars and rgb stars ,",
    "the stars located at the largest radii are clearly different from the innermost sample stars .",
    "we used a monte carlo method to estimate the contamination due to line - of - sight projection as a function of radius and conclude that the innermost radial ranges are , in fact , seriously contaminated by projected peripheral stars .",
    "this explains the larger magnitude ( color ) dispersion of the innermost sgb ( rgb ) stars compared with their counterparts at larger radii .",
    "in fact , if we could properly reconstruct the 3d distribution of the observed stars , the inner stellar sample would most likely be more clearly different from the outer sample .",
    "we use different models in our attempts at explaining the observations , including dispersions in helium abundance , [ @xmath98 , metallicity , and age .",
    "the most promising explanation is that the observed sgb and rgb stars are characterized by variations in helium and metal abundance , with the peripheral stars being both more helium - poor ( y = 0.25 ) and more metal - poor ( @xmath99 ) , while the more centrally located stars are likely both more helium - rich ( y = 0.28 ) and more metal - rich ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the effects of [ @xmath98 variations are negligible ; our photometric data are insufficiently sensitive to trace any such differences .",
    "the helium - rich , metal - rich sample is also consistent with a relatively younger isochrone , with age of 12.25 gyr , while the helium - poor , metal - poor sample follows a 12.75 gyr isochrone .",
    "an age dispersion of @xmath1 gyr is required to best match the morphologies of both the sgb and rgb stars . in this context , the helium - abundance and metallicity dispersion invoked to explain the majority of the broadening of the cmd features would have originated from contamination by first - generation stars .",
    "we generate a series of simulated cmds covering both the sgb and rgb stars , and use a @xmath101-minimization method to quantify the best - fitting first - generation stellar fraction .",
    "the result shows a clear , increasing trend from the innermost region to the cluster outskirts .",
    "this indicates that only a very small fraction of first - generation stars is contained in the cluster core , while the stellar population in the outskirts is close to a simple stellar population .",
    "the @xmath101-minimization results also show excellent agreement for both the sgb and rgb stars , both as regards the trend and the actual values , at least for @xmath102 at @xmath103 $ ] , which strongly indicates that the sgb and rgb stars share the same stellar population composition .",
    "based on the analysis presented in this article , we thus confirm that 47 tuc is composed of more than one stellar population .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the origin of a second stellar generation is that it is the remnant of the first stellar generation with enhanced helium abundance ( from y = 0.25 to y = 0.28 ) , as well as enhanced metallicity ( from @xmath99 to @xmath100 ) .",
