    "the virtual photon behaves as a source of partons , one of which takes part in the hard subprocess .",
    "one of the main signatures of a resolved process is that of the low @xmath7 photon remnant , the partons produced by the photon which did not take part in the scatter .",
    "the fraction of the photon s four momentum entering the hard dijet subprocess , @xmath6 , is now less than unity .",
    "an example of each process is shown in figure  1 .",
    "on the left is an example of the diagram corresponding to a direct process , on the right is an example of a resolved process .",
    "[ fdiags ]      experimentally @xmath6 can not be measured directly , so the variable @xmath9 is chosen as an estimator of the fraction of the photon s momentum that takes part in the hard scatter .",
    "@xmath9 is then the fraction of the photon momentum manifest in the two highest @xmath7 jets and is defined by the equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the transverse energy of jet @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the pseudorapidity of the jet , and @xmath14 is the inelasticity of the event .    the fact that jets of hadrons are measured , and not partons means that the value of @xmath9 is dependent upon the jet finding algorithm used , and hadronisation effects .",
    "events with a high value of @xmath9 are mostly direct processes , low @xmath9 resolved processes . as a result of this , `` direct enriched '' events are classed as being those with @xmath15 , and `` resolved enriched '' events as those with @xmath16 .",
    "this is an experimental definition , since there are still true resolved events with @xmath15 , and vice versa , but the contamination between the two event classes is minimised by having the cut at this value .",
    "the cross section that is measured is defined by the following set of kinematic cuts      three different q@xmath1 regions are accessed , firstly q@xmath24 gev@xmath1 corresponds to quasi - real photons , where the electron is not tagged , and the large bulk of such events lead to a median q@xmath1 of 0.001 gev@xmath1 . for",

    "is tagged in the zeus main calorimeter @xcite .",
    "figure  [ ratio ] contains the dijet cross sections shown as a ratio of resolved enriched over direct enriched as a function of q@xmath1 . since certain systematic errors cancel in the ratio , this is a more precise measurement than absolute differential cross sections .",
    "the ratio is also sensitive in shape ( but not normalisation ) to the photon pdf , even when the absolute cross section given by herwig 5.9 @xcite does not match the data .",
    "one can see that grv lo @xcite is flat , as expected , since it has no q@xmath1 dependence .",
    "the effect of multi - parton interactions is to increase the ratio , but again for grv lo this is flat vs q@xmath1 .",
    "the lepto 6.5.1 @xcite prediction is also flat since this contains direct processes only .",
    "even with direct only processes , the ratio of resolved enriched over direct enriched cross sections is non - zero , demonstrating that @xmath9 is sensitive to the jet finding algorithm and hadronisation effects , and hence has a reduced correlation with @xmath6 .",
    "the data is approaching this direct only limit , however resolved processes are still required in order to describe the data up to a q@xmath1 of 4.5  gev@xmath1 .",
    "the schuler and sjstrand ( sas1d ) photon pdf @xcite does have a suppresion of parton densities in the photon vs q@xmath1 , and this can be clearly seen from the shape of the curves .",
    "the effect of multi - parton interactions is small for this pdf , and both curves approach the data for the higher q@xmath1 bins , whilst disagreeing for lower q@xmath1 values . given the size of the errors on the data , the shape of these curves is consistent with the zeus data .",
