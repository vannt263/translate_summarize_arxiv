    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the simplest possible @xmath2 supersymmetric extension of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "it has the gauge group @xmath3 , replaces each gauge field by a vector supermultiplet , each matter fermion by a chiral supermultiplet , has a conjugate pair of higgs chiral superfields and has no right - handed neutrino multiplets .",
    "the mssm was introduced in various contexts in @xcite and has been extensively reviewed in  @xcite . however , without further modification , the most general superpotential for the mssm contains cubic interactions that explicitly violate both lepton and baryon number and lead , among other things , to rapid proton decay  which is unobserved .",
    "the traditional solution to this problem is to demand that , in addition to the gauge group , the mssm be invariant under an ad hoc @xmath4 finite symmetry@xmath5-parity  which acts on individual component fields as @xmath6 .",
    "although there have been many attempts to explain how @xmath5-parity can arise in the mssm  @xcite or be spontaneously broken  @xcite .",
    "these are all `` non - minimal '' in the sense , for example , that they require additional matter multiplets , have other ad hoc assumptions and so on . is there a more natural and minimal approach to @xmath5-parity in the mssm ?",
    "one begins by noting that , within the context of supersymmetry , @xmath5-parity is a finite subgroup of @xmath7see for example @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath5-parity might arise as a consequence of demanding that the mssm be invariant under a global @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "this would be consistent with current bounds on baryon and lepton number violation , and can also be imposed on the mssm extended to include three families of right - handed neutrino chiral supermultiplets .",
    "however , one of the implications of the standard model is that a global continuous symmetry group is likely to appear in its local form  that is , as a gauge symmetry . with this in mind",
    ", one might ask if @xmath5-parity could arise as the consequence of extending the mssm gauge group to include a new gauged @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "it has long been known that the standard mssm is anomalous with respect to gauged @xmath0 symmetry , whereas the mssm extended by three families of right - handed neutrino supermultiplets is anomaly free .",
    "furthermore , this is the minimal such extension of the mssm .",
    "we will call this anomaly free , minimal content theory the @xmath0 mssm , and propose that this is a more `` natural '' way in which @xmath5-parity can arise in low energy supersymmetric particle physics .",
    "the @xmath0 mssm was identified from a low - energy `` bottom - up '' point of view in @xcite@xmath8see  @xcite for a similar idea in the context of @xmath9 . ] . in several papers @xcite",
    ", these authors explored its structure and some phenomenological consequences .",
    "in addition , these ideas , and other directions , have recently been reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath0 mssm was also discovered from a high - energy `` top - down '' viewpoint in @xcite , where it was shown that this model arises within the context of heterotic superstring theory @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath0 mssm is the low - energy effective theory associated with compactifying the @xmath10 heterotic string on a schoen calabi - yau threefold @xcite with a specific class of @xmath11 vector bundles @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of this high - energy point of view is that the parameters of the theory are specified near the gauge coupling unification scale , and then run down to the electroweak scale using the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "this allows one to explore fundamental aspects of the theory  such as @xmath0 and electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "first steps in this direction were taken in @xcite , where it was shown  for a restrictive set of initial parameters  that radiative breaking of both of these symmetries can indeed occur .",
    "a further study of the wilson lines , spectra , mass scales and the unification of gauge couplings from the high - energy superstring point of view was presented in @xcite . combining the bottom - up and top - down approaches to the @xmath0 mssm",
    ", various aspects of both lhc and neutrino phenomenology were studied in the special case where a stop or a sbottom sparticle is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) @xcite .",
    "however , all of the previous analyses involved specific assumptions  either about high - energy initial conditions or the low - energy structure of the theory . for the @xmath0 mssm",
    "to be a realistic contender for the low - energy theory of particle physics , it is essential that its initial parameter space be explored in a generic way , and that its low - energy predictions be compared with all present experimental data .",
    "this will be carried out in detail in this paper .",
    "we perform a statistical scan over a well - defined and wide range of initial parameters and , for each fixed set of such parameters , scale the theory down to low energy using the rges with specified threshold conditions .",
    "the results will be examined to determine the subset of the parameter space that , sequentially , 1 ) breaks @xmath0 symmetry at a scale consistent with experiment , 2 ) breaks electroweak symmetry , 3 ) has all sparticle masses above their present experimental lower bounds and 4 ) predicts the mass of the lightest neutral higgs scalar to be within 2@xmath12 standard deviation from the atlas measured value of 125.36 gev .",
    "a small subset of important results from this statistical scan were given in @xcite .",
    "here , we give present the details of the method use , as well as a wide array of new results and experimental predictions .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , the @xmath0 mssm model at the tev scale is described in detail .",
    "this includes a discussion of both @xmath0 and electroweak symmetry breaking and much of our notation .",
    "the connection between the uv picture at the scale of gauge coupling unification and the tev scale is outlined in section  [ sec : unif ] .",
    "specifically , the important mass scales and energy regimes are fully described and the relationships between the different mass scales are presented .",
    "the content of these two sections is expanded upon in section  [ sec:1115 ] . here , the details of the renormalization group equation ( rge ) evolution of the parameters of the theory between the uv and tev scales are discussed .",
    "this includes the appropriate input values of the parameters and the relevant equations  with reference to appendix  [ sec:719 ] when necessary .",
    "special attention is given to the right - handed sneutrino rge which drives radiative @xmath0 symmetry breaking .",
    "the relationship between the different running parameters and scales  introduced in section  [ sec : unif]is further discussed . the latter part of this section outlines the experimental bounds used in our analysis .",
    "first , collider bounds are discussed .",
    "these correspond to lower bounds on the physical sparticle masses  which are closely related to the running mass parameters .",
    "the section finishes by describing  and implementing  the well - known bounds from flavor changing neutral currents and cp violation .",
    "this paper approaches the connection between uv and tev physics in a novel way .",
    "specifically , instead of assuming some universal conditions or relationships between uv soft susy breaking parameters , we simply allow all such parameters to be within about an order of magnitude of some chosen susy breaking scale .",
    "our approach will then be to scan all relevant susy breaking parameters , at the high scale , over this possible range .",
    "these parameters will then be rg evolved to the tev scale , following the discussion in section  [ sec:1115 ] .",
    "this very general approach , as well as other details of our scan , are described in section  [ sec:1141 ] .",
    "such an approach is especially applicable to the string realization of the @xmath0 mssm model , since , in that case , each chiral supermultiplet arises from a different @xmath13 representation of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , their soft susy breaking masses do not obey boundary conditions at the high scale .",
    "our analysis is also valid for a wide range of pure guts , which can impose disparate boundary conditions at the unification scale  including none at all .",
    "finally a `` meta '' scan is conducted to choose the optimal value for the range of susy breaking mass scales .",
    "the optimal range , arrived at in section  [ sec:1141 ] , is used to generate all subsequent results in this paper  the bulk of which are presented in section  [ sec:1058 ] . relating these results to the twenty - four phenomenologically relevant scanned parameters",
    "is daunting at best .",
    "fortunately , a cohesive picture can be presented in terms of two so - called @xmath15-parameters .",
    "these @xmath15-parameters , which are each the sum of the squares of susy breaking mass parameters , play an important role in radiative @xmath0 symmetry breaking .",
    "their role in this capacity is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1204 ] .",
    "the results for all other experimental constraints can also be expressed in terms of these two parameters  see fig .",

    "a central result of this work is given is fig .",
    "[ fig:1039 ] , which displays the frequency at which particles appear as lsps in our scan .",
    "the section closes with histograms of the spectra , as well as some spectrum plots to help characterize specific features of our results .",
    "fine - tuning in our approach is addressed in section  [ sec : ft ] . while fine - tuning in the @xmath0 mssm is not drastically different than in the mssm , there are several key issues to highlight .",
    "first , while one might expect that the scale associated with @xmath0 symmetry breaking could introduce new contributions to fine - tuning , it is shown that this is not the case .",
    "second , the mssm , analyzed using the same methods as in this paper , typically yields equal or more fine - tuning than in the our model for similar initial points . finally , an lsp analysis similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:1039 ] , but with fine - tuning constrained to be better than one part in a thousand , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:417 ] . we conclude in section  [ sec :",

    "in addition to the main sections of this paper , three appendices are included to help elucidate various topics .",
    "appendix  [ sec:719 ] contains all one - loop rges for this model in the different regimes .",
    "the first part of appendix  [ sec:131 ] specifies how to relate the running soft mass parameters to the physical masses of the susy particles .",
    "the second part of appendix  [ sec:131 ] describes the procedure used to calculate the sm - like higgs mass .",
    "those readers interested in the details of how the random scan in this paper was conducted , are directed to appendix  [ sec:536 ] .",
    "motivated by both phenomenological considerations and string theory , we analyze the minimal anomaly free extension of the mssm with gauge group @xmath16 as discussed in  @xcite , we prefer to work with the abelian factors @xmath17 rather than @xmath18 although they are physically equivalent .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the former is the unique choice that does not introduce kinetic mixing between the associated field strengths at any scale in their renormalization group equation ( rge ) evolution .",
    "the gauge covariant derivative can be written as d =- ii_3rg_rw_r - ig_blb^  , where @xmath19 is the @xmath20 charge and the factor of @xmath21 is introduced in the last term by a redefinition of the gauge coupling @xmath22 thus simplifying many equations .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite and throughout this paper , a radiatively induced vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for a right - handed sneutrino will spontaneously break the abelian factors @xmath23 to @xmath24 , in analogy with the way that the higgs fields break @xmath25 to @xmath26 in the sm . for simplicity , we will refer to this as `` @xmath0 '' symmetry breaking  even though it is technically the breaking of a linear combination of the @xmath20 and @xmath7 generators , leaving the hypercharge group generated by y = i_3r + invariant .",
    "the particle content of the minimal model is simply that of the mssm plus three right - handed neutrino chiral multiplets .",
    "that is , three generations of matter superfields @xmath27 along with two higgs supermultiplets @xmath28 we refer to this model throughout the remainder of this paper as the @xmath0 mssm .",
    "the superpotential of the @xmath0 mssm is given by @xmath29 where flavor and gauge indices have been suppressed and the yukawa couplings are three - by - three matrices in flavor space . in principle , the yukawa matrices are arbitrary complex matrices . however , the observed smallness of the three ckm mixing angles and the cp - violating phase dictate that the quark yukawa matrices be taken to be nearly diagonal and real .",
    "the lepton yukawa coupling matrix can also be chosen to be diagonal and real .",
    "this is accomplished by moving the rotation angles and phases into the neutrino yukawa couplings which , henceforth , must be complex matrices .",
    "furthermore , the smallness of the first and second family fermion masses implies that all components of the up , down , and lepton yukawa couplings  with the exception of the ( 3,3 ) components  can be neglected for the purposes of this paper .",
    "similarly , the very light neutrino masses imply that the neutrino yukawa couplings are sufficiently small so as to be neglected for the purposes of this paper .",
    "the @xmath30-parameter can be chosen to be real , but not necessarily positive , without loss of generality .",
    "the soft supersymmetry breaking lagrangian is then given by @xmath31 the @xmath32 parameter can be chosen to be real and positive without loss of generality .",
    "the gaugino soft masses can , in principle , be complex .",
    "this , however , could lead to cp - violating effects that are not observed .",
    "therefore , we proceed by assuming they all are real .",
    "the @xmath33-parameters and scalar soft mass can , in general , be hermitian matrices in family space .",
    "again , however , this could lead to unobserved flavor and cp violation .",
    "therefore , we will assume they all are diagonal and real .",
    "furthermore , we assume that only the ( 3,3 ) components of the up , down , and lepton @xmath33-parameters are significant and that the neutrino @xmath33 parameters are negligible . for more explanation of these assumptions , see section [ sec:857 ] .    spontaneous breaking of @xmath0 symmetry results from a right - handed sneutrino developing a non - vanishing vev , since it carries the appropriate @xmath19 and @xmath0 charges . however",
    ", since sneutrinos are singlets under the @xmath34 gauge group , it does not break any of the sm symmetries . to acquire a vev",
    ", a right - handed sneutrino must develop a tachyonic mass parameter is negative .",
    "although all @xmath35 parameters at high scale will be chosen positive , one or more can be driven negative at lower energy by radiative corrections .",
    "this signals dynamical instability at the origin  although a stable vev may , or may not , develop . ] . as discussed in @xcite , a vev",
    "can only be generated in one linear combination of the right - handed sneutrinos .",
    "furthermore , beyond the fact that its vev breaks @xmath0 symmetry , in which combination it occurs has no further observable effect .",
    "this is because there is no right - handed charged current to link the right - handed neutrinos to a corresponding right - handed charged lepton .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , one can assume that it is the third generation right - handed sneutrino that acquires a vev .",
    "at a lower mass scale , electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken by the neutral components of both the up and down higgs multiplets acquiring non - zero vev s .",
    "in combination with the right - handed sneutrino vev , this also induces a vev in each of the three generations of left - handed sneutrinos .",
    "the notation for the relevant vevs is v_r ,   _ i ,   v_u ,   v_d , where @xmath36 is the generation index .",
    "the neutral gauge boson that becomes massive due to @xmath0 symmetry breaking , @xmath37 , has a mass at leading order , in the relevant limit that @xmath38 , of m_z_r^2 = ( g_r^2+g_bl^2 ) v_r^2 ( 1 + )  , [ eq:237 ] where v^2 v_d^2 + v_u^2  .",
    "the second term in the parenthesis is a small effect due to mixing in the neutral gauge boson sector .",
    "the hypercharge gauge coupling is given by [ eq : y.3r.bl ] g_y = g_r _ r = g_bl_r  , where _ r =  .",
    "since the neutrino masses are roughly proportional to the @xmath39 and @xmath40 parameters , it follows that @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in this",
    "phenomenologically relevant limit , the minimization conditions of the potential are simple and worthwhile to note .",
    "they are @xmath43 here , the first two equations correspond to the sneutrino vevs .",
    "the third and fourth equations are of the same form as in the mssm , but new @xmath0 scale contribution to @xmath44 and @xmath45 shift their values significantly compared to the mssm .",
    "( [ eq : mc.vr ] ) can be used to re - express the @xmath37 mass as [ eq : mzr.mnuc ] m_z_r^2 = -2 m_^c_3 ^ 2 ( 1 + )  .",
    "this makes it clear that , to leading order , the @xmath37 mass is determined by the soft susy breaking mass of the third family right - handed sneutrino .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath46 is insignificant in comparison and , henceforth , neglected in our calculations .",
    "a direct consequence of generating a vev for the third family sneutrino is the spontaneous breaking of @xmath5-parity .",

    ". for lhc studies , see  @xcite as well as recent work on stop and sbottom lsp s in this context and the connection between their decays and the neutrino sector  @xcite .",
    "predictions for the neutrino sector were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the lightest left - handed , or active , neutrino is massless and that the model contains two right - handed neutrinos , referred to as sterile neutrinos , that are lighter than the remaining two active neutrinos .",
    "sterile neutrinos can influence the cosmological evolution of the universe due to their role as dark radiation .",
    "this effect was studied in  @xcite .    in this section",
    ", we have focussed on the tev scale manifestation of the @xmath0 mssm .",
    "however , the main content of this paper will be to study the connection between this low energy theory and its possible origins in @xmath51 heterotic string theory , thereby linking some of the @xmath0 mssm phenomenology to high scale physics . in this context ,",
    "our model is the remnant of an @xmath14 unified symmetry broken by two wilson lines .",
    "although the details of the various physical regimes of this theory , and the renormalization group scaling between them , were given in  @xcite , we review them in the next section for completeness .",
    "the goal of this section is to review the physics associated with the string construction of the @xmath0 mssm  from unification to the electroweak scale .",
    "after compactification to four - dimensions , the unified gauge group is @xmath14 .",
    "this is then further broken to the @xmath0 mssm gauge group by the turning on of two abelian wilson lines , denoted by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "the energy scales associated with these wilson lines need not be the same .",
    "in fact , exact gauge coupling unification at one - loop , which we will assume throughout this paper , requires that the scales be different implying there is a two - step symmetry breaking process from @xmath14 to the gauge group of the @xmath0 mssm .",
    "this leads to an intermediate regime between the two scales associated with the wilson lines .",
    "the particle content and gauge group in this regime depends on which wilson line turns on first . defining the mass scales of @xmath52 and @xmath53 as @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively , we find the following two initial symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "* @xmath56 :  @xmath57 ,  the `` left - right '' model * @xmath58 :  @xmath59 ,  a modified version of the `` pati - salam '' model    in each case , the subsequent turning on of the second wilson line breaks the intermediate model to the @xmath0 mssm .",
    "reference  @xcite studied these two cases and found that gauge coupling unification dictates that the wilson line scales should be separated by less than an order of magnitude ; that is , the intermediate regime is not very large .",
    "it follows that the tev scale physics has little dependence on which of the above two models inhabit the intermediate regime . for simplicity",
    ", we will carry out our analysis under the assumption that it is the first of these symmetry breaking patterns that occurs .",
    "hence , the intermediate regime contains the left - right model .",
    "we then make the identifications @xmath60 these scales will be further discussed below .    in the intermediate regime ,",
    "the particle content of the left - right model consists of nine copies of the matter family @xmath61 two copies of a higgs bi - doublet , which contains the mssm higgs fields , @xmath62 and a pair of color triplets @xmath63 once the second wilson line turns on , the extra particle content integrates out and one is left with exactly the spectrum of the @xmath0 mssm .    at this point , it is important to make a quick note on notation for the @xmath0 gauge coupling .",
    "thus far , we have discussed the gauge parameter @xmath22 , which couples to @xmath64 charge .",
    "as is well known , this gauge coupling has to be properly normalized so as to unify with the other gauge parameters .",

    "the parameter @xmath65 couples to @xmath66 charge and will appear in the rges . for quantities of physical interest , such as physical masses , @xmath22 will be used .    to fully understand the evolution of this model from unification to the electroweak scale",
    ", it should be noted that there are five relevant mass scales of interest , two of which were mentioned briefly above .",

    "although these are numerically small , they have the effect of splitting the masses of the otherwise degenerate @xmath168 doublets , which has implications for the lightest supersymmetric particle ( see section  [ sec:1058 ] ) : @xmath257 where @xmath258 is the weak mixing angle ( @xmath259 ) and @xmath260 and @xmath261 are the left - handed isospin and electric charge of the scalar @xmath145 . here",
    "we lay out the physical masses with the electroweak @xmath140-term contributions , along with the notation for the physical masses . @xmath262",
    "the third - family right - handed sneutrino physical state ( referred to as @xmath263 ) mass is different because it acquires mass through the @xmath0 symmetry breaking mechanism and is degenerate with the @xmath37 mass .    the yukawa and tri - scalar couplings associated with third - family squarks and charged sleptons contribute non - negligible mixing terms among these scalars .",
    "these effects are captured in the stop , sbottom , and stau mixing matrices .",
    "here we use the conventional notation @xmath264 .",
    "the stop mixing matrix in the basis @xmath265 is for simplicity .",
    "however , for numerical evaluation these fermion masses are replaced with the appropriate higgs vev times yukawa coupling evaluated at the susy scale . ]",
    "@xmath266 the eigenstates of this matrix will be referred to as @xmath147 and @xmath159 with mass eigenvalues defined such that @xmath267 .",

    "all of the running parameters in these matrices are evaluated at the susy scale .    for any of these matrices , @xmath272 the relevant mixing angle is given by @xmath273 where the angle @xmath274 may always be chosen to be between @xmath275 and @xmath276 . defined this way ,",
    "a mixing angle close to zero means the lighter mass eigenstate consists of mostly the left - handed gauge eigenstate and a mixing angle close to @xmath276 means the lighter state is mostly right - handed .",
    "the chargino content is identical to that of the mssm in the approximation of vanishing @xmath5-parity violation .",
    "this is a good approximation for calculating masses but the mixing with the charged leptons need to be take into account when calculating decays , see  @xcite for example . continuing with the approximation of vanishing @xmath5-parity violation , the results of @xcite may be used .",
    "those results , in our own notation , are @xmath277    in the basis @xmath278 , the neutralino mass matrix is @xmath279 where @xmath280 and @xmath281 etc . as with the charginos , we have assumed that mixing with the left - handed neutrinos , due to @xmath5-parity violation is 0 .",
    "this is good approximation for calculating masses and will be used here , but can not be used when calculating decay rates .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec:1115 ] some of the eigenstates of this matrix have masses associated with the @xmath0 scale while others have masses associated with the susy scale .",
    "a conventional approach to this situation would be to perturbatively diagonalize the matrix in the limit @xmath282 for the right - side - up case or @xmath283 for the upside - down case .",
    "however , these two scales may be comparable so the entire mass matrix must be diagonalized without the use of perturbative methods .",
    "this has the potential to introduce errors since it does nt account for the fact that some states should be integrated out at different scales .",
    "however , the errors will always be small because the @xmath0 and susy scales are always of comparable size .",
    "we choose to evaluate all of the running parameters in this matrix at the susy scale .",
    "the error introduced by doing this should be smaller than the error introduced by associating the entire susy spectrum with a single scale , @xmath132 .",
    "the mass eigenstates are referred to as @xmath284 in a mass ordered basis with eigenvalues @xmath285 .",
    "the physical gluino mass , @xmath286 is simply equal to the running gluino mass evaluated at the susy scale .",
    "supersymmetric models such as the mssm and this @xmath0 mssm contain five higgs particles .",
    "the most important for the present discussion is the lightest neutral sm - like higgs , @xmath288 , which we refer to as `` the higgs '' throughout this paper .",
    "this one is important because its mass is known and can be used to constrain some of the susy parameter space .",
    "the other four higgses are the heavy higgs , @xmath289 , the higgs pseudoscalar , @xmath290 , and the charged higgses , @xmath291 .",
    "the higgs mass is calculated using methods discussed in @xcite .",
    "the physical higgs mass is @xmath292 with the higgs quartic coupling , @xmath293 , evaluated at the scale of the physical higgs mass . above the susy scale",
    ", @xmath293 comes from the @xmath140-terms and is thereby fixed .",
    "below the susy scale , rge effects will cause @xmath293 to deviate from its supersymmetric value .",
    "these effects come mainly from one - loop graphs involving the top quark .",
    "they are contained in the rge for @xmath293 in the sm scaling regime .",
    "we employ results from @xcite .",
    "here we re - state the relevant equations in our own notation .",
    "the supersymmetric boundary condition on @xmath293 is @xmath294 the parameter @xmath295 contains threshold corrections applied at the susy scale . including only the dominant stop contributions from @xcite , @xmath296 where we define @xmath297 (",
    "note that this definition is different from that used in @xcite ) and @xmath298 the rge for @xmath293 in the sm regime is @xmath299 and in the upside - down case between @xmath132 and @xmath73 it is @xmath300 since this depends on the yukawa couplings , which are solved numerically , this must also be solved numerically .",
    "the dominant contributions come from the terms involving @xmath237 .",
    "these terms are present because both stops are integrated out at @xmath132 .",
    "this has the potential to introduce errors because the stops generally do not have the same mass .",
    "the errors introduced by this are minimized when the susy scale is chosen to be @xmath301 .",
    "we find this method of calculating the higgs mass is the best compromise between transparency and accuracy .",
    "regarding the masses of the other four higgses , the tree level results from @xcite apply and are sufficient for the present purposes .",
    "we re - state them here .",
    "in this appendix , we describe  for a single randomly generated initial point  two things : 1 ) the precise algorithm by which the checks described in table  [ tab:320 ] are applied and 2 ) the iterative numerical method used to solve for the @xmath0 and susy scales .",
    "it is necessary to discuss these simultaneously since , as will become clear , they are interrelated .",
    "we include this appendix to give the reader insight into the details of our statistical method and to elucidate technical comments made in the main text .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is helpful to note several things .",
    "a `` point '' here refers to a randomly generated choice of the parameters listed in table  [ tbl : scan ] . for each point",
    ", we make working `` guesses '' of the initial values of @xmath132 and @xmath73 .",
    "these will be iteratively improved using a simple numerical method . for a fixed choice of randomly generated parameters and the two scales",
    "@xmath132 and @xmath73 specified , there is a unique solution for all of the rges and physical masses .",
    "that unique solution is found by our code using a combination of analytic solutions ( discussed throughout this paper ) and numerical methods ( not discussed in this paper ) .",
    "for the purposes of this appendix , it is sufficient to know that the solution can indeed be calculated .",
    "it is also useful to note that , with the exception of the spill and convergence checks , the checks in table  [ tab:320 ] are applied sequentially .",
    "for example , a point is subjected to the ew breaking check if and only if it passes the preceding @xmath0 breaking and @xmath37 bound checks .",
    "this means that a point that fails a particular check a ) has implicitly passed all previous checks and b ) is immediately discarded and never subjected to subsequent checks .",
    "the sequential nature of these checks is what enables us to define the survival rates given in table  [ tab:320 ] .",
    "the spill checks and the convergence check , however , are different because they are not necessarily applied in a particular order and may even be applied multiple times to a single point .",
    "nevertheless , if any point fails a spill or convergence check , at any step in the iterative process , we count that point as having passed all spill checks that appear above the failed check in table  [ tab:320 ] .",
    "this removes any ambiguity about how to define survival rates for the spill and convergence checks .",
    "now we are prepared to discuss the main goals of this appendix . for each",
    "randomly generated point , the initial guesses for @xmath132 and @xmath73 are always taken to be 1 tev and 2.5 tev respectively . if the point with these initial guesses does not satisfy @xmath0 breaking , then we count it as failing the @xmath0 breaking check . if the point does not satisfy the @xmath37 lower bound , then it is so counted . if it does not satisfy ew breaking , then it is so counted .",
    "if it does not satisfy the non - tachyonic stops check , it is so counted .",
    "if the guess for the @xmath0 scale satisfies its definition , that is , if the rg calculation of @xmath303 , to within 1% , and the guess for the susy scale satisfies its definition , that is , the rg calculation of @xmath304 , @xmath305 satisfies @xmath306 to within 1% , then `` convergence '' has occurred and the steps in the next two paragraphs are skipped .    if the guess for the @xmath0 scale satisfies its definition to within 1% , then the rest of the steps in this paragraph are skipped . if not , the guess for the @xmath0 scale is changed to @xmath75 . using the same value for @xmath132 , and the new choice of @xmath73",
    ", we again run the rges for the same initial point . if @xmath307 not within 1% of @xmath73 , then the process is repeated .",
    "if the steps in this paragraph are repeated more than 300 times without success , then we count the point as having failed the convergence check .",
    "if the guess for the susy scale satisfies its definition to within 1% , the rest of the steps in this paragraph are skipped . if not ,",
    "the guess for the susy scale is changed to @xmath308 and we rerun the rges .",
    "if the point now does not satisfy ew breaking , it is counted as failing the ew breaking spill check .",
    "if the point now does not satisfy the non - tachyonic stops check , it is counted as failing the non - tachyonic stops spill check . if it does pass these checks , but @xmath132 does not satisfy its definition to within 1% , then the steps in this paragraph are repeated .",
    "if they have been repeated more than 300 times without success , the point is counted as failing the convergence check .",
    "having successfully passed all of the previous criterion , we now must check the remaining checks .",
    "if the point does not satisfy the @xmath37 bound , it is counted as failing the @xmath0 bound spill check .",
    "if the point does not satisfy the sparticle bounds , it is so counted .",
    "if the point does not satisfy the higgs mass check , it is so counted .",
    "if it does , however , satisfy all of these experimental checks , it is a valid point .       and susy scales works .",
    "every block that begins with the word `` check '' has an outgoing red and green arrow .",
